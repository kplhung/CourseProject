        <p>Mystery Reproduction</p>
        <p>How's your love life? Hopefully it's better than that of a class of small organisms called bdelloids, who haven't had so much as a date in at least 40 million years.</p>
        <p>Bdelloids (like their sex drive, their ''b'' is silent) are rotifers, tiny invertebrates that live in fresh water and other moist habitats. With some 360 described species, bdelloids are the largest class of multicelled animal that reproduces asexually. There are no male bdelloids, and no hermaphrodites either.</p>
        <p>Asexual reproduction is usually thought of as a sure route to extinction. Thus the flourishing of bdelloids for all this time (the oldest specimens have been found in 40-million-year-old amber) has been a puzzle. Some scientists thought the animals might have been having sex behind their backs.</p>
        <p>Researchers at Harvard, reporting in the journal Science, have now provided strong evidence that there has been no hanky-panky. The researchers analyzed chromosome pairs in several bdelloid species, and compared them to pairs from other rotifers that reproduce sexually.</p>
        <p>The bdelloid pairs were found to be fundamentally different from the nonbdelloid pairs, with far more variation in DNA sequences among the pairs. This is a sign that the chromosomal pairs evolved through asexual reproduction over a long time.</p>
        <p>The researchers say that further studies should provide more insight into the reasons bdelloids are exceptions to the general rule that asexual reproduction is an evolutionary dead end.</p>
        <p>An Asteroid Rediscovered</p>
        <p>The asteroid 719 Albert was discovered in 1911 by an astronomer at the Imperial Observatory in Vienna, back in the days of the Austro-Hungarian empire. It was seen on two successive nights in October of that year.</p>
        <p>But then, it seems, Albert went out and never came back. The asteroid disappeared, too faint to be seen even when one of the best telescopes in the world was used to look for it in 1913.</p>
        <p>Now, 89 years after it was lost, Albert has been found again. Astronomers from the University of Arizona discovered an asteroid this month using a telescope at Kitt Peak, and analysis by the Minor Planet Center of the International Astronomical Union determined that it was Albert. With the rediscovery, the location of all the numbered asteroids, of which there are 14,788, is known.</p>
        <p>The rediscovery has enabled astronomers to calculate its orbit more precisely. It is not surprising that it has been hard to find -- its orbit takes it about 300 million miles from the sun. Its initial discovery in 1911 coincided with a time once every 30 years when it comes closest to Earth.</p>
        <p>A Comet Is Discovered</p>
        <p>Albert may have been lost for the better part of a century, but comet K2 was never even found.</p>
        <p>The comet was missed when it passed through the solar system in 1997, although it was bright enough to be seen by professional or amateur astronomers. It has only been discovered now, using what is hardly a comet-watcher -- the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, otherwise known as the Soho spacecraft.</p>
        <p>Soho has an instrument on board that maps the solar wind by measuring emissions from hydrogen atoms at ultraviolet wavelengths. Comets emit large amounts of this same kind of radiation, as water molecules are broken apart by sunlight.</p>
        <p>Using archived data from 1995 to 1998 from the instrument, researchers in Finland and France identified 18 comets, including such well-known ones as Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake. But among five detected from mid-1997 data, the one now called C/1997 K2 was previously unknown.</p>
        <p>While K2 wasn't the brightest light in the firmament, it was brighter than some other comets discovered by amateur astronomers that year. And it stayed at a constant brightness for several months. The researchers, who described the discovery in Nature, say that it points out the need for full-sky comet surveys.</p>
