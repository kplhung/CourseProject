        <p>Allan Houston has been tethered to electric stimulators for three days in an effort to relieve a sore left ankle that may leave him moving as if he were tied down against Indiana's slithering Reggie Miller.</p>
        <p>On the eve of tonight's Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals, Houston was still walking gingerly after rolling his ankle in Friday's Game 6 against the Heat. On Sunday in Game 7, Houston was not too noticeably impaired, but he shot 2 for 10. He was also fortunate to be guarding a jump-shooter like Dan Majerle (3 for 5).</p>
        <p>Miller will not let Houston off so easily. Miller will run Houston through a series of hard screens and try to lose him as he darts through the lane. To chase Miller down, Houston will have to be ready and able to defend him, as well as produce offensively.</p>
        <p>''Guarding Miller is a challenge,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said yesterday in a conference call. ''Allan will have to be as close to 100 percent on Tuesday as possible.</p>
        <p>''I saw Allan today. He says he feels sore. So we'll see. Hopefully, he'll feel better.''</p>
        <p>On Sunday afternoon, Houston had his ankle propped up in the Knicks' locker room after the game. He moved awkwardly as he sat down for the interview session.</p>
        <p>''I thought it would be better than it was,'' Houston said. ''I couldn't attack the basket, and it was kind of hard to get in a rhythm. I did what I could.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully, by Tuesday night, I'll feel a lot better. It's going to get a little better every day.''</p>
        <p>Houston's mobility is imperative to stopping Miller. In the conference finals last year, Houston held Miller to just 36 percent shooting from the field. Miller had a much tougher time with Houston, who shot 41.5 percent and scored 32 points on the night the Knicks eliminated the Pacers in Game 6.</p>
