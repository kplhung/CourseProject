        <p>Republicans across the state began chorusing yesterday that Representative Rick A. Lazio was turning out to be a better Senate candidate than their first choice, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who dropped out last week because of prostate cancer.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Lazio concluded a two-day state campaign flyaround, his fledgling candidacy also received the backing of the state's Conservative Party today, a crucial endorsement that could carry as many as 300,000 votes. No Republican has won a statewide election without the Conservative Party endorsement since 1974. Mr. Giuliani and Michael Long, the chairman of the party, spent much of the last year in a standoff over the endorsement.</p>

        <p>Republicans across the state began chorusing yesterday that Representative Rick A. Lazio was turning out to be a better Senate candidate than their first choice, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who dropped out last week because of prostate cancer.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Lazio concluded a two-day state campaign flyaround, his fledgling candidacy also received the backing of the state's Conservative Party today, a crucial endorsement that could carry as many as 300,000 votes. No Republican has won a statewide election without the Conservative Party endorsement since 1974. Mr. Giuliani and Michael Long, the chairman of the party, spent much of the last year in a standoff over the endorsement.</p>
        <p>''It shows what enthusiasm can do,'' said James Cavanaugh, the Westchester County Republican chairman, who presided over a noisy late-afternoon rally for Mr. Lazio here as hundreds of people happily chanted ''Let's Go Rick!'' and ''Way to Go, Lazio!''</p>
        <p>''He's energizing people in a way that the mayor didn't,'' Mr. Cavanaugh added. ''You know, people would call me up and they would say, 'I want to volunteer for the mayor. What can I do?' And I often didn't know what to ask them to do, because the mayor wasn't really getting out and doing things. People now say, 'Well, what can I do for Rick Lazio?' I've got stuff for them to do. He's made it plain: 'I want rallies. I want people out registering voters.  We're going to do phone banks.' ''</p>
        <p>This was Mr. Lazio's final stop on the 48-hour campaign swing that took him from Long Island to Buffalo to Rochester to Syracuse to Binghamton to Elmira to Utica to Watertown to Albany, and then to Westchester County.</p>
        <p>At every stop, Mr. Lazio was cheerful, disciplined and nearly on time as he repeated his stump speech about working in his father's auto parts shop and growing up clamming in the waters off Long Island, a contrast to his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who moved to the state five months ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, who announced his candidacy on Saturday, also said he would be back again and again.</p>
        <p>''I hope you don't get sick of me, you're going to see me so often,'' he told Republicans at a breakfast in Elmira. In Westchester, he said, ''I hope you don't get sick of me, I'm going to be back so often.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio traveled on a seven-seat jet with his wife and two young daughters, Molly Ann, 7, and Kelsey, 6. In Elmira, the two girls stood on a chair, took the microphone and said, ''Vote for my dad,'' during the hubbub after their father's speech. Republicans who noticed them looked enthralled.</p>
        <p>In Albany, Gov. George E. Pataki and William D. Powers, the state Republican Party chairman, presided over an airport rally of 100 whistling, cheering, clapping supporters.</p>
        <p>''This is a man who 12 hours after he declared his candidacy can get in front of the national media and lay out an agenda for New York because he knows New York,'' Mr. Pataki said. In August, the governor's endorsement of Mr. Giuliani was considerably more lukewarm.</p>
        <p>In Elmira, Sidney S. Graubard, a Chemung County legislator, was equally welcoming of Mr. Lazio. ''In fact, I preferred him all along,'' he said. ''He's got the personality. You can see that he's a clean kind of candidate. Rudy's ignored too many people. He'd be invited to things, and he'd never come up.''</p>
        <p>In fact, so many Republicans were saying such similar things all day that it brought up the question of why they had ever supported Mr. Giuliani in the first place.</p>
        <p>''The machine got behind the mayor,'' said Suzanne Swanson, 56, a Westchester County legislator, who was referring to the party leaders in Albany. But then she added, ''I think what happened was the mayor presented himself as a viable candidate with a war chest to take on Hillary Clinton.''</p>
        <p>Zenia Mucha, the governor's chief political aide, said: ''Everybody's happy. We're all one big happy family.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mucha also said that if reporters missed the oversize personalities and melodrama of the old Hillary-Rudy race, that was fine with her.</p>
        <p>''If reporters are bored by this campaign, then it means it's a good campaign,'' she said.</p>
