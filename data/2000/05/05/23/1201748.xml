        <p>Retreating from his threat to lay off police officers, the Nassau County executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, said this evening that he would go ahead with his plan to delay two weeks' pay to county police officers even though their union refused to ratify it.</p>
        <p>If the union, the Police Benevolent Association, challenges his right to withhold the pay without its ratification, he said, he would lay off at least 207 officers and hold the union responsible for it.</p>
        <p>The union's president, Gary DelaRaba, said, ''We're challenging this. It's illegal.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta had proposed the deferred payment plan, called a lag payroll, in December as a means of temporarily saving the cash-starved county $20 million. It calls for withholding two weeks' salary from all county employees until they leave their jobs.</p>
        <p>Threatened with layoffs unless agreeing to the proposal, the leaders of all the county's municipal unions agreed to the deal in principle and promised to present it to members for a vote. In exchange, they were promised no layoffs for a year. All the unions ratified the plan but one: the Police Benevolent Association.</p>
        <p>When the police union balked, Mr. Gulotta made the politically risky move of threatening to lay off 207 officers -- or 5 percent of the force -- saying the terms of the agreement reached in December left him little choice. But the County Legislature's approval was required for any layoffs, and it refused to act.</p>
        <p>Then, Mr. Gulotta gave the union leaders another ultimatum, saying that if they did not announce their decision on the lag-payroll proposal by this evening, he would interpret their silence as a waiver of their right to ratify the deal.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Mr. Gulotta said, he received a letter in which the union rejected the proposal and offered several alternative plans that he said were unacceptable. So he said he would move to withhold the pay of police officers anyway.</p>
        <p>''By lagging the P.B.A. members, we avoid any concern with regard to the reduction of police on the streets  or the reduction of safety on the streets,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. DelaRaba said imposing the lag payroll without the union's approval would violate the memorandum of agreement that he and other union leaders signed in December.</p>
