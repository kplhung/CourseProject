        <p>In his role of general manager, Bob Clarke has built the Philadelphia Flyers into a modern-day version of the Broad Street Bullies he led as a player a quarter-century ago.</p>
        <p>No one intended to create the pool of Sergei Nemchinov's blood that stained the ice early in the second period tonight. But there it was. And like some flashback to the game's rougher days, when the Flyers bullied their way to consecutive Stanley Cups, it coincided with a Flyers comeback.</p>
        <p>This comeback was short-lived. The Flyers are hoping that the message was not, not after the Devils held off Philadelphia, 4-1, to force the four-of-seven-game Eastern Conference finals back up the turnpike, for Game 6 Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>The biggest question for the remainder of the series is if Philadelphia's biggest bully will be allowed to return. Eric Lindros, who has not played since March 13 because of recurrent concussions, was cleared to practice starting today.</p>
        <p>But it was clear that Lindros, who was stripped of his captaincy on March 27, would not be unconditionally welcomed back.</p>
        <p>''We have to wait and see,'' said John LeClair, who has assumed more of a leadership role in Lindros's absence. ''We're not counting on anything. We just got done with a game. We haven't even thought of what could happen or what's going to take place.''</p>
        <p>What took place tonight was not pretty from Philadelphia's point of view. And once the Flyers fell behind by three goals, they briefly became more aggressive. As so many other teams have in the past, the Devils backed off.</p>
        <p>Nemchinov paid the biggest price 3 minutes 2 seconds into the second period, a minute and a half after the Devils took a 3-0 lead. It took 40 stitches to close the wound on the left side of his head, one more than it took to close a nasty cut on LeClair's face in Game 3.</p>
        <p>When asked if he had ever been involved in such a bloody series, LeClair -- his blue right eye half red and circled with yellow, purple, black and blue -- said no.</p>
        <p>LeClair was cut by an unintentional high stick by Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur. Nemchinov's injury resulted from a clean LeClair hit along the left boards, which displaced the glass in front of the Flyers' penalty box far enough to allow Nemchinov's face to meet a metal stanchion.</p>
        <p>The home crowd roared.</p>
        <p>Out came the shovels, the scrapers and the water bottles to clean the blood off the ice. Even if LeClair had not been seeking payback, he had exacted it. And for the rest of the period, the Flyers pounded the Devils into submission.</p>
        <p>Adam Burt buried Alexander Mogilny. So did Dan McGillis. LeClair elbowed his way past Scott Stevens at the Devils blue line. Suddenly, the Devils stopped doing everything that had allowed them to take the 3-0 lead.</p>
        <p>All the Flyers had to show for their aggression, however, was a 3-1 deficit heading into the third period.</p>
        <p>And when Patrik Elias scored just 54 seconds into the final period to restore the Devils' three-goal lead, they were headed for another home game.</p>
        <p>What remains to be seen is how they react to the intimidation.</p>
        <p>Every time Philadelphia has been in trouble in the playoffs, the bigger, badder Flyers have resorted to brawn. They picked a five-on-five fight with the skill-oriented Penguins in the final minute of an embarrassing 4-1 Game 2 loss to visiting Pittsburgh on April 29. After opening the series with two road victories, the Penguins did not win another game.</p>
        <p>Coincidence? The Flyers think not. Nor do their fans.</p>
        <p>In the waning moments of another embarrassing 4-1 home loss, to the Devils in Game 1 on May 14, the Philadelphia faithful sent their heroes a message. It came in the form of a bunch of rowdies in Flyers jerseys who beat up a pair of older fans in Devils jerseys.</p>
        <p>Security guards at First Union Center took a while to rescue the Devils fans.</p>
        <p>The home crowd roared.</p>
        <p>The Flyers responded two days later by initiating the hardest-hitting game of the postseason. Or rather, the Flyers' Keith Primeau initiated it by challenging the Devils' Randy McKay to a fight in Primeau's first game since suffering a concussion a week earlier.</p>
        <p>The home crowd roared.</p>
        <p>McGillis later cut Sergei Brylin. Primeau knocked John Madden out of the series with a knee-on-knee hit. The Flyers took that game and the next two. So when they fell behind by 3-0 early in the second period tonight, was it any wonder what the Flyers resorted to?</p>
        <p>''I think we play a certain style,'' Primeau said.</p>
        <p>Remember, Bob Clarke built this team in the image of his youth.</p>
