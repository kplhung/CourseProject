        <p>Although the Rangers might be Glen Sather's first choice as the next stop in his professional hockey career, they apparently are not his only choice.</p>
        <p>Sather acknowledged yesterday that he had a meeting with a team on Sunday and that he has one with another team later this week. The meeting this week will likely take place Thursday, with the Rangers, at Sather's La Quinta, Calif., home.</p>
        <p>The meeting Sunday was with a team that Sather would not identify. Among the possible candidates, according to a number of National Hockey League officials, were Calgary, Los Angeles, San Jose and Montreal.</p>
        <p>''I have some meetings planned all week,'' said Sather, who met with his former employees in the Oilers' organization in Edmonton, Alberta, yesterday. Sather resigned as the Oilers' president and general manager last Friday.</p>
        <p>Sather said he had asked Anders Hedberg to hold off from accepting the general manager position of the Swedish Ice Hockey Federation last week. After a week of waiting, Hedberg yesterday accepted the position through the 2002 world championships.</p>
        <p>''Glen and I have communicated a lot in the last week,'' Hedberg said from Stockholm yesterday. ''I have a pretty good belief he'll end up in an interesting spot wherever it may be. That's why I asked for the time out. There was the big possibility of New York. If Glen headed to New York, it would have been an interesting decision.''</p>

        <p>HAWKS NAME FINN AS NEW COACH: Alpo Suhonen of Finland has become the first European-born N.H.L. coach in 50 years, given the job of taking the Chicago Blackhawks back to the playoffs after a three-year absence. Suhonen, 51, has coached for nearly 30 years, first in Europe, then as an assistant in Winnipeg and Toronto.</p>
