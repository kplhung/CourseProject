        <p>A disciplinary committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court recommended today that President Clinton be disbarred because of his ''serious misconduct'' in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case.</p>
        <p>The court-appointed panel, the Arkansas Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct, concluded that Mr. Clinton should receive the severest sanction -- the loss of his state license to practice law -- for providing false testimony in 1998 about his relationship with Monica S.

        <p>A disciplinary committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court recommended today that President Clinton be disbarred because of his ''serious misconduct'' in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case.</p>
        <p>The court-appointed panel, the Arkansas Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct, concluded that Mr. Clinton should receive the severest sanction -- the loss of his state license to practice law -- for providing false testimony in 1998 about his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky.</p>
        <p>The testimony had been given in a lawsuit by Paula Corbin Jones that had accused Mr. Clinton of sexual misconduct while he was governor of Arkansas and she was a state employee.</p>
        <p>Under the committee rules, the disbarment recommendation will now be considered by a Pulaski County circuit court judge in Little Rock, Ark., who will oversee any disbarment proceedings.</p>
        <p>If the judge decides to disbar Mr. Clinton, who is a former Arkansas attorney general, the president can appeal the decision to the Arkansas Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said in an interview broadcast tonight that he would vigorously defend himself but that he would not participate in disbarment proceedings in Arkansas. The president said he had promised the American people after the impeachment trial ended that he would not ''personally involve'' himself in such matters until he left office.</p>
        <p>''It's not right,'' he said in an interview with NBC News.</p>
        <p>''The only reason I agreed even to appeal it is that my lawyers looked at all the precedents and they said there's no way in the world, if they just treat you like everybody else has been treated, that this is even close to that kind of case,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''So the precedents contradict this decision and ultimately the decision has to be made by a judge,'' he said. ''And so we're going to give the judge a chance to do what we believe is right, and I think that's the right thing to do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton argued earlier this month that his 20 years of public service should persuade the panel to be lenient and not recommend any sanction harsher than a reprimand.</p>
        <p>He also insisted again that he had not technically lied before a federal judge in the Jones case. The president maintained that his answers under oath denying a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky were technically accurate.</p>
        <p>Last year, Mr. Clinton was the first president to be held in contempt of court by a federal judge. The president could avoid the disbarment proceedings if he voluntarily surrendered his Arkansas law license, but his private lawyer, David E. Kendall, rejected that option today.</p>
        <p>''This recommendation is wrong and clearly contradicted by precedent,'' Mr. Kendall said. ''We will vigorously dispute it in a court of law.''</p>
        <p>The panel's decision moves Mr. Clinton, who is licensed to practice law only in Arkansas, one step closer to becoming the first president to be disbarred while in office. Richard M. Nixon was disbarred in July 1976 by the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court on charges of obstruction of justice connected with the Watergate scandal.</p>
        <p>The Arkansas panel's recommendation surprised some legal experts, who said it seemed harsh compared with similar cases in the state.</p>
        <p>Judith Kilpatrick, who teaches professional responsibility at the University of Arkansas Law School, said, ''I'm rather surprised, especially because this is a first offense and it did not involve something like stealing from clients.''</p>
        <p>The disciplinary committee imposes sanctions on as many as 100 lawyers a year. The panel usually recommends disbarment only in cases where a lawyer has stolen money from a client.</p>
        <p>However, in 1998, the State Supreme Court withheld a license from lawyer who had committed insurance fraud, saying ''there is simply no place in the law for a man or woman who will not tell the truth even when his interest is involved.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has not practiced law since the early 1980's, between his first and second terms as governor of Arkansas. And although he has said he does not intend to practice law upon leaving the White House, the president, a graduate of Yale Law School, has defended himself against the disciplinary proceedings.</p>
        <p>It is not clear what practical effect a disbarment would have on Mr. Clinton's career after he leaves the White House. Friends of the president have said they expected him to teach, write books and work on public policy issues. He could apply for entry to another state bar, legal experts say, but most states would take into account the disbarment in considering his application.</p>
        <p>A White House spokesman referred all questions to Mr. Kendall.</p>
        <p>The disbarment committee has 14 members. Six panelists heard the president's case on Friday. Five are lawyers and the sixth is a retired schoolteacher. Eight of the committee's panelists had recused themselves, most of them citing potential conflicts of interest because said they had business or personal relationships with the president.</p>
        <p>In a letter today to the Arkansas Supreme Court's clerk, James A. Neal, the executive director of the disciplinary panel, wrote that disbarment proceedings should begin ''against attorney William Jefferson Clinton.''</p>
        <p>A majority of the six members who voted had concluded ''that certain of the attorney's conduct as demonstrated in the complaints constituted serious misconduct in violation'' of two rules of the Arkansas Model Rules of Professional Conduct, wrote Mr. Neal, whose retirement from the panel was also announced today.</p>
        <p>The committee on Friday considered two complaints against the president, one filed by the Southeastern Legal Foundation, a conservative organization in Atlanta, and another by Judge Susan Webber Wright, the federal judge who presided over the case in which Ms. Jones accused Mr. Clinton of sexual misconduct.</p>
        <p>During a January 1998 deposition in that case, Mr. Clinton testified that he had not engaged in a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. The president argued that he told the truth during the Jones deposition, but  Judge Wright disagreed. On April 12, 1999, Judge Wright held the president in contempt of court, fined him $90,000 and referred the matter to the Arkansas bar committee for possible disciplinary proceedings.</p>
        <p>Judge Wright did not suggest a specific penalty. But the Southeastern Legal Foundation had sought Mr. Clinton's disbarment.</p>
        <p>''Today, the committee's decision sends a message to the American people that the rules which govern attorney conduct will be enforced,'' said Matthew J. Glavin, the president of the Southeastern Legal Foundation. ''This committee, under tremendous public and political pressure, has done its duty in issuing a serious sanction.''</p>
        <p>The president's lawyers had tried to put off the proceedings until Mr. Clinton left office, and they were surprised when the committee would not do so.</p>
        <p>In arguments earlier this month, the president's lawyers tried to again press Mr. Clinton's contention that he had been truthful in saying he did not have sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky because the type of sexual activity in which they engaged did not fit the definition of sexual relations that had been approved by Judge Wright in the Jones case.</p>
