        <p>The City University of New York trustees yesterday approved a plan offering a new vision for the university, with elite colleges and research groups, higher standards for admission and graduation and possibly a required core curriculum across campuses.</p>
        <p>The effort to reinvigorate CUNY is spelled out in a 133-page master plan that by the law the university must submit to the New York State Regents by next week. It would affect everything from the hiring of professors to testing requirements for students.</p>
        <p>CUNY officials hope the plan will rebuild the university's reputation after years of battering by critics, including Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and some of the university's own trustees, who charged that its standards were too low, that many students failed to graduate and that others who did graduate could not read or write English.</p>
        <p>Although some say the attacks were unjustified, the master plan does not debate the issue; it simply pledges to do better and adopts some of the recommendations made last June by Mayor Giuliani's advisory task force on CUNY.</p>
        <p>Among the programs called for in the master plan were the upgrading of teacher education, the creation of an honors college to attract the academically strongest students and an increase in the proportion of full-time faculty.</p>
        <p>Although long-range plans are sometimes lofty documents doomed to remain on a high shelf, the university's chancellor and the trustees are already working to turn this one into a reality, to the dismay of some critics. Most of the steps can be taken without permission from the Regents, although some, like the addition of new professors, will depend on increased financing by the city and the state.</p>
        <p>Added momentum comes from the fact that two top trustees -- the board's chairman, Herman Badillo, and its vice chairman, Benno C. Schmidt Jr. -- were on the Giuliani task force, and Mr. Schmidt was its chairman.</p>
        <p>CUNY has already begun to limit the number of students who enter some of its senior colleges and its teacher education programs by requiring higher grade point averages and test scores.</p>
        <p>It has also begun to forge partnerships with the city's schools chief and its business leaders. And the chancellor has started to reorganize his office and to develop a performance evaluation system for top administrators.</p>
        <p>''We have wonderful opportunities at this university to do some extraordinary things,'' the university's chancellor, Matthew Goldstein, told the trustees, adding that the master plan would help accomplish them.</p>
        <p>Critics of the plan, however, question whether CUNY can transform itself in this way and still retain its franchise as the city's public university, helping those with the greatest educational needs.</p>
        <p>These critics say that the university should have consulted more with its own faculty and students, and should not have embraced the Schmidt report so unquestioningly.</p>
        <p>''There is an overreliance on the Schmidt report, which has been critiqued and found wanting,'' said Bernard Sohmer, the faculty trustee, during a discussion of the plan at the board's committee on long-range planning earlier this month.</p>
        <p>Dr. Goldstein said yesterday that he planned to hold two more hearings on the plan on the mornings of June 15 and 16.</p>
        <p>The plan will also face hearings in Albany, said Assemblyman Edward C. Sullivan, a Democrat of Manhattan and the chairman of the State Assembly's higher education committee, who criticized the plan in a letter to the university's chairman that was released last week.</p>
        <p>''CUNY already has 'high standards,' is very 'effective' at what it does, and accounts very well for the dollars it spends,'' Mr. Sullivan wrote. The assemblyman said that by raising admissions standards and restricting admissions, the university was abandoning the students who need the most help and are most difficult to educate.</p>
        <p>''With your wordy and pious document, you are setting out to invent the light bulb,'' he wrote. ''But it is worse than that. You are purporting to 'raise standards' by simply abandoning difficult tasks.''</p>
        <p>In the master plan, the university says its goal is to raise average College Board scores for freshmen at its senior colleges by at least 30 points by 2003. It wants the average SAT scores at Queens College, for example, to reach 1,100 this fall and 1,130 by September 2003. (The national average is 1,016 out of a possible 1,600 points.)</p>
        <p>The master plan also raises the possibility that a basic required curriculum for all students, including American history, might be instituted at all CUNY campuses, as it has been at the State University of New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Badillo, CUNY's chairman, is a strong proponent of a common core curriculum across the university, including American history.</p>
        <p>''High school courses are very different from college courses,'' he said yesterday, explaining why all students should be required to take American history in college. ''College courses are not about dates; they are about concepts, how the basic ideas of American democracy came about.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Goldstein said that many of the university's 17 undergraduate colleges already have their own core courses and that he did not envision a common set of requirements at all of them.</p>
        <p>The master plan stopped short of recommending that a common basic curriculum be adopted, but called for the development of a ''common set of educational goals'' in the liberal arts. It said the chancellor would sponsor a universitywide forum on liberal education to discuss goals.</p>
        <p>''An important aspect of CUNY's reinvigoration is its consideration of what it is that constitutes a college education,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>A number of other steps were outlined in the four-year blueprint.</p>
        <p>*Introducing standardized tests to ensure that students are proficient in reading and writing.</p>
        <p>*Developing more first-class ''flagship programs'' to bolster CUNY's standing among research universities.</p>
        <p>*Working with New York City schools to ensure that students are better prepared by the time they enter the university.</p>
        <p>*Raising productivity and tightening financial management.</p>
        <p>*Increasing outside fund-raising.</p>
        <p>*Collaborating more closely with corporations and government agencies.</p>
        <p>CUNY also announced the appointment of a new university dean for teacher education, Nicholas M. Michelli, dean of the College of Education and Human Services at Montclair State University in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Dr. Michelli will work with the colleges to ensure that graduates who want to become teachers pass the teacher certification examinations and that their teacher education programs meet state standards.</p>
        <p>Education department officials have threatened to close some CUNY programs unless more of their graduates pass the certification exams.</p>
