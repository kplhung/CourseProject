        <p>Carver Bancorp, the Harlem institution that is the largest black-run bank in the country, announced yesterday that it had given up its struggle to keep two dissident shareholders off its board.</p>
        <p>In return, the dissidents, who are the owners of the Boston Bank of Commerce, have agreed to drop a lawsuit against Carver that was to have gone to trial last week. Carver will pay close to half a million dollars to help cover their legal costs and  will hold an election next March at which the insurgents can take control of the bank if they receive enough votes from other shareholders.</p>
        <p>The legal settlement is just the latest twist in the complex and bitter fight over the future of the Harlem bank, which has been trying to recover from financial problems. Carver lost money in its last fiscal year, and has been classified by regulators as a troubled institution; its stock price plunged from $17.50 in late 1997 to just under $8 yesterday.</p>
        <p>Only three months ago, Carver's executives swore that they could not tolerate having the Boston Bank officials, Kevin Cohee and Teri Williams, on the board. Deborah C. Wright, Carver's president, and David R. Jones, its chairman, have repeatedly said that the Boston bank is a competitor that has tried to take over Carver, and that the presence of Mr. Cohee and Ms. Williams on the board would be disruptive.</p>
        <p>Asked about the reversal, Ruth Pachman, a spokeswoman for Carver, said, ''Well, it's time to move on.''</p>
        <p>The settlement is by no means a truce. Robert Patrick Cooper, general counsel for the Boston bank, immediately protested Carver's decision to keep on its board Mr. Jones and David N. Dinkins, the former mayor. The dissidents contend that the two men were defeated by Mr. Cohee and Ms. Williams at an election held in February.</p>
        <p>After the election, Carver announced that Mr. Jones and Mr. Dinkins, who were incumbents, had won by about 30,000 votes out of the 1.7 million cast. But last month, a Delaware judge invalidated about 86,000 votes cast for the incumbents.</p>
        <p>In dropping its lawsuit, Boston Bank of Commerce, which is black-owned, has given up its fight to get Carver to revoke the sale of $2.5 million of preferred stock to two Wall Street firms allied with Ms. Wright. The deal, announced in January, gave Morgan Stanley and Provender Capital control of about 8 percent of Carver's common shares; Boston Bank owns 7.4 percent of Carver's common.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1948, Carver survived for decades as one of the few savings banks to serve minority neighborhoods, and its conservative management kept it going even through the savings and loan crisis of the 1980's. But the bank made few loans, angering customers as well as regulators.</p>
        <p>In recent years, it expanded into auto loans and credit cards, with bad results. A year ago, the board brought in Ms. Wright, the former president of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, to try to turn the bank around.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohee and his supporters have criticized Ms. Wright for her lack of banking experience; she and her supporters have, in turn, criticized the Boston bank as an interloper without the community ties that Carver needs.</p>
