        <p>Last Friday, Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, asked me during an interview about the Met's decision to cancel its Chanel exhibition, ''Does Jenny Holzer sound like a Chanel show to you?''</p>
        <p>I had to admit that Jenny Holzer did not sound like a Chanel show, and I told him she made me think of the designer Helmut Lang, with whom she has a well-known connection. Mr. de Montebello seemed pleased that this had been my response.</p>
        <p>Of course, what I think about Ms. Holzer or the appropriateness of her art or, indeed, Karl Lagerfeld's proposal to include it in the Chanel exhibition is immaterial. But the question Mr. de Montebello raised gives a clue to the role that self-doubt and bureaucratic second-guessing played in bringing an end to a show that had been planned for months, which would have opened on Dec. 6. If the director of the most powerful cultural institution in New York was asking a journalist what she thought, then he must have worked his way through a long list.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. de Montebello and Mr. Lagerfeld, Chanel's designer for two decades, differ in their interpretations of the facts leading up to the Met's decision, just about everyone involved in the exhibition, including Chanel executives and museum officials, agrees on one thing: a costume show devoted to Coco Chanel should have been a no-brainer. She is probably the greatest fashion designer of the 20th century, the first to grasp that the modern ideal was a well-dressed woman who didn't appear to care about fashion. Virtually every style that Chanel gave rise to, from the little black dress to the casual cardigan suits that revived her career in the late 1950's, conveyed that ideal. That Chanel was also a paradox -- a modernist who liberated the female body, yet who was herself a kept woman -- just made her all the more worthy of a first-rate show.</p>
        <p>From the outset, Mr. Lagerfeld didn't want a conventional show, with mannequins stuck behind glass cases. Nor, it seems, did Mr. de Montebello, who said last week, ''I joyfully accepted Karl's ideas.'' The fact that the Met wanted to stage the exhibition in the upstairs Cantor Galleries, rather than in the subterranean Costume Institute, meant that Mr. Lagerfeld would have a more conducive space for his ideas. It was his plan, he said in an interview, to combine Chanel's clothes with sculptures and paintings by contemporary artists -- in effect, to bring out the modernist spirit in which Chanel lived and move the exhibition away from a display of old clothes.</p>
        <p>In the absence of a strong curatorial presence in fashion at the Met (since the death of Richard Martin last November, the museum has relied on interim costume curators), Mr. Lagerfeld's vision not only prevailed, said people who attended a planning meeting last month, but also seemed to be enthusiastically endorsed by Mr. de Montebello.</p>
        <p>Even so, signs of mistrust were developing on both sides. One can imagine how someone of Mr. Lagerfeld's verbal acuity might have little patience for people not up to his speed, or as alert to Chanel cliches. He said that when someone proposed replicating the famous Chanel stairway in Paris, he replied, ''Is this an in-store promotion or are we doing 'Auntie Mame'?'' He was equally dubious, he said, when an interim curator suggested that Chanel was Every Woman.</p>
        <p>''I'm sorry,'' Mr. Lagerfeld told me, ''but I'm afraid every woman cannot be Coco Chanel.''</p>
        <p>The show hit an impasse toward the end of April, when Mr. Lagerfeld received a call in Paris from the museum's director, saying there could be no art in it. Though Mr. Lagerfeld came back with a proposal for video artists, he was reluctant to go forward, he said, until he had a written commitment from Mr. de Montebello. But it never came.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Montebello said that all museum exhibitions are a process, and that as he and members of his staff began to look at the show in real terms, it was clear to them that it wouldn't work. He spoke persuasively about curatorial control, and certainly he is right to be cautious. But in fact, at the Met and the Costume Institute, that ship has already left the harbor. One has only to mention the names of previous fashion houses that were the subjects of exhibitions and helped pay for them and influenced their content: Dior, Saint Laurent and Versace.</p>
        <p>The real loser in all this is the public. Perhaps it will be cheered by the possibility, now being bandied about, that the next costume show may be devoted to Jacqueline Kennedy in her White House years. A Met spokesman would neither confirm nor deny this.</p>
        <p>But talk about old clothes.</p>
