        <p>Reducing medical costs has become a major goal in the age of managed care, but a new study finds that can be trickier to accomplish than it may seem.</p>
        <p>One of the main ways to reduce costs is by shortening as much as possible the amount of time people are hospitalized. They are now told to come in as close to surgery as possible, for example, and discharged far earlier than was the practice in the past.</p>
        <p>When surgeons at the Boston University School of Medicine took a look at the savings associated with the early discharge of patients who had had heart bypass surgery, they found that in many cases the medical costs were simply shifted elsewhere, including to nursing services in the home or extended-care facilities. And in some cases, when problems arose, the patients had to be quickly readmitted to hospitals.</p>
        <p>The findings were presented earlier this month by Dr. Harold Lazar, a cardiothoracic surgeon, at a meeting of the American Association for Thoracic Surgery.</p>
        <p>According to the university, researchers compared bypass patients from 1990 with those from 1998, when patients spent an average of 3.8 fewer days in the hospital.</p>
