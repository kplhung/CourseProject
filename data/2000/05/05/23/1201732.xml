        <p>When a carpenter was charged two years ago in the first murder case on remote Shelter Island, the police said he had killed a longtime friend in anger, believing that the friend had molested an 8-year-old girl and had bragged that he would get away with it.</p>
        <p>But today, during opening statements in the murder trial, the defense said that the carpenter, Kenneth H. Payne, had been motivated not by anger, but by fear.</p>
        <p>Mr. Payne was afraid that his friend and neighbor, Curtis Cook, was planning to kill him and then molest Mr. Payne's 11-year-old daughter, Sara, and injure other members of his family, said the defense lawyer, Stephen J. Wilutis.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Payne believed that he and his family were in imminent danger and that he had to act immediately to protect his family and loved ones,''  Mr. Wilutis told the jury this morning in Suffolk County Criminal Court here. ''He did not act in anger. He believed he was between a rock and a hard place. You will see from the evidence that he was justified.''</p>
        <p>But opening for the prosecution, Christopher Clayton, an assistant Suffolk County district attorney, said that Mr. Payne acted deliberately and in anger when he picked up a shotgun on the night of April 27, 1998, and fatally shot Mr. Curtis, his friend for 20 years.</p>
        <p>The murder case is the first in the 300-year history of Shelter Island, a quaint, peaceful community between the North and South Forks on the eastern tip of Long Island. Its year-round population numbers less than 3,000, and swells to more than 10,000 during the summer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clayton, the prosecutor, told the jury today that Mr. Payne's actions had shown ''a depraved indifference for human life.'' The defendant, he said, had been drinking and was ''in an agitated state'' when he picked up his 12-gauge shotgun, loaded it with two cartridges and walked  from his trailer to Mr. Cook's house next door.</p>
        <p>''When Mr. Cook answered the door, Mr. Payne shot him at point-blank range, shattering his spine and sending lead fragments throughout his body,'' Mr. Clayton said. ''Mr. Cook was murdered in the doorway of his home. He was unarmed. All he had was a cigarette in his hand.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Payne, he said, ''then returned to his trailer, called his friends and told them what he had done.'' He said Mr. Payne signed a written confession at Shelter Island police headquarters, and also made a videotaped confession.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilutis, the defense lawyer,  said the tape would prove to be the most important piece of evidence in the case. ''He tells in his own words what happened, and how he believed that he faced an immediate threat to his life and the safety of his daughter.</p>
        <p>''This was simply a case of self-defense and defense of his family,''  Mr. Wilutis added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Payne, 44, who faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder, sat motionless and expressionless at the defense table during the opening statements  before Judge John Mullin. Mr. Payne is being held in $500,000 bond in the Suffolk County jail.</p>
        <p>The first witness called to the stand was Thomas Cronin, a Shelter Island police officer who was the first to arrive at the scene of the shooting. He recalled that he was in his patrol car when he heard a report over his radio that shots had been fired at 35 South Ferry Road where Mr. Cook, 44, lived alone in a small house behind a gas station.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cook, like Mr. Payne, was a self-employed handyman. His wife had died two years earlier, and at one point, despondent over her death, he had considered suicide. But Mr. Payne talked him out of it.</p>
        <p>Five weeks before the shooting, Mr. Cook was arrested on charges that he sodomized and sexually abused an 8-year-old girl.</p>
        <p>Both sides in the case say that in Mr. Payne's confessions, he said he had initially believed Mr. Cook's protestations of innocence, but began to doubt his friend after Mr. Cook bragged that for a fee of $70,000, a lawyer he had hired to defend him on the child abuse charges could ''get him off anything.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Payne told the police that when he returned home from a bar  around 9:15 on the night of the shooting, he found a message from Mr. Cook on his answering machine in which he bragged again about the abuse case. Lawyers for both the defense and the prosecution said the phone message would be played for  jurors.</p>
        <p>''Curtis sounded drunk and real happy,'' Mr. Payne said in his written confession, which the defense has released. ''I felt at that moment Curtis had to be stopped. I then went to my gun rack. I took my 12-gauge Marlin Slugmaster off the rack and made the gun ready to fire.''</p>
        <p>His lawyer, Mr. Wilutis, said today that the written confession, which he said was drawn up by the police and signed by Mr. Payne, did not indicate a clear motive. But, Mr. Wilutis said, that motive -- self-defense -- would be clear to the jurors when they viewed the videotaped confession.</p>
        <p>Mr. Payne, who has three children and is separated from his wife, said in the written confession that he walked next door to Mr. Cook's house and, when Mr. Cook opened the door, ''shot him just below his heart.''</p>
