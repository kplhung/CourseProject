        <p>Negotiations for a new labor agreement between Major League Baseball and the new umpires union have proceeded quietly, but the low-key tenor of the talks does not mean all is proceeding smoothly.</p>
        <p>A release issued by the union, the World Umpires Association, yesterday said the two sides have made significant progress in some areas but also said substantial differences remain on some very important issues.</p>
        <p>''The World Umpires Association is determined to protect the independence of the umpires, which is essential to baseball,'' John  Hirschbeck, the union president, said. He did not elaborate, but pay and matters of discipline and termination are issues that have not been resolved in the talks. The umpires apparently seek a pay scale patterned after a new agreement between the National Basketball Association and its referees, but the agreement gives the N.B.A. greater control in managing its officials than the umpires want to grant.</p>
        <p>Baseball officials gave the umpires' negotiators a new proposal last Friday, and the union is expected to respond at a session in Manhattan today.</p>
        <p>Negotiators reached an interim agreement two months ago under which umpires from the two leagues would be merged into one staff and work games in both leagues. In return for that agreement, baseball agreed that any salary increase the umpires receive would be retroactive.</p>
        <p>The two sides also agreed that there would be no work stoppage, strike or lockout, before mid-June. Neither side can act before May 31, and then if one wants to take some kind of action, it has to give 14 days notice.</p>
