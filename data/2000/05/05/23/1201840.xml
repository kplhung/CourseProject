        <p>A fierce debate erupted on the floor of the State Assembly today, as Democrats who control the chamber engaged in a rare public struggle over the future of their leader, Speaker Sheldon Silver.</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Silver and his allies beat back a coup attempt, as was widely expected. But the leaders of the insurrection may have accomplished something nearly as remarkable as toppling a sitting speaker: wounding him politically.</p>
        <p>The coup attempt provided a remarkable display of defiance that is nearly unheard of here in the Capitol, where the leaders of both houses decide matters behind closed doors, with debate over substantive issues rarely making it to the floor of the Assembly or Senate.</p>
        <p>The fight made for high political drama, with the 98 Democrats who make up the majority in the Assembly turning on one another in a clash that drew scores of people into the chamber's normally empty gallery.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver, for his part, never emerged from his office to defend himself on the floor, reinforcing the widespread image of him as isolated and aloof.</p>
        <p>The showdown had been building since late last week when Michael J. Bragman, an assemblyman from the Syracuse area, announced that he would try to overthrow Mr. Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan, in a vote. Mr. Silver immediately stripped Mr. Bragman of his title as majority leader.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman took his fight to the chamber late this afternoon even after he had publicly acknowledged that his base of support had dwindled in recent days as Mr. Silver rallied his own troops, punished disloyal lawmakers and threatened retaliation against any other legislator who crossed him.</p>
        <p>On the floor, Mr. Bragman accused Mr. Silver of hoarding power and keeping lawmakers in the dark about crucial decisions. He said that Mr. Silver had stifled debate on major issues, reduced rank-and-file lawmakers to bit players and given powerful lobbyists too much say in the day-to-day affairs of the chamber.</p>
        <p>''The truth is that we have to change the way this house conducts itself,'' Mr. Bragman said as a crowd of spectators sat mesmerized by the events unfolding on the floor.</p>
        <p>''Everyone here has felt the frustration and dissatisfaction with the current situation,'' he said. ''I know that better than anyone else, because virtually everyone in the majority conference has come to me, looked me in the eye, and expressed his or her dissatisfaction.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''Member after member is forced to go to the speaker to ask for anything, from paper clips to chairmanships, from parking passes to staff needs. And they have told me that they feel that their requests are being kept in a favor bank. Either you do what the speaker wants, or you don't get the things you need.''</p>
        <p>James F. Brennan, an assemblyman from Brooklyn, shared that sentiment, calling Mr. Silver's leadership ''a virtual dictatorship.'' He added that there is ''a sense of anger and frustration and bitterness about how the current administration conducts itself.''</p>
        <p>But lawmakers loyal to Mr. Silver struck back, accusing Mr. Bragman and his allies of severely weakening Democrats both in their dealing with Republicans over legislation and in this fall's elections.</p>
        <p>''We've won our battles through this speaker,'' said Richard L. Brodsky, an assemblyman from Westchester. ''We have kept our majority through this speaker.'' Then, jabbing his finger at Mr. Bragman, who was sitting just a few feet from him, he said: ''If there's to be healing and progress, this is not the vehicle and this is not the man.''</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Silver prevailed in an 85-to-63 vote that rejected a motion to suspend the normal rules of the Assembly in order to elect a new speaker. Mr. Silver received support from seven Nassau County Republicans.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bragman remained defiant, vowing to form an opposition bloc that promises to shadow the speaker's every move and weaken his authority. Mr. Bragman has the support of roughly 20 Democrats, who joined him at a news conference earlier in the day to air their grievances against Mr. Silver.</p>
        <p>''This is far from over,'' Mr. Bragman said after the vote. ''This is something that is not going to go away. My guess is that we are more united than we were before.''</p>
        <p>His comments potentially open up a new front in his struggle with Mr. Silver and raise questions about whether Mr. Silver can rule the chamber as firmly as he now does. Mr. Silver needs a sizable majority to control legislation in the Assembly, and Mr. Bragman poses a huge threat to his ability to do so.</p>
        <p>The sudden turn of events also raised a tantalizing prospect for Gov. George E. Pataki and his Republican allies in the Legislature, who have been trying to chip away at decades of Democratic control in the Assembly, particularly since Mr. Pataki took office in 1995.</p>
        <p>The Bragman camp represents a potential ally for Republicans, who during Mr. Pataki's first term tried to pressure individual Democrats to break ranks with Mr. Silver and support the governor's drive to enact tax cuts, toughen criminal penalties and reduce government spending.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver's allies concede that the speaker is not all that open or even friendly. But they contend that he runs a far more democratic house than his critics charge. They say that all major decisions are discussed by Democrats in closed-door meetings, where the strategy for the entire majority is hammered out.</p>
        <p>They also say that Mr. Silver never forces members to cast votes that go against their consciences on issues like abortion or the death penalty. More than that, they say, Mr. Silver has done an excellent job of reaching consensus in an unwieldy and ideologically diverse conference of 98 Democrats with strongly competing interests.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman is one of the few members in the Assembly who is in the position to mount a strong challenge to the speaker because of the broad-based support he has developed with conservatives, moderates and liberals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver has worked furiously to stop Mr. Bragman since he announced his plans to topple the speaker on Wednesday. Mr. Silver also demoted two high-ranking lawmakers who openly sided with Mr. Bragman, and he called on powerful union leaders and party officials to discourage any other Democrats in the Assembly from joining him. Mr. Silver also made it clear that he would punish any member who defied him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman referred to Mr. Silver's response during his comments on the floor today, calling them heavy handed. He said many more lawmakers would have joined his effort had they ''not feared reprisals, as was evident in recent days.''</p>
