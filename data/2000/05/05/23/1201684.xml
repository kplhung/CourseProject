        <p>When Dawn Upshaw sings popular songs, she instinctively cleans them up. Without actually editing lyrics, she has a way of taking messy emotions, straightening them out and tucking them in like freshly ironed sheets with hospital corners. Ms. Upshaw can read the subtext of a lyric as clearly as anyone. What she doesn't do is turn songs into turbulent personal dramas brimming with sex and heartbreak. Everything is filtered through a wholesome, practical sensibility that grasps both sides of a situation. Even when singing a sad song sadly, Ms. Upshaw conveys her delighted appreciation of its craft.</p>
        <p>In her 70-minute staged concert, ''Roundabout,'' which had performances on Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday at the John Jay College Theater, Ms. Upshaw offered a transcendently balanced tilting-toward-sunny overview of nearly two dozen songs by everyone from George and Ira Gershwin to Laura Nyro. The third part of Lincoln Center's three-part ''Images of Dawn'' project, the show, directed by Michael Mayer and featuring the baritone Greg Edelman, sustained a tone of demure elegance. Eric Stern, who conducted a chamber sextet, arranged the music, and his spare, gently wistful arrangements complemented Ms. Upshaw's crisp, no-frills performances.</p>

        <p>When Dawn Upshaw sings popular songs, she instinctively cleans them up.

Ms. Upshaw can read the subtext of a lyric as clearly as anyone. What she doesn't do is turn songs into turbulent personal dramas brimming with sex and heartbreak.

        <p>In her 70-minute staged concert, ''Roundabout,'' which had performances on Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday at the John Jay College Theater, Ms. Upshaw offered a transcendently balanced tilting-toward-sunny overview of nearly two dozen songs by everyone from George and Ira Gershwin to Laura Nyro. The third part of Lincoln Center's three-part ''Images of Dawn'' project, the show, directed by Michael Mayer and featuring the baritone Greg Edelman, sustained a tone of demure elegance. Eric Stern, who conducted a chamber sextet, arranged the music, and his spare, gently wistful arrangements complemented Ms. Upshaw's crisp, no-frills performances.</p>
        <p>The songs, beginning with a Paul Simon fragment from the album ''Bookends,'' were arranged to tell the story of one woman's ups and downs in the ''roundabout'' search for a lasting relationship. The show is not the first to take pre-existing songs and weave them into a semblance of a story. But except for one strained moment (done in silhouette) in which a woman pulls a gun on her lover, the show steered away from melodrama to present the songs as a series of mood swings in which Ms. Upshaw embodied an everywoman and Mr. Edelman a man (or men) entering and leaving her life.</p>
        <p>Ms. Upshaw stretched stylistically in ways she has not on her two Nonesuch albums of theater songs. Her version of the Lambert, Hendricks and Ross jazz classic ''Twisted'' swung lightly and deliciously. A relatively recent folk-pop song, Suzanne Vega's ''Tom's Diner,'' proved a perfect match for Ms. Upshaw's plain approach. Ms. Upshaw fared especially well with two Marc Blitzstein songs, and Mr. Edelman had his brightest moment with a psychologically insightfully penetrating version of Stephen Sondheim's ''God-Why-Don't-You-Love-Me Blues'' from ''Follies.''</p>
        <p>The only song to elude Ms. Upshaw at Saturday's performance was Mr. Sondheim's sultry parody ''Girls of Summer,'' whose suggestive dips and scoops (the vocal equivalent of bumps and grinds or a plunging neckline) Ms. Upshaw played down.</p>
        <p>The show featured a curved, two-layered backdrop (by David Gallo) with living room furniture. At crucial moments, slide projections (designed by Jan Hartley), including some haunting scenes of New York City in the 1940's and 50's, turned the stage into a wraparound urban environment.</p>
