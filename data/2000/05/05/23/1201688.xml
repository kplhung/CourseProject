        <p>Somewhere behind the heaps of percussion instruments on the stage of Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday evening lurked an orchestra. Not that it could be much heard over the din of Askell Masson's Concert Piece for Snare Drum and Orchestra, or seen in Stravinsky's ''Symphonies of Wind Instruments.''</p>
        <p>This was, after all, a subscription concert of the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Leonard Slatkin and to be repeated tonight, however much the first half turned the spotlight on a guest artist, the brilliant percussionist Evelyn Glennie. Ms. Glennie gave a hair-trigger account of the clamorous work by Mr. Masson, an Icelander, remarkably finding oases of subtlety. Then she played the New York premiere of Michael Daugherty's ''U.F.O.,'' a concerto written for her and the National Symphony last year.</p>

        <p>Somewhere behind the heaps of percussion instruments on the stage of Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday evening lurked an orchestra. Not that it could be much heard over the din of Askell Masson's Concert Piece for Snare Drum and Orchestra, or seen in Stravinsky's ''Symphonies of Wind Instruments.''</p>
        <p>This was, after all, a subscription concert of the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Leonard Slatkin and to be repeated tonight, however much the first half turned the spotlight on a guest artist, the brilliant percussionist Evelyn Glennie. Ms. Glennie gave a hair-trigger account of the clamorous work by Mr. Masson, an Icelander, remarkably finding oases of subtlety. Then she played the New York premiere of Michael Daugherty's ''U.F.O.,'' a concerto written for her and the National Symphony last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daugherty, who teaches composition at the University of Michigan, has tended to fall back on gimmicky pop subjects like Superman and Elvis Presley to ephemeral effect.</p>
        <p>But here, in a work that transcended the circus trappings, he captured Ms. Glennie's ebullient personality -- spontaneous and improvisational, theatrical as well as musical -- in its teeming fullness.</p>
        <p>Ms. Glennie entered from the rear of the auditorium, performing eerie ''Traveling Music.'' The other movements, ''Unidentified,'' ''Flying,'' ''???'' and ''Objects,'' leaned more toward the visceral and colorful. Only the lyrical ''Flying'' outwore its welcome: a shame, because it had some of the loveliest music.</p>
        <p>For the orchestra's turn in the sun, Mr. Slatkin offered Schumann's ''Rhenish'' Symphony, as edited by Gustav Mahler, or so the program said. It was a nice idea, since the first performance of the edition was given by the Philharmonic, in 1911 with Mahler himself conducting.</p>
        <p>Michael Steinberg, in a typically excellent essay, pointed to the edition's most salient feature: the dynamics at the start of the finale. But Mr. Slatkin, in a helpful demonstration of some of Mahler's changes from the stage, explained that he was ignoring that one and others.</p>
        <p>So what was Schumann? Mahler? Slatkin? It hardly mattered, given the general turgidity of the playing. The brasses (horns pointedly excluded), cut through the murk at times.</p>
        <p>The brasses had fine moments in the Stravinsky, too, though how that piece found itself wedged between those extroverted blasts of percussion was a mystery. The composer's lapidarian Neo-Classicism has never sounded more squinty-eyed.</p>
