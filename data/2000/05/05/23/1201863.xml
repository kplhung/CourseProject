        <p>BLOCH-Ephraim F. Age 85. Died in Palm Beach, FL. May 21, 2000. Extraordinarly beloved father of Michelle B. Bloch. Beloved father of Lawrence C. Bloch. Beloved of Joyce Cutty Bloch. Also survived by his son-in-law John Cuseo, his grandchildren Harry Franklin, Maggie Rose and Aaron Michael Bloch, sister Edna Bolno and brother-in-law Charles Bolno. Brother of the late Harry, Albert and Deborah. Benefactor and godfather of his many nieces and nephews. Ephraim was the Founder and CEO of Perfect Fit Industries. He was the greatest and most prolific inventor and marketer in the history of the domestics industry. His most notable accomplishment was the Bed Sack which achieved national fame. He was an accomplished pioneer. He was a substantial contributor to many charities, always in a self-effacing, quiet way. He helped many, many people in a like manner. He had an abundance of hidden warmth, plus a plethora of brains, knowledge and sense of humor. Ephraim, you paid for the last drink. This one is on me. There aren't any doctors in the land beyond the sky, only bartenders, so ask for a double. Rest in peace, you more than deserve it. Alvin L. Levine</p>
        <p>BLOCH-Ephraim. The AntiDefamation League mourns the passing of a great friend and supporter, Ephraim Bloch. He was a stalwart of the ADL Palm Beach community. His participation, leadership and commitment to ADL events, issues and programs was always of special importance. We will miss Ephraim's wisdom, graciousness, generosity and deep devotion. Our hearts go out to his family. Howard P. Berkowitz, National Chairman Abraham H. Foxman, National Director</p>
        <p>BLOCH-Ephraim F. Sincere condolences to his entire family and friends. He was regarded as an innovator and leader in the home textiles industry. He completely changed the character of the industry in 1976 when he created the Bedsack Bedclothing. No longer drab and boring. He will always be remembered and missed. John T. Hunter, Friend</p>
