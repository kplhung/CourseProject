        <p>The center of Israel's buffer zone in southern Lebanon has abruptly collapsed, after the Israeli-backed Lebanese militia abandoned villages, command posts and arms to advancing Hezbollah guerrillas, and the Israeli Army early today hurriedly evacuated a major Lebanese base.</p>
        <p>Israeli television showed Hezbollah followers triumphantly raising their Kalashnikov-emblazoned yellow flags on Monday atop heavily fortified command posts, some barely a mile from Israeli settlements, that Israel had turned over to its militia allies only days earlier.</p>
        <p>That handover was part of an ongoing Israeli pullback leading up to a full withdrawal by July 7, a deadline set by Prime Minister Ehud Barak.</p>
        <p>Before dawn today, the Israeli Army began evacuating troops and weapons from Bint Jebeil, its second-largest base in the Lebanese border buffer zone.</p>
        <p>Dozens of Israeli buses arrived at border crossing points, prepared to transport what Army officials said could be as many as 1,000 fleeing South Lebanon Army fighters and family members to a makeshift refugee camp inside Israel.</p>
        <p>For the last two decades, Israeli troops have occupied an 11-mile-deep zone inside Lebanon, fighting alongside the 2,500-member, Israeli-equipped South Lebanon Army.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Israeli warplanes repeatedly bombed Hezbollah fighters and followers moving into the border zone, killing six civilians and wounding dozens, according to Lebanese officials. Fearing Hezbollah reprisals, the Israeli Army ordered Israeli frontier residents into bomb shelters, but hundreds chose instead to leave their homes and drive far out of range of Katyusha rockets.</p>
        <p>Tanks and troops rushed from deep inside Israel to reinforce outposts on the Israeli side of the border on Monday night, with pressure mounting on Mr. Barak to pull the remaining troops in Lebanon back into Israel as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>Israel had hoped for an orderly, staged withdrawal, with United Nations troops replacing the Israeli Army in the southern border zone. But with the United Nations still debating whether to expand and redeploy its 4,500-member peacekeeping force in Lebanon, and Hezbollah suddenly in control of the central section of the border zone, such a scenario is no longer possible. ''We did not expect the withdrawal to be completely without dangers or difficult moments,'' Mr. Barak said on Monday night as he called an emergency meeting of his security cabinet. ''There have been such moments, and there will be more in the future.''</p>
        <p>At the meeting, which continued late into the night, the participants agreed to speed up the withdrawal, according to reports on Israeli radio.</p>
        <p>In southern Lebanon, hundreds of Muslim villagers walked and drove past abandoned Israeli Army checkpoints on Monday, after they were apparently left without a fight, to occupy the border district.</p>
        <p>The South Lebanon Army began quickly disintegrating on its own on Monday, abandoning military posts and equipment throughout the central swath of the border region.</p>
        <p>Scores of panicked militiamen and family members fled into Israel, which promised to provide at least temporary refuge to its Lebanese allies. Many more surrendered to the forces of Hezbollah, or the Party of God, which seized six command posts and a dozen villages that had long been under the control of Israel and the South Lebanon Army.</p>
        <p>For Israelis watching the televised images of the suddenly transformed border zone, it was the beginning of the end of a costly occupation that began with the invasion of Lebanon 25 years ago, and was soon institutionalized with the creation of a border ''security zone'' patrolled by Israel and its militia partners. Though opinion polls show that Israelis overwhelmingly support Mr. Barak's planned withdrawal, those images -- and the prospect of further fighting -- have proved deeply unsettling.</p>
        <p>After meeting with army commanders on the Israeli side of the border on Monday, Mr. Barak reiterated his pledge to pull all Israeli forces out of southern Lebanon within ''a few weeks.'' His office denied Israeli television reports that he had ordered the troops withdrawn by June 1, five weeks ahead of his original deadline.</p>
        <p>But in light of the Monday collapse of at least two battalions of the South Lebanon Army, the security cabinet  was said to be trying to speed up the withdrawal, while reinforcing Israeli military installations immediately south of the border.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak said he could not promise border residents that they would be out of danger soon.</p>
        <p>All along the border, meanwhile, Israeli Army trucks continued to haul arms and other equipment out of Lebanon, while private Israeli crews erected electrified fences. It was unclear how many Israeli soldiers remain in Lebanese territory.</p>
        <p>In a message aimed at both Beirut and Damascus -- as well as at an increasingly nervous Israeli public -- Mr. Barak warned on Monday that forces across the border ''should not test our resolve by daring to fire at Israeli soldiers, and much less at northern border communities'' during the withdrawal.</p>
        <p>''The response will be painful, and not necessarily here in the villages across from us: not Ramle, not Qawzah, not Alma al Shaab and Aita al Shaab,'' he said, citing nearby Lebanese towns often used by Hezbollah artillery units. ''It will be in completely different places, and very painful.''</p>
        <p>Yet the South Lebanon Army's desperate scramble out of Israel's shrinking security zone and the threat of rocket attacks on northern communities have increased Israeli  fears that the withdrawal could set off a new round of intense cross-border warfare.</p>
        <p>Since Sunday night, Hezbollah forces have secured control of most of the former Israeli command posts in the central border region.</p>
        <p>Israeli planes on Monday bombed Israeli tanks, artillery and armored personnel carriers that the South Lebanon Army had abandoned at the posts, in order to keep them from falling into Hezbollah hands, the Israeli military said.</p>
        <p>The Israeli opposition, calling for a special session of Parliament on Tuesday to debate the withdrawal,  fiercely criticized the border chaos on Monday as an indictment of Mr. Barak's plan to withdraw from Lebanon even without securing a peace settlement with Syria, Hezbollah's  prime protector.</p>
        <p>''We must not unilaterally withdraw without first establishing quiet in southern Lebanon,'' said Ariel Sharon, the head of the opposition Likud Party, who led Israel's invasion of Lebanon a quarter-century ago. ''That is the first thing that must be done. Unfortunately, the prime minister can't stand the pressure.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak's party responded in a tart statement, saying the prime minister ''has no need for advice on Lebanon from Sharon, who was disqualified from serving as defense minister in the wake of his mishaps in Lebanon.''</p>
        <p>The Lebanese withdrawal crisis completely overshadowed the suspension of peace talks with the Palestinians as Palestinian security forces kept control of continued demonstrations on Monday demanding the release of Palestinians in Israeli jails.</p>
        <p>Most of the South Lebanon Army troops who surrendered their positions on Monday belonged to the Shiite minority faction of the militia, and are considered less resolutely opposed to Hezbollah than the Christian and Druse troops still manning outposts to the east and west. Despite the collapse of the South Lebanon Army's central front, Antoine Lahad, the self-styled general who commands the militia, was quoted on Monday as saying that his forces would fight on unless granted a blanket amnesty by Lebanon.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 24, 2000, Wednesday  A front-page article yesterday about the collapse of the Israeli buffer zone in southern Lebanon misstated the timing of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon led by Ariel Sharon, who now heads the opposition Likud Party and who criticized Israel's current withdrawal. The invasion occurred in 1982, not a quarter-century ago.</p>
