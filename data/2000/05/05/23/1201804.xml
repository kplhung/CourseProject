        <p>In signs of an intensifying digital rush in the American book industry, three trade publishing giants and Microsoft are poised to plunge deeper into the emerging electronic literary market.</p>
        <p>Time Warner Trade Publishing, a unit of Time Warner, is expected to announce today the creation of a separate online publishing venture called iPublish.com and iWrite, an unconventional hybrid that will solicit manuscripts from would-be authors for review for electronic publication.</p>
        <p>And in a dueling morning news conference, Microsoft -- along with Simon &amp; Schuster, a unit of Viacom and Random House, a unit of Bertelsmann -- will detail the giveaway of electronic versions of Michael Crichton's most recent book, the thriller ''Timeline,'' along with agreements to publish more than a dozen Star Trek titles in electronic form readable only on Microsoft's new reader software for hand-held and personal computers.</p>
        <p>The frantic pace of developments indicates that the industry is fast reaching a critical mass in its embrace of technology that could reshape the market, although skeptics still argue that electronic books are at least two years away from gaining widespread popularity.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's alliance with two of the nation's top trade publishers is the company's first successful deal to obtain popular new titles for its software, which has thus far had little to offer readers except older public domain titles and fairy tales. And over the next three weeks, a person close to Microsoft said, there will be more such announcements.</p>
        <p>But today, Microsoft executives will introduce their first marquee author, Mr. Crichton, who will try to pick up where his fellow best-selling writer Stephen King left off in March, when copies of his electronic novella, ''Riding the Bullet,'' ignited a two-day burst of 400,000 orders that overwhelmed booksellers like Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com.</p>
        <p>Fittingly, ''Timeline'' is a story about historians employed by a technology billionaire not unlike Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates. In the fictional realm, the entrepreneur wants to build a theme park with ancient artifacts, so historians are dispatched through time travel to feudal France, where they confront the thrills and chills of swordplay and pitch-filled catapults.</p>
        <p>In the evolving world of electronic publishing, the chills come from lowly competitors, who are challenging large mainstream publishers to take new risks.</p>
        <p>''The large conglomerates realize now that they better learn by doing rather than to continue to observe not one, not 5, not 50, but hundreds of startup.coms that are entering this market,'' said Robert E. Baensch, a former publishing executive and director of New York University's Center for Publishing, who predicts that a mass market for electronic books is two to three years away.</p>
        <p>But until then, the mainstream publishers that dominate the business appear unwilling to wait -- even if it is not clear yet how protected the electronic titles are from hackers. It took about two days before Mr. King's novella was successfully hacked and posted online.</p>
        <p>One executive in the electronic book industry said that talks were already under way with Microsoft and other software and device manufacturers to try to resolve the issue.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Time Warner's start-up, iPublish, is already considering ways to experiment with the very form of the book. A top Time Warner corporate executive said it would probably publish short offerings of digital nonfiction and fiction from established authors like David Baldacci and Walter Mosley.</p>
        <p>With a staff of 15 employees who started last fall, the new electronic publisher will also offer condensed versions of print books. Serial books are also in the offing and will be priced by installment.</p>
        <p>Those new titles -- along with older digital books from Time Warner -- will start becoming available next fall. The works will be available for reading with Microsoft software and will also be available to rivals including Gemstar's Rocket eBooks, SoftBook Readers and NetLibrary's Peanut Press versions for Palm hand-held devices.</p>
        <p>The Time Warner executive said the company was also creating another more unconventional publishing arm, iWrite, which will seek manuscripts from any would-be author. The new company is similar in nature to Xlibris, a Philadelphia-based Internet start-up that recently sold a 49 percent stake to Random House. Xlibris also solicits work from any writer but charges fees for editing and review.</p>
        <p>IWrite will not charge editing fees, the executive said, and the company will hire people to read the material, much like the old-fashioned slush pile of unsolicited manuscripts that editors have been receiving -- and reading sporadically -- for decades.</p>
        <p>''We look at electronic publishing as a medium that can expand an author's audience rather than cannibalize it,'' the executive said. ''First of all, we're really hurting with younger readers. Our audience is tending to move more and more to north of 45. We really feel we have lost a huge chunk of that audience in the 18 to 34 range, and it seems to me that electronic books will really hit hardest with the younger readers.''</p>
        <p>Initially, Microsoft's giveaway of Crichton novels will be available only through one bookseller, Barnesandnoble.com.</p>
        <p>But even so, competitors like Gemstar appreciate that the software giant has made the move. The company has struck a partnership with the French electronics maker Thomson Multimedia in an effort to manufacture and sell more than half a million electronic book devices this fall.</p>
        <p>''Renowned authors such as Michael Crichton will bring a great deal of credibility to the reading community and will go along way to usher in the age of electronic books,'' said Gemstar's chief executive, Henry Yuen, who has been making the round of publishers' suites in search of titles that can be offered digitally. ''I expect that this type of endorsement will be followed by other major publishers and authors.''</p>
