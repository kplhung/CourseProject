        <p>Rejecting an appeal by New York State, the United States Supreme Court agreed today with Yonkers officials that the state should continue paying half the cost of racially integrating the city's schools.</p>
        <p>The court, without comment, let stand an appellate court's ruling that the state must share with the city the costs of a desegregation plan -- about $85 million a year -- that includes magnet schools and voluntary busing in the city's 26,000-student school district, the state's fourth largest.</p>
        <p>The decision reaffirms earlier court rulings that the state is partly liable because it ''failed to take corrective measures'' to desegregate the schools. As a result, New York State will no longer contest fiscal obligations arising from the original case, which dates to 1980.</p>
        <p>''We respect the court's decision,'' said Juanita Scarlett, a spokeswoman for the state attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer.</p>
        <p>Practically speaking, though, the decision is more symbolic than substantive, since the state has been paying its share of desegregation costs for the last few years -- albeit under protest. A far more important and contentious issue is whether the state and the city should pay as much as $1.1 billion more over eight years to remedy damage from the ''vestiges of segregation'' -- intangible effects like disparities in the test scores of white and minority students.</p>
        <p>That issue, now in the hands of Judge Leonard B. Sand, is what all the parties are gearing up for, possibly by late this summer, as the next  watershed in the tortuous 20-year battle to end racial segregation here.</p>
        <p>''This is just another footnote,'' said Raymond P. Fitzpatrick Jr., a Birmingham, Ala., lawyer who represents the City of Yonkers.</p>
        <p>The case, which has stirred deep and sometimes unruly passions, began in 1980 when the federal government sued the city and the Board of Education, accusing them of intentionally maintaining racially segregated schools. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People later joined the suit.</p>
        <p>In 1985, Judge Sand, of Federal District Court in Manhattan, upheld the suit; a year later, he ordered the city to desegregate the school system by busing thousands of children across town and creating dozens of magnet programs. He also ordered the city to build subsidized housing in predominantly white sections.</p>
        <p>Eventually, a federal appellate court ordered the state to pay some of the costs of court-ordered desegregation. In 1997, the state challenged that ruling, but the Supreme Court declined to hear the case.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, on a separate but closely related track, Judge Sand ordered the state in 1997 to contribute $575 million over eight years toward various remedies addressing the results -- rather than the intent -- of the segregation. The remedies included new curricular standards, and the recruitment and training of new teachers better equipped to handle a diverse student body.</p>
        <p>And for one school year, 1998-99,  the school system did adopt a budget addressing what the court called the ''vestiges of segregation,'' with the state footing much of the additional bill, said Michael Sussman, a lawyer for the N.A.A.C.P. But that decision is now on appeal, and the result has plunged the state, the city and the school board into more budgetary conflict.</p>
        <p>The state even tried to excuse itself from financial obligations for the results of segregation, only to be rebuffed, again, by the Supreme Court today.</p>
        <p>''What this does is reaffirm the basic underpinning of the case,'' said Lawrence Thomas, a lawyer for the Yonkers Board of Education. ''It makes it very clear that the state is firmly on the hook for any remedy that's deployed in Yonkers, and that includes both the earlier remedy, and the proposed remedy with regard to vestiges.''</p>
