        <p>Unable to reach an agreement with Michael Jordan, St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis stepped away from the negotiating table yesterday and withdrew his name from consideration for the Washington Wizards' head coaching job.</p>
        <p>Talks between Robert Ades, Jarvis's agent, and Jordan, the Wizards' president of basketball operations, appeared to have stalled over decision-making power and matters of money. Jarvis was thought to be seeking about $3 million a year, or nearly $1 million more than the Wizards were offering.</p>
        <p>Ades and Jordan met briefly last week to discuss the parameters of a negotiation. The two sides, however, do not appear to have moved toward a resolution since then.</p>
        <p>Jarvis has coached St. John's for two years and led the Red Storm to the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament both times. But he appeared to be a natural fit in Washington because of his relationship with Jordan -- he coached Jordan on an all-American team when Jordan was in high school.</p>
        <p>Also, Jarvis has roots in Washington, where he coached at George Washington University for eight years before coming to New York. His daughter lives in the area, and Jarvis and his wife, Connie, still have a home in the Maryland suburbs.</p>
        <p>St. John's was beset by strife last season, brought on by an N.C.A.A. investigation centered around point guard Erick Barkley. Jarvis reacted bitterly to the investigation.</p>
        <p>When word surfaced that Jordan was interested in talking to him about the Wizards' job, Jarvis, who has in the past talked openly of his desire to work in the National Basketball Association, made no secret of his interest.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, we have not been able to come to a mutual agreement,'' Jarvis said in a statement released through St. John's last night. ''I wish to now turn my full attention and energy to the task of preparing for the next season at St. John's University. I would like to express my appreciation to the Wizards' organization, especially Michael Jordan, for their interest. I wish the Wizards great success with their coaching search and in the future seasons to come.''</p>
        <p>Jarvis must now contend with the continuing N.C.A.A. investigation and with a recruiting class that just lost one of its jewels: Darius Miles opted to skip college to enter the National Basketball Association draft this summer.</p>
        <p>Barkley, too, is gone to the draft. But St. John's has managed to avert an even bigger loss and, with it, the need for a coaching search.</p>
        <p>Although St. John's supported Jarvis as he pursued the Wizards' job, the school's administration was elated that Jarvis said he was not leaving.</p>
        <p>''I am delighted that Mike is staying with us,'' the Rev. Donald J. Harrington, the university president, said. ''He has been in regular contact throughout the process and I was more than willing to support Mike and Connie and their decision, whatever it be.</p>
        <p>''I consider St. John's blessed that they will continue to enhance our university community.''</p>
