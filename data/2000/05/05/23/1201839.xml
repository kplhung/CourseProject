        <p>If you are Anthony Roth Costanzo, your year looks something like this:</p>
        <p>Sing solo with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. Perform in ''The Marriage of Figaro'' with the Santa Barbara Grand Opera. Accept the Independent Spirit Award for best debut performance in a feature film. Sing the narration for dance performances in Italy and Athens.</p>
        <p>Oh, and take the SAT's, campaign for student council president (win), apply to Princeton early (get in), star in the school musical, attend the prom, fly back from Italy to attend graduation, and two weeks ago, turn 18.</p>
        <p>If you think it is easy to be impressed with yourself, think again, because not only do your classmates have resumes that sparkle as much as yours -- concert pianists who have performed for the heads of the Commonwealth nations, professional ballerinas with perfect SAT's -- but they got into the Ivy League, too.</p>
        <p>The Professional Children's School, offstage home to all these students, has long suffered a reputation as a haven for what one teacher calls ''the Gypsy Rose Lee type.'' Tucked behind Lincoln Center, it is seen as the place pushy stage mothers and chain-smoking managers send their child stars so they can continue their careers without having to crack a book. Forget college. From Milton Berle and Tuesday Weld to Uma Thurman and Ricki Lake, students here had more glamorous places to pull their all-nighters.</p>
        <p>In the orbit of Manhattan private schools, it has been the oddball, earning a mere page and a half of description in guidebooks that lavish 10 pages on a Collegiate or a Spence School.</p>
        <p>But now, when elite private schools are complaining that it is tougher than ever to get their students into college -- and when, statistically speaking, it is -- Professional Children's School is boasting of astonishing success in getting its students into the nation's premier colleges.</p>
        <p>This year, about 80 percent of its 46 seniors will go to college, up from about 30 or 40 percent 20 years ago. Fourteen of those applied only to Juilliard. But of the 22 who sought places in academic colleges and universities, 10 got into the Ivy League, and that does not include Johns Hopkins, Stanford and other top institutions that accepted students.</p>
        <p>''People used to think of our kids as the wild kids,'' said James Dawson, headmaster for five years. ''But if you're taking the well-rounded-person approach to college, there's no question our kids have a certain cachet. They're very passionate, they're very successful, and they can read. Colleges are getting so many applications from outstanding students, there's not a lot of difference between a 98.6 and a 98.7, but there are probably not a lot of kids who have just performed live on the BBC.''</p>
        <p>The school's rising fortunes reflect a shift in how a society enamored of celebrity views child stars -- and indeed, childhood.</p>
        <p>When life before 16 was an idyll of unstructured summers and wide open afternoons, ''professional children'' seemed an oxymoron. The elite looked with disdain on acting. But now, with Hollywood an integral part of the elite, child stars are not just acceptable, they are enviable.</p>
        <p>''There was a time when Americans were not so taken with precocious children because the natural order of things is that the adults are the experienced ones, the children get their knowledge from the adults,'' said Kay S. Hymowitz, author of ''Ready or Not: Why Treating Children as Small Adults Endangers Their Future -- and Ours'' (The Free Press, 1999).</p>
        <p>In some sense, she added, everyone is a stage mother now.</p>
        <p>With parents now packaging their children for admission to exclusive schools starting at age 2, it has become harder to top the list of achievements those same children accrue by age 18.</p>
        <p>''We're all trying to figure out where our kids can be famous,'' Ms. Hymowitz said. ''We are living in a celebrity culture, and it accrues to the parents as well if your child is a star.''</p>
        <p>Professional Children's School opened in 1914, the brainchild not of educators or performers but of two theatergoers, Jean Greer Robinson and Jane Harris Hall. According to legend, the two women went backstage to visit a friend who was performing in ''Daddy Long Legs'' and were shocked on their way to discover children from the cast betting over card games. As old as 14, the children could not read or write, and had never attended school. Boston and Chicago had recently banned children from the stage for precisely that reason. Professional Children's School, the two women decided, would offer New Yorkers another option.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dawson, the headmaster, rushed to point out that this is not the ''Fame'' school (though Irene Cara, the movie's star, did go here). That film was based on the public High School for the Performing Arts, now merged with La Guardia High School, and as the headmaster pointed out dryly, here, ''there are no production numbers in the physics labs.''</p>
        <p>The focus of the school has always been academics, not performance. Admission is based on scores and grades, not on an audition. Students sign an academic contract agreeing to rules about completing work. Students who go on the road -- to film a movie or to travel with a stage production -- have to submit a form explaining the professional assignment and agreeing to a schedule for finishing any exams or assignments they will miss. The teachers then give them laptops and several weeks' worth of assignments. For Mr. Costanzo, for instance, that meant taking English and French exams in between performances in Santa Barbara.</p>
        <p>Still, the school struggles somewhat to keep its focus on schoolwork. Almost every year, teachers debate whether to hang the usual head shots in the school lobby; some think such a display emphasizes what Mr. Dawson calls the fluffy aspects of the students. This year, as counterbalance, the college acceptance list is posted, too.</p>
        <p>What people hear about Professional Children's School tends to focus on that fluffier side. Mr. Dawson bristles in particular over the behavior of one network show that camped outside the school to get gossip about Macaulay Culkin and his Professional Children's School sweetheart, who had just been married at 17, and based a tawdry report on the comments of someone who had identified himself as the school chef. (The school has never had a chef.)</p>
        <p>Inside, this looks much like any other school. Posters for the prom and elementary-school-children's artwork decorate the walls, hulking backpacks crowd the narrow halls, bells signal the change of classes. Students here say they like this atmosphere because it allows them to disappear into anonymity for a while.</p>
        <p>''It's so much better to be with people who are doing the same kinds of things,'' said Berenika Zakrzewski, 17, a senior who hardly looked the part of concert pianist as she slouched in class with her painted toenails protruding from her clunky shoes and her long hair held back with sunglasses. ''Nobody's anxious or talking about who's doing what; everybody just does their own thing.''</p>
        <p>Clearly, though, this is not a typical school. There is no adolescent mumbling in class; perhaps not surprisingly, these students project when they read aloud or raise their hands to answer questions. They are allowed coffee in class, a concession to late-night performances, and carry cell phones in case their careers call.</p>
        <p>The school draws most of its students from ballet, so the building empties out midmorning as many dancers leave for rehearsals, then come back for more political thought or calculus. On Wednesdays, the students Mr. Dawson calls the Broadway kids leave midday for matinees. Class sizes vary by the week, depending on who is performing where. Miss Zakrzewski, for instance, left for six weeks almost as soon as school started in the fall on a concert tour of Poland, her birthplace, and she was on a monthlong tour of Canada, where she grew up, when she learned that she had been accepted to Harvard and Juilliard in April.</p>
        <p>Those kinds of acceptances have become more and more typical here, and most students are also getting large scholarships. The attractiveness of these students suggests a change in how colleges define diversity.</p>
        <p>''Harvard's well aware of the fact that Yale's had this reputation for a place to have a good community of actors, and Harvard would like to be that too,'' said Vincent Napolitano, a history teacher and the school's college adviser. ''Dartmouth has this image of being a bastion of conservatism, so they would like to have it, too.''</p>
        <p>But the increasingly well-worn path to college also suggests a change in what the teenage musicians, actors and dancers here define as training.</p>
        <p>''When I started 17 years ago, I knew nothing about the arts,'' Mr. Napolitano said. ''I would get ballet dancers with good grades and say 'Have you thought about college?' and they'd almost break down and cry. They thought I was passing judgment of some kind.''</p>
        <p>If they agreed to go to college, he added, they did so most often because they were dancers and worried that they might get hurt and have to leave ballet. Now, their art gives them an edge in getting into a good college. But they also believe that a college education gives them an edge in their art.</p>
        <p>''When I was doing 'The Marriage of Figaro,' I wanted to read the play so I understood the opera,'' Mr. Costanzo said. ''Then I decided it would be better if I could read it in the original French, then, did I want to read the sequel?''</p>
        <p>Knowing some political philosophy helped, too, he added.</p>
        <p>''The comments in the reviews were, 'Anthony Costanzo kept true to the spirit of the French Revolution.' '' he said. ''It just gives you so much more context.''</p>
        <p>Most of the students are remarkably humble about their accomplishments. Mr. Napolitano recalled that Faye Arthurs, who recently joined the New York City Ballet, and happened to have perfect SAT scores, came into his office and asked, ''Do you think Harvard and Columbia might be interested in me?''</p>
        <p>''I'll say 'Didn't you perform in Denmark, didn't Peter Martins send you there?' and they'll say, 'Oh, do you think I should mention that on my application?' '' Mr. Napolitano said. ''I tell them, ''There are people who are talking about being the bumblebee in their third-grade assembly. You think that's interesting?' ''</p>
        <p>Getting into an Ivy League university, however, can create some uncomfortable situations. Miss Arthurs got into Harvard, but with her career taking off, she will defer her entrance indefinitely.</p>
        <p>Miss Zakrzewski will begin at Harvard in the fall. But she will not be in Cambridge for long; she has already accepted a repeat engagement as a soloist with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra on Oct. 5.</p>
        <p>Will Harvard allow her to miss class?</p>
        <p>She rolled her eyes toward the sunglasses still holding back her long hair and said, ''They'll just have to deal.''</p>
