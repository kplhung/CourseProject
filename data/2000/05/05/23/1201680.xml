        <p>Elliott Smith was remarkably comfortable on Wednesday night at Irving Plaza, leading his high-kicking rock band through the first of three sold-out performances.</p>
        <p>Such ease normally wouldn't be worth mentioning; one expects confidence from fine craftsman like this singer and songwriter. But vulnerability has always been Mr. Smith's other gift, earning him the love of tenderhearted collegiates and jaded hipsters ready to thaw. That Mr. Smith no longer cares to fulfill the image of a damaged male ingenue is a credit to his now full-fledged musicality.</p>

        <p>Elliott Smith was remarkably comfortable on Wednesday night at Irving Plaza, leading his high-kicking rock band through the first of three sold-out performances.</p>
        <p>Such ease normally wouldn't be worth mentioning; one expects confidence from fine craftsman like this singer and songwriter. But vulnerability has always been Mr. Smith's other gift, earning him the love of tenderhearted collegiates and jaded hipsters ready to thaw. That Mr. Smith no longer cares to fulfill the image of a damaged male ingenue is a credit to his now full-fledged musicality.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith is as taken with liberating melodies as he is with lyrics about psychic confinement, and he honors songcraft above all on his latest album, ''Figure 8'' (DreamWorks). New songs like ''Can't Make a Sound'' and ''Stupidity Tries'' still elaborate on his big theme, the failure and/or refusal to connect: ''Got a foot in the door, God knows what for,'' are the latter song's first words. But bouncy arpeggios set the dour sentiment against itself, and Mr. Smith hit every fleeting note on Wednesday as that tight band wove sturdy riffs behind him.</p>
        <p>The template Mr. Smith uses, playing light against dark, has been reading brighter since he moved to Los Angeles last year. It's not just the perpetual sun, which ''keeps me up for days,'' as he sang in a new song; it's the chance to trade ideas with studio scientists like Fiona Apple's producer, Jon Brion, and to play with snappy sidemen like Aaron Embry, keyboardist and guitarist, and Scott McPherson, drummer, who joined him onstage along with his longtime ally in indie pop perfectionism, the bassist Sam Coomes.</p>
        <p>The band crunched hard into riffs that recalled the Eagles, then pulled itself together neatly for a Merseybeat sound. Mr. Smith's artistic infatuation with George Harrison found further expression in an encore cover of his ''I Me Mine.'' But the Beatles were only one touchstone in Mr. Smith's historical pastiche.</p>
        <p>Like Beck, who also uses the production team of Tom Rothrock and Rob Schnapf, Mr. Smith dialectically links two strains of pop. Beck plays on the contradictions between his white bohemian background and the mainstream black music he enjoys; Mr. Smith melds the pathos of the confessional singer and songwriter and the artifice of 1960's radio hits.</p>
        <p>The next step for Mr. Smith is to find a lyrical approach to match his expanding sound. The imagistic songs on ''Figure 8'' find him developing the verbal confidence he now fully wields in his music. As he seeks words as penetratingly simple as his Beatle heroes did, Mr. Smith is working toward having nothing to be nervous about.</p>
