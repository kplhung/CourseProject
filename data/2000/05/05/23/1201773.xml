        <p>The Nets' principal owner, Lewis Katz, and the entire organization were aglow on Sunday after receiving the first pick in this summer's National Basketball Association draft. But their elation can quickly turn to confusion and embarrassment if the franchise does not soon fill its vacant front-office positions.</p>
        <p>If the Nets wait too long to hire a president and director of basketball operations to handle the draft, they could wind up wasting or botching what is a golden opportunity to greatly improve their ball club. Currently, General Manager John Nash and his staff of scouts and assistant coaches are managing the draft, but they will eventually have to answer to a new boss and may even lose their jobs.</p>
        <p>The Nets have been without a president since reassigning Michael Rowe three weeks ago and without a coach since firing Don Casey last month. How long can the Nets leave the No. 1 pick in the hands of people who may be fired shortly before or after the draft?</p>
        <p>Last week, the YankeeNets chairman, Harvey Schiller, said the Nets hoped to hire a top basketball executive by the beginning of June. The draft is June 28 in Minneapolis.</p>
        <p>The Nets must decide whether to draft one of the top college players -- who include Cincinnati forward Kenyon Martin, Texas center Chris Mihm, Iowa State forward Marcus Fizer or Louisiana State forward Stromile Swift -- or trade the pick.</p>
        <p>Four of the leading candidates for the Nets' top basketball position appear to be Los Angeles Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak, Indiana Pacers General Manager David Kahn, the former Georgetown coach John Thompson and Isiah Thomas, the majority owner of the Continental Basketball Association and former part-owner and executive of the Toronto Raptors.</p>
        <p>The Nets reportedly interviewed Thompson on Friday and have received permission to speak with Kupchak and Kahn.</p>
        <p>A YankeeNets official confirmed last week that Thomas was a candidate for the director's position or head coach, or both. Thomas, whose name has also been linked to coaching jobs in Dallas, Indiana and Atlanta, stated as much yesterday.</p>
        <p>When asked how attractive he found the Nets' situation, Thomas said:</p>
        <p>''In a situation like this, as a candidate for the job, you have to be very careful about analyzing or critiquing because you don't want people to perceive it as politicking for it. It's best that I don't say anything other than that the situation speaks for itself. It's a good situation and a good opportunity for whoever walks into that situation.''</p>
        <p>In the cases of Kupchak and Kahn, the Nets may have to wait until their teams complete their seasons. Kahn said last week that he asked the Nets to postpone formal interviews until the Pacers were finished playing, but left himself some wiggle room by stating that if an appropriate time presented itself during Indiana's playoff run, he might be willing to sit down with the Nets.</p>
        <p>If either Kupchak, who one YankeeNets official said is the top choice, or Kahn is serious about going to the Nets, he will almost certainly have to decide before the end of the playoffs. The latest possible date for Game 7 of the N.B.A. finals is June 21, just one week before the draft.</p>
