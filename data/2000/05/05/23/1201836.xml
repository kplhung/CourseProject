        <p>A homeless man tried to push four waiting passengers onto the tracks at two subway stations yesterday in downtown Manhattan, but all four survived the attacks, the police said.</p>
        <p>The first attack occurred shortly before noon at the West Fourth Street subway station in Greenwich Village. A 20-year-old woman managed to save herself from falling in front of an approaching train only by keeping an iron grip on a platform pillar until an onlooker intervened, approaching the attacker from behind and kicking him, officials said. As the woman fled, the assailant  boarded a train.</p>
        <p>The police said that 20 minutes later, the attacker, whom they identified as Paul O'Dwyer, 47, individually attacked two women and a man, trying to push them to the tracks at the Broadway-Lafayette Street station. The police said no trains were approaching at the time.</p>
        <p>The man who was attacked alerted the police. The officers found Mr. O'Dwyer, who was carrying a plastic bag full of clothing, on the platform near a girder, the police said.</p>
        <p>When the officers called the police dispatcher, they learned that Mr. O'Dwyer fit the description of the man in the earlier attack, the police said.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Dwyer was admitted to Bellevue Hospital Center after a psychiatric evaluation, then was placed back in police custody. The police said Mr. O'Dwyer was charged with assault, reckless endangerment and unlawful imprisonment.</p>
        <p>The attacks happened more than a year after Kendra Webdale was pushed to her death in front of a subway train by Andrew Goldstein, who had been in and out of the mental health system for years.</p>
        <p>But Mr. O'Dwyer did not appear to have a similar history. Roger Klingman, a spokesman for the State Office of Mental Health, said Mr. O'Dwyer had not been admitted to any state mental health centers.</p>
        <p>The police said that Mr. O'Dwyer had no criminal record in the city, and did not immediately appear to have a history of violence.</p>
