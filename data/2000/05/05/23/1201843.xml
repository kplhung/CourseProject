        <p>A Manhattan jury awarded a construction worker and former all-American college basketball player $15.8 million on Friday for back injuries he suffered in a fall from a ladder in the World Trade Center in 1995. The award, one of the largest of its kind in the city, could be reduced by a judge.</p>
        <p>Mark Butigian, 37, a former steamfitter, fell from a ladder on Feb. 3, 1995, while renovating office space leased by an insurance company on the 50th floor of the World Trade Center, his lawyer said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Butigian, of Rockaway, Queens, was an all-city basketball player at Archbishop Molloy High School and an all-American basketball player at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut, his lawyer said.</p>
        <p>As a result of the accident, Mr. Butigian is unable to work and has undergone three operations to reduce chronic back pain. His lawyer, David Breitbart, said the accident occurred when Mr. Butigian's employer, Computercool Air Conditioning of Queens, had him use a ladder instead of a more expensive scaffold to remove air-conditioning ducts.</p>
        <p>The jury announced its verdict on Friday after a two-week trial.</p>
        <p>It was unclear yesterday which of the three defendants in the case would pay the award or whether it would be appealed. Allen Morrison, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the World Trade Center, said the insurance firm that commissioned the work was liable. Officials at the firm, Guy Carpenter &amp; Co., said they had no comment. Officials for the general contractor, John Gallin &amp; Son, said they had no comment.</p>
        <p>Under workers' compensation law, the subcontractor Mr. Butigian was working for, Computercool Air Conditioning of Queens, could not be sued, Mr. Breitbart said. Computercool officials did not respond to a phone message requesting comment.</p>
