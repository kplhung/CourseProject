        <p>Pacing the Floor, Instead of Taking It</p>
        <p>SENATOR ROBERT G. TORRICELLI dated PATRICIA DUFF in 1998 and 1999. Then they stopped seeing each other. Then she subpoenaed him to testify in the long-running child custody case involving her former husband, the billionaire RONALD O. PERELMAN.</p>
        <p>Yesterday was supposed to be his day on the witness stand. But after Mr. Torricelli had spent the day standing in a corridor outside JUSTICE EILEEN C.

When Ms. Duff's lawyer complained that Mr. Torricelli had been waiting all day, the justice said, ''I didn't call him in to wait all day.'' The justice suggested scheduling him for tomorrow morning, but Ms. Duff's lawyer, TOBY KLEINMAN, said that Congress would be in session on Wednesday and that Mr. Torricelli could not appear then.</p>

        <p>Pacing the Floor, Instead of Taking It</p>
        <p>SENATOR ROBERT G. TORRICELLI dated PATRICIA DUFF in 1998 and 1999. Then they stopped seeing each other. Then she subpoenaed him to testify in the long-running child custody case involving her former husband, the billionaire RONALD O. PERELMAN.</p>
        <p>Yesterday was supposed to be his day on the witness stand. But after Mr. Torricelli had spent the day standing in a corridor outside JUSTICE EILEEN C. BRANSTEN'S courtroom while lawyers questioned another witness, the judge adjourned the hearing without letting him take the stand. When Ms. Duff's lawyer complained that Mr. Torricelli had been waiting all day, the justice said, ''I didn't call him in to wait all day.'' The justice suggested scheduling him for tomorrow morning, but Ms. Duff's lawyer, TOBY KLEINMAN, said that Congress would be in session on Wednesday and that Mr. Torricelli could not appear then.</p>
        <p>''I think this judge's ire is palpable,'' she said. ''I think her not allowing Senator Torricelli to testify when he has been waiting all day is disrespectful to a U.S. senator. It's also not probative of trying to get to the truth.''</p>
        <p>At least when Mr. Torricelli returns to testify, his face will be familiar. At one point yesterday, Mr. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, asked a guard where a bathroom was. ''And who are you?'' the guard demanded.</p>
        <p>The Next Time, Yell 'Fore' First</p>
        <p>MICHAEL CARUSO wanted to generate some attention for his new magazine, Maximum Golf, so he scheduled a golf party for tonight. He sent invitations to MONICA S. LEWINSKY, DONALD J. TRUMP, ISAAC HAYES and other celebrities.</p>
        <p>He told them to gather at the Loeb Boathouse by the Lake in Central Park and to be ready to do battle with a 9-iron. He arranged to float a 45-foot-wide green on the lake. He promised $1 million to any guest who managed to sink a hole in one, though at least half would go to charity.</p>
        <p>But he forgot one detail: a city permit.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the parks commissioner, HENRY J. STERN, dismissed the idea of using the Central Park Lake as a putting green. ''Ridiculous,'' Mr. Stern said. ''The lake is not for rent.'' Errant golf balls could crush plants and harm fish, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern said he did not hear about the floating green until Saturday, when the owner of the restaurant, JEANNE CRETELLA, faxed a request to the Parks Department seeking permission.</p>
        <p>Mr. Caruso said late yesterday that there was a ''little bit of a glitch, but we are working it out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern's response sounded as if there was nothing to work out: ''They can't do that.'' If the magazine tries to have celebrities swatting balls into the lake, Mr. Stern said, ''we will physically prevent it.''</p>
        <p>Swelling the Ranks Of a Book Party</p>
        <p>You find yourself in a city not your own. You have an enormous but borrowed Park Avenue apartment to fill with guests for your book party, given by the novelist BRET EASTON ELLIS; MARINA RUST, a contributing editor of Vogue magazine; NANCY JARECKI, a painter; and the apartment owner, ASHLEY McDERMOTT. You have friends like MORGAN ENTREKIN, publisher of Grove/Atlantic, and the waitress who served you at Pastis the night before, JONELLE LENNON.</p>
        <p>But you need a bigger crowd.</p>
        <p>So MARK LINDQUIST, a Seattle sex crimes prosecutor and sometime book critic, as well as the author of the novel ''Never Mind Nirvana'' (Villard), invited people whose books he had reviewed.</p>
        <p>MAGGIE ESTEP went because he had praised ''Soft Maniacs,'' her collection of stories. LARRY DAVID said that Mr. Lindquist had given his book, ''Family Values,'' a ''very nice review'' in The Seattle Times. BEN NEIHART said he had debated coming because Mr. Lindquist's assessment of his novel ''Burning Girl'' had been mixed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellis laughed when asked about Mr. Lindquist's review of ''Glamorama.''</p>
        <p>'He called it -- well, I'm throwing the party for him,'' he said. ''He called it 'arguably the novel of the 90's.' ''</p>
        <p>Who Wanted to Be An Emmy Winner?</p>
        <p>REGIS PHILBIN was nominated with KATHIE LEE GIFFORD in the ''outstanding talk show host category'' at the Daytime Emmy Awards the other night. He was also nominated as ''outstanding game show host'' for ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Philbin's name was not announced in either host category, Ms. Gifford, his co-host on ''Live With Regis and Kathie Lee,'' leaned over and said, ''Regis, you were robbed.''</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Philbin; Ms. Gifford; Mr. Philbin's wife, JOY; and a dozen other people in the second and third rows of Radio City Music Hall got up and walked out.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman said Ms. Gifford had repeated her remark on ''Live'' yesterday. As for why they left, the spokeswoman said: ''If he jumped up and got up, it was that he was trying to make it to a party for the 'Millionaire' staff downtown. He didn't want to be out too late.''</p>
