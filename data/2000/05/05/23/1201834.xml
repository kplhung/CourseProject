        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan recommended to the Security Council today that the United Nations not increase the size of its peacekeeping force in Lebanon until Israel withdraws and Lebanon guarantees the safety of the troops. Only then would the United Nations consider increasing its force to nearly 8,000 from the current 4,500, according to a plan Mr. Annan sent to the council.</p>
        <p>''You want us to be a punching bag in the middle with everybody taking pot shots at us?''

        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan recommended to the Security Council today that the United Nations not increase the size of its peacekeeping force in Lebanon until Israel withdraws and Lebanon guarantees the safety of the troops. Only then would the United Nations consider increasing its force to nearly 8,000 from the current 4,500, according to a plan Mr. Annan sent to the council.</p>
        <p>''You want us to be a punching bag in the middle with everybody taking pot shots at us?'' Mr. Annan responded to reporters after a council meeting today when he was questioned about the measured recommendations in his report. ''Everybody would then blame the U.N. for everything we are not responsible for,'' he added, apparently stung by recent criticism about the performance of United Nations peacekeeping.</p>
        <p>As an interim measure, Mr. Annan recommended that the United Nations, which has stationed peacekeepers in southern Lebanon since 1978, should augment the force only slightly -- to 5,600 troops -- strictly for the purposes of verifying the Israeli pullback and the disarming of the Israel's Lebanese allies.</p>
        <p>''It is the responsibility of the government of Israel to ensure that the de facto force, known as the South Lebanon Army, cease to exist,'' Mr. Annan's report says, calling the militia ''part of Israel's presence in Lebanon.'' The United Nations will not be involved in disarming it.</p>
        <p>According to United Nations plans, Mr. Annan's envoy to the region, Terje Roed Larsen, will return there on Tuesday after meeting with United Nations officials and the Security Council today. Before verification flights can be made over the Israeli-Lebanese border, he will need the approval of Lebanon, Syria and Israel. Only then can airborne cartographers try to demarcate the boundaries of the three countries, but only to monitor them. Troops for the larger monitoring and peacekeeping force are not likely to be recruited until after the Israeli withdrawal.</p>
