        <p>Gov. George W. Bush today accused the Clinton administration of taking sides in last year's Israeli election and of trying to make Israel conform to American ''plans and timetables'' for peace. The governor said his own support for Israel was ''not conditional on the outcome of the peace process.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush leveled his criticisms in a speech on the Middle East at the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group. His appearance was part of a sustained effort in recent days to address what many consider to be his chief vulnerability as a presidential candidate: his command of foreign affairs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, who was repeatedly interrupted by applause, said little on the Middle East that he had not said before. Once again, he pledged that as president he would ''begin the process of moving the U.S. ambassador to the city Israel has chosen as its capital,'' a reference to Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>His most pointed remarks concerned the administration's role in Middle East peace talks over the years.</p>
        <p>''In recent times Washington has tried to make Israel conform to its own plans and timetables,'' he said, drawing applause, ''but this is not the path to peace.''</p>
        <p>''A clear and bad example,'' he said, ''was the administration's attempt to take sides in the most recent Israeli election. America should not interfere in Israel's democratic process, and America will not interfere in Israeli elections when I'm the president.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did not elaborate. Aides said his comments about a timetable referred to the nine days and nights of tortuous Wye River negotiations on Maryland's Eastern Shore, which committed the Israelis and Palestinians to actions they had promised in previous agreements. The talks restored momentum to the peace process, setting a detailed timetable for Israel's withdrawal from part of the West Bank in three phases.</p>
        <p>Although some Republicans praised the agreement, others said Israel was being unduly pressured.</p>
        <p>Responding to the accusation of playing favorites in the election, Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, called it ''irresponsible to make such reckless comments concerning such a sensitive part of the world'' and said ''it really does raise a question of his readiness to be a leader in international affairs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lehane said, ''Al Gore's leadership credentials on facilitating the Middle East peace process are impeccable while Bush is suffering from an antiquated analysis reminiscent of the Republican approach of the 1980's.''</p>
        <p>Although the Clinton administration maintained studied public neutrality in last year's Israeli elections, it made little effort to conceal its desire for Ehud Barak's victory over then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. James Carville, President Clinton's former political adviser, served in a similar role for Mr. Barak. In 1996, Mr. Clinton all but openly endorsed Shimon Peres, the Labor Party candidate, over Mr. Netanyahu because of the difference in the candidates' views of the peace process.</p>
        <p>In appearances before Jewish groups, presidential candidates frequently promise to move the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. The status of Jerusalem, which Israel regards as its capital, is a central issue in ''final status'' peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, and the administration says moving the embassy would pre-empt the delicate negotiations and destroy Washington's ability to act as an honest broker in peace talks.</p>
        <p>In his failed presidential bid in 1988, Mr. Gore said he would consider moving the embassy to Jerusalem, but his aides now say he sees the issue as something that should be worked out in peace negotiations.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Barak was supposed to attend the American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference today and meet with both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore. But over the weekend he canceled his visit to the United States because of violence in the West Bank and South Lebanon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said he was ''deeply disturbed'' by the reports of the Palestinian police opening fire on Israeli soldiers last week.</p>
        <p>''This is certainly no way to make peace a reality,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also said that Iran's leaders should be put on notice that ''America will judge them'' by the treatment of 13 Jews imprisoned in Iran on charges of espionage.</p>
        <p>Little more than a year ago, Mr. Bush came under criticism for silence on the West's air war in Kosovo. And more than a few critics have questioned how capable he would be, as president, on foreign policy issues. In the Republican primaries, his main opponent, Senator John McCain of Arizona, repeatedly said that he himself would not need ''on-the-job training,'' a way of belittling Mr. Bush's credentials to be commander in chief.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has openly acknowledged that he is studying international issues, telling reporters that he is reading ''Lenin's Tomb,'' a book about the Soviet Union by David Remnick, and ''Balkan Ghosts,'' an account of turmoil in the Balkans by Robert D. Kaplan.</p>
        <p>In recent days, Mr. Bush has been raising his profile on international affairs. Last week he took positions on pending Congressional disputes on financing for Kosovo peace-keeping and on trade with China.</p>
        <p>He plans to speak further on national security at a Washington news conference on Tuesday and to meet with the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, in Austin, Tex., later this week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mbeki met with Mr. Gore today before attending a State dinner with Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Introducing Mr. Bush today, Mayer Mitchell, a former president of the public affairs committee, told the audience that if they did not know Mr. Bush well, they did know the foreign policy advisers surrounding him. Mr. Mitchell named a host of former aides to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.</p>
        <p>In a separate appearance here today before the National Association of Realtors, Mr. Bush called for a crackdown on ''frivolous and junk lawsuits'' and said lawyers who filed multiple ''junk lawsuits'' should be barred from appearing in federal court for three years.</p>
        <p>And he ended the day with a fund-raiser that was expected to bring in $350,000 to $400,000 for his campaign.</p>
        <p>In His Own Words: GEORGE W. BUSH</p>
        <p>Remarks yesterday in Washington to the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee:</p>
        <p>''I am deeply disturbed by the violence that continues in the West Bank and in South Lebanon.  And especially by reports of Palestinian police opening fire on Israeli soldiers last week. This is no way to make peace a reality. We have seen Israel's desire for peace, and what can be accomplished when moderate Arab states respond in kind. . . . In recent times, Washington has tried to make Israel conform to its own plans and timetables. But this is not the path to peace. A clear and bad example was the administration's attempt to take sides in the most recent Israeli election. America should not interfere in Israel's democratic process, and America will not interfere in Israeli elections when I'm president.</p>
        <p>But something will happen when I'm president: as soon as I take office I will begin the process of moving the U.S. ambassador to the city Israel has chosen as its capital.''</p>
