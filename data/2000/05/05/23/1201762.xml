      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Diageo P.L.C., which owns Pillsbury bakery goods and Haagen-Daz ice cream, is negotiating to buy all or part of Bestfoods, the maker of Skippy peanut butter and Hellmann's mayonnaise,  executives close to the talks said today.</p>
        <p>The negotiations come after an $18.4 billion cash offer for Bestfoods from Unilever, the Dutch-British consumer products conglomerate that recently bought Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade and Slim-Fast. That unsolicited offer -- for $66 a share -- was rebuffed, and Bestfoods has since been seeking another partner to stave off Unilever's bid.</p>
        <p>Diageo is holding trans-Atlantic negotiations with Bestfoods, based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., in hopes of combining Bestfoods' bakery business with its own bakery business and possibly spinning off the newly combined unit into a company that that might be controlled by Bestfoods' management, the executives said. While several executives close to the talks called the negotiations advanced, no agreement has been reached. The executives also cautioned that the two companies could still abandon the effort.</p>
        <p>Shares of Diageo rose 11 pence, to 557.75 pence, while Bestfoods rose 25 cents, to $63.25.</p>
        <p>It remains unclear how much Diageo would have to pay for the Bestfoods bakery business, which provided $1.66 billion of Bestfoods' $8.64 billion in sales in 1999. If Diageo proceeds with the acquisition, the deal would put such household brands as Pillsbury, Entenmann's, Thomas' English muffins and Friehofer's breads under one roof.</p>
        <p>Diageo's other businesses include, among others, Burger King, Johnnie Walker, Guinness and Tanqueray. It had annual sales of $16.3 billion in 1999.</p>
        <p>Unilever has continued to press the Bestfoods board to hold talks, though those requests have been spurned. Unilever could still decide to raise its bid, executives close to the company insisted.</p>
        <p>And Bestfoods has set up several ''poison pill'' provisions and other hurdles to protect it from hostile takeover attempts.</p>
        <p>Interest in acquiring Bestfoods is being driven by the raft of consolidation in the supermarket business, leaving companies that have food manufacturing arms like Diageo with little leverage and control over pricing their goods, forcing margins down.</p>
        <p>Last fall, it was reported that Bestfoods was in talks with H. J. Heinz. At the time, Bestfoods denied any conversations were in progress.</p>
        <p>A Bestfoods spokesman said yesterday that the company had no comment on talks with Diageo. In rejecting the Unilever offer earlier this month, Bestfoods indicated that the price was too low and added ''it is not opportune to consider a sale of the company.''</p>
        <p>Since then, executives from Unilever and Bestfoods have been busy making their cases to Wall Street analysts and investors. Bestfoods has scoffed at Unilever's claim that it could trim $500 million in costs by combining the two companies. Bestfoods executives put the potential savings at $1 billion, which some analysts think is an argument for consolidation.</p>
        <p>The Unilever offer for Bestfoods, which is considered to have one of the best-performing international food businesses, particularly in Latin America, signaled the start of what could turn out to be a wave of mergers in the food industry. Investors have been impatient with the sector's slow growth and lackluster returns, and some believe merging companies could produce cost savings and speedier product innovation, as well as give the new company more power in negotiations for retail shelf space than two smaller companies would have on their own.</p>
        <p>Nabisco brands, which include Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and LifeSavers candy, are also on the block as Nabisco Group Holdings, the holding company that owns 80.6 percent of Nabisco stock, seeks a buyer. Possible contenders include Philip Morris, the tobacco and packaged-food giant, which already owns Kraft Foods; and Groupe Danone, the French foodmaker that bought Nabisco's European cookie business in 1992.</p>
