        <p>One year shy of its 300th birthday, Yale University sent 2,779 students through its commencement gates in a two-day graduation ceremony that was  mirthful and teary.</p>
        <p>After a marathon weekend of packing up their belongings, saying goodbye and taking their last drinks at campus parties, many students filed out of Yale's Old Campus quadrangle today feeling ambiguous about their departures.</p>
        <p>''It's unexpected,'' said Thomas Cantey, a senior in Yale College. ''I didn't think I'd end up feeling this sad and misty over the last couple of days. I feel like I really became part of this place, and I realize that it's all going to be taken away, and now.''</p>
        <p>The university conferred 10 honorary degrees today. Recipients included Desmond Tutu, the retired archbishop of Cape Town, South Africa,  and William F. Buckley Jr., the conservative political writer.</p>
        <p>Archbishop Tutu got the day's only standing ovation. He was praised for  continued efforts to counter the effects of apartheid. Mr. Buckley rose to prominence in 1951, a year after graduating from Yale, when he published ''God and Man at Yale,'' a book that said the university had strayed from its Christian foundations and was teaching liberalism in the classrooms.</p>
        <p>Yale College seniors received a more personal address on Sunday, Class Day. The keynote speaker was Bob Woodward, who graduated from Yale in 1965. His investigation of the Watergate break-in helped win a Pulitzer Prize for The Washington Post  in 1973.</p>
        <p>Mr. Woodward, assistant managing editor at The Post, urged the  1,400 seniors not to allow President Clinton's impeachment last year  make them cynical about politics. He also said Mr. Clinton had not learned one lesson of Watergate, that modern leaders must make ''rapid, full and complete disclosure'' in response to  an inquiry or examination.</p>
        <p>''Don't make other peoples' mistakes,'' Mr. Woodward said. ''Armed with history, go out and make your own.''</p>
        <p>As usual, Class Day was marked by a certain air of irreverence and humor. Most graduating seniors arrived in odd headpieces atop their black robes. One who attracted considerable notice was Itai Maytal of New York, who wore a plastic image of Richard Nixon and presented himself just as Mr. Woodward began his speech.</p>
        <p>This year's graduation shared something else with those of recent years: the weather. It was a mucky, wet weekend. By Saturday morning, walkways of wood chips had turned into a sodden mess, to be negotiated by friends and relatives dressed in their finest.</p>
        <p>As a reminder of Yale's sometimes strained relationship with New Haven, a boisterous city parade outside the university drowned out the Class Day speakers every five minutes or so.</p>
        <p>Mr. Woodward had to stop and start many times, and after a particularly noisy outburst he asked, ''Is that G. Gordon Liddy?''</p>
        <p>Yale also bestowed honorary degrees on a slate of recipients accomplished in many different professional disciplines: Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan; Tom Stoppard, the British playwright; Frank O. Gehry, the architect of the new Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain; Gerhard Casper, president of Stanford University; Hugh B. Price, president of the National Urban League; Marie de la Soudiere, an international refugee worker and child advocate; Dr. Samuel Osiah Their, president of  Partners Health Care System; and Helen Vendler, the critic and literature professor at Harvard University.</p>
        <p>Jewish Theological Seminary</p>
        <p>The Jewish Theological Seminary held its commencement ceremony on Thursday afternoon at the Park Avenue Synagogue on 87th Street, where 109 undergraduate and graduate degrees were conferred and 24  rabbis were ordained.</p>
        <p>Honorary degrees were given to Paula Hyman, the Lucy Moses professor of modern Jewish history at Yale University; Hubert Markl, a scientist and president of the Max Planck Institute in Germany; Judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, former president of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia; and the commencement speaker, Stuart E. Eizenstat, deputy secretary of the Treasury and an important participant in the negotiation of compensation for Holocaust victims.</p>
        <p>Seminary faculty and board members led the procession into the ornately designed sanctuary of the synagogue, after which the American and Israeli national anthems were sung.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eizenstat told the seminary audience he was proud he was to be honored by one of ''the leading centers of Jewish education in the world.''</p>
        <p>He also spoke of the future of Jewish-Americans, which, he said, depended upon four main factors: the shared memory of 4,000 years of Jewish history; a strong identification with Israel; greater participation in rituals in synagogue activities; and the strengthening of Jewish education.</p>
