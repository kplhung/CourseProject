        <p>Perhaps Coach Larry Robinson's angry outburst  will have a positive effect on the Devils for the rest of their playoff series with the Flyers. Tonight, the Devils played with desperation and avoided elimination in the Eastern Conference finals with a convincing 4-1 victory over the Flyers.</p>
        <p>The Devils stayed focused from beginning to end in the physical battle at First Union Center, building a three-goal lead to cut their series deficit to one game.</p>
        <p>The next game of the four-of-seven-game series, which the Flyers lead by 3-2, will be at Continental Arena on Wednesday night. Game 7, if necessary, will be Friday night in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>''When you do something, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't,'' Robinson said after the game. ''This time it did. The guys were prepared and didn't want to go down by not playing our best game. A lot of times, teams in desperate situations play their best game.''</p>
        <p>From Martin Brodeur in goal to the last player on the fourth line, all the Devils performed with inspiration after New Jersey had lost three games in a row.</p>
        <p>Their 3-1 defeat on Saturday night inspired a 20-minute dressing-room tirade from Robinson -- and criticism of his players when he met with reporters -- over what the coach saw as a lack of aggressiveness on offense and poor defensive positioning.</p>
        <p>Once behind, the Devils stopped trying to get the puck deep into the offensive zone. Instead, they chose to try drop passes at the blue line, which led to several odd-man rushes by the Flyers.</p>
        <p>A strong start by the Devils helped prevent that situation from happening in this game. The Devils' Jason Arnott, Bobby Holik, Petr Sykora and Patrik Elias scored tonight against Brian Boucher, who faced 30 shots.</p>
        <p>Valery Zelepukin scored the lone goal for the Flyers against Brodeur, who faced 21 shots.</p>
        <p>''When a legend like Larry or  Slava says something, he knows what he's talking about,'' Holik said about Robinson and Slava Fetisov, his assistant. ''They tell you what it takes to win and you take it to heart. I think all the guys felt the same way I did. We let a legend like that down in the last couple games.''</p>
        <p>Arnott said: ''Larry told us what we basically needed to be successful. There was a lot of pressure on us. We wanted to have a good game and we did. It started from Marty on out.''</p>
        <p>The Flyers seemed lethargic at the outset, and the Devils came out with enthusiasm, dominating play in the first period and taking a two-goal lead.</p>
        <p>After Arnott's power-play goal, a one-timer from the left circle for his fourth in the playoffs, Holik gave the Devils a two-goal lead with 4:45 left in the period.</p>
        <p>The Flyers played at a level far below that of their previous three games, all victories. ''We stunk tonight,'' Rick Tocchet said. ''There is nothing really more to say.''</p>
        <p>The Devils almost scored at about  the seventh minute of the opening period, but were unable to get to rebounds after shots by Vladimir Malakhov and Arnott.</p>
        <p>They extended their lead to three goals on Sykora's sixth in the playoffs, just 1 minute 47 seconds into the middle period.</p>
        <p>Scott Stevens started the play with a pass on the left flank to Elias, who found Sykora alone near the right side of the crease for the easy goal. After Zelepukin narrowed the gap  for the Flyers with 4:15 left in the second period, Elias secured the Devils' victory with his fifth goal of the playoffs, just 55 seconds into the third.</p>
        <p>''We went back to what Larry wanted us to do,'' Stevens said about Robinson's instructions to stay with the game plan. ''We did the little things that Larry wanted us to do.''</p>
        <p>Ken Daneyko, who also played a solid defensive game, said Robinson's tirade two nights ago registered well with the Devils.</p>
        <p>''Larry is a pretty mild guy,'' Daneyko said. ''To see him get angry like that meant we were not doing what we were supposed to do. The guys showed up tonight and we got the win, but we still have a mountain to climb.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>RICK TOCCHET hit COLIN WHITE in the face with his stick early in the first period and was not penalized. White didn't miss a shift. . . . The Flyers announced during the first period that ERIC LINDROS had been cleared to participate in full practices. The announcement came after Lindros, coming back from his latest concussion, was examined by Dr. JAMES KELLY in Chicago Monday.</p>
