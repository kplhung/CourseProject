        <p>Researchers find the gene mutation that causes a rare disorder known as pseudoxanthoma; Sharon and Patrick Terry of Sharon, Mass, whose children have the disorder, set up a foundation called PXE International in 1996, and it has found 2,000 patients, established a repository of patients' tissue, raised money and enlisted scientists to find the gene (M)</p>

        <p>In a culmination of concerted efforts initiated by one determined family, three groups of researchers are reporting that they have found the gene mutation that causes a rare disorder known as pseudoxanthoma elasticum.</p>
        <p>The discovery is being published today in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and on June 1 in two papers in Nature Genetics.

Now that they have identified the gene, they say, they can begin figuring out how it contributes to disease, diagnose it prenatally, test for it in people whose symptoms are ambiguous and look for ways to treat the disease.</p>

        <p>In a culmination of concerted efforts initiated by one determined family, three groups of researchers are reporting that they have found the gene mutation that causes a rare disorder known as pseudoxanthoma elasticum.</p>
        <p>The discovery is being published today in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and on June 1 in two papers in Nature Genetics. The investigators say the gene, known as ABCC6, directs cells to make a protein that is similar to others, known as ABC transporters, that shuttle small molecules in and out of cells. Now that they have identified the gene, they say, they can begin figuring out how it contributes to disease, diagnose it prenatally, test for it in people whose symptoms are ambiguous and look for ways to treat the disease.</p>
        <p>The search for the gene had its origins in 1994, when a puzzled mother took her 6-year-old daughter to a dermatologist to ask about a persistent rash on the little girl's neck.</p>
        <p>The mother, Sharon Terry of Sharon, Mass., had noticed the rash a year earlier but assumed it was of no consequence and would go away. Finally, she asked a dermatologist what it was.</p>
        <p>''As soon as he looked at it, he said, 'pseudoxanthoma elasticum,' '' Ms. Terry recalled. ''Then he glanced at my son, who was 4 at the time, and said, 'Gee, he has it too.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Terry, who has a master's degree in religious studies, and her husband, Patrick, who manages a construction company, had never heard of the rare genetic disorder, which causes mineralization of tissue. They spent the weekend at the library of the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester reading everything they could find about it. And they quickly realized that not much was known. It was rare -- affecting an estimated one person in 25,000 to 50,000. And it had an array of symptoms.</p>
        <p>Patients can develop bumps on their skin, their skin can sag and wrinkle, blood vessels in their gastrointestinal tracts and those in the legs can be blocked, causing pain, and so can vessels in the heart, causing heart attacks. But the disease's most likely serious consequence is a calcification and cracking of the membrane behind the retina. Blood leaks into the eye, causing progressive and severe loss of vision, with many becoming nearly blind by the age of 40.</p>
        <p>But the 400 papers that the Terrys found on the disease were just case studies. ''We knew right away that we did not want to wait in the deli line for our number to be called and whine 'when will you do our disease?' '' Ms. Terry said. They wanted to make it irresistible for scientists to find the gene that causes it.</p>
        <p>In 1996, they set up a foundation, PXE International, found 2,000 patients, established a repository of patients' tissue, raised money and enlisted scientists. The foundation's efforts succeeded.</p>
        <p>The researchers who published their findings in Nature Genetics were led by Dr. Charles D. Boyd of the University of Hawaii and Dr. Arthur A. B. Bergen of the Netherlands Ophthalmic Research Institute in Amsterdam. The scientist who published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences is Dr. Jouni Uitto of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Dr. Uitto, who is a professor and chairman of the department of dermatology and cutaneous biology at Jefferson, proposes that when mutations disable the ABCC6 gene, toxic compounds accumulate in the body and attach themselves to elastic tissue in the skin, in blood vessels and in a membrane behind the retina. Ms. Terry said her next goal was for scientists to analyze the different mutations that could disable the ABCC6 gene to learn the reasons for the various manifestations in different people. ''We want to find a way to slow the disease down,'' she said. ''Our goal is to cure the disease.''</p>
        <p>In the meantime, it has been an intense four years running PXE International, Ms. Terry said.</p>
        <p>''I volunteer for the organization about 90 hours a week,'' she said. Her husband, she adds, spends all of his free time working for the group.</p>
        <p>''We don't do much else,'' Ms. Terry said. ''As my husband says, we don't do the laundry much.''</p>
