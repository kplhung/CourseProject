        <p>Christie Welsh is about to embark on her second excursion to Australia in less than six months. But what she really wants is a hat trick of trips to the antipodes, specifically a spot on the United States roster for the Summer Olympics in Sydney.</p>
        <p>Welsh, a 19-year-old striker from Massapequa, N.Y., is one of five young players in the running for what will probably be only two open berths on Coach April Heinrichs's powerful roster. Welsh is part of the team for the Pacific Cup, a five-nation tournament that opens for the Americans on May 31 with a rematch of last summer's Women's World Cup final against China. In 10 matches with the national team, Welsh has scored seven goals.</p>

        <p>Christie Welsh is about to embark on her second excursion to Australia in less than six months. But what she really wants is a hat trick of trips to the antipodes, specifically a spot on the United States roster for the Summer Olympics in Sydney.</p>
        <p>Welsh, a 19-year-old striker from Massapequa, N.Y., is one of five young players in the running for what will probably be only two open berths on Coach April Heinrichs's powerful roster. Welsh is part of the team for the Pacific Cup, a five-nation tournament that opens for the Americans on May 31 with a rematch of last summer's Women's World Cup final against China. In 10 matches with the national team, Welsh has scored seven goals.</p>
        <p>''I think that April has confidence in the younger players or else we wouldn't be on the team,'' Welsh said. ''I've always been a starter on the teams I've played with, but I don't expect to play against China. At this point, any playing time is a good thing for me.''</p>
        <p>As a freshman last year at Penn State, Welsh led the Nittany Lions to their first appearance in the final four of the National Collegiate Athletic Association women's tournament, where they lost in the semifinals to the eventual champion, North Carolina. She finished the season with 27 goals and 13 assists in 26 games -- leading the nation in scoring -- and was named a first-team all-American, the Big Ten Conference's player of the year and freshman of the year.</p>
        <p>If she should make the Olympic team, however, Welsh would probably have to forgo her sophomore season at Penn State.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to miss the year, but I really don't know what's going to happen,'' Welsh said. ''You can see that after the Olympics, the national team is going to be a new team. There are a number of players who will move on. They've done everything they could possibly do, and the Olympics will probably be the last thing for a lot of them.''</p>
        <p>In addition to their matches in the Pacific Cup, the women's team will attend the first-round draw for the Olympics on June 3 at Sydney Town Hall.</p>
        <p>UNITED STATES MEN</p>
        <p>The composition of the World Cup qualifying group in the regional semifinals that includes the United States is three-quarters complete after a series of games last Sunday night.</p>
        <p>Barbados defeated Cuba on penalty kicks to join the United States and Costa Rica in Group E. The final entry in the group will be either Antigua, a loser to St. Vincent, or Guatemala. Their home-and-away total-goals series will be played on June 11 in Antigua and June 17 in Guatemala.</p>
        <p>The senior men's national team and the Olympic team took a bit of a hit this past week when the promising defender Steve Cherundolo tore an anterior cruciate ligament during training with his German club team, Hannover 96. Cherundolo, who was a driving force when the Americans qualified for a trip to Sydney, Australia, will probably be out until Christmas. His play during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Hershey, Pa., in April drew compliments from the national team coach, Bruce Arena, who called him a likely candidate to play in early World Cup qualifying matches in July and beyond. Now he will have to wait.</p>
        <p>MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER</p>
        <p>The debut of Luis Hernandez for the Los Angeles Galaxy on Saturday night drew 40,303 fans to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. The Mexican star did not score in the Galaxy's victory and left midway through the second half with a strained left shoulder. Even before the injury, Hernandez was not scheduled to play in tomorrow's match against San Jose. He is back in Mexico to be with his wife, who is seven months pregnant.</p>
        <p>The Chicago Fire, which plays the MetroStars at Giants Stadium on Saturday night, has lost the services of defender Lubos Kubik for at least a couple of weeks. Kubik injured the medial collateral ligament in his left knee in a loss to New England. Chicago, however, does expect the Bulgarian Hristo Stoitchkov to return to the lineup after overcoming the effects of a groin injury.</p>
        <p>Kansas City goalkeeper Tony Meola is riding a league-record 615-minute streak without having allowed a goal. (He has an 0.36 goals against average.) Meola recorded his ninth shutout of the season, facing only four shots on goal as the the Wizards (9-0-2) defeated San Jose. It was the 50th victory of Meola's M.L.S. career and 30th career shutout, also a league record.</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>England entertains Brazil and Romania plays in the Netherlands tomorrow in warm-up matches for next month's European Championships. The tournament has its excellent Web site (euro2000.org) up and running. In addition to profiles of all the top players in Europe, the site includes streaming video of all of the goals scored in the tournament since 1980. ... Last weekend's F.A. Cup final, won by Chelsea over Aston Villa, was the 72nd and last at Wembley Stadium in London before the so-called cathedral of soccer is demolished and redeveloped on the same site. ... The Iranian international Khodadad Azizi is now playing for San Jose, but the Earthquakes' plans for a friendly match against Azizi's former Iranian club, Persepolis, on May 31 is in jeopardy. According to reports by the official Islamic Republic news agency, the head of the Iranian federation, Hossein Mahlouji, said the trip would be canceled unless United States immigration officials assure the Iranians that the players would not be fingerprinted or photographed upon entry into the United States. ... The American defender Jeff Agoos will earn his 100th cap if he plays against South Africa on June 3 in the Nike U.S. Cup.</p>
