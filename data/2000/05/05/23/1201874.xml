        <p>KWAPICH-Cyrene. The Board of Directors and staff of Little Flower Children's Services of New York mourn the death of Sister Cyrene Kwapich after a long illness. Born and raised in the Polish American Community South Brooklyn, Sister Cyrene entered the congregation of the Holy Family in Philadelphia in 1939. She was a graduate of the Social Services School of Catholic University in Washington. She returned to Little Flower Campus and served as an educator, a social worker, counselor and advocate for the children of New York separted from their families. For years she greeted ''children of the night'' who were in emergency placement, and calmed their fears. Interment will be on May 24, 2000 at 10:00 A.M. at Marion Heights, Monroe, Connecticut. May the good Lord greet and bless her peace, now and always. Mr. Arthur McDermott, President Mrs. Mary G. Ryder, Executive Director Monsignor John Fagan, Executive Vice President, CEO</p>
