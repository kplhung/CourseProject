        <p>Prime Minister Tony Blair, nudged in public by his wife, Cherie, to take some of the paternity leave his government has just authorized for British parents, is canceling his public appearances this week to spend time with her and Leo, their baby son.</p>

        <p>Prime Minister Tony Blair, nudged in public by his wife, Cherie, to take some of the paternity leave his government has just authorized for British parents, is canceling his public appearances this week to spend time with her and Leo, their baby son.</p>
        <p>A 10 Downing Street spokesman said the only appointment Mr. Blair would keep is his weekly session with Queen Elizabeth II on Tuesday. He will leave the handling of prime minister's questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday and the chairing of the Thursday cabinet meeting to his deputy, John Prescott.  Mother, father and newborn son will leave London at midweek for Chequers, the official country retreat in Buckinghamshire where they will be joined for the weekend by the couple's three other children, Euan, 16, Nicky, 14, and Kathryn, 12.</p>
        <p>Downing Street, which has kept a tight lid on publicity surrounding the birth at the Blairs' insistence, released the first picture of the couple and Leo, who was born early Saturday morning. Fourteen more photographs were offered for sale through a London agency with proceeds to go to charities that Mrs. Blair is patron of that deal with children's cancer and breast cancer.  The photos were taken by Mary McCartney, 30, the daughter of the former Beatle, Paul McCartney. Her mother, Linda, who was well known for her photography, died of breast cancer in 1998.</p>
        <p>In March, Mrs. Blair, 45, a noted employment rights lawyer, had praised the Finnish prime minister,  Paavo Lipponen, 59, for taking a week off that month to be with his newborn daughter, and she had pointedly urged the ''widespread adoption of his fine example.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair, 47, said he could not abandon his job, but he promised to devote as much time as he could to the baby and specifically to take up nighttime diaper duty. Noting that pledge, Mr. Blair's press spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said today's decision did not reflect a big shift in  attitude.</p>
