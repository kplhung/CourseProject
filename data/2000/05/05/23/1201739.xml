        <p>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was back at City Hall yesterday, repeating his pledges to reach out to critics, fondling puppies and offering new testimony to the power of love. He also said he would formulate plans about how to pursue his outreach initiative over the next couple of weeks. Some of Mr. Giuliani's critics are reacting with understandable cynicism. But other officials are promising to reciprocate the mayor's gestures. In our view, they are smart to seize the opening presented by Mr. Giuliani's new rhetoric of inclusion. If the mayor and his longtime adversaries work together to render his words into action, a genuine transformation can occur throughout New York City.</p>
        <p>At first, people tended to regard the emotional odyssey of a supposedly arrogant mayor humbled by illness and a recognition of his own domestic frailties as slightly unreal -- like something out of a Frank Capra movie. But now it is clear that the mayor's repeated declarations are having an effect on other officials and on constituency groups.</p>
        <p>The City Council speaker, Peter Vallone, has suggested that the mayor take such steps as dropping efforts to block creation of a civilian oversight board for the Police Department. Members of the City Council have suggested restoration to the mayor's budget of a $750,000 program providing free screenings for prostate and other cancers.</p>
        <p>Going further, the group known as 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement has suggested that the mayor quickly settle a lawsuit filed by the family of Patrick Dorismond, the Haitian-American man killed by a plainclothes police officer outside a bar earlier this year. The law enforcement group also suggested a richly symbolic way for Mr. Giuliani to fulfill his pledge to remove ''barriers'' between him and the public. That would be to remove the physical barriers that hamper reasonable public use of the area around City Hall.</p>
        <p>With his propensity for long, reflective news conferences, Mr. Giuliani has invited New Yorkers to think that the mayor who thrives on confrontation can learn different ways of getting what he wants from other actors on the city's vast stage. By setting a goal and a timetable, Mr. Giuliani has moved the process from its catharsis phase toward a period of policy formulation. The mayor has to take seriously the energies unleashed by his promises, just as his critics ought to seize this opportunity in a constructive and practical spirit.</p>
