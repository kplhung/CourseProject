        <p>In a testy televised debate among the four Republican candidates for the United States Senate, each of the two best-known contenders, Robert Franks and William L.

        <p>In a testy televised debate among the four Republican candidates for the United States Senate, each of the two best-known contenders, Robert Franks and William L. Gormley, sought to position himself as the front-runner by disparaging the other's record on taxes, assault weapons and the impeachment of President Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, a United States representative from Union County, questioned Mr. Gormley's credentials as a Republican because he voted for several tax and spending increases during his 25 years in the State Legislature. Mr. Franks also accused Mr. Gormley of having worked too closely with Jim Florio, the former governor, who is now seeking  the Democratic Senate nomination, and of having accepted campaign donations from several of Mr. Florio's cabinet members.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gormley said he had consistently opposed Mr. Florio's tax increases and accused Mr. Franks of distorting his record.</p>
        <p>''You can't find a vote where I, on taxes, voted for the Florio taxes,'' Mr. Gormley said. ''Your problem is, you're using innuendo. You can't find a real vote and that's a shame.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gormley, a state senator from Atlantic County, countered by raising doubts about Mr. Franks's political courage. Mr. Gormley said Mr. Franks, as a state legislator, failed to vote three times on New Jersey's assault weapons ban. As a congressman, Mr. Franks voted to impeach Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gormley said, but 48 hours later wrote a letter to the Senate asking that the president not be removed from office.</p>
        <p>''As Yogi Berra once said, you came to a fork in the road and you took it,'' Mr. Gormley said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks explained his absence from the first vote on the assault weapons ban by saying that he was attending a seminar in Taiwan, and noted that he had ultimately voted for a bill that banned the weapons without confiscating guns from owners who had purchased them legally. He did not explain his absences from the other votes. Mr. Franks also belittled Mr. Gormley for failing to speak out about the president's impeachment as a state legislator and for raising the issue only when he turned his political ambitions to the United States Senate seat.</p>
        <p>''While you were home watching the debate on C-Span, I was casting the toughest vote of my political career,'' Mr. Franks said.</p>
        <p>The combative tone of tonight's debate, which was sponsored by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University and The Star-Ledger of Newark, was a drastic departure from the Republicans' first encounter on May 8, which was so genial that the candidates barely mentioned each other's names.</p>
        <p>The debate, the second to feature Republican candidates, offered the first opportunity for candidates from either major party to directly question each other. And after fielding questions from reporters and audience members for 30 minutes, Mr.  Franks and Mr. Gormley wasted no time attacking each other's records.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, the former state party chairman, hopes that his support from Republican county organizations will allow him to compensate for Mr. Gormley's advantage in financing. Mr. Gormley, who began running network television ads last week, has a solid base in South Jersey and is hoping to increase his name recognition in the state's more densely populated north.</p>
        <p>During the first half of the debate, candidates were asked questions by a panel of journalists but were not given the opportunity to respond to one another, giving the encounter the feel of a quiz show rather than a clash of political adversaries.</p>
        <p>Another Republican Senate candidate, James W. Treffinger, the Essex County executive, remained on the sidelines during most of the tussling between Mr. Franks and Mr. Gormley. Mr. Treffinger portrayed himself as the candidate best able to bring a conservative Republican agenda to working people, and boasted that he had eliminated the county's $162 million budget deficit and cut its welfare rolls in half.</p>
        <p>Mr. Treffinger also said he would scrap the tax code, reform the Internal Revenue Service and replace the current tax system with a flat tax.</p>
        <p>The debate's most surprising moment came from Murray Sabrin, a Ramapo College professor who ran as a Libertarian candidate for governor in 1997 and is now seeking the Republican Senate nomination.</p>
        <p>Responding to a question about open space and private property rights, Mr. Sabrin distinguished himself from his opponents -- and, according to most public opinion polls, from the majority of New Jersey voters -- by saying he was in favor of suburban sprawl.</p>
        <p>''When people see sprawl they see problems,'' Mr. Sabrin said. ''I see prosperity because it means more jobs, more opportunity for people to buy houses.''</p>
