        <p>E. Scott Garrett was a little-known Republican state assemblyman until two years ago when his primary challenge nearly unseated Representative Marge Roukema, the incumbent in New Jersey's Fifth Congressional District.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Garrett is taking on Mrs. Roukema again, and this time he has brought some friends to the fight. The Club for Growth, an organization of wealthy Republican conservatives who loathe Mrs. Roukema's moderate stand on abortion, welfare reform and tax issues, are piling money into Mr. Garrett's campaign for the June 6 primary, making the fight for the Fifth District into a national test of party conservatives' ability to purge Congress of Republicans they consider too liberal.</p>
        <p>By Primary Day, Mr. Garrett will have received about $150,000 in direct donations, and the Club for Growth will provide ''a couple hundred thousand'' in soft money contributions, said Stephen Moore, president of the group. The money, Mr. Moore said, is intended to send a message to other Republican moderates in Congress.</p>
        <p>''I look at this as a really big race for the conservative movement,'' Mr. Moore said. ''Next to the presidential race, this could be the second most important race, because if Roukema loses, or I should say, if Garrett wins, it would send shock waves through Congress. All 25 or so liberal Republican members are watching this, and they will be terrified if Garrett wins this race.''</p>
        <p>The Fifth District, reaching across northern New Jersey like an inverted V along the angle formed by the Delaware River and the New York line, takes in all of Warren County and parts of Bergen, Passaic and Sussex Counties. Mr. Garrett, 40, of Wantage, has represented Sussex, Hunterdon and Warren Counties in the State Assembly since 1990, in an Assembly district that includes most of the Congressional district's rural but rapidly suburbanizing western reaches. He is sharply anti-abortion and a supporter of the flat tax movement, a position that helped win an endorsement from Steve Forbes, the former presidential contender. But he has made the incumbent his main issue, accusing her of acting too much like a Democrat.</p>
        <p>''When Hillary Clinton failed to get her giant health bill through, she said, 'Maybe we can do it incrementally,' '' Mr. Garrett said in an interview. ''That is what moderates like the incumbent in this district have been doing: pushing incrementally on all the things the Democrats could not do all at once.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Roukema, 70, of Ridgewood, has held her seat for 20 years and is strongest in the more populous Bergen County portion of the district. Her politics reflect the moderate suburban Republican outlook of much of northern Bergen's commuter population: she is for abortion rights, she resisted some of the harsher aspects of welfare reform, and she sponsored the Family and Medical Leave Act that President Bush vetoed and President Clinton signed. Mrs. Roukema has won middle-of-the-road scores from Congressional watchdog groups on taxation and spending issues, and she reminds her constituents that she is next in line for the chairmanship of the House Banking Committee, if she wins re-election and the Republicans retain control of Congress.</p>
        <p>''He's not a conservative, he's extreme right wing,'' Mrs. Roukema said of Mr. Garrett in an interview. Her supporters maintain that Mr. Garrett is too conservative for the district, and that a win by him in the primary would tip the district to the Democrat, Linda Mercurio, who has no primary opponent.</p>
        <p>Yet the Fifth is one of only two New Jersey Congressional districts that supported Bob Dole in 1996, a fact that Mr. Garrett cites to back his view that the district is ready for a more conservative Republican.</p>
        <p>The Club for Growth's polls show Mrs. Roukema ahead of Mr. Garrett, Mr. Moore said, but Mr. Garrett is using the money he has raised to get out the vote in Passaic, Sussex and Warren Counties, which are growing quickly as families move from suburbs closer to New York City. He won all three outlying counties in his race against Mrs. Roukema in 1998, and he is hardly alone in thinking that, as those families move west, they also move to the right politically.</p>
        <p>''We have a lot of people moving here from the inner city in Bergen County,'' said Don R. Kelley, the Warren County sheriff and a leading Republican, displaying a rural view of the suburbs to the east. ''And they move out here for our conservative values in the schools and in our whole atmosphere.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Roukema dismisses Mr. Garrett's strong showing in the 1998 primary as a combination of flukes. He drew heavily from single-issue voters concerned with abortion and gun control in a low-turnout primary, she said, and he benefited from a lackadaisical attitude among her own supporters in Bergen County.</p>
        <p>''My supporters said, 'Oh, Marge always has these primaries and she always wins,' '' the congresswoman said. ''This time, we are going to make sure they get out and vote.'' Turnout is likely to be higher than the 30,000 votes counted in 1998 because of the race for New Jersey's open United States Senate seat.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Roukema has the support of her party's Congressional leadership and the endorsements of the party chairman of every county touched by her district. She has a very strong  base in the party leadership in the  district, and has raised nearly $500,000 so far.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 24, 2000, Wednesday  An article yesterday about the Republican primary in New Jersey for the Fifth District seat held by Representative Marge Roukema omitted clarification for an imprecise reference by her opponent, E. Scott Garrett. His comment read, ''When Hillary Clinton failed to get her giant health bill through, she said, 'Maybe we can do it incrementally.' '' By ''she,'' Mr. Garrett meant Mrs. Clinton -- not Mrs. Roukema, who opposed the Clinton plan.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 9, 2000, Friday  An article on May 23 about the Republican primary in New Jersey for the seat held by Representative Marge S. Roukema misstated the criticism leveled at her by the Club for Growth, a conservative group based in Washington. (The error was repeated in an article in some copies on Wednesday.) While the organization has objected to Mrs. Roukema's moderate stands on welfare reform and tax issues, it has not criticized her for supporting abortion rights; it takes no position on social issues.</p>
