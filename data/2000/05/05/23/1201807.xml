        <p>Rising competition in Singapore's deregulated telecommunications industry contributed to a 5.3 percent decline in the fiscal-year profits of Singapore Telecommunications Ltd., the former monopoly still controlled by the government. The decline, to 1.85 billion Singapore dollars or about $1.1 billion, had been expected. Despite two failed attempts to expand overseas by taking stakes in Cable and Wireless HKT Ltd. and Time Engineering of Malaysia, SingTel said contributions from foreign investments grew 26 percent, accounting for 15 percent of pretax profit.</p>
