        <p>He was boasting, once again, about New York City's war on graffiti and street litter. He proclaimed -- somewhat belatedly -- May as Pet Adoption Month. And by yesterday evening, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was out on Gracie Mansion's front lawn, holding a party for the city's theater community, complete with a performance by a star of ''The Lion King.''</p>
        <p>There was no mistaking it yesterday. Candidate Rudy is out. And Mayor Rudy is back in, and so far is sticking with his promised kinder, gentler style.</p>
        <p>For the retired Senate candidate, this all was somewhat of a relief, as he let Rick A. Lazio, his apparent replacement, dash madly across  New York State. The mayor stayed on home turf yesterday, tending to the details of running his favorite city and looking for yet more opportunities to use his new favorite word, ''love.''</p>
        <p>''It is great. It is great. I love being the mayor,'' Mr. Giuliani said at a morning news conference that attracted a dozen television cameras, compared with the mosh pit of more than 40 when he announced his exit from the Senate race on Friday. ''That is one of the benefits, one of the bright sides, as I said on Friday, of all that happened with health and everything. I love doing this job. This is a great job, a very rewarding job, a terrific job, and I found new reasons to love the city of New York.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani deferred all questions about political matters. No decision, he said, on what he would do with his millions in unspent campaign money. No decision on whether he would attend the May 30 Republican convention in Buffalo, where he was until Friday set to become the Senate nominee. No thoughts yet about his future when his second term as mayor runs out in 18 months. And no word on if he has hired a lawyer to represent him in his planned separation from his wife, Donna Hanover.</p>
        <p>When a reporter asked how he felt about beginning his ''first week as a real lame-duck mayor,'' Mr. Giuliani laughed and responded, ''I feel pretty good.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the mayor spent the day on classic municipal affairs. He gave an early morning speech at the Grand Hyatt hotel to corporate leaders, surveying the progress the city has made in recent years to reduce  crime and clean up the streets and sidewalks.</p>
        <p>During the event, the mayor shared a table with his former director of communications, Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas, who is now the president of NYC &amp; Company, the city's convention and visitors bureau. It was the first public meeting of the two since Ms. Hanover implied that the mayor and Ms. Lategano-Nicholas had a romantic relationship when she worked for the mayor, a suggestion the two denied.</p>
        <p>Back at City Hall, the mayor fondled two whimpering puppies as he announced a stepped-up effort by the city's Center for Animal Care and Control to find adoptive homes for strays.</p>
        <p>Finally, yesterday evening, he was the host as several hundreds guests attended the city's annual ''Salute to the Theater'' under a tent on the Gracie Mansion lawn.</p>
        <p>The mayor spoke about the progress in rebuilding Times Square, including the soon-to-open Madame Tussaud's wax museum. ''Madame Tussaud is soon to be there with, among other things, my wax figure,'' he said, pausing and stiffly imitating his replica. ''It looks better than me.''</p>
        <p>In the coming weeks, perhaps the top item on the mayor's city government agenda will be ironing out a budget agreement with the City Council. Formal negotiations will begin this week, with the two sides split over competing tax cut proposals. Negotiations are also under way with municipal labor unions representing almost all city workers, whose contracts expire soon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani indicated that it would most likely be about two weeks before he decided, in detail, how he would follow up on his promise on Friday to reach out to disaffected city residents, presumably from predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods. He also has said he intended to in some way express his condolences to the family of Patrick Dorismond, the Haitian-American killed by a police officer during a confrontation in March.</p>
        <p>There were other hints yesterday that Mr. Giuliani was sustaining his new image as a more sensitive, compassionate mayor.</p>
        <p>Before last night's party, he quietly left City Hall to visit a sick teen-age girl at Ronald McDonald House of New York City, which provides support for the families of children  being treated for cancer and other serious diseases. Her family had asked for a signed photograph of the mayor; he decided to deliver that picture in person.</p>
        <p>Regarding his own health, the mayor said yesterday that he may not immediately announce when he had settled on a treatment for his prostate cancer, waiting instead until the care might require him to  miss some work. Until Friday, the mayor had been under pressure to make his treatment choices quickly, saying he wanted to decide on the medical matters before indicating if he would stay in the Senate race.</p>
        <p>''I am going to keep that decision to myself and then announce it when I think it might have some impact on what I do as mayor,'' he said. ''In other words where I will have to take some time off, or take a few days off, or a period of time off, as soon I know that, everybody has a right to know that.''</p>
