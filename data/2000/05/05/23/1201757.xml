        <p>Neil L. Rudenstine, a scholar of Renaissance poetry who recently led the largest fund-raising campaign in the history of higher education, announced yesterday that he would step down next spring after a decade as president of Harvard University.</p>
        <p>After startling his colleagues in 1994 with a three-month leave of absence because of exhaustion, Mr. Rudenstine won wide praise on the Harvard campus for uniting its historically disparate deans, and he has been a fervent supporter of affirmative action. Undergraduates, however, often found him remote, and some in higher education believe he failed to exploit fully the platform afforded the steward of the nation's oldest and most prestigious university.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rudenstine, 65, said that he was unsure of his plans but that he saw this as an apt moment to retire, as the institution of 18,000 students and 2,000 professors embarks on a new era of strategic planning and, inevitably, another capital campaign. More broadly, Mr. Rudenstine said he believed that the information technology revolution and globalization of the economy heralded a tectonic shift in academia, akin to the switch from small colleges to large research universities at the turn of the century and the vastly expanded access to higher education after World War II.</p>
        <p>''The totality of the institution will be a different configuration,'' he said on Saturday in an interview in the library of the president's residence. ''That ought to be a challenge for some people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rudenstine is a rare combination of prodigious fund-raiser and scholar. From the poetry and music performed at his 1991 inauguration to his personal oversight of more than 250 tenure appointments, his intellectual acuity was always on display. Yet his legacy is most clearly etched in Harvard's bank accounts; he raised $2.6 billion -- more than $1 million a day -- over six years from some 175,000 people.</p>
        <p>Many believe it was Mr. Rudenstine's earnest commitment to Harvard's academic future that pushed so many donors' hands deeper into their pockets.</p>
        <p>''One of the strongest factors in philanthropy in general is that people give to people, as well as institutions,'' said William H. Boardman, a top Harvard administrator who traveled with Mr. Rudenstine as he met with more than 500 potential donors.</p>
        <p>Typical, Mr. Boardman said, was the reaction of the late John L. Loeb, who said after meeting the president in the early 1990's, ''I spent a half hour with Neil Rudenstine and I felt like I've known him all my life.'' (Mr. Loeb gave $72 million in the campaign.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Rudenstine installed the first provost, or universitywide academic officer, in Harvard's modern history, trying to overcome the traditional autonomy of its 12 schools. Through monthly meetings of a council of deans, he encouraged unified approaches to institutional issues and cross-fertilization among the faculty on topics like the environment, the brain, Latin America and East Asia.</p>
        <p>''Harvard has this tradition of every tub on its own bottom,'' said Joseph Nye, dean of the Kennedy School of Government. ''In the past, that has meant that the sum of the university is not greater than its parts. What Neil has been good at is getting the parts to work together so the sum total is greater.''</p>
        <p>Renowned for prolific handwritten notes, Mr. Rudenstine has a humble, often rumpled persona, and often ran late for appointments (His leave, in 1994, began when he slept through a series of appointments in New York.) While he counts among his most memorable moments encounters with students, undergraduates said they rarely saw him between a welcome handshake freshman year and commencement.</p>
        <p>''You could go through the rest of your time here and never see him in the yard,'' said Fentrice Driskell, a junior who is president of the undergraduate council.</p>
        <p>Alan E. Wirzbicki, president of The Crimson, the university newspaper, said Mr. Rudenstine ''was clearly a brilliant fund-raiser, but to most students, that's all he was, Harvard's fund-raiser.''</p>
        <p>Nationally, Mr. Rudenstine has been a quiet leader among his peers, though he has spoken boldly about the importance of affirmative action, first through a 62-page report in defense of diversity, and, in 1997, gathering a coalition of university presidents to adopt a resolution supporting the use of affirmative action in admissions.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Harvard doubled the number of women on its faculty, to 183 from 85, and assembled a dream team of scholars in its Afro-American Studies Department.</p>
        <p>Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the Afro-American Studies Department, recalled when Mr. Rudenstine was first appointed and, over lunch, urged him to write a list of his ''ideal department -- even if they're impossible to recruit.'' Mr. Gates jotted down William Julius Wilson, Cornel West, Lani Guinier, Jamaica Kincaid and Kwame Anthony Appiah.</p>
        <p>''He looked at me and said go for it -- and we hired all these people,'' Mr. Gates said. ''There were all these people who theorized about multiculturalism -- there were very few administrators who were able to envision that theory and to implement it.''</p>
