        <p>The consolidation of the business-to-business software market accelerated today with two big deals. The Vignette Corporation said it was acquiring OnDisplay Inc. in a $1.7 billion stock swap, while WebMethods Inc. is buying Active Software Inc. in a stock deal valued at $1.3 billion.</p>

        <p>The consolidation of the business-to-business software market accelerated today with two big deals. The Vignette Corporation said it was acquiring OnDisplay Inc. in a $1.7 billion stock swap, while WebMethods Inc. is buying Active Software Inc. in a stock deal valued at $1.3 billion.</p>
        <p>The four companies specialize in software that seeks to integrate business processes within companies or transactions between companies. Because this task requires multiple capabilities, analysts say there will be more such mergers as competitors strive to offer a complete package. Although most of the companies pursuing this market are small start-ups, I.B.M., Microsoft, Oracle and other heavyweights have indicated they will have competing offerings.</p>
        <p>''As B-to-B technology matures and advances, customers are asking more of each individual vendor,'' said Clark Spurrier, a principal with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which advised both Vignette and WebMethods. ''This is not just layering and added functionality. It's expanding into new product categories.''</p>
        <p>Shares of Vignette fell $8.9375, to $34.875, while OnDisplay rose 87.5 cents, to $54.125. WebMethods fell $15, to $72, and Active Software dropped 93.75 cents, to $32.0625, all on Nasdaq. Analysts said the shares were caught in the early technology sell-off but that the mergers made sense.</p>
        <p>Vignette, which is based in Austin, Tex., sells a suite of applications called V/5, designed to allow companies to personalize individuals' interactions with their Web-based systems. OnDisplay, based in San Ramon, Calif., offers software that allows business information like purchase orders, inventory status checks, invoices and product catalog data to be integrated and exchanged among suppliers and distribution partners.</p>
        <p>Vignette will swap 1.58 shares for each share of OnDisplay, valuing the company at $69.22 a share. Based on Friday's closing price, that is a 30 percent premium.</p>
        <p>''Our customers increasingly require coordination between enterprise systems, suppliers and multiple online marketplaces,'' Greg Peters, Vignette's president and chief executive, said in a statement. ''The acquisition of OnDisplay furthers Vignette's stated mission to provide the broadest and deepest application platform to support the needs of companies who are serious about building businesses online.''</p>
        <p>WebMethods, based in Fairfax, Va., makes software that allows the computer systems of a company to communicate with systems of the company's suppliers and customers. Active Software, based in Santa Clara, Calif., makes software that integrates a company's internal computer systems, like order management and accounting, to communicate with each other and run together. WebMethods and Active have worked together at high-profile customers like Federal Express, Juniper Networks and Hewlett-Packard.</p>
        <p>Under the deal, Active Software's shareholders will receive 0.527 share of WebMethods for each Active Software share. Based on WebMethods' close of $87 a share on Friday, the deal values Active Software's shares at $45.85, a 39 percent premium.</p>
        <p>Dan Scholler, an analyst with Meta Group, said that customers increasingly wanted their enterprise application integration software, the domain of Active, to mesh seamlessly with their business-to-business integration software, or B2BI, the domain of WebMethods.</p>
        <p>''Ultimately these things are going to drive together as the infrastructure vendors start to deliver the platform technology on which a business can build its e-presence,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Simon Yates, an analyst with Forrester Research, said that because these two deals happened at the same time, ''what looked clever yesterday has landed Vignette in a bind today.''</p>
        <p>''With this deal,'' he said, ''Vignette has thrown down the gauntlet to commerce-platform competitors like Open Market and BroadVision to develop a system-to-system commerce story of their own.'' Many of those companies had already formed partnerships with Active, and now get WebMethods as part of the package. WebMethods ''is now stronger than OnDisplay,'' he said.</p>
