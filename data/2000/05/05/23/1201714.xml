        <p>SOUTH KOREA: NEW PREMIER  President Kim Dae Jung picked a conservative minority party leader as prime minister, a move expected to significantly widen his political base. The appointment of Lee Han Dong, 65, head of the United Liberal Democrats, left, is subject to approval by the 273-member National Assembly, which is expected to give its consent. Mr. Lee succeeds Park Tae Joon, who resigned in a tax evasion scandal. He is the third prime minister to serve in the Kim government, which was inaugurated in early 1998.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: PAPER BANNED  In a continuing crackdown on its free press, the government has banned The Sunday Leader for violating censorship laws. Rigorous restrictions on reporting the news have been put in place as the army attempts to fight off a critical campaign for the Jaffna Peninsula by the Tamil Tiger rebels.</p>

        <p>KASHMIR: SEPARATISTS CRY MURDER  Muslim separatist leaders have called for a three-day hunger strike to protest what they say is the murder of prisoners by state authorities. There have been 67 custodial killings since early January, the separatists say. India has often denied that the abuses take place in such high numbers.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: NEW SUHARTO PROTEST  Prosecutors investigating corruption charges cut short the questioning of former President Suharto, 79, because of what they said was his failing health, setting off a demonstration by hundreds of students demanding that he be out on trial. Students chanted ''Suharto on trial!'' while hundreds of policemen stood guard near Mr. Suharto's home.</p>

        <p>PHILIPPINES: REBELS SHUN TALKS  Rebels failed to show up for talks on releasing nearly two dozen Western and Asian hostages kidnapped on Sipadan island, saying they were wary of the heavily armed escort taking the Philippine negotiator to the jungle meeting place. The chief negotiator, Robert Aventajado, waited more than four hours surrounded by an elite team of 10 presidential guards with assault weapons, and 500 police officers backed by armored personnel carriers. Troops lined the highway to the village.</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>FRANCE: STORM ON 'NAZI' REMARK  Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement has apologized for saying Germany had not yet been ''cured'' of its Nazi past. The remark in a television interview caused a political storm, with French politicians from a range of parties denouncing the leftist and often outspoken minister, who was discussing a German proposal for restructuring the European Union. Mr. Chevenement said the proposal showed that deep down, Germany ''is still dreaming of the Holy Roman Empire,'' adding, ''It hasn't cured itself of its past derailment into Nazism.''</p>

        <p>FRANCE: CASH STRIKE CONTINUES  A two-week old strike of armored truck security guards that has left thousands of automatic teller machines without cash is likely to continue for a while. The strikers rejected a settlement proposal after 20 hours of talks. Special measures have been put in place allowing banks to replenish automatic tellers on their own. But many machines remain empty.</p>

        <p>SERBIA: 143 KOSOVARS SENTENCED  A court in Nis sentenced 143 Kosovo Albanians to prison terms ranging from 7 to 13 years for terrorism, in the biggest mass trial of people arrested during the NATO air campaign last year. The men, among them two minors, denied the charges and said they were rounded up arbitrarily in the town of Djakovica.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: MILLENNIUM DOME'S TROUBLES  Five months after it opened, the troubled Millennium Dome secured a loan of $45 million in National Lottery funds to avoid bankruptcy and early closing. The attraction by the River Thames has already received some $800 million in public funding, but has been unable to draw the crowds to pay its own way. The dome's management says it expects between 6 and 7 million visitors this year, compared with an initial forecast of 12 million.</p>

        <p>TURKEY: OCALAN REPORTED AILING  The health of the imprisoned Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan is ''rapidly deteriorating,'' his brother Osman said. He said the prisoner has trouble breathing and has lost his senses of smell and taste because he is kept in a damp and stuffy cell 22 hours a day. He warned of ''serious agitation'' if Turkish officials do not take steps to restore his brother's health.</p>

        <p>TURKEY: IRAN TIES WORSEN  Relations between Turkey and neighboring Iran worsened in the wake of charges that Iranian militants may have been responsible for the killings of several secular Turks. Iran protested the arrest of many Iranians in ''violent and orchestrated'' raids in Turkey. Iran is among the most orthodox Muslim countries, while Turkey is among the most tolerant.</p>

        <p>PARAGUAY: 70 HELD IN COUP BID  More than 70 people, mostly military and police officers, have been arrested and many others, including the local correspondent of Agence France-Presse and two radio station owners, are facing criminal charges on suspicion that they were involved in a failed coup attempt early Friday. President Luis Gonzalez Macchi ordered the roundup under emergency powers granted him by Congress, but Gen. Lino Oviedo, the former army chief who the coup plotters supported, remains at large.</p>

        <p>CANADA: BORDER MOVE HAILED  Canada has hailed a Clinton administration move to change a law that would have required recording the names of all people crossing the United States-Canada border. Canadians and legislators from American border states feared that the 1996 provision, which has never been put put into effect, would cause huge traffic delays at the border. Every day $1 billion worth of goods cross the border and every year 200 million people make the crossing.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: TV DEBATE IN DOUBT  The second of two nationally broadcast debates, scheduled to bring the three leading presidential candidates for the July 2 balloting together today, has been thrown into doubt. After rancorous negotiations, the candidates canceled the encounter and blamed each other for the collapse. But leaders urged the candidates to seek agreement on a format, and talks were continuing.</p>

        <p>ZIMBABWE: ELECTION DOUBTS  Zimbabwe is not ready to hold free and fair elections next month after a campaign of violence, misinformation and political intimidation, said a Washington-based observer group. ''The conditions for credible democratic elections do not exist in Zimbabwe at this time,'' the head of the National Democratic Institute's mission, Alex Ekwueme, abive, said in Harare.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>IRAN: STUDENTS PROTEST  About 3,000 student demonstrators accused the hard-line Guardian Council of tampering with parliamentary election results, joining a barrage of criticism from reformist politicians and the news media. Reformists hailed the February election as the freest and fairest since the 1979 Islamic revolution. But the head of the council, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, said there had been widespread fraud.</p>

        <p>IRAQ: U.S. BOMBING  Iraq said one person was wounded when Western planes attacked in the south and the north. In Berlin, the European Central Command said American jets bombed air defenses after coming under fire while patrolling a no-flight zone in the north, the sixth such incident this month. The statement did not mention any attack in the south.</p>
