Wonderful husband of Phyllis; cherished father of Hank (Sara), Mike (Deb), and Maggie (Rakesh); doting grandfather of Jill, Marc, Matt, Greg, and Abby. Respected attorney, teacher, and lecturer; distinguished Marine Corps officer; dedicated volunteer Special Olympics coach; and trusted friend to many.

Friends and colleagues are invited to visit the family's home at 20 Priory Lane, Pelham Manor, NY on Tuesday from 5-9 PM, and Wednesday from 2-5 PM and 6-9 PM. Larry would have appreciated gifts in his memory to benefit the athletes he so enjoyed sharing time with at Manhattan Special Olympics, c/o Jean Pine, 7410 35th Ave, Jackson Heights, NY 11372.</p>
        <p>BANGSER-Lawrence S. The partners, counsel, associates and staff of Bangser Klein Rocca and Blum, LLP, mourn the loss of our friend, counsel and former partner. We are proud to have had him as our role model and as our leader for much of the 52 years we practised law together. He had great courage, strength, vitality and judgement. We will sorely miss him. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to his wife, Phyllis, his children, Hank, Mike and Maggie, and their families.</p>
