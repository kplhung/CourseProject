        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Return of the Native Executive'' (Business Day, May 17), you refer to the million-dollar loss that occurs when an executive returning home from foreign postings suddenly leaves his company. In fact, the cost to companies of such returnees is much higher.</p>
        <p>Today, when most companies see their greatest growth in the international arena, and when effective globalization is critical to the life of any organization, losing the human resource talent that is most skilled in global issues represents much more than the loss of the million dollars it cost the company to send an executive overseas: it represents the failure of the organization to truly become a global one.</p>
        <p>DEAN FOSTER  New York, May 17, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is senior vice president, intercultural services, at Windham International.</p>
