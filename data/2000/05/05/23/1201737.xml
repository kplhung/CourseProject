        <p>Hot flashes were quickly eased in frequency and severity by relatively small amounts of antidepressant drugs among women with breast cancer, a researcher said today at the meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology here.</p>
        <p>Breast cancer patients often complain of debilitating hot flashes from early menopause induced by chemotherapy.</p>
        <p>The apparent new use for antidepressants presumably will also benefit women suffering hot flashes during menopause and men who suffer hot flashes during hormonal therapy for prostate cancer, said the researcher, Dr. Charles L. Loprinzi of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.</p>
        <p>Although hormones known as estrogens and progesterones can relieve hot flashes, many doctors shy away from prescribing them for women with breast cancer because of concerns that hormones may stimulate the growth of malignant tumors.</p>
        <p>Hot flashes can disrupt sleep and work performance and come as night sweats. They can also be part of mood swings.</p>
        <p>There are now three studies that show the benefit of antidepressants on hot flashes.</p>
        <p>Because the antidepressant drugs ''so clearly work and are reasonably tolerated,'' they may offer an effective alternative for women who do not want to take hormones, Dr. Loprinzi said at the meeting. However, Dr. Loprinzi said the antidepressants did not completely relieve hot flashes in every woman.</p>
        <p>The drugs were effective in smaller amounts than are used in treating depression, said Dr. Loprinzi, who has conducted two of the studies. They involved two common antidepressants, Prozac and Effexor, that are selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, or S.S.R.I.'s.</p>
        <p>In March, researchers from Georgetown University reported a similar benefit in a third study among 27 women using Paxil, also an S.S.R.I., Dr. Loprinzi said. In the pilot study from Georgetown in Washington, the women kept diaries of the frequency and severity of hot flashes while they took increasing amounts of Paxil for six weeks. The women also completed questionnaires. All women knew they were taking Paxil.</p>
        <p>The two studies with Prozac and Effexor were scientifically more rigorous because neither the women nor the doctors knew what drug the women were taking, Dr. Loprinzi said.</p>
        <p>The idea for this use of antidepressants came from anecdotal observations among women who reported unexpected improvement in their hot flashes while they were taking the drugs to fight depression.</p>
        <p>The study reported today was the largest of the three, involving 229 women who were divided into four groups, Dr. Loprinzi said. The federally funded study began when all women kept a diary of their hot flashes for one week.</p>
        <p>Then the women took pills for four weeks. Three groups took different doses of Effexor -- either the full dose, 150 milligrams, used in treating depression, the half dose, 75 milligrams, or the quarter dose, 37.5 milligrams. A fourth group received a placebo, or dummy pill.</p>
        <p>The half dose seemed to be the most effective and best tolerated in easing hot flashes, Dr. Loprinzi said. In this group, Effexor reduced hot flashes by 61 percent, compared with the number of hot flashes they had before the study began.</p>
        <p>A small number of participants experienced nausea, dry mouth and a decreased appetite. None reported such common side effects associated with use of the antidepressants as diminished libido, dizziness or nervousness, Dr. Loprinzi said.</p>
        <p>Precisely how the drugs ease hot flashes is not known, he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Loprinzi said researchers elsewhere are conducting a fourth study, which has not been reported, involving the antidepressant Zoloft.</p>
        <p>In a separate report, a large Canadian study found that a shorter course of radiation following a lumpectomy for early stage breast cancer is as effective as a standard longer regimen. The shorter, three-week course of daily radiation gives higher doses. The standard daily five-week course gives lower doses.</p>
        <p>It was the first large, rigorous, scientifically controlled study of the length of radiation after a lumpectomy in women who had no evidence of the spread of breast cancer to the lymph nodes, said Dr. Timothy Whelan of the Hamilton Regional Cancer Center in Ontario.</p>
        <p>The study reflects debate between two groups: one, the Canadian and European doctors, who believe the shorter course is as effective and can save scarce health resources, and a second group, American doctors, who favor the longer course.</p>
        <p>The study, of 1,234 women in 10 cancer centers in Canada, began in April 1993. Half the group received the three-week course of radiation, and half the five-week course. Overall survival was the same in both groups. The rate of local cancer recurrence in the breast was 2.5 percent among women who had the shorter course and 3.3 percent among those with the longer course.</p>
        <p>In commenting on the Canadian paper, Dr. Jay Harris, a Harvard radiation oncologist, said the research was of high quality. But he urged caution in changing practices in the United States. He said no change should occur until more time had passed to assure that late complications like heart attacks did not appear after five years and until the completion of a separate British study that will continue longer than the Canadian one.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Harris said the findings would be applicable to Britain and Canada, where radiation therapy is more restricted because of a lack of facilities.</p>
