        <p>A 71-year-old actor known for dozens of Off Broadway roles was struck and killed yesterday by a double-decker bus operated by New York Apple Tours, which for years has been criticized for flouting regulations and disrupting residential neighborhoods, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police said the driver did not have a license to operate the bus and struck the victim, Randolph Walker, as he turned onto a residential street where the bus was not allowed.</p>
        <p>The bus had a green light and was turning west from Ninth Avenue onto 45th Street about 2 p.m. when it hit Mr. Walker, who was walking to his home on West 43rd Street from an audition. Mr. Walker, who was  crossing 45th Street and had the right of way, was pronounced dead at St. Clare's Hospital, the police said.</p>
        <p>The driver of the bus, Howard Scott, 41, was issued a summons because his commercial license does not allow him to drive a bus, said Deputy Inspector Donald Feser, commander of the Manhattan Traffic Task Force. No tourists were on the bus, the police said, but Mr. Scott was accompanied by a tour guide.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scott also was cited for traveling on 45th Street. Inspector Feser said buses are allowed to use side streets only to reach a specific destination requiring such a route. Inspector Feser said Mr. Scott could have avoided 45th.</p>
        <p>An investigator said of Mr. Scott's record: ''He's clean. He's not suspended.''</p>
        <p>The police also issued two summonses to Apple Tours, one because Mr. Scott was driving without the proper license and the other for allowing Mr. Scott to operate the vehicle without a seat belt.</p>
        <p>The accident set off outcries from residents, local lawmakers and advocates for pedestrians, who have contended for years that Apple Tours' distinctive red buses are a hazard. In the last four years, four pedestrians have been struck and injured by buses run by the tour operator, said the City Department of Consumer Affairs.</p>
        <p>''They've polluted the air, they've antagonized the communities they work in, and now they've killed someone,'' said John Kaehny, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, a watchdog group. ''And that's about as bad a corporate neighbor as you can be.''</p>
        <p>City Councilwoman Christine Quinn, who represents the neighborhood where the accident took place, called for the city to suspend Apple Tours' operating license.</p>
        <p>''People have been complaining about New York Apple Tours forever -- that they disregard the law, idling laws, that they drive recklessly,'' said Ms. Quinn, standing at the corner where Mr. Walker had been hit. ''We don't want to regulate them. We  want them closed down. We want the city to immediately suspend this operation.''</p>
        <p>The Department of Consumer Affairs issued a strongly worded statement saying that for a month, it had been seeking to have the company's license revoked in a hearing before an administrative law judge.</p>
        <p>The department cited evidence that the company had falsified the records for the double-decker buses it imports from Britain, and that it had sidestepped United States Customs regulations and emissions standards.</p>
        <p>The agency also said drivers for Apple Tours had been issued 1,400 summonses for traffic violations, many for reckless driving.</p>
        <p>Hayim Grant, the president of Apple Tours, would not comment yesterday. A press release issued for Apple Tours by its public relations agency, Rubenstein Associates, said that it was ''saddened to hear of the tragic accident'' and promised that the company would ''cooperate fully with any further police investigation.''</p>
        <p>In the neighborhood where the accident occurred, residents said they were upset to hear of the death of Mr. Walker, who spent much of his time on nearby streets and lived in a building filled with theater people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker was an actor in his youth, but left the theater for 20 years to work in a bank and support his wife and children, said his brother, Gerard Walker.</p>
        <p>After Randolph Walker and his wife divorced in the 1970's, he returned to acting. Most of his roles were in Off Broadway plays or dinner theater revivals, but Mr. Walker also had a minor role in a 1977 Broadway revival of ''The King and I,'' said his brother. Last month, he had the lead role in a drama, ''Taking Sides,'' playing the German conductor Wilhelm Furtwangler, who was accused of Nazi war crimes.</p>
        <p>''It was one of the first dramatic roles where he really felt into and could do the part and loved the part,'' Gerard Walker said. ''I'm so pleased that when he died, he had that moment of glory very recently behind him.''</p>
        <p>On the street where Mr. Walker died, meanwhile, residents gathered yesterday afternoon under a light rain and said they had long feared that an Apple Tours bus would hit someone.</p>
        <p>''Basically, you step off the curb and you take your life in your hands  with Apple Tours,'' said Adam Honigman, who lives on 55th Street.</p>
        <p>Jean-Daniel Noland, president of the block association for West 47th and West 48th Streets, said that residents were entitled to safer streets although the area is crowded with businesses and truck and bus traffic.</p>
        <p>''In any small town in America -- as we are -- this would be intolerable,'' Mr. Noland said of the ubiquitous tour buses.</p>
        <p>Judy Shotwell, who lives on 51st Street, said she was tired of all the tour bus companies. ''They come here like they own us,'' she said, ''and they do.''</p>
        <p>Apple Tours has had problems almost since it began operations in 1992 with two used buses. The company hoped to corner the competitive tour operator market in New York, and decided that the best course was to use crowd-pleasing double-deckers. That required Apple Tours to import the vehicles, which did not meet United States environmental and safety standards.</p>
        <p>In 1995, the Department of Consumer Affairs grounded the fleet of 31 buses after the company was caught switching license plates to avoid state inspections. The company was allowed to operate again after paying a $100,000 fine and agreeing, among other things, to remove its vice president.</p>
        <p>In September, the company admitted lying on federal forms to skirt  emissions laws on 70 buses imported from Britain. On the forms, filed with  the federal Customs Service, Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Transportation, the company claimed that the buses were made in 1967 and were therefore exempt from federal safety and emissions standards. But the buses were actually made much later. The company agreed to pay $800,000 and comply with the law.</p>
        <p>The company also ran afoul of city and state inspectors in 1995 for operating an open-air garage that officials said violated building codes and environmental regulations. The company was ordered to obtain a new certificate of occupancy and remove or render safe 14 underground gasoline tanks on the property.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 24, 2000, Wednesday  An article in some copies yesterday about a man killed by a tour bus in Manhattan misstated the given name of a city councilwoman who criticized the tour company. She is Christine Quinn, not Kathleen.</p>
