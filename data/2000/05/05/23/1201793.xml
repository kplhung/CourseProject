      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The cockpit voice recorder was not working in the twin-engine turboprop that crashed near Scranton, Pa., on Sunday morning and apparently had never worked, because it was the wrong model for that airplane, the National Transportation Safety Board said today. And the plane did not carry a flight data recorder, the other kind of ''black box.''</p>
        <p>''This seriously hampers the investigation, let's face it,'' said George W. Black Jr., the safety board member assigned to the crash scene, as investigators looked for clues that could explain why the plane, on a flight from Atlantic City, crashed as it made its second approach to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport, killing all 19 people aboard.</p>
        <p>''We're now reduced on this accident to having only radar data and whatever information we can glean from that,'' along with statements from witnesses, Mr. Black said.</p>
        <p>The investigators also have statements from a crew member to an air traffic controller, including, ''We've lost both engines.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Black said this evening that the plane's operator, Executive Airlines, told the safety board that it had made modifications to make the cockpit voice recorder work, even though investigators examining the recorder, which was only lightly damaged by the crash, could not find the modifications.</p>
        <p>Investigators also continued to analyze the wreckage today and were seeking to retrieve fuel samples from the soil in an attempt to explain why the engines appeared to have failed. A preliminary analysis of a sample taken from the truck used to refuel the plane found no problem. The truck was at Republic Airport, in Farmingdale, N.Y., where Executive Airlines is based. The plane was being flown as a charter flight.</p>
        <p>The plane was a BAE Jetstream 31, which is popular with commuter airlines, and in that role it must carry a cockpit voice recorder and a flight data recorder. The voice recorder also captures cockpit sounds, including engine pitch. Mr. Black said investigators now hoped to get that information from tapes of the pilots' conversations with air traffic controllers.</p>
        <p>The flight data recorder captures engine performance, and, in some cases, records warnings as they are issued to the crew. Under Federal</p>
        <p>Aviation Administration rules, planes with six or more passenger seats and for which two pilots are required must have cockpit voice recorders, but charters do not have to have flight data recorders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Black said that the voice recorder on the plane that crashed needed 120 volts alternating current but that the plane supplied 28 volts direct current.</p>
        <p>Other Jetstream 31's carry voice recorders with an inverter, a device that turns direct current into alternating current. But this one did not, Mr. Black said, and that would have been obvious every time the recorder was tested.</p>
        <p>''I've heard people say that the flight data recorder tells you what happens and sometimes, if you're lucky, the cockpit voice recorder tells you why something happened,'' Mr. Black said. ''So now we don't have what happened because we have no data recorder and we also do not have the voice recorder, which might have explained to us some of the conversations between the crew during this last part of the flight.''</p>
        <p>Investigators are trying to understand why both engines failed. Failure of a single engine is unusual, but both at once is extremely rare.</p>
        <p>Of the many possibilities, a flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder together might have made clear what happened; for example, if one engine faltered and the crew tried to shut it down but mistakenly turned off the wrong engine.</p>
        <p>Turboprops are essentially jet engines with a propeller attached and have about the same reliability as other jet engines, in contrast to the piston-driven engines common in single-engine planes. As Mr. Black said today, ''One of the reasons for having two engines is so that you can have two almost totally independent systems, separate fuel feeds, separate ignition systems, just as this kind of a backup.''</p>
        <p>The fire after the crash is an indication that the plane still had fuel aboard, experts say.</p>
        <p>Mr. Black said this evening that after the plane made its first approach, which it apparently abandoned because of poor visibility, tower controllers were trying to direct it to a highway or an open field.</p>
        <p>Most of the crashes that the safety board investigates are of planes with no recorders, because they are privately owned, general aviation planes. But the results of those investigations are often less authoritative than those with better data.</p>
