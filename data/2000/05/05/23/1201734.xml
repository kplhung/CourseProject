        <p>The Fox News Network, which previously criticized James J. Cramer for plugging a stock he owned on TheStreet.com cable television program, went to court yeterday to try to force Mr. Cramer to continue appearing on the program.</p>
        <p>Fox, a unit of the News Corporation, said it filed suit in New York state court against TheStreet.com, an investor Internet site that produces the program, and against Mr. Cramer, a hedge fund manager and co-founder of TheStreet.com, who is a commentator for the program.</p>

        <p>The Fox News Network, which previously criticized James J. Cramer for plugging a stock he owned on TheStreet.com cable television program, went to court yeterday to try to force Mr. Cramer to continue appearing on the program.</p>
        <p>Fox, a unit of the News Corporation, said it filed suit in New York state court against TheStreet.com, an investor Internet site that produces the program, and against Mr. Cramer, a hedge fund manager and co-founder of TheStreet.com, who is a commentator for the program.</p>
        <p>The suit seeks to force TheStreet. com to keep producing the program, which it intends to halt after this coming weekend's broadcast, and to force Mr. Cramer to appear on it.</p>
        <p>In the suit, Fox said TheStreet. com and Mr. Cramer had ''blatantly disregarded their obligations to Fox News in a transparent attempt to extricate themselves from business deals they no longer like.''</p>
        <p>The suit asks for injunctions requiring the program to continue, and barring TheStreet.com from reaching an agreement with any other network. It also seeks unspecified monetary damages.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cramer, who has a separate contract with Fox, has not appeared on the show since the taped April 14 program for broadcast the following day. On that program, he recommended the stock of TheStreet.com itself. More than a week later, a Fox spokesman was quoted in The Daily News as criticizing Mr. Cramer. ''Despite offering full disclosure of his ownership position, we do not approve of the touting of stock for personal gain on the air,'' the spokesman was quoted as saying.</p>
        <p>The Street.com cited that statement as being a new policy in announcing last week that it would stop producing the program. It later relented, and last week's show was taped, but Fox said TheStreet.com had notified it that this weekend's program would be the last.</p>
        <p>Fox's suit maintains that TheStreet.com has a legal obligation to continue making the program until May 7, 2001, and that Mr. Cramer is under contract to Fox to appear on the weekly broadcast at least 40 times a year.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for TheStreet. com declined to comment on the suit, saying she had not seen it.</p>
        <p>Eric Seiler, a lawyer for Mr. Cramer, said last night that ''through its prior actions, Fox News has repudiated the contract with Cramer and he is available to appear on other programming.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''while we have not seen the specific allegations of the complaint, we believe them to be totally without merit.''</p>
        <p>The New York Times Company owns a 6.3 percent stake in TheStreet.com and operates a nine-member joint newsroom with it that files articles for the Web sites of both TheStreet.com and The New York Times.</p>
