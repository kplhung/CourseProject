        <p>Suddenly, the engineering workshops at Snecma S.A., the engine maker based in Paris, seem as pristine as a chapel. The nude photographs and girlie calendars that used to be plastered on some of the walls have disappeared into desk drawers or been tossed into the trash bin.</p>
        <p>For that, the men in the department mostly have one of their few female colleagues to thank. Fabienne Lecore, an aerodynamics engineer, said she started arguing against the cheesecake from the moment she joined the company 13 years ago.</p>
        <p>''It was being done just to provoke women,'' said Ms. Lecore, 37. ''When I said we didn't like it, they laughed at me.'' Gradually, though, the men bowed to the growing pressure, she said, and removed the offending pictures. But not without a Gallic shrug at the pointlessness of the change. After all, said Mark Messmer, a 43-year-old Snecma engineer, the French are masters of innocent sexual repartee. ''There are a lot of jokes between men and women,'' he said. ''But I've never observed that it went in the direction of sexual harassment.'' Mr. Messmer, like many of his compatriots, said he saw little harm in ''beautiful decorations of nude women.''</p>
        <p>When one thinks of France, certain images spring to mind. The accordion. Foie gras. Ah, yes, the French lover, whose seductive skills have long seemed as much a birthright as a good Bordeaux. Eroticism has helped to define the country. The disclosure by the former president, Francois Mitterrand, of a decades-long relationship with a mistress created barely a ripple -- and when it did, it was an approving one. And the national symbol is the voluptuous Marianne, whose previous real-life incarnations have included Brigitte Bardot and Catherine Deneuve and whose current one is the young supermodel Laetitia Casta, best known for lingerie ads.</p>
        <p>But to judge from discussions of the entanglements of sex in the workplace, it appears that some all-too-American factors, like frenzied work schedules and the fear of litigation, have lately thrown cold water over French men's office amorousness.</p>
        <p>''There's still a lot of flirting and affairs in the offices,'' said Veronique Jullien, who four years ago started the School of Seduction, a small company near the Paris Opera House that claims to teach Parisians to recapture the art of snagging a lover. But she added, with pain in her voice: ''The French lover is disappearing. There is a lot of stress. And men are very afraid of businesswomen, of successful women.''</p>
        <p>Added to the wilting effect of overwork is a relatively new issue in France: sexual harassment lawsuits. France passed a workplace sexual harassment law in 1992, largely in response to European Union legislation. It allows women to sue for redress, but it is limited to harassment by a superior over a subordinate. A plaintiff must also prove that her career has been harmed by refusing sexual advances. Typically, many cases do not make it to court.</p>
        <p>''It usually goes this way: the woman complains about her boss, and then she's fired,'' said Basil Yakovlev, a lawyer specializing in workplace harassment. Then she sues, but damages, if they are awarded, are usually token sums. ''Judges will say it's because the woman is dressed too seductively,'' Mr. Yakovlev said.</p>
        <p>French women do tend to dress for work in ways intended to catch the roving eyes of their male colleagues. Janet McDonald, an American lawyer who moved to Paris five years ago, recalls her surprise on the first day of her job with a small French firm. ''I wore my pinstripe suit and black shoes; I looked like a classic Manhattan lawyer,'' she said. ''And I felt like the frumpiest grandmother in the place. First thing I did, immediately, was send all my skirts to the seamstress to cut off three inches.''</p>
        <p>She quickly concluded that she either had to adapt to the more laissez-faire atmosphere of the French workplace or dig in for continual combat with male colleagues. She describes scenes and banter that might well result in a reprimand or worse in American offices. Once, a co-worker summoned his buddies to Ms. McDonald's desk to survey her low-cut red sweater. She says she was regularly asked why she ''wasn't fat like most American women.'' And she often heard male managers say they did not want to consider a female job applicant because she was not ''cute enough.''</p>
        <p>Ms. McDonald said she learned to laugh off the sexual innuendo at the French firm, but ultimately moved to an American company. Even so, she said, she still tells French colleagues at other firms that not only would they ''never survive in an American firm, but some of them would be in prison.''</p>
        <p>Such warnings mostly provoke smirks from men who savor their international reputation as Don Juans. ''Here we don't care about sexual harassment,'' declared one lawyer who, despite his bravado, asked that his name not be published. ''Being a macho is seen as a good thing in the office. If you're hitting on beautiful women, that's a good thing.''</p>
        <p>If such openness sounds crude to some American ears, there is equal distaste here for American norms. In the popular media and in innumerable cafe conversations, American workplaces are portrayed as humorless prisons. And in a country where men and women at work typically greet one another every morning with a peck on both cheeks, America's near-ban on physical contact in the workplace strikes many as a throwback to Victorian times.</p>
        <p>In the April issue of the small monthly magazine Liaisons Sociales, for example, a French correspondent in New York tells French employees what to expect if they are transferred to the United States.</p>
        <p>''Fifteen years after the first harassment trials, puritanism in the office is total,'' writes Michele Aulagnon. ''A suggestive calendar in a man's locker? Prohibited. Below-the-belt jokes? Totally excluded. Comments about physique? Illegal. The result is that behavior in the workplace has been profoundly changed. The doors of offices are always open. The secretaries are always present during tete-a-tete meetings, in case they need to be witnesses in litigation.''</p>
        <p>Horror story though her account is meant to be, some French women's organizations are hoping to move companies here closer to her description of the American workplace. ''Current French law makes no mention of things like improper jokes, of the most unpleasant daily behavior,'' said Linda Weil-Curiel, a lawyer in Paris who specializes in women's discrimination cases. ''The law needs to be completed.''</p>
        <p>Her hard-line view is not widely shared, however. Even advocates of a sexist-free workplace tend to favor persuasion over litigation. Ms. Lecore, the Snecma engineer who fought displays of naked women, for one, does not think legislation is the solution. Rather, she said: ''If someone goes too far with remarks, I tell him. I don't interpret them in a bad way.''</p>
        <p>For old-school believers in the mystique of the Latin lover, though, things have already gone too far. The ideal paramour is no longer a Frenchman, said Ms. Jullien, the founder of the School of Seduction. ''The Italians,'' she said. ''They're the best now.''</p>
