        <p>Cory Fleming, like several players in the Arena Football League, has National Football League experience. He owns a Super Bowl XXX ring, too, earned with the Dallas Cowboys in 1996.</p>
        <p>Fleming, a receiver, is catching passes now for the Nashville Kats, and his desire is like that of most of his new peers: one more shot in the N.F.L. But not at any cost, not at any price. Since the league is growing in stature and in interest from N.F.L. scouts, Fleming can be choosy.</p>
        <p>''The Oakland Raiders talked to me early this year about coming to their camp, and all I wanted was a small signing bonus to be able to give up the little money I'm making in the Arena League,'' Fleming said. ''They said no, so I said no. It really hurt. That doesn't mean doors won't open somewhere else before the N.F.L. season starts this fall. The climate is right now for guys to move up from the A.F.L. to the N.F.L. It may not be a mass exodus, but you're going to see more Kurt Warners.''</p>
        <p>Warner, the St. Louis Rams' Super Bowl most valuable player at quarterback, has boosted the league's image.</p>
        <p>This fast, furious spring indoor football game played on a 50-yard field with eight men to a side, with waist-high walls bordering the action and passes and points flowing in bunches, was what Warner once played. He was an Iowa Barnstormer in the league before breaking nearly all of the Rams' single-season passing records last season.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure I was like a lot of scouts in the N.F.L,'' said Jon Kingdon, the Raiders' player personnel director. ''We would get Arena tape on a player, put it in a corner stacked with other tapes and may or may not get to it by the end of the year. Now, when I get Arena tape, I pop it in the machine.''</p>
        <p>John Butler, the Buffalo Bills' general manager, said: ''Great athletes can come from any place. Teams in the N.F.L. know now that if you don't take a look at the Arena League, you are cheating yourself. And if you ever get to the point where you don't think you need to check it out, shame on you. I still believe that we get players from other leagues in this order: our European league, the Canadian League and then the Arena League. Now, the fact is, not everybody can play in the National Football League. But there are certainly a handful of players in the Arena League who can.''</p>
        <p>The Arena League, now with 17 teams, is in its 14th season. The 14-game regular season runs from mid-April to late July followed by the playoffs and the Arena Bowl championship. Danny White, the former Dallas quarterback, is head coach of the Arizona Rattlers. The former Jet Bruce Harper and the former Giants Carl Banks, Harry Carson, Joe Morris and Jim Burt are part owners of the New Jersey Red Dogs. The country singer Travis Tritt is a Nashville co-owner.</p>
        <p>The game is all about passing and scoring. A final score could be 66-55.</p>
        <p>''This is a game of football condensed from 100 yards to 50 yards to fit indoors,'' said Sam Wyche, a former N.F.L. head coach in Tampa Bay and in Cincinnati who serves as an analyst for A.F.L. Thursday night games on the Nashville Network. ''In the N.F.L. you must have seven men on the line of scrimmage; here, four. Those huge nets behind the end zone are part of the playing field, so a ball that bounces off them is live. It's just a quicker game. You've got guys playing both offense and defense.</p>
        <p>''This is a very fan-friendly game. When I coached in the N.F.L., you had to be a V.I.P. to sit in the front rows of games and to get any chance to meet players in practices. In the Arena game, a player may come over the wall and land right in your lap. It is affordable for families. After the games, fans are allowed onto the field, and the players come back out for at least half an hour to sign autographs. This league even has a Bill of Rights for its fans, and the crowds at these games are younger and have a blast. The A.F.L. is on to something, because a few years ago you could buy a franchise for less than half a million dollars, and now they are selling for $5 to $10 million.''</p>
        <p>And the league could grow if the N.F.L. decides to do business. The N.F.L. has an option to buy a 49 percent minority interest in the Arena League and has two years left to exercise that option. Some N.F.L. owners -- Robert K. Kraft of the Patriots, Tom Benson of the Saints and Daniel Snyder of the Redskins -- have expressed interest in owning Arena League teams in their cities. The N.F.L. views the Arena League as a different form of the game at a different time of the year with a different audience.</p>
        <p>''Some of our owners say we should stick to being the N.F.L. with football played on a 100-yard field,'' the league spokesman Joe Browne said. ''Others see it as an opportunity to have year-round football and a way to build even more interest in football in their cities. There is interest from our league in the Arena League.''</p>
        <p>And that is good for the Arena League players.</p>
        <p>''I scored 66 touchdowns in my career at Grambling and was on the practice squad with the Colts for two years,'' said Nashville receiver Tyronne Jones, who went to the same New Orleans high school as Rams running back Marshall Faulk, then his backup. ''When I got a call about the Arena League, I thought, 'What, that is a league for rejects.' And who wants to play in a league where you can get hit, hit a wall and then hit the ground? But I was wrong.''</p>
        <p>Nashville lineman James Baron, the league's defensive player of the year last season, was in the Detroit Lions' training camp in 1996. The Chicago Bears showed interest in him this year. But Baron knows the N.F.L. is a numbers game.</p>
        <p>''For some guys in the A.F.L. who have been here a while, it hasn't been worth it to give up what you have to chase a dream where you don't get a fair chance,'' Baron said. ''I'd say there are a good 50 players in this league who can play in the N.F.L. But the salaries in our league range from $13,000 to $150,000, and for the guys with families it is tough to keep giving that up to chase a dream that doesn't happen. I don't think Kurt Warner, as proud as we are of him, was the best quarterback in our league. But Kurt has given us all credibility.''</p>
        <p>Tommy Maddox, a former N.F.L. first-round draft pick, throws passes for the Red Dogs now.</p>
        <p>''We don't have the luxurious facilities or the chartered flights, but it boils down to guys wanting to play football, including me,'' Maddox said. ''I'm 28 and I get a chance to play again, and that is great. We're all playing for that one more shot.''</p>
        <p>Most Arena League players have a second job. The Red Dogs' George LaFrance found special off-season work. LaFrance, a 12-year veteran who has been one of the league's ambassadors, works as a counselor on an American Indian reservation in New Mexico.</p>
        <p>Different players, different stories, but most with the same goal.</p>
        <p>''Kurt Warner -- he got a chance,'' LaFrance said. ''Just give guys a chance. I think the N.F.L. is waking up.''</p>
