        <p>The stock market plunged early yesterday as jittery investors dumped the technology stocks that many already agreed were overpriced and also sold some of the so-called old-economy stocks that had actually been doing reasonably well recently.</p>
        <p>But by the time the market closed, the major indexes had done what has become normal recently, rebounded, leaving the market down only moderately. Enough investors, apparently, are still looking to buy on the dips, despite the Federal Reserve's clear warning last week of higher interest rates in the months ahead.</p>
        <p>Some of the old-economy stocks did not recover very much, however. Among these was General Motors, which disappointed investors by limiting the exchange of its stock for shares in its Hughes Electronics subsidiary. G.M. finished down 9 3/8, or about 11 percent, at 77 5/8. It fell as low as 76 5/16 .</p>
        <p>The morning sell-off sent the technology-heavy Nasdaq index down 217 points, or 6.4 percent. That left it below the 3,321.29 it closed at on April 14, after a week in which the index fell a record 25.3 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 257 points, or 2.4 percent, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 38 points, or 2.7 percent. Both remained just above their April 14 closes.</p>
        <p>But at the close, after investors bought up stocks from Intel and Yahoo to Cisco Systems and Ebay, the Nasdaq index finished down just 26.19 points, or 0.77 percent, at 3,364.21.</p>
        <p>As a result of the late rally, yesterday became only the third day in the last six weeks in which the Nasdaq composite closed with a daily change of less than one percentage point. As recently as 1995, less than one day in five ended with a change of more than 1 percent, but volatility has been rising since then.</p>
        <p>Led by late rallies in J. P. Morgan and I.B.M., the Dow Jones industrial average closed down just 84.30 points, or 0.79 percent, to 10,542.55. And the S.&amp; P. 500, led back by AT&amp;T and Intel, was off 6.23 points, or 0.44 percent, at 1,400.72.</p>
        <p>In the bond market, prices rose a little and yields, which move in the opposite direction, slipped as some investors shifted their money from stocks to bonds. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell to 6.44 percent, from 6.48 percent on Friday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, rose 12/32 , to 100 14/32 . The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.19 percent from 6.20 percent on Friday, while the price rose 8/32 , to 100 28/32 .</p>
        <p>And the price of crude oil for June delivery, which had popped above $30 a barrel last week, fell $1.28, or 4.3 percent, to $28.61 a barrel after the president of OPEC said the organization's members would pump more oil to keep its price within its desired range of $22 to $28 a barrel.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the slump in all the major stock indexes was a continuation of the selling that began last week after the Federal Reserve raised its short-term interest rate target half a percentage point, to 6.5 percent, and signaled that more rate increases were likely.</p>
        <p>''People are realizing that higher interest rates won't be good for high- multiple technology stocks; that technology stocks may be sensitive to the economy,'' said Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch.</p>
        <p>As the threat of higher interest rates has sunk in, analysts are also beginning to reconsider their outlook for corporate earnings for the S.&amp; P. 500, which were spectacular in the first quarter of this year, rising 23.5 percent from a year earlier, and are forecast to be strong this quarter, up 18.1 percent.</p>
        <p>Thomas McManus, the equity strategist at Banc of America Securities, said yesterday that he was cutting his forecast of S.&amp; P. 500 earnings growth for this year to 12 percent from 13.7 percent. ''By the second half of this year we expect to see far fewer positive revisions and far more negative revisions in earnings,'' he said. ''And I don't know if the market is prepared for that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McManus, a stock market bull who just four weeks ago was recommending that investors put 80 percent of their portfolio into equities, cut that recommendation back to 70 percent, while he raised his bond recommendation to 30 percent and has nothing in cash. ''Our 70/30/0 allocation is still moderately optimistic, compared with 'normal' recommendations'' of 60 percent to 65 percent of a portfolio in stocks, he said.</p>
        <p>What may make earnings disappointments harder for investors to take is that earnings forecasts for the current quarter and this year have been rising recently. According to First Call/Thomson Financial, which collects analysts' forecasts, the earnings growth rate forecast for the companies in the S.&amp; P. 500 index has risen to 18.8 percent for the second quarter from a 16 percent prediction at the beginning of this year.</p>
        <p>More significantly, the forecast for the second quarter has actually climbed from 17.6 percent on March 1. Usually, analysts trim their current-quarter earnings predictions during that quarter by two to three percentage points, as the companies give clearer guidance on what to expect.</p>
        <p>Robert Barbera, the chief economist at Hoenig &amp; Company, said, ''What people are just beginning to realize is that a second shoe is going to drop; technology companies will have their fair share of earnings disappointments.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barbera said that some investors and analysts have argued that the technology sector will be relatively immune to higher interest rates because these companies have been raising their money in the stock market, through new stock issues, or have bought other companies using their own stock.</p>
        <p>But he argues that the Fed's ability to slow economic growth will put pressure on stocks, and therefore, make it difficult for technology companies to raise new funds or buy new companies. And that will hurt their earnings.</p>
        <p>Although he is bullish on the near-term earnings outlook, Richard Bernstein, director of quantitative research at Merrill Lynch, agrees. ''I think you are going to see a lot of disappointments soon'' in the technology sector, he said. ''What if your strategy was growth through acquisitions and nobody wants your stock anymore?''</p>
        <p>More than half the owners of G.M. shares had offered to swap them for shares in Hughes Electronics, which provides DirecTV satellite television. G.M. said it would swap just one-quarter of the shares that were offered.</p>
