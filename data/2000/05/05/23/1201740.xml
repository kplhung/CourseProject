        <p>A shroud of weariness seemed to envelop Orlando Hernandez as he pitched Sunday against the Cleveland Indians. He loitered between pitches, stepping off the mound, wiping his right hand across his forehead. The man who loves to play baseball never smiled.</p>
        <p>Hernandez has not won in about a month, and he assumes responsibility for that, but the fact is, he and the other Yankee pitchers have been operating with very small margins for error. Sometimes, that makes a pitcher try too hard, Manager Joe Torre said. Beyond the Yankees' struggle for runs is that they have played so poorly on defense, perhaps the most surprising development of the first quarter of the season.</p>
        <p>Club officials met in Tampa, Fla., today to evaluate the Yankees as they begin an important week of play. The Yankees (24-16) are one game behind Boston (25-15) in the American League East, and after three games here against the White Sox, they will play host to the Red Sox in a three-game series at Yankee Stadium. Others in the organization say George Steinbrenner, the principal owner, was displeased with the back-to-back losses in Cleveland over the weekend. And with the team performing erratically, he is likely moving closer to pushing for change.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' performance in the next six games could weigh heavily. The strongest evidence of this is how the club waited so long before placing shortstop Derek Jeter on the disabled list. Jeter, recovering from a strained abdomen, will be eligible to play Saturday against the Red Sox; they hoped he would be available to play Friday.</p>
        <p>In many of Steinbrenner's meetings, he asks officials and scouts to offer appraisals of virtually every player on the team, every aspect of the team -- and that would include the dubious defense. Torre has said he expects the Yankees to perform more efficiently, but they have been giving away runs in bunches.</p>
        <p>They have permitted 23 unearned runs this season, a rate unprecedented in Torre's tenure as manager; by contrast, the Yankees allowed only 37 unearned runs the entire 1998 season. Scott Brosius missed 17 games because of a strained rib cage, and in his absence, there were seven errors committed by the third basemen.</p>
        <p>But Brosius has five errors, Jeter had four before getting hurt, second baseman Chuck Knoblauch has five, and pitchers have accounted for four. On Saturday, Lance Johnson botched a line drive in left field that cost the Yankees a pivotal run in a 3-2 loss to the Indians.</p>
        <p>''The thing we've always done really well is not giving the other team anything extra,'' Brosius said. ''We just haven't done that lately. We've been giving other teams extra chances. We've kind of beat ourselves, and that's not the trademark of a good team.''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner's evaluators would have good things to say about center fielder Bernie Williams, who has played in every game and is off to the best start of his career. Williams has 10 homers and 39 runs batted in. Projected over a full season, that rate of production would give him 40 homers and 158 R.B.I., far better than his career highs of 29 home runs and 115 R.B.I.</p>
        <p>Williams, a switch-hitter who is naturally right-handed, usually takes weeks or months to hone his left-handed swing. Opposing right-handed pitchers attacked him with high fastballs and, early in '98 and '99, Williams struggled to handle this approach in April and May.</p>
        <p>But Williams seemed to master that part of his swing in March this year. He is not sure if this has anything to do with the laser surgery he had in the off-season to correct his vision -- against the vehement protests of the Yankees -- but he does know he is much more relaxed at the plate, without having to step out of the batter's box repeatedly because of his contact lenses.</p>
        <p>''It was not that big of a factor before, but it is as far as peace of mind having to worry about them,'' Williams said. ''You notice I'm calling fewer and fewer timeouts now in the batter's box; it's because my eyes aren't drying out.''</p>
        <p>Jorge Posada, the Yankee catcher, is batting .336 with 19 extra-base hits and is rewarding club officials for their adamant assertions to Steinbrenner that he would blossom one day. But the Yankees continue to search for a backup catcher, to lighten Posada's heavy workload. The Yankees have had about one day off every week, giving Posada built-in rest in the schedule.</p>
        <p>So far, however, Posada has started 36 games and come off the bench to catch in three others -- 39 of 40 games in all. Yogi Berra set the Yankees' record by catching 149 games in a 154-game schedule in 1954.</p>
        <p>Torre intends to rest Posada more as the season progresses, as the number of off days wanes and summer's heat increases. Chris Turner and Jim Leyritz have been used to spell Posada this season, but executives with other teams say General Manager Brian Cashman is constantly asking about other catchers. The Yankees would love to acquire Tampa Bay's Mike DiFelice; to date, the Devil Rays' asking price has been too high.</p>
        <p>Posada said he feels fine, but because his offense is becoming more important to the Yankees, it will be tantamount to keep him rested in the remaining 122 games. ''I've been working out on my legs, getting them ready for the game, and if I feel anything needs treatment, I get it,'' he said. ''All the off days have been good for me.''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner and his officials have to be thrilled with the bullpen, which has the best earned run average (2.85) in the league and, incredibly, has allowed only two home runs this season. No other A.L. bullpen has surrendered fewer than 12, with most permitting from 15 to 25. The relievers Mike Stanton, Jeff Nelson, Jason Grimsley and Mariano Rivera have been the foundation of the team.</p>
        <p>But Steinbrenner prods, pushes. Even one-fourth into the season, he is apt to ask the question, are the Yankees good enough to win?</p>
