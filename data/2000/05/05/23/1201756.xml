        <p>With less than a week left before Venezuelans cast ballots in a ''mega-election'' to fill every office from president on down, the government's opponents are questioning the integrity of the vote and warning of protests if it is not fair.</p>
        <p>The opposition has accused the National Electoral Council, which is supposed to be impartial and is charged with overseeing the election, of acting to advance the interests of President Hugo Chavez.</p>
        <p>The charges grew in recent days after the electoral body described technical problems that will limit independent monitoring of the election results. An election simulation to evaluate voting and tabulation equipment was downgraded to a partial test, and a plan for civic groups to independently audit the entire vote is in jeopardy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez was elected president in December 1998 after promising a peaceful ''social revolution'' in the country that has been the largest supplier of oil to the United States in recent years. A new Constitution he had drawn up last year requires balloting to ''relegitimize'' his mandate and elect governors of Venezuela's 23 states, mayors of the country's 334 municipalities and members of a new one-chamber National Assembly, state legislatures and city councils.</p>
        <p>All told, more than 35,000 candidates are running for some 6,000 posts in the May 28 vote.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we have ever seen anything so complex as this election,'' said Jennifer L. McCoy, director of the Latin American-Caribbean program of the Carter Center in Atlanta, which has monitored many elections in Latin America, Africa and Asia and is also doing so here.</p>
        <p>After approval of the Constitution in a referendum last December, Mr. Chavez's chief political operative, former Minister of the Interior Luis Miquilena handpicked a new National Electoral Council whose 10 members and alternates include Mr. Miquilena's daughter and former personal secretary. A new electoral code was also decreed, again without input from the opposition.</p>
        <p>The new council has virtually no experience in organizing an election, as its president proudly informed foreign reporters at a recent news conference here.</p>
        <p>Much of the council's technical staff has also been replaced with Chavez supporters, leaving his opponents with the impression that the problems stem not from a lack of competence or experience but from a deliberate effort to rob them of votes.</p>
        <p>''From Miquilena's daughter on down, they are all his people and serve his interests,'' said Jesus Urdaneta Hernandez, who was Mr. Chavez's chief of state security but has now broken with the president and joined the opposition as a candidate for a state governorship. ''We do not believe that in those circumstances, under his authority, there can be a genuine democratic process.''</p>
        <p>But the Chavez camp ascribes  such complaints to what it says is the inability of an opposition presidential candidate, Francisco Arias Cardenas, to make his campaign ignite and his knowledge that he cannot win. ''He has not been able to unite all the anti-Chavez forces, and that has limited him,'' said William Lara, one of the president's political advisers, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>''We are a Caribbean people who like to express emotion, but Arias Cardenas is cold and introverted,'' Mr. Lara, who is also a gubernatorial candidate, continued. ''He would be a good candidate in the United States, but he lacks charisma, and without that, you can't get elected in Venezuela.''</p>
        <p>All of the polls show Mr. Chavez, a former army colonel who in 1992 mounted an unsuccessful coup attempt, leading Mr. Arias Cardenas, who also took part in the coup attempt and was until recently considered the president's closest comrade in arms. But the gap between them fluctuates considerably from one survey to another, from as little as 8 points to as much as 23 points.</p>
        <p>The margin of Mr. Chavez's victory, political experts here say, is likely to be important in the political maneuvering that will follow the election. If Mr. Chavez wins in a landslide, opposition charges of fraud will seem much less persuasive, they say.</p>
        <p>But even before the ballots have been cast, charges of vote manipulation are being heard. On Friday, a group of retired generals calling themselves the Institutional Military Front issued a declaration condemning ''grave irregularities'' and warning of the possibility of unrest afterward.</p>
        <p>''It is probable that certain presidential candidates and vast sectors of society will not accept the results of the election,'' the group's statement warned. ''In that difficult moment, the armed forces should tip the balance to maintain public order and preserve the rule of law.''</p>
        <p>As a result of the organizational flaws and confusion, civic groups have suggested that at least part of the vote be postponed, and today two such groups formally asked a court to delay the balloting.</p>
        <p>But both the Chavez camp and the opposition have come out against that idea, with Mr. Miquilena denouncing it as part of a conspiracy of ''ill-intentioned rumors intended to becloud the balloting.''</p>
