        <p>THE Miami Heat sounded like the hiss from a radiator when it's oversteamed. Jamal Mashburn, Tim Hardaway, Alonzo Mourning, et. al. were complaining, after an 83-82 loss in the deciding Game 7 of their playoff series against the Knicks on Sunday. They were charging that there was ''a conspiracy'' by the referees and the league to make sure that the Knicks won. They imagined that a Los Angeles-New York final series would be a TV-ratings bonanza, a commercial aspect surely not lost on David Stern and his minions.</p>
        <p>It is highly plausible that Stern, sultan of the National Basketball Association, indeed went to bed in Westchester with a smile on his face. But the outcome of the game had profoundly less to do with the refereeing than it did with Miami's shooting free throws as if heaving a medicine ball -- hitting 11 of 21 over all from the foul line (to the Knicks' 28 for 31); or the fact that two of its best shooters, Mashburn and Hardaway, connected on just 9 of 35 shots from the field; or that Mourning did an unfortunate impersonation of Willie Sutton, missing a dunderheaded steal attempt to allow his man, Patrick Ewing, a clear getaway to the basket for the winning jam. Consider also that Pat Riley, the glass of fashion and a basketball brain to match, called two timeouts with 26 and 12 seconds to go and 1 point down, and was unable to concoct a good shot for his team either time.</p>

But the outcome of the game had profoundly less to do with the refereeing than it did with Miami's shooting free throws as if heaving a medicine ball -- hitting 11 of 21 over all from the foul line (to the Knicks' 28 for 31); or the fact that two of its best shooters, Mashburn and Hardaway, connected on just 9 of 35 shots from the field; or that Mourning did an unfortunate impersonation of Willie Sutton, missing a dunderheaded steal attempt to allow his man, Patrick Ewing, a clear getaway to the basket for the winning jam. Consider also that Pat Riley, the glass of fashion and a basketball brain to match, called two timeouts with 26 and 12 seconds to go and 1 point down, and was unable to concoct a good shot for his team either time.</p>
        <p>''I'm very disappointed in their reaction,'' Jeff Van Gundy, the Knicks' coach, said yesterday of the Heat. ''They're attacking the credibility of the league. I can understand their disappointment, and I have a lot of respect for the Heat, but it's not right. I think what they're saying may have a subconscious effect on the league and the officials in our upcoming series.''</p>
        <p>The series beginning tonight against the Pacers, that is. It is a coach's job to clear out any mental viruses that may affect not only his team, but those who would have influence over its fortunes. Namely, the referees.</p>
        <p>Van Gundy doesn't want the referees bending over backward to be nice to people like Reggie Miller (just imagine for a moment, Knick fans, anyone trying to be nice to Reggie), and Van Gundy is taking no chances. Referees are more or less people, Van Gundy understands, and they don't want to be perceived as soft on the Knicks. So he reacts to the reaction, to ward off any evil eye.</p>
        <p>''It's very hard for people to give credit to another team after a loss,'' Van Gundy said. ''It's always some external force.''</p>
        <p>The external forces, in this case, were such aliens as Childs, Ewing, Camby, and Sprewell, fresh from their spaceship.</p>
        <p>As for a conspiracy, anything's possible. But when checking conspiracies, the Heat should make an investigation in their own arena, starting maybe with the janitor. I mean, who put the lid on the basket so the Heat could miss five free throws in the waning, crunch moments of the game? It wasn't Van Gundy, or any of the three referees, that anyone saw, anyhow. But where was the janitor, and, for that matter, the butler?</p>
        <p>This is the lone matter from the Miami series that Van Gundy has any concern with, other than fatigue, of course. And having little time to draw up schemes to outnoodle Larry Bird and his cronies.</p>
        <p>Can the Knicks, meanwhile, after a bruising series against Miami, get their legs, and their lungs, in proper order to combat the Pacers?</p>
        <p>Certainly. These are professionals, and, except for a sore-ankled Allan Houston, appear reasonably sound of body. Even that battered antique, Patrick Ewing, has tapped some spectacular reservoir of energy to come back in the last half of the last two games to play as well as he has ever played.</p>
        <p>And, of course, Reggie won't let anyone's mind wander. ''I hate the Knicks,'' he said yesterday afternoon in Indianapolis.</p>
        <p>Reggie says these things because he enjoys driving people nuts. He's like the kid at the zoo who jabs a stick through the bars to annoy the lion when he's snoozing. It also motivates Miller, apparently, to have people abhor him. Nice work if you can get it.</p>
        <p>But for all the blather, he's a marvelous, clutch player. ''And Jalen Rose is having a career year, and Mark Jackson is a great orchestrator and the Pacers have the best 3-point shooters and best free-throw shooting team in basketball,'' Van Gundy said. ''It's going to be tough.''</p>
        <p>Like the Heat series, this one is a rematch from last year. So a fan may be excused his ennui. After all, same old teams, same old rivalry -- and same old drama, suspense, intrigue, tension, pressure and passion. ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' can hardly do better.</p>
