        <p>Inside ''Enter the Guardsman,'' a first-rate musical is struggling to get out. But until someone fills its music and lyrics with more zest, elevates the level and consistency of its wit and finds the magic to make its wise, bittersweet romance more palpable, ''Enter the Guardsman'' will remain a modest, intermittently charming entertainment. If it never catches fire, it generally exudes warmth.</p>
        <p>In other words, as backstage musicals go, ''Enter the Guardsman'' is no ''Kiss Me, Kate.''</p>

        <p>Inside ''Enter the Guardsman,'' a first-rate musical is struggling to get out. But until someone fills its music and lyrics with more zest, elevates the level and consistency of its wit and finds the magic to make its wise, bittersweet romance more palpable, ''Enter the Guardsman'' will remain a modest, intermittently charming entertainment. If it never catches fire, it generally exudes warmth.</p>
        <p>In other words, as backstage musicals go, ''Enter the Guardsman'' is no ''Kiss Me, Kate.''</p>
        <p>With a book by Scott Wentworth, music by Craig Bohmler and lyrics by Marion Adler, ''Enter the Guardsman,'' at the Dimson Theater at 108 East 15th Street, can lay claim to a first-rate cast and a historic pedigree.</p>
        <p>Directed by Mr. Wentworth, the show is a musical version of Ferenc Molnar's comedy ''The Guardsman,'' a tale of romance and tested love between an acting couple united by marriage that served as a vehicle for the husband-and-wife team of Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne.</p>
        <p>In ''Enter the Guardsman,'' the newlywed Actor who tests his wife's love by disguising himself as a smitten guardsman is played by Robert Cuccioli, who also split his personality on Broadway as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The Actress, a lovely woman with a trail of lovers who appears to be growing weary of her marriage after only six months, is played by Marla Schaffel, whose Broadway credits include ''Titanic'' and ''Les Miserables.''</p>
        <p>And the Playwright, a friend of both who narrates the story as a tale of literary creation based on wondering about the effect of the arrival of a single rose in the Actress's dressing room, is portrayed by Mark Jacoby, who has appeared on Broadway as Gaylord Ravenal in ''Show Boat'' and Father in ''Ragtime.''</p>
        <p>So the talent has been assembled to bring out the most in ''Enter the Guardsman'' and it is ably abetted in its mission by Derin Altay as the Dresser, a wise veteran of the theater; by Kate Dawson as the Wardrobe Mistress, Rusty Ferracane as the Wigs Master and Buddy Crutchfield as the Assistant Stage Manager, and by a live orchestra under the musical direction of Nicholas Archer.</p>
        <p>''Enter the Guardsman'' derives its underlying strength from Molnar's cosmopolitan view of love and marriage, just as ''My Fair Lady'' found itself in the happy position of being able to build on the witty splendor of Shaw's ''Pygmalion.</p>
        <p>But where Lerner and Loewe elevated the play's romance into the realm of enchantment with their lyrics and music, here the effort, while discernible, falls short. While no single song stands out, there are pleasures to be found in ''Drama,'' a first-act tango, and the nostalgic ''Waiting in the Wings'' in the second act.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuccioli is at his comic best as the hirsute, heel-clicking, accented guardsman; Ms. Schaffel brings the requisite allure and restlessness to the role of the Actress; Mr. Jacoby, who seems to be be navigating between Rex Harrison and George Sanders as the Playwright, nevertheless finds the mischief in the role, and Ms. Altay is touching as the Dresser.</p>
        <p>First presented at the Donmar Warehouse in London, ''Enter the Guardsman'' offers sufficient promise to hope that another coat of polish might bring it a luster that still seems achievable.</p>
        <p>ENTER THE GUARDSMAN  Book by Scott Wentworth; music by Craig Bohmler; lyrics by Marion Adler. Based on the book ''The Guardsman'' by Ferenc Molnar; directed by Mr. Wentworth; sets and costumes by Molly Reynolds; lighting by Jeff Croiter; sound by One Dream Sound/David Ferdinand; orchestrations by Mr. Bohmler; music direction by Nicholas Archer; music coordinator, John Miller; associate director, Jason King Jones; production manager, Kai Brothers. Presented by the Weissberger Theater Group, Jay Harris, producer, in association with Shelley M. Shier. At the Dimson Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>WITH: Robert Cuccioli (the Actor), Marla Schaffel (the Actress), Mark Jacoby (the Playwright), Derin Altay (the Dresser), Kate Dawson (the Wardrobe Mistress), Rusty Ferracane (the Wigs Master) and Buddy Crutchfield (the Assistant Stage Manager).</p>
