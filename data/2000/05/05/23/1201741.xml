        <p>As envoys arrived here to try to end the outbreak of war between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the Ethiopian prime minister said today that he was willing to talk but would not stop fighting as the talks go on.</p>
        <p>''We shall negotiate while fighting,'' the leader, Meles Zenawi, told diplomats from other African nations today. ''We shall fight while negotiating. Both roads lead to peace. Whichever road leads us to peace quicker, that will be the road we follow in the final analysis.''</p>
        <p>Fighting reignited 10 days ago, when Ethiopia mounted an offensive it says is aimed at ending the costly two-year war over a disputed border. Today, Mr. Zenawi spoke from a position of strength: Ethiopia has pressed deeply into Eritrean territory, saying it will not leave until Eritrea abandons territory it captured in the last two years.</p>
        <p>Reno Serri, the European Union's special envoy to the Horn of Africa, came here today after three hours of talks with the president of Eritrea, Isaias Afwerki. Also, Ahmed Ouyahia, the special envoy of the chairman of the Organization for African Unity, is meeting with Ethiopia's leaders. Both diplomats support a peace plan brokered by the O.A.U. but neither said a breakthrough was imminent.</p>
        <p>''This mission's work has only just begun,'' Mr. Serri, an undersecretary in the Italian Foreign Ministry,  told reporters in the Eritrean capital, Asmara. ''I don't think situations always stay the same. I think they move and I am here to move it.''</p>
        <p>Yemane Ghebremeskel, a spokesman for the Eritrean government, said they too were willing to resume talks, which broke off earlier this month in Algeria. But, despite what appear to be severe setbacks on the battlefield, he said Eritrea was willing to settle the dispute militarily.</p>
        <p>''We don't have any problem with diplomacy,'' he said in a telephone interview tonight from Asmara. But he added, ''The war will continue and we will see who will prevail at the end of the day.''</p>
        <p>Meantime, the United Nations World Food Program said today that it would send the first shipment of food into Eritrea, in an effort to feed hundreds of thousands of Eritreans who have fled fighting in the western part of the nation. Officials said they would fly 40 tons of high-energy biscuits into Asmara on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Both nations have agreed in principle on a peace document. Eritrea has said it wants a cease-fire first, but Ethiopia wants the details nailed down before the fighting ends.</p>
        <p>With most of the fighting over in western Eritrea, a battle was shaping up at the town of Areza, according to a military analyst here from a Western nation. That battle could be decisive militarily and extraordinarily fierce, he said.</p>
