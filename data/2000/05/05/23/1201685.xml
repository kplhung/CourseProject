        <p>With high-carbohydrate foods getting such a bad rap, it is refreshing to hear about new findings that clearly demonstrate the health value of a carbohydrate-rich diet, as long as it contains the right carbohydrates, replete with soluble and insoluble fiber, the way nature made them. Fiber has also been knocked around a bit lately, after three disappointing studies failed to find that a high-fiber diet helped to prevent colon cancer.</p>
        <p>If preventing colon cancer was the only reason to eat fiber, I would say you could safely abandon bran muffins, whole-grain cereals, beans and peas and fiber-rich fruits and vegetables and return to a pristine diet of pasty white bread. But dietary fiber, as the new study so graphically showed, has myriad health benefits. The study also shows that people need not resort to a very low-fat diet to reap those benefits, as long as the fat in their diets is also the right kind.</p>

        <p>If preventing colon cancer was the only reason to eat fiber, I would say you could safely abandon bran muffins, whole-grain cereals, beans and peas and fiber-rich fruits and vegetables and return to a pristine diet of pasty white bread. But dietary fiber, as the new study so graphically showed, has myriad health benefits. The study also shows that people need not resort to a very low-fat diet to reap those benefits, as long as the fat in their diets is also the right kind.</p>
        <p>High-Fiber Reduces Risk</p>
        <p>The study, published this month in The New England Journal of Medicine, involved 13 patients with Type 2 diabetes, which typically starts in midlife and accounts for 90 percent of diabetes cases in this country. Each patient diligently followed one of two diets, each for six weeks, eating foods supplied by the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and keeping careful dietary records. Both diets would on their face be considered healthful, meeting the guidelines established for Americans. But with one not-so-drastic change, the experimental diet was clearly superior.</p>
        <p>The standard diet supplied 24 grams of fiber daily (8 grams of soluble fiber and 16 grams of insoluble fiber), as recommended by the American Diabetes Association. The experimental diet supplied double the fiber -- 25 grams of soluble and 25 grams of insoluble fiber daily -- without supplements or foods artificially stoked with extra fiber.</p>
        <p>In other words, the participants consumed normal, unfortified, tasty foods found in any supermarket, foods like oranges and cantaloupe; oatmeal, granola and whole wheat bread; green peas, tomatoes and zucchini with foods like chicken breast, ham, eggs and pasta. Participants had no difficulty downing the high-fiber diet; it contained nothing weird or unpalatable. It was food as food, not as medicine.</p>
        <p>Still, the effect of the experimental diet mimicked improvements commonly associated with medications. There were fewer spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels, meaning the diabetes was better controlled and less likely to damage blood vessels and nerves. Blood lipid levels -- or fat -- dropped too. In addition to lower total cholesterol, blood levels of heart-damaging triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were reduced on the experimental diet by as much as typically results from lipid-lowering drugs.</p>
        <p>Since diabetes greatly increases a person's risk of developing heart disease and other disorders caused by fat-clogged arteries, the results of this study are highly significant to the 14 million Americans with Type 2 diabetes.</p>
        <p>In this study, participants did not lose weight, since their diets were designed to prevent weight loss from masking the benefits of fiber. But other studies have shown that a fiber-rich diet greatly helps someone trying to lose weight. Fiber enhances satiety. It fills people up before it fills them out. It slows the absorption of foods, as if someone was eating many mini-meals, and thus delays the time when the person feels hungry again.</p>
        <p>Cutting Fat Helps, Too</p>
        <p>Although the American Diabetes Association and other health groups recommend a diet containing no more than 30 percent fat, surveys have shown that most people with diabetes derive 34 percent to 40 percent of their calories from fat. And far too much of the fat is artery-damaging saturated fat from animal products instead of the more protective monounsaturates found in olive oil, canola oil, nut oils and avocados. In the Dallas study, the added fat used in both diets was olive oil, which not only benefits the heart and blood vessels but may also protect against some cancers.</p>
        <p>A second study of people with diabetes showed that reducing dietary fat by replacing five typical high-fat foods with versions made with less fat significantly lowered the participants' consumption of cholesterol and saturated fat. Again, the substitute foods were readily available.</p>
        <p>The researchers, from Florida International University in Miami, reported that eating the fat-modified foods ''did not cause people with diabetes to overconsume those foods or other foods.'' It also resulted in a decrease in caloric intake. Their study was published in The Journal of the American Dietetic Association.</p>
        <p>''Use of low-fat or fat-free foods may allow people with diabetes to continue to eat their favorite foods, while considerably decreasing their intake of saturated fats, cholesterol and energy,'' the Florida team wrote. This approach would enable people with diabetes to consume more protective monounsaturates without increasing their caloric intake.</p>
        <p>Fitness Pays Off</p>
        <p>The surgeon general and the American Diabetes Association recommend that, at a minimum, people pursue 30 minutes of moderate physical activity almost daily. Among the many benefits to someone with diabetes are reductions in risk factors for heart and blood vessel diseases, including lowering blood lipid levels and blood pressure, a lessened tendency to form artery-blocking clots and a reduction in weight.</p>
        <p>In a striking demonstration of the benefits of exercise, published last month in The Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers at the Cooper Institute and Clinic in Dallas assessed fitness and activity levels and monitored death rates for 12 years among 1,263 men with Type 2 diabetes. After taking into account factors that could distort their findings, the researchers found that participants in the low-fitness group had double the death rate of men who were fit. Those who reported being physically inactive had a death rate 70 percent higher than those who said they were physically active.</p>
        <p>This and another study in Sweden ''suggest that the amount of exercise needed to achieve a cardioprotective benefit is modest,'' said Dr. Charles M. Clark Jr. of the Richard Roudebush Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Indianapolis.</p>
        <p>''The data supporting the health benefits of physical activity are overwhelming,'' he said in an accompanying editorial.</p>
