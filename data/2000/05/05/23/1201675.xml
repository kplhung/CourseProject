        <p>Putting infants on their backs when they go to sleep is a widely accepted technique for reducing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, but doctors need to do a lot more to get the word out, a new study finds.</p>
        <p>Forty-one percent of parents and baby sitters surveyed reported that their babies' doctors had not told them how to put the children down to sleep, say researchers for the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.</p>
        <p>The researchers, writing in The Journal of the American Medical Association, also found progress in the fight against SIDS. Deaths have gone down almost 40 percent since a campaign emphasizing having children sleep on their backs or sides began in 1994. About 3,000 babies a year die from the syndrome.</p>
        <p>But the researchers said a significant disparity remained between whites and blacks. From 1994 to 1998, they said, stomach placement decreased to 17 percent from 44 percent among white infants; for blacks during the same period, the rate was 32 percent, down from 53 percent. (Black infants are 2.2 times as likely to dies of SIDS as are white ones.) The researchers urged a greater effort to educate black parents.</p>
        <p>When doctors did make recommendations, the study found, parents and others were more likely to place babies on their backs. ''I think that if they're not doing it, then they should be,'' said Marian Willinger, a SIDS specialist at the health institute, referring to doctors. The key, she said, is consistency, so that babies get used to the position.</p>
