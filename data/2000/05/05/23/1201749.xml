        <p>Nearly 30 years ago two National Football League owners swapped teams. Carroll Rosenbloom traded the Baltimore Colts to Robert Irsay for the Los Angeles Rams. That the Colts now play in Indianapolis and the Rams in St. Louis (where they are the reigning Super Bowl champions, no less) is not a direct result of the unique exchange, but of the league's laissez-faire attitude on franchise shifts.</p>
        <p>Major League Baseball has not had a team change cities since 1972. It has never had a swap of franchises. It may be time to have one.</p>
        <p>A not-so-modest proposal:</p>
        <p>To correct and overcome inexplicable decisions in the construction of their teams' new parks, the Detroit Tigers should move to Houston and the Houston Astros should move to Detroit.</p>
        <p>The owners of the teams would not necessarily have to swap them; they could move with their teams. But Michael Ilitch has other interests in Detroit, the Red Wings, for example, as well as the Fox Theater, Olympia Entertainment, Little Caesars Pizza and a company developing projects for downtown Detroit. And Drayton McLane is a Texas guy through and through, both in his businesses and his community endeavors.</p>
        <p>It would seem to make the most sense, then, for these owners to swap teams. And should the move strike anyone as radical, consider that their general managers tried to do it on a less severe basis once before, in 1996, when they engaged in an 11-player trade. A wholesale swap makes sense because as the situations currently exist, neither is working out. The Tigers and the Astros are each lodged in last place in their respective Central Divisions. The Astros have the National League's worst record, the Tigers the American League's second worst.</p>
        <p>Teams strive to hold or reach contending status when they move into new parks. The long downtrodden Cleveland Indians, for example, became a first-place team in their first year at Jacobs Field, creating the model for everyone to follow.</p>
        <p>The Astros, moving into Enron Field, thought they were right where they wanted to be, because they had won the division championship the last three years. First place was an unfamiliar location for the Tigers, but as they began playing at Comerica Park, they thought they could smell a rapid upward movement in the standing. The smell, unfortunately, has turned out to be rotten eggs.</p>
        <p>The problem stems from the new parks. The Astros moved from the spacious Astrodome, where their pitchers thrived, to cozy Enron, where their pitchers have developed involuntary jerking motions in which their heads turn to see if balls are sailing over the claustrophobic outfield fences. The Tigers moved from Tiger Stadium, the most home run-receptive park in the American League last season, to a stadium seemingly so cavernous it will prompt Juan Gonzalez to flee as a free agent after the season.</p>
        <p>The Tigers hit 118 home runs in 81 games at Tiger Stadium last season, an average of 1.46 a game. They have hit seven home runs in 16 games at Comerica Park this season, an average of 0.44 per game.</p>
        <p>The Astros gave up 53 home runs in 82 games at the Astrodome last season, an average of 0.65 per game. They have given up 36 home runs in 19 games at Enron Field this season, an average of 1.9 a game. The team's pitching staff is not as good as it was last season -- it misses Mike Hampton's  22-4 mark -- but its performance on the road has not plunged as precipitously as it has at home. Houston pitchers have given up 1.54 home runs a game on the road compared with 0.94 last season.</p>
        <p>The Astros are at least attracting fans to their new playground. Their average attendance of 39,003 is third highest in the National League and projects to a season total of about 3.2 million. The Tigers, however, are experiencing a disaster. Teams have desperately sought new parks to raise their revenue, but the Tigers will not get rich on 27,249 fans a game, the average attendance for their first 16 home games.</p>
        <p>That average projects to 2.2 million for the season, which would fall well short of the team's expectation of three million. It would also be the lowest first-year average attendance by far of the 10 parks that have opened in the last 11 years.</p>
        <p>The early returns do not bode well for Randy Smith, the Tigers general manager, who constructed Comerica's first team, using the acquisition of Gonzalez as the linchpin of an anticipated surge toward wealth in victories and revenue. Smith did not return a telephone call yesterday seeking his thoughts on a move to Houston.</p>
        <p>A franchise swap could work well for him, though. Smith was born and grew up in Houston, where his father, Tal, continues to live, serving as president of the Astros' baseball operations. The senior Smith could be included in the trade, remaining in Houston to team with his son to operate the Tigers.</p>
        <p>Gerry Hunsicker, the Astros general manager, did not return a call yesterday, either. He was in Milwaukee, watching his team lose a doubleheader, squandering a seven-run lead in the ninth inning of the first game and losing in the 10th. The Astros pitchers have evidently become so shell-shocked from the change in their stadiums that they cannot pitch anywhere else either. Comerica calls to them.</p>
