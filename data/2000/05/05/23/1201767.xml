        <p>Coach Al Groh expects quarterback Vinny Testaverde, on his way back from the Achilles' tendon injury that ended his 1999 season during the first game, to participate fully when the Jets begin a veterans' minicamp today. Testaverde has been participating in passing drills for the past few weeks.</p>
        <p>''He's thrown the ball very nicely,'' Groh said yesterday at a screening of the Jets' 1999 highlight video in Manhattan. ''I anticipate him doing the whole routine.''</p>
        <p>Groh expects all the veterans and rookies to be in the four-day camp, which opened with a meeting last night and includes six practices.</p>
        <p>''Every team has to be reborn each year,'' Groh said of the start of minicamp. ''This is the birth of the new team.''</p>
        <p>Linebacker Mo Lewis, who was designated the team's franchise player at the end of last season, will be at the camp. The Jets were obligated to offer him a one-year deal for an amount that was the average of the top five linebacker salaries in the National Football League, and he signed a one-year contract for $4.187 million.</p>
        <p>Lewis and the Jets initially expected to reach a long-term deal that would keep him with the team until retirement. But although Groh would not discuss it, it appears Lewis will become a free agent after next season. Lewis was angered that he could not explore free agency this year, and the Jets are willing to let him do so next year, when he will be 31 and have 10 years in the league.</p>
        <p>''It's to give both sides a good deal of options,'' Groh said. Groh said the Jets would probably look at veteran wide receivers -- like Cincinnati's Carl Pickens -- when they become salary-cap casualties June 1 and are cut from rosters.</p>
        <p>''I certainly wouldn't rule out that we might do that,'' Groh said. ''That's pretty standard on June 1 just to see if there is a player who would be beneficial to add to the team. I wouldn't say that it's the start of hunting season.''</p>
        <p>Groh said the Jets are in contract talks with representatives for their four first-round draft picks. The Jets will most likely struggle to sign all of them by the start of training camp in July, and several veterans will probably have to be sacrificed to make room under the salary cap.</p>
        <p>The Jets' owner, Woody Johnson, also attended yesterday's screening of ''Fighting Back.'' Johnson, who said he was delighted that Bill Parcells decided to stay on as director of football operations for at least this season, said they would talk at the end of this season to determine if Parcells would remain. ''I tried to convince him to stay, but ultimately it was his loyalty to the team and Al Groh that made it happen,'' Johnson said.</p>
        <p>Johnson said that he had no role in the decision to trade receiver Keyshawn Johnson. ''The coaches made the decision,'' Woody Johnson said. ''It was a hard decision and they made it. I leave those decisions to the coaching staff. They're in a much better position to evaluate.''</p>
