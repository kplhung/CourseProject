        <p>The Army has canceled the new appointment of Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith in the wake of accusations by the Army's highest-ranking woman that he made an unwanted sexual advance toward her in 1996, officials said today.</p>
        <p>General Smith's appointment as the Army's deputy inspector general, a position in which he would have been responsible for investigating accusations against senior officers, has been delayed since the officer, Lt. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy, made her accusations, in September.</p>
        <p>The Army made no announcement withdrawing his name, but on Friday the Army's chief of staff, Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, appointed another two-star general to take over the position, which has been filled temporarily by a brigadier general for nearly eight months.</p>
        <p>With the withdrawal of his appointment, General Smith's military career, which began in 1966 and included three tours in Vietnam, appears all but over.</p>
        <p>The Army's decision to replace General Smith, however, came before the formal investigation of the general had been completed.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, Army investigators told Army leaders that they had substantiated General Kennedy's accusation that General Smith touched her in an inappropriate way and tried to kiss her at the end of a meeting in her office at the Pentagon, defense officials said.</p>
        <p>But General Smith, who is said to have denied making a sexual advance, has the right to challenge the findings, and Army officials have indicated that he plans to do so. General Smith has not publicly discussed the investigation and did not respond to a request for comment today.</p>
        <p>Army officials have said the accusations, if proved, do not rise to the level of criminal conduct punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Even if he is ultimately exonerated, it is not clear that General Smith will have a position to move into, officials said.</p>
        <p>Army officials made the decision to find another officer to fill the deputy inspector general's position months ago, the officials said. They said Army leaders realized that General Smith's appointment could not go forward given the publicity created by the accusations.</p>
        <p>One official insisted that the appointment of the officer, Maj. Gen. Joseph R. Inge, was not directly related to the continuing investigation, emphasizing that the Army had not yet decided on what punishment, if any, General Smith faced.</p>
        <p>For the last two years, General Inge has served as commander of the Army's 9th Theater Support Command, based in Japan. Because the appointment does not include a promotion in rank, it does not require confirmation by the Senate.</p>
        <p>The announcement, made when General Shinseki's office released a list of new appointments, did not specify when General Inge would start. But officials said the officer who has temporarily filled the job while the investigation moved forward, Brig. Gen. Daniel A. Doherty, planned to retire soon.</p>
        <p>The case has been an embarrassment for the Army, which has been battered by sexual misconduct cases in recent years.</p>
        <p>General Kennedy, the first woman in the Army to rise to the rank of lieutenant general, did not file a complaint at the time she says the incident took place. She raised her accusation only in September. Her friends have said she was concerned about General Smith's appointment to a position responsible, among other things, for investigating accusations of sexual harassment.</p>
        <p>At the time, both officers were major generals. General Smith, who rose through the Army's cavalry and armored ranks, was serving as the manager of the Saudi Arabian National Guard Modernization Program, which has provided training and equipment to elite Saudi forces since the 1970's.</p>
        <p>General Kennedy was serving as the assistant deputy chief of staff for intelligence. In 1997, she was given her third star and promoted to deputy chief, responsible for coordinating intelligence reports for commanders.</p>
        <p>The Army's decision leaves General Smith in an even more perilous limbo. His appointment, made in August, never took place. Since the investigation began, he has served officially as a special assistant to the director of the Army staff, attached to the Materiel Command in Alexandria, Va.</p>
        <p>The Army's vice chief of staff, Gen. John M. Keane, who is responsible for meting out punishment in cases like these, has received the investigators' findings. If he accepts them, he is likely to reprimand General Smith and force him to retire.</p>
        <p>An Army spokesman, Col. Edwin F. Veiga, declined today to discuss the status of the investigation.</p>
        <p>General Kennedy plans to retire this summer. Her last day as deputy chief of staff is June 2.</p>
