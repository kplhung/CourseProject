        <p>Despite a rare public thrashing by some of his fellow Democrats, New York State's Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, managed to hold onto his job yesterday as one of the top three leaders in Albany. Mr. Silver triumphed after a feverish bargaining for loyalties in the last few days that surprised even some legislative veterans in its passion and divisiveness. In the end, however, Mr. Silver should understand that this revolt was not merely about exchanging speakers. It was about changing the closed and undemocratic methods that strangle the legislative process in Albany.</p>
        <p>The former Assembly majority leader, Michael Bragman, who mounted the unsuccessful challenge to Mr. Silver, muscled his revolt all the way to the floor of the Assembly yesterday, where speakers took turns excoriating and defending Mr. Silver. Despite the victory, Mr. Silver has probably lost power, not only in his own chamber but in his ability to negotiate with Gov. George Pataki and his Republican allies.</p>

        <p>Despite a rare public thrashing by some of his fellow Democrats, New York State's Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, managed to hold onto his job yesterday as one of the top three leaders in Albany. Mr. Silver triumphed after a feverish bargaining for loyalties in the last few days that surprised even some legislative veterans in its passion and divisiveness. In the end, however, Mr. Silver should understand that this revolt was not merely about exchanging speakers. It was about changing the closed and undemocratic methods that strangle the legislative process in Albany.</p>
        <p>The former Assembly majority leader, Michael Bragman, who mounted the unsuccessful challenge to Mr. Silver, muscled his revolt all the way to the floor of the Assembly yesterday, where speakers took turns excoriating and defending Mr. Silver. Despite the victory, Mr. Silver has probably lost power, not only in his own chamber but in his ability to negotiate with Gov. George Pataki and his Republican allies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman argued passionately that the loss of Mr. Silver's control over everything from ''paper clips to chairmanships'' was vital for the Assembly. Having been stripped of his leadership position and the extra pay that goes with it, Mr. Bragman said he felt free to charge the Silver camp with brazenly threatening to mount primary challenges or reapportion districts of members who failed to support the sitting speaker. The Silver team denies such tactics, but the speaker's moves last week to punish Mr. Bragman and two of his friends made the charges believable to many members of the Assembly.</p>
        <p>From his position as a legislator with nothing to lose, Mr. Bragman has also proposed a good start to reforming the way Democrats have done business under Mr. Silver. He generally supports more power for legislators of both parties to propose, or at least have a say in, legislation. As it is now, Mr. Silver, Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, and Governor Pataki tightly control the outcome of Albany's laws while most members offer little more than a backdrop to their decisions. One questionable item on the Bragman list is a secret vote for speaker, a proposal that is understandable, given Mr. Silver's retributions. However, this is not a time for adding to Albany's clandestine tendencies.</p>
        <p>One result of the Bragman rebellion is that Mr. Silver now has about 20 fewer Democrats firmly in his pocket. That loss may help open the legislative process not only to other Democratic members but also to the Republican minority. Mr. Silver should not run the Assembly alone any more than his Republican counterpart should run the Senate alone. Mr. Silver is on notice that his colleagues want a fundamental reform known as representative democracy.</p>
