        <p>Those of us raised on dour postwar performances of Bartok's music tend to forget that he was musically the child of Liszt and, by proxy, of Wagner as well. Thus, ''Bluebeard's Castle,'' as witnessed by Sunday's concert performance by the Met Orchestra at Carnegie Hall, is by virtue of its size and extravagance a closer cousin to Schoenberg's mammoth ''Gurrelieder'' than to the tersely beautiful string quartets that were to come.</p>
        <p>Conceived as an opera just before World War I, ''Bluebeard's Castle'' is an enigmatic hybrid. With a highly literate text that bears as much weight as the music itself, with only two characters and with a format that virtually excludes stage action in favor of dialogue, Bartok makes a theater of his orchestra part.</p>

        <p>Those of us raised on dour postwar performances of Bartok's music tend to forget that he was musically the child of Liszt and, by proxy, of Wagner as well. Thus, ''Bluebeard's Castle,'' as witnessed by Sunday's concert performance by the Met Orchestra at Carnegie Hall, is by virtue of its size and extravagance a closer cousin to Schoenberg's mammoth ''Gurrelieder'' than to the tersely beautiful string quartets that were to come.</p>
        <p>Conceived as an opera just before World War I, ''Bluebeard's Castle'' is an enigmatic hybrid. With a highly literate text that bears as much weight as the music itself, with only two characters and with a format that virtually excludes stage action in favor of dialogue, Bartok makes a theater of his orchestra part.</p>
        <p>A production at the Aix-en-Provence festival a few summers ago used choreography as an eye enhancer and to good effect. Yet two motionless singers in front of an orchestra do as well if not better, especially when they offer the qualities of a Samuel Ramey and Anne Sofie von Otter and have for a conductor the likes of James Levine. Bela Balazs's play is a subtle inquiry into psychological sadomasochism. Bluebeard here is reluctant to open his seven doors to a new bride. Judith's insistence mixes dread with persistence. It is as if a third force compels them both toward their separate obligations of murder and victimization.</p>
        <p>Bartok uses instruments both to underline words and to describe what an opera stage would be hard pressed to do. Bluebeard's armory thunders; his torture chamber emits loud shrieks; his treasury of gold and jewels shimmers with chiming arpeggios, and his flower garden with shuddering held notes in the strings and ornamented wind parts. Bartok's ear for orchestral color, more famously demonstrated in the Concerto for Orchestra played after intermission, was with him from the start.</p>
        <p>''Bluebeard's Castle,'' done with this kind of virtuosity and conducted with such patience and concentration, becomes an apt postlude to late Romanticism. But if Bartok's formats are Germanic, his music is not. Rejected is the gluttony for detail; embraced is a singing lyrical style that relishes the Hungarian language and is redolent with a very un-German musical culture. Mr. Ramey and Ms. von Otter were extraordinary.</p>
        <p>The Concerto for Orchestra is one of those unsolicited bursts of sunshine that appear at the end of troubled lives. (Beethoven's last quartet is one, Verdi's ''Falstaff'' another.) Bartok was ill and dying in an America that tried but failed to treat him with due deference, but by the end of another world war he had produced this amalgam of tenderness, Hungarian wildness and shrewd humor. The orchestra effects are wonderful. Franz Lehar is cheerfully evoked, and Shostakovich rudely mocked. Mr. Levine worked hard to sort out the fugal textures of the racing finale, but so labored was the effort that one wished for the customary blur.</p>
        <p>Raymond Gniewek, playing as concertmaster for the last time, was warmly greeted by this big and appreciative audience. The dramatic reading of the prologue was by Joseph Krenusz, the Metropolitan Opera's assistant chief usher.</p>
