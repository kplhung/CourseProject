        <p>Declaring for the first time that programming on cable television is entitled to the highest level of First Amendment protection, the Supreme Court today struck down a federal law that required many cable systems to limit sexually explicit channels to late-night hours.</p>
        <p>The vote was 5 to 4, with an unusual lineup of justices, in a decision that, beyond the context of cable television, could pose obstacles to government efforts to regulate content in new media. Both sides agreed that shielding children from sexually explicit material, the purpose of the 1996 law, was a legitimate goal, but differed on the degree of constitutional ''flexibility'' the court should give the government in its effort to protect children.</p>
        <p>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Kennedy's opinion discussed the ''basic speech principles'' he said were at stake in the case, a challenge brought by Playboy Magazine's sexually oriented cable operations, which include Spice, AdulTVision, Adam &amp; Eve and the Playboy channel.</p>
        <p>''The history of the law of free expression is one of vindication in cases involving speech that many citizens may find shabby, offensive or even ugly,'' Justice Kennedy said. He added, ''The citizen is entitled to seek out or reject certain ideas or influences without government interference or control.''</p>
        <p>Tony Lynn, president of the Playboy Entertainment Group, said he expected his channels' distribution to grow because of the ruling.</p>
        <p>Playboy's largest cable channel, Playboy TV, is available in 24 million of the nation's 81 million homes that receive either satellite, cable or digital television, Mr. Lynn said. The network was not in more homes, he said, because many cable companies did not want to use channel space for programming that was only available during part of the day.</p>
        <p>''Now that we've got the shackles off, we're going to have an ability to do business with our consumers when they want to see us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The dissenters were Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Antonin Scalia, who wrote dissenting opinions, and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who signed the dissent. ''Our prior cases recognize that where the protection of children is at issue, the First Amendment poses a barrier that properly is high, but not insurmountable,'' Justice Breyer said.</p>
        <p>At issue in the case, United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, No. 98-1682, was the validity of Section 505 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The section was intended to address the problem of ''signal bleed,'' caused by a cable system's failure to scramble a signal well enough to avoid a fuzzy image or some sound from coming through to those subscribers who have not paid for a channel and do not want it.</p>
        <p>Section 505 required that for a channel ''primarily dedicated to sexually-oriented programming,'' a cable system that lacked the technology to block the signal completely had to limit the channel to hours when children were unlikely to be watching. A Federal Communications Commission regulation set the time as between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., and many cable systems chose that ''safe harbor'' option rather than investing in the technology needed for complete blocking.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the law contained another approach in a separate section, Section 504, under which cable operators had to provide an effective blocking device for any subscriber who wanted one.</p>
        <p>A Federal District Court in Wilmington, Del., ruling in 1998 in Playboy's challenge to the law, held that Section 504 could protect customers just as well without being as intrusive as the systemwide time segregation required by Section 505.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the court said, Section 505 was not the ''least restrictive means'' to achieve the government's goal, and was unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>In his opinion affirming that decision, Justice Kennedy made several points that could limit the government's ability to regulate content in new communications technologies.</p>
        <p>In applying ''strict scrutiny,'' the highest level of First Amendment protection, to cable programming, Justice Kennedy identified what he called a ''key difference'' between cable and broadcast television and radio, for which the court has applied a lower level of scrutiny and permitted more regulatory leeway.</p>
        <p>Unlike the broadcast media, cable systems have the capacity for ''target blocking,'' he said, adding: ''Technology expands the capacity to choose; and it denies the potential of this revolution if we assume the government is best positioned to make these choices for us.''</p>
        <p>Robert Corn-Revere, a lawyer who represented Playboy, said today that this analysis would also apply to the Internet and could prove important in turning back efforts to regulate speech in cyberspace.</p>
        <p>The majority of judges today also rejected the Clinton administration's defense of Section 505 as necessary because parents could not be counted on to request individual blocking devices from their cable company. That was an unwarranted assumption, Justice Kennedy said, adding, ''Even upon the assumption that the government has an interest in substituting itself for informed and empowered parents, its interest is not sufficiently compelling to justify this widespread restriction on speech.''</p>
        <p>There were also these other developments on a busy day at the court.</p>
        <p>Airbag Suits</p>
        <p>Dividing 5 to 4, the court ruled that manufacturers of cars made before federal law required airbags cannot be sued under state negligence laws for failing to have the safety devices.</p>
        <p>The case, Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., No. 98-1811, was the latest in a particularly contentious and unpredictable area of the court's docket, federal preemption of various state court lawsuits.</p>
        <p>Justice Breyer wrote the majority decision, which upheld a ruling last year by the federal appeals court here that a suit against Honda for failing to include an airbag in a 1987 Accord was pre-empted by the federal regulation in effect at that time that permitted a gradual phase-in of passive restraints.</p>
        <p>In the dissenting opinion, Justice Stevens charged the majority with an ''unprecedented extension of the doctrine of pre-emption that failed to treat state court systems with proper respect.''</p>
        <p>The majority opinion was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and by Justices O'Connor, Scalia, and Kennedy. Justices Souter, Thomas and Ginsburg joined the dissent.</p>
        <p>Employment Disputes</p>
        <p>Stepping into an issue of growing importance in labor-management relations, the court agreed to decide whether employers can enforce binding arbitration agreements that employees are increasingly required to sign as a condition of being hired.</p>
        <p>The question in Circuit City Stores v. Adams, No. 99-1379, is whether the Federal Arbitration Act, a 1925 law that excludes certain employment contracts from its coverage, applies to ordinary labor agreements of this type. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, held in this case that arbitration as part of an ordinary employment contract could not be enforced. All other federal courts to address the issue have found such agreements enforceable. Nearly 10 percent of the American work force is covered by mandatory arbitration agreements, according to the National Academy of Arbitrators.</p>
