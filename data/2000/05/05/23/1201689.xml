        <p>In quitting the Senate race last week, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani discovered that choosing a therapy for prostate cancer was a far more daunting effort than he had expected. Mr. Giuliani said he had to focus entirely on the decision, letting his immediate political future fall by the wayside.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's difficulties spring largely from a radical change in the relationship between patients and their doctors. Americans have traded in paternalism for medical consumerism after fighting for a greater voice in making critical decisions about their care. That has not come without cost.</p>
        <p>Making crucial decisions in one's own care has become increasingly complex. Tests now detect certain diseases like prostate cancer earlier, increasing chances for cure. Treatment choices are wider. Yet, for prostate cancer, doctors may not know which treatment is best.</p>
        <p>The changes are forcing many people to assume a degree of responsibility for their care unknown to their parents, and many younger people are unprepared for the difficulties in making the choices.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's is a case in point. His father died in 1981 at 73 of prostate cancer. The full facts in the elder Mr. Giuliani's case are not known.</p>
        <p>But in that era, prostate cancer was usually not detected until it had spread and was well beyond any hope of cure. It also was an era when doctors decided the treatment, and few patients questioned them.</p>
        <p>In those days, doctors did not always tell patients that they had cancer. In this new era of medical consumerism, most cancer patients are told they have the disease.</p>
        <p>A blood test known as P.S.A., for prostate specific antigen, led to the detection of Mr. Giuliani's prostate cancer at an early stage. The test did not exist in his father's lifetime. Thus, its use has forced Mr. Giuliani to make decisions his father never had to consider.</p>
        <p>Prostate cancer patients like Joe Torre, the New York Yankees manager, have told Mr. Giuliani about their experiences. And with his take-charge personality, Mr. Giuliani has sought medical advice from a number of doctors throughout the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani found that urologists and radiation oncologists tend to champion their specialties and present medical information in subtle ways intended to sway patients to their fields. Those circumstances made the effort of becoming an informed patient complex, frustrating and overwhelming, Mr. Giuliani said.</p>
        <p>Patients differ in how they make medical decisions. Many prostate cancer patients who wish to start treatment immediately settle on one within days of learning the diagnosis. Many others, over their heads in the morass of medical nuance, need more time.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Giuliani learned he had prostate cancer he was caught up in crucial political and personal decisions. He found himself simultaneously tackling four jobs -- mayor, unofficial candidate for the Senate, dealing with marital difficulties, and being a cancer patient.</p>
        <p>Three or so weeks would be enough time to choose a treatment and judge how it would affect his campaigning, Mr. Giuliani thought in his initial timetable.</p>
        <p>But his other problems distracted him from focusing on the medical decision, he said. In confronting his mortality, he found making medical decisions much tougher than making budgetary or legal decisions and the most difficult and painful of his life.</p>
        <p>Whether or not prostate cancer was the sole reason for his dropping out of the race, there is no question about the difficult choices Mr. Giuliani confronted.</p>
        <p>''I didn't understand the impact of this,'' Mr. Giuliani said.</p>
        <p>Prostate cancer ranks second to skin cancer as the most common malignancy among men. It usually grows slowly and can take years before proving fatal. The problem is that doctors do not know how to tell which patient most needs early aggressive treatment and which can wait. Thus, many more men are treated for prostate cancer than would die from it had they not been treated at all. Under such circumstances, doctors do not consider it risky for patients to spend several weeks choosing a therapy.</p>
        <p>Still, choosing a therapy for prostate cancer is particularly difficult because the crucial head-to-head studies that could provide important answers have not been carried out. Instead, patients have to rely on broad statistics that many feel may not apply to them.</p>
        <p>Men with prostate cancer find themselves in a position similar to the situation women with breast cancer faced a few years ago. Decisions eased only when crucial studies were completed to show that lumpectomy plus adjuvant drugs and radiation was an effective alternative to radical mastectomy for early breast cancer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani is considering two main treatments: surgery to remove the prostate or radiation to destroy it. Until last Friday, Mr. Giuliani had to speculate about which therapy would get him back on the senatorial campaign trail fastest and with fewest complications.</p>
        <p>Many men can do some routine desk work a few days after prostate surgery. But it takes at least three weeks before they can travel, and then many must deal with urinary incontinence and frequent diaper changes. Adding to the complexity is that after surgeons remove a prostate, pathologists look at it through a microscope for malignant cells. If they find the cancer has spread, radiation therapy may also be needed.</p>
        <p>There are two types of radiation for prostate cancer, and neither would seriously interfere with Mr. Giuliani's work as mayor. Yet each would have posed problems for campaigning.</p>
        <p>In one form of radiation, doctors use needles for permanently implanting radioactive ''seeds'' into the prostate. Radiation wears off after several months. Because such patients emit tiny amounts of radiation, they are warned to avoid continued close contact with pregnant women and children. That is not a major problem for most people.</p>
        <p>The amount of radiation in a fleeting exposure can be less than the amount of radiation in the environment. Nevertheless, if blown out of proportion, it could become a liability for a hand-shaking, baby-kissing politician in a campaign.</p>
        <p>The second form is external radiation. For prostate cancer, it is usually given five days a week for eight weeks. During that time, a patient can work regular hours. But the patient is confined to the geographic area in which he is being treated.</p>
        <p>Presumably, Mr. Giuliani weighed such factors heavily as a prospective senatorial candidate.</p>
