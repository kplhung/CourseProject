      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Supreme Court agreed today to hear a  clean air case that casts a constitutional shadow over the ability of federal agencies to administer programs within broad grants of authority from Congress.</p>
        <p>In its appeal of a ruling overturning two major clean air standards, the Clinton administration said the decision last May by a three-judge panel of the federal appeals court here was a ''radical departure from settled law'' that raised ''issues of extraordinary governmental concern.''</p>
        <p>The appeal, to be argued next fall, has the potential to be not only one of the most important cases on the court's docket for its next term, but also one of the most important cases in decades about the allocation of authority in the modern administrative state.</p>
        <p>In invalidating new standards that the Environmental Protection Agency adopted in 1997 for ozone and small airborne particles, the appeals court held that the Clean Air Act, as interpreted by the agency, provided so little guidance as to amount to an unconstitutional delegation of law-making authority by Congress. The 2-to-1 decision was the first time that a federal regulatory program had been struck down under the ''nondelegation doctrine'' since 1935, when the Supreme Court invoked it to invalidate two New Deal programs.</p>
        <p>Since then, led by the Supreme Court in its post-New Deal stance toward agency discretion, federal courts have generally deferred to administrative agencies' interpretations of their authority under their governing statutes, many of which are as open-ended as the Clean Air Act, if not more so.</p>
        <p>The Clean Air Act, which dates to 1970, directs the Environmental Protection Agency to set national air quality standards at levels that ''in the judgment of the administrator'' and ''allowing an adequate margin of safety'' are ''requisite to protect the public health.'' If that mandate amounts to an unconstitutional delegation, experts in administrative law have warned, then so do the broad marching orders Congress has given to agencies like the Federal Communications Commission, which is charged with regulating broadcasting in light of ''public interest, convenience and necessity.''</p>
        <p>In striking down the clean air regulations, the appeals court said the environmental agency lacked ''any determinate criterion for drawing lines'' and was ''free to pick any point between zero and a hair below the concentrations yielding London's Killer Fog,'' a reference to an air pollution crisis that killed 4,000 people in one week in 1952.</p>
        <p>The nondelegation doctrine grew out of concern for the constitutional separation of powers, and has received expressions of support in earlier cases from Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia. The argument for the doctrine is that it helps maintain political accountability by preventing Congress from legislating in broad generalities while avoiding responsibility for unpopular regulations.</p>
        <p>The ozone and small particle regulations at issue in this case, Browner v. American Trucking Associations, No. 99-1257, were decidedly unpopular in the business community, which argued before the appeals court that the new standards would impose huge costs on regulated industries without proportional benefits to public health.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court has never ruled on whether the Clean Air Act permits, or requires, a cost-benefit analysis. The American Trucking Associations, United States Chamber of Commerce and other industry groups, while agreeing with the Clinton administration that the court should hear the administration's appeal, have filed a separate appeal urging the justices to adopt a cost-benefit interpretation of the statute.</p>
        <p>The court did not act today on that separate appeal, which evidently remains under active consideration.</p>
        <p>Even aside from the nondelegation issue, this would be an important environmental case. The agency tightened the existing standards for ozone and for the first time adopted a standard for small, sooty particles, a major component of smog. The American Lung Association participated in the case at the appeals court level to defend the new standards as important public health measures, as did the states of New Jersey and Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>The case pits the Northeastern states against the Midwestern industrial states whose emissions reach the Northeast on the prevailing winds. In addition to Massachusetts and New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont have all filed or signed briefs in support of the regulations, while Ohio, Michigan, and West Virginia are supporting the industry plaintiffs.</p>
