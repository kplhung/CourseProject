        <p>The results of an undetermined number of legislative races from the election on Sunday may have to be voided because ballots were either damaged, lost or left susceptible to fraud when tired and poorly trained poll workers dumped hundreds of ballot boxes in a jumble outside of electoral offices, officials said today.</p>
        <p>Officials at several Communal Electoral Offices, known by the French acronym BEC, arrived at work to discover that the ballot boxes had been left there overnight because poll workers could not find room for them inside. Some boxes were open, and thousands of ballots and other documents were found scattered on the sidewalk or street.</p>
        <p>International election observers said the chaotic delivery of ballots could make recounts impossible in some areas if there were close margins or if the official tally sheets, which were supposed to have been delivered separately, were contested because of irregularities.</p>
        <p>''The votes cannot be recounted because everybody is treading on them,'' said Mary Durran, the spokeswoman for the observer mission from the Organization of American States. ''It seems the vote will have to be canceled in a number of polling stations in the BEC's of Port-au-Prince.''</p>
        <p>Workers outside the electoral office in the Delmas neighborhood spent the morning piling up ballot boxes into a six-foot mound. Handwritten lists were scattered about in some places, while workers scooped up handfuls of scattered ballots and put them back into boxes. ''There was no place to store them in the building, and it was late in the night when they brought the boxes here,'' said Jean-Louis Fritz, the lawyer for the Provisional Electoral Council, which organized the elections, the country's first in three years. ''The police helped them to do their job, but they were very busy. They put them here and left.''</p>
        <p>The possibility of fraud has always been a worry in a cumbersome electoral process where votes are tallied by hand. Some opposition parties had expressed fears that Family Lavalas, the party of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, would try to manipulate the vote. But election observers found no evidence of that, noting that in some cases damaged Lavalas ballots  were clearly visible on the street.</p>
