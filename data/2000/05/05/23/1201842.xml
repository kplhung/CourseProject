        <p>Mark Jackson could not resist taking a couple of subtle shots at his old friend Patrick Ewing when the Indiana Pacers met with reporters today to discuss Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals.</p>
        <p>Each time Jackson was asked a question about the Knicks center in which the reference was simply ''Patrick,'' he would look at the questioner and say, ''Ewing,'' as if he were trying to clarify that the person under discussion was not, say, Patrick Moynihan or Patrick Rafter.</p>
        <p>But the Indiana point guard made no attempt at levity when asked if he empathized with Ewing's physical and emotional travails over the past few years and his long-frustrated quest to win a National Basketball Association championship.</p>
        <p>''I definitely feel for what he's gone through physically, mentally, the abuse that he's gone through in New York,'' Jackson said. ''He simply is, in my opinion, and I go way back, the greatest New York Knick to ever put on a uniform, and I think the numbers will indicate that when it's all said and done.''</p>
        <p>Jackson then took Ewing's doubters to task for failing to see what he sees in Ewing.</p>
        <p>''I don't think he's appreciated as much as he should be,'' Jackson said. ''Here's a guy who plays hurt and continues to play hurt. He's a warrior, a phenomenal teammate, with a tremendous heart. I don't have any sympathy for him; I have tremendous admiration and respect for him. I'm proud of the way he stands as a man and as a basketball player. His career speaks for itself.''</p>
        <p>But Jackson could not leave his remarks as pure platitudes. What fun would that be? So, he took out the needle one more time and jabbed his good friend with it.</p>
        <p>''It's just good to know that one of us will be playing in the finals,'' he said, before pausing for the proper effect. ''And I'll represent him well.''</p>
        <p>Pacers Ready for Challenge</p>
        <p>The Pacers are in the Eastern Conference finals for the fifth time in seven seasons but have still not made it to the league finals. The players are a little weary of hearing about it, but Coach Larry Bird is not afraid to talk about it or attach a sense of urgency to this year's trip.</p>
        <p>''We've been saying that for three years, but I think it's true this year,'' Bird said. ''With all the free agents we have, you don't know what kind of team you're going to have next year. I think it's very important for this franchise to take the next step. This year we're pretty healthy, playing with a lot of confidence. We didn't have a long layoff, so I think it's time to step up and go forward.''</p>
