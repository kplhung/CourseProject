        <p>1. CAMBY'S CONSISTANCY</p>
        <p>The spindly forward slipped through the cracks of the Pacers' front line last year and became the team's impact player in the Knicks' playoff romp. If he is to reprise his role as Larry Bird's nightmare, he will have to finish around the basket stronger than he did against the Miami Heat. He rebounded well, but was a puny 12 for 30 from the floor, often resorting to timid putbacks and rushed tap-ins. Just dunk it. There is no intimidating Zo in Indiana. It is only Rik Smits.</p>
        <p>2. KEEP UP WITH REGGIE MILLER</p>

        <p>1. CAMBY'S CONSISTANCY</p>
        <p>The spindly forward slipped through the cracks of the Pacers' front line last year and became the team's impact player in the Knicks' playoff romp. If he is to reprise his role as Larry Bird's nightmare, he will have to finish around the basket stronger than he did against the Miami Heat. He rebounded well, but was a puny 12 for 30 from the floor, often resorting to timid putbacks and rushed tap-ins. Just dunk it. There is no intimidating Zo in Indiana. It is only Rik Smits.</p>
        <p>2. KEEP UP WITH REGGIE MILLER</p>
        <p>Allan Houston will have to find a miracle cure for his sore left ankle to stay close to the re-energized Miller. His languid regular season behind him, Miller is back popping off the hard screens set by Dale Davis and Smits and delivering from every angle behind the arc. Houston did well shadowing Miller in the playoffs last year (holding him to 36.3 percent from the field) and outscored him along the way. This year, it is a new challenge on a bad foot.</p>
        <p>3. PROTECT THE 3-POINT LINE</p>
        <p>Unlike the Toronto Raptors and the Heat, the Pacers are not likely to fire as aimlessly as often from the 3-point line. They shot 40 percent from that range for the season -- the best in the league -- and have three players who have tortured the Knicks' often inattentive transition defense with a flurry of 3's. During the regular season, Sam Perkins (3 for 5), Chris Mullin (4 for 7) and Mark Jackson (4 for 7), ate up the Kincks on the perimeter. While the feisty Knick guards love to dig in the paint and help inside, they can not leave the Pacers open to beat them. Because they will.</p>
        <p>4. FIGHT OFF PASSIVE TENDENCIES</p>
        <p>The Knicks tend to become a jump-shooting team when an opponent lets them. The Knicks shot a robust 48 percent against Indiana in the regular season, but lost two of the four games because they forgot how to get to the foul line. Patrick Ewing, Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell combined for 28 free-throw attempts against the Pacers while Miller went to the line 30 times by himself against the Knicks. The Knicks have been at their best during the playoffs when they drive the ball, kick it out or go in for a layup. They can not afford to get jumpshot happy.</p>
        <p>5. SHUT DOWN ROSE</p>
        <p>The Pacers' versatile southpaw is always trouble for the Knicks. During the regular season, Jeff Van Gundy played musical chairs with his defense in an effort to stop Indiana's leading scorer this season. Sprewell has trouble with him in the post, Camby tends to foul him and Larry Johnson can get beat by Rose's speed. Of the three, Johnson has had the most success. Still, Rose is capable of the kind of 28-point night he had against the Knicks on March 21. The best defense the Knicks have in their favor: Rose can disappear at any moment.</p>
