        <p>DAVID ALLAKHVERDOV was 12 years old the last time this newspaper talked to him, and some things have not changed in five years. He still doesn't have a tuxedo. (He gets by with a bow tie and a dark suit.) He still doesn't have a good piano at home in the Bronx. (''The good ones, $30,000, at least!'' says his father, Vitaliy.)</p>
        <p>He still has an astounding amount of hair for someone his size. Think Horshak from ''Welcome Back, Kotter.'' (''In classical music,'' David explains, his English still a little choppy, ''you should have lot of hair. It make you look like a star.'')</p>
        <p>Most important, David still does what first brought him to this newspaper's attention: once a week, he lugs an electric piano into the subway, puts fingers to keys and instantly makes crowds of sour-faced subway riders stop and smile, almost against their will, as if hundred-dollar bills were being handed out.</p>
        <p>But in the years since his last interview, David Allakhverdov has managed to find an accompaniment more fitting than the clack of the No. 2 train: a 65-piece orchestra.</p>
        <p>First, a little recent history. With the help of his teacher, the concert pianist Seymour Lipkin, who got in touch with David after hearing about his playing in the subway, David auditioned four years ago for the highly competitive pre-college program at Juilliard.</p>
        <p>He played with passion. He played with all the skill that made subway riders call him ''Little Mozart.''</p>
        <p>He did not make the cut.</p>
        <p>''A teacher in Russia, she once told me that I should get into Juilliard,'' David said. ''It might be impossible, but I should try. And so, since I was young, I was always thinking that Juilliard is something way ahead of what I can do, that it is something too gorgeous.''</p>
        <p>But the disappointment, Mr. Lipkin recalled, only seemed to draw out of David the kind of determination that may one day make him a great pianist. ''He just dug his heels in,'' Mr. Lipkin said. ''He worked hard for a year, and then he made it.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''Of course, there would be no question now of whether he belonged in there.''</p>
        <p>For example: A year after he got in, David won an honors recital competition, playing Shostakovich. He won a $5,000 scholarship from a nonprofit philanthropic group. He started having to balance subway performances and school (he is a junior at La Guardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, across the street from Juilliard) with demands for solo recitals.</p>
        <p>Then last month, he beat out 10 other young Juilliard finalists for a spot as the soloist for Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 1 with the Pre-College Symphony, part of a concert held on Saturday at the Juilliard Theater.</p>
        <p>It was the first time that David had played with an orchestra, though in truth he had been practicing the Chopin No. 1 with a boombox in the subway for several months, and in his head and heart for much longer.</p>
        <p>''He just had himself set on this a year ago,'' Mr. Lipkin said, ''and to tell you the truth, I didn't know if he could manage it at the time.'' His verdict after Saturday's concert: ''My gosh, didn't he do it nicely?''</p>
        <p>''Chopin,'' he added. ''It really is his home territory. The Russians are very, very congenial to him.''</p>
        <p>THIS is because the Allakhverdov family (pronounced al-lock-VARE-tof) immigrated from the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan in 1994, as the Uzbek majority began to make life difficult for families like theirs. (They are mostly Armenian.)</p>
        <p>In Tashkent, the capital, Mr. Allakhverdov and his wife, Larisa, were doctors and lived very comfortably. But when they came to the United States, settling in the Bronx near the Yonkers border, they struggled to learn English so they could take exams to practice in New York.</p>
        <p>They still live in the crowded bottom half of a two-family house. To make ends meet, Mr. Allakhverdov, an amateur pianist who was his son's first teacher, still puts aside his slightly stern physician's demeanor and sings in Russian restaurants.</p>
        <p>But things are slowly turning around. Mrs. Allakhverdov -- as friendly and persistent a stage mother as you are ever likely to find (she faxes reporters not only articles written about David, but also his Juilliard grades) -- recently passed her state exams and will begin working at Interfaith Medical Center as a resident in internal medicine.</p>
        <p>David's brother, Arthur, 22, will begin medical school in the fall. His sister, Christine, 21, is finishing a nursing program, and Mr. Allakhverdov devotes most of his time to managing David's blossoming career.</p>
        <p>Then there is David, who could not be happier, despite the fact that he still has no girlfriend. (''I guess the piano, she is my girlfriend,'' he says, slouching even more than usual and rolling his eyes.)</p>
        <p>Last Friday, at the last rehearsal before the Chopin concerto, David waited nervously for the Steinway grand to be rolled into place. Instead of fanning tux tails over the bench, he just yanked his long blue T-shirt down over his jeans and eased his white Nikes onto the pedals.</p>
        <p>When David finished the dramatic third movement -- a head-snapping, hair-tossing performance filled with breathtaking runs -- the symphony's conductor, Adam Glaser, waited for silence to fill the room and then simply pointed with the baton at the skinny young pianist.</p>
        <p>At Juilliard, the tradition is for students to applaud by stomping their feet. For a few seconds that evening, it sounded like a stampede.</p>
