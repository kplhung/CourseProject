        <p>Gruner &amp; Jahr, the publisher of seven consumer magazines in the United States including McCall's, Fitness and Parents, has named a chief executive, three months after the departure of its previous chief.</p>
        <p>Daniel B. Brewster, the president and chief executive of American Express Publishing, resigned from that job yesterday and will take over at Gruner &amp; Jahr on June 5. American Express Publishing, which is a partnership between the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner and the American Express Company, publishes four consumer magazines, including Food &amp; Wine and Travel &amp; Leisure.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Brewster, the challenge will be to bring vitality to a group of magazines that are not noted for their dynamism. Because of their subject matter, which is largely geared toward family, fitness, interior decorating and teenage entertainment -- they have missed out on two of the most abundant areas of magazine advertising: luxury goods and Internet businesses.</p>
        <p>Gruner &amp; Jahr publishes more than 80 magazines around the world, mostly in Europe. Its magazines in the United States have been particularly vulnerable to the recent changes in the consumer marketplace, specifically, the consolidation of newsstand wholesalers -- a trend that has by most estimates hurt the entire industry by driving up costs -- and the tremendous fall-off in subscriptions that had been generated in the past by American Family Publishers and Publishers Clearing House.</p>
        <p>The move to hire Mr. Brewster signals a significant shift in the company's strategy. Bertelsmann A.G., the German media company that owns 74.9 percent of Gruner &amp; Jahr, sold its stake in AOL Europe last year for about $8 billion, and Mr. Brewster has been given the task of routing a portion of that windfall into reviving the American magazine division.</p>
        <p>''They have given me an absolute commitment that they are going to substantially invest in their core titles,'' Mr. Brewster said yesterday. ''They will give me funding to pursue acquisitions, and we will also have sufficient resources to develop new products internally.''</p>
        <p>One of the company's first acquisitions may be Inc. magazine, executives involved in the negotiations said. Gruner &amp; Jahr has just entered the second round of bidding for the magazine.</p>
        <p>Time Inc. is also negotiating to buy Inc.; the asking price is $200 million, the executives said.</p>
        <p>Gruner &amp; Jahr's turnover rate has been among the highest in the magazine industry, according to past and current executives, with some employees -- including the last chief executive -- departing for Internet businesses. John Heins, the former chief executive, resigned in February to join Netscape as a vice president for international sales and marketing. In another recent departure, Andreas Wiele, the company's chief operating officer, resigned on May 9 to join Axel Springer Verlag, based in Hamburg, Germany.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brewster is a longtime employee of Time Inc. After beginning his career as a CNN correspondent covering Congress and as a producer for ABC News, Mr. Brewster joined Time Inc. in 1985 and worked through the ranks, from promotional director at People magazine to associate publisher of Life. He has been the chief executive of American Express Publishing since 1993.</p>
        <p>His replacement has not been named, but executives at American Express said that he had recommended Ed Kelly, the publisher of the Travel &amp; Leisure group, which publishes Travel &amp; Leisure and its spinoffs, T&amp;L Golf and Travel &amp; Leisure Family.</p>
