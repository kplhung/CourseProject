        <p>There is a special happiness hiding in hard lives that springs out of a dark corner at the end of Nancy Nevarez's ''Blind Alley'' (''Callejon Sin Salida'') and sends you away with a slightly guilty feeling of uplift. The secret of this magic springs partly from Ms. Nevarez's determination to offer no explanations or apologies and to seek no pity as she presents the lives of nine women in three acts -- actually three short plays that share a few themes expressed in vivid conflicts and powerful language.</p>
        <p>Two of the three segments have been seen in workshops over a few years. In the production by the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater all gain strength from being welded together. And Alex Furth, the director, gives them the rhythms of the streets and the speech of Spanish Harlem -- an effect not unlike music, even if the lyrics spring from injury and despondency.</p>
        <p>In the opening act, ''Hopscotch,'' two teenagers who want to avoid notice by the adult world while they take it over by stealth fairly sing to each other in the cool, coded language of the street, but they cannot conceal the gullibility and emotional tenderness of the young. They dodge bullets, hide from the police and see a friend shot, but their imaginations are inescapably dominated by teachers, mothers and grandparents and by the no-show father of one, who breaks the hearts of both on Christmas Eve.</p>
        <p>Mariana Carreno as Dee, a shy youngster who dreams of being whisked away to a new life in far-off if not downright foreign Philadelphia, and Monica Read as Haydee, a gang girl living in a box while her mother is in prison, inhabit their roles with infectious energy and shining innocence. All the troubles of the adult world, they understand, spring from sex, although their arguments over whether someone can catch a ''communicate disease'' from a blanket leaves one wondering what they think sex is. Ms. Read's revelation of Haydee's vulnerability under all her strut and swagger is very fine, and her demonstration of an exercise Haydee devised to keep warm is a breathtaking stand-in-place dance of such manic precision that it deserves the rousing cheer it receives.</p>
        <p>The mood turns much darker in Act II, ''A Place to Go.'' Two women (Ms. Read and Milena Davila), with reluctance rising to resentment, take another (Annie Henk) who faces death on the sidewalk without shelter into the freezing room where they are squatters. Amid so much misery, one squatter, who survives by prostitution, and the other, who uses her baby as a panhandling prop, can work up a damning contempt for the third for simply being beaten down by misfortune. But the prostitute's self-reliance turns out to be illusory, the woman with the baby is paralyzed by fear because she stole the child, and the only warmth the three can feel rises from shared memories of their own teenage years when they too were hopscotching through school.</p>
        <p>In the last segment, ''Sisters,'' four siblings with families and careers compete in familiar rituals of superiority, with a good deal of jealousy directed at the oldest sister, Bruni (Nancy Rodriguez). But as their sparring continues it turns out that they have spent their lives avoiding a childhood secret only Bruni understands: when she turned 12 their mother prostituted her to their landlord to pay the rent, and Bruni fought off her panic and disgust to turn rape into an affair that protected the younger girls from the same fate as they grew up.</p>
        <p>That such a story can be turned into a profound demonstration of the life-giving power of affection owes much to Ms. Nevarez's unyielding restraint in keeping the dialogue unaffectedly simple and to the ability of Ms. Rodriguez, Ms. Davila, Ms. Henk and Joselin Reyes to make a viewer feel the rapidly shifting emotions none of these women can bring themselves to talk about. All four performers seem to know, as if by instinct, precisely which emotions speak most eloquently when the text falls silent. As the lights go up, you feel with some amazement that you have been told much more than you yourself know how to say. That is one reason why walking away from this two-hour tour de force feels more like floating on air.</p>
        <p>''Blind Alley'' is performed in Spanish on weekends and in English from Wednesday through Friday. (Well, up a point: not all the wisecracks in ''Hopscotch'' are translatable, but anyone will know what they mean.)</p>
