        <p>Unbeholden to any calendar but that of its own fancy, the New York Festival of Song on Thursday gave its St Patrick's Day concert, a shamrock garland of traditional songs, more high-born numbers and less noble opera excerpts. Steven Blier was the accompanist throughout most of the evening, and also, as always, the engaging, witty and erudite commentator-host.</p>
        <p>His title for the evening was well chosen: ''Songs of the Irish Poets.'' As he pointed out, the English language in Irish mouths starts to sing even without music, and there were examples here all the way from Thomas Moore at the start of the 19th century (''At the mid hour of night, when stars are weeping'') to Paul Muldoon at the end of the 20th (''They're kindly here, to let us linger so late'').</p>

        <p>Unbeholden to any calendar but that of its own fancy, the New York Festival of Song on Thursday gave its St Patrick's Day concert, a shamrock garland of traditional songs, more high-born numbers and less noble opera excerpts. Steven Blier was the accompanist throughout most of the evening, and also, as always, the engaging, witty and erudite commentator-host.</p>
        <p>His title for the evening was well chosen: ''Songs of the Irish Poets.'' As he pointed out, the English language in Irish mouths starts to sing even without music, and there were examples here all the way from Thomas Moore at the start of the 19th century (''At the mid hour of night, when stars are weeping'') to Paul Muldoon at the end of the 20th (''They're kindly here, to let us linger so late'').</p>
        <p>These were songs of Irish poets but not, in the main, of Irish composers, who have always been scarce -- perhaps made redundant by the musicality of Irish speech. Drawn in to fill the gap here were such honorary and temporary Irishmen as Beethoven and Berlioz, Mendelssohn and Schumann, Barber and Britten, Daron Hagen and John Corigliano.</p>
        <p>Beethoven was first on the program, though stealing in before him came a bit of greener Irishness in some introductory fiddle playing by Paul Woodiel, who slipped neatly into classical mode as he joined Michael Barrett (piano) and Dorothy Lawson (cello) in the Beethoven settings of some Irish tunes. Mr. Barrett deftly brought out some robust and excited Beethovenian character in these overlooked pieces, and ''The Elfin Fairies'' was a real charmer, with both the evening's singers -- Amy Burton and Theodore Green -- in delightful voice.</p>
        <p>The two of them collaborated later in a sublimely foolish duet from Michael Balfe's opera ''The Bohemian Girl,'' of which the world is littered with dusty copies. Ms. Burton's radiant fineness, her bright tone and elegant, unaffected phrasing, had just before been on display in the one number from this score still remembered: ''I Dreamt That I Dwelt in Marble Halls.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Green, with his light, head-strong voice, could easily pass for an Irish tenor. In a wonderful Barber-Joyce song, ''Of That So Sweet Imprisonment,'' he was soft and gentle with the carefully modulated music -- music teasing out the Irish genes in American melody. In the rousing ballad ''Eileen Oge,'' he let rip, so confidently and thrillingly that he was called on to repeat the last verse.</p>
        <p>Other special moments included the songs on almost the same text, ''Wenn durch die Piazzetta,'' by Mendelssohn (sad and barcarolle-lilting) and Schumann (snappy and ironic, but then skimming off into the true-love distance).</p>
        <p>The encores were inevitable: Ms. Burton sweet and true in ''The Last Rose of Summer,'' Mr. Green frankly sentimental in ''Danny Boy.''</p>
