        <p>How do you respond when your boss yells at you? How do you feel when you are harshly criticized, even when it's accurate? Do you go out to do well or to prove the boss wrong? Or do you sulk and pout and perform even less effectively than you did before?</p>
        <p>Larry Robinson, boss-coach of the Devils, shouted an angry critique to his players last Saturday night when they lost to the Philadelphia Flyers in the Eastern Conference finals. On some teams, with some coaches, such a tirade could have brought a negative reaction. A team could have subtly quit and accepted elimination with a defeat in the next game.</p>

        <p>How do you respond when your boss yells at you? How do you feel when you are harshly criticized, even when it's accurate? Do you go out to do well or to prove the boss wrong? Or do you sulk and pout and perform even less effectively than you did before?</p>
        <p>Larry Robinson, boss-coach of the Devils, shouted an angry critique to his players last Saturday night when they lost to the Philadelphia Flyers in the Eastern Conference finals. On some teams, with some coaches, such a tirade could have brought a negative reaction. A team could have subtly quit and accepted elimination with a defeat in the next game.</p>
        <p>But these Devils didn't. Perhaps they knew he was right. Maybe they accepted his words more willingly because he so seldom yells and he so often played for championship teams in his career with the Montreal Canadiens.</p>
        <p>Whatever the reason, Robinson's Devils surged ahead early last night and rolled to a 4-1 victory over the Flyers that cut Philadelphia's lead to three games to two in the four-of-seven-game series that will resume tomorrow night at Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>When asked whether it was a gamble to blast his employees in such fashion, Robinson shrugged, smiled and asked: ''Why was it a gamble? What have I got to lose?''</p>
        <p>Only a game, a series, a season and the renaissance of a reputation that suffered from his four mediocre seasons as coach of the Los Angeles Kings. The Robinson of Year 2000, who replaced Robbie Ftorek with eight games left in the season, seems to know which buttons to punch and when to punch them. He got one goal each from the line of Jason Arnott, Patrik Elias and Peter Sykora. He got another from Bobby Holik, his third of the series.</p>
        <p>When asked if Robinson deserved some of the credit for this victory, Elias said: ''I think so. The way he talked to us, he let us know why we all got in the game, to accomplish something here, and we're really close and maybe we didn't realize it.''</p>
        <p>They have 10 victories so far in this Stanley Cup tournament and they are six away from repeating their championship of 1995. Holik, a member of that team, said Robinson repeated his Saturday-night comments before last night's game ''but in a quiet way.'' He wanted them to go to the net for close shots and to stay there for rebounds. He wanted them to maintain their positional formations and not take foolish chances.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, we did what he told us to do,'' Holik said. ''Play smart. Be more determined.''</p>
        <p>Did Holik ever worry that Robinson's strategy would backfire? ''I don't think any player here said 'Let's pack it in,' '' Holik said. ''Nobody said that and I believe nobody thought that.'' Holik led the team with five shots on goal and won 15 of 21 face-offs.</p>
        <p>Arnott, like Holik, is a big center, the kind of player needed to combat the bulk and desire of the Flyers, particularly with Daymond Langkow back tonight and Eric Lindros hoping to return after two months off from injury. Along with opening the scoring, Arnott had four shots on goal and afterward said of Robinson's Saturday speech:</p>
        <p>''We needed that. There's no question about it. We deserved what he said. I don't think anybody in there felt otherwise. We all took it to heart and said 'We've got to listen to this guy. We've been winning because we've been listening to him and, as soon as we stopped doing the things he's been telling us, we lose.' ''</p>
        <p>When asked how Robinson spoke to the team after tonight's victory, Arnott smiled and said: ''He was great. He's kind of low key. He said what he had to say and then he got out of the room. Tonight, he said we played a solid game and that was it.''</p>
        <p>They will need two more if they are to advance to the finals to face either Dallas or Colorado. The Flyers are still big and talented and they probably won't produce another clinker as they did last night. Craig Ramsay, their low-key coach, was asked if he addressed his players in harsh terms tonight.</p>
        <p>No, he did not. ''I'm very confident my players will come up with their best game,'' Ramsay said, referring to Game 6. ''So, I don't think they need to hear anything other than that.''</p>
        <p>Robinson, referring to his postgame yelling on Saturday, said: ''Sometimes you do, and it works. Sometimes you do, and it doesn't. This team responded very well. I'm a very fortunate person to be able to take over a group of guys who have listened and bought into what we as coaches have been trying to say. I'm very optimistic. We'll see what happens.''</p>
        <p>Shortly after this, Robinson walked to the bus and took the front seat on the right side for the ride up the Turnpike. In the figurative sense, Robinson was steady at the wheel and he had steered his group in the right direction.</p>
