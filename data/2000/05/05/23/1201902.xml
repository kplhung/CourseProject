        <p>Duffy Waldorf hopes that defending his Buick Classic championship brings out the best in his game.</p>
        <p>The Buick Classic will be held this year from June 8 to 11 at Westchester Country Club in Harrison, N.Y., a week before the United States Open in Pebble Beach, Calif. A strong field has already committed to play in the event, including Phil Mickelson, a three-time winner on the PGA Tour this year, Jesper Parnevik, Davis Love III, Ernie Els, Tom Lehman and Jim Furyk.</p>
        <p>Several prominent international players will also stop in New York to play the Buick on their way to Pebble Beach, including the reigning British Open champion, Paul Lawrie of Scotland, Jean Van de Velde of France and Shigeki Maruyama of Japan.</p>
        <p>The 1999 Buick Classic was a turning point for Waldorf, who jump-started his year by defeating Dennis Paulson in a playoff.</p>
