        <p>Aree and Naree Song Wongluekiet, twin sisters from Thailand, pause from hitting range balls and stand before a full-length mirror, applying sunscreen and casting reflections on their amazingly bright futures. Even at practice, absurdly premature expectations and questions seem to surround these 14-year-old golf prodigies.</p>
        <p>How soon will they turn pro? Will they challenge the Ladies Professional Golf Association's age requirement and petition for membership before age 18? Will they remain amateurs and go to college? With their substantial talent and millions of dollars in prize money waiting for them, why would they consider college?</p>
        <p>''If they do, if they're not good enough to turn pro at 18, they're going backward,'' said Gary Gilchrist, director of golf at the David Leadbetter Golf Academy, in Bradenton, Fla., where Aree and Naree have trained for almost three years.</p>
        <p>The Wongluekiet girls hit the fast-forward button in March after receiving special exemptions to compete in the Nabisco Championship, one of the tour's four major championships. Aree played her way into Sunday's final group with Karrie Webb and finished 10th, becoming the youngest player to enter, make the cut and finish that high in an L.P.G.A. major. Naree shot 74-82 and missed the cut.</p>
        <p>They are next scheduled to appear on the LPGA Tour at the Wegmans Rochester International June 8-11 at Locust Hill Country Club in Pittsford, N.Y. On June 13, the Wongluekiets will try to earn spots in the United States Women's Open in qualifying at Eagles Landing Country Club in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, even the sisters aren't sure what is ahead for their young careers. Under L.P.G.A. rules, they can enter a maximum of four events through sponsor's exemptions or qualifying. The Rochester tournament will be their third, following the Nabisco and the Subaru Memorial of Naples in Florida in February. The Women's Open would not count toward that total because it is a United States Golf Association event.</p>
        <p>''Our dream is to compete on the L.P.G.A. Tour and be one of the best players out there,'' Aree said before a practice at the Leadbetter Academy range.</p>
        <p>Naree added, ''We just need more time and experience.''</p>
        <p>The twins were clearly in no rush to grow up after a recent school day ended at Bradenton Academy, where they are the sophomore stars of the golf team. They are full-time students, too. They wake up at 6:45 a.m., and at 8 a.m. they begin their schedule of five classes: English, math, Spanish, history and science. They attend one study hall, eat a quick lunch and practice for four hours.</p>
        <p>''The family has been focused for many years,'' Gilchrist said. ''Their dad has sown the seed in their hearts that they can be something special, that they can be No. 1 in the world.''</p>
        <p>The Wongluekiets quickly climbed the national junior girls' ranking; Aree is now at No. 2 and Naree at No. 3. Last summer, they dominated the American Junior Golf Association circuit in their first year of eligibility, combining for eight victories (Aree 6, Naree 2) in 11 tournaments. They also finished second a combined five times.</p>
        <p>At the Nabisco, they received praise from Webb and Annika Sorenstam, the tour's top two players. Sorenstam called them incredible; Webb predicted that Aree and Naree will immediately shoot to the top of the LPGA Tour money list once they turn pro.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes, it can be tough,'' Aree said of the expectations. ''You just try to focus, block it out and try your best.''</p>
        <p>The twins' interest in the game began at 7 as a way to spend more time with their father, In Jong Song, and brother, Chan, at the golf club. In Jong was a member at each of the four courses in Chiangmai, the largest city in Thailand after Bangkok. Aree and Naree simply followed In Jong around and begged him to let them play.</p>
        <p>''They say, 'Father, why only the brother play golf, and we are not?' '' In Jong recalled. ''They really want to play golf, so I say, 'If you are going to play, you promise me you work hard and try to be No. 1 in the world, and then I will support it.' ''</p>
        <p>In Jong smiles and laughs at the memory. At the time, it seemed like an easy way to appease his daughters. As their talent blossomed, the need for world-class instruction became apparent, and In Jong made plans for the girls to attend the Leadbetter Academy, where Chan had enrolled one year earlier.</p>
        <p>In Jong sold his 11-story hotel, beating by three months the economic downturn that sent the Thai currency to record lows, and eventually he and his wife, Vanee, joined their children in Florida.</p>
        <p>Like others, he worries about burnout and pushing his daughters too hard.</p>
        <p>''From the beginning, I don't wish this,'' In Jong said. ''It's very important that they do this for themselves.''</p>
        <p>Any decision by the Wongluekiets to turn pro early could result in a legal battle. According to L.P.G.A. rules, players who are 16 can petition to waive the 18-year-old membership requirement, although no one has ever tried to do so.</p>
        <p>''We are not in a hurry,'' In Jong said. ''Everything is following naturally with no problems. I don't think they are good enough. They are not very good players yet. They are still young. They still need more experience.''</p>
        <p>The latest player to graduate from high school and turn pro is Dorothy Delasin of Daly City, Calif., who earned her L.P.G.A. Tour card with a fourth-place finish at qualifying school. Christie Kerr in 1997 and Michelle McGann in 1989 also turned pro after graduating from high school.</p>
        <p>''They are too young to think about that now,'' In Jong said. ''If they go to college, they will go together. If they go to college, it will be to study, not just play golf.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Aree and Naree continue to improve at a rapid rate. According to Chan, his sisters' games are as similar as their looks.</p>
        <p>Aree is considered the more aggressive player and longer by 5 yards off the tee. Both possess splendid, fearless short games. ''Naree is more technical,'' Chan said. ''Aree is just grip it and rip it. Otherwise, they are the same. Whoever happens to be playing better that week usually wins.''</p>
        <p>Aree is slightly taller and about two pounds heavier. Naree is older by nine minutes. Both have benefited from having an older brother who plays at a high level.</p>
        <p>''It's like tennis,'' said Gilchrist, who predicts one of the twins will win an L.P.G.A. major championship before they turn 16. ''All the top girls, they don't practice with other girls. They practice with men.''</p>
        <p>Yet In Jong said: ''Success and a strong mind does not come immediately. It takes time. I always remind them of that.''</p>
