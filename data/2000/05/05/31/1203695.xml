        <p>Gov. George W. Bush challenged Vice President Al Gore's fitness to serve as commander in chief of the armed forces today, saying an erosion of the military's might and morale during the Clinton-Gore administration was the reason ''for a new sign on the Pentagon that says 'Under New Management.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush used an appearance here at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post No. 1, the organization's oldest, to recite a laundry list of current problems with the military, restate his commitment to making necessary improvements and question whether voters should have much confidence in Mr. Gore's capacity for leadership on the issue.</p>
        <p>''My opponent -- who's no stranger to exaggeration, I might add --  boasts on his Web site that he has been intimately involved in the best-managed build-down in American military history,'' Mr. Bush said, an unmistakable sprinkling of sarcasm in his voice.</p>
        <p>''But I want the people of Colorado and America to consider the results of seven years of the vice president's management involvement,'' he said. ''Entire Army divisions are not prepared for war. Military recruiting fell thousands short of its goal. And 6,000 United States soldiers are on food stamps.''</p>
        <p>''Al Gore claims that qualifies him for a promotion,'' Mr. Bush continued. But, he said, ''the Clinton-Gore record cries out for a new sign on the Pentagon that says 'Under New Management.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's pointed remarks represented an effort by the Texas governor to turn the tables on Mr. Gore and blunt the questions that Mr. Gore and other administration officials have raised about how well Mr. Bush is prepared to manage the country's military and foreign affairs.</p>
        <p>Political analysts have long considered Mr. Bush's inexperience on the global stage, along with several gaffes that underscored it, to be a significant potential weak spot in his candidacy. Over the last week, both Mr. Gore and Defense Secretary William S. Cohen have expressed particular concern over Mr. Bush's proposal for the research and development of a missile defense system vaster than the one being considered by the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen, a Republican, warned that it could lead to an arms buildup by other countries, and, in an appearance on a Sunday television news program, he even invited Mr. Bush in for a briefing by Defense Department officials. Mr. Bush, making his first public comments on the matter today, implied that he would not be R.S.V.P.-ing anytime soon.</p>
        <p>''I found the comments to be political in nature,'' Mr. Bush said at a news conference here after his speech at the veterans' post. He said  he had been amply informed and advised by his own team of foreign policy and defense experts.</p>
        <p>''I think the briefing I got from Colin Powell and Dick Cheney and Henry Kissinger was substantial,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I've got one of the finest foreign policy teams ever assembled, and I call upon my opponent not to allow members of the administration to politicize matters of defense.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush made no acknowledgment today that some military cutbacks began before the Clinton administration, when Mr. Bush's father was president. Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, said that low military pay was a problem then, too and that there were about 19,400 service people on food stamps in 1991, in President George Bush's administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hattaway noted that the vice president had made his own set of proposals for strengthening the military and increasing spending on defense, particularly for higher pay for enlisted men and women. And Mr. Hattaway questioned whether Mr. Bush was the right person to be raising concerns about military preparedness.</p>
        <p>''Experts say his irresponsible position on missile defense could lead to a new arms race,'' he said. ''With all the complex national defense issues we face, the next commander in chief should not be going through on-the-job training.''</p>
        <p>During a telephone conference call with reporters that was arranged by the Democratic National Committee, former Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown made those criticisms even more personal, questioning the nature of Mr. Bush's military service in the Vietnam War.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did not serve overseas but instead served in Houston in the Texas Air National Guard. Mr. Gore went to Vietnam as an Army journalist.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's complaint with the health of the country's armed forces was not new, but he rendered it in especially strong terms today. Mr. Bush has said he would call for an extra $1 billion a year over what Congress had already agreed to pay in salary increases for men and women serving in the military. That is one of several ways in which he would spend more on national defense, which he says is currently being shortchanged.</p>
        <p>''Defense spending as a percentage of the gross national product is the lowest it has been since prior to Pearl Harbor,'' Mr. Bush said today as he presented a litany of facts and figures to portray a military in alarming decline. ''United States Air Force readiness for combat has fallen to its lowest level in 15 years.''</p>
        <p>''At the same time, we've asked our service men and women to do too much with too little,'' he said, adding that their morale had suffered sharply as a result.</p>
        <p>He said the blame rested with the Clinton administration, which had overextended troops and deployed them in a sometimes haphazard, poorly planned and unnecessarily prolonged fashion.</p>
        <p>''Before we commit troops, there has to be a clear strategy,'' Mr. Bush said, citing Bosnia and Haiti as two examples of places where that was arguably not the case.</p>
