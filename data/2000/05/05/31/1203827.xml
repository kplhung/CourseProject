      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Carl Pickens, the disgruntled Cincinnati wide receiver, is expected to be released by the Bengals tomorrow and his agent said yesterday that Pickens was still interested in joining the Jets.</p>
        <p>''That's the first call I will make,'' Steve Zucker said. ''That's where he wants to go.''</p>
        <p>Although the Jets drafted two wide receivers and have Wayne Chrebet and Dedric Ward returning, none is taller than 5 feet 11 inches. Pickens, at 6-2 and 206 pounds, is closer in size to Keyshawn Johnson (6-3, 212), who was traded before the draft.</p>
        <p>Coach Al Groh has indicated that the Jets may be interested in Andre Hastings, a free-agent wide receiver who was most recently with New Orleans.</p>
        <p>Pickens had a stormy relationship with the Bengals, despite sighing a lucrative contract just before last season. The Jets have been non-commital about Pickens since it became obvious a month ago that the Bengals would cut him, and Bill Parcells, the director of football operations, has cast doubt on Pickens's viability because he is likely to seek about $3 million a year.</p>
        <p>The Jets must still make salary cap room just to sign their three first-round picks.</p>
