        <p>As the story goes, 11 schoolteachers were picnicking in the Catskills in the late 19th century when they discovered a waterfall. They named it Nevele -- eleven spelled backward.

        <p>Now the 800-acre, 682-room resort, which traces its roots to a farm and boardinghouse that opened in the first decade of the 20th century, has new owners and has begun undergoing a $10 million renovation to help it attract corporate guests besides its traditional clientele.</p>

        <p>As the story goes, 11 schoolteachers were picnicking in the Catskills in the late 19th century when they discovered a waterfall. They named it Nevele -- eleven spelled backward. And that is how the Nevele Grande Resort and Country Club in Ellenville, N.Y., on whose property the waterfall still cascades, originally got its name.</p>
        <p>Now the 800-acre, 682-room resort, which traces its roots to a farm and boardinghouse that opened in the first decade of the 20th century, has new owners and has begun undergoing a $10 million renovation to help it attract corporate guests besides its traditional clientele.</p>
        <p>''We consider the Nevele a great opportunity,'' said Joel S. Hoffman, a principal of the Stratford Business Corporation, which bought the hotel in March for $15.8 million. ''Because of its proximity to New York City and the metropolitan area, we think there's a big market for people to come here.</p>
        <p>''There aren't a lot of places to go unless you get on an airplane, and after the renovation we will be marketing the resort strenuously. The Nevele has long been known for its facilities, like its 27-hole golf course and its outdoor ice rink, so we think we have a very viable product.''</p>
        <p>The resort, in Ulster County, was operated for decades as the Nevele and the Fallsview hotels by three generations of the Slutsky family. The two hotels were bought by Fred Kassner in 1997 and combined into the Nevele Grande Resort. Mr. Kassner died in 1998, and the resort was bought from his estate by Stratford, whose other principal is Mitchell Wolff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Wolff are real estate investors and developers who, through Stratford, own and manage more than six million square feet of office and industrial properties nationwide.</p>
        <p>Last year, Mr. Hoffman said, the occupancy rate at the Nevele, which has 600 employees, was 40 percent. ''But it was making money,'' he said. ''With the renovation, we want to create a resort that can appeal to different types of guests. We want to keep our traditional Jewish clientele -- we were sold out at Passover -- and also attract the corporate market.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoffman said he was not concerned about the long decline of the Catskills as a resort area. The downturn began with the advent of inexpensive air fares in the 1970's and competition from Europe and Florida. It led to the closing of many hotels, among them such renowned resorts as the Concord and Grossingers.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the major Catskills resorts were not upgraded and maintained properly,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''The money was not put in.''</p>
        <p>Now the Catskills may be on the verge of an upswing. A developer is planning to demolish the Concord, on Kiamesha Lake in Sullivan County, and build a $500 million resort, with a hotel and conference center, golf village, spa ranch, entertainment center and wilderness area. And a plan to open a gambling casino in the area -- which has run into legal problems in recent weeks -- would bring a needed boost.</p>
        <p>''We bought the hotel with no assumption that gambling would ever happen,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''But if it happens, it should be great, and should attract a lot of visitors to the area.'' He said that he had begun to look into the possibility of gambling on the Nevele property but that ''it was a long way off.''</p>
        <p>The renovation, during which the hotel will remain open, involves upgrading and expanding the Nevele's meeting rooms and conference center as well as refurbishing all 682 rooms in the six main buildings and enhancing the lobbies, corridors, elevators and recreational facilities, including the health club and the indoor racquetball and tennis courts. The makeover, most of which is scheduled for completion by next March, was designed by the architectural firm of Adache Associates in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.</p>
        <p>Stratford, with headquarters in Hempstead, N.Y., and Parsippany, N.J., owns and manages the 2.2-million-square-foot Horseheads Industrial Center near Elmira, N.Y., the million-square-foot First National Center office building in Oklahoma City and the 175,000-square-foot 90 State Street in Albany. It also has properties on Long Island and in Dayton, Ohio, and Piscataway, N.J.</p>
        <p>Over the years, the Nevele, part of the borscht belt, has attracted many popular entertainers. They included Red Buttons, Jackie Mason, Julius LaRosa, Alan King, Shecky Green,  Tony Martin, the Coasters, the Platters and Little Anthony and the Imperials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoffman said he planned to continue that tradition. ''After the renovation is completed, we want to bring in well-known, high-visibility performers,'' he said. ''And we will try to get them in the wintertime, to attract guests at the slowest time of the year.''</p>
