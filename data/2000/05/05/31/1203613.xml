        <p>Keep in mind that a horse has a little brain. You and I, as the intelligent ones, we have to come down to this horse's level. We have to try to get into this animal's head.</p>
        <p>When giving beginner lessons, if I sense there's some fear in you, we're going to stop and have a five-minute chat:</p>
        <p>''What do you fear?''</p>
        <p>''Well, I fear getting thrown.''</p>
        <p>''Well, some horses will never throw you, and if you're a beginner, that's probably the kind of horse you'll be on.''</p>
        <p>''I fear getting kicked.''</p>
        <p>''Well, you can't get kicked being on top of the horse. It is physically impossible.''</p>
        <p>With proper instruction, anyone can ride with confidence, knowing what to do in case a horse is going and he moves laterally, which can pop you out of the saddle. I mean actually getting into this animal, actually riding this horse, toe always up, heel always down, a nice seat you work from the waist-down to ride.</p>
        <p>I learned to ride in Central Park. I used to go down on the weekend, and I'd clean the stables and brush the horses and what-not. And my mother, she used to tear into me. She would say, ''Where'd you get this money?'' and I'd say, ''Ma, I worked for it.'' And she'd say, ''What's that smell?'' I'd come home smelling of stables.</p>
        <p>How I got started riding, I was shining shoes down there. And I saw this guy wearing beautiful paddock boots, English boots, and I said, ''Mister, can I give you a shine?'' and he said, ''Son, all you going to do is mess up these new boots.'' Then I said, ''What you do?'' He said, ''I ride, I train horses.'' I said, ''Maybe you'll take me out to ride on a horse?'' He said, ''O.K., how about tomorrow?'' I said, ''I can't go tomorrow, tomorrow's school.''</p>
        <p>A kid who stays out of school today, it's different. Back then, a kid stayed out of school, the truant officer came to the house. But that one time I played hooky, I went riding with this guy, and he says, ''Kid, you're a natural.'' That was the beginning.</p>
        <p>The rich at that time were different than the rich of today. They were not as snobbish as today, they could recognize, ''That's young Sam, he rides here, and he's a good kid.'' That wouldn't happen today to a kid like me who just wanted to ride in Central Park. The rich today, they're too much into protecting their turf.</p>
        <p>I love horses. I understand them. I don't sentimentalize them. I don't kiss a horse. Every now and then I'll give them a little pat. A horse has no emotions, no nothing, he's just a beast of burden with a little brain the size of a walnut. I don't want to get attached to that animal because I get attached I'll never sell him. But I do keep a scrapbook with pictures of most of the horses I have owned in it.</p>
