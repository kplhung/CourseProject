        <p>The three players the Devils have been counting on to carry them to the Stanley Cup responded in grand fashion tonight in Game 1 against the Dallas Stars.</p>
        <p>The combination of Jason Arnott centering for Patrik Elias on the left and Petr Sykora on the right, which has been the team's premier line all season, produced 11 points in a 7-3 triumph over the Dallas Stars at Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>Arnott and Sykora each had two goals and two assists, while Elias had three brilliant assists, two on Sykora's goals and one on Arnott's first that opened the scoring.</p>
        <p>''They had an unbelievable game,'' Bobby Holik said. ''They did great for us. They've played well together all season.''</p>
        <p>While their teammates were ecstatic, Coach Larry Robinson was not as generous in his praise. ''I don't know if they were dominant,'' he said. ''They moved the puck around pretty well, they were skating as good as we have seen them and when they are skating and moving the puck and getting chances like that they can play well.''</p>
        <p>Despite their success, the three were rather calm.</p>
        <p>''We've worked together for a long time and we know each other,'' Sykora said. ''We don't want to be cocky. We want to be sure we're ready for the next game.''</p>
        <p>Their heroics knocked Ed Belfour out of the game for the first time in these playoffs. The man who backstopped the Stars to their Stanley Cup triumph last June had an average game tonight, allowing 6 goals on 18 shots.</p>
        <p>Along with the huge contribution from their top line, the Devils got goals from Ken Daneyko, Scott Stevens and Sergei Brylin.</p>
        <p>Arnott scored the crucial first goal 7 minutes 22 seconds into the game, when he stepped in the slot and redirected Sykora's pass from the left side for his fifth in the playoffs. The play was started by Elias, who went around Belfour's goal from right to left and tried to jam the puck at Belfour's right doorstep.</p>
        <p>''That first goal was ever so important,'' Devils defenseman Scott Niedermayer said.</p>
        <p>''We didn't expect what happened after that, but it was nice to see it happen,'' Niedermayer added, referring to the six additional goals.</p>
        <p>Sykora scored the third goal for the Devils after a brilliant move by Elias, again with crafty work behind the goal. Just when everyone, including Belfour, thought he was going from left to right behind the goal, Elias back-passed to Sykora at Belfour's doorstep for Sykora's seventh.</p>
        <p>''Patty made a good pass on that goal,'' Sykora said. ''I think he knew I was going to be there.''</p>
        <p>Sykora scored his second of the night, 3:02 into the last period, when he got a pass from Arnott and beat Belfour. Sykora's goal gave the Devils a 6-1 lead and meant the end of the night for Belfour. He was pulled immediately after the goal in favor of his backup, Manny Fernandez, who made his first appearance in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Arnott greeted Fernandez with his second of the night and sixth of the season just over two minutes after his entrance when he redirected Holik's centering pass from the left side during a power play for the Devils.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people keep pinpointing our line,'' Arnott said, ''but it's with contributions from everybody that we're here. All we want is to just keep working and keep having fun.''</p>
