        <p>As CBS kicks off its island survival test, ''Survivor,'' at 8 tonight -- a show that CBS clearly hopes will become this summer's phenomenon, as ''Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' was for ABC last summer -- ABC has decided to make that goal as elusive as possible.</p>

        <p>'Millionaire' Vs. 'Survivor'</p>
        <p>ABC is making one thing clear tonight: It may be in the business of making millionaires, but not at CBS.</p>
        <p>As CBS kicks off its island survival test, ''Survivor,'' at 8 tonight -- a show that CBS clearly hopes will become this summer's phenomenon, as ''Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' was for ABC last summer -- ABC has decided to make that goal as elusive as possible.</p>
        <p>At the last minute, past the date by which it could even be included in program listings, ABC threw in yet another edition of ''Millionaire'' tonight to go head to head with the opening night of ''Survivor's'' 13-week run.</p>
        <p>The news got out last week, about the time TV Guide was arriving with ''Survivor'' on its cover.</p>
        <p>The next sound heard was a howl of anger at CBS headquarters. Several executives there who did not want their remarks attributed accused their ABC counterparts of playing dirty pool scheduling-wise to undercut CBS's hopes without having anything to gain for themselves.</p>
        <p>One CBS executive who did speak for attribution was Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television, who acknowledged that he was far from happy with the decision.</p>
        <p>''I think it's bad for the network television business,'' Mr. Moonves said. ''You would think that ABC could accept their victories and not have to go out and try to stop someone else from having a victory.''</p>
        <p>This position left Stu Bloomberg and Lloyd Braun, the twin chairmen of ABC Entertainment, a but nonplussed.</p>
        <p>''Why not do it?'' Mr. Bloomberg asked. ''It's a competition. We obviously don't want them to get on the air and get traction with their show. I have absolutely no regrets about doing it.''</p>
        <p>This is ABC's position, even though putting another edition of ''Millionaire'' on this week, after the official television season has ended, does not provide any ratings benefits for ABC.</p>
        <p>And the decision does fly a bit in the face of the sentiment expressed by some ABC executives that ''Millionaire'' is a precious program resource that should not be overused. Even Mr. Bloomberg conceded, ''I'd like to rest the show a bit if I can.''</p>
        <p>But the chance to stop ''Survivor'' before it can get going apparently was too strong a lure to be passed up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moonves noted that the decision seemed last-minute, as if ABC suddenly got worried about the attention ''Survivor'' was receiving. ''It clearly came after the TV Guide cover and all the other press we've been getting,'' Mr. Moonves said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Braun said, ''This is not something we thought about yesterday.''</p>
        <p>A member of the ''Millionaire'' production staff said that the extra, anti-''Survivor'' edition of ''Millionaire'' had been in the works for weeks. Which led to the speculation that ABC fully intended a kind of stealth effort against ''Survivor'' at a time when CBS could not alter its starting date.</p>
        <p>Mr. Braun said, ''We're totally trying to be smart in how we use 'Millionaire.' I don't believe by scheduling our programs against theirs we're in any way compromising the television business. Our job is to get people to watch our network, not the other networks.''</p>
        <p>The test of interest in ''Survivor'' may be skewed tonight, but CBS executives said they always felt its real test would unfold over the full length of its run, measured by how much word of mouth the series can build up.</p>
        <p>Each week one of the contestants gets voted off the island by the others, in a game of attrition leading to a climax in which the last survivor takes home $1 million.</p>
        <p>CBS's hopes for a similar series, ''Big Brother,'' which will play out over 90 straight nights later this summer, may hinge on how well ''Survivor'' builds that audience.</p>
        <p>But ABC may try to play a hand there as well. ''We've haven't decided yet what we'll be doing with 'Millionaire' the following week,'' Mr. Braun said.</p>
        <p>Richter's Late Farewell</p>
        <p>With a week of shows celebrating his status as sidekick, Andy Richter got a great sendoff from ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' in every way,  except from the NBC schedulers. Mr. Richter's final night, Friday, coincided with coverage of one of NBC's N.B.A. playoff games.</p>
        <p>The game ran so late that it delayed the start of ''The Tonight Show'' almost until the usual 12:35 start of Mr O'Brien's show. That meant ''Late Night'' couldn't start until almost 1:30 a.m.</p>
        <p>So the ratings for Mr. Richter's finale (he quit the show to pursue an acting career) were nothing to post in his book of memories. That show averaged only a 2.7 in the biggest cities, not even as high as the previous Friday when the show scored a 2.8. (Each rating point represents just over a million homes.)</p>
        <p>Brokaw to Quiz Putin</p>
        <p>Tom Brokaw will interview the new Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on ''The NBC Nightly News'' tomorrow night, the first in-depth interview Mr. Putin has granted to American television since he took office on May 7.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brokaw said yesterday that he and his staff had been working on securing an interview with Mr. Putin for several months but that the Russian leader had proved elusive. With the summit meeting with President Clinton scheduled this weekend, the timing apparently was right.</p>
        <p>''I think there are four big areas we'll concentrate on,'' Mr. Brokaw said. ''First, who is this guy? Then of course, the relationship with the United States and the question of the nuclear arsenals, crime and corruption, and how on earth do you revive that economy.''</p>
        <p>The interview is likely to take place around midday in Moscow, and Mr. Brokaw said he expected to use a sizable portion of it during tomorrow night's broadcast. More of the interview will be seen on the ''Today'' program on Friday morning and on ''Meet The Press'' on Sunday morning.</p>
        <p>''I'm looking forward to the chance to really sit down with him,'' Mr. Brokaw said, noting that he was the first American television journalist to interview Mikhail S. Gorbachev after he assumed power. ''I think for the most part Putin is still an enigma.''</p>
        <p>On another NBC outlet, MSNBC, George W. Bush will sit down for an interview with Chris Matthews on his ''Hardball'' program tomorrow night at 7. This interview will be conducted live, from a restaurant named El Pinto in Albuquerque.</p>
        <p>Mr. Matthews said he planned to emphasize education, Social Security, missile defense, possible running mates and Mr. Bush's campaign strategy against Al Gore.</p>
