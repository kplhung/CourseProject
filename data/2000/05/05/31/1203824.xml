        <p>NIKE U.S. CUP</p>
        <p>GREG BERHALTER faced a dilemma.</p>
        <p>If his Dutch club, Cambuur, lost a playoff game yesterday and was relegated from the Honor Division, he would get a free transfer to another club, either in the Netherlands or elsewhere, and an immediate ticket home to the United States for the start of the Nike U.S. Cup on Saturday against South Africa in Washington.</p>
        <p>If Cambuur won yesterday's match, Berhalter, a native of Tenafly, N.J., who is trying to secure a regular starting spot on the national team as a defender, would have to delay his return home and would not have been available until the June 6 match against Ireland in Foxboro, Mass.</p>
        <p>''I would like to be with the national team, it does mean a lot to me,'' Berhalter, 26, said Sunday in a telephone interview from his home in Leeuwarden, a city in the northern Netherlands. ''The game against Mexico would be my first at Giants Stadium. It's kind of my hometown area.'' The game against Mexico is on June 11 as part of a doubleheader that includes Ireland versus South africa.</p>
        <p>Cambuur did indeed lose yesterday in the Dutch playoffs and will be relegated. Berhalter will join the American team in Washington today for this weekend's game.</p>
        <p>Since leaving the University of North Carolina after his junior year, Berhalter has played professionally in the Netherlands for the past six seasons, the past two with Cambuur.</p>
        <p>''It's been such a great experience for me over here,'' he said. ''My wife and I have been all around Europe and we've been exposed to so much culturally.''</p>
        <p>Although he has been on the United States national team roster for about 50 games, Berhalter has seen action as a central defender in only 10. He played in the 2-0 defeat in Russia in April. As a young American veteran in Europe, Berhalter has a high regard for the Dutch style of play.</p>
        <p>''As a defender over here I've learned the importance of keeping the ball,'' Berhalter said. ''I want to start the attack. The thing about Dutch players is that every one of them can play, regardless of position.''</p>
        <p>MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER</p>
        <p>Three Americans are among the top four scorers in the league. Chicago's ANTE RAZOV leads M.L.S. with 11 goals and 3 assists for 25 points. JASON KREIS of Dallas is second with 23 points (8 goals, 7 assists) and DANTE WASHINGTON of Columbus is fourth with 19 points (9 goals, 1 assist).</p>
        <p>Razov and Kreis are on the United States roster for the U.S. Cup and could give a boost to the American offense. The other strikers for Coach BRUCE ARENA are BRIAN McBRIDE of Columbus and COBI JONES of Los Angeles. McBride has 4 goals in his last 16 international matches and Jones has scored only 3 goals for the national team since 1998.</p>
        <p>Kansas City's TONY MEOLA saw his league-record shutout streak end after 681 minutes when MAMA-DUO DIALLO scored for Tampa Bay, 2-1. The Wizards (10-0-2) remain the league's only undefeated team and have allowed a league-best five goals.</p>

        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>

        <p>LOTHAR MATTHAUS, who left the MetroStars for Germany last week to play in his farewell game, tore a muscle in his right thigh during training over the weekend and will miss two warm-up matches (tomorrow against Liechtenstein and Saturday against the Czech Republic) in advance of next month's European Championships in the Ntherlands and Belgium. Matthaus had said he would be ready for the Liechtenstein match, but the team's medical officials ruled that out yesterday. Germany, the defending champion, opens the tournament against Romania on June 12. ...

Brazil, the Czech Republic and France are the top three nations in the world. ...
