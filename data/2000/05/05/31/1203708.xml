        <p>From the balcony of St. Michael's Church in Flushing, Queens, the choir's hymn of resurrection rained down on the mourners as they filed out of the church, shuffling behind a polished wooden coffin bearing the body of Ramon Nazario, one of five workers killed Wednesday in a massacre at a nearby Wendy's restaurant.</p>
        <p>Moments earlier, the Rev. Michael Melendez had read a poem written in memory of Mr. Nazario by his young niece, Alexandra. ''I hear your laughter as a tear slowly runs down my cheek,'' the priest said. ''Oh! How I wish this was all a big mistake.''</p>

        <p>From the balcony of St. Michael's Church in Flushing, Queens, the choir's hymn of resurrection rained down on the mourners as they filed out of the church, shuffling behind a polished wooden coffin bearing the body of Ramon Nazario, one of five workers killed Wednesday in a massacre at a nearby Wendy's restaurant.</p>
        <p>Moments earlier, the Rev. Michael Melendez had read a poem written in memory of Mr. Nazario by his young niece, Alexandra. ''I hear your laughter as a tear slowly runs down my cheek,'' the priest said. ''Oh! How I wish this was all a big mistake.''</p>
        <p>The dead man's niece and 200 other family members and friends, many of them gray with grief, went  to St. Michael's yesterday to pay last respects at the funeral Mass.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nazario was a native of Puerto Rico, and Father Melendez conducted most of the Mass in Spanish and called for the intercession of Our Lady of Divine Providence, the patron saint of Puerto Rico. The Wendy's worker had been a member of the Roman Catholic parish, and Father Melendez's grief was apparent as he rubbed tears from his eyes as he prepared the Eucharist.</p>
        <p>''It is very difficult for anyone to bury a loved one,'' Father Melendez said during an English segment of his homily. ''It's more difficult to say goodbye to someone who dies in such a violent manner.''</p>
        <p>Two men, John B. Taylor and Craig Godineaux, have been charged with the killings at Wendy's. Police investigators said Mr. Taylor and Mr. Godineaux lured the manager and six workers to the basement of the restaurant, bound them and shot them in the head, killing five. Mr. Taylor appeared in State Supreme Court in Manhattan yesterday for an unrelated probation violation hearing, but said nothing.</p>
        <p>Since the shooting, Mr. Nazario's family has been among the most visible of the victims' relatives. His brother, Benjamin, has demanded the death penalty for Mr. Godineaux and Mr. Taylor. After Mr. Nazario's wake last Saturday, newspapers and television programs showed pictures of grieving family members.</p>
        <p>In his remarks, Father Melendez lamented that Mr. Nazario's family had not been allowed to grieve in private. ''What makes it worse is to be badgered and bullied by the news media and not being allowed to mourn properly,'' he said.</p>
        <p>During the Mass's peace offering, Father Melendez held Benjamin Nazario's hand and complimented him for his composure in front of the television cameras. The cameras kept their distance yesterday, lining the sidewalk across the street. They were not allowed inside the church.</p>
        <p>It was the second funeral for a  Wendy's victim. A funeral Mass was said over the weekend for Jean Dumel Auguste. A service for Jeremy Mele will be today in Adelphi, N.J. The family of Anita C. Smith is planning a funeral for her on Saturday in Hewlett, N.Y., on Long Island.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the Rev. Al Sharpton visited the home of Mrs. Smith's grandparents, Roy and Pamella Truman. Mr. Sharpton said it was important to let the family know they were not alone, and he criticized city leaders for not visiting the family.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the mayor declined to respond to Mr. Sharpton's remarks. The mayor's office, working with Wendy's executives, has set up a victim assistance fund to help  with funeral arrangements.</p>
        <p>The body of one victim, Ibadat Ali,  remains unclaimed in the city morgue. Little has been known about Mr. Ali, but Mohammed Chaudhary, the director of the Edhi International Foundation in Corona, Queens, said a representative of his organization had finally spoken yesterday with Mr. Ali's father, Daulat Ali, and brothers, Karim and Raiz Ali.</p>
        <p>The foundation representative visited the men in Narowal, a village in northeastern Pakistan, and told them of Mr. Ali's murder. Mr. Chaudhary said he hoped his representative would talk today to Mr. Ali's wife, who lives in another village, and make arrangements to return his body to Pakistan.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the most seriously injured of the robbery's two survivors, Jaquione Johnson, made more progress. Mr. Johnson had undergone surgery Friday for a bullet in the head. On Monday, he was removed from a respirator and has been drinking water and eating ice, said Gladys Jones, Mr. Johnson's grandmother. He seems unable to move his right arm, family members said, but doctors think he has some feeling on that side of his body.</p>
        <p>''He is not saying words, but he is trying to say something,'' said Regina Jones, Mr. Johnson's aunt. ''He makes little sounds, but you can tell it hurts him, because after he does that he touches his throat.''</p>
        <p>News of Mr. Johnson's recovery had reached Mr. Nazario's funeral, where customers and co-workers from Wendy's lingered on the steps of St. Michael's afterward. Many said they were struggling to make sense of the crime.</p>
        <p>''I left the Wendy's at 5 on the day it happened,'' Jeannie DiDonato said. ''I knew every one of them. We would stop in for coffee three or four times a week.''</p>
        <p>Ms. DiDonato said she believed that Mr. Nazario was frustrated working as a porter in the restaurant and longed for something better. ''He always looked so sad,'' she said. ''You could see how unhappy he was with a menial job.''</p>
        <p>But Mario Gonzalez, a former worker at the Wendy's, said Mr. Nazario did his job well. Mr. Gonzalez, who quit his job at Wendy's two months ago, said his friend would put aside his own work to help him if he looked overwhelmed.</p>
        <p>''He would help me all the time,'' Mr. Gonzalez said. ''I have lost all my friends. It is very painful.''</p>
