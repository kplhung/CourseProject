        <p>The Stanley Cup finals began tonight in Continental Arena with a three-hour party for the Devils and their giddy fans. Breaking open a 1-1 tie early in the second period, the Devils surged to a stunning 7-3 victory over the Dallas Stars, the defending champions.</p>
        <p>Jason Arnott scored twice and so did Petr Sykora. They got a goal from Ken Daneyko, a veteran defenseman who has not scored in the postseason since 1995 and had not scored in the regular season. They got one from Scott Stevens, another veteran defenseman who is better known for his heavy hits. And they got one from Sergei Brylin.</p>
        <p>They scored 6 times on 18 shots against Ed Belfour, the Dallas goalie who was replaced by Manny Fernandez in the third period. By scoring six consecutive goals, the Devils set a team playoff record.</p>
        <p>''It never rains,'' said Larry Robinson, the Devils' coach. ''It pours.''</p>
        <p>It also sprinkled a little on the Devils and their goalie, Martin Brodeur. They got so loose with their six-goal lead that they allowed the Stars to score two goals in a 12-second span in the eighth minute of the third period to cut the margin to 7-3.</p>
        <p>Game 2 of this four-of-seven-game series will be played here on Thursday night.</p>
        <p>''We've always bounced back,'' Dallas Coach Ken Hitchcock said. ''It puts a little pressure on us. We know we're going to play a better game.'' The Stars eliminated Colorado on Saturday night, a day after the Devils eliminated Philadelphia, also in seven games. With one less day to rest and more long-distance travel, might Dallas have been tired?</p>
        <p>''Some of our best players were a step late,'' Hitchcock said. One of them was Sergei Zubov, the Dallas defenseman who was a minus-four. And Belfour was beaten on goals he might have stopped on other nights.</p>
        <p>''Eddie did not have a great night,'' Hitchcock said. ''I know he'll bounce back.'' Belfour blamed a cold and decongestants he was taking to treat it. They caused him to make bad decisions, he said.</p>
        <p>Brodeur stopped 15 of 18 shots, two of them in succession early in the second period when the Devils held a 2-1 lead.</p>
        <p>The first was on Mike Modano, on a slap shot. The second was on Brett Hull, on the rebound. They are Dallas's two best shooters. The Devils turned around and quickly scored two goals to pull away. This was the pivotal point of the game.</p>
        <p>''For sure,'' Brodeur said, when asked if he thought the moment significant. ''It happened real quick.'' Modano, he said, ''just walked into a big slapper'' after a breakdown in coverage. As for Hull, Brodeur did not even know who was shooting because he kept his eye on the puck. ''I was lucky to get a glove on'' it, Brodeur said.</p>
        <p>Each team had one injury and both coaches said they were insignificant, although both players left the game. Derian Hatcher, Dallas's hard-hitting defenseman and captain, had a hyperextended right knee in a collision with Alexander Mogilny after rough treatment of several Devils. Earlier, Hatcher cross-checked Patrik Elias, elbowed John Madden and slashed Sykora. Only the slash was penalized.</p>
        <p>''Right now, it's minor,'' Hitchcock said of Hatcher's injury. ''He should be a player in Game 2.''</p>
        <p>Madden, who recovered from an elbow to the head, left after what Robinson called a ''little twinge'' to a left knee that was more seriously injured in the previous round. ''He's fine,'' Robinson said of Madden, a rookie who kills penalties and centers a checking line.</p>
        <p>Arnott finished with two goals and two assists. Sykora had two goals and two assists. Elias had three assists. Of all the goals, the prettiest was Sykora's first. He was set up by Elias, who dropped Belfour to the ice with a right-to-left move across the crease, cut past the goal line and flipped a backhanded pass onto Sykora's stick.</p>
        <p>The line was New Jersey's most effective in the previous series, scoring eight goals in seven games. Hitchcock said his team had difficulty coping with the Devils' quickness, particularly from this line. Arnott, the center, was often matched against Modano, the key center of the Stars. He did not seem to mind.</p>
        <p>''Well, this is exciting,'' Arnott said. ''I mean, just all the hype and just being round the locker room and out seeing the fans so excited, it was definitely nice to have an exciting game like that. But we've got to calm down and keep it on an even level. We know that these guys are going to come back hard.''</p>
        <p>But the goal that was most fun was Daneyko's, which put them ahead to stay. The veteran, who has played in every playoff game in franchise history, fired after Madden won a face-off, set a screen and jumped from the path of the oncoming shot. This delighted his teammates. Even the veterans have rarely seen Daneyko score.</p>
        <p>Stevens said he watched from the bench, hoping no one had touched the puck on the way in. Bobby Holik joked: ''We didn't hold our breath waiting for him to score. If we did, we'd be blue in the face. I think he was just saving himself for the right time and no time is better than the present.''</p>
        <p>Scott Niedermayer, Daneyko's defense partner, said: ''We'll definitely here about it for a while. He loves to talk about it.'' Daneyko, speaking of the game and not the goal said that if the Devils are not prepared for Game 2: ''We're going to be tied, 1-1.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>Back in the lineup for the Devils was SERGEI NEMCHINOV, a versatile veteran forward who missed Game 7 of the previous series against Philadelphia after sustaining a 40-stitch cut on his face in Game 6. Nemchinov played left wing next to center SCOTT GOMEZ and right wing ALEXANDER MOGILNY. . . . The most goals scored by a team in a Stanley Cup championship round game is 9. The Detroit Red Wings did it during a 9-4 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs in Game 2 of the 1936 finals, and the Leafs did it to the Wings in 1942 in a 9-3 Game 5 victory. . . . The 10 goals over all for the game was the most in a National Hockey League finals since 1992, when Pittsburgh and Chicago combined for 11 in a Game 4 6-5 shootout that clinched the cup for the Penguins.</p>
