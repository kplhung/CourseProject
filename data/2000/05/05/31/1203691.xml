        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>GREEN PASTURES  Some are lush and others are arid, but all of the stops on Gov. George W. Bush's four-day trek through the West will prove fertile -- with money. Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, reaped an estimated $100,000 for his campaign at a luncheon in Denver on Tuesday and was expected to raise $300,000 for the Republican National Committee and $125,000 for the State Republican Party in New Mexico at a reception in Albuquerque on Tuesday night. By week's end, after visits to Arizona and Nevada as well, Mr. Bush should collect $350,000 for his campaign, $200,000 for state Republican organizations and about $2 million for the national committee, campaign officials said. They said Mr. Bush would raise $1.3 million in regulated ''hard money'' for the committee and at least several hundred thousand dollars in largely unregulated ''soft money.''</p>

        <p>AD ADVISORY  Gov. George W. Bush is turning to an executive of one of the nation's best-known advertising agency, Young &amp; Rubicam, for creative suggestions on television commercials. Jim Ferguson, the advertising agency's chief creative officer, has accepted an unpaid, advisory role in the campaign, said Stuart Stevens, a Republican consultant and a member of Maverick Media, the advertising arm of the Bush campaign. ''We have tremendous respect for what these guys do, and there are skills they have that are almost uniquely suited to a presidential campaign,'' Mr. Stevens said. Mr. Ferguson will assemble an informal group of people in New York who may be asked to help write Mr. Bush's television commercials, Mr. Stevens said. Mr. Ferguson, through an assistant, declined to comment.</p>

        <p>PRAISE FROM McCAIN  Gov. George W. Bush's recent statements on arms-control policy, missile defense and trade with China have drawn hearty praise from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. In an op-ed article in Tuesday's Wall Street Journal, Mr. McCain applauded Mr. Bush for embracing internationalist positions that benefit America's interests. Now if only more Republicans in Congress would follow Mr. Bush's lead, Mr. McCain lamented, citing the Senate's vote to reject setting a deadline to withdraw  ground troops from Kosovo. Only 15 Senate Republicans, including Mr. McCain, backed the measure.</p>

        <p>THE SENATE</p>
        <p>GORTON TAKES TO THE ROAD  Senator Slade Gorton of Washington formally began his re-election campaign with a five-day bus tour of the state. Mr. Gorton, 72, a Republican, vowed to make the rising cost of prescription drugs a centerpiece of his campaign. He has introduced a bill that would bar drug manufacturers from charging Americans more for prescriptions than they charge patients in other countries. Democrats say the issue is a smoke screen for Mr. Gorton's failure to take on corporate interests. A September primary will determine Mr. Gorton's Democratic opponent. That race pits the state insurance commissioner, Deborah Senn, against former Representative Maria Cantwell, an Internet executive.</p>
