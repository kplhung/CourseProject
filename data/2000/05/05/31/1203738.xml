        <p>Jon S. Corzine acknowledged today that he had paid at least $200,000 for a lawyer who had private investigators conduct an inquiry into Jim Florio, his opponent in the Democratic primary for Senate, and members of Mr. Florio's campaign staff.</p>
        <p>After an article today in The Philadelphia Inquirer reported on the inquiry, Mr. Corzine, former chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, said he ordered his lawyer in February to investigate incidents in which his wife and children had received prank telephone calls earlier in the year and saw photographers trying to take pictures through the windows of the family home in Summit, N.J.</p>

        <p>Jon S. Corzine acknowledged today that he had paid at least $200,000 for a lawyer who had private investigators conduct an inquiry into Jim Florio, his opponent in the Democratic primary for Senate, and members of Mr. Florio's campaign staff.</p>
        <p>After an article today in The Philadelphia Inquirer reported on the inquiry, Mr. Corzine, former chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, said he ordered his lawyer in February to investigate incidents in which his wife and children had received prank telephone calls earlier in the year and saw photographers trying to take pictures through the windows of the family home in Summit, N.J.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine said that when he discovered about a month ago that his lawyer, Stanley Arkin, had hired a private investigating company to check out members of Mr. Florio's staff, he ordered the inquiry to stop.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Florio, angered by what he called an invasion of privacy, said today that the questions being posed by the investigators were clearly intended to dig up salacious details about his personal life in an effort to smear his reputation. Mr. Florio said he had received complaints from several staff members and former employees who had been asked for personal ''dirt'' about him and his associates.</p>
        <p>At a news conference, Mr. Florio demanded an apology from Mr. Corzine and said his opponent's Wall Street values and his free-spending campaign, which has already laid out more than $30 million for the primary, were bringing a new level of incivility to New Jersey's rough-and-tumble politics.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Corzine will pay anything, say anything, and now we find out, do anything, regardless of what is acceptable to get elected,'' Mr. Florio said. ''The voters should tell Mr. Corzine to take this campaign to Russia, where he'd fit right in.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's admission that he used private investigators has prompted the latest flare-up in an increasingly bitter battle for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate. Mr. Corzine has shattered all records for spending in a primary, and much of that money has paid for a series of advertisements attacking Mr. Florio's record as governor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio's campaign has also been true to his reputation for combativeness, and in a series of news conferences, faxes and television ads, Mr. Florio has accused Mr. Corzine of everything from raiding employees' pension funds to taking part in a pipeline deal that benefits the ruling party in Sudan.</p>
        <p>Although it is a common, and accepted, practice for political candidates to assign staff members to research their rivals, the use of private investigators is controversial because such investigators are not directly supervised by campaign staff members and often pride themselves on using intimidation or deception to gain information.</p>
        <p>A growing number of political candidates and their surrogates have turned to private investigators in recent years, from President Clinton and Senator Edward M. Kennedy to scores of local officials. But many government watchdog groups say it is a practice best avoided, because private investigators are often difficult to control and the public regards many of them as unscrupulous.</p>
        <p>''It gets close to the old dirty-trick situation from Watergate,'' said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity. ''You get a group of people skulking around in the process. You don't know who they are, what they're getting paid or what they'll do to get information.</p>
        <p>''The public perceives it as over the line, an invasion of privacy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio said he first heard complaints several months ago, when a former employee called from Washington to report that a private investigator had asked for ''anything negative about Jim Florio.'' Since then, George E. Norcross 3rd, a South Jersey political leader and important ally of Mr. Florio, said he was told by several state Democratic Party officials that the Corzine campaign had hired private detectives to follow him. George Zoffinger, Mr. Florio's campaign treasurer, said he too had been warned by friends in the Corzine campaign that he was being investigated.</p>
        <p>''I have friends who work for Corzine who told me to watch out because I'm on the enemies list and they were going to send the private eyes after me,'' said Mr. Zoffinger, the commerce commissioner during Mr. Florio's term as governor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio said he did not publicly complain about the investigations earlier because he wanted to find documented evidence that the Corzine campaign had hired a private security company. When the Corzine campaign released its spending report with the Federal Election Commission last week, it showed $200,000 in payments to Stanley S. Arkin, a prominent New York lawyer, and Mr. Corzine's aides have since confirmed that part of the money paid for private detectives. Mr. Florio said the use of private detectives was ''despicable'' and ''disgraceful.''</p>
        <p>''I have to say this to Mr. Corzine: with your Wall Street ethics of anything goes, you have no business running for one of the highest elective offices in our nation,'' Mr. Florio said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arkin did not return phone calls today requesting comment. James Mintz, owner of the private security concern contracted by the Corzine campaign, also did not return calls.</p>
        <p>But Corzine aides denied that the investigators had ever put anyone under surveillance, insisting that their inquiry was aimed solely at determining whether Mr. Florio's supporters had been harassing the Corzine family.</p>
        <p>No evidence was ever found, said Steven Goldstein, Mr. Corzine's campaign co-manager. Mr. Corzine's aides said it was disingenuous for Mr. Florio to complain about aggressive campaigning, however, and circulated a newspaper article from 1993, when Florio campaign workers were caught sneaking onto Christine Todd Whitman's private property to film video footage of her house.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine refused today to apologize to Mr. Florio, saying he never authorized the use of private investigators. ''I'm not going to apologize because I wasn't looking into anyone's personal life,'' Mr. Corzine said. ''Someone overreached and I pulled him back.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Florio said it was difficult to believe that Mr. Corzine, or any candidate, would pay $200,000 to a lawyer without knowing what the money was for. Mr. Lewis of the Center for Public Integrity, agreed.</p>
        <p>''I suppose when you drop $30 million in a couple months, you can't be certain about where every nickel is going,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''But it strains credulity to think that he didn't know his lawyers would turn to private investigators. That's how the process works.''</p>
