        <p>For weeks there had been quiet talk in the neighborhood about the tall, polite 13-year-old girl. It had not gone unnoticed that she had recently, and rapidly, gained weight. Rumors began to spread that she must be pregnant.</p>
        <p>On Friday afternoon, when she stopped in the Staten Island Deli Express for her usual bagel and cream cheese, the gregarious clerk, Elias Guzman, could not help blurting out, ''What happened to you?'' Blushing with embarrassment, she avoided answering and left quickly.</p>
        <p>Early Monday night, she was taken to the hospital with heavy vaginal bleeding, and hours later, the authorities said, her father made a horrifying discovery in the bathroom of the family's apartment on Clove Road in Staten Island. There, in a bucket, he found a full-term baby boy wrapped in clothing and then placed inside a bag, law enforcement officials said.</p>
        <p>The baby was not breathing, and he was pronounced dead on arrival at Staten Island University Hospital. The New York City medical examiner's office has ruled the baby's death a homicide, and Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the office, said the baby died from blunt impact injuries of the head and from being smothered in the clothing and the bag.</p>
        <p>Late last night, the girl was charged with second-degree manslaughter.</p>
        <p>Earlier, detectives arrested a man they identified as John Frakes, a 19-year-old who lived with his girlfriend in the apartment below the girl's family. Mr. Frakes was charged with statutory rape. Under New York law,  it is a crime for anyone over 18 to have sexual intercourse, consensual or not, with anyone under 14, unless they are married.</p>
        <p>According to neighbors, Mr. Frakes's girlfriend sometimes baby-sat for the 13-year-old girl and her three siblings. Mr. Frakes remained in custody last night pending an arraignment.</p>
        <p>After being charged with manslaughter, the girl was released to the custody of her parents, said Detective John Giammarino, a police spokesman. She will be prosecuted as a juvenile in Family Court by the city corporation counsel's office, said Marlene Markoe-Boyd, a spokeswoman for the Staten Island district attorney, William L. Murphy. .</p>
        <p>The police have not released the girl's name or her family's name, because of her age.</p>
        <p>There was no response yesterday at the family's apartment, where an American flag hung from the front porch and where neighbors described the girl as well mannered, considerate and friendly. ''This child is a good child,'' said one next-door neighbor who did not want to be identified. ''If she's going to the store, she stops in and asks if we need something. If I'm making cookies, I ask her to come in.''</p>
        <p>The parents were regular customers at a nearby tavern, and several employees there described them as a hard-working couple who had lived in the area for several years. Naceur Zayer, owner of Staten Island Deli Express, recounted yesterday a conversation he had with the girl's father only six months ago. He said the father had stopped in for soft drinks after taking his daughter to her basketball game. ''This is the only way to keep them out of trouble -- to keep them busy,'' Mr. Zayer recalled the father saying.</p>
        <p>One tavern employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the couple's other children were the first to raise the alarm early Monday evening. ''One of the kids was telling them, 'She's sick, she's sick,' and then her father broke down the bathroom door to get to her,'' the employee said.</p>
        <p>A friend and neighbor, Rosanne McCormick, 31, said she spoke briefly with the girl's mother as emergency crews were carrying the girl to the ambulance. It was evident, Ms. McCormick said, that the girl's mother was baffled by the cause of the bleeding. ''She had no idea,'' Ms. McCormick said, referring to the pregnancy. ''They had no idea.''</p>
        <p>Doctors quickly determined that the girl had just given birth, and her father returned to their apartment and found the baby, police officials said.</p>
        <p>Neighbors described Mr. Frakes as a tall, thin man who walked about the neighborhood with his pit bull, and who sometimes flirted with younger girls. One neighbor, Brigitte Gourdin, said her husband nearly got into a fight with Mr. Frakes after hearing from neighbors that Mr. Frakes had been making advances toward their 13-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gourdin said yesterday that the parents of the girl who gave birth did not adequately supervise their children. The children, she said, were allowed to stay out on the street until late at night, and their home was frequently left in a mess. ''We gave them clothes for their kids,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Neighbors said that they had complained in recent months to the city's Administration for Children's Services about the children's being neglected.</p>
        <p>Jennifer Falk, a spokeswoman for the child welfare agency, said yesterday that in 1997, after receiving complaints of abuse at the house, agency investigators found that the parents had used ''excessive corporal punishment'' with their children. She said the parents were ordered to undergo classes in child care.</p>
        <p>Asked about more recent complaints, Ms. Falk replied, ''This is all the information that I can give you at this time.''</p>
