        <p>The Hezbollah militia, known for its rockets and bombs, is back in southern Lebanon in force -- this time with an army of doctors, nurses, veterinarians, bulldozers, agronomists and engineers.</p>
        <p>One week after the last Israeli soldiers abandoned the rocky hillside villages that they controlled for nearly 18 years, the business of keeping the water pumping and the hospitals running for an estimated 75,000 Lebanese civilians has been taken on by Hezbollah.</p>
        <p>In this ragged town of 13,000, which served as a military headquarters for Israel and its Lebanese allies during their occupation of southern Lebanon, Hezbollah workers have set up metal dispensers filled with drinking water in the streets because a pipeline that had been bringing drinking water from Israel has been closed.</p>
        <p>Here and throughout the south, Hezbollah workers have also bulldozed debris from the streets and widened the narrow roads. They have sent in insecticide-spraying trucks to kill mosquitoes. They are surveying the damaged and destroyed buildings to decide how much material to provide for reconstruction. They drive from village to village in nine modern mobile clinics and have sent in doctors and nurses to run an additional nine stationary clinics.</p>
        <p>In Beit Jbail, the Hezbollah health organization has also taken over the regional hospital, which was abandoned during the withdrawal by the local Lebanese doctors who used to be paid by Israel to run it. The new management quickly renamed the place, which used to be called simply Beit Jbail Hospital, in honor of a comrade who died in a guerrilla attack on the town's Israeli military guard post.</p>
        <p>''We're not trying to take over,'' said Fouad Taher, who manages another Hezbollah-owned hospital in Lebanon and was dispatched to help run the one here. ''The government should take its normal place. The only reason we took this hospital is that we knew the people really needed these services.''</p>
        <p>In the power vacuum left by the sudden withdrawal of Israeli troops and the flight of many of their allies in the South Lebanon Army, Hezbollah has started to operate in the south much as it does in the rest of Lebanon, as a kind of parallel government offering social services, development loans and reconstruction aid.</p>
        <p>Although it is still considered by the United States and other nations to be a terrorist group that bombed embassies and kidnapped Westerners in the 1980's with the help of radical patrons in Iran and Syria, Hezbollah has developed a different image in Lebanon.</p>
        <p>Its network of services and institutions has helped it become one of the country's strongest political parties in recent years, with nine representatives now in Parliament.</p>
        <p>When other Lebanese militias were forced to disarm in the last decade, Hezbollah maintained its weapons, turning them on Israelis and members of the South Lebanon Army. Hezbollah operations in the south, first as a guerrilla movement attacking Israeli positions in the occupied buffer zone and now as a rapid-reaction force to maintain public order, are likely to further its political ambitions.</p>
        <p>For the moment, no one in the Lebanese power structure appears willing or able to challenge Hezbollah, or the Party of God, which is lauded by every faction and religious grouping here as the liberator of national territory. The government, which is still haggling with the United Nations over whether the Israeli withdrawal is complete, has refused to send its army to the south.</p>
        <p>Syria, which is the major power in Lebanon and has 30,000 troops stationed elsewhere in the country, has done little but congratulate Hezbollah, although Syria has acted to try to limit the group's political power in Lebanon.</p>
        <p>In the last two days, thousands of Lebanese, including mayors and federal government officials, have crammed into the Beirut sitting room of Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's general secretary.</p>
        <p>Sheik Nasrallah, who does not hold a government or parliamentary post, has acted deferential toward the official government, saying his organization has no intention of setting up a parallel or competing structure in the south.</p>
        <p>The Hezbollah directors of the Bint Jbail hospital, for instance, courteously showed the Lebanese minister of health, Karam S. Karam, around the facility today.</p>
        <p>Dr. Karam, who was accompanied by a French delegation that had arranged a training program for Lebanese doctors who were scheduled to operate the hospital after the Israeli retreat, said he is grateful that Hezbollah moved quickly.</p>
        <p>''When the Israelis withdrew, it was chaotic,'' Dr. Karam said. ''So those working in the hospital fled. Then thugs came in and started taking things. The ones who came immediately to establish order were Hezbollah. They are organized and they are fast.''</p>
        <p>Still, Dr. Karam said, he is ready to take on the hospital. So when he returned to Beirut, he paid a call on Sheik Nasrallah, who offered reassuring words: ''He told me, 'The minute you decide to take it over, we will give you the keys,' '' Dr. Karam recalled.</p>
        <p>Hezbollah banners, meanwhile, are draped across countless electric poles, buildings and even junk piles throughout the south now. So are the banners of the Jihad-al-Binaa Association, Hezbollah's reconstruction arm. Its engineers and architects are making a survey of every building in the area, its insecticide trucks are spraying, its veterinarians have examined livestock and its trucks have provided water.</p>
        <p>None of those services have been provided by the Lebanese government, which began only three days ago to work on a new water pipeline to villages once served by Israeli water.</p>
        <p>For 12 years, the Jihad-al-Binaa has been rebuilding houses in Lebanon that were destroyed by Israeli bombs, as well as running two agricultural extension centers and advancing money to farmers. Like its parent organization, the reconstruction agency saw its work as part of the battle with Israel.</p>
        <p>''At the time of the war against Israel, it was a weapon in the struggle,'' said Ibrahim A. Ismail, the general manager of Jihad-al-Binaa. ''We fought Israel through development of Lebanon.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ismail said the group's preliminary estimates show that 1,600 houses in the former buffer zone have been destroyed since 1978, when Christian militias allied with Israel began attacking many Muslim areas. Another 1,200, he said, may have been partly destroyed.</p>
        <p>''After our survey of the houses, we will see if we can give help,'' he added, ''although that is not our job. It's the government's job.''</p>
        <p>Hezbollah's energetic efforts may have already paid off in terms of reducing tensions among Lebanese in the south and particularly among Christians, who had feared that they would be the target of the Muslim militiamen.</p>
        <p>In the first days after the withdrawal, Hezbollah clerics visited many of the remaining priests and Christian leaders and Hezbollah fighters helped to stop some of the looting that took place after Israel's allies fled their homes.</p>
        <p>''They came and talked to us and told us not to worry,'' said Ibrahim Yunis, a schoolteacher in the small Christian village of Dibel, near Beit Jbail, where two-thirds of the residents fled to Israel during the withdrawal.</p>
        <p>''It's not at all what we were led to expect,'' he added. ''The whole picture has changed from black to white, from what we used to hear about what Hezbollah would do to us to what we now are feeling.''</p>
