        <p>NEWS  Listen to This  ''This is a definite New York story,'' Diane  Wolkstein said. She was referring to ''The Most Incredible Thing of All,'' a little-known Hans Christian Andersen tale of a princess's search for Mr. Right that will lead off ''Stories 2000,'' a new season of storytelling from 11 a.m. to noon each Saturday  through Sept. 30 at the statue of Andersen at 72nd Street and Fifth Avenue by the boat pond in Central Park.

        <p>NEWS  Listen to This  ''This is a definite New York story,'' Diane  Wolkstein said. She was referring to ''The Most Incredible Thing of All,'' a little-known Hans Christian Andersen tale of a princess's search for Mr. Right that will lead off ''Stories 2000,'' a new season of storytelling from 11 a.m. to noon each Saturday  through Sept. 30 at the statue of Andersen at 72nd Street and Fifth Avenue by the boat pond in Central Park. Storytellers from the United States and Canada will relate tales from around the world at each session.</p>
        <p>Production Lines  Remember when mass-produced products like Campbell's Soup and Brillo inspired mass-produced art? Remember when serious artists put a popular spin on everything from the Hollywood glamour of Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe to a baked potato topped with sour cream? Pop Art multiples, those original editions created by mass-production techniques, are the focus of an exhibition that opens on Friday at the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio. In ''The Great American Pop Art Store: Multiples of the 60's,'' more than 100 works by artists like Jim Dine, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, James Rosenquist, Andy Warhol and Tom Wesselmann will be displayed through Aug. 13.</p>
        <p>Eye and Ear  Music by Debussy, Ravel and Franck. Images by Renoir and Monet. Music by Beethoven and Brahms. Nights that blend classical music and great art are in store beginning tomorrow at the Montreal Chamber Music Festival 2000. Using the theme ''The Joy of Life'' the festival features six evening chamber concerts through June 10 at the Chalet de le Montagne atop Mont Royal. The talent includes the pianists Ursula Oppens and Jerome Lowenthal, the violinist Eugene Drucker, the cellist Dennis Brott, the Artemis Quartet and the Lark Quartet, among others. In conjunction with the show at the Museum of Fine Arts in Montreal of paintings from the Orangerie in Paris, the festival will project masterpieces on a screen while music reflecting the art and artists is played. The musicians will also give chamber performances at the Chapelle Bonsecours and outdoor concerts.</p>
        <p>Fun City  If laughter is the best medicine, New York should be one of the world's healthiest cities from tomorrow through June 10, when the Toyota Comedy Festival presents more than 200 comedians at 70 events at more than 30 sites. At 9 p.m. on opening day, Greg Fitzsimmons of ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' will appear at Stand Up New York. On Friday Alan King will be among the performers at 12:30 p.m. in Bryant Park. And on June 6 the 92nd Street Y will be the setting for a Friars Club roast of Norm Crosby and Jack Carter.</p>
