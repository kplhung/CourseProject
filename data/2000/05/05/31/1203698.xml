        <p>The union representing 35,000 Bell Atlantic workers in New York and New England announced yesterday that it had called off a strike scheduled for today after the company agreed to rescind changes it had ordered in the workers' health plans.</p>
        <p>Even though the union's contract does not expire until Aug. 5, the union, the Communications Workers of America, called for the strike out of anger that Bell Atlantic had increased co-payments for the workers' health maintenance organization plans.</p>
        <p>Strikes in the middle of a contract are rare, but the union, which represents operators, technicians and service representatives, insisted that Bell Atlantic had committed unfair labor practices by making such changes without first bargaining with it.</p>
        <p>Bell Atlantic officials denied that the company had done anything improper, although an administrative law judge with the National Labor Relations Board ruled that the company's decision to raise co-payments on doctor visits was an unfair labor practice. In the agreement between the company and the union, Bell Atlantic agreed to drop its appeal of the judge's decision.</p>
        <p>Federal labor law generally bars unionized companies from unilaterally changing wages, hours or other conditions of employment, including health insurance coverage, without first bargaining with the union.</p>
        <p>Larry Mancino, vice president of the union's New York-New England district, declared victory in the dispute because the company had reversed the health plan changes. By showing militancy and threatening to strike, union officials said, the union hoped to show management that it would take a firm stance in the negotiations before the current two-year contract expires on Aug. 5.</p>
        <p>To settle the health plan dispute, Bell Atlantic agreed to reverse any increases in co-payments for doctors, prescription drugs, emergency room visits or other items. The company also agreed to reimburse workers who had paid the increased co-payments.</p>
        <p>''Our strategy,'' Mr. Mancino said, ''succeeded in protecting our members from Bell Atlantic's illegal increases in H.M.O. co-pays.''</p>
        <p>Steven Marcus, a Bell Atlantic spokesman, said the company had said all along that the best way to resolve such disputes was through negotiations. ''We are encouraged by the agreement, and we believe it sets a positive tone for the upcoming negotiations.''</p>
        <p>A major issue in the negotiations is the union's demand that Bell Atlantic allow thousands of nonunion workers in its cell phone division to unionize by merely having a majority of such workers sign cards saying they want a union.</p>
        <p>Federal labor law allows companies to insist on a formal vote to determine whether a majority of workers wants to unionize. But the union insists it would be fairer and faster to let the workers express their wishes by signing the cards.</p>
