        <p>When the Giants convene at Giants Stadium today for their veteran spring minicamp, they will do so without eight starters from last season's team, a number that is rising daily. On Thursday or soon after, the Giants are expected to release middle linebacker Corey Widmer in a salary-cap maneuver.</p>
        <p>The team has also had numerous discussions with its medical staff trying to determine if fullback Charles Way, who has had two recent operations on his right knee, will pass the team's physical and be able to play this year.</p>
        <p>Way, who will not participate in today's minicamp, had an unusual surgical procedure on the knee -- cartilage from a cadaver was inserted in the joint -- nearly two months ago. He recently began running and doing agility drills and is optimistic he will make a full recovery.</p>
        <p>But there is no agreement over the pace of Way's recovery, whether he will be ready for this summer's training camp, or if the knee will ever withstand the rigors of a full National Football League season. Team officials have said Way has at best a 50-50 chance to be fit by this summer.</p>
        <p>The Giants have said they want to give Way every opportunity to remain with the team, but they may choose to cut him and sign a free-agent fullback, like Sam Gash, who has been interviewed by team officials and has passed a team physical.</p>
        <p>''It will be a medical decision,'' Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi said yesterday. ''We'd love to have Charles, but if he can't play, he can't play.''</p>
        <p>The fullback this season will likely have a lesser role anyway. The team is looking at using Ron Dayne, the top draft pick, in a one-back set and will expand the role of Sean Bennett, a 230-pound, second-year back. Greg Comella is the team's other fullback.</p>
