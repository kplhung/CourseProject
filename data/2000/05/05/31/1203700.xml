        <p>A federal official and members of the City Council yesterday accused  Mayor Rudolph W.

        <p>A federal official and members of the City Council yesterday accused  Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the head of his Human Resources Administration of dragging their feet in qualifying for a huge federal jobs program, putting New York at risk of losing millions from the first installment of annual federal aid.</p>
        <p>''The city is very far behind,'' said Marilyn K. Shea, the regional administrator of the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration, and the federal official who oversees the jobs program in New York and New Jersey. She said it would be difficult for the city to have everything in place by the July 1 deadline for the program, which allocated $615 million for New York City over five years.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shea's comments followed her testimony at a City Council committee hearing, where the mayor and Jason A. Turner, the H.R.A. administrator, came under withering criticism for the city's belated efforts to qualify for the money under the Workforce Investment Act, the jobs program signed into law by President Clinton in August 1998.</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Turner acknowledged at the hearing that no board had been formed to supervise the city's participation in the program. Although it would be appointed by the mayor, federal rules require that the board be composed mainly of people from the private sector or organizations outside City Hall, including executives from business, labor and education.</p>
        <p>The federal rules also require a detailed five-year plan for how the city would spend the jobs program money. Mayoral aides said a plan had been drafted but that it must still be reviewed and made available for public comment, then adopted by the new board, by July 1.</p>
        <p>''Let's get this straight,'' said Councilman Stephen DiBrienza, the chairman of the General Welfare Committee, which conducted yesterday's hearing. ''You have to set up a board, and the board has to adopt a plan. It will not have enough time, and my guess is it will just accept what has been presented to it.'' He charged that the slow progress of City Hall was calculated as a way for the mayor and Mr. Turner to assert control over the use of the money.</p>
        <p>City Hall officials said yesterday that the mayor was considering the names of several candidates for the board and that the July 1 deadline would be met.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shea, while criticizing the city for tardiness, said the Department of Labor was ''not on a July 1 collision course with New York.'' She added  that the city was not in jeopardy of losing more than a small part of the  $123.6 million allocated to New York for the first year.</p>
        <p>Federal guidelines require that the Workforce Investment Act money be used to create what Congress called a one-stop delivery system, in which job referrals, counseling and training would be provided at centralized urban centers for people of all ages.</p>
        <p>The city has already opened the first such center in Jamaica, Queens, and the federal money would probably be used to create other centers in each of the other boroughs and a network of smaller counseling and referral centers, Giuliani administration officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiBrienza said the federal program could be used by Mr. Turner to award contracts to private companies.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. DiBrienza said that Mr. Turner runs Human Resources ''like a personal fiefdom''  and warned that the federal jobs program would be used ''as a great big slush fund to reward his friends and associates.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner did not attend the hearing but responded through a spokeswoman, Debra Sproles, saying that the agency ''has complied with all the city's procurement requirements, and we disagree with Mr. DiBrienza's broad-based allegations.''</p>
