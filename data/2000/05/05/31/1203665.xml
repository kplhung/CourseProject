        <p>With a furor over his characterization of Japan threatening his party's hold on power, Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori stood before journalists for 40 minutes on Friday denying that he had blurred the boundary between church and state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mori's strenuous self-defense rested on his contention that in calling Japan ''a divine country with an emperor at its center,'' he had intended to say nothing more than that the emperor is a popular and cherished national symbol.</p>
        <p>But whatever the prime minister's intentions, by touching on a taboo subject with such little caution he has shown the jagged edge of a nostalgic form of nationalism that is enjoying a powerful resurgence among conservative politicians.</p>
        <p>His statement continues to embroil his office, giving his cabinet a 19 percent approval rating in a poll after he had made the remarks, the lowest ratings of any prime minister on the eve of national elections.</p>
        <p>The problem with the denials is that the pronouncement was a perfect summation of State Shinto, the racist official religion that that drove Japan's expansionism in Asia and its war with the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mori may have denied that he was advocating a state religion or deification of the emperor, as existed in the past, saying, ''That is utterly contrary to my personal belief.''</p>
        <p>But critics said it strained credulity for him to argue that his phrase, uttered before a Shinto political group, was unrelated to militarist Japan's wartime creed.</p>
        <p>''Of course he recognized the nuance of what he said, and tried to show his sympathy for the people he was addressing,'' Takeshi Sasaki, a professor of politics at Tokyo University, said. ''He tries to do this at whatever gathering. It may not have seemed like a very serious statement, but it has become a very serious matter.''</p>
        <p>To be properly understood, critics and historians say, the ''divine nation'' remarks must be seen in the light of recent right-wing statements and initiatives that call for, among other goals, moral indoctrination for youth, a clampdown on foreigners and a national holiday to honor the wartime emperor, Hirohito.</p>
        <p>Late last summer, conservatives in the legislature won passage of a law to legalize the flag and a national anthem that is a paean to the emperor. Others have begun agitating for rearming the country, potentially even with nuclear weapons. A deputy defense minister, Shingo Nishimura, had to resign in the fall in a storm of criticism after he made such a proposal.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the conservatives' project is the revision of a constitution written under American occupation and a dream of reversion to a mythical state that is strong and unsullied by undue foreign influences.</p>
        <p>That members of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed since 1955, except for a period of less than two years, openly contemplate such ideas is at once an expression of the party's strength and its weakness.</p>
        <p>The party remains powerful because more than ever it lacks an effective opposition. Even the diplomatic constraints of the cold war, when Japan was locked in an anticommunist alliance with the United States and several Asian countries, have faded.</p>
        <p>''Although many L.D.P. members have a reactionary view of history, they were not able to express themselves, because of the overwhelming influence of the United States on the one hand and because of the restraint required by the international situation in East Asia on the other,'' said Yasuaki Onuma, a professor international law at Tokyo University. ''However, with the sharp decline of the Socialist Party and the end of the cold war, the feeling of the majority is that we have gone too far in keeping silent on the issues of our relationships with others and national identity.''</p>
        <p>Although the constraints have loosened, the Liberal Democratic Party has been weakened by a decade of economic decline as severe as any advanced nation has experienced since the Great Depression.</p>
        <p>Even though there is no strong opposition, the party owes its governing majority to an unusual and unpopular alliance with a pacifist Buddhist-affiliated party. And nowadays, most voters are skeptical independents.</p>
        <p>Seen in this light, the appeals to the values and methods of the past may simply reflect a party desperately reaching to the past for answers to Japan's problems -- and to appeal to voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mori's plummeting poll numbers since the ''divine country'' remarks, however, strongly suggest that such a clumsy approach is doomed to backfire.</p>
        <p>And the ruling class's nostalgia may cost it more than votes. When a legislator states, as one did in Parliament this week, that Hirohito ''built today's peaceful and prosperous Japan,'' the first casualty is the truth.</p>
        <p>But beyond the historical record, as long as the leaders remain prisoners of an unexamined past, other countries will continue to look on Japan as an insincere, untrustworthy and potentially threatening nation.</p>
        <p>''The Mori refusal to retract his statement harms Japan, and understandably so, because for Westerners in particular, Pearl Harbor caused Japan to be labeled as treacherous,'' said Herbert P. Bix, an American historian at Hitsosubashi University in Tokyo, and author of a coming biography of Hirohito. ''His explanation borders on deceitfulness of the worst sort. Over and over again in Japanese politics, you can see leaders speaking out of both sides of the mouth, and the result is that Japan just isn't trusted.''</p>
