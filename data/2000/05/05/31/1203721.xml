        <p>In a nationally televised interview yesterday, Bob Knight said he met privately with Indiana University's president, Myles Brand, to discuss behavioral guidelines and not to apologize for embarrassing behavior on the eve of a trustees board meeting earlier this month.</p>
        <p>Knight also refused to acknowledge grabbing a former player by the throat despite a widely broadcast videotape showing that he did. He also insisted he did not need professional counseling to manage his anger.</p>
        <p>In his first public remarks since Brand's May 15 announcement that Knight would remain the Hoosier coach under ''zero tolerance'' guidelines, the coach conceded he had a problem with his temper, but said he was confident that he could keep it under control. Knight also said he was ''never close'' to resigning at any time during the seven-week investigation of his behavior that galvanized public opinion within Indiana and the nation.</p>
        <p>Knight promised he would adjust his behavior. He said he was doing so for his players as well as for the support shown by Brand, who he said made a tough but fair decision to keep him.</p>
        <p>''I have an obligation to that president, Myles Brand, to show he was right,'' Knight said in a live interview on ESPN.</p>
        <p>Knight, however, appeared to contradict Brand about what occurred at a May 13 meeting at the president's home in Bloomington. Brand had said he was leaning toward firing Knight but was swayed by how ''contrite and apologetic'' the coach was about several incidents -- including intimidating a secretary in the athletic department with foul language and by throwing a vase, as well as arguments and physical altercations with colleagues and subordinates.</p>
        <p>Knight said he did not go to the two-hour meeting to apologize and indicated that Brand wanted him to remain at Indiana; he also wanted to stay, so the discussion focused on future guidelines.</p>
        <p>He also said he had not viewed the videotape of a 1997 practice that shows Knight grabbing a former player, Neil Reed, by the throat. That incident started the investigation.</p>
        <p>''I hadn't choked anybody; I've never choked anybody,'' said Knight, though the investigation by two Indiana University trustees concluded that Knight grabbed the former player for 2.3 seconds, as well as engaged in a ''pattern of inappropriate behavior'' that had embarrassed the university.</p>
        <p>In addition to the strict guidelines, the university fined Knight $30,000 and suspended him for three regular-season games in the 2000-01 season.</p>
        <p>Although Knight said he did not need counseling to help manage his anger, he reiterated an earlier written apology that acknowledged his temper had often gotten the best of him. He said he had been working on it with the help of his wife, and said he did not anticipate a future incident that would lead to his termination.</p>
