        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a neophyte wine consumer but avid traveler to France for business, I wish to thank Eric Asimov for his cheerful, unpretentious accolade to the sauvignon blanc grape and its delicious manifestation, Sancerre from the Loire Valley (Tastings, May 17).</p>
        <p>Not only will I be heeding his suggestions for the myriad wedding showers and outdoor dinner parties lined up for summer, but I also appreciated his succinct yet thorough detailing of the grape, its origins, and the wine it produces.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a neophyte wine consumer but avid traveler to France for business, I wish to thank Eric Asimov for his cheerful, unpretentious accolade to the sauvignon blanc grape and its delicious manifestation, Sancerre from the Loire Valley (Tastings, May 17).</p>
        <p>Not only will I be heeding his suggestions for the myriad wedding showers and outdoor dinner parties lined up for summer, but I also appreciated his succinct yet thorough detailing of the grape, its origins, and the wine it produces.</p>
        <p>I agree with Mary Ewing-Mulligan, a reader who responded in a letter that the wine industry does little to help bewildered consumers.</p>
        <p>The fact that France names its wines after the places from which the grapes originate and we name them after the grapes themselves is enough to understand at least one thing: the wine industry is a complex, often abstruse business and we, the consumers, can use all the help we can get.</p>
