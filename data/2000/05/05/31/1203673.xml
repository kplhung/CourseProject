        <p>The web of scandal surrounding the mayor's office here got a little more complicated today.</p>
        <p>Judicial sources said that 15 city officials, including Mayor Jean Tiberi's top aide, had been put under formal investigation for election fraud.</p>
        <p>It was yet another blow to President Jacques Chirac's Gaullist party, which is maneuvering frantically to hold onto the mayor's office, one of the most prestigious posts in France. Apart from its wedding-cake ceilings and crystal chandeliers, Paris's city hall has a huge budget and provides a national platform for whoever runs it.</p>
        <p>With elections just 10 months away, Mr. Chirac's party, Rally for the Republic, has just dumped Mr. Tiberi as its candidate for re-election after five years of scandals and judicial investigations into his conduct.</p>
        <p>But the new investigations reach far beyond Mr. Tiberi and threaten  even to taint Mr. Chirac because they involve fixing Paris elections while he was its mayor.</p>
        <p>Focusing on computer records in one district of Paris, investigators have apparently found 859 names fraudulently added to electoral rolls  in 1995 by officials associated with the mayor's party. The race for mayor has proved so far to be one of the more entertaining political stories in France. Partly, this has to do with Mr. Tiberi, who has behaved like gum stuck to the party's shoe. Despite polls indicating that only 5 percent of Parisians consider him honest, Mr. Tiberi has pressed on, holding news conferences to deplore his treatment and to tout his accomplishments.</p>
        <p>At one point, Mr. Tiberi tried to force his party to put his candidacy to a vote of local members. But the party's national headquarters unveiled a little problem: the list of local members Mr. Tiberi had supplied contained 1,500 ghost members. Some had moved away, stopped paying dues or died. One party employee found seven strangers listed as living in her house.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tiberi is still threatening to run without the party's backing.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Tiberi has not provided the only theatrics. Half a dozen heavy-hitting politicians have thrown their hats in the ring and then retrieved them again.</p>
        <p>They include the party's former prime minister, Edouard Balladur, and Jack Lang, a Socialist who was former President Francois Mitterrand's culture and education minister and is still one of the best known faces on the French cultural-intellectual scene. Mr. Lang was recently drafted into Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's government, presumably to clear the way for Bertrand Delanoe,  Mr. Jospin's choice to become mayoral candidate of his Socialist Party.</p>
        <p>The Rally for the Republic has chosen Philippe Seguin as its candidate. Mr. Seguin is often described as large in stature and personality, and the party no doubt hopes that his presence will eclipse Mr. Tiberi's sordid reputation.</p>
        <p>The scandals attached to Mr. Tiberi have been unrelenting. His wife, Xaviere, before her conviction was set aside on a technicality, was found guilty of accepting $36,000 from the government for a 36-page report on a subject in which she had no expertise. At trial, a witness testified that Mr. Tiberi had suggested that she be given the job. Other scandals have involved awarding public housing contracts to party supporters. Allegations that some of the mayor's political cronies hold city jobs but do no work are still being investigated.</p>
        <p>The 15 officials now under formal investigation include Mr. Tiberi's deputy mayor, Jacques Dominati, who belongs to the Rally for the Republic's sister party, Liberal Democracy. The newspaper Le Parisien quoted him today as admitting to limited fraud in the 1989 election, but nothing ''very serious.''</p>
        <p>''It's just some activists who were a bit too enthusiastic and signed up extra names in my arrondissement,'' he told the newspaper. ''But there was no large-scale organization.''</p>
