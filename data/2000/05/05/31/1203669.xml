        <p>WHAT is this about big?'' Sir Anthony Hopkins asks in a new campaign for Britain's second-largest bank, Barclays P.L.C., which carries the tagline ''A Big World Needs a Big Bank.''</p>
        <p>''You know, seeing the big picture, having the big idea, clinching the big deal. Nobody wants to clinch the little deal. Who wants to do that? You'd be a little-deal clincher, a small shot.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, everything about Barclays' first branding campaign is big. The actors that appear in the three commercials are big names: Sir Anthony, Tim Roth and Nick Moran. Each actor commanded a big fee; according to reports, Sir Anthony received a very big $1.2 million. The commercials are directed by a big-time director, Tony Scott, who also directed ''Top Gun'' and ''Enemy of the State.'' The commercials themselves are shown on big screens at big movie theaters across Britain as well as on television and in print. And the campaign has already reached a big audience: Barclays estimates the campaign is reaching 80 percent of the British population.</p>
        <p>There is only one small problem with the $22 million campaign, which began this spring. Barclays is -- as Mr. Hopkins mockingly forgets the campaign's catchword, asking, ''Um, what's the word?'' -- well, small.</p>
        <p>The British bank is in the midst of a very big cost-cutting program that at the very least will make the 300-year-old financial institution smaller; it just closed 172 branches. Matthew Barrett, the bank's new chief executive, is hoping that by having a big brand, with the big reach of the Internet -- where he thinks most consumers will bank in the future -- he can counter the effect of the branch closings.</p>
        <p>''We believe it's a brand that is underleveraged,'' Mr. Barrett said. ''Brand is going to be increasingly important. When people are surfing the Internet, why will they pick one supplier versus another? It will be because they are aware of the brand.''</p>
        <p>The campaign, which was created by Leagas Delaney in London, was a challenge because of the traditionally staid image of British banking. ''The problem that Barclays had was similar to the other banks and financial institutions,'' said Tim Delaney, the agency's co-founder. ''Despite the enormous amount of money spent on advertising in the last 10 to 15 years, they are all perceived to be the same by customers.''</p>
        <p>While the commercial starring Sir Anthony waxing on about all things big has received the most attention, Barclays created two other commercials playing off of the ''big'' theme and several print ads. In the commercial starring Tim Roth, he cites the World Trade Center as an example of the tallest building in the world -- for only 29 days, until another was built even taller.</p>
        <p>Legas Delaney won the Barclays account, beating J. Walter Thompson, a unit of the WPP Group; the London office of Wieden &amp; Kennedy; and BMP DDB, part of the DDB Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group.</p>
        <p>Barclays settled on the unusual campaign after doing research that pointed them toward doing something a bit radical, at least for a bank.</p>
        <p>''Most banks, if you examine advertising around the world, they position themselves as trying to be the friend to the customer,'' Mr. Barrett said. ''Bankers want to be loved and that never flies. People have lives, they have their own friends. They don't need us for friends.''</p>
        <p>Customers may not need bankers as friends, but at least some Londoners have questioned why anyone would want to use a big bank as opposed to a small one with personal service.</p>
        <p>''That's taking it too literally,'' said Caitlin Thomas, head of brand advertising at Barclays. ''It was always a metaphor for the breadth and depth of the resources we provide. Bigness is not all bad.''</p>
        <p>Sir Anthony himself has come under increasing criticism for participating in the advertisement. In a hand-written postcard to a Labor Party politician, Gwenda Thomas, who had sought his support in her campaign against some of the branch closings, Sir Anthony said: ''It seems that I have been wholly responsible for leaving thousands of people destitute. I just have to set the record straight by saying that I do not run Barclays. I made a commercial back last June. But I suppose the press love to have a scapegoat, so why not an actor?''</p>
