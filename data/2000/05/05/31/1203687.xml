        <p>The police were searching for clues today in the fatal shooting of the police chief's granddaughter, who they believe became the unintended victim of a gunman who fired into her car at a drive-through restaurant on Sunday night.</p>
        <p>''We do know she was not the intended target,'' said Lt. Horace Frank, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department. ''She just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.''</p>
        <p>Chief Bernard Parks's granddaughter, Lori Gonzalez, who would have turned 21 next week, was shot about 10:15 p.m. on Sunday as she and a male companion were leaving the restaurant at La Brea Avenue and Jefferson Boulevard in the South-Central neighborhood of Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The gunman, described as a heavy-set African-American in his 20's, approached the passenger side of the car as it slowed and fired several shots into the car, the police said. The passenger ducked and Ms. Gonzalez, who was driving, was struck several times, the police said.</p>
        <p>The authorities were investigating whether the 20-year-old passenger may have been the intended target. The identity of the man was not made public. He was not injured.</p>
        <p>The police had no motive for the shooting, and continued to interview the passenger today.</p>
        <p>Officer Jason Lee, a public information officer, said the police were investigating the possibility that the shooting was gang related.</p>
        <p>Several gangs operate in the area, Officer Lee said, and drive-by shootings have been a problem. He declined to say whether Ms. Gonzalez's passenger was a gang member.</p>
        <p>Despite a gang problem, Officer Lee said the crime rate in the neighborhood had fallen about 30 percent over the last three years. The neighborhood is a mix of commercial and residential buildings, with numerous strip malls and middle- to lower-income residents.</p>
        <p>The authorities speculate that the gunman, who may have had a grudge against Ms. Gonzalez's passenger, spotted him while they were at Popeye's Chicken and Biscuits restaurant.</p>
        <p>Workers at the restaurant said there had been no problems in recent years, although the restaurant is equipped with special security devices, including a protective shield at the counter.</p>
        <p>''It's an area that's had problems with criminal activities,'' Lieutenant Frank said.</p>
        <p>Some residents of the neighborhood have expressed concerns about drug dealers and gang problems.</p>
        <p>Chief Parks and his wife, Bobbie, were in seclusion today. They have four children and several grandchildren.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gonzalez, a student at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, was in Los Angeles visiting her mother when the shooting occurred, according to reports.</p>
        <p>Her father, Joe Gonzalez, told The Los Angeles Times that he and his wife had divorced 18 years ago. About two years ago, Ms. Gonzalez moved to Mission Viejo to live with her father, and enrolled at Saddleback College last summer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gonzalez described his daughter as ''wonderful with people and full of life.'' She had worked as a clerk at a drugstore and as an operator with Pacific Bell. She also taught Sunday school to third, fourth and fifth graders and had recently gone to Tijuana, Mexico, to build houses for the poor.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gonzalez was said to go frequently to Los Angeles to visit her mother and other relatives.</p>
        <p>The police were asking the public for assistance today in solving the killing, appealing to anyone who might have information.</p>
        <p>''This is a situation where we really need the public's help,'' Lieutenant Frank said.</p>
        <p>If the authorities are correct in their assumption that the passenger was the gunman's target, it will not be the first time a relative of the police chief has been at risk because of a passenger in the car.</p>
        <p>In 1998, one of Chief Park's daughters was charged with conspiracy to sell cocaine and trafficking in cocaine in Clark County, Nev., after she gave a ride to a man and unknowingly became enmeshed in a drug deal. The charges were dropped in October 1998 at the prosecutor's request.</p>
