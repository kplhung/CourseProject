        <p>The Clinton administration backed away today from its own harsh assessment that the presidential runoff election on Sunday in Peru was invalid. American officials privately voiced misgivings over competing American priorities there.</p>
        <p>The State Department reiterated the administration's concern and ''regret'' that President Alberto K. Fujimori had decided to proceed with the election despite allegations from international monitors that its fairness could not be guaranteed.</p>
        <p>Prodded by reporters at the daily news briefing of the department, a spokesman, Philip Reeker, refused several times to endorse remarks by an unidentified department official who told some of the same reporters on Monday that Mr. Fujimori's victory over the opposition candidate, Alejandro Toledo, was a result of a ''flawed process'' and, therefore, illegitimate.</p>
        <p>''The correct thing is to say that we haven't taken any steps or made any final determinations,'' Mr. Reeker said.</p>
        <p>The backpedaling occurred as the Organization of American States prepared to receive a report on Wednesday from the envoy it sent to observe the election, Eduardo Stein, and to consider steps it might take against Peru.</p>
        <p>A senior administration official said the move away from confrontational language was merely a tactical retreat. Many O.A.S. members resent United States influence over the 34-nation organization and fear perceived efforts by Washington to run their internal affairs.</p>
        <p>The official said the administration remained convinced that Mr. Fujimori's re-election, for his third five-year term, was not legitimate. But he said the remarks by the official on Monday had not been adequately examined by her superiors because of the holiday weekend.</p>
        <p>''Many of the countries in the region recoiled from that marker,'' the senior official said today.</p>
        <p>The administration is prepared to acknowledge an interruption of democratic government in Peru and will support a call by the Organization of American States for an emergency meeting of its foreign ministers, the official said.</p>
        <p>Still, officials in various United States agencies said today that they were largely torn over how to respond to the events in Peru. For all his autocratic tendencies, the officials conceded, Mr. Fujimori has managed to bring a measure of peace and prosperity to the country, enjoys considerable popular support and has been a stalwart in Washington's largely futile battle against drug producers.</p>
        <p>Branding him an undemocratic usurper could force action that would undermine hard-won American progress in an increasingly troubled region, the officials said.</p>
        <p>An American official who follows the United States drug strategy in Peru said some administration policy makers awoke today with misgivings. ''It's kind of like a jilted lover,'' the official said. ''You wake up the next morning and say, 'Oh no, I'm going to have to give away this and that.' Peru is such a pivotal country for us.''</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in the Andes, the official noted, the administration faces crises. Colombia, the chief drug exporter, has ceded ground to guerrilla bandits, and an American aid package for Bogota is bogged down in Congress. Ecuador is emerging from its own constitutional crisis, and Venezuela is increasingly under the personal control of Hugo Chavez, a military leader who was elected to the presidency after having led a failed coup attempt.</p>
        <p>''Kissing off Fujimori in any time frame is bad,'' the official said. ''At this moment, it's particularly acute. We have ulcers over what's happening in Colombia.''</p>
        <p>The agenda for Peru appears to leave administration officials at odds over priorities, said Cynthia McClintock, a professor of political science at George Washington University who is writing a book on United States relations with Peru in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>In its advocacy for democratic integrity, Professor McClintock said, ''the State Department is left competing against three important agencies,'' the Central Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon and the office of the White House adviser on drugs, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey.</p>
        <p>The senior administration official insisted that ''there is no trade off'' and that the United States would insist on fair elections because they were good for Peru and because they would ''strengthen the hemispheric commitment to democratic principles.''</p>
        <p>Officials close to the O.A.S. said Mr. Fujimori was largely unimpressed by international criticism and would most likely not respond to words not backed by deeds. ''He's going to try to tough this one out,'' a longtime official said.</p>
