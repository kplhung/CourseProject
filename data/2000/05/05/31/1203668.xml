        <p>Call Sgt. Pepper: Piano on the Loose</p>
        <p>John Lennon and YOKO ONO gave the art dealer SAM GREEN a 9-foot-long Baldwin concert grand in 1979. In 1988, Mr. Green sent it to the New York Academy of Art on Franklin Street in TriBeCa. A loan, Mr. Green says.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Green, whose friendships with the likes of Lennon, Greta Garbo and Andy Warhol once provided material for gossip columns and celebrity magazines,  wants the Baldwin back. But the academy's former executive director, BRUCE W. FERGUSON, maintains that it was a gift, not a loan. The academy was free to do what it wished with the piano, he says, and a couple of years ago, it was sold.</p>
        <p>Mr. Green has filed a $1.6 million lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, seeking the return of the piano, which was described in court papers as an ''extraordinarily valuable, special and unique item.'' The instrument came with an inscription: a small brass plaque above the keyboard that said, ''For Sam Love From Yoko and John 1979.''</p>
        <p>In court papers, Mr. Green's lawyer, MAHENDRA RAMGOPAL, asserted that the piano was ''to be redelivered to plaintiff on demand.'' The court papers say that Mr. Green also ''received assurances from the academy and Ferguson that his 'Lennon Piano' would be kept, maintained and secured on the premises of the academy.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ferguson, who left the academy last summer to become dean of the School of the Arts at Columbia University, said that the piano was sold a couple of years ago for ''a few thousand dollars.''</p>
        <p>''He's going to have to show that it's what he says it is and that it was a loan and not a gift,'' Mr. Ferguson said. ''My understanding was that it was an asset of the academy, that it was a gift. That was the full understanding of everybody involved.''</p>
        <p>STUART PIVAR, a founder of the academy and a former board member, told The Associated Press that Mr. Green first sought the return of the piano last month, after a California dealer offered to sell it to him for $100,000.</p>
        <p>Hitting the Beach For a Wedding</p>
        <p>''I should have just gotten married today,'' JODI DELLA FEMINA said as she scanned the crowd around the pool at her father's house in East Hampton, N.Y., on Saturday. ''I've got the guests. I've got the gown.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Della Femina does have marriage plans. On July 8, on the beach a few yards from where she was standing on Saturday, she will marry JOHN KIM, an investment banker who used to be a neighbor in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>For her wedding, she will wear white. On Saturday, she was wearing a sleeveless pink gown. The occasion was a party for the second edition of her guidebook to the back roads of eastern Long Island, ''Jodi's Shortcuts 2000.''</p>
        <p>The only thing that was missing for the wedding, Mr. Kim said, was the altar. It will be sculptured out of sand on the beach the day of the wedding.</p>
        <p>''This is like a dress rehearsal,'' Ms. Della Femina said.</p>
        <p>The crowd on Saturday? It included her father, the advertising executive and restaurateur JERRY DELLA FEMINA; STEVEN GAINES, the author of ''Philistines at the Hedgerow: Passion and Property in the Hamptons'';  LEONARD STERN, chief executive of a pet food and publishing conglomerate that also has substantial real estate holdings, and his wife, ALISON; the socialite ROZ JACOBS; SOMERS WHITE, an event planner at the Horticultural Society of New York; and JONATHAN FARKAS, an heir to the Alexander's department-store fortune.</p>
        <p>The fashion designer BETSEY JOHNSON showed up 24 hours late. The party had been entered as a Sunday event in her assistant's electronic organizer.</p>
        <p>''Just before we left to go there,'' Ms. Johnson said, ''we realized the party was Saturday night.''</p>
        <p>She called Ms. Della Femina's stepmother, JUDY LICHT. ''She said, 'Come on over, we're having a big family luncheon,' so I did,'' Ms. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>And her assistants?</p>
        <p>''They're all blaming it on the Palm Pilot,'' Ms. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>''Not me. I don't want to know about those things. I have my old-fashioned Filofax that I leave at the office.''</p>
