        <p>Up, Up and Above</p>
        <p>Larry Forgione is opening Above, on the 21st floor of the new Times Square Hilton, 234 West 42nd Street. The restaurant, which opens tomorrow, is adjacent to the hotel's aerie of a lobby, with vistas of the city. The Asian-accented American cuisine of the chefs, Kazuto and Vicki Fan Matsusaka, includes Copper River salmon carpaccio with ponzu vinaigrette, vegetable potstickers, anise short ribs and house-infused sakes.</p>

        <p>One and Growing</p>
        <p>Cello, 53 East 77th Street, will celebrate its first anniversary June 7 to 10 with a seven-course dinner at $130 a person, including a bottle of Champagne for each couple. Cello plans to  clone itself next year near Tysons Corner, Va.</p>
        <p>Dogs with Pedigrees</p>
        <p>Coney Island was never like this. Sure, there are hot dogs, fries and lemonade at F&amp;B, a new ice-blue sliver of a storefront at 269 West 23rd Street. But the fries are the very good Belgian kind, and the hot dogs can be ordered with sauerkraut and bacon, corn salsa and guacamole, or remoulade. The shop has a wine and beer license and serves Champagne splits.</p>
        <p>Grazing in TriBeCa</p>
        <p>The TriBeCa Grand Hotel, a sibling of the SoHo Grand, has opened at 2 Avenue of the Americas (White Street). It offers lounge dining with  everything from cocktail tidbits and desserts to heftier portions of chicken, all created by Rob Miketa.</p>
        <p>Chefs on the Move</p>
        <p>Mina Newman, formerly of Layla, is now at Dylan Prime, a steakhouse at 62 Laight Street (Greenwich Street). Marilyn Frobuccino is at the new Nino's Positano, at 890 Second Avenue (48th Street).</p>
