        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>CANADA: PRIVATE FILES DELETED  The government has moved to dismantle a huge computer database that could generate detailed files on 34 million Canadians, alive and dead. In face of protests, the Human Resources Ministry sent tax computer files back to the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, and government workers deleted a program that connected databases. A Human Resources Ministry spokesman said no backups existed of the files, which included health, tax, travel, employment and welfare records.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: LEFTIST SURGES IN POLL  Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the candidate for Mexico City mayor from the leftist party governing the city, has surged to a 17-point lead over two rivals, a poll of 1,109 people by the newspaper Reforma said. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent. His stunning rise came during a monthlong challenge to his residency credentials by President Ernesto Zedillo's party. A court threw out the challenge, and the candidate appears to be drawing support from voters who see him as a victim of official harassment.</p>

        <p>CHECHNYA: ATTACK CONTINUES  Continuing a large-scale offensive, Russian troops were trying to destroy a Chechen rebel force of about 400 in the southeast mountains. At the same time, Russia's government representative in Chechnya, Nikolai Koshman, said he had dismissed Bislan Gantimirov, a Chechen political figure freed from prison last fall and put in command of pro-Russian militia forces. Mr. Gantamirov was fired along with 295 members of his 353-member militia, a move seen as a setback in the effort to create a pro-Moscow security force.</p>

        <p>ITALY: FUROR OVER GAY EVENT  Rome's city leaders ran into heavy criticism for a decision by the municipal council to withdraw official and some financial support for a World Gay Pride festival planned for July 1-9. Mayor Francesco Rutelli was attacked by left-wing party chiefs and by Amos Luzzatto, president of Italy's Jewish communities, who praised homosexuals' bravery during persecution by the Nazis. But city leaders appear determined not to let the festival clash with the Catholic Church's jubilee celebrations.</p>

        <p>IRELAND: POLICE HOLD TERROR SUSPECTS  As home rule returned to Northern Ireland, the police in Dublin and Limerick arrested five men suspected of membership in dissident republican groups like the Real I.R.A., the group behind the 1998 Omagh bombing that killed 29 people. Fifteen other men have been arrested and released in the last week after the seizure of bomb-making materials in Dublin. The I.R.A.'s promise to put its weapons beyond use has caused an increase in fringe republican activity.</p>

        <p>SWITZERLAND: MINE PROPOSALS  The Clinton administration presented proposals at a meeting in Geneva to strengthen land mine restrictions in a 1980 global weapons pact that has been ratified by some of the biggest users of the devices, including India, China, Pakistan and the United States, which have not, however, signed the 1997 Ottawa anti-mine accord. A State Department official said the proposals would, among other things, extend restrictions to mines dropped from planes and to anti-vehicle mines, in addition to anti-personnel mines. Adoption of the proposals would not come before December 2001.</p>

        <p>PAKISTAN: TAX STRIKE CONTINUES  Markets remained closed for the second day as merchants continued a strike against a tax survey intended to flush out tax evaders and to increase the paltry number of taxpayers in the country. Traders said they would continue their protests with a series of demonstrations in coming days.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: U.S. RULES OUT ARMS AID  After meeting President Chandrika Kumaratunga, Undersecretary of State Thomas R. Pickering ruled out American help to Sri Lanka for arms purchases that would aid the country in its battles with separatist Tamil rebels. But he also warned the rebels that the United States would not recognize a separate Tamil state and urged them to enter peace talks.</p>

        <p>INDIA: ACTRESS-POLITICIAN CLEARED  A film actress-turned-politician facing a number of corruption cases won a major victory when a Madras court acquitted her in a $2.3 million scandal involving the purchase in 1995 of 45,302 color television sets for local village councils. A judge in Tamil Nadu jailed seven others but found Jayalalitha Jayaram, chief minister of the province from 1991-96, not guilty.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: 44 SLAIN  Armed men believed to be from a militant Muslim group were reported to have killed at least 44 villagers, most of them Christians, on a remote eastern island, the latest of thousands of people to die in violence in the Spice Islands over the past 17 months. The attack follows a similar raid in the same area last week that took 34 lives.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>IRAN: SPEAKER ELECTED  The new Parliament elected a mid-ranking cleric as speaker after days of debate and compromise among pro-reform groups. Mehdi Karroubi, 63, was elected with 186 votes in the 290-seat assembly and faces a confirmation vote considered certain to approve him. Mr. Karroubi was a member of Parliament until 1992 when the conservatives defeated his pro-reform party. He re-emerged as a supporter of President Mohammad Khatami in 1997.</p>
