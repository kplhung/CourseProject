        <p>The euro strengthened to its highest level in a month against the dollar, fueled by speculation that the European Central Bank might intervene on its behalf and by signs of stronger growth in Europe. Though many analysts doubt the euro is about to reverse its long-term decline -- the currency has fallen nearly 25 percent since it was introduced in January 1999 -- a growing number of foreign-exchange traders seem to think it may have hit bottom. The euro hit its all-time low of 88.5 cents on May 19 and has since rebounded to an exchange rate of more than 94 cents. Adding to the momentum was new data showing that the German economy, Europe's biggest, could expand by 3 percent or more this year.</p>
