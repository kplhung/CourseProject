        <p>When the choreographer Ann Carlson presented ''Night Light'' on Thursday night, she made spectators move and performers stand still.</p>
        <p>The event was essentially a tour of the Chelsea district of Manhattan. The audience gathered on a corner and guides ushered it through the streets, lecturing on the area's history.</p>
        <p>What made the event special was the fact that at various points en route Ms. Carlson had performers posed in tableaux vivants based on archival photographs. On one tour,  participants saw a woman in a big hat and a veil portraying a newspaper seller of 1895, a woman and a child inspecting the merchandise of a 1903 fruit stand, people on horseback inspired by a view of 10th Avenue in 1929, a male thief disguised as a woman based on a news photograph from 1943 and men in clerical collars duplicating a scene at the door of the General Theological Seminary in 1955.</p>
        <p>''Night Light'' was both fascinating and slightly disappointing. The tableaux attracted attention, but there were not enough of them. Every night during the run of the production, six tour groups set out from different locations, and not all the tableaux that Ms. Carlson prepared were seen on each tour. That was unfortunate. Whereas many groups sponsor historical walking tours, the tableaux of ''Night Light'' tried to bring history to life. A few more placed along the tour would have made the past seem vividly present.</p>
