        <p>The party of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide gained firm control of the Haitian Senate in the May 21 election, preliminary results have shown.</p>
        <p>The results, released late Monday by the Provisional Electoral Council, gave Mr. Aristide's Family Lavalas party 14 of the 19 Senate seats at stake in Haiti's first parliamentary elections since 1997. In what may be a preview of the party's strength in the presidential election, the vote gives Lavalas a majority in Haiti's 27-member Senate.</p>
        <p>Of the other five seats up for election, an independent candidate won one race, while the results for the two seats from the capital, Port-au-Prince, have yet to be announced. The two remaining Senate seats for Grande Anse Province will be determined in an election June 11 after  electoral officials postponed the original date because of disorganization and technical difficulties in the weeks before the vote.</p>
        <p>The elections represent Haiti's first step at resolving a crisis that has left its government paralyzed and without access to $500 million in international aid since 1997. Bitter arguments between President Rene Preval, of Lavalas, and an opposition-led Parliament over the results of the 1997 legislative elections prevented the appointment of a prime minister for nearly two years. Last year, Mr. Preval appointed a new prime minister, but only after Parliament was dissolved, and the nation has been without a lawmaking body since then.</p>
        <p>The apparent sweep by Lavalas  did not extend to Parliament's lower house; there, its candidates won outright only 16 of the 83 seats. A runoff will be held on June 25.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Lavalas's strong showing places it in the lead for the presidential election in November, when Mr. Aristide is expected to seek a return to office.</p>
        <p>Opposition candidates have accused Lavalas of manipulating the recent election through a campaign of violence and intimidation that resulted in 15 politically motivated killings since late March. They also said that Mr. Preval forced postponement of elections three times to wear down opposition and secure a compliant Parliament for Mr. Aristide's return.</p>
        <p>A Lavalas spokesman dismissed those accusations. ''We have no totalitarian intentions,'' Yvon Neptune told The Associated Press. ''We want peace and security, so we can concentrate on the big problems.''</p>
        <p>But peace has been elusive. Today, poll workers in the Delmas section of Port-au-Prince set fire to the local election office when they were not paid. Last week, Lavalas supporters ransacked offices of a minor political party and killed a person, according to diplomats and election observers.  About 30 opposition candidates have been arrested on charges that many of the observers said were trumped up. Most have been released.</p>
        <p>''The overall take is that Lavalas did do very well in the elections,'' said a State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''But its heavy-handed tactics like with the arrests are marring what could have been a decent victory.''</p>
        <p>Disorganization has delayed the final tally, which could come later this week. In some cases, ballot boxes were dumped at collection stations, damaging records and making recounts impossible. But election observers said there was no indication of systematic fraud.</p>
        <p>''We're not saying there was absolutely no fraud,'' said Mary Durran, of the Organization of American States. ''It's just the nature of the fraud. It's not organized on a national and systematic level that would have an impact on the elections.''</p>
