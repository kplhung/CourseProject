        <p>The national howl of protest against President Alberto Fujimori's illegitimate re-election victory in Peru is a welcome sign of the country's political health, but it also poses a danger. Mr. Fujimori or his backers in military intelligence may feel cornered and strike back with violence. To prevent bloodshed, the international community must strongly support the protesters' goal of a legitimate election to choose a democratic government in Peru, and prepare to isolate Mr. Fujimori if he refuses, or uses violence.</p>
        <p>At this moment the most important outside voice belongs to the Organization of American States, which holds a meeting on Peru today and will doubtless discuss Peru in its annual general assembly meeting on Sunday. The O.A.S. should demand new and fair elections, and offer its services to help Mr. Fujimori and his principal opponent, Alejandro Toledo, agree on the terms.</p>
        <p>Historically when the O.A.S. faced this situation, it would execute a graceful diplomatic punt. In many ways the organization is more timid and disorganized than a few years ago, when democracy seemed to be ascendant in Latin America and leaders paid more attention to the O.A.S. But there is still some hope that it will stand firm.</p>
        <p>The most positive indication is the resolve of the group's election observer mission, the first to be very critical of an important O.A.S. member. The mission, led by the respected former Guatemalan foreign minister Eduardo Stein, declined even to monitor last Sunday's runoff election, saying that an inadequate vote tabulation method and a biased campaign environment meant the election could not possibly be a fair one.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stein will present his report to the O.A.S. today. The members at the meeting -- every country in the hemisphere save Cuba -- can then vote to invoke Resolution 1080, which enables the region's foreign ministers to take political action against a member whose democracy is interrupted. The other  members could withdraw their ambassadors from Peru, for example, though this has never been done.</p>
        <p>The chances that the O.A.S. will back democracy in Peru waned yesterday when a State Department spokesman backed away from unusually direct criticism of the election an American official had voiced the day before. Brazil's vote is also crucial, and the last statement from that country was tepid. Brazil's president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a defender of democracy, should take the lead in helping to restore it in Peru.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori is gambling -- perhaps successfully -- that Washington will quickly resume its cooperation with Lima, which has been an ally in fighting cocaine and terrorism. He is also hoping the O.A.S. will undercut Mr. Stein's observer mission and go back to its blander ways. But if the hemisphere returns to diplomacy-as-usual, Mr. Fujimori will have a license to intensify repression in Peru.</p>
