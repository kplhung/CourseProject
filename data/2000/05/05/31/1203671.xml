        <p>Princeton University's president warned graduates today that crumbling respect for authorities and institutions meant that a sense of moral purpose must temper their use of technological and scientific advances like genetic research.</p>

        <p>Princeton University's president warned graduates today that crumbling respect for authorities and institutions meant that a sense of moral purpose must temper their use of technological and scientific advances like genetic research.</p>
        <p>''We have to accept the fact that in a world that is changing as fast as ours, all thoughtful citizens will have to share in the anguish of finding the right moral perspective within which to accommodate these changes,'' said the university president, Dr. Harold T. Shapiro, who is the chairman of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission.</p>
        <p>''Today, we strain harder than ever before to define ethical guidelines that will help us to navigate this flood tide of discovery,'' he added, ''as we struggle to construct new moral perspectives within which science and technology can thrive.''</p>
        <p>On a cloud-covered day, the university conferred 1,092 bachelor's degrees and 625 advanced degrees. Some form of honors was awarded to 44.4 percent of the seniors.</p>
        <p>Five honorary degrees were also conferred. In the sciences, honorary doctorates were awarded to Val L. Fitch, a Nobel winner and the James S. McDonnell distinguished university professor of physics at Princeton, and to Mary F. Lyon, the British researcher whose work in mouse genetics led to the discovery of a sex-linked gene mutation process.</p>
        <p>In the humanities, honorary doctorates went to Mae C. Jemison, the first African-American woman astronaut, and to Wendy Kopp, the founder and president of Teach for America, a national teacher corps of recent college graduates.</p>
        <p>An honorary law doctorate was awarded to Gordon E. Moore, a cofounder of Intel.</p>
        <p>The valedictorian, Andrew Houck, an electrical engineering major, spoke about the significance of trees in an address that drew a standing ovation.</p>
        <p>''A society grows when the old men plant trees in whose shade they will never sit,'' Mr. Houck said, quoting a Greek proverb. ''I would encourage all of us not to spend our entire lives lounging in our ancestors' shade, but to venture out in the sun ourselves, ensuring a well-shaded future for the comfort of those to come.''</p>
        <p>On Sunday, Queen Noor of Jordan spoke to graduating seniors about the importance of public service, and reminded them that poverty and despair were common throughout the world despite technological advances and a booming economy at home.</p>
        <p>After today's ceremony, graduates filed onto Nassau Street through the FitzRandolph gates for the first time in their careers. Although the gates are open all year, by tradition undergraduates avoid them until they graduate.</p>
        <p>Cornell University</p>
        <p>On a gray, chilly Sunday afternoon in Ithaca, N.Y., 6,000 undergraduate and graduate students filled Schoellkopf Field, from end to end and sideline to sideline, for Cornell's 132nd commencement.</p>
        <p>The approximately 3,700 undergraduates were reminded of a far more somber occasion that marked their first year on campus: the death in December 1996 of Carl Sagan, the popular science writer and Cornell professor.</p>
        <p>''Everyone, even if they never met him, was impacted by losing him,'' said the class president, Julie-Anne Dittmer. Remarking that he ''could have been such a tremendous resource over the years,'' she said, ''There was something different on the campus after that.''</p>
        <p>On Saturday, Ms. Dittmer addressed her classmates at Convocation Day, urging them to retain their school friendships in the future.</p>
        <p>In an interview, she said: ''You get so busy that you forget you're leaving for a while, but it finally hit me the other day when I was going through the yearbook. The tears started flowing then.''</p>
        <p>The commencement speaker, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, told the graduates that many of their best moments were ahead.</p>
        <p>''The excitement is just beginning,'' he said. The best times and the great adventures of graduates' lives are ''beginning at a historic time,'' he said. ''We live in a new world where everything is changing.''</p>
        <p>He emphasized the point by telling the gathering that in 1993, when most of the seniors were starting high school, there were 13 Web sites on the Internet. ''Today, seven years later,'' he said, ''there are more than 14 million.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 1, 2000, Thursday  An article yesterday about Cornell University's graduation exercises misidentified the event at which Charles E. Schumer of New York spoke. It was the senior convocation on Saturday, not the commencement on Sunday. The commencement address was given by the university's president, Hunter R. Rawlings III.</p>
