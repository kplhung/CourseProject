        <p>Hans Snook, chief executive of Orange P.L.C., Britain's third-largest wireless telephone operator, stood before an audience of financial analysts here six months ago extolling the benefits of combining with the German conglomerate Mannesmann, which had bought Orange for $33 billion.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Snook made a similar presentation, only this time, the interactive slide display he showed had a different company's logo in the corner as Orange's new parent: France Telecom, the former state-owned telephone monopoly.</p>
        <p>The sale of Orange to France Telecom for about $37.5 billion in cash and stock by Vodafone AirTouch P.L.C., Mannesmann's new parent, represents more than just another telecommunications deal. It demonstrates the rapid pace of change in Europe's wireless telephone market.</p>
        <p>''I feel like I've been here before,'' Mr. Snook said today at a news conference to announce the deal.</p>
        <p>The sale of Orange to Mannesmann in late October was the catalyst for a string of mergers and acquisitions in European telecommunications. Since that deal, Vodafone, the world's leading wireless company, has bought Mannesmann for a record $183 billion, which forced the sale of Orange to satisfy regulators worried about Vodafone's dominance. NTT DoCoMo of Japan took a 15 percent stake in the Royal  KPN's mobile unit, KPN Mobile, earlier this month, in part to make a combined bid for Orange, executives from those companies said at the time. And Telefonica of Spain and Royal KPN tried unsuccessfully to marry their businesses recently -- to compete in a marketplace that has fashioned behemoths like Vodafone -- and now, France Telecom.</p>
        <p>The deal catapults France Telecom into a new league, putting it within competitive reach of Vodafone and possibly creating a rivalry between them.</p>
        <p>France Telecom plans to use Orange as its vehicle for competing in the wireless market by combining the France Telecom wireless units, Itineris, with Orange's operations to create a wireless operator in Europe projected to have 30 million customers by year's end, second only to Vodafone's 35 million. Itineris is the largest wireless company in France, with more than 10 million subscribers and operations in Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Austria and Switzerland.</p>
        <p>''The acquisition of Orange and the creation of New Orange is a major step in France Telecom's strategy to become a European leader and global player,'' said Michel Bon, chief executive of France Telecom.</p>
        <p>The French company has faced a string of problems recently as it sought to expand throughout the Continent. The most notable example of its recent trouble was its losing bid for E-Plus Mobilfunk, the German mobile phone company. France Telecom also failed to win a third-generation mobile license in Spain, limiting its ability to offer service there. And its alliance with Deutsche Telekom, the giant Germany telecommunications company, unraveled.</p>
        <p>So combining with Orange is considered a major coup for France Telecom.</p>
        <p>But the real winner may be Mr. Snook and the company he founded seven years ago. Orange started as the fourth entrant in Britain's highly contested wireless market and not only became highly coveted by its acquisitive rivals, but also has the highest growth rate in Britain. Mr. Snook will run the combined wireless company and have relative autonomy over its management.</p>
        <p>The combined wireless company, which will be called Orange, will be incorporated as a separate company based in London. France Telecom expects to sell shares of 10 percent to 15 percent of what was referred to today as New Orange to the public within a year, valuing the company at 150 billion euros, or about $141 billion. It will be listed on exchanges in London, Paris and New York.</p>
        <p>The stock part of the deal means Vodafone will own about 10 percent of France Telecom, but the French company will have the right to repurchase those shares. Under French law, no company can own more than 10 percent of France Telecom.</p>
        <p>France Telecom will pay Vodafone about 55 percent of the acquisition price in cash and the rest in France Telecom shares. In addition, France Telecom will assume about $2.7 billion in debt and the $6.2 billion cost of Orange's third-generation mobile license in Britain that it won in a government auction.</p>
        <p>''I would say it's not cheap,'' said Jean-Louis Vinciguerra, executive vice president and chief financial officer of France Telecom. But he added, ''I think it is a reasonable price.''</p>
        <p>France Telecom is effectively paying 6,741 euros for each Orange customer, significantly below the 9,517 euros that Mannesmann paid for each Orange customer or the 9,198 euros that Vodafone paid for each Mannesmann customer.</p>
        <p>Investors bid France Telecom stock up 4.5 euros, or 3.1 percent, to 148.9 euros, or $138.71.</p>
        <p>Credit Suisse First Boston, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Rothschild and Salomon Smith Barney advised France Telecom. Dresdner Kleinwort Benson and DLJ International advised Orange. Vodafone was advised by Goldman, Sachs and UBS Warburg.</p>
        <p>The France Telecom-Orange deal was announced just as Vodafone reported that its fiscal 2000 earnings rose 30 percent, exceeding expectations. The company earned $:3.95 billion, 0r $5.91 billion, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, compared with $:3.05 billion a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Vodafone shares rose 20.75 pence, to 302 pence, or about $4.53. They have risen 25 percent in the last week. The company's American depository receipts, each representing 10 ordinary shares, rose $4.4375, or 11 percent, to $46.4375 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
