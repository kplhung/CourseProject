      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial urges change in New York State law, to allow battered women convicted of violent crimes against their abusers to enter work-release programs (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Under New York State law, prisoners convicted of violent crimes are not allowed into the work-release program. In 1995 Gov. George Pataki, concerned about crimes committed by inmates on work-release, made violent offenders ineligible for the program. While that prohibition makes sense in most cases, there should be an exemption allowed for battered women who have been convicted of violent crimes against their abusers.</p>
        <p>Last year the State Assembly passed a sensible bill that would allow convicted battered women to participate in work-release at the discretion of the state corrections commissioner. It died in the Senate, but earlier this year the Senate crime victims and corrections committee passed the measure. The Legislature should approve the bill promptly, and Governor Pataki should sign it into law.</p>

        <p>Victims of domestic violence are generally different from other violent offenders. Many of these women had no previous criminal records, and are not likely to be repeat offenders. Many were retaliating for years of physical, sexual and psychological abuse by their tormentors. Work-release is a crucial step for these women in making the transition from prison back into society.</p>
        <p>The bill would give the state corrections commissioner the authority to grant work-release on a case-by-case basis to victims of domestic violence, including men who have been battered. The commissioner could reject anyone who has a history of violence or is judged to be a threat to public safety. There are probably fewer than 100 inmates, the vast majority of them women, who could become eligible for work-release under this bill. It would give these prisoners, who have been victims of prolonged violence themselves, a chance to rebuild their lives.</p>
