        <p>Confronted by a mob bent on destroying the neighborhood, a World War I veteran put on his uniform and stood at attention in front of his house. It was Tulsa, Okla., in 1921, and he surely prayed that his recent military service would protect him. As a black man, however, he may also have suspected his actual fate was to be shot point blank by his fellow citizens, who were white.</p>
        <p>In one day that mob murdered more than 300 African-Americans and burned down the Greenwood neighborhood, one of the country's most prosperous black communities, referred to as the Negro capital of the Southwest. Greenwood, whose population had reached 15,000, had thrived on hope as well as hard work, making its destruction all the more improbable.</p>
        <p>This riot was perhaps the most devastating in the nation's history and destroyed any illusions that upward mobility could fend off racism. After the riot ended, in one survivor's words ''the heavy air was soaked with the scent of honeysuckle as extravagant and lavishly unreal as the gunfire.'' But someone else remembered a different scent. ''A terrible smell,'' she recalled. ''Did they burn bodies?''</p>
        <p>Local officials encouraged the destruction, so when the carnage stopped, the cover-ups began. For 50 years this ugly chapter was buried, and then exhumed by a new generation. Survivors came forward; old newspapers were dusted off and read. In 1997 the Oklahoma legislature created a commission to study the Tulsa riot -- to try to explain it and then to determine whether the state should pay reparations of some kind to Greenwood itself or to individual survivors. Its conclusions have yet to be delivered.</p>
        <p>Even before the commission was formed, Michael Wilkerson, an inspector for the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation turned documentarian, was working on his own examination of this shameful event. ''The Tulsa Lynching of 1921: A Hidden Story'' -- which Mr. Wilkerson produced, wrote, directed and jointly edited (with Michael Brown) -- is being shown tonight at 6:30 on Cinemax.</p>
        <p>Elderly survivors and witnesses recollect; historians comment; actors (including Bill Cosby, Nell Carter, Ed Asner and Alfre Woodard) read from newspaper and personal accounts. The style is straightforward, and that's fitting. The pyrotechnics are built into the stories of machine guns raining down bullets on civilians in peacetime, of women dragging children down residential streets to escape. Vivid photographs illustrate the horror (a scorched body) and the loss (rows of comfortable homes destroyed; well-dressed children turned into refugees).</p>
        <p>This explosion of emotion and firepower was detonated by an unproved allegation that a 19-year-old black man named Dick Rowland had assaulted a white female elevator operator. He was arrested and then word circulated that a lynch mob was gathering at the jail. A group of black men arrived to protect him. Someone fired a shot, which hit a black man, and the riot began.</p>
        <p>Within hours the police commissioned and armed 500 deputies, all of them white, except for at least one light-skinned black man, mistakenly enlisted. He reported that he and the other deputies were told: ''Now you can go shoot any nigger you see and the law will be behind you.''</p>
        <p>The documentary explains the context. Despite the prosperity evident in Greenwood, with its black businessmen, doctors and lawyers,  Oklahoma didn't exactly welcome blacks. The railroads were segregated, voting restricted and newspapers routinely reported lynchings of black people. The Ku Klux Klan, which had almost disappeared after the turn of the century, had been revitalized by the release of D. W. Griffith's ''Birth of a Nation'' in 1915. Klan recruitment ads ran next to newspaper advertisements for the movie.</p>
        <p>(This context is documented in ''Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America,'' a New-York Historical Society exhibition that runs through Aug. 13.)</p>
        <p>Tulsa officials tacitly and directly supported the mob as it looted, burned and killed, and even blocked firefighters from doing their jobs. The rampage was spontaneous but also calculated: telephone and telegraph wires were cut and trains blockaded to prevent outside interference.</p>
        <p>The National Guard did finally arrive and martial law was imposed, but the indignities continued. African-Americans had to register at detention centers; insurance claims by black families were rejected; city officials declared the Greenwood area a fire zone and put the land up for sale. Then the cover-up: the death toll was wildly underreported, a white grand jury placed blame for the riot on black residents, and newspaper articles encouraging the lynching of Dick Rowland disappeared from archives.</p>
        <p>This intelligent and troubling documentary raises lingering questions of guilt, retribution and reconciliation. We look at pictures of the ruins, and listen to the words of one Greenwood survivor: ''After that we distrusted every white person.'' What kind of reparations can fully heal that wound?</p>
        <p>THE TULSA LYNCHING  OF 1921  A Hidden Story  Cinemax, tonight at 6:30</p>
        <p>Written and directed by Michael Wilkerson; edited by Mr. Wilkerson and Michael Brown; produced by Mr. Wilkerson; Nancy Abraham, supervising producer; Sheila Nevins, executive producer.</p>
