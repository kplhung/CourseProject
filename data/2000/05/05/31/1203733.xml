        <p>Edward Daily had all the trappings of an American war hero: comrades who remembered his courage on the front lines, combat records attesting to his swift rise in rank, orders awarding him medals for valor.</p>
        <p>His exploits, including a rescue of a soldier under fire and his capture by the North Koreans, were amply supported by Army documents and the testimony of men who said they recalled fighting alongside him.</p>
        <p>When The Associated Press began investigating whether the Army unit he was assigned to -- the Seventh Cavalry Regiment -- killed hundreds of South Koreans nearly 50 years ago, Mr. Daily, who is 69, seemed an ideal authority on difficult terrain.</p>
        <p>He had written three books on the unit -- a proud, historic regiment once led by George Armstrong Custer -- organized its veterans group and swapped stories at its reunions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daily gave Associated Press reporters a list of ex-soldiers' telephone numbers. And he admitted his own role in the atrocity at the South Korean hamlet of No Gun Ri, saying he had slaughtered civilians on orders from his commanders and was still haunted by the sound of ''little kids screaming.''</p>
        <p>But the confession, his presence at No Gun Ri -- in fact, most of Mr. Daily's military record -- appears to be invented or imagined. And fellow veterans now say Mr. Daily, in telephone calls, chats at soldiers' reunions and barroom reminiscences, managed to airbrush himself into their own fragile memories of the Korean War.</p>
        <p>As Associated Press reporters tried to track down the story of what happened at No Gun Ri, Mr. Daily made his own calls to fellow veterans, several of them said. ''He tried to inform me how things happened,'' said Norman Tinkler, who is 69, a Seventh Cavalry veteran who told the news service he had emptied a machine-gun clip on defenseless people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tinkler stands by his account but says he cannot recall if The Associated Press or Mr. Daily called him first.</p>
        <p>The Associated Press stands by its story, and the Army's look at the No Gun Ri incident suggests that civilians were attacked, people familiar with the inquiry say.</p>
        <p>A look at Mr. Daily's life reveals a man who loved to hear other men's war stories and who went to extraordinary lengths to create his own legend in the past 15 years.</p>
        <p>So embedded is Mr. Daily in the memories of some veterans that they still find it difficult to believe he was not with them at No Gun Ri.</p>
        <p>''I know that Daily was there,'' insisted Eugene Hesselman, another key witness in the original Associated Press account. ''I know that. I know that.''</p>
        <p>Millard Gray, 75, of Fort Cobb, Okla., said he believed for years that Mr. Daily had rescued him on the battlefield -- until a buddy pointed out that he would not have been able to recall anything immediately after being pummeled by a concussion grenade.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gray, who was not quoted in the Associated Press account, said he now realizes that his memory of Mr. Daily pulling him out of a foxhole to safety came from Mr. Daily. ''I didn't know the difference,'' Mr. Gray said.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Daily said he did not dispute Army documents that show he was not at No Gun Ri, but rather spent most of the war as a mechanic and clerk behind the front lines.</p>
        <p>''I still remember it vividly,'' Mr. Daily said in an interview at his home here today -- Memorial Day, which he spent in seclusion. ''But they are saying I was with a different company. I've seen their documents. How do you deny that?''</p>
        <p>''I feel,'' he said, ''like I'm in a dream world.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Daily denied fabricating or altering any records. ''No, no, no,'' he said. Asked to explain how he came to show friends citations for some of the Army's highest medals, including the Distinguished Service Cross, he said, ''I can't explain it.''</p>
        <p>He declined to comment further on the records, citing the Army's continuing No Gun Ri investigation.</p>
        <p>The Associated Press won the Pulitzer Prize this spring for its article on No Gun Ri. Follow-up articles in other publications, including The New York Times, quoted Mr. Dailey and he was featured in a 30-minute special program by NBC News and a cover story in The Washington Post Magazine.</p>
        <p>In the days since questions emerged about Mr. Daily's war record, The Associated Press has noted that a host of other witnesses, including South Koreans, confirmed that an atrocity had taken place. In addition, The A.P. has cited a July 24, 1950, order to the division headquarters of the unit said to be involved in the shootings that read ''no refugees to cross the front line.''</p>
        <p>Charles J. Hanley, a reporter who worked on the Associated Press project and staunchly defends it, said that as many as 20 veterans confirmed some or all of Mr. Daily's account, and that the reporting team found sources outside Mr. Daily's sphere of contacts. Mr. Hanley acknowledged that Mr. Daily was a valuable source for The A.P., supplying ex-soldiers' telephone numbers early in the inquiry.</p>
        <p>''They all talked to each other in this investigation,'' Mr. Hanley said of the veterans. ''This is why it was important that we try to not get a grapevine going.''</p>
        <p>Still, it may have been an impossible task to determine whether Mr. Daily was harvesting memories or creating them.</p>
        <p>The citation he showed friends for the Silver Star, which praised Mr. Daily for ''bravely'' commanding his platoon under fire and rescuing another soldier appears to have been fabricated; Army records show he did not receive the medal or the promotion to which it refers.</p>
        <p>People familiar with the Army's inquiry into the purported massacre say investigators have obtained documents -- some from Mr. Dailey himself -- concerning Mr. Dailey's war record that they now consider falsified. One is a letter saying Mr. Daily had been taken prisoner of war. There are fabricated letters awarding him medals that he actually did not win, including the Silver Star, they said.</p>
        <p>There are two versions of the regiment's Christmas-dinner roster, one with Mr. Daily's name typed at the bottom of the list -- slightly crooked at that. A group photo of the regiment he showed to friends is also suspect: Mr. Daily's head, marked with an arrow and the word ''me,'' appears to be superimposed on another man.</p>
        <p>The Army is close to concluding that its troops fired on civilians at No Gun Ri, but that the number killed remains unproven. And the people familiar with the inquiry said the Army had thus far found only one man who made the crucial contention that there were orders to slaughter the civilians as they huddled in a railroad-trestle culvert at No Gun Ri: Edward Daily.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daily's assertions about his record were not universally accepted by his peers.</p>
        <p>He joined an association for winners of the Distinguished Service Cross, a medal military records show he never received. In 1991, Morris G. Worley, the administrator of the association, concluded that Mr. Daily had falsified his supporting documents and kicked him out. After discovering other false claimants as well, Mr. Worley now sends for the military records of anyone seeking to join the group.</p>
        <p>Why would Ed Daily, a Kentucky native who worked in steel mills, sold used cars and had a fondness for war antiques, falsely confess to an atrocity? Some observers believe there is a rise in the number of people exaggerating their military histories. Most want to remake themselves into heroes.</p>
        <p>But others are moved to claim a dishonor, psychologists say, like people who confess to crimes they did not commit.</p>
        <p>''It is not uncommon when a serious murder occurs for a couple of folks to drop by and say, 'I did it,' '' said Jonas Rappeport, a forensic psychiatrist now retired in Baltimore. ''The purpose of this seems to be self-importance.''</p>
        <p>Donald Down, a 68-year-old former steelworker and veteran of the Seventh Cavalry, is one of Mr. Daily's staunchest supporters. He helped Mr. Daily organize their veterans' group, and he thinks its members should back him no matter what the reality of his war experience.</p>
        <p>Some veterans who have come to doubt the massacre story regard Mr. Daily in terms they cannot explain.</p>
        <p>''I have the feeling now that Daily was a con man, although I don't know why he was,'' said William Hoffmann, 74, of Fairfax Station, Va., a former Seventh Cavalry platoon leader who retired from the Army and then worked as an executive with Amtrak.  ''How else could a nice guy who has been so strong in promoting the Seventh Cavalry and organizing the reunions and coming to them and giving speeches do this? I'm still puzzled.''</p>
        <p>Recalling the Service  Memories of War Grow in Importance</p>
        <p>Born in Covington, Ky., in 1931, Edward Lee Daily was 17 when he met an Army recruiting sergeant with ''medals plastered all over his chest,'' Mr. Daily wrote in a short memoir he would give to his friends.</p>
        <p>His mother, who divorced when he was 10, signed the teenager's papers, Mr. Daily said. When given a choice of assignments, he picked the cavalry, describing it as seemingly preordained. ''Strangely, my eyes kept focusing on that big yellow and black patch with the horse head on it,'' a reference to the shoulder patch of the First Cavalry Division, the parent unit of the Seventh Cavalry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daily also wrote about becoming an expert marksman with the Seventh Cavalry Regiment, then jumping into the opening days of the Korean War in July 1950.</p>
        <p>In fact, military records show, Mr. Daily served as a clerk and mechanic in the lusterless 27th Ordnance Maintenance Company, only joining the Seventh Cavalry for a few weeks the following year -- eight months after the No Gun Ri massacre is said to have occurred.</p>
        <p>After the war, Mr. Daily worked in a steel mill, ran a truck-stop cafe, and in 1978 became a salesman with Heuring Chevrolet in Valparaiso, Ind. ''He was the top salesman out of 25,'' said Craig Heuring, now general manager. ''Every customer loved him.''</p>
        <p>Married with a son, Mr. Daily seemed to have erased Korea from his mind, his former wife, Hilda Daily, said. ''It was a shock to me,'' she said of the Associated Press report. ''He never talked about the war.''</p>
        <p>But after his life took a hard turn starting in the mid-1980's -- his marriage broke apart, his work suffered, and, Mr. Daily said, he stepped up his mental-health therapy -- the war became a cornerstone in his life.</p>
        <p>The war was nearly all Mr. Daily talked about with Fred and Lois Carlen, who handled the photographs for his books in their Valparaiso photography shop. ''He liked war relics, and it was so funny to see Ed come in with this big sword,'' Mrs. Carlen said, recalling an antique sabre Mr. Daily would occasionally brandish.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daily began focusing on Korea after a 1986 reunion of cavalry veterans. ''If you guys will get me stories, I'll put them together and we'll put them in a book,'' Mr. Daily told attendees, Mr. Down said.</p>
        <p>At this and other reunions, the best stories emerged in the bar, and Mr. Daily had a knack for injecting himself into the conversation, veterans said.</p>
        <p>Robert Gray, 74, a former second lieutenant who spent five years with the Seventh Cavalry, recalled a reunion at Fort Meade, Md., in 1996. ''Daily asked me, 'Who is that?' I said, 'That's Johnny De Borde, my mortar observer.' ''</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, Mr. Gray said, Mr. Daily walked up to Mr. De Borde and said: ''How in the hell are you? It's been a long, long time, buddy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. De Borde recalled today, ''And he hugged me. I had not seen Daily before in my life.''</p>
        <p>Speaking of Mr. Daily's account of No Gun Ri, Mr. Gray said: ''Everyone assumed he was there. No one questioned it. He wove such a damn web.''</p>
        <p>Improving on History  Recollections Draw Skepticism and Praise</p>
        <p>Mr. Daily's own recollections of his invented combat experiences became grippingly real. In 1993, William McKown, the regiment's food service technician who spent 24 years in the Army and now lives in Englewood, Fla., returned to South Korea with a small group of veterans that included Mr. Daily. They were riding in a minibus, Mr. McKown said, ''alongside this river we were defending and this ravine went by, and Ed called out, 'That's where I was captured.' '' No evidence has surfaced that Mr. Daily was indeed taken prisoner.</p>
        <p>Part of the confusion over Mr. Daily's record stems from a 1973 fire which destroyed many files at the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>Veterans were invited to help reconstruct their records and Mr. Daily appears to have enhanced his own history with material provided by others in the Seventh Cavalry for use in his books. Mr. Daily said he did not recall any details about submitting documentation to the archives.</p>
        <p>Not everyone could be persuaded they had fought side by side with Mr. Daily, Mr. Tinkler, the machine-gunner, among them. Mr. Tinkler did not attend the unit's reunions and was startled by a call from Mr. Daily one day asking if he recalled how he bandaged Mr. Tinkler when he was shot in the shoulder.</p>
        <p>''I said 'hell no, I don't remember,' '' Mr. Tinkler recalled. ''I wasn't remembering too much at the time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Daily was, without question, a linchpin in efforts to preserve and honor the memory of the Seventh Cavalry and served as its president in the early 1990's. In 1993, he attended a peace ceremony in South Dakota with members of the Lakota Sioux tribe to help make amends for the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee by the Seventh Cavalry.</p>
        <p>''Daily has this thing about apologizing,'' says David Hughes, 72, of Colorado Springs, a former Seventh Cavalry officer who believes The Associated Press exaggerated what might have occurred at No Gun Ri.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daily passed up at least one opportunity to confess his role in No Gun Ri before The A.P. interviewed him.</p>
        <p>For more than a decade, he spent two hours in group therapy every two weeks at the Veterans Administration hospital in Nashville, said David Shepard, a clinical pharmacist who helped run the sessions. Mr. Daily continues to receive disability payments from the V.A. for neurosis.</p>
        <p>''He was a good member -- very supportive, very verbal. He talks, which is good,'' Mr. Shepard said.</p>
        <p>Not once did Mr. Daily mention a massacre. Still, Mr. Shepard said he was ''shocked'' when allegations surfaced this month that Mr. Daily's war record was embellished.</p>
        <p>''He's the rock of the earth, in my opinion,'' Mr. Shepard said. ''I never saw him to be someone who would stretch the truth.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Daily went on the road to help other veterans who suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome. In the fall of 1998, James Kerns, 70, a former sergeant in Piedmont, S.C., said Mr. Daily invited him to a workshop in Columbia, where Mr. Daily opened the session by talking about the affliction.</p>
        <p>At the time, Mr. Kerns said, he had not yet been contacted by The Associated Press, but its reporters had begun asking others, including Mr. Daily, about No Gun Ri. While at the workshop, Mr. Kerns said, Mr. Daily asked him about the massacre.</p>
        <p>''He told me he had orders, but it wasn't the same order I had,'' Mr. Kerns said. Mr. Kerns then told The Associated Press that he was instructed to hold the civilians in place to protect the regiment's position, and that any firing was aimed over their heads.</p>
        <p>Also in 1998, Mr. Tinkler, the machine-gunner, said, Mr. Daily brought up No Gun Ri in their conversations as well. ''He asked if I remembered who did the shooting, and I said yes, I was the one. And he said, who gave the orders, and I said there was no one gave the orders,'' Mr. Tinkler said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tinkler confirmed his quotes in the Associated Press article -- that he shot at the civilians on his own accord, fearful that they were shielding enemy soldiers. Mr. Tinkler now says he could not be sure who called him first, Mr. Daily or The Associated Press. Mr. Hanley of The A.P. said he was convinced that reporters at the news group contacted him first.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daily confirmed speaking with fellow veterans about No Gun Ri but said that, for the most part, they called him to ask about the Associated Press's investigation.</p>
        <p>Today, eyewitness accounts are all the Army has in its effort to verify the Associated Press account. As many as 12 investigators at the National Archives and Records Administration in College Park, Md., have been sifting through thousands of paper-filled gray file boxes since last fall; a new batch arrives in their room, 24 boxes to the cart, several times a day. Thus far, people familiar with the Army investigation said, no paper trail has surfaced.</p>
        <p>That leaves the veterans. The officer who is said to have given the orders is dead.</p>
        <p>Some veterans who might have carried them out cannot be found. Others are reluctant to talk. Mr. Tinkler recently received a letter from the Army asking him to meet with its investigators. ''What will I tell them? Not damn much.''</p>
        <p>Defending a Confession  Veterans Roiled, A Time to Move On</p>
        <p>Mr. Daily declined to address the question of why he would confess to a massacre he did not commit.</p>
        <p>Richard Burns, a Vietnam veteran, was a consultant on ''Stolen Valor: How the Vietnam Generation Was Robbed of Its Heroes and Its History,'' (Verity Press, 1998) an expose of soldiers who exaggerated their war records. He said it has become more common in recent years for ex-soldiers to falsely claim dishonor.</p>
        <p>''They do that because there is a movement in this country, the victim-hero thing. 'People will feel sorry for me that I killed children and women, and they will understand me,' '' Mr. Burns said.</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Daily may have been undone by a one-time admirer. Robert Bateman, a teacher at West Point, commanded the modern-day Seventh Cavalry Regiment in Texas in the mid-1990's when Mr. Daily came to visit. Mr. Bateman had him sign his regiment flag, called a guidon. Mr. Daily sent him Christmas cards.</p>
        <p>But within days of the Associated Press article, Mr. Bateman, his suspicions aroused, filed the first Freedom of Information Act request for Mr. Daily's personnel records, according to archive records. Within weeks, The A.P. and other news groups were filing their own.</p>
        <p>They received a one-page synopsis showing Mr. Daily was not with the Seventh Regiment at No Gun Ri. It took several more months for this information to emerge this spring in news accounts.</p>
        <p>For a time, Mr. Daily called on his veteran friends to try to convince them he was for real. Mr. Hesselman met him in November at the Skyline Chili restaurant in Erlanger, Ky., where, he said, Mr. Daily opened a folder.</p>
        <p>''He had some proof he was promoted to first lieutenant, with a battlefield commission,'' Mr. Hesselman said. ''He showed me a copy of the order. I'm going by what he showed me.</p>
        <p>''Maybe I put too much faith in what he's telling me,'' he added. ''I don't know.''</p>
        <p>Some Seventh Cavalry veterans remain bitter about Mr. Daily's efforts. ''He deflowered our moment in time with a horrible story,'' Mr. De Borde said.</p>
        <p>Other friends think Mr. Daily should simply move on.</p>
        <p>''Ed likes the limelight, he always did,'' said his friend Mr. Down. ''But I'd say to him now, 'Ed, you've had your run. It's time for you to get an old hound dog or two and sit on the porch and relax like everyone else.' ''</p>
        <p>Outside his home, standing beneath a 200-year-old maple tree, Mr. Daily said he was inclined to take that advice. He said he was sleeping very little. His phone rang so much he disconnected it. He turned down an invitation to speak to veterans at a Memorial Day ceremony.</p>
        <p>''I'm done. I'll never write again,'' he said. ''I've lost my dedication. It's dog-eat-dog out there, and I'm mentally drained.''</p>
