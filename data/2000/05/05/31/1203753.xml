        <p>With a heavily padded sneaker protecting the sore tendon in his right foot, Patrick Ewing shot his requisite number of free throws today, barely perspired and afterward proclaimed, ''I'm fine.''</p>
        <p>While Ewing did not declare himself ready for Wednesday's Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals, he told a teammate before practice that he expected to play at Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.</p>
        <p>The mere suggestion that Ewing is returning to the lineup after the Knicks knotted the series at two games apiece brought all the old Ewing questions to bear, including the most prominent one: With their franchise center soothing his own health concerns, are the wounded yet recharged Knicks also fine?</p>
        <p>''I'm done doing that,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said, bristling at the idea that Ewing's return might tinker with his team's on-court chemistry. ''Let the foolish remain foolish. I'm not even trying to educate them.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks are 5-1 against Indiana in complete postseason games without Ewing the past two years. If Latrell Sprewell, Allan Houston and Marcus Camby re-energized the Knicks with their offense in Ewing's absence a year ago, Larry Johnson has picked up the pace in Games 2, 3 and 4 of this playoff series.</p>
        <p>Johnson is shooting 59 percent from the field in the past three games, having hit 26 of 44 field goals and all five 3-point attempts in Monday's stirring Game 4 victory at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>''I have to take advantage of my opportunities when I can when the Big Fella is playing,'' Johnson said today. ''When the Big Fella is not playing, we have to have some low-post presence. That's why I was able to move down there, get some good looks, good touches. They really weren't doubling as much.</p>
        <p>''But I don't feel like some Pacer killer,'' he added. ''We beat these cats without him last year, but he doesn't bring us down. I think he helps. With him, I think it would be easier.''</p>
        <p>Ewing has not played since the first quarter of Game 2, when acute peroneal tendinitis forced him to the bench. Without him, the Knicks have averaged 94.5 points in the past two games, using their transition game to combat a slow-footed and stupefied Indiana team.</p>
        <p>How the injury will affect Ewing's play is up for debate. Ewing has said he is having trouble cutting and planting the injured foot. He has struggled with his lateral movement all season, trying to keep up with younger, quicker big men.</p>
        <p>Rik Smits does not present those type of problems, but the 7-foot-4-inch Pacers center is determined to erase the memory of his last six quarters against the Knicks, in which he has scored only 18 points and has become almost a forgotten option in Indiana's offense.</p>
        <p>Ewing is not the only Knick still battling an injury. Camby's sprained knee, suffered in Game 3, has improved enough for the Knicks reserve forward to play extended minutes in Game 5. Sprewell said the slight fracture in his left foot will not hamper his play.</p>
        <p>Ewing is the only Knick who has missed games, and how soon he recaptures his rhythm may mean the difference between a successful night or a struggling return.</p>
        <p>''We're hopeful for the best,'' Van Gundy said. ''He has been off for seven or eight days, so that is a concern.''</p>
        <p>Asked if that would curb Ewing's playing time if he played, Van Gundy replied, ''I'll just see how the game is going.''</p>
        <p>In many ways, the Knicks traveled to Indianapolis in much the same fashion they did a year ago. A 2-2 series. Reduced expectations swirling about because of their health issues.</p>
        <p>Banged up and relying more on their resolve than their talent, they shocked the Pacers and went on to win the series in six games.</p>
        <p>You wonder how long those qualities can carry them this postseason.</p>
        <p>''Even when things are inflicted upon us, or we inflict them upon ourselves, we have great resiliency,'' Van Gundy said.</p>
        <p>''But you know what the danger is? Everybody is stroking them today about 'Gritty, determined, bounce back.' And subconsciously, if they're content with just getting even, and they buy into all that hype, like the Little Engine That Could type of thing . . .</p>
        <p>''My first point to them today was, you can't be content with just getting even. Everyone is going to give us every excuse for losing. And the only people who buy into excuses are losers. So we have to put all that aside and find a way. Getting even was the first step. Now we have to find a way to win a game on the road.''</p>
        <p>With or without Ewing, that may be the most grueling task. The Knicks have yet to win at Conseco since it opened this season.</p>
        <p>Asked if the Knicks need Ewing to win the series, Houston said: ''I don't know. I can't answer that question because he hasn't been there. We won two games at home. If he had been there and we won those games, nobody would have said anything.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''If we win the championship, Patrick has to be there.''</p>
