        <p>IN the decades since it was banned, absinthe, a spirit flavored with anise and wormwood, has been inflated with tremendous allure. It was said to make people wickedly drunk and to unleash the creativity in their souls. It was hedonism distilled into a liqueur the color of a pea leaf.</p>
        <p>Absinthe was also supposed to be hallucinogenic and was blamed for causing insanity, which is why it was banned in most of Western Europe and the United States. Then in 1998, a group of curious Londoners uncovered a surprising detail: absinthe had never been legally banned in Britain. They soon began importing it. It was an instant hit among the young bar crowd.</p>
        <p>Until I went to London last week, it was still legend for me. I went to soak up the absinthe scene, which, as it turned out, was already fading. But I wondered, What is absinthe really like, this spirit that mesmerized Rimbaud, Verlaine, van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec? Oscar Wilde described drinking absinthe this way: ''After the first glass, you see things as you wish they were. After the second, you see things as they are not. Finally you see things as they really are, and that is the most horrible thing in the world.''</p>
        <p>I started at Pharmacy in Notting Hill, one of the first bars to carry absinthe. I went at 6, post-work, pre-dinner, l'heure verte, the green hour as it was called a century ago, when Parisians could be found at cafes smoking, staring, sipping absinthe.</p>
        <p>Alas, the tradition was lost. The place was empty, save for a man hunched over a newspaper and a beer. When I ordered, the bartender raised his brow. ''You know it's very strong, right?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>He gave me a small taste of it straight. I swirled the liquid, green as mouthwash, in the glass. It shimmered in a soft eddy. I had intended to taste it like wine, breathing it in and letting it sit and roll around my mouth. But somehow, it shot down my throat like a bullet. I recall it went something like this: first, there was a scream of anise and herbs, then what felt like a steaming hot cotton swab spread over my tongue, and a flash of heat raced to my stomach. My tongue was numb, and within a minute my limbs were leaden.</p>
        <p>Was it the power of a legend, or just that of a spirit that's 140 proof?</p>
        <p>The bartender then made the traditional drink, a measured procedure that looks a lot like a drug ritual. He poured a finger of the spirit into a tumbler, then dipped a spoon with a sugar cube into it until it was soaked. He lighted the spoon, making a great blue flame. He let it burn over the glass, then swirled the bubbling sugar into the absinthe and topped it with water, stirring it into a pale green, milky liquid.</p>
        <p>This was tamer, creamier and softer, like pastis, but much sweeter. I became numb from my eyebrows down.</p>
        <p>I moved on to a few more bars, including Woody's, a new bar in northwest London with tall vermilion banquettes, moss green walls and an enormous glossy Mario Testino photo of people standing around in their underwear. There, I was told I could have absinthe the traditional way, but that very few people ordered it like that. Puzzled, I ordered one of the house's absinthe cocktails, a Dragon's Breath, made with cherry liqueur, vodka and lime juice.</p>
        <p>It came in a shot glass with a frosty liquid on the bottom and a viscous layer of pale green absinthe on top. Where the two met, they curdled. If it did that in the glass, what would happen once it hit my stomach? Unfortunately, I can tell you: it was like drinking tomato sauce after eating ice cream.</p>
        <p>No one else had ordered absinthe that night, which was a good thing since I got the last shot that was left. They had run out of it over the weekend, Tony Rweyemamu, the bartender, told me. That's when people drink it, he said, usually a quick shot between beers or other mixed drinks, to speed up the lubrication process.</p>
        <p>Jans Ende, a bartender at the Met, a private club, said he wasn't serving it as much anymore. ''It's not that good,'' he said. ''It's not the legend that absinthe was.''</p>
        <p>Unless you happen upon a bottle that has been preserved, it is impossible to know exactly how it is different, or even whether it was good in its day. Before the general ban early in the 20th century, absinthe had been produced for more than a century. As Barnaby Conrad III states in ''Absinthe: History in a Bottle'' (Chronicle, 1988), it was created in Switzerland and originally issued as a tonic for French soldiers to fight fevers. It was so popular that it became an everyday drink for soldiers and civilians. Which isn't to say that it was good, but it was cheap -- as cheap as wine, at least, and with much more bang for the franc.</p>
        <p>Early in the 20th century, though, absinthe became the scapegoat for many social problems. The French government's anti-absinthe campaign included claims that it caused impotence. When people died of syphilis, doctors would name absinthe abuse as the cause of death to save them the embarrassment of the illness.</p>
        <p>Switzerland, Belgium and the United States were the first to ban absinthe. Eventually, the French government prohibited absinthe in 1914, and the Pernod company developed pastis to replace it. Pastis was still flavored with anise but not wormwood, but it is much different from absinthe in subtle but significant ways. Its alcohol content is much lower, and it has a less complex flavor. It can't be substituted for absinthe in cocktails. Its greatest similarity, really, is that it is affordable, as absinthe once was.</p>
        <p>Today's absinthe, however, is the wealthy urbanite's drink. Classic absinthe, with sugar and water, averages $9; cocktails cost more. When I ordered it at Three Three Three in Shoreditch, where many young artists live, the bartender made sure I knew it was expensive before she poured.</p>
        <p>As it turns out, the price is partly intentional, partly unavoidable. In Britain, import taxes are based on alcohol content, absinthe's primary component. And Green Bohemia, the first distributor of absinthe, had the marketing tactics of Absolut Vodka in mind. The distributor wanted it to be expensive and difficult to get, as Absolut was early on, knowing that the difficulty would make Londoners want it even more.</p>
        <p>The idea to import absinthe began with an article in an underground literary magazine called The Idler: Those Who Live to Loaf. The writer, John Moore, is a musician whose band, Black Box Recorder, was traveling through Eastern Europe, where absinthe is legal. The two men behind The Idler, Gavin Pretor-Pinney and Tom Hodgkinson, were intrigued. ''We, like most people, had sort of heard of this drink, that it was this kind of naughty drink,'' Mr. Pretor-Pinney said.</p>
        <p>Over several meetings with Mr. Moore in a pub, they explored the idea of importing it. After many letters to agencies dealing with health and with agriculture and fisheries, they confirmed that it was, in fact, legal. They sought out an importer of spirits in the Czech Republic, where absinthe has always been available, and they formed an alliance with Hill's Absinthe.</p>
        <p>They called the new importing company Green Bohemia and introduced absinthe in Britain in November 1998. In less than a year, it took London by storm, beginning in Soho bars, then spreading to private clubs and bars throughout the city. Now, even the staid, formal Library Bar in the Lanesborough Hotel serves it, and so do many ordinary pubs.</p>
        <p>Green Bohemia is run out of The Idler office, a loft in Clerkenwell strewn with music magazines, coffee cups, skateboards and computer equipment. Mr. Pretor-Pinney and Mr. Hodgkinson said that selling absinthe is a kind of pleasant distraction for them. They try to promote it as an artists' drink but realize that it has taken on a life of its own.</p>
        <p>There are now more than eight brands, all made in Europe, from Spain to Bulgaria. Some are sweeter than others, but all contain scant amounts of wormwood, the ingredient responsible for absinthe's supposed hallucinogenic effects. Even the original had very little, and modern studies have concluded that whatever extreme effects people had from absinthe were most likely caused by the high alcohol content, not the wormwood. Today, the European Union limits thujone, the drug in wormwood, to 10 milligrams a kilogram of the spirit.</p>
        <p>The flavor of Hill's is the most austere, resembling vodka, with a milder licorice flavor. Salvatore Calabrese, the bar manager at the Library Bar, has tasted an old bottle of the original, and he said Hill's is the closest in flavor.</p>
        <p>It makes sense. Hill's tends toward the bitter more than the sweet, which is why the ritual of adding sugar to the drink evolved. Many of the other absinthes are so sweet that by the time the sugar is added, it is like drinking syrup.</p>
        <p>Making my way around London in search of the absinthe scene was like chasing an elusive criminal. It was easy to find people who had drunk absinthe but difficult to find anyone drinking it. Ben Hoyle, Nick Chapman and Sebastian Boyd, all young professionals in jeans and sneakers, were at the Bluu Cafe on Hoxton Square having beers.</p>
        <p>''The first flush of novelty has definitely gone out,'' Mr. Chapman said. It has been around for a whole year and a half.</p>
        <p>But they knew absinthe and all of its effects, having drunk it often during the last year. ''It's a really good laugh,'' said Mr. Hoyle, a management consultant. ''But it has a kind of depth-charge effect, because after two or three, you don't think it's working, then later, one and a half hours after, you feel it.''</p>
        <p>None of them have hallucinated, but it has made them, they said, do things out of the ordinary. Mr. Hoyle, who rarely dances, danced salsa for three hours straight after an absinthe binge. One took a chicken from the refrigerator and beat it with a hammer. Another set a table on fire.</p>
        <p>They don't drink it to savor it. ''It gets the job done,'' said Mr. Boyd, a journalist. And they try not to drink it during the week. ''They were obviously more hard core in the 19th century,'' Mr. Hoyle added, ''Now we have jobs to go to.''</p>
        <p>I also stopped in at the Long Bar in the Sanderson Hotel, a more self-conscious scene in a new hotel designed by Ian Schrager. They didn't have absinthe, as it turned out. ''I don't want people burning things at the bar,'' said Ben Pundole, the bars executive for Mr. Schrager's hotels. ''It's a classic bar.'' When Mr. Pundole was the bar manager at the Met, he made sure that it was one of the first to have absinthe  on its shelf.</p>
        <p>More unfortunate, though, was the emerging truth that after all these years, absinthe was being reduced to a fad.</p>
        <p>I still hadn't had enough to feel its effects, other than a numb tongue. It was time. At Alphabet in Soho, I ordered three classic absinthes and drank them within half an hour. Then -- clearly the absinthe was working -- I decided to have a beer. At first, the back of my head felt as if it would burn off, then the heat descended to the ends of my limbs, making them feel as heavy as if I had just gone swimming in a denim suit. I had no desire to beat a chicken. I did not see green fairies. But I was breathlessly drunk. The next morning had that familiar haze.</p>
        <p>So much for the romance. It's no wonder the fashionable crowd has turned its back on absinthe. The genie is out of the bottle, and no one wants to think of van Gogh lying in bed with the spins.</p>
