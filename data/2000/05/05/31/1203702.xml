        <p>The secretary of agriculture had just begun to speak at the opening session of the National Nutrition Summit here today when an animal rights protester leaped onto the stage and threw a pie at him.</p>
        <p>The protester's message was loud and clear: ''Shame on you, Dan Glickman, you meathead. Shame on you for promoting meat.'' But her aim was off. Mr. Glickman ducked, and the pie -- either apple or tofu cream, depending on who was asked -- grazed the back of his jacket.</p>

        <p>The secretary of agriculture had just begun to speak at the opening session of the National Nutrition Summit here today when an animal rights protester leaped onto the stage and threw a pie at him.</p>
        <p>The protester's message was loud and clear: ''Shame on you, Dan Glickman, you meathead. Shame on you for promoting meat.'' But her aim was off. Mr. Glickman ducked, and the pie -- either apple or tofu cream, depending on who was asked -- grazed the back of his jacket.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Glickman, a former House member from Kansas, peeled off his jacket, he didn't miss a beat: ''That was not a very balanced meal she threw at me.'' Then he turned to former Senator Bob Dole, who was also on the stage, and said, ''Bob, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Glickman was one of the speakers at the meeting, convened 31 years after the original White House Conference on Food Nutrition and Health, which was instrumental in starting many of the government food assistance programs like Head Start and the school breakfast program.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Glickman announced that the government had decided to test two of the nation's most popular diets -- low carbohydrate and low fat -- to see which is more effective and safer. Millions of Americans have tried one of the diets or a variation, including the high-protein, low-carbohydrate regimen developed by the cardiologist Robert Atkins and  the low-fat diet promoted by Dean Ornish.</p>
        <p>The pie thrower, Arathi Jayaram, 24, who lives in northern Virginia, is a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. She was carried out by a member of Mr. Glickman's security team.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jayaram was charged with assault of a cabinet official. The charge carries a recommended penalty of up to a year in jail, but there is no category in federal sentencing guidelines for assault with a pie in a disposable aluminum tin.</p>
