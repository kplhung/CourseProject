        <p>''We were just trying to propose our own souls to ourselves,'' the poet Allen Ginsberg once said. ''We were trying to find truth and meaning in life,'' said Jack Kerouac.</p>
        <p>These explanations of purpose seem so innocent now, so unironic. (Isn't that refreshing?) As young men in the 1940's and 50's, the group of writers called the Beats helped set the stage for the 60's counterculture with what Kerouac called their ''secret naked doodlings'' and ''secret scatological thoughts.''</p>
        <p>An ''American Masters'' documentary by the filmmaker Chuck Workman has admirably captured these personalities, as well as their uninhibited willingness to push an idea or a metaphor or a sentence to the limit. ''The Source: The Story of the Beats and the Beat Generation,''  tonight at 9:30 on PBS, mesmerizes with its protean visual style and dynamic score (which includes Dizzy Gillespie, the Doors, and Philip Glass's riveting ''Metamorphosis,'' performed as a tribute to Ginsberg, before the poet's death in 1997). It is also moving and funny and smart.</p>
        <p>Mr. Workman hypothesizes that the Beats were instrumental in breaking down cultural and political taboos, and that their influence lingers. Fair enough. Individual expression has become almost obligatory; Buddhism has been embraced by New Age thought; the poetry coffeehouse lives in the East Village and on the Internet. Ginsberg even appeared in a Gap ad. Still, the sections on the 60's and beyond are less energetic than those chronicling the early years, maybe because the iconoclasts had become respectable.</p>
        <p>A pulsing stream of images and ideas captures the deeply ambivalent character of the 1950's. The public face of the era was represented by satisfied conformity: Ozzie and Harriet, tract houses, drive-ins, television and President Eisenhower. But there was another world where everyone else lived: blacks, gays, potheads, Lenny Bruce and people who liked Charlie Parker and may even have been curious about John Cage.</p>
        <p>The prospect of this alternate universe drew Jack Kerouac, a hunk football player, to New York from Lowell, Mass., in 1944 to become a writer. It brought William S. Burroughs, the product of a proper St. Louis family who would become an addict and an exile (after accidentally killing his wife during a drunken ''William Tell'' re-enactment). Ginsberg grew up nearby, in Paterson, N.J., but his outsider credentials were solid: gay and a poet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Workman interviewed or collected interviews with Ginsberg, Kerouac, Burroughs, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Gregory Corso and other known or once-known or almost-known writers. We see that they were nakedly in love with their own ideas and observations, with the notion of coming to grips with their own reality. No one else's reality mattered to them after Hiroshima. ''There was suddenly the realization: 'Why are we being intimidated by a bunch of jerks who don't know anything about life?' '' said Ginsberg. '' 'Who are they to tell us what we feel and how we're supposed to behave?' ''</p>
        <p>Drugs and drink were crucial to this group's creativity and to that of their literary heirs, or so they believed. We see Burroughs, who describes himself as ''sort of a WASP washout,'' shooting up. Elsewhere, Ken Kesey says, ''I could never have written 'Cuckoo's Nest' without LSD.''</p>
        <p>As young men, they were giddily narcissistic but apparently unconcerned with celebrity (difficult, now, to imagine a group of writers in New York like that). Kerouac wrote 14 books before he was published. They kept busy writing, partying, talking, and filming themselves and each other. We are shown clips from ''Pull My Daisy,'' a movie written by Kerouac and starring his friends, a Beat curiosity. (It will be shown in its 27-minute entirety on Channel 13 on July 14 as part of the ''Reel New York'' independent film series).</p>
        <p>John Turturro, Dennis Hopper and Johnny Depp give individual readings from Ginsberg, Burroughs and Kerouac. Norman Mailer offers up a Beat-influenced poem he wrote for Ginsberg. Brief, vulgar and poignant, it's not much of a poem, but it is a perfect example of the documentary's idiosyncratic heart.</p>
