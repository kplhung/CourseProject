        <p>Levy Tried to Hire Ex-Chancellor</p>
        <p>HAROLD O. LEVY, the New York City schools chancellor, who has taken some grief for his lack of education credentials, tried to recruit a nationally admired educator, ANTHONY J. ALVARADO, left, to join his administration. Mr. Alvarado was the New York City schools chancellor from 1983 to 1984 before resigning because of irregularities in his personal finances.</p>
        <p>He is best known for his policies as a superintendent in East Harlem's District 4, where he started many small and experimental schools, and in District 2, from Chinatown to the Upper East Side, where reading scores rose steadily and middle-class families flocked to once-lackluster public schools as they improved under his leadership.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy confirmed that he had explored the idea of hiring Mr. Alvarado in mid-April but that it had not worked out. He declined to say why.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alvarado, who is now in charge of instruction in San Diego public schools, did not return a telephone request for comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>New Job for Ex-City College President</p>
        <p>YOLANDA T. MOSES, who was forced to resign as president of the City College of New York last summer, has a new job lined up. This summer, she will become president of the American Association for Higher Education in Washington, replacing MARGARET A. MILLER. Dr. Moses said she hopes to help the association focus on the next generation of projects, including one to study how technology can be used to improve teaching and learning. For the past year, she has split her time among California, Washington and New York,  studying race and higher education and women as college presidents and catching up on anthropology, her academic field.</p>
        <p>N.Y.U. Unit Named for Tisch</p>
        <p>New York University is naming its Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Travel Administration after PRESTON ROBERT TISCH, left, a man who knows something about hotels. He invested in his first hotel, Laurel in the Pines, along with his parents and his brother Laurence, in 1946. That became Tisch Hotels and then Loews Hotels and then the Loews Corporation, a conglomerate with more than $70 billion in assets, including 17 hotels.</p>
        <p>Along the way, Mr. Tisch maintained an interest in hotels and tourism as chairman of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau and founding chairman of the New York City Convention and Exhibition Center Corporation. Although not an N.Y.U. graduate, 16 years ago he joined the  board of trustees, then headed by his brother LAURENCE A. TISCH, who is an N.Y.U. graduate.</p>
        <p>The eight-year-old hospitality program, which has 500 students and is part of N.Y.U.'s School of Continuing and Professional Studies, will share part of a recent $25 million gift by the Tisches and will now have Bob Tisch's name as well. ''They've been after me for a year to name the center,'' Bob Tisch said, ''and I kept turning them down because I felt there were enough Tisch names around the university. But I finally gave in.''</p>
        <p>Engineering Dean at Manhattan College</p>
        <p>DR. RICHARD HEIST has been appointed the new dean of the School of Engineering at Manhattan College. Dr. Heist comes from the University of Rochester, where he was the associate dean for graduate studies in the Schools of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Applied Sciences.</p>
        <p>Trustee Appointed to Fashion Institute</p>
        <p>The New York City Board of Education has appointed its Queens representative, TERRI THOMSON, to the board of trustees of the Fashion Institute of Technology. The Board of Education chooses half of the institute's 10 trustees.</p>
        <p>Ramapo College Gets Interim President</p>
        <p>DR. ALICE CHANDLER, a former president of the State University of New York at New Paltz, has been appointed the interim president of Ramapo College of New Jersey in Mahwah. Dr. Chandler had at one time been an acting president for the City College of New York.</p>
