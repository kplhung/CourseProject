        <p>Larry Bird was laughing.</p>
        <p>His Indiana Pacers had just lost two games on the road to a MASH unit eager to keep struggling on. After the 91-89 defeat in Madison Square Garden Monday night, Jalen Rose and the reserve guard Travis Best said the Pacers were too slow and their offense too predictable against a Knicks team revitalized by injury and adversity. They implied that Bird should make some changes.</p>
        <p>''It's no different from when I played,'' Bird said today. ''Every time we lost, it was never my fault, it's the coach's fault. I understand that, I'll take the heat, but I do expect them to come out tomorrow night and play.''</p>
        <p>Bird challenged his players to be tougher in Wednesday night's  Game 5, especially where they have wilted this season -- in the first quarter. He urged them to defend and to rebound, calling the 7-foot-4-inch center Rik Smits's one-rebound effort in Game 4 ''a killer.'' And that was when Knicks center Patrick Ewing was on the bench in a suit, sidelined for the second straight game by tendinitis in his left foot.</p>
        <p>Without Ewing's presence in the paint, the Knicks have been more spontaneous, setting the pace and outscoring Indiana, 45-22, in fast-break points this series. Bird admitted his team lacked speed, but said his players could compensate by being in the right spot.</p>
        <p>''I look and see Reggie and Jalen running out,'' Bird said. ''They got to be in the paint there to pick up some loose rebounds.''</p>
        <p>Reggie Miller may have had a team-high 24 points in Game 4, but he had no rebounds. ''If they don't, we don't have a chance to win,'' Bird said. ''And that's what I talked to these guys about. Give yourself an opportunity to win by getting on the boards.''</p>
        <p>Contrary to Rose's comments, Bird believed the plays were not the problem, but rather his players' lack of crisp execution. ''Obviously Jalen thinks we should just give him the ball, clear out and let him go one on one,'' Bird said, laughing. ''We have 50, 60 different plays. I'm a firm believer you need about 10, and you need to run them great every time you run them. There can't be any flaws in them. If we do things by the numbers, we'll score points.''</p>
        <p>Rose, averaging a team-high 21.3 points in this series, reiterated that the formula makes the Pacers too predictable.</p>
        <p>''The plays we run are pretty much the plays we've been running Larry Bird's entire coaching career,'' he said, but then he agreed with Bird. ''On the offensive end, we need to find a way to get easy baskets. But by all accounts, guys just need to play.''</p>
        <p>Rose added, ''I don't think there is any reason for us to lose confidence, to be tentative or to panic at this point.''</p>
        <p>Having squandered a 2-0 lead, the Pacers say they are not panicking, but they are sweating. Miller, averaging 20.3 points a game this series, vowed to become more aggressive on offense, then said, ''The pressure is back on us because we have to win tomorrow on our home court to shift the pressure back to them in Game 6.''</p>
        <p>Bird put pressure on the bench, which was missing in action in the last game especially. Since his breakout performance of 22 points in Game 1, Austin Croshere has scored just 12 points, and has been dismal from 3-point range. Best offers more speed at point guard, and scored 12 Monday, but he has been inconsistent in the series. Sam Perkins had no points in Game 4.</p>
        <p>The Pacers are not hitting from the perimeter as they did in the first two victories. But the Knicks are shooting better without Ewing, making an unconscious 10 for 14 on 3-pointers, for 71.4 percent, Monday night, as the Pacers were 8 of 19 for 42.1 percent.</p>
        <p>''Mentally, they're tougher than anyone you want to meet, and if you beat them at their best, you feel good about it,'' Bird said.</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>REGGIE MILLER fumed after Game 2 when he saw Knicks fans, including the movie director SPIKE LEE, sitting in the second row from the court at Conseco Fieldhouse. Tuesday, JALEN ROSE joined Miller. ''They sit closer than my mother sits,'' he said. ''They buy them just like I'm buying them. They might as well sell them to me.'' Season ticket-holders can choose to sell them to ticket brokers if they do not use them. The Pacers' co-owners, MELVIN and HERB SIMON, listened to Miller and Rose. They said they would buy any courtside tickets that season ticket-holders were planning to sell for Game 5, will match the price offered by brokers, and donate the seats to youngsters.</p>
