        <p>Ten students from across the country gathered as finalists in the National Geography Bee on a Washington stage last week, standing alongside Alex Trebek, the ''Jeopardy!'' host, and waving at their parents beaming in the audience.</p>
        <p>Only one could name two of the three largest sections of Denmark (Jutland, Sjaelland and Fyn). But all shared one notable trait, the same shared by all but two finalists in the 12-year history of the contest.</p>
        <p>And the answer is? They were all boys.</p>
        <p>For a decade, educators have bemoaned that a large percentage of Americans cannot locate their own country on a map, much less point the way to Irkutsk. Geography slipped off school curriculums, derided as too dependent on rote learning, as educators blended it into broader social studies classes. Students who learned it tended to do so at home or on their own time.</p>
        <p>But the efforts to emphasize the importance of the subject over the last few years have highlighted a new problem. With students left to their own devices, a geography gender gap has become evident, so wide that with five million students participating in the bee, about 77 percent of the school winners are boys. The bee asks participants to identify geographic sites and characteristics, knowledge that is believed best mastered by a familiarity with maps.</p>
        <p>Researchers and educators have bounced back and forth over the last few years debating whom schools shortchange more: boys (in reading) or girls (in math and science). But with so much attention focused on the disparities, they have begun to fade.</p>
        <p>Why the geography gap endures, some researchers say, has something to do with the fact that most schools are still not teaching the subject, and something to do with the toys geared toward boys and other social influences.</p>
        <p>But mostly, they say, the gap stems from cognitive differences that give boys better spatial skills than girls. The same advantages that help boys in the geography bee make them, in general, better at finding their way. And that, they add, just might explain why men so stubbornly -- some would say determinedly -- refuse to ask for directions.</p>
        <p>''There are significant sex differences in levels of spatial skills in participation in geography-related activities like atlas use and navigation, and in the degree of liking geography,'' said Lynn S. Liben, distinguished professor of psychology at Pennsylvania State University, a co-author of a study the National Geographic Society commissioned on why girls do not do as well on the bee.</p>
        <p>''I feel I have to say this as a woman,'' she said, ''that it's not true that every woman is worse than every man or every girl is worse than every boy. But at the group level, it is true. If you have to bet money, bet the man.''</p>
        <p>The Geographic Society started the geography bee a decade ago out of concern that Americans did not know anything about the subject. A Gallup survey in 1988 found that 20 percent of Americans 18 to 24 years old could not find the United States on a map without labels. American students performed the worst among students of 10 nations when asked to identify regions of the world.</p>
        <p>The problem began, geographers and educators say, in the 1950's, when schools began absorbing geography and history into one course: social studies. This was seen as a way to get students thinking about the broad picture, to analyze rather than just memorize facts.</p>
        <p>After the surveys, the Geographic Society began arguing that understanding geography is key to understanding other subjects -- the history of wars, the development of cities and regions. Congress agreed, declaring a National Geography Awareness Week.</p>
        <p>The Geographic Society distributed atlases and handbooks on how to teach geography to every public, private and parochial school in the country. In recent years, several companies have developed computer games to emphasize geography.</p>
        <p>These efforts seem to be paying off in some small ways: an overwhelming proportion of students rate geography as the least or second-least favorite subject, but the fraction of those who say it is their favorite has risen to 14 percent, from 8 percent in 1983; 74 percent of American teachers have taken a college course in geography, up from 59 percent in 1983.</p>
        <p>Still, teaching of geography is haphazard, and most students who learn it study it out of interest, not because a teacher asks them to. Notably, 4 out of 10 finalists in this year's bee were schooled at home. The year's winner, 13-year-old Felix Peng from Guilford, Conn., learned at home as a toddler, as his father would point to Taiwan, his birthplace, then spin the globe and have Felix find it again. As Felix grew, his father added more and more countries to the game.</p>
        <p>By 1996, the Geographic Society had a new concern. Worried about the dearth of girls not just in the finals but in the entrance round of the contests in schools, it commissioned a study by Professor Liben and Roger M. Downs, a geography professor, also at Pennsylvania State. The society was worried that it might be asking questions in a way that was biased against girls.</p>
        <p>The researchers found that was not the case. Rather, they said, the gap results from a combination of factors, the most significant being the difference in spatial skills between boys and girls. Research on cognition, Professor Liben said, shows that boys tend to have higher mental rotation skills, allowing them to better imagine what things look like reversed or upside down. This helps them interpret maps -- as well as the diagrams that accompany allegedly easy-to-assemble furniture.</p>
        <p>Steven Young, a finalist from Reston, Va., learned by studying a map on a shower curtain, requiring him to recognize his Mozambiques and Madagascars backward.</p>
        <p>Women turn the maps and diagrams around to figure out where they are, Professor Liben said, or simply ask for directions, while men will struggle through the mental rotation. (''Whether you view that as a negative or positive, as you're stubborn or trying to be macho, depends on whether you're a man or a woman,'' she adds.)</p>
        <p>This cognitive difference, though, was magnified by social factors, the researchers said. Boys, for instance, tend to play with blocks and mechanical toys.</p>
        <p>And teachers notice what the study said: that girls simply do not gravitate toward maps and geography.</p>
        <p>In Guilford, Felix's teacher, Louis Russo, started a before-school geography club. No girls showed up. ''I always encourage the girls to get involved; I don't want them to think it's an all-male situation,'' he said. ''But they just don't pick up on it.''</p>
        <p>The interest starts young. ''The boys just seem to naturally take to it,'' said Howard S. Becker, a social studies teacher in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., and a coordinator of the state's geography bee. ''Whenever I ask them, 'How long have you been doing this?' they say, 'Since I was 3 or 4, I've always had an interest in looking at atlases and maps.' I've never seen one girl who says that.''</p>
        <p>Girls are more likely to end up on the honor roll or do well in school, teachers say. But unless the school or the teacher focuses explicitly on geography, they are not likely to become interested in it.</p>
        <p>''The girls at this stage are much more interested in the big picture; they tend to explore areas that don't lend themselves to this much detail,'' said Linda Ague, the librarian at the Cal Young Middle School in Eugene, Ore., who coached Alex King, 13, to the finals last week. ''Geography tends to be get blended into a block curriculum; we don't have a geography textbook in the whole building. For kids who think in that generalized, big picture way, the geography stays just a piece of it. The boys tend to gravitate to the detail, to the map part of it.''</p>
        <p>This year, the two girls in the semifinals were from Puerto Rico and Vermont. Jessie Friend, the entrant from Barton, Vt., says her secret is reading, especially newspapers, and looking up any place she doesn't know. ''I like to find out about things that are happening and where they are happening,'' she said. ''Not many of my girlfriends do that.''</p>
        <p>Jessie is an excellent all-around student. An aspiring doctor, she wrote in her Geography Bee biography that she admires Marie Curie, Amelia Earhart and Susan B. Anthony, ''because they proved that women could succeed.''</p>
        <p>And maybe they would have known that Irkutsk is a city in Russia.</p>
