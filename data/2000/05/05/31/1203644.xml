        <p>BRILLAT-SAVARIN admonished chefs 175 years ago that ''certain things which you do without thinking, and only because you have seen others do them, derive nonetheless from the highest scientific principles.''</p>
        <p>He should have met Heston Blumenthal.</p>
        <p>An exuberant, crew-cut 33-year-old chef, Mr. Blumenthal runs the Fat Duck, a restaurant in this idyllic village on the Thames, 35 miles west of London, where science joins art in the endless search for better flavor. He has allied himself with Peter Barham, a 49-year-old physicist at the University of Bristol, with remarkable results. In only a few years, the Duck has waddled to the top of several lists of England's best restaurants.</p>
        <p>As described on the menu, many of Mr. Blumenthal's dishes sound preposterously complicated, just too rococo for words. Perfecting the recipes has, in fact, required endless experimentation, and the actual preparation is unusually exacting and exhausting. But what finally emerges from Mr. Blumenthal's kitchen-cum-laboratory looks beautiful and tastes perfectly balanced and integrated -- almost inevitable.</p>
        <p>Take, for example, what he calls ''cuttlefish cannelloni of duck and maple syrup, parsley broth.''</p>
        <p>Making it, Mr. Blumenthal first cuts cuttlefish bodies into rectangles and then freezes them, which, he told me, breaks down molecules and makes them more tender. These are then cut into small squares, which are filled with a stuffing of preserved duck, duck ham, foie gras, cuttlefish and just a touch of maple syrup; rolled; steamed slightly; and served on a soupy, spectacularly herbal and intensely green puree of parsley. Wowee! Who would have thought those disparate ingredients could unite in such flavor fireworks?</p>
        <p>The cuttlefish dish is typical of the Fat Duck's food in several ways. It involves a scientific insight: the tenderizing effects of freezing. It balances salty and sweet ingredients, as does Mr. Blumenthal's bavarois of butternut squash with goat's milk ice cream. It matches fish with meat, like his dishes of sweetbreads with cockles and langoustine with pig's trotter.</p>
        <p>My wife, Betsey, and I ate our Easter dinner at the Fat Duck this year, and in keeping with the season, Mr. Blumenthal suggested that we order some lamb as a main course. As it turned out, we were the designated guinea pigs for one of his latest experiments, an innovative way of cooking lamb.</p>
        <p>Normally, ''doneness'' in meat, the point at which it ceases to be raw, is related to temperature, and browning it first is an almost universal technique. But Mr. Blumenthal wanted to see what would happen if fillets cut from a lamb T-bone were cooked for 45 or 50 minutes over very low heat -- say, 80 to 85 degrees -- in a pan barely slicked with oil, and turned every minute or two, so they never ''seized.''</p>
        <p>''It didn't sizzle or anything,'' he reported. ''It sat there and soaked up the heat. It never got that shock that ties the fibers up.''</p>
        <p>I don't think it would make me give up my rosemary-scented gigot, with its rich roasting juices, any more than ceviche made me abandon garlic-scented scallops bathed in beurre blanc. I'm too piggy for that.</p>
        <p>But this new technique was a revelation. The lamb had an exquisite tenderness, and something of the texture of carpaccio. It was incredibly moist. The rosy color was uniform right through, with no pink center or crusty exterior. And to my surprise, the absence of browning had in no way robbed the meat of flavor; we felt as if we were tasting the very essence of lamb, with no gaminess, a taste of fresh air and spring pastures.</p>
        <p>THERE appears to be no culinary shibboleth that Mr. Blumenthal will not challenge, and no limit to his search for a better way. Convinced that salting the water in which vegetables are cooked, which has been standard procedure since the Stone Age, only toughens them, he has stopped doing so.</p>
        <p>''We've experimented, with and without salt,'' he said. ''It makes no visible difference. It certainly doesn't keep the beans greener.''</p>
        <p>What does make a difference, Mr. Blumenthal found, is the quantity of calcium in the water.</p>
        <p>Tap water in Bray is rich in calcium, which makes it good to drink but bad for cooking, he said. Cooked with Evian, which has little calcium, Mr. Blumenthal's beans stayed green; cooked in vodka, which has none, they stayed greener. But simmering them in booze was no better for beans than for humans, the chef said: ''One, it costs too much, and two, the vodka tends to ignite.''</p>
        <p>The answer seems to be a water filtration system or, until that can be installed, distilled water. But the investigation continues.</p>
        <p>So does the hunt for some way to keep dry white beans from cracking when boiled -- a result, Mr. Blumenthal thinks, of a hardening of the beans' skins by chemicals in the water. And so does the foie gras inquiry. Mr. Blumenthal finds that cutting foie gras in different directions affects its texture, but until now he has been unable to discover why, even with the help of scientists at the Royal Veterinary College.</p>
        <p>''They said they saw no difference when they looked at the stuff under a microscope,'' the chef said. ''They thought I was quite mad.''</p>
        <p>But with the help of Professor Barham, Mr. Blumenthal has finally succeeded in making a sweet-sharp pineapple and chili jelly to serve with his spice-cake ice cream -- no mean feat, since the enzymes in pineapple fight the jelling agent, as almost every chef knows. Only a cook as cerebral and as obsessive as this one would even try to attack such a problem.</p>
        <p>JELLIES have preoccupied the Barham-Blumenthal team of late, partly because of their use by Ferran Adria at El Bulli, the Michelin three-star restaurant in Catalonia. He and Michel Bras at Laguiole in southwestern France, which also has three stars, are two of Europe's most original chefs, both fervently admired by Mr. Blumenthal. A jelly of mead, an old English fermented drink that is made from honey, gave a big lift to a ballottine of foie gras and smoked eel that was my favorite dish on a previous visit to the Duck.</p>
        <p>A manic, energetic man whose interests spill over the boundaries of his academic specialty, polymer physics, Professor Barham has traveled twice to Antarctica because, he confessed, ''my wife and I are basically obsessed by penguins.'' You can hear that same wacky passion as he tries to explain that jelly need not be limited to what we put on our toast.</p>
        <p>''Actually,'' he said, ''there's no reason you couldn't take two glasses of liquid, one containing a red, alkaline liquid, with the juice of red cabbage and fruit pectin in it, and the other a clear liquid, basically citric acid, and put them on the table. The guest could pour them together and over a dish of ice cream. In a flash, the liquid would turn blue and form a gel.</p>
        <p>''All great fun. But of course Heston would have to figure out some way to make it taste good.''</p>
        <p>The two meet fairly regularly, either in Bristol, an hour or so west of here by train or motorway, or at the restaurant. Some of the things they talk about, like a Brie souffle or that jellied blue sauce for ice cream, will probably never make their way onto the Fat Duck's menu. But they also do specific research on things like the feuillantine of crab that Mr. Blumenthal now uses in his best-known appetizer, paired with marinated salmon, roasted foie gras, crystallized seaweed and oyster vinaigrette -- another of those dishes that sound a little like a woman wearing one too many pieces of jewelry but astound almost everybody bold enough to order them.</p>
        <p>Crucial to the success of the dish is the tuilelike texture of the feuillantine, which is based on crab essence. The chef said he wanted ''something like a brandy snap, thin and shiny and crackling,'' but when he first made it, the feuillantine came out too biscuity, and he couldn't figure out how to add crunch. He tried increasing the oven temperature, reducing the moisture, adding gelatin and fiddling with the pH factor, all to little avail.</p>
        <p>What finally did the trick was maple syrup, again. Mr. Blumenthal says it worked because it introduced a different kind of carbohydrate to the equation. Professor Barham says, ''I don't really understand the science here.'' But the result tastes great and crackles to a fare-thee-well.</p>
        <p>Professor Barham takes part in a conference held every two years at Erice, in western Sicily, where like-minded spirits gather to discuss ''The Molecular and Physical Aspects of Gastronomy.'' Among other regular participants are Alan Davidson, the Oxford food scholar, and Harold McGee, whose book ''On Food and Cooking'' (Scribner, 1984) helped set Mr. Blumenthal on his path.</p>
        <p>''We try to get chefs to pose questions that we can answer,'' Professor Barham said. ''Heston is the perfect chef from our point of view. He has an open mind. He actually uses the research, whereas most chefs pick up the bits that reinforce their preconceptions and just ignore the rest.''</p>
        <p>MR. BLUMENTHAL fell in love with good cooking on a trip with his parents to the south of France in 1975, when he was a mere teenager. Like a thousand and one others, he found the food and the setting magical at Raymond Thuilier's great restaurant, the Baumaniere. Unlike most, he knew at once that he had found his vocation. He worked at various restaurants in London and, for a brief time, at the Manoir aux Quat'Saisons, near Oxford, where he met a youngster named Marco Pierre White, who went on, as the enfant terrible of London restaurateurs, to win three Michelin stars. They remain good friends, one sunny, the other turbulent, and Mr. White is the godfather of one of Mr. Blumenthal's children.</p>
        <p>Choosing to start a restaurant in Bray took a lot of nerve. The Fat Duck is just a few blocks from the Waterside Inn, the gilded stage on which Michel Roux, a great French classicist, has for many years done his three-star turn. At first, Mr. Blumenthal stuck with simple things -- rillettes of salmon, steak frites, lemon tart -- but what a tart, and what frites! Chubby little things, fried to crisp perfection, stacked like Lincoln Logs. They still arrive with the veal kidney roasted in its own fat.</p>
        <p>Gradually, Mr. Blumenthal turned to new twists on old dishes and to more exotic ingredients, and the menu is full of them now, from pollen to chlorophyll to piquillo peppers. He makes a bastilla of pigeon but adds cherries and unsweetened Manjari chocolate, as if it came from Mexico, not Morocco. With his fillet of venison he serves a traditional sauce poivrade but also a potato gratin hyped with snappy St.-Nectaire cheese.</p>
        <p>The service has grown more polished with the years, and now, under Nigel Sutcliffe (the ''sort-of manager,'' Mr. Blumenthal calls him), waiters can explain the most complex dishes quickly and clearly. The wine list is full of grand names these days (including scarce items like Harlan, Turley and Araujo cabernet sauvignons from California), but also affordable bottles from Austria, Alsace, Australia and Italy, including off-dry whites that go very well with Mr. Blumenthal's food.</p>
        <p>I had planned to start our Easter celebration with a Condrieu, pricey but promising, but the charming, laid-back wine waiter, Gilles Manvieu, had a far better idea. He served us an unprepossessing vin de pays -- same region, same grape (viognier) -- that cost half as much and drank better.</p>
        <p>Until now, the Duck itself has remained unchanged -- two plain rooms, no tablecloths, stainless-steel cutlery, beamed ceilings, wrought-iron tables and chairs, and a long, shiny copper bar. Too plain, some say, for the prices. Dinner can easily run $85, without wine or tip, although there is a far from meager three-course set lunch for $37.50.</p>
        <p>Changes in decor are on the way, including, to my great regret, the elimination of the bar to make room for a place for pre- and post-dinner drinks. That was inevitable, I guess; although this year's Good Food Guide ranks the Fat Duck among the top dozen country restaurants in England, and one of its inspectors reported that the three best meals that he ate in 1999 were all at the Duck, Michelin still gives it only one lonely star. For larger constellations, the red M demands a certain degree of luxury.</p>
        <p>GOAT'S MILK ICE CREAM  Adapted from the Fat Duck, Bray, England  Time: 20 minutes, plus cooling, chilling and freezing</p>
        <p>3 1/4 cups goat's milk  1 2/3 cups heavy cream</p>
        <p>7/8 cup sugar  6 large egg yolks.</p>
        <p>1. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan combine the goat's milk, cream and half the sugar; bring the mixture to a simmer. Meanwhile, whisk together the egg yolks and the remaining sugar in another bowl.</p>
        <p>2. Remove cream mixture from the heat, and add a little to the egg yolk mixture to warm it, stirring constantly to keep the yolks from cooking. Pour the egg yolk mixture into the saucepan, and cook it over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until it thickens very slightly, 3 to 4 minutes. Strain the mixture into a bowl, and let cool completely. Chill until thoroughly cold, at least 4 hours.</p>
        <p>3. Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
        <p>Yield: about 1 1/2 quarts.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 7, 2000, Wednesday  The first article in this series, last Wednesday, about the chef Heston Blumenthal, misstated the temperature for a low-heat method of cooking lamb fillets. It is 80 to 85 degrees Celsius (about 176 to 185 degrees Fahrenheit), not 80 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
