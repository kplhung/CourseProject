      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Like all rock stars, Rob Thomas knows how to milk a persona. Few, however, can claim the combination the Matchbox Twenty singer falls into naturally. Mr. Thomas, who led his band through a lengthy elbow-grease-powered set on Thursday at Irving Plaza, simultaneously inhabits two opposing adolescent roles: the burnout and the jock. His flustered attempts to articulate this strange position have made him the bane of critics and the hero of mainstream rock fans.</p>
        <p>In ocher leather pants and a faded  T-shirt, Mr. Thomas readily displayed his natural strengths: a stalwart physical charisma that stirs women's interest and men's sense of identification and an emphatic baritone with a memorable rumble. These alpha male qualities ran head-on into his other side: his vague stage presence, reflecting unshakable introversion, and the simmering indignation of his vocal delivery.</p>

        <p>Like all rock stars, Rob Thomas knows how to milk a persona. Few, however, can claim the combination the Matchbox Twenty singer falls into naturally. Mr. Thomas, who led his band through a lengthy elbow-grease-powered set on Thursday at Irving Plaza, simultaneously inhabits two opposing adolescent roles: the burnout and the jock. His flustered attempts to articulate this strange position have made him the bane of critics and the hero of mainstream rock fans.</p>
        <p>In ocher leather pants and a faded  T-shirt, Mr. Thomas readily displayed his natural strengths: a stalwart physical charisma that stirs women's interest and men's sense of identification and an emphatic baritone with a memorable rumble. These alpha male qualities ran head-on into his other side: his vague stage presence, reflecting unshakable introversion, and the simmering indignation of his vocal delivery.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas seemed like a guy who by all rights should have been popular and successful but for some perverse reason decided to be an outsider. He claimed strangeness and vulnerability without giving up the privileges of machismo.</p>
        <p>The same weave of personality traits influences Mr. Thomas's songwriting. Songs from the new album, ''Mad Season by Matchbox Twenty''  (Atlantic Records), surveyed wrecked relationships in verses that sounded like one side of a disastrous lovers' spat. With titles like ''Angry,'' ''Bent'' and ''Leave'' (following in the tradition of ''Push,'' the band's huge 1998 hit, and ''Smooth,'' Mr. Thomas's even more successful 1999 partnering with Carlos Santana) these simmering rockers  hooked into the mind-clouding energy of emotional defensiveness. Their  hooky choruses made these petulant tales palatable.</p>
        <p>The drama of Mr. Thomas's divided self is Matchbox Twenty's selling point. The band churns out serviceable dance-rock with pretensions toward funkiness that betray its Southern roots. During ''Stop,'' the night's opening act, Angie Aparo, joined Mr. Thomas for a vocal throw-down that made Irving Plaza feel like a Tulane University fraternity party at around 3 a.m. In other moments, the group slowed down, approximating the easygoing rock that emanated from Chevy vans in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>The band worked hard; the music was pleasant if undistinctive. Mr. Thomas poured out his unfocused soul. Matchbox Twenty didn't seem deserving of critical drubbing. This stuff is harmless, right? Probably.</p>
        <p>But to anyone who cherishes rock as the provenance of genuine outcasts, from its African-American founders to the gender-benders and misfits who have dominated its history, Matchbox Twenty seem like interlopers. Every regular guy may have a social reject inside him. It's just a little irritating when he doesn't seem to grasp that he's still on top.</p>
