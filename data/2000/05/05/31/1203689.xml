        <p>President Clinton today became the first president to visit Portugal since Ronald Reagan in 1985, and as Mr. Clinton opened his last scheduled trip to Europe as president, he found himself confronting the same major issues that Mr. Reagan faced -- trade disputes and missile defense.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Reagan supported a space-based missile defense system known as Star Wars, Mr. Clinton will be pushing his own plan to deploy a limited missile defense system, if he can reach agreement on modifying the 28-year-old Antiballistic Missile Treaty.</p>
        <p>As they had done for days leading up to the trip, aides to Mr. Clinton stressed again today that they did not expect him to reach any concrete agreements, as Mr. Reagan also failed to do 15 years ago. But in contrast to the significant anti-American demonstrations that Mr. Reagan received, only one ''Clinton Go Home'' slogan was seen today on a wall in Lisbon.</p>
        <p>An article today in the left-of-center daily Publico underscored the difficulty Mr. Clinton faces in selling his missile defense initiative -- not only to Russia but also to the rest of the world. The newspaper compared Mr. Clinton's dilemma to that of Mr. Reagan on ''Star Wars,'' saying Mr. Clinton will ''have to persuade his European partners that the new American antimissile defense system that the U.S. wants to develop can bring advantages to European security and world peace.''</p>
        <p>''But this is a difficult task,'' the article continued, ''especially for a president at the end of his career, in the face of negative reaction already expressed in most European capitals. Europe is afraid that this initiative, a 'soft' version of Ronald Reagan 'Star Wars' in the 80's, will end up triggering a new arms race, alienating Russia and feeding Beijing's nuclear ambitions.''</p>
        <p>Few people turned out to see Mr. Clinton today. But the president still found that the opening day of his weeklong trip to Europe was full of mutual praise and old-fashioned sightseeing, and his day of meetings with a close ally was relatively free of contentious issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton reinforced just how enjoyable a day it had been, saying in a toast to Portugal's president, Jorge Sampaio, at a state dinner tonight: ''It has been a pleasure for me to spend time with another president who likes to read detective novels, listen to good music and play golf. We could have had a two-day summit on those three topics alone.''</p>
        <p>From here Mr. Clinton will travel to Berlin, to Moscow -- where he will have his first meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin -- and finally to Kiev, Ukraine. While in Berlin, he will also meet privately with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, who will be attending a political conference along with Mr. Clinton and other leaders. The two leaders are expected to discuss Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon last week and the status of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.</p>
        <p>Welcoming Mr. Clinton to Portugal today, President Sampaio said: ''It was from here five centuries ago that the Portuguese navigators -- who explored the Atlantic coast of Africa, discovered the maritime route to India, found Brazil and circumnavigated the earth -- set sail.  Our increasingly globalized world owes a lot to their deeds.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton echoed Mr. Sampaio's words, saying, ''Here at this historic point of embarkation, from which Portuguese explorers led an entire continent to see beyond the horizon, we find ourselves again, as you said, Mr. President, on a new voyage of discovery.''</p>
        <p>The two men stood together at the sun-bleached limestone 16th-century Belem Tower at the entrance to Lisbon's harbor, where Portuguese frigates honored Mr. Clinton with a 21-gun salute. The two presidents reviewed an honor guard of paratroopers in fatigues, white gloves and purple ascots who are headed to East Timor as part of a United Nations peacekeeping force. Portugal asserted residual rights over East Timor, which is now moving toward independence, for more than two decades after the territory was seized by Indonesia in 1975.</p>
        <p>''I know that this nation is proud of those troops and their mission, and on behalf of the American people, I thank you for it,'' Mr. Clinton told Mr. Sampaio.</p>
        <p>From there, a cavalry regiment of musicians on horseback led Mr. Clinton's motorcade to the Jeronimos Monastery in the town of Belem. There, he laid a wreath at the carved tomb of the poet Luis Camoes and spent half an hour touring the 16th-century structure.</p>
        <p>Then, after a tour of the interactive Knowledge Science Center, Mr. Clinton told scientists and researchers, ''I have just had a lot of fun.'' He also praised what he called cutting-edge research across national boundaries on diseases like AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. ''These diseases can ruin economies and threaten the very survival of societies,'' said Mr. Clinton, whose administration has elevated issues like disease to the top of the national security agenda.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, at the 17th-century Queluz Palace outside Lisbon, Mr. Clinton will meet with the European Commission's president, Romano Prodi, and Portugal's prime minister, Antonio Guterres. Portugal currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union.</p>
        <p>The United States and the 15-nation European Union are locked in complicated disputes over European restrictions on the importation of bananas, American beef and genetically modified foods.</p>
        <p>On the other side, the European Union objects to a sales tax break that the United Sates grants to major corporations that set up operations in offshore tax havens like the Virgin Islands and Barbados. Those companies are not required to pay American sales tax and duties on their exports, which the European Union argues is a form of subsidy that will amount to about $25 billion to American companies over the next five years.</p>
        <p>In Berlin, Mr. Clinton will attend a meeting with leaders of more than a dozen other countries on ''third way'' politics, with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder as host. The approach, also described as ''progressive governance,'' explores a middle ground between traditional forms of socialism and capitalism.</p>
        <p>In Aachen, Germany, on Friday, Mr. Clinton will be awarded the International Charlemagne Prize, presented annually to a person who has worked toward European unity. Other recipients of the award have been Churchill and Francois Mitterrand, the late French president. The only Americans to have received the award have been George C. Marshall, author of America's plan to rebuild Europe after World War II, and former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.</p>
        <p>During the weekend, Mr. Clinton will be in Moscow for his first summit meeting with Mr. Putin. Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, told reporters last week that the visit would produce no breakthroughs in arms control or Russia's objections to an American missile defense plan.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Clinton will address the Russian Parliament, becoming the first American president to do so. Later that day, he will travel to Ukraine for a meeting with President Leonid Kuchma before heading home to Washington that night.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has eight months left as president, but in some quarters he is already being talked about in the past tense.</p>
        <p>The article in Publico, the Portuguese daily, said of his visit: ''On the other side of the Atlantic, he is looked as if he already belonged to the past. In Europe, he is being given the prize to those who have aided the European cause. Bill Clinton was a good president to Europe.'' The article was titled, ''Clinton Says Goodbye to Europe.''</p>
        <p>And Portugal's leading tabloid newspaper, Correio da Manha, focused on Mr. Clinton's enormous $4,000-a-night suite at the Dom Pedro Hotel. Situated on the top floor, it has, the newspaper said, a panoramic view of the capital, ''a private elevator for security, luxury furniture, original works of art, a spacious hall, tropical plants, a bar, a winter garden and a private terrace of 160 square meters.''</p>
        <p>''It also has a private dining room for 12 people, with a terrace of 60 square meters, connected to a fully equipped kitchen,'' it continued. ''The suite has two more rooms, the bigger of which looks out to a natural solarium. There is a dressing room and a marble bathroom connected to this room, as well as panoramic vistas over Lisbon, a sauna, a Jacuzzi with hydro massage.''</p>
        <p>At the state dinner tonight, Mr. Clinton was serenaded by Mafalda Arnauth, Portugal's hottest young fado singer. Fado is melancholic Portuguese music played with string instruments and built around the concept of saudades, the yearning for a past that was better and may never return.</p>
