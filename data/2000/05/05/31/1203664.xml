        <p>Sy Sternberg, the chairman of New York Life Insurance, is in China this week trying to figure out whom to meet so as to ensure that his company is next among the dozens of insurers who have applied for a license to do business in China.</p>
        <p>''We don't know what the process is in awarding licenses,'' said Mr. Sternberg, though New York Life has devoted more resources than almost any other American insurer to securing the right to operate here. He has tried to touch all the bases -- from officials of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission to Prime Minister Zhu Rongji. Still, he cannot be sure that he has met the person who makes the final decision.</p>
        <p>So it goes in China's murky business world, where market access depends on whom you know and how happy you have made them -- though no one will tell you who those people are. Instead, chief executives like Mr. Sternberg operate on supposition and hearsay to identify the hidden decision makers and cultivate ''top of mind,'' which means making their company the first that Chinese leaders think of when considering foreign supplicants from their industry.</p>
        <p>China's entry into the World Trade Organization is supposed to change all that, and with the House willing to grant China permanent normal trade relations, American companies are expected to share in any W.T.O. bounty. The Senate is also considered likely to approve normal trading status for China. Were Congress not to grant Beijing such status, it could enter the W.T.O. anyway and exclude the United States from many trade benefits that W.T.O. membership conveys.</p>
        <p>As part of China's W.T.O. membership, the country has promised to publish all rules and regulations governing trade and to create clear procedures for acquiring licenses to do things like sell insurance in the country. If Beijing holds to its promise, China will undergo a sea change in how business is conducted and take a step toward government by rule of law instead of administrative fiat.</p>
        <p>''It's not going to happen overnight, but 10 years from now we'll look back and say it was a turning point,'' said Patrick Cranley, the head of the Cigna Corporation's efforts to win a license in China and chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce here in Shanghai.</p>
        <p>In fact, China's transition to Western-style transparency is likely to be piecemeal and slow. But the insurance industry is one of the areas that promises a reasonable pace of change, for one thing because there is little concern that foreign companies can dominate a market in which comfort and familiarity play such a key role. The state-owned People's Insurance Company of China currently has 70 percent of the market.</p>
        <p>Domestic companies stand to benefit almost as much as foreign concerns from the promised candor. Already, Western insurers have helped crack open markets that orthodox state-owned companies never considered or dared not try to enter for fear of angering officials in Beijing.</p>
        <p>For example, no Chinese insurer sold life insurance to individuals before the American International Group won a license to do so in Shanghai seven years ago. The slim commissions paid to Chinese insurance agents did not warrant the effort. Then A.I.G. began paying its agents as much as 40 percent of the first year's premium and the individual life insurance business took off.</p>
        <p>''No one imagined that Beijing would allow that, so no one ever tried,'' said Albert Lu, a former agent for the China Pacific Insurance Company and now ING Insurance's chief representative in China. All major Chinese life insurers offer individual policies today.</p>
        <p>China needs a developed insurance industry now more than ever as the country tries to shift the burden of cradle-to-grave benefits away from its over-encumbered state enterprises, half of them only breaking even or losing money. Instead of providing free medical care, many state-owned companies are buying health insurance for their employees. A move from state-subsidized housing in favor of individually owned homes has increased the need for property and casualty insurance. And many people now buy life insurance with an annuity attached that serves as a pension.</p>
        <p>Growth in the market has slowed from what it was a few years ago, but remains higher than in Western economies. Life insurance premiums, which grew 40 percent annually early in the 1990's, are still growing at more than 10 percent a year. And life insurance premiums account for only about 1 percent of China's total economic output -- one of the lowest rates in the world, and behind nations like Bulgaria and Zimbabwe.</p>
        <p>Once China enters the W.T.O., it has promised to lift restrictions on the number of foreign companies it will allow to operate. Foreigners are to be allowed to sell insurance in at least three cities immediately upon China's joining the global trade group. After three years, all national restrictions are to disappear and foreign insurers allowed to sell group insurance, the market's largest segment, from which foreign companies are still barred.</p>
        <p>For now, though, no one knows what the licensing process will be and so companies like New York Life and Cigna are continuing their relationship-building strategy. New York Life, for example, has established a $250 million infrastructure investment fund that it will use to support Beijing's current drive to build up the country's long-neglected Western regions. To help invest the money, the insurance company has hired the China Development Bank, run by Chen Yuan, former deputy governor of the Chinese central bank, which was the country's insurance regulator until late 1998.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sternberg of New York Life has spent much of his own time lobbying for the license or otherwise trying to demonstrate his support for China, meeting for example with more than 100 members of Congress to push for normal trading relations.</p>
        <p>''Our growth strategy is to expand into high-growth emerging markets,'' Mr. Sternberg said, ''and China is an important part of that strategy, so it's important that I dedicate my time.''</p>
