        <p>Letter from Philip Kassen (West 47th-48th Streets Block Association) says his group has tried in vain to get mayor's office and Police Department to take action against New York Apple Tours (May 27 article)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am a member of one of the neighborhood organizations that have been ''protesting these oversized vehicles since they first appeared almost eight years ago'' (''Double-Decker Menace,'' editorial, May 27). It was surprising for me to see the same members of the mayor's office and Police Department who have ignored our pleas in the past now demand that city and state laws and regulations be enforced after a New York Apple Tours bus killed a pedestrian.</p>
        <p>Our members routinely ask city staff members and police officers to stop buses from driving on streets where they are prohibited. Our requests are met with blank stares or, worse, dismissal. It is shameful that it has taken the death of a neighbor to create the political will to enforce the law.</p>
        <p>PHILIP KASSEN  New York, May 27, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is vice president of the West 47th-48th Streets Block Association.</p>
