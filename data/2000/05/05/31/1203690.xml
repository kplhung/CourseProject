        <p>More than 18 months after Oregon passed the nation's first voter-approved law allowing all adult adoptees access to their birth records, a Supreme Court justice ended an emotional legal-appeals process today and cleared the way for the law to take effect this afternoon.</p>
        <p>A group of birth mothers had sued to block the law, contending that it would violate promises made years ago by adoption agencies that their identity would never be revealed against their will to the children they had given up for adoption. State officials announced today that they would begin processing requests for birth certificates from any adoptee  21 or older who was born in the state.</p>
        <p>The state Health Division said it had already received requests from more than 2,200 adoptees for the records under a provision set up by the law, Measure 58, which was approved in November 1998. But those applications have not been acted on pending the outcome of the challenge to the law, which was upheld earlier this year by the state's Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor today rejected an emergency request from the birth mothers to delay the records law's taking effect, and the state said it would probably start mailing out copies of birth records by the end of the week.</p>
        <p>In many cases, of course, adoptees and birth parents have sought out each other, using one of a growing number of registries and Web sites that foster such reunions. But the Oregon case, by giving adoptees absolute rights to their records even if birth mothers never sought contact, set off a turbulent debate over whose rights should take precedence.</p>
        <p>Adoptees have cast access to their birth certificates as a right that might answer basic questions about the circumstances of their birth and perhaps the medical histories of their biological parents.</p>
        <p>''People are very mindful of their roots and where they came from,'' said Berry Price, a 56-year-old machinist who, as an adoptee, cheered Justice O'Connor's action today. ''Bringing somebody into the world without giving them some background on their situation, their ethnic origin and so forth, I think that's wrong. You have this hole in your background, and you feel a need to fill it in.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Price knows that his birth mother may well be dead and that the name on his birth certificate may be fictitious anyway. Nonetheless, he has filed his application and is eagerly awaiting word.</p>
        <p>On the other side of the debate, a group of six anonymous birth mothers has fought vigorously against the law through their Portland-based lawyer, Franklin Hunsaker, himself the father of five adopted children.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hunsaker said today that his clients were ''extremely disappointed, scared and even angry that their rights have been ignored by voters and the courts.'' And he pleaded with adoptees to respect the wishes of those biological mothers who have filed a separate state form indicating that they do not wish to be contacted. That request is not legally enforceable.</p>
        <p>''The only good reunion is one based on mutual consent, where both sides want it to happen,'' Mr. Hunsaker said in a telephone interview. ''So if there's a request there,'' he said, meaning a preference not to be contacted, ''my clients would plead with adult adoptees not to trample on their rights. Please honor it.''</p>
        <p>Thomas McDermott, an adoptive father who is the lawyer for the law's supporters, said he disagreed with the critics who said the law would set off a spate of incidents in which birth mothers were contacted against their will, a prospect that one of the women suing to block the law said had given her ''flashbacks and nightmares.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McDermott said he believed that most adoptees would not pursue a meeting if they knew their biological parents did not wish to meet them.</p>
        <p>''I think it would take a rather unusual adoptee to pursue that,'' he said. ''Why would you go somewhere when you're told you're not welcome?''</p>
        <p>However, he added, in the great majority of cases, biological parents welcome such overtures. In Oregon, according to the most recent records released by the Health Division, 40 birth parents have filled out a form indicating that they desire contact from the children they gave up for adoption, and 16 have requested no contact.</p>
        <p>Oregon is unique in having a voter-passed initiative opening up the birth records. But at least three other states (Tennessee, Alaska and Delaware) have various provisions, either passed in the legislature or mandated by the courts, allowing adoptees access to their birth certificates. And Kansas has never had an explicit prohibition against such access.</p>
        <p>Such records do not automatically enable an adoptee to find a birth parent. In some cases, birth mothers managed to have their names omitted from the birth certificate, and in other cases a name alone would not be enough information to allow the birth parent to be found.</p>
        <p>In Oregon, where the courts found that birth mothers had no constitutional right to keep their biological children's birth certificates confidential, some of the anonymous mothers argued in court papers that they were afraid that their husbands or children might now discover long-guarded secrets that could cause turmoil in their families. And lawyers for those opposing the law said that some of the birth mothers had been raped, and that a call from the person who resulted from that crime would be traumatic.</p>
        <p>The birth mothers who brought the case have not been identified publicly. One, using the name ''Mary,'' wrote in a letter to The Oregonian earlier this year that she was horrified by the law.</p>
        <p>''Soon, for $15, the state may simply hand over your identity to the adult you placed for adoption as an infant 21-plus years ago,'' she wrote. ''In a few days, the very promises we built our lives upon may be up for sale.''</p>
        <p>But the law's supporters were jubilant, saying the law properly extended to adoptees the right to gather information about the most basic of questions: where did they come from?</p>
