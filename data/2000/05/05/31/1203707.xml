        <p>Bickering this election year between Democrats and Republicans over a drug benefit for Medicare enrollees has been shrill.

        <p>Mr. Wyden and Mr. Thomas agreed that any Medicare drug benefit should be a universal benefit to which the elderly are legally entitled. That might seem innocuous. But Mr. Wyden's efforts will be opposed by Democrats who want to head into November with no agreement.

        <p>Bickering this election year between Democrats and Republicans over a drug benefit for Medicare enrollees has been shrill. But Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, and Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California, two influential leaders on health care, announced a set of principles last week that, by blurring the distinction between the parties, might yield compromise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wyden and Mr. Thomas agreed that any Medicare drug benefit should be a universal benefit to which the elderly are legally entitled. That might seem innocuous. But Mr. Wyden's efforts will be opposed by Democrats who want to head into November with no agreement. Mr. Thomas will win little applause in the Republican caucus for embracing the proposition that what America needs is another federal entitlement.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Thomas was right to declare the principle because the existing Medicare entitlement, lacking a drug benefit, is seriously deficient. Indeed, Mr. Thomas points to a Republican plan to show that the idea of a universal entitlement is in sync with party policy even if the words rub the wrong way.</p>
        <p>Under the G.O.P. plan, every Medicare enrollee would be offered a drug policy whose premiums and other costs would be heavily subsidized or eliminated for low-income families. The government would pick up all of an enrollee's drug costs above a ceiling, say $2,000 a year. The White House plan focuses on subsidizing initial drug outlays, which Congressional Democrats would amend by adding catastrophic coverage.</p>
        <p>Proposals differ on important details. The White House, for example, would have the agency that runs Medicare negotiate with one benefit company per region to organize coverage for most enrollees. Most Republicans and some Democrats like Mr. Wyden want a new Medicare board to negotiate with competing drug-benefit companies.</p>
        <p>Beyond the pros and cons of specific proposals, the Wyden-Thomas agreement serves as a worthy guideline for policy. But the accord's enduring feature may be that, by showing that serious Democrats and Republicans can agree on important principles, it dulls the posturing that has so far kept Congress from doing anything serious.</p>
