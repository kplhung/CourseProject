        <p>When a group of rap legends and Harlem-based artists announced last month that they would be mounting a Broadway-style musical in the landmark Apollo Theater, the show was presented not only as an indicator of Harlem's economic and cultural renewal, but as the birth of a virtually new theatrical genre as well: the hip-hop musical.</p>
        <p>But nothing is ever simple when it comes to exploring an embryonic artistic form, or, for that matter, stretching the borders of artistic expression in Harlem. The Apollo has never been known as a venue for plays. And while hip-hop may have invaded every other aspect of culture, it has not yet established a place for itself on the American stage.</p>
        <p>The play, ''Echo Park,'' opens tomorrow. It has drawn on rap legends and community resources like the National Black Theater and the Julia de Burgos Cultural Center, and it looks to set down a version of hip-hop history at a time when the genre, now more than 20 years old, is given more and more to reflection and historiography. As with almost any theatrical production, this one has had its share of artistic struggles, sleepless nights and financial headaches, but ''Echo Park'' also comes to the stage bearing the burden of trying something that has not been done before.</p>
        <p>A week before the curtain was to rise, the big dance numbers were almost seamless, with break dancers leaping effortlessly into back flips and diving across the stage into head spins, and the rappers hitting their marks dead on. But the director was lamenting that the dramatic scenes verged on lethargy, and the producers were still worrying about the financial troubles of a venture that must turn a profit.</p>
        <p>The first installment of a trilogy that traces the genre's history since 1978, ''Echo Park'' is a would-be ''Hair'' for the hip-hop generation, chronicling the rise of a rough-hewn cultural form from the neglected parks and train yards of Harlem and the Bronx to a multibillion-dollar industry. The cast includes the rap luminaries Kurtis Blow, Grandmaster Caz and D.J. Hollywood, but the producers, Lifted Productions, also took a grass-roots approach, enlisting graffiti writers to design the set, city B-boys for break-dancing parts and untested neighborhood actors for other roles.</p>
        <p>The producers, who regard this presentation of Echo Park as a work in progress, have held ticket prices to $20 to $35 and have not invited critics to the one-month run at the Apollo.</p>
        <p>''We want to get input from the community and improve it so it's ready for a tour, or going overseas, or maybe going to Broadway,'' said Eric H. Vinson, the executive producer. ''The idea is to get an affirmation from the Harlem community, because, if you've ever watched 'Amateur Night at the Apollo,' you know how hard the audiences there can be. That's the real test for us.''</p>
        <p>The project was born two and a half years ago, when Kelly D. Scott, a former model and actor who has appeared in small parts in television sitcoms like ''Martin'' and ''Living Single,'' teamed up with Sean Couch, a former N.B.A. basketball player and, later, a financial analyst for such Wall Street firms as PaineWebber and Shearson Lehman.</p>
        <p>At the time, Mr. Couch and Ms. Scott were both working on an all-black production of the Maxwell Anderson play ''The Bad Seed'' at the Victoria Five Theater in Harlem. Neither is an accomplished playwright, though each has done some theatrical writing -- in 1996, after Mr. Couch left Wall Street, he wrote ''The History of the Blues,'' for the National Black Theater; Ms. Scott, a published poet, has written two unproduced scripts. They wrote the script and produced ''Echo Park'' together, with Ms. Scott, a neophyte, directing.</p>
        <p>The two had grown up just blocks apart in Inwood Heights but had never met, and they shared many of the same childhood experiences. Both  spent time in the late 1970's in Echo Park, off Tremont Avenue in the west Bronx, where disc jockeys would rig their sound systems to lampposts and mix funk and R &amp; B sounds r to create a danceable beat. They witnessed the emergence of break dancing at such ''park jams,'' where teenagers from opposing gangs faced off and ''battled'' each other to flaunt head spins, back flips, robotic maneuvers and other novel moves.</p>
        <p>''We now have a whole generation of kids who grew up in hip-hop culture but don't understand its origins,'' Mr. Couch said. ''They don't know that it's a lot more than them getting on the mike and rapping. Hip-hop was an explosion of suppression. The thread that runs through it all was the desire to be seen and heard, the ability to shine. I wanted to tell that history through the people who lived it.''</p>
        <p>The writers looked to their own experiences for inspiration.</p>
        <p>''I wrote the park scenes because I was in the park a lot playing ball, and the club scenes were Kelly, because her aunt was a big promoter and she was in the modeling scene,'' Mr. Couch said.</p>
        <p>But they were also influenced by the stories of those around them. As Ms. Scott put it, ''D.J. Hollywood, Grandmaster Flash and all those guys were my heroes.''</p>
        <p>Most notably, they lifted moments from the life of Grandmaster Caz, born in the Bronx as Curtis Brown, and reborn in the 70's as M.C. and D.J. Casanova Fly. When he was 19 and a member of the Cold Crush Four, Mr. Brown offered a book of his rhymes to his group's manager, Henry (Big Bank Hank) Jackson, who went on to record the seminal ''Rapper's Delight'' (''I said, hip hop, the hippie, the hippie, to the hip hip hop'') as part of the Sugarhill Gang in 1979.</p>
        <p>The song is widely regarded as the hit that began rap's invasion of the mainstream, and Casanova Fly, supported by a number of hip-hop historians, claims authorship, although he says he has never seen a dollar for his work. In the play, a character named Doc achieves fame after stealing the main character's signature raps.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown's is a quintessential music business story, and because he is also performing in the show, it hovers in the rehearsal hall like a kind of medieval morality play. As a generic D.J. narrator in ''Echo Park,'' Mr. Brown is boyishly gleeful in his role, especially when he's spinning mixes at the turntables. ''I think this story is based on everyone's story,'' he said. ''Everyone coming up in the pioneer days of hip-hop can relate to it.''</p>
        <p>The authors also borrowed loosely from Kurtis Blow's early life. Born Kurt Walker, he was a precocious young man who grew up in Harlem in the 70's and much to his mother's consternation spent a lot of his time scratching up her records. ''At 13, I knew I wanted to be a D.J.,'' he said. ''I knew this was going to be big, huge. I had no doubt.''</p>
        <p>The main character, Scott Jenkins, routinely clashes with his mother, secretly a rhythm and blues singer, who calls his form of expression ''loud, stupid music.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker, as he prefers to be called, now 40, was living in Woodland Hills, Calif., enjoying life as a family man with his three young  sons, writing theme songs for the NBA teams, and working as a disc jockey on the Los Angeles radio station KPWR, ''Power 106,'' when Ms. Scott, an old friend, asked him to return to New York City for the production last year.</p>
        <p>Back in the city for the first time in 15 years, Mr. Blow, who is on a leave of absence from his radio job, appreciates the admirers who stop him as he walks from the East Harlem rehearsal studio to a pizza place nearby. ''I go home feeling life has revisited these old bones,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Although he wonders privately if the M.C. character, Doc, may be portrayed as a bit too much of ''a snake,'' (arguing that M.C.'s were often the ones who got lost in the fame game) he says he wanted to participate in the musical because it helps set the record straight.</p>
        <p>''There's so many different versions of the history,'' he said. ''Now, everyone is fighting for their own part of the history when in actuality, we're all part of the fabric.''</p>
        <p>Because the writers were on a mission to create a comprehensive picture of hip-hop's early years, 1978 to 1981, they brought a variety of elements together on the stage: break dancing, graffiti art, D.J.'s and rappers.</p>
        <p>''This show is the first of its kind to incorporate all the elements of hip-hop culture, the music, dance, art and spoken word,'' said the show's choreographer, Adesola A. Osakalumi. ''You're not just seeing the parts, but the integration of the parts.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Osakalumi, who has been break dancing since the 70's, is a member of GhettOriginal Productions, the dance company behind ''Jam on the Groove,'' which ran at the Minetta Lane Theater in 1995. Jon Pareles, the chief pop critic of The New York Times, called the show ''jubilantly hyperactive'' in a review.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Osakalumi said that keeping the dances period-specific was a  challenge. ''There were dance moves that were done then that are now lost,'' he said. ''Then there are others that have evolved, like the elbow spin -- they used to do a half-spin and now they do four or five spins -- so the dancers have to resist the temptation to push it forward.''</p>
        <p>Similar difficulties were faced by the Big Time Crew, a graffiti art group from the Tremont section of the Bronx, which spraypainted the boldly colorful wild-style graffiti set. ''It's much more elemental than the work today,'' said Joe Rodriguez, a member of the Crew. ''Now, we're more into background and sceneries. Before, it was just your name, or wild-style train art.''</p>
        <p>The producers spent two years looking for the right mix of artists, and, about a year ago, held auditions that attracted actors and dancers from as far away as Germany and Japan. But they decided to cast closer to home.</p>
        <p>One dancer, Josh Ortiz, 18, is a nephew of the Bronx dancers the Incredible Breakers and learned many of his moves from his uncles. Alien Ness, 32, born Luis Martinez in the Bronx, was an original member of Zulu Nation, a group that assembled around the rap figure Afrika Bambaataa, and often frequented Echo Park as a teenager. ''I'm practically playing myself,'' said Mr. Martinez, whose character in the show is called Kid Ness. ''That's what they called me when I was 12.''</p>
        <p>Because many in the cast had no professional acting experience, the group spent six weeks training at the National Black Theater in Harlem. And they spent five weeks in rehearsal at the Burgos center in East Harlem.</p>
        <p>Writing the script and assembling the cast, the producers said, was easier than securing financial support. Mr. Couch and Ms. Kelly enlisted Mr. Vinson to do the heavy hitting. Until 1993 Mr. Vinson headed a sports and entertainment management and marketing company whose clients included Savion Glover and Ossie Davis; he is now a managing partner in Interactive Sports Signals, which he said enhances the sound systems in sports arenas. As executive producer, he had enough pull to convince executives at Colgate-Palmolive and Pepsi to support the production through joint marketing efforts. But Ms. Scott, Mr. Couch and Mr. Vinson also invested some of their own money in the production, which has a $250,000 budget.</p>
        <p>There were also nonbudgetary hurdles.</p>
        <p>The Apollo, acclaimed for starting the careers of musical giants like Ella Fitzgerald and James Brown and producing the television show ''It's Showtime at the Apollo,'' has never been known as a theatrical  venue, although it regularly presents shows touring on the ''chitlin circuit''  of black-oriented theater pieces. By opening up the theater's doors to productions like this, said Grace Blake, executive director of the Apollo Theater Foundation, the theater's governing board, the theater hopes to attract a new crowd.</p>
        <p>Those involved hope it will also serve another purpose.</p>
        <p>''A person like me who has been in hip-hop for 25 years wants to see the same things stay alive -- the routines and the mannerisms -- passed down through the generations,'' said Mr. Blow. ''Because as much as we need to change the bad things, the good things need to be passed along too.''</p>
