        <p>Even as artillery shells plopped into dusty fields here today, Ethiopia took a big step toward ending the war with its neighbor Eritrea by saying it would withdraw troops from territory it has captured in western Eritrea over the last 18 days.</p>
        <p>Ethiopia made the announcement as peace talks, aimed at ending the two-year-long war between the two nations, opened today in Algeria.</p>
        <p>The United States State Department weighed in on the conflict today, saying it had verified that Eritrea had also pulled back from territory that Ethiopia claims as its own.  ''We have confirmed that Eritrea has done so,'' the State Department said in a statement issued in Washington.</p>
        <p>In a rare situation since the conflict began, each nation has now made what appears to be a public concession to the other. And while there is no guarantee the war will be over soon, it would be far harder to end without the announced withdrawal of troops on each side.</p>
        <p>Still the bitterness and distrust that has characterized this war -- which began as a border dispute in May 1998 -- was on full display today. The Eritrean government denied that Ethiopia had pulled back its troops from areas in the west that it has captured since it began a major, and largely successful, offensive on May 12.</p>
        <p>Yemane Ghebremeskel, a spokesman for the Eritrean government, said the Ethiopians had in fact taken another Eritrean town, Teseney, near the border with Sudan.</p>
        <p>''It's a strange way of withdrawing,'' Mr. Ghebremeskel said.</p>
        <p>But Selome Taddesse, an Ethiopian spokeswoman, insisted that the withdrawal was real, although she denied that it was a gesture toward peace.</p>
        <p>The land Ethiopia said it has left was captured only since the offensive began this month, reaching north from the Eritrean border to the town of Barentu.</p>
        <p>The land that Eritrea says it has now abandoned was taken in 1998, when border skirmishes between the two countries became full warfare that has claimed tens of thousands of lives in sporadic fighting.</p>
        <p>Eritrea gained its independence from Ethiopia only in 1993, and many of the problems have stemmed from the fact that the nations' 620-mile border was never officially marked off. What is still unsettled is the territory here along the central front, about 60 miles south of the Eritrean capital, Asmara, and the main target of the Ethiopian offensive.</p>
        <p>Ethiopia has pushed its way into Eritrean territory, it says, only as a temporary strategic position. Both sides have reported major battles in the last week, though the fighting has been less fierce in the last three days.</p>
        <p>Today, Eritrean soldiers hidden in crevices along the mountains here watched as shells landed from the Ethiopian front, near the town of Senafe, and blasted out from positions here.</p>
        <p>Ethiopia says it pushed the Eritreans back by military force, though the Eritreans here say they have moved back waiting for a good place to fight. Whether the war goes on, even as their leaders discuss peace, is ''their choice,'' said Col. Habtu Gebrendras, a local commander.</p>
        <p>''If they withdraw from our country, good,'' he said. ''If they don't withdraw from our country, we will continue to defend it and return our territories to ourselves.''</p>
