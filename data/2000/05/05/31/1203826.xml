        <p>The Nets are nearing the end of their search for a president and director of basketball operations and should announce a decision by the end of the week, according to an official with YankeeNets.</p>
        <p>It is not clear whether an announcement on the new head coach will be made, but two of the candidates for director of basketball, John Thompson and Isiah Thomas, are also potential coaches.</p>
        <p>Los Angeles Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak, Indiana Pacers General Manager David Kahn and perhaps Danny Ainge, the former coach of the Phoenix Suns, are also candidates for the front-office positions.</p>
        <p>Two YankeeNets officials denied published reports that Michael Jackson would become the club's president. But Jackson, who was hired last month by Yankee-Nets to work in a television capacity, will have a role in the basketball operations.</p>
        <p>Kenny Smith, a TNT analyst and a former player, has been mentioned as a possible coaching candidate, but Harvey Schiller, the YankeeNets chairman, rejected that notion yesterday, saying, ''He's not interested, and neither are we.''</p>
        <p>There have also been reports that the Nets are interested in St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis, but Jarvis's agent, Robert Ades, said the team had shown no interest in his client. ''There's nothing going on there at all,'' Ades said.</p>
