        <p>Glen Sather and the Rangers have officially agreed on a deal that will make Sather the team's new president and general manager, two National Hockey League officials said yesterday. A formal announcement is expected within a week.</p>
        <p>When reached at his La Quinta, Calif., residence, last night, Sather would neither confirm nor deny that a deal was done. The 56-year-old Sather would succeed his friend, Neil Smith, who was fired, along with Coach John Muckler on March 28.</p>
        <p>Sather resigned as president and general manager of the Edmonton Oilers on May 19 after 24 years with the organization. One of his first moves is expected to be the re-signing of Mark Messier, who is expected to become a free agent July 1.</p>
        <p>Another move that Sather could make is bringing in Coach Kevin Lowe, who completed his first season behind the Edmonton bench, to coach the Rangers. Lowe has an offer on the table from the 37-man group that owns the Oilers to succeed Sather as Edmonton's general manager. But Lowe has apparently not decided whether he wants to move from behind the bench.</p>
        <p>The Edmonton assistant coach Craig MacTavish is also a free agent. But MacTavish has recently expressed doubt that he, Lowe and Sather will all end up in New York.</p>
