        <p>JOAN HAMBURG, the talk show host on radio station WOR, had not eaten beets since she was a child, until  she encountered them a few weeks ago at Blue Hill in Greenwich Village. ''Some people have phobias about bridges, some about elevators,'' she said. ''I had a beet phobia.'' Yet, when she didn't recognize her nemesis hidden in beet ravioli with her braised cod, she ate it and discovered: ''It was spectacular. I may have gotten over my phobia.''</p>
        <p>That kind of conversion is not so unusual lately, as a vegetable generally perceived as a winter staple actually comes into season, and in colors, sizes and shapes that beet phobics, reared on the canned kind, could never imagine. Mention the word ''beets,'' and New Yorkers who once might have shuddered now rhapsodize about the last beet mousseline and asparagus salad they had at Tocqueville off Union Square or about the halibut with warm  baby beets in herbed vinaigrette at Bayard's in the financial district. Chefs are now showcasing beets just about every way but the cliche of pickled and sliced.</p>
        <p>Beets are bursting out all over, not only in the traditional deep red, but also in yellow, pink, white, purple and even red-and-white striped, the kind known as candy cane or Chioggia. Picholine near Lincoln Center is serving red beet tartare with caviar; Judson Grill in Midtown pairs candy cane beets with black cod and horseradish oil; and Chanterelle in TriBeCa is even teaming foie gras with a beet vinaigrette and beet greens.</p>
        <p>Chefs are choosing beets not only for the deep rich color and firm, slightly crunchy texture, but also for the sweet earthiness, which varies with type. Chioggia is not only the sweetest, but certainly the most surprising looking. Traditional red beets are next on the sweetness scale, and their intense color makes a wonderful foil for black caviar. Golden beets provide typical beet texture and color but only the barest hint of beet flavor, so subtle that it disappears when mixed with an herbed vinaigrette.</p>
        <p>Beets are following the fashionable pattern of purple potatoes, heirloom tomatoes and golden raspberries. These heirloom varieties, long lost in the quest for standardized fruits and vegetables, until small farmers began growing them again, have helped make the beets more appealing, and not one of them has ever seen the inside of a can.</p>
        <p>''There's a big difference between a beet pickled and put in a can and something fresh from the garden with the brightness of fresh flavor,'' said Kevin Penner, the chef at Della Femina in Midtown. He proves the point with a terrine layering sweet roasted beets with tangy goat cheese fondue.</p>
        <p>Farmers' markets can take a lot of credit for turning beets into a sought-after commodity by piquing the interest of chefs. ''Beets are becoming more popular, because the Greenmarkets have made people more aware of fresh produce,'' said Marco Moreira of Tocqueville.</p>
        <p>In the next few weeks, local beets will be available in New York at the Greenmarkets, from farmers like Guy Jones from Blooming Hill Organic Farm in Blooming Hill, N.Y., who sells organic golden beets, white beets, Chioggia and several varieties of red beets on Fridays at Union Square. In the meantime, red beets are available everywhere, and Gourmet Garage stores often have the golden and Chioggia types as well.</p>
        <p>Alice Waters of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., was a pioneer in the beet revival. She said she was turned on to the many varieties 20 years ago when one of her suppliers started sending them. ''Initially, we loved the colors,'' Ms. Waters said. ''They were so shocking to people, and it's great to have fruits and vegetables that capture your attention.''</p>
        <p>Chez Panisse is a restaurant where the patrons naturally accede to the whims of the chef, which has only helped with beets.  ''They never send beets back,'' Ms. Waters  said, ''and if they did, I would go out there and tell them to eat them.''</p>
        <p>Today, Chez Panisse is serving sweet, firm beets in a salad with creamy avocados and a sharp citrus vinaigrette. Like Ms. Waters, most New York chefs are devising dishes that play to that sweet earthiness and firm texture. All are far removed from the old-fashioned red-flannel hash with beets,  Harvard beets sweetened with orange juice or plain boiled beets. At Esca in the theater district, well-herbed red beets provide the perfect contrast to the buttery and fresh ocean taste of salmon tartare. At Danube in TriBeCa, the Austrian chef Mario Lohninger has three beet dishes on the menu, including very thinly sliced red beets seared in walnut and hazelnut oils and flavored with Champagne vinegar, horseradish and caraway and coriander seeds. ''You have never experienced beets until you have eaten them this way,'' said the chef, whose native cuisine relies heavily on beets.</p>
        <p>Beets, which are native to a wide swath of Eurasia, from Britain to India, have probably always had an image problem. (Their botanical name, beta vulgaris, doesn't help.) Harold McGee, the food scientist and author, said beet greens were probably eaten before the roots ever were, although beets have been eaten since prehistoric times.</p>
        <p>Today, most chefs are bringing out better flavor in beets by bypassing the traditional pot of boiling water. Beets are generally roasted in their skins, at 375 to 400 degrees. Some chefs, like Mr. Lohninger, roast them for four or five hours; others for as little as an hour. Those who opt for the long roasting say it concentrates the sweetness, which also depends on the growing conditions and the age of the beets. Baby beets are so tender they can be eaten skins and all.</p>
        <p>Joan Hamburg notwithstanding, beets are still not universally admired. Dan Barber, an owner of Blue Hill, said the restaurant recently introduced what it thought was a great early spring combination of pork loin and warm beet salad. ''Most of the waiters said people skipped right over it when they saw the beets,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Barber said: ''We're definitely going to bring them back when the farmers are ready. There's a part of me that wants people to see the beauty of them, especially when they are babies and filled with sugar.''</p>
        <p>For now, he knows to camouflage them in ravioli.</p>
        <p>AVOCADO AND BEET SALAD WITH CITRUS VINAIGRETTE  Adapted from ''The Chez Panisse Cafe Cookbook'' (HarperCollins, 1999)  Time: 1 hour 30 minutes</p>
        <p>6 medium red or golden beets  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 tablespoon red wine vinegar  1 tablespoon, plus  3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil  1 large shallot, finely diced  2 tablespoons white wine vinegar  1 tablespoon lemon juice  1 tablespoon orange juice  1 tablespoon chopped chervil, plus sprigs for garnish</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon lemon zest</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon orange zest  2 firm, ripe avocados.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Trim and wash beets, and put them in a baking dish. Add a splash of water, and cover tightly. Roast 45 to 60 minutes, until tender.</p>
        <p>2. Let beets cool, then peel and cut into wedges. Place in bowl, and season with salt and pepper; add red wine vinegar and 1 tablespoon olive oil, and toss gently.</p>
        <p>3. Combine shallots with white wine vinegar, lemon and orange juices and pinch of salt. Macerate 15 minutes. Whisk in  3/4 cup olive oil, and stir in chervil and zest. Adjust seasonings.</p>
        <p>4. Cut avocados in half lengthwise, and remove pits. Leaving skin intact, cut avocados lengthwise into  1/4-inch-thick slices. Scoop out slices with a large spoon, and arrange on a platter or individual dishes. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange beets on top, and drizzle with shallot mixture. Garnish with chervil sprigs.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>ROASTED RED BEET AND GOAT CHEESE TERRINE Adapted from Della Femina  Time: 50 minutes, plus 2 hours' roasting time and at least 2 hours' chilling time</p>
        <p>4 red beets, about baseball size, trimmed  2 pounds soft goat cheese  4 teaspoons minced thyme  4 teaspoons minced rosemary  1 1/2 tablespoons black truffle oil  Salt and fresh black pepper.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Wrap beets in heavy foil. Roast until easily pierced with a knife, about 2 hours. Cool, then rub off skins with paper towel.</p>
        <p>2. Using a mandoline or sharp knife, slice beets as thin as possible. Line an 11-by-3 1/2-by-3-inch terrine with plastic wrap. Line bottom and sides with beet slices, overlapping slightly.</p>
        <p>3. Melt goat cheese in double boiler or bowl set over simmering water. Transfer to food processor, and add thyme, rosemary, truffle oil and salt and pepper to taste. Process until smooth.</p>
        <p>4. Place goat cheese in a pastry bag without a tip (or use two large spoons), and pipe into mold. Smooth mixture, and top with layer of beet slices. Press gently on top to flatten and compress. Trim any slices that extend above top, to make neat edge. Cover, and refrigerate at least 2 hours, up to two days.</p>
        <p>5. To serve, invert chilled terrine onto a plate and remove plastic wrap. Cut terrine into 16 slices, and allow to come to room temperature. Place two slices on each of eight serving plates, accompanied by a mache salad if desired.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 servings.</p>
        <p>SEARED BEETS  Adapted from Danube  Time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon hazelnut oil  1 tablespoon walnut oil  1 tablespoon canola oil  4 beets, a little smaller than a tennis ball, sliced less than 1/16 inch thick  Salt and pepper to taste</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon caraway seeds</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon crushed coriander seeds  1 1/2 teaspoons firmly packed, finely grated fresh horseradish  1 1/2 tablespoons Champagne vinegar.</p>
        <p>1. In heavy pan, heat all oils until almost smoking. Stir in beets, and cook over high heat, stirring, until coated with oil.</p>
        <p>2. Reduce heat to medium. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in caraway and coriander seeds. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until beets begin to caramelize and become quite soft, about 20 minutes. If they dry out, add a little more canola oil.</p>
        <p>3. Remove from heat, and stir in horseradish and vinegar and at least 2 to 3 tablespoons water. Stir vigorously to scrape up stickiness on bottom of pan. Mixture should not be dry. Adjust seasonings, and cool to room temperature. Serve immediately, or  refrigerate and return to room temperature  one hour before serving. Serve over mesclun or alongside smoked fish.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>SALMON AND BEET TARTARE Adapted from Esca  Time: 1 1/2 hours, plus 1 hour for roasting the beets</p>
        <p>4 medium beets, washed and trimmed  1 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh chives  1 1/2 teaspoons minced tarragon  1 teaspoon Dijon mustard  3 teaspoons finely chopped shallots  6 teaspoons lemon juice  3 drops Tabasco sauce  2 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  8 ounces skinned salmon fillet, cut into very small dice  1 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh parsley  Pea shoots for garnish, optional.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Place beets in small roasting pan with  1/2 cup water.  Cover, and cook until tender when pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Cool, then peel and cut into very fine dice.</p>
        <p>2. In a bowl, combine beets with  3/4 teaspoon  chives,  3/4 teaspoon tarragon,  1/2 teaspoon mustard and 1 1/2 teaspoons shallots. Add 4 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice, Tabasco and 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil. Mix well, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate.</p>
        <p>3. In a medium mixing bowl, combine salmon, remaining chives, tarragon and shallots.  Add parsley and remaining mustard and lemon. Add remaining oil, and season to taste. Mix well, cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.</p>
        <p>4. To assemble: On each of four serving plates, place  1/4 of the beet tartare in the bottom of a 3-inch ring mold. Top with an even layer of  1/4 of the salmon tartare. Pat gently to compress. Remove ring molds, and garnish with pea shoots if desired.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
