        <p>James M. Strauss does not consider himself a wimp. But Mr. Strauss, a Manhattan lawyer, was not going to take an extended leave of absence when his son Evan was born last June. One of the reasons: He feared that his co-workers would question his machismo.</p>
        <p>''If I had said that I was planning to take more than two weeks off, people would have looked at me askance,'' said Mr. Strauss, an associate at Putney, Twombly, Hall &amp; Hirson. Instead, he took just three days of vacation to help his wife with their newborn. ''There's definitely a perception out there that child care is a burden that's still expected to fall on women,'' Mr. Strauss said.</p>

        <p>James M. Strauss does not consider himself a wimp. But Mr. Strauss, a Manhattan lawyer, was not going to take an extended leave of absence when his son Evan was born last June. One of the reasons: He feared that his co-workers would question his machismo.</p>
        <p>''If I had said that I was planning to take more than two weeks off, people would have looked at me askance,'' said Mr. Strauss, an associate at Putney, Twombly, Hall &amp; Hirson. Instead, he took just three days of vacation to help his wife with their newborn. ''There's definitely a perception out there that child care is a burden that's still expected to fall on women,'' Mr. Strauss said.</p>
        <p>Though it has been seven years since Congress signed the Family and Medical Leave Act, which requires companies with more than 50 employees to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for new parents, most men do not take advantage of this legal right. Some decline for economic reasons, but for others, it is fear that keeps them in the workplace -- fear of being ridiculed, fear of being discriminated against, even fear of losing their jobs -- some specialists say.</p>
        <p>''Men are terrified to take parental leave,'' said Suzanne Braun Levine, a former editor of Ms. Magazine and author of ''Father Courage: What Happens When Men Put Family First'' (Harcourt, 2000). ''While their organizations may profess to be family friendly, their bosses are giving them the message that men who take leave are not very manly, or are somehow letting down the team.''</p>
        <p>That's the message that a former South Carolina state trooper, David Roberts, says he got when he asked for six weeks off to care for his newborn daughter Cindy in 1996. Mr. Roberts, who had been with the state police nine years at the time, says he made the request because his wife was still in nursing school. He says his superiors responded by telling him that ''a man's job was to work, not stay home with the kids.''</p>
        <p>''One of my bosses told me this long story about how he had never let his wife work -- even though they had so little money that they had to eat beanie weenies to make ends meet,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''Basically, he said I was less of a man for wanting to care for my child.'' Mr. Roberts said he was intimidated into withdrawing his request and was later dismissed in retaliation for making it in the first place.</p>
        <p>Last June, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the South Carolina Department of Public Safety on his behalf. The department's lawyer, Vance J. Bettis, has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, and said that Mr. Roberts's accusations ''just aren't true.''</p>
        <p>The former trooper, Mr. Bettis said, ''was terminated for reasons unrelated to his requesting leave.''</p>
        <p>In a strikingly similar case, also brought by the A.C.L.U., a jury awarded a former Maryland state trooper, Kevin Knussman, $375,000 in February 1999 for the first-ever sex-discrimination verdict in conjunction with the 1993 federal family leave law. Mr. Knussman contends that his supervisors told him that ''God made women to breast-feed babies, and men can't fulfill that role.'' That case is being appealed, and Betty Stemley Sconion, principal counsel for the Maryland State Police, says that Mr. Knussman was not discriminated against. ''He made a mountain out of a molehill,'' Ms. Stemley Sconion said. ''His superiors made an attempt to accommodate his request for leave.''</p>
        <p>Sara Mandelbaum, a Manhattan lawyer who represents both Mr. Roberts and Mr. Knussman for the A.C.L.U., says accusations of bias against family-oriented fathers is not confined to blue-collar male bastions like law enforcement. ''We hear about situations like this all the time in the white-collar world, although sometimes the message is more subtle,'' Ms. Mandelbaum said. 'I often hear from men on Wall Street, or from lawyers, who say their bosses have hinted that they wouldn't get promoted if they took an extended leave for nurturing purposes.'</p>
        <p>Paula Rayman, director of the Radcliffe Public Policy Center, which studies workplace issues, says a Harvard professor recently confided that his boss told him he would never get tenure if he took time out from work to care for a new baby.</p>
        <p>''Companies like to put on a family-friendly front,'' Ms. Rayman said, ''but behind the scenes, managers are sending out a totally different message.''</p>
        <p>In researching her book, Ms. Braun Levine says she interviewed a human resources manager for a major company who said he advised male colleagues to take a combination of sick leave and vacation time to avoid having the words ''parental leave'' emblazoned in their employee records. ''He seemed to feel that taking paternity leave would be a strike against you,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Even at some companies where parental leave is encouraged, human resources managers say they see few male takers. ''Very few men here take more than a week off for the birth of a baby, and usually, they just use vacation time,'' said Donna Klein, a vice president at Marriott International in Bethesda, Md. ''If you're a man, there's still somewhat of a stigma attached to taking paternity leave per se.''</p>
        <p>The only companies that see larger numbers of men taking parental leave are the ones that offer paid leave -- and even there, senior executives have to set an example first, according to workplace experts.</p>
        <p>''It makes a big difference if you've got a manager to lead the way,'' said Marcia Brumit Kropf, vice president for research and information services for Catalyst, a New York-based research group that studies women's issues.</p>
        <p>Such a manager may have made the difference for Joseph J. Kelleher, an associate at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy, a Manhattan law firm that offers both male and female employees a full month of paid leave after the birth of a child. Mr. Kelleher took advantage of the firm's policy after both of his daughters, now 3 and 5, were born. ''I didn't feel funny about it, mainly because there are several folks here who have children and have done the same thing,'' Mr. Kelleher said.</p>
        <p>According to Christine Wagner, director of legal personnel for the firm, more than 80 percent of eligible men have taken advantage of the policy since its inception in 1993, including several partners. But Ms. Wagner knows her firm is in the minority.</p>
        <p>''A lot of firms offer some kind of leave policy, but their managers don't walk the talk,'' she said. ''Here, our male partners did -- and it's really opened the floodgates.''</p>
