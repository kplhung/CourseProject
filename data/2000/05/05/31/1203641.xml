        <p>It doesn't rise to the level of ''Shakespeare in Love'' versus ''Saving Private Ryan,'' but the competition before the Tony Awards on Sunday night nevertheless amounts to what producers call Tony madness, a frenzy of promoting, politicking and nitpicking by Broadway producers aimed at winning votes from the 705 voting theater people that can mean the difference between millions in losses, even a closing, and a show with legs.</p>
        <p>The splashy, celebratory publicity events in this period -- the nominees' brunch at Sardi's, the photo op on the stairs of Radio City Music Hall, where the awards will take place -- mask the bottom-line desperation of producers to see their shows win best play or best musical, the only two awards that they say affect the box office.</p>
        <p>Because a Tony in those categories can lure tourists in New York and ensure solid runs on the road, producers pull out all the stops they can for their shows: spending as much as $250,000 to advertise a show with a good chance of winning best musical, trying to book television appearances and in some cases picking up the telephone to cajole Tony voters they know.</p>
        <p>While the awards in other categories amount to little financially, producers say, they promote those nominees anyway, in part to get whatever attention they can from Tony voters but mostly because they have no choice. There is an unspoken expectation that producers will put promotional money behind the people in their productions who have been nominated. The importance of that factor was made starkly clear when Patrick Stewart announced from the stage of ''The Ride Down Mount Morgan'' this month that the Shubert Organization was inadequately promoting the show. (The producers answered by filing charges with the Actors' Equity Association, which ruled that Mr. Stewart had to write an apology.)</p>
        <p>Some suggested that the timing of Mr. Stewart's curtain speech just before the nominations amounted to a personal Tony campaign. Although awards for best actor or best actress may not sell tickets, they have been known to enhance careers.</p>
        <p>For a few shows this season the awards are a matter of life and death. ''The Wild Party,'' the new musical by George C. Wolfe and Michael John LaChiusa, was gasping for breath when it was nominated for best musical. It was selling only 50 percent of its tickets, and there was some question whether the producers would keep it running even after a nomination. They did.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Wolfe, the artistic director of the Joseph Papp Public Theater, which is the lead producer of the show, an award would also be a vindication (given the show's mixed reviews, including a negative one in The New York Times) and a validation of his decision to gamble big on Broadway again as he did last season with the unsuccessful revival of ''On the Town.'' If ''Wild Party'' doesn't win, however, there is some question about whether it will have built enough word of mouth to keep running.</p>
        <p>''Wild Party'' is considered the main competition for best musical facing ''Contact,'' Susan Stroman's acclaimed dance show -- given that ''James Joyce's 'The Dead' '' has closed and ''Swing!'' is generally considered a weak contender because of its lukewarm reviews. Though favored to win, ''Contact'' would be a shoo-in if it weren't for some fierce opposition to the show's being considered a musical because it has no singing, original music or live orchestra.</p>
        <p>The musicians' union, Local 802, has objected to the decision to make the show eligible for the best musical award. Jack Goldstein, the executive director of the Theater Development Fund, which runs TKTS and theater support programs, resigned from the Tony nominating committee to protest its inclusion.</p>
        <p>But ''Contact'' is not alone this season in challenging traditional notions of what constitutes a book musical. ''The Dead,'' which features Irish parlor songs, and ''Swing!,'' a dance revue, also defy the conventional definition. And these shows follow seasons of shows like ''Fosse,'' a dance revue that won best musical last year, and ''Smokey Joe's Cafe,'' a revue that had a long run largely because one of its numbers was performed on the Tony Awards show, which can offer invaluable national exposure.</p>
        <p>Bernard Gersten, executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater, which produced ''Contact,'' said he was outraged by the objections. ''They are the forces of darkness, those who have argued that it is not a musical,'' he said. ''The music is no less original to what it was originally made for than the music in 'Swing!'</p>
        <p>''Nobody objects to 'Fosse' because it doesn't have new music,'' Mr. Gersten continued. ''Suddenly we don't have a musical score.''</p>
        <p>This year members of the nominating committee -- a 24-member group that can include performers, composers, educators and others involved in the theater -- seem particularly dismayed that the Tony Administration Committee ruled on questions of eligibility and that the nominators' views were not taken into account. The administration committee is made up of members of the League of American Theaters and Producers and of the American Theater Wing, which jointly present the awards.</p>
        <p>In his resignation letter, Mr. Goldstein of the Theater Development Fund cited a letter he wrote last fall in which he suggested that the administration committee brief the nominators after eligibility petitions had been submitted but before making its decision public. Another suggestion was to establish a Tony for Innovation ''to recognize evolving theatrical forms, new technical advancements or any creative approach to theater.'' Neither suggestion was adopted.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the playwright A. R. Gurney, who resigned from the nominating committee this year because he was not allowed to abstain from votes in which he felt ill equipped to take part, said he felt frustrated by the fruitlessness of the nominators' attempts to make their concerns heard. ''We were told to write letters, and the problems would be addressed,'' Mr. Gurney said. ''That was in September. Then they said we'll talk about it in January. Then they said after we voted.</p>
        <p>''There is this rolling of the eyes when we meet because there doesn't seem to be any opportunity to discuss things.''</p>
        <p>The nominators were invited to such a discussion on May 18 with members of the administration committee. It was partly in response to that meeting that the committee voted on May 23 to establish a new category next season for special theatrical events.</p>
        <p>''There actually seems to be a rough justice to all of this,'' said Edgar Dobie, managing producer of the Tonys.</p>
        <p>While producers say they don't pressure Tony voters, they certainly call their friends. ''You get those who are calling everybody, trying to collect favors for a quid pro quo,'' said one producer who refused to be identified. ''It's a secret ballot, so you never know whether they kept their word or not.''</p>
        <p>The producer Rocco Landesman, said he might, for example, call the producer Michael David if they don't both have shows competing in the same category. ''I might well say to him, 'Moon for the Misbegotten' is in the best play category, don't forget,'' Mr. Landesman said. ''Producers tend to call their friends, and friends are reassuring. And generally, people do vote with their friends.''</p>
        <p>Then there is the more tentative nudging that producers do, sending special tchotchkes in the mail along with keep-us-in-mind notes. On the theory that people remember best what they saw last, the producers of ''Kiss Me, Kate'' are nervous that their show, which opened in the fall, is at a disadvantage against ''The Music Man,'' which opened in April. As a result, Tony voters have received the cast CD and a souvenir program and have been invited to return to ''Kate'' as a guest of the producers ''to get a fresh look,'' said Roger Berlind, who produced it with Roger Horchow.</p>
        <p>A frustration for many producers in Tony season is that many voters give their free tickets to friends or don't use their tickets at all, but vote anyway. This has long been a problem. In 1996 The New York Times informally surveyed 17 voters, including producers and other theater people, and found that 13 acknowledged having missed one or both of two best-musical nominees that had already closed, ''Chronicle of a Death Foretold'' and ''Swinging on a Star.''</p>
        <p>While the tickets are supposed to be nonstransferable, producers say they are reluctant to enforce this rule by demanding identification from those who pick up the tickets for fear of creating ill will and losing votes.</p>
        <p>The producers of ''True West'' are upset that the two leads who share roles are competing against each other because the Tony committee denied the producers' request to have them considered jointly. But ''True West'' seems unlikely to be hurt if neither star wins because of the prominence of its two stars, Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly, who are known for their film work. And the producers are promoting both actors equally.</p>
        <p>Rosie O'Donnell, a staunch supporter of theater, has featured them on her show along with the actress Blair Brown of ''Copenhagen,'' who is also well known for her television series ''The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd.''</p>
        <p>Generally, however, producers of straight plays say they are paralyzed on the publicity front during the pre-Tony period and have to let the work speak for itself. ''We don't have a souvenir program, we have a play,'' said Mr. Berlind of ''Copenhagen,'' which he also helped produce (along with ''The Wild Party'' and ''The Ride Down Mount Morgan''). ''We hope they come. There's not much we can do beyond that that is not obviously self-serving and inappropriate to the seriousness of the play.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, the shows that are no longer running say they have little choice but to sit tight, that pouring money into promotion would be money lost. ''No, we are not launching a P.R. offensive,'' said Gregory Mosher, a producer of ''The Dead.'' ''What are we going to do, take everybody out on a boat?''</p>
        <p>It isn't that ''The Dead'' is actually dead; it will open at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles in July and then tour the country. But it would be foolish, Mr. Mosher say, to expect much out of the nomination period because the show has already left Broadway. ''It's like an indie film competing against 'Mission: Impossible 2.' ''</p>
        <p>Similarly, shows that were shut out of the nominations -- like ''Saturday Night Fever'' -- or that only drew a few nominations, like ''The Green Bird,'' have to work doubly hard to stay alive, particularly without a musical number on the broadcast, which has been known to be decisive. Already there have been casualties: ''Waiting in the Wings'' closed on Sunday and ''Taller Than a Dwarf'' is closing on June 11.</p>
        <p>Shows that were scheduled as limited runs to begin with -- like ''A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' ''Uncle Vanya'' and ''The Real Thing'' -- are expected simply to play out to the end, though Tony Awards can sometimes mean extensions.</p>
        <p>In the end, after all the jockeying and marketing, producers say there is only one thing left to do. Anita Waxman, who helped produce four nominated shows this season -- ''A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' ''The Real Thing,'' ''The Wild Party'' and ''The Music Man'' -- summed it up: ''Pray.''</p>
