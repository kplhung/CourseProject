        <p>In October 1998, Cynthia Marquez was suspected of child abuse after her son Juan, a 10-year-old who takes six pills a day to temper his behavioral problems, pummeled a younger brother, leaving bruises on his arms. School officials called in a complaint to the state hot line, and a city child welfare investigator appeared at her Brooklyn apartment, inspecting her kitchen cupboards and questioning her children.</p>
        <p>Nine days later, after the charges had been declared unfounded, the case was closed. But the memory lingered.</p>
        <p>And so one recent evening, after  Juan started misbehaving again -- screaming, hurling things in the apartment, pushing his younger siblings -- Ms. Marquez, a slight woman weighing barely 100 pounds, considered dialing 911, but stopped short. What if, she wondered, the police call the child welfare agency on her for failing to protect her other children?</p>
        <p>She called no one. Juan calmed down. But the disquieting choice that Ms. Marquez, 26, faced that evening underscored a larger, complicated fact of family life in Bushwick and other neighborhoods like it across the city. There, where the Administration for Children's Services is regarded as a potent, ubiquitous presence, there is a real everyday fear that a momentary crisis can become something worse. That a parental mistake can lead to an investigation. Or that in the nightmare case, a difficult child can be taken away.</p>
        <p>Every day, Ms. Marquez says, she worries about the consequences of her troubled boy's temper tantrums and horseplay. ''Problem is, you call 911, and B.C.W. is coming to take your other kids away,'' she said, referring to the child agency, like most other parents here, by its old name, short for the Bureau of Child Welfare. ''Every day, he plays rough. If something happens, B.C.W. is there.''</p>
        <p>That kind of fear -- whether well founded or excessive -- is the product of a tangled mix of circumstance and public policy. There is, after all, a very real problem of child abuse and neglect in this and other poor neighborhoods, where drug abuse, violence and the everyday stresses of poverty have taken a heavy toll on family life and made frequent visitors of child protective workers.</p>
        <p>Today, 20 out of every 1,000 children in Bushwick are in the city's protective custody, a rate 10 times as high as it is in the Upper East Side of Manhattan and seven times what it is in solidly middle-class Bayside, Queens, according to city figures. And in Bushwick, there were 1,413 investigations of neglect or abuse complaints in 1998, the most recent year for which statistics are available, while there were only 109 on the Upper East Side.</p>
        <p>If the stakes are high for Bushwick parents, so, too, are they for the city. The next flawed investigation could be the next high-profile tragedy, and the city, which has stepped up enforcement in recent years, has been alternately criticized for sometimes failing to spot children in grave danger and at other times for removing children far too rashly.</p>
        <p>That combustible combination of children at risk and an oversight agency under pressure not to slip up can create an atmosphere in which a wide range of parents -- some good, some bad, some in between and stressed out -- alter their conduct, color their conversations and have the frankest of strategic conversations with their children, all because they worry about their first or next encounter with the child protective agency.</p>
        <p>Parents in Bushwick talk with dread about the possibility that missing eyeglasses or a broken arm could result in accusations of child abuse. Some carry documents clearing them of child abuse charges in case they find themselves being questioned by a caseworker. They tell one another to always have a doctor's note for school absences. They warn their children about what can happen if they tell tall tales at school.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marquez keeps receipts showing that she has been to the food pantry when her cupboards run bare. ''I have to protect myself,'' she said simply.</p>
        <p>Historically, anywhere from two-thirds to three-quarters of the tens of thousands of reports of possible neglect or abuse investigated by the city's child welfare agency every year turn out to be unwarranted. And while parents in Bushwick say vigilance in reporting concerns is a good thing, they feel they are living out every parenting move under suspicion.</p>
        <p>Such suspicions and fear that abound in a neighborhood like Bushwick do not make things easier for the agency's caseworkers.</p>
        <p>''In poor neighborhoods, people get reported more often,'' said Faye Moore, a former child protective worker in Brooklyn and now a vice president for Local 371, the union that represents the city's caseworkers. ''In neighborhoods where there are more reports, there is mistrust of the agency. We walk in knowing we're not trusted.''</p>
        <p>Sitting along the Brooklyn-Queens border, Bushwick is among the city's poorest neighborhoods. Nine out of 10 children in the school district here live below the federal poverty line. A majority of residents are blacks and Latinos, and growing numbers among them are newcomers from Mexico and the Dominican Republic, with little or no ability to communicate in English.</p>
        <p>In the neighborhood's schoolyards and bodegas, on tenement stoops and in community meetings, parents  trade tales about their own encounters with the agency. Some are true; others are bits of scary folklore. All, while hard to definitively confirm, stoke the very real emotional stress of the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marquez says she has heard of a mother who was reported for neglect because her son's school uniform was not properly pressed.</p>
        <p>Nieves Padilla, 43, a single mother of four teenagers in the Hope Gardens housing project, had a social worker arrive at her door, she contends, because she refused to sign papers authorizing her daughter to be placed in special education. The charges, brought in 1991, were ultimately dropped, according to papers that Ms. Padilla still takes with her to school meetings.</p>
        <p>Nery Mejia said her daughter, then 5, suffered a gash below her eye during a squabble over a Barney stuffed toy several years ago. Ms. Mejia wound up with a child abuse case against her after a school official reported it to the state central register.</p>
        <p>The city cannot confirm or deny either Ms. Mejia's or Ms. Padilla's version of events because they both occurred at a time when charges ultimately deemed to be unwarranted were expunged from the record. Under a new law passed after the 1995 killing of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo, case files are now maintained even if charges are dropped. Elisa was beaten to death by her mother, whom the city had long suspected of child abuse and neglect. T</p>
        <p>By Ms. Mejia's account, she spent months after the investigation sleeping at her daughter's side, reassuring the child, and apparently herself as well, that nothing would come between them. ''I was scared one day they'd come and take my daughter,'' she recalled.</p>
        <p>Ms. Padilla wondered aloud whether there was a financial incentive for calling in a complaint to the state child abuse register. ''I don't know if the teacher gets some money!'' she suggested, rolling her eyes to the sky.</p>
        <p>They do not.</p>
        <p>State law mandates that school personnel call the state hot line if they suspect abuse or neglect. No proof is required, just reasonable cause for suspicion. Failing to call, if they know a child is being mistreated, is a misdemeanor.</p>
        <p>The law accords considerable discretion to school officials, said Joshua Marquez, the Board of Education's coordinator for child abuse and neglect prevention. ''The law requires them to file a report whenever they have reasonable cause to suspect, based on their training, based on what they've observed, based on their familiarity with the child,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In New York City, schools are the largest source of child abuse complaints: a third of all calls to the state central register come from school personnel, according to city officials. And within the city, Mr. Marquez estimated, a higher share come from school officials in poor neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>That, he said, understandably can create tension between parents and the school system. ''The school is then labeled as a contributor to this whole child protective system,'' he said. But, he added: ''We're not accusing the parent. We are trying to ensure the safety and welfare of the youngster.''</p>
        <p>That, as Ms. Moore well remembers from her visits throughout Brooklyn, can be a delicate balance. In more affluent communities, school officials and others who spot something suspicious are more likely to discuss it with the family before calling the government. In Bushwick, she says, that may not always happen.</p>
        <p>For their part, Administration for Children's Services officials point out that their investigations are naturally concentrated in neighborhoods where most of the complaints come from. At the top of the list are Central and East Harlem, a cluster of neighborhoods in the South Bronx, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Brownsville in Brooklyn, followed by neighborhoods like Jamaica, Queens, the Lower East Side of Manhattan and Bushwick.</p>
        <p>''By law we must investigate all reports made to the state central registry regardless of their neighborhood of origin,'' said an agency spokeswoman, Jennifer Falk.</p>
        <p>At the same time, acknowledging the longstanding lack of trust in many of those same communities, she said, administration officials are working to ''dispel some of the misconceptions of the agency.'' Foster children, she noted, are now placed in their home neighborhoods, instead of being taken away to a far-flung corner of the city. Caseworkers are now assigned to a particular cluster of neighborhoods, so they do not seem like foreign faces.</p>
        <p>For now, in Bushwick, fear still runs high. Parents speak of their encounters with the agency as though they were speaking of law enforcement. Classes on how to be a good parent are referred to as probation, while a complaint filed with the child abuse register is likened to having a record that can haunt one later.</p>
        <p>''It's a record that's going to be there,'' Ms. Padilla said. ''If something happens in the future, it's there forever.''</p>
        <p>That leeriness carries an additional danger. It can, says Andrew Friedman, a community organizer in Bushwick, keep parents who may be in fact struggling with their children from turning to the very institution designed to help families in trouble -- the child welfare agency.</p>
        <p>''It ends up being a menacing presence rather than a helpful presence in the rare instances where they're needed,'' said Mr. Friedman, co-director of Make the Road by Walking, a storefront group that advocates on behalf of Bushwick's poor. ''It's a power that's not on their side, that's distrustful of them.''</p>
