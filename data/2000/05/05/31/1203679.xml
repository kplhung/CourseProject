        <p>LARRY BRILLIANT, one hand wrapped around a cold can of Coke on his desk at SoftNet Systems Inc., was describing a way of life that most people might regard as road torture.</p>
        <p>''These are people traveling on business all the time, working like maniacs, an average of 2.4 separate visits each week to an airport, where they spend an average of two hours each trip,'' he said.</p>
        <p>I see this as cause to notify Amnesty International, but Dr. Brilliant, a  physician who got into the computer world as an early investor in Apple Computer, sees it as his major market. These potential customers, he said, are the creme de la creme among the estimated 30 million business travelers around the world who belong to a group that fits his following general description: ''They're price-insensitive, time-sensitive and on the road constantly.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Brilliant is the chairman and chief executive of SoftNet, whose businesses include providing broadband Internet technology for cable systems. Recently, SoftNet, with partners including Nokia, Compaq Computer and Cisco Systems, sank $100 million into a subsidiary, SoftNet Zone, which is planning in the fall to start a system of local area wireless networks in airports, hotels and convention centers that will provide high-speed Internet service and e-mail access for business travelers on the move.</p>
        <p>As a part of that initiative, SoftNet and Delta Air Lines announced a deal last month to set up centers for Delta customers to gain access to the Internet, as well as their corporate intranets and e-mail systems. Delta plans to begin this service later this year, starting at its hub airports in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Salt lake City and Dallas-Fort Worth.</p>
        <p>I arrived at Softnet's headquarters in San Francisco's booming dot-com district recently through a circuitous route. Back in February, on a layover at the Tampa International Airport in Florida, I had spent a very productive hour working at a storefront business center called Laptop Lane, which rents private office cubicles with desks, phones and computers offering high-speed Internet service.</p>
        <p>This struck me as a spectacular innovation, being able to rent a private office -- I paid $2 for the first five minutes and 38 cents for each additional minute -- in a place as invincibly dismal as an airport. The parent company, Laptop Lane Ltd., had said it would open outlets in 80 airports worldwide within two years.</p>
        <p>But by the time I got home and called Laptop Lane, the company had been acquired by Dr. Brilliant's SoftNet for $45 million. Dr. Brilliant and backers like Nokia, it turned out, had an even more ambitious idea: use Laptop Lane's hard-won airport real estate as a base for SoftNet's plan to sell wireless and wired high-speed Internet connections to business travelers on the go. Until Laptop Lane entered the picture, SoftNet had been thinking that hotels would be the main anchor for its local-network Internet services.</p>
        <p>Dr. Brilliant said that he visited his first Laptop Lane only about 10 months ago, and began to see the possibilities. ''I was stranded at O'Hare and I bumped into this Laptop Lane,'' he recalled. ''Man, I was hooked. This was my own room. I was paying for it. I made a conference call and took my shoes off.'' He added that as a business traveler he belonged to all of the major airline premium clubs, but ''in those clubs, you're never that comfortable working; you always feel like the person behind you is waiting for you to get out of the way.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Laptop lane was limited by physical space, even as the number of outlets increased.</p>
        <p>''At the Atlanta airport, 250,000 people circulate every day, and about 80,000 of those are the people Larry is talking about as potential customers,'' said R. Bruce Merrell, the founder and chief executive of Laptop Lane, who was in Dr. Brilliant's office when we talked. ''We have three locations in Atlanta, but they can only accommodate 400 people at any time.''</p>
        <p>What's interesting to me about SoftNet's plan, beyond its world-view audacity, is the practical combination of highflying technology with the most down-to-earth business concept of all, real estate.</p>
        <p>In airports, Laptop Lane outlets will do double duty as customer-service centers for Softnet Zone customers going online at the gate or ''anywhere else you want, including the shoeshine stand and the bathroom,'' Dr. Brilliant said.</p>
        <p>''It's critical to have human beings nearby because things will go wrong with your computer,'' he said. ''They will have technicians who can find you immediately and get you online.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Merrell said that the idea of linking up with an Internet provider that someday expects to sell wireless access directly on airplanes in flight hadn't dampened the enthusiasm for the physical real estate. ''We expect to have Laptop Lanes in the top 60 United States airports and the top 30 international airports within a five-year period,'' he said. ''Since we went in with Softnet, in fact, it's been raining airports.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Brilliant, meanwhile, suggested that Mr. Merrell's original business plan would probably have led the company to expand its businesses through local area networks providing Internet access anywhere in an airport, not just in the limited space of the storefront location.</p>
        <p>''I think they probably could have done this on their own,'' Dr. Brilliant said.</p>
        <p>''Hey, thanks, Larry,'' Mr. Merrell replied, beaming.</p>
        <p>''Provided they had the money,'' Dr. Brilliant added.</p>
