        <p>It is spelled simply enough, in just two syllables, with no strange or gimmicky combinations of letters. But for centuries it has been grievously mispronounced by everyone who is not anyone.</p>
        <p>And no wonder. Why would the average person know that ''Althorp'' is supposed to be pronounced AWL-trupp?</p>
        <p>That is exactly the question Earl Spencer, brother of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the owner of Althorp, the family's impressive ancestral estate next to this tiny village, asked himself recently. In a highly unaristocratic move, the earl announced that ''Althorp'' should henceforth be known the way common people might think it should be known, as AWL-thorp.</p>
        <p>''It seems fitting to change the pronunciation once and for all to a version that everyone can pronounce and understand,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The earl, who particularly wants things to be user-friendly for the tens of thousands of visitors he hopes to attract this summer to the Diana-themed memorial at Althorp, said the word had always given him trouble. Before he inherited his earldom and went by the lowlier title of Viscount Althorp, for instance, he arrived at a new job in New York to find his name listed as ''Al Thorp.''</p>
        <p>But if it was a shot across the bow, Lord Spencer's bold declaration of linguistic democracy does not seem to have unsettled the countless British aristocrats who wear their own flamboyantly semi-pronounceable names, and those of their enormous homes, like badges of honor.</p>
        <p>The Cholmondeley family, for example, was not suddenly moved to declare that from now on they no longer wanted to be called the CHUM-leys. Nor did the Earl of Harewood announce an end to his preferred pronunciation, HAR-wood, either for himself or his estate, Harewood House, even though the adjoining village of Harewood, full of unaristocratic residents, calls itself HAIR-wood.</p>
        <p>And the Beaulieus are still clinging to their traditional style, simple and decidedly un-Frenchified: BEW-ley.</p>
        <p>''I think it's one of those things that either you know or you don't know,'' said an official at Cholmondeley castle, explaining how civilians learn, apparently by osmosis, that the unwieldy name is supposed to be spoken as Chumley. (''No, indeed not,'' she added, when asked whether her name might be used.)</p>
        <p>What gives these people, you might ask, the right to defy the conventions of the alphabet and insist on eccentric pronunciations of their own choosing?</p>
        <p>''All this nonsense is about who's in the club and who's out,'' said Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage. ''There is a tendency in this country to change names around, in order to appeal to the upper classes in a way that doesn't allow the lower classes to pronounce things correctly.''</p>
        <p>Like many things connected to the upper classes in Britain, though, it is more complicated than that. Many of the most aristocratic families in Britain have names that date back many hundreds of years, to a time when words were not always spelled or pronounced as they are now.</p>
        <p>''Part of the problem is that we've been literate for so long,'' said Graham Pointon, a pronunciation adviser in the BBC's pronunciation department. ''The English language has been written down since Anglo-Saxon times. While the pronunciation has moved on, the spelling has lagged behind.''</p>
        <p>In many cases, he said, the pronunciation of long words changed simply because people were sick of having to use so many syllables. Think of how Worcestershire is supposed to be pronounced WUSS-ter-sheer, or how Magdalene, a college in Cambridge, is supposed to be pronounced MAUD-lin.</p>
        <p>''The whole purpose of language is to communicate as much as possible with the least possible effort, so sounds which used to be pronounced are left out over time,'' Mr. Pointon said.</p>
        <p>But in a Britain where people of all stripes are highly attuned to social distinction, the way words are pronounced cannot help separating the wheat from the chaff.</p>
        <p>''It's one of those class distinction indicators that people like to hang onto to show that they're upper class,'' said Robin Harcourt Williams, the librarian at Hatfield House, the home of the very upper-class Cecil (rhymes with thistle) family.</p>
        <p>And changing one's name -- or one's pronunciation -- has long been used by the lower classes to affect a patina of poshness. One of the most popular comic creations on television, for instance, is the character Hyacinth Bucket in ''Keeping Up Appearances,'' who insists that her name be pronounced boo-KAY.</p>
        <p>And many Britons speak fondly of people their parents or grandparents knew who were desperate to save themselves from embarrassing names by inventing exotic pronunciations. That way, for instance, the comical Sidebottoms became the flamboyant sid-AY-bo-TOMS.</p>
        <p>Members of the same family often disagree on how their names should be pronounced.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Powell, Prime Minister Tony Blair's chief of staff, pronounces his last name to rhyme with towel. But his older brother, Sir Charles Powell, a Conservative who was private secretary to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, decided that he wanted to pronounce it in a slightly snootier way, to rhyme with roll -- the usage also favored by the late novelist Anthony Powell. (Mr. Major himself has a brother named Terry Major-Ball, but dropped the ''Ball'' in his own name).</p>
        <p>In Great Brington, where they have always said AWL-thorp, there was general relief at Lord Spencer's announcement.</p>
        <p>''Visitors were always embarrassed when I told them they were mispronouncing it,'' said Christine Whiley, the Great Brington postmistress. ''I'm glad he's finally bowed to public opinion.''</p>
        <p>But Geordie Greig (pronounced gregg), the editor of The Tatler magazine and a keen student of Britain's upper classes, being a member himself, said he was sorry to see the old usage go.</p>
        <p>''I'd always thought I was being incredibly clever, knowing it was AWL-trupp,'' he said, fondly mentioning one of his other favorite words, equerry (pronounced uh-QUAIR-y by those in the know, apparently). ''It was always nice to have thought one was on the inside track, and now we're all left with this lowest-common-denominator word, with everything reduced to its simplest, blandest and most approachable level.''</p>
        <p>Whatever happens, Lord Spencer said, he is sure that people will continue to find ways of getting the name Althorp wrong. When his sister died, he said, one American television station reported that her body was heading to its ''final resting place, at Antwerp.''</p>
