        <p>WHILE strong flavors are in vogue, anchovies seem to have been left behind. Aside from their role in Caesar salad and pizzas, they usually go unbilled and often undetected.</p>
        <p>Yet, these little fillets are among the original convenience foods. Just a few in a pasta sauce or a vinaigrette can add an intense shot of complex brininess, more like Parmesan than canned tuna.</p>
        <p>That easy flavor has a timeless appeal. Anchovies have been a vital ingredient since Roman days, and their fermented juice has been the base of condiments in many countries, from the fish sauce of Southeast Asia to Worcestershire sauce.</p>
        <p>Despite their reputation, anchovies are not overpowering, at least once cooked. Used with garlic as the start of a fast pasta sauce, they dissolve almost instantly and add a mysteriously meaty complexity that makes the sauce seem as if it had simmered for hours. Tossed with linguine and arugula, they make a simple dish sophisticated.</p>
        <p>Anchovies come in three forms: canned, salted and as a paste. The canned are most familiar. The first choice are those packed in olive oil, never soy or cottonseed oil. The ingredients list should read ''anchovies, olive oil, salt'' -- nothing more. The olive oil should be used with the anchovies in most dishes. The best canned anchovies come from Italy and are sold in Italian or specialty markets in large cans or jars. For $15 or so you should be able to buy half a kilo, about a pound.</p>
        <p>Once opened, they will keep refrigerated for a long time. Just top up the olive oil if it fails to cover the fish. If you open a tiny tin, store the leftovers in oil in a sealed plastic container or glass jar.</p>
        <p>Salted anchovies, sold in bulk in Italian markets from a large can or bucket, are the kind preferred by ''true'' Italians, at least so say cookbook writers. But they are a hassle: each fillet has to be rinsed and peeled off the tiny bones. And I don't think they are much better than the canned kind, which is probably why you don't see them used by many home cooks, including those in Italy.</p>
        <p>Anchovy paste is the most convenient form of the fish. You squeeze it out of a tube like toothpaste, with no grease or fishy smell on the fingers. But it costs more than twice as much by weight as canned anchovies, often with cream, butter, preservatives and other unnecessary ingredients.</p>
        <p>Anchovies can be used in almost as many ways as garlic. They are traditional in Jansson's Temptation, a Swedish dish, which is essentially creamy scalloped potatoes with layers of anchovies. Melted with butter, and with garlic, they form a powerful dipping sauce for raw vegetables.</p>
        <p>They can be stirred into a red-wine reduction to make a great sauce for grilled foods. Or with pine nuts and raisins, they can be sauteed with spinach, broccoli or other vegetables for a classic northern Mediterranean side dish. Minced or blended into a vinaigrette, they give any salad a Caesarlike quality, with no eggs or Parmesan.</p>
        <p>And there are even simpler uses for good anchovies. Layer them with roasted red or piquillo peppers and drizzle with olive oil. Or just lay them on good buttered bread.</p>
        <p>FAST TOMATO SAUCE WITH ANCHOVIES  Time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  1 teaspoon minced garlic  4 to 6 anchovy fillets, with some of their oil  1 28-ounce can tomatoes, crushed or chopped and drained of their juice  Salt and fresh-ground black pepper.</p>
        <p>1. Put the olive oil in a deep skillet, and turn the heat to medium. A minute later, add the garlic and the anchovies, and stir. When the garlic sizzles and the anchovies break up, add the tomatoes.</p>
        <p>2. Turn heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture becomes saucy, about 15 minutes. Season to taste, and serve with spaghetti or other long pasta. Grated pecorino Romano cheese goes well with this sauce.</p>
        <p>Yield: enough for 1 pound of pasta, about 4 servings.</p>
        <p>ANCHOVY VINAIGRETTE  Time: 5 minutes</p>
        <p>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil  3 tablespoons or more good red or white wine vinegar  Salt and fresh-ground black pepper to taste  1 heaping teaspoon Dijon mustard, optional  3 anchovy fillets, or more to taste, with some of their oil  1 large shallot (about 1 ounce), peeled and cut into chunks.</p>
        <p>1. Combine all ingredients except shallot in a blender, and turn the machine on. A creamy emulsion will form within 30 seconds. Taste, and add more vinegar if necessary, about a teaspoon at a time, until the balance tastes right.</p>
        <p>2. Add shallot, and turn machine on and off a few times, until shallot is minced within the dressing. Taste, adjust seasoning and serve. (This vinaigrette is best made fresh but will keep refrigerated for a few days. Before using, bring it back to room temperature, and whisk briefly.)</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>PASTA WITH ANCHOVIES AND ARUGULA  Time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>Salt and fresh-ground black pepper  4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  4 large cloves garlic, peeled and slivered  8 anchovy fillets, or more to taste, with some of their oil  1 pound linguine or other long pasta  2 cups arugula, washed, dried and chopped</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon or more crushed red pepper flakes.</p>
        <p>1. Set a large pot of water to a boil, and salt it.</p>
        <p>2. Put half of the olive oil in a deep skillet, and turn the heat to medium. A minute later, add the garlic and the anchovies. When the garlic sizzles and the anchovies break up, turn the heat to its lowest setting.</p>
        <p>3. Cook the pasta until it is tender but not mushy. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid, and drain. Add pasta and arugula to skillet, along with enough of the reserved cooking water to make a sauce. Turn heat to medium, and stir for a minute. Add salt and pepper to taste, plus a pinch or more of red pepper flakes.</p>
        <p>4. Turn pasta and sauce into a bowl, toss with remaining olive oil and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
