        <p>VALPOLICELLA, the light-bodied red wine made in northeastern Italy, is blessed with a name that easily rolls off the tongue. All too often, though, the wine fell flat, to the point where the word Valpolicella no longer signified a supple, inexpensive, easy-to-enjoy wine but became synonymous with thin, mass-produced wine of little character.</p>
        <p>You can still find those insipid Valpolicellas in wine shops, but in the last two decades, small winemakers in the region have taken great strides toward rehabilitating the Valpolicella name, producing fruity wines that range from lightly likable to elegant.</p>
        <p>Valpolicellas are blends, primarily of three grapes unfamiliar to Americans: rondinella, molinara and corvina. By law, wines made on a wide swath of land in the Veneto region, including terraced hillsides and large flat expanses, are permitted to be called Valpolicella, but the best wines generally come from the hillside vineyards in the oldest part of the Valpolicella zone and are labeled ''classico.'' Those wines called superiore are aged for at least a year and usually have a slightly higher alcohol level.</p>
        <p>Valpolicella's big appeal continues to be its light-bodied friendliness, which makes it a perfect summer red, served a tad chilled with anything from burgers to fish to pizza. Good examples of these fragrant wines can be found for $10 to $15 from producers like Masi and Allegrini.</p>
        <p>Even more exciting are Valpolicellas that have reached new levels of richness (and price) and  muscularity but are not overbearing. Giuseppe Quintarelli continues to turn out idiosyncratic wines that are aged at least six years before they are bottled. Mr. Quintarelli's son-in-law, Celentino Gaspari, seems to be poised to carry on the family tradition, having made the excellent Valpolicella Superiore 1996 for Marion.</p>
        <p>MARION, SUPERIORE, 1996 $39.50  Concentrated, with herbal, pine and berry aromas, sweet and fruity.</p>
        <p>. . .  GIUSEPPE QUINTARELLI, CLASSICO SUPERIORE, 1992 $35  Anise aromas, medium-bodied and mouthfilling.</p>
        <p>. . .  MASI, CLASSICO SUPERIORE, SEREGO ALIGHIERI, 1998 $12  Ripe aromas of berries and cherries, a rich mouthful of fruit.</p>
        <p>. . .  LUIGI RIGHETTI, CLASSICO SUPERIORE, CAMPOLIETI, 1997 $13.50  Unusual herbal, almost woodsy bouquet, cedar-licorice flavors.</p>
        <p>. . .  ALLEGRINI, CLASSICO SUPERIORE, PALAZZO DELLA TORRE, 1996 $17  Big and robust, complex flavors wrapped around a core of sweetness.</p>
        <p>. . .  SANTI, CLASSICO, SOLANE, 1998 $10  Light-bodied with whiffs of cherry and tar, easy to drink.</p>
        <p>Listed in order of preference. Prices are those paid in various Manhattan wine shops.</p>
