        <p>By all accounts -- including the account given by his music -- Otto Luening was a sweet soul who composed, played the flute and taught his students all through a very long life. Had he lived just four more years, he would have been at last Wednesday evening's centennial concert, given appropriately at Miller Theater on the campus at Columbia, the university he served with great distinction and affection for several decades.</p>
        <p>Luening is probably best remembered for his pioneering achievements in electronic music, and he was proud of those. He could take the trouble, in his 90's, to write to a critic to clarify what happened when he and his colleague, Vladimir Ussachevsky, presented the world's first concert of electronic music, at Columbia in 1952.</p>

        <p>By all accounts -- including the account given by his music -- Otto Luening was a sweet soul who composed, played the flute and taught his students all through a very long life. Had he lived just four more years, he would have been at last Wednesday evening's centennial concert, given appropriately at Miller Theater on the campus at Columbia, the university he served with great distinction and affection for several decades.</p>
        <p>Luening is probably best remembered for his pioneering achievements in electronic music, and he was proud of those. He could take the trouble, in his 90's, to write to a critic to clarify what happened when he and his colleague, Vladimir Ussachevsky, presented the world's first concert of electronic music, at Columbia in 1952.</p>
        <p>But there was more to him than the sounds and forms, still surprising and appealing, that he discovered during the early years of the tape recorder, and it was on his instrumental pieces and songs that the centennial celebration concentrated.</p>
        <p>The program showed that a lot in Luening's career can be explained with reference to his teacher, Busoni: the willingness to explore electronic music and, what might seem contradictory, the continuing attachment to older styles, including those especially of Bach and Mozart. Busoni-like, too, was Luening's unpretentious fecundity, and perhaps even his touches of Americana could be ascribed to Busoni, as well as to Copland.</p>
        <p>A typical Luening movement will start with some small musical point and fluently extend from it under the shadow of the masters, often with a dance rhythm gently in the background, though also, less conventionally, with a mysteriously wobbly sense of harmony. In a musical world where the old major and minor keys were losing their grip, Luening found ways to go on taking random walks, serene and sunlit, never minding that his chord progressions would have to slip in almost every measure.</p>
        <p>Some fine musicians were at Miller to go on these walks with their composer and their audience. Marc Peloquin honored both by playing a group of piano pieces from memory, with great poetry and accomplishment. Michael Finckel and Christopher Oldfather performed some pieces for cello and piano, including the weird ''Aria,'' which recalls virtually every operatic aria from Mozart to Puccini without quite quoting any.</p>
        <p>Judith Bettina, singing delightfully and also by heart, with James Goldsworthy at the piano, presented a sequence of songs showing little change in harmony or hymnlike style across all the years from 1917 to 1993. Margaret Lancaster, on the composer's own instrument, gave the first performances of ''Three Nocturnes'' with electronic echoes, notated by Dan Cooper from tapes made by Luening, and of Cooper's own Suite.</p>
