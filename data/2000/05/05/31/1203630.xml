        <p>This being a campaign season, novels with a political spin must be tolerated. It was ordained, for example, that Joe Klein would go to the Beltway again in hopes that a book under his own name would repeat at least some of the success of one by Anonymous. Ah, where is Bill Clinton when a writer needs him?</p>
        <p>One reviewer of the best-selling ''Primary Colors'' drew attention to the debt that the then-anonymous author owed to ''All the King's Men,'' Robert Penn Warren's 1946 novel based on the career of Huey Long, reminding readers of the central emotional relationship between Long and the narrator, Jack Burden. the governor's main aide. Although Mr. Klein delayed admitting his own role as writer, he frankly signaled his borrowing: In ''Primary Colors'' (Random House) President Jack Stanton's chief aide and the book's narrator is Henry Burton.</p>
        <p>The Klein novel was credited with perfect pitch in capturing the players and the spirit of the 1992 campaign. When Mr. Klein's identity was revealed, any reader could recognize the Washington journalist's know- how in the portraits of George Stephanopoulos, Mario Cuomo and Gennifer Flowers a k a Cashmere McLeod. That was the novel's strength. But set against its model, it also demonstrated the limitations of a good book by a good journalist compared with a smashing book by a very good novelist. For the reader, it was the difference between admiring a clever reproduction and being knocked out by the real thing.</p>
        <p>Seasonal sellers swiftly go, but the recent extortion conviction of the flamboyant Edwin W. Edwards, sometime governor of Louisiana, will have served a cultural purpose if it sends readers back to ''All the King's Men.'' In its marriage of political pertinence and literary distinction, Robert Penn Warren's novel endures where many other ''topical'' works speedily vanish.</p>
        <p>A half-century after its appearance, the combination of Warren's prose and the character of Willie Stark, his reimagining of Huey Long, retain their power. In Willie, Warren created not only a zesty campaigner but a figure who combined earnest populism with unscrupulous tactics, high-minded aspirations with tough-minded calculation, an irresistible appeal with appalling cynicism. He is a big figure, an American original.</p>
        <p>The first glimpse of Willie tells a lot about his just-folks manner and the book's flavor. Stopping off at a soda fountain on the way to visit his pappy, Willie spies ''a tall, gaunt-shanked, malarial, leather-faced slice of jerked venison, wearing jean pants and a brace of mustaches hanging off the kind of face you see in photographs of General Forrest's cavalrymen.''</p>
        <p>Their conversation goes like this:</p>
        <p>''How's your boy?'' Willie asked.</p>
        <p>''Aint doen so good.''</p>
        <p>''Sick?''</p>
        <p>''Naw, jail.''</p>
        <p>''My God, what they doing round here, putting good boys in jail?'</p>
        <p>''He's a good boy. Hit wuz a fahr faight, but he had a leetle bad luck.''</p>
        <p>''Huh?''</p>
        <p>''Hit wuz fahr and squahr, but he had a leetle bad luck. He stobbed the feller and he died.''</p>
        <p>''Tough tiddy. Tried yet?''</p>
        <p>''Not yit.''</p>
        <p>''Tough tiddy.''</p>
        <p>''I ain't complainen. Hit wuz fit fahr and squahr.''</p>
        <p>''Glad to seen you. Tell your boy to keep his tail over the dashboard.''</p>
        <p>Later, Willie directs Jack Burden to get onto the case and scout out a smart lawyer to help the countryman's son or to put in a quiet fix. When it comes to a face-off between the law and a good old boy, Willie is with the fellow with a leetle bad luck.</p>
        <p>And when, in an important turn, Willie runs up against a judge with a reputation for honesty who decides not to endorse Willie's candidate, the order is to dig up dirt on the judge: ''It's dirt makes the grass grow.''</p>
        <p>Suppose there isn't anything worth the digging? Jack asks. Willie, with his Old Testament view of his fellow man, sets him straight: ''Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption and he passeth from the stink of the didie to the stench of the shroud. There is always something.'' (Mr. Klein has one of his characters make the same point in almost the same words: ''There's always something there.'')</p>
        <p>Something is found; no one doubts that, if pressed, Willie will use it even if it means the good judge's ruin. Willie is not fond of the law; it keeps getting in the way of his plans to better the lives of all the down-and-outers who know that he is on their side against those who these days are known as special interests.</p>
        <p>In a speech, Willie draws Depression-era cheers with promises that, given a little spiffing, resemble those that today's candidates still find useful although they may lack Willie's incantatory locutions: ''And it is your right that every child shall have a complete education. That no person aged and infirm shall want or beg for bread. That the man who produces something shall be able to carry it to market without miring to the hub, without toll. That no poor man's house or land shall be taxed. That the rich men and the great companies that draw wealth from this state shall pay this state a fair share. That you shall not be deprived of hope!''</p>
        <p>Willie means it on the stump, and his audiences believe him. He is a radical in a jurisdiction where the wealthy and the powerful are accustomed to reign. He has a tendency toward the dictatorial but he steers clear of flat-out extortion. Yet he does not allow squeamishness to get in the way of what he believes needs to be done; forget the pieties of those who never get their hands dirty or do anything worth doing.</p>
        <p>As for the law, neither Governor Edwards nor Governor Long were sticklers. Willie shares their unenthusiastic outlook. He calls the law ''a single-bed blanket on a double bed and three folks in the bed and a cold night.'' And he goes on: ''There ain't ever enough blanket to cover the case, no matter how much pulling and hauling, and somebody is always going to nigh catch pneumonia. Hell, the law is like the pants you bought last year for a growing boy, but it is always this year and the seams are popped and the shankbones to the breeze. The law is always too short and too tight for growing humankind.''</p>
        <p>What Willie understands is that society is bent on doing business, and if that means winking at the law, that's the way things are and were and always will be: ''It's just a question of who has got his front feet in the trough when slopping time comes.'' The observation doesn't seem to have lost much in the last 50 or 100 years or a lot longer.</p>
        <p>When reformers cry ''Graft!'' Willie grants that O.K., there may be a little, just enough to make the wheels turn without squeaking. He would probably have faulted Mr. Edwards for squeaking so noisily that he compelled the righteous to crack down.</p>
        <p>It is unfair to ask that Mr. Klein's portrait of Bill Clinton in ''Primary Colors'' should approach Warren's vividly reimagined portrait of Huey Long. Whatever one's opinion of the President, he was no Huey Long.</p>
        <p>As for the Klein book's popularity, along with being an engaging read it seems to have benefited both from the hoopla about the anonymity of the author and from readers' belief that they were getting the down and dirty goods from the season's Deep Throat.</p>
        <p>Lacking that appeal, Mr. Klein's second try at a political novel, ''The Running Mate''(Dial Press), has stirred little interest, and the Clinton-Stephanopoulous doings are yesterday's news. As for Willie, he endures. His language may be a touch dated, more's the pity, but the character is as vibrant as ever. Warren wrote a book for all seasons.</p>
