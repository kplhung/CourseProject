        <p>In the 10 weeks since Boomer Esiason was fired from ''Monday Night Football,'' ABC has offered no information about replacement(s).</p>
        <p>Don Ohlmeyer, the producer, has cheerfully refused to stoke speculation. When last seen, Howard Katz, the president of ABC Sports, was waving the starter's flag at the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday, leading to speculation that he was interviewing Bobby Knight for Esiason's job.</p>
        <p>Current rumors have Rush Limbaugh out, Sterling Sharpe of ESPN in and Dan Fouts, an ABC college football analyst, being considered. Ohlmeyer said: ''We've talked to a lot of people and auditioned a good number of people.'' Is the Star Search over? ''Maybe not,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Who besides the play-by-play announcer Al Michaels is in? Well, Hank Williams Jr., who sings ''Monday Night's'' theme song.</p>
        <p>''Probably,'' Ohlmeyer said.</p>
        <p>ABC's post-Esiason search has been vexed by the absence of available superstar analysts, and the inability to find escape clauses in the contracts of big names like Fox's Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Cris Collinsworth, whom Fox made action figures of last year.</p>
        <p>''They contacted my representatives, but I'm under contract,'' Long said. He said he would have difficulty leaving Fox ''even if there were an out in my contract'' because of loyalty to the sports division's top executives, David Hill and Ed Goren. ''I know where the rudder is in my shop,'' he said. '' 'Monday Night' is a tremendous stage, but I don't know where it's going.''</p>
        <p>Ohlmeyer is on target for a mid-June announcement of his analyst(s). ''I'm doing hard-core planning,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''There's a ton of different pieces to pull together.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''We're focused on details like the logo, where to shoot our openings and the number of cameras.''</p>
        <p>Lord Stanley's Finals on ABC</p>
        <p>In Year 1 of its National Hockey League contract, ABC has a chance to carry up to five games in prime time, starting with Game 3 Saturday. During its five-year tenure with the N.H.L., Fox reached its maximum of three once, last year.</p>
        <p>But the Devils-Dallas series offers a problem for ABC: a possible fifth game on June 8, a Thursday, would pre-empt ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''</p>
        <p>On Thursdays during the recently concluded prime-time season, ''Millionaire'' averaged a 17.5 Nielsen rating, while the finals never achieved more than a 4.0 rating on Fox. Last season, Fox averaged a 3.4 for the finals.</p>
        <p>ABC's lowest-rated show this season, ''Wasteland,'' averaged a 3.8.</p>
        <p>Larry Hyams, ABC's vice president of audience analysis, smoothed over the coming precipitous fall of its June 8 rating.</p>
        <p>''Even though ABC's prime-time number would be lower with hockey, we are exposing the Stanley Cup finals to a much larger and broad-based audience than those who would watch it on Saturday or Sunday afternoons,'' Hyams said.</p>
        <p>Still, that benefit accrues more to the ratings-starved N.H.L. than to ABC. ''If hockey does well, it helps ABC,'' Hyams added.</p>
        <p>ABC's postseason 1.5 rating is the same Fox had through the same stage of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Extension Period to Expire</p>
        <p>The exclusive period for NBC and Fox to extend their deals with Major League Baseball expires on June 5. But baseball is unlikely to get the maximum until it opens bidding to all comers when the period ends.</p>
        <p>Baseball clearly wants a major jump above the combined $950 million Fox and NBC will have paid since 1996 when their contracts expire after the World Series.</p>
        <p>ESPN's new six-year deal -- three very expensive years added to the last three years of the previous contract -- pays baseball an average of $135.8 million annually, nearly four times more than the 1999 fee.</p>
        <p>''Show me a negotiation where anybody pays less, and we'll have a headline,'' said Ed Goren, the president of Fox Sports. In his view, ESPN is paying so much because its previous deal was undervalued.</p>
        <p>''I don't see the NBC and Fox packages as being undervalued,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Knight Gets Off Easy</p>
        <p>ESPN's hourlong interview with Bob Knight last night was riveting as the embattled Indiana basketball coach challenged nearly every question about his anger put to him by Roy Firestone and Digger Phelps. But by not showing Knight the tape of him choking former player, Neil Reed, during a practice in 1997, ESPN failed viewers.</p>
        <p>ESPN said it planned to show Knight the tape, but five minutes before air time an Indiana official called to say that the university believed the tape would not be aired. ''That wasn't our understanding,'' said Josh Krulewitz, an ESPN spokesman. Why did ESPN give in? It is reasoned, rather lamely, that it had used the tape to introduce the show. Knight couldn't see it, rendering it useless. What if ESPN had defied Indiana?</p>
        <p>''He could have walked out,'' Krulewitz said. Not showing the tape lessened the program and Firestone's ability to challenge Knight when he said he hadn't watched the tape ''because I didn't have to look at it to know that I didn't choke anyone.''</p>
        <p>But Firestone was in a bind. He inexcusably admitted that he hadn't seen the tape -- just freeze frames -- so he couldn't dispute Knight's insistence that Reed's allegation was not fully upheld by the tape.</p>
