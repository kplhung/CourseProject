        <p>OPEN-AIR markets where farmers sell freshly dug potatoes, fragrant herbs and dewy berries enrich the fabric of many cities. Paris has 62 outdoor markets, which have long been anchors of their neighborhoods. In New York, the 28 Greenmarkets, a network begun in 1976, have changed the city's food scene.</p>
        <p>Now, two new lavishly photographed books celebrate these cornucopias: ''Paris in a Basket: Markets -- The Food and the People'' by Nicolle Aimee Meyer and Amanda Pilar Smith (Konemann, $19.95) and ''The Greenmarket Cookbook: Recipes, Tips and Lore From the World Famous Urban Farmer's Market'' by Joel Patraker (the markets' assistant director) and Joan Schwartz (Viking, $29.95).</p>
        <p>The French book is the more focused and rewarding. The authors spent a year walking in Paris, and their book tours the markets by arrondissement. It puts personalities behind the farmers, fishermen, butchers, cheese mongers, bakers and other food producers who set up shop in stalls. They are people like Daniel and Monique Letard, who sell poultry and game in the Joinville market and who recommend putting some farmer cheese in the cavity of a pheasant before roasting to keep it from drying out.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Greenmarkets in New York, not all the vendors in Paris produce their own wares. Some gather cheeses, for example, from sources in Normandy, or seafood from fishermen in Brittany. The markets operate year round and offer foods that can include, depending on the neighborhood, Chinese teas, Spanish oranges and Indian spices. They represent a tradition that predates grocery stores and supermarkets, and they often serve as colorful substitutes for the more antiseptic stores.</p>
        <p>''Paris in a Basket'' sketches the surroundings of each market, including food shops, a few restaurants and historic sights, making it worthwhile for the food-loving tourist. Throughout the book appear brief excursions on subjects like oysters, olives, organic farming and butchers. Unfortunately, there is no index, so finding any of these nuggets easily is impossible.</p>
        <p>Each section of the book includes a few fairly classic recipes, like moules marinieres, vinaigrette salads, onion soup, potato gratin, apple cake and duck breast with port, most of which can be found in many other books. I loved the silky, cumin-scented avocado vichyssoise, a more unusual recipe. But even it needed a spritz of lemon juice to bring up the flavor, and I found it impossible to cram all the ingredients into my blender at once. As good as the recipes may be, they are basically beside the point.</p>
        <p>The Greenmarket book, by contrast, is filled with recipes. But it is more valuable for listing produce and other foods by season, along with helpful charts describing the varieties of apples, squashes, potatoes, peppers, tomatoes, herbs and other foods.</p>
        <p>The book tells how Barry Benepe, a Hudson Valley urban planner, conceived of the Greenmarkets as a way for growers in the region to sell their produce in the city and keep their farms alive. It profiles farmers, fishermen and cheesemakers who sell their wares today. Unfortunately, it is not clear where a shopper can find those sellers among the markets. The book also lacks a guide to market sites and schedules, but that may be because they often change.</p>
        <p>The recipes come from chefs, farmers, food writers and Greenmarket shoppers. Some are quick to make, like baked Jerusalem artichoke chips, green beans with savory and bacon, and tomato salad with chilies and feta. Others, like duck salad with fresh peas and radishes, are complex.</p>
        <p>Many recipes I tried needed fine-tuning, and a fellow reporter had the same problem. That duck salad recipe does not say how long it takes to roast the legs, and there was too much oil in a beet, pear and Gorgonzola salad. A roasted strawberry clafoutis was heavy and dense, no match for the custardy cherry clafoutis in the French book.</p>
        <p>As in the French book, all the ingredients for a cool soup, this time made with cucumbers, did not fit into my blender. But unlike the recipes in the French book, which is more a Baedeker, the Greenmarket recipes are the main feature. That's the problem.</p>
        <p>AVOCADO VICHYSSOISE  Adapted from ''Paris in a Basket''  Time: 30 minutes, plus chilling</p>
        <p>1 1/4 pounds medium boiling potatoes, peeled and quartered  Salt  2 Hass avocados, peeled, pitted and coarsely chopped  4 cups chilled, defatted chicken stock</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon ground cumin  Juice of 1 lemon  Freshly ground black pepper to taste  Cilantro leaves for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. Place potatoes in a saucepan of salted water, and cook until tender. Drain.</p>
        <p>2. Place half the potatoes and half the avocados in a blender with 1 cup chicken stock, cumin and lemon juice. Process to smooth puree, gradually adding another cup of stock, and transfer to a bowl. Puree the remaining potatoes and avocados with the remaining stock, and combine with the first batch. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Refrigerate.</p>
        <p>3. Serve garnished with a few cilantro leaves.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>ALAN HARDING'S CHILLED CUCUMBER SOUP  Adapted from ''The Greenmarket Cookbook''  Time: 20 minutes</p>
        <p>8 medium cucumbers, peeled</p>
        <p>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice  2 teaspoons salt, or to taste</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon fresh-ground pepper  2 tablespoons white wine vinegar  1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder  Pinch ground cardamom  Pinch cayenne  1 cup plain yogurt.</p>
        <p>1. Chop all but one of the cucumbers. Place half of chopped cucumbers in blender with lemon juice, salt, pepper, vinegar, curry powder, cardamom and cayenne. Puree. Transfer to bowl. Puree remaining chopped cucumbers, and mix with first batch. Stir in yogurt. Chill until ready to serve.</p>
        <p>2. Quarter the remaining cucumber lengthwise, remove seeds and slice thin. Adjust seasoning of soup if necessary, and serve garnished with cucumber slices.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 to 6 servings.</p>
