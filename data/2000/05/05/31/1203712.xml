        <p>Wherever he went, from the Kostas family restaurant with its $4.99 steak-and-egg special to the Statler Golden Ballroom, with its $25-a-plate fund-raiser special of grilled chicken, potatoes and carrots, Rick A. Lazio tried to ignore his swollen lip and mold his message.</p>
        <p>His injured upper right lip, the result of a spill while marching in a Memorial Day parade, and his developing platform were on the minds of those who sat with him at Kostas, toasted him with ovations at the Statler during a luncheon sponsored by Republican women or caught a glimpse of him as he traveled about the convention at the Hyatt Regency here and to nearby restaurants, shaking hands and hugging, while refraining from kissing.</p>

        <p>Wherever he went, from the Kostas family restaurant with its $4.99 steak-and-egg special to the Statler Golden Ballroom, with its $25-a-plate fund-raiser special of grilled chicken, potatoes and carrots, Rick A. Lazio tried to ignore his swollen lip and mold his message.</p>
        <p>His injured upper right lip, the result of a spill while marching in a Memorial Day parade, and his developing platform were on the minds of those who sat with him at Kostas, toasted him with ovations at the Statler during a luncheon sponsored by Republican women or caught a glimpse of him as he traveled about the convention at the Hyatt Regency here and to nearby restaurants, shaking hands and hugging, while refraining from kissing.</p>
        <p>In the hours before and after his acceptance speech, Mr. Lazio made no bold pronouncements. Instead, he repeated his stock declarations that ''I know I need to earn this'' and that his positions fall in the ''mainstream'' of New Yorkers. But he tried to adapt to the interests of upstate residents and even tried the personal touch, with mixed results.</p>
        <p>At Kostas, he sat down with people like Lou Selva, who owns a carpet store and worries about the flight of businesses and young people from the region. Mr. Lazio suggested Mr. Selva speak at a school as a role model, advice Mr. Selva at first seemed to accept but later told reporters he had trouble swallowing.</p>
        <p>''Why would he want me to speak at a school? What can I tell the kids?'' said Mr. Selva, a Democrat. He still said Mr. Lazio impressed him and probably earned his vote for the simple fact that he did not see Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic nominee, as a New Yorker.</p>
        <p>Several of the 11 residents who met with Mr. Lazio at the restaurant complained about ''brain drain'' from upstate to downstate and other parts of the country. Two hours later, Mr. Lazio stood on a foot-high platform at the center of the ballroom and told the crowd of 700 people: ''We don't want to export any of our children from New York State. We want them here.''</p>
        <p>The day had its light moments. His aides cringed both at the morning newspapers' photos of Mr. Lazio on hands and knees after his fall and reporters' and conventioneers' puns about a ''stumbling campaign.'' Mr. Lazio took his injury in stride publicly, refining jokes he tried out in appearances after the incident. Soaking in applause at the luncheon, Mr. Lazio said, ''If you keep giving me a response like that it's going to pop out my stitches.''</p>
        <p>Some, however, worried privately that the mishap reflected a boyish, overeager 42-year-old campaigner, a marked contrast to the problem many bemoaned months ago, that the then-presumptive nominee, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, did not have his heart in the race.</p>
        <p>Many people voiced concern about the mayor's health, but an upbeat mood prevailed at the convention, now that Republicans had finally settled on a nominee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani was not here -- he has said he does not want to steal some of Mr. Lazio's limelight -- but he remained on the minds of many, who often praised the mayor for civic improvements but lamented his reputation for divisiveness.</p>
        <p>Fred Brown, president of the New York State Black Republicans Council, acknowledged Mr. Giuliani's trouble attracting support among black and Hispanic New Yorkers after a series of police shootings and brutality cases involving young black men. That is not the case, he said, with Mr. Lazio, who Mr. Brown said was eager to attend meetings with black Republicans and has already campaigned in predominantly Hispanic East Harlem.</p>
        <p>''I think Rick Lazio is going to be Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare,'' Mr. Brown said, predicting Mr. Lazio would ''destroy the myth'' that blacks and Hispanics would automatically favor Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Those who are energized by Mr. Lazio's candidacy find themselves sorting through his positions and raising questions.</p>
        <p>''He's not as abrasive and seems more flexible than Mayor Giuliani,'' said Glory Ann Cranston, a Buffalo legal secretary who attended the luncheon for Mr. Lazio but doubted that she would vote for him. ''He's energetic, he's great, but he's pro-choice.'' She said she would wait to see if an anti-abortion candidate from another party emerged before deciding what to do. Mr. Lazio favors abortion rights, but is opposed to public financing of abortions and favors a ban on late-term abortions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has charmed many here with his generally moderate positions, even those from traditionally conservative areas. ''He's more conservative than Hillary,'' Anthony G. Scannapieco Jr., the Putnam County Republican chairman, said after listening to Mr. Lazio outline his positions in his acceptance speech this afternoon.</p>
        <p>In the evening, shortly after his speech, Mr. Lazio beamed as fireworks erupted around his campaign bus, the Mainstream Express, which he unveiled at a ballpark downtown.</p>
        <p>''You people have enthusiasm that's contagious and it's going to spread throughout this state,'' he told a cheering audience at the stadium. ''This is going to be a grass-roots campaign that touches every New Yorker. We're going to be in every county, in every community, in every neighborhood, on every street. We're going to go door to door if we have to.''</p>
