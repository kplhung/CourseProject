        <p>Kurt Abbott did not think he would get much playing time when he signed with the Mets. He considered the positions he usually plays, and noticed Gold Glove winners at third base and shortstop and a superstar at second base. ''Where's the room?'' Abbott said just a few days ago.</p>
        <p>He was not complaining. In fact, although he has started only 12 of the Mets' first 50 games, Abbott said he was playing more than he expected. He will play a lot more now, after the injury to starting shortstop Rey Ordonez on Monday.</p>
        <p>Ordonez sustained a nondisplaced fracture of his left ulna bone when the helmet of the Dodgers' F. P. Santangelo collided with his forearm as he applied the tag on a pickoff play. Ordonez is not expected to begin baseball drills for at least six weeks, meaning he is probably out until the All-Star Game break. General Manager Steve Phillips said Monday his first choice is to fill the position from within.</p>
        <p>Today, the Mets contacted the agent for Kevin Stocker, who was released last week by Tampa Bay. But Stocker instead signed with the Anaheim Angels tonight. Baltimore's Mike Bordick, who is having a fine season on a sub-.500 team and can be a free agent at the end of the year, could also be available.</p>
        <p>The Mets may choose to put their bench to use. Even though Melvin Mora and Joe McEwing can play shortstop, Manager Bobby Valentine said today that Abbott would be used  most often.</p>
        <p>''He's always been more of an offensive player than a defensive player,'' Phillips said. ''But he's played fine defense for us this year. We need to get his bat going a little bit. This might be the time to try to get Abby going, get him started.</p>
        <p>''A lot of times when a guy's coming off the bench, it's that feeling of having to get a hit or you're not in there tomorrow,'' Phillips said. ''Now, he's in there tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Abbott, who went 1 for 4 after Ordonez was injured, had 5 hits in his last 40 at-bats before tonight's game at Dodger Stadium. Abbott played regularly for Florida in 1994 and '95 and semiregularly the next two years. Last year he had 286 at-bats for Colorado.</p>
        <p>''His mind-set is a very aggressive personality,'' said Al Leiter, who played with Abbott on the Marlins. ''It's very difficult for a guy like that to sit out three or four days and not play and then expect a guy like that, who's a little bit on the hyper side anyway, to be a good pinch-hitter.''</p>
        <p>Watching a video of himself over the weekend, Abbott noticed a timing flaw in his swing and said he thinks he is swinging better.</p>
        <p>''I can't remember the last time I hit the ball hard two times in a game,'' Abbott said after Monday's 4-1 loss to the Dodgers. ''I hit home runs, I hit doubles, but I haven't shown that yet. Hopefully at some point it's going to click, and today was a good little confidence boost offensively.''</p>
        <p>Abbott has decent power, but has only three extra-base hits so far, all doubles, and is still searching for his first run batted in. Last year, he had 41 R.B.I. in 286 at-bats.</p>
        <p>Even if Abbott does not improve -- he is batting .200 now -- he cannot do much worse than Ordonez, who was batting .188.</p>
        <p>The biggest question for the Mets will be replacing Ordonez on defense. He is a three-time Gold Glove winner with a career fielding percentage of .977, and Abbott considers him the best shortstop in baseball.</p>
        <p>Abbott has a career .960 fielding percentage at shortstop, and although he has made no errors there in 13 games this year, he has averaged only 15 games per year at short the last three seasons. Abbott said there is no way he can approach Ordonez's skills.</p>
        <p>''I'm not replacing him,'' Abbott said. ''I'm filling in for him. I'm not going to fool any people because I can't do what Rey Ordonez does.''</p>
        <p>Abbott does have a strong arm, which he showed on Monday when his relay throw on a double by Chad Kreuter cut down Eric Karros at the plate, preserving a scoreless tie in the fifth inning. Abbott's throw was so strong that Mike Piazza had to leap high to catch it before landing and blocking Karros's way to the plate.</p>
        <p>''Kurt made the perfect throw, and Kurt getting it in there was the key to the play,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Wednesday's game, the final one in this three-city, nine-game road trip, features a matchup of aces: MIKE HAMPTON and KEVIN BROWN. Brown, who is 4-1 with a 2.57 earned run average, allowed three runs to the Mets in five innings on April 8 before he injured himself bunting. Hampton is 4-0 with an 0.86 E.R.A. over his last four starts, issuing just four walks in 31 1/3 innings. . . . The first National League All-Star balloting results were announced Tuesday, and catcher MIKE PIAZZA leads all National League players. . . . Center fielder DARRYL HAMILTON took batting practice and ''power-walked'' Tuesday for the first time since his toe surgery on May 9. He still hopes to start playing around the break for the All-Star Game. . . . Starter RICK REED still has soreness in his left side but BOBBY VALENTINE said it now seems less likely that Reed will go on the disabled list.</p>
