        <p>In the clearest indication yet that the Pirro family mixed business with politics, a witness testified today that a prominent Republican consultant who worked on Jeanine F. Pirro's 1993 campaign for Westchester district attorney was paid by one of her husband's businesses.</p>
        <p>The testimony came during the seventh day of the tax-fraud trial of Mrs. Pirro's husband, Albert J. Pirro Jr., the area's most influential Republican lobbyist and real estate lawyer. He is accused, together with his accountant and brother, Anthony G. Pirro, of improperly deducting more than $1.2 million in personal expenses as business expenditures between 1988 and 1997.</p>

        <p>In the clearest indication yet that the Pirro family mixed business with politics, a witness testified today that a prominent Republican consultant who worked on Jeanine F. Pirro's 1993 campaign for Westchester district attorney was paid by one of her husband's businesses.</p>
        <p>The testimony came during the seventh day of the tax-fraud trial of Mrs. Pirro's husband, Albert J. Pirro Jr., the area's most influential Republican lobbyist and real estate lawyer. He is accused, together with his accountant and brother, Anthony G. Pirro, of improperly deducting more than $1.2 million in personal expenses as business expenditures between 1988 and 1997.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Pirro has not been charged with wrongdoing. But as witnesses have testified about her involvement in the family's finances, from personal furnishings to utility bills to her political campaigns and aspirations, her image has not emerged unscathed.</p>
        <p>Last week, for instance, a parade of painters, woodworkers, rug salesman, car salesmen and others who have intersected with the Pirro checkbook offered intimate details of the family's high-ticket spending habits, invoice after invoice, check after check: a $2,000 clock here, a $13,250 Chinese rug there.</p>
        <p>Then, a former secretary of Mrs. Pirro's said that during her tenure as a Westchester County judge she regularly routed household bills to her husband's office so that some of those bills would be paid with corporate checks.</p>
        <p>But today, the testimony shifted away from the Pirros' zest for good living and toward Mrs. Pirro's quest for political office, as the brother of the campaign strategist Arthur J. Finkelstein, one of New York's biggest names in Republican politics, answered numerous questions from federal prosecutors about how Albert Pirro was, to say the least, an extremely supportive and generous political spouse.</p>
        <p>The brother, Ronald W. Finkelstein, explained that in early 1993, Mr. Pirro's law firm wrote three checks for services related to Mrs. Pirro's run for district attorney.</p>
        <p>One, for $8,800, went to his brother's political consulting firm, Arthur J. Finkelstein &amp; Associates. A second, for $12,269.15, went to the two brothers' polling company, Diversified Research, where Ronald Finkelstein was an office manager. The third, for $3.795.84, was made out to Mahoney &amp; Associates, a political consulting firm run by Kieran Mahoney, who has worked on campaigns for Gov. George E. Pataki and former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.</p>
        <p>All three checks were returned, though, to Mr. Pirro's law firm. But eventually, in a series of ''check swaps,'' the first two bills were paid by Albert Pirro's personal account and Mrs. Pirro's campaign. The third, for $3,795.84, was paid by Planning Associates of Ohio -- which one of Mr. Pirro's secretaries later testified was one of 33 companies run by Mr. Pirro.</p>
        <p>''Check we received on 6/21 was from Pirro &amp; Monsell and should have been from Pirro campaign,'' said one handwritten note in a check register. ''This is a check swap.''</p>
        <p>The payments do not appear to violate campaign spending rules; although corporations are, in general, limited to donating $5,000 a year, spouses have more flexibility. But at the very least, the payments give the appearance of pushing such limits to creative extremes.</p>
        <p>Federal prosecutors also did not explicitly state today that these political consulting fees were improperly deducted. Then again, they have not yet stated that for any of the expenses that they have introduced as evidence thus far. They are expected to do so next week when they call as their leading witness an agent with the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Pirro, who has attended all but one day of the trial, slipped into the courtroom this morning after Mr. Finkelstein was excused as a  witness. But when asked about details of her campaign finances, Mrs. Pirro said she would not comment because ''it would be inappropriate.''</p>
