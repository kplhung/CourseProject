        <p>The Coca-Cola Company and the Creative Artists Agency will work together again in a strategic consulting agreement that calls for Creative Artists to help Coca-Cola with entertainment marketing for its soft-drink brands worldwide. Terms of the deal, which was announced yesterday, were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>The goal of the agreement is for Creative Artists, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., to assist Coca-Cola in identifying celebrities, trends, music, movies, television shows and entertainment events that will resonate with consumers and can be connected to Coca-Cola products.</p>
        <p>''Entertainment uniquely reaches into the hearts and minds of consumers,'' said Steve Jones, chief marketing officer at Coca-Cola, who praised what he called ''C.A.A.'s entertainment radar.''</p>
        <p>Creative Artists, a leading Hollywood talent agency, formed a unit in 1991 that worked on advertising for the Coca-Cola flagship brand until 1995. The successor to that unit, Edge Creative in Santa Monica, Calif., had been independent from Creative Artists from 1995 and worked on Coca-Cola Classic campaigns until closing on May 1.</p>
        <p>Creative Artists has an affiliation with a New York advertising agency, Shepardson, Stern &amp; Kaminsky. While the agreement is ''not an advertising initiative,'' said Scott Jacobson, a Coca-Cola spokesman, ''if something was to come up and it made sense to do some advertising, there's nothing to say C.A.A. wouldn't be involved in that.''</p>
