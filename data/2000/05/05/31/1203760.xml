        <p>THEY are known as butterflies for their style, but their wings are their padded legs. Instead of fluttering, these masked butterflies spread those wings, crouch, sprawl, dive. Anything to stop the puck.</p>
        <p>They are the two goaltenders in the Stanley Cup final: Martin Brodeur for the Devils, Ed Belfour for the defending champion Stars. And for all the speculation about the scorers, the defensemen, the power plays and the penalty-killers, the hotter goaltender surely will determine the eventual championship team.</p>
        <p>In last night's opener, Brodeur was the hot goaltender when he had to be as the Devils rolled, 7-3. Belfour was not even lukewarm before he was benched early in the third period after surrendering six goals. You would have thought the Devils' pucks were made in Costa Rica.</p>
        <p>With two spectacular saves a split-second apart on Mike Modano and Brett Hull midway in the second period, Brodeur turned the game. Had either of those two snipers scored, the Stars would have pulled into a 2-2 tie. Instead, moments after those two spectacular saves, Petr Sykora lifted the Devils to a 3-1 lead.</p>
        <p>In the earlier playoff rounds, Modano and Hull each had scored nine goals -- Modano the handsome center who shoots from anywhere, Hull the son of the Golden Jet, Bobby Hull. And suddenly Modano was swooping across the blue line with the puck to Brodeur's right while Hull roared down the middle toward the Devils' net.</p>
        <p>''Modano came down flying, the puck bouncing a little bit,'' said Brodeur, who needed only 13 other saves. ''He hit a big slapper that I had a hard time holding. I didn't know who got the rebound at the time, but it was Hull. He probably shot it into my glove more than I made the save. I got lucky there.''</p>
        <p>The hot goaltender is always a little lucky; that's what makes him hot. But going into the playoff final, the two goaltenders' stats for the three previous rounds had virtually identical heat:</p>
        <p>Brodeur had a 1.77 goals-against average; Belfour's was 1.81. Brodeur had allowed 30 goals, Belfour 31. Brodeur had a .923 save percentage; Belfour's was .931. Brodeur had two shutouts; Belfour had three. Each had a 12-5 won-lost record.</p>
        <p>Equally important, each's name has been engraved on the Stanley Cup once -- Brodeur's in 1995, Belfour's a year ago.</p>
        <p>In hockey, a goaltender is always a team's most important player because he is its constant on the ice. The forwards and the defenseman change every minute or so, but the goaltender is always out there in front of his 6-by-4-foot net.</p>
        <p>It's as if a baseball team could use its ace pitcher in every game. Imagine a World Series with Pedro Martinez pitching every game for the Red Sox or Randy Johnson pitching every game for the Diamondbacks.</p>
        <p>''When you're young,'' Brodeur said, alluding to the 1995 playoffs when the Devils swept the Red Wings in the final, ''you don't pay attention to details, you just go with it. Everything falls into place and you play the game. When you're older, you have more responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Brodeur is 28 now, one of the bigger goaltenders at 6 feet 2 inches and 205 pounds.</p>
        <p>''He knows the league better than he did in 1995,'' said Jacques Caron, the Devils' goaltender coach. ''He knows who to look for. For this series he knows that Hull has a quick release, that Modano shoots from anywhere.''</p>
        <p>Brodeur was shaky occasionally earlier in these playoffs. Belfour was more consistent</p>
        <p>''Belfour's in a zone now,'' Caron said before last night's opener. ''He was the difference in the Stars beating Colorado in the Western Conference final. He has great determination. He's like Tony Esposito was with the Black Hawks years ago, a reflex goaltender, but he's more mobile than Tony was. Martin is more of an angle goaltender.''</p>
        <p>But last night Belfour, stung for six goals in only 18 shots, was no longer in that zone. Colder than the Meadowlands ice, he blamed a cold.</p>
        <p>''I took antibiotics and a decongestant for it,'' he said. ''The decongestant probably affected me more than anything. I didn't feel like I had a lot of energy. I was making bad decisions.''</p>
        <p>But when did he realize the decongestant was a problem?</p>
        <p>''After six goals,'' said the cold goaltender who had a cold.</p>
