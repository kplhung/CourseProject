        <p>Perry Dane letter, commenting on Glenn C Loury's May 29 Op-Ed article on righting the wrongs of slavery, says unjust enrichment laws might serve as model for reparations</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Glenn C. Loury (Op-Ed, May 29) may be right to be skeptical about the drive to give ''reparations'' to African-Americans, if ''reparation'' is understood as ''compensation for past racial injury.'' Any effort to calculate such damages might raise intractable conceptual difficulties. But there is another model for reparations. That model does not look to the analogy of tort law, which compensates victims for their suffering, but to unjust enrichment law, which forces the recipients of ill-gotten gains to give up their profits.</p>

        <p>The essence of slavery is the extraction of labor without monetary compensation. Payment for the profits of slavery does not raise the same difficulties as payment for injury. More important, this model treats African-Americans not as mere victims but as contributors to the commonweal who deserve the reward of their labors.</p>
