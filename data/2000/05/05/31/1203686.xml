        <p>The Nasdaq composite index surged to its biggest percentage gain and the second-largest point gain in its 29-year history yesterday as investors snapped up technology heavyweights like Intel, Cisco Systems and Oracle.</p>
        <p>The index shot up 254.37 points, or 7.9 percent, to 3,459.48. Of the stocks that make up the Nasdaq 100 index, 98 rose in price and 2 lost ground.</p>
        <p>Even with the gains, the Nasdaq is still down nearly 15 percent so far this year.</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index jumped 44.43 points, or 3.2 percent, yesterday, to 1,422.45, and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 227.89 points, or 2.2 percent, to 10,527.13.</p>
        <p>The performance of the Nasdaq was the highlight of a very strong session for stocks generally.</p>
        <p>''This could be the start of something good,'' said Bill Allyn, head of listed trading at Jefferies &amp; Company. Mr. Allyn and others said it was significant that stocks, which opened strong, remained that way throughout the session.</p>
        <p>''Investors expected the market to rally and fail, as they have so many times during this correction,'' he said. ''When the market didn't pull back, it came as a surprise.''</p>
        <p>Despite the positives and the possibility of an impending summer rally, there are some caveats. This was the first day after a long weekend, and trading volume, a good gauge of investor enthusiasm, was fairly light. About 844.2 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>And the gains were recorded without a great deal of market-moving news developments. Later this week investors will be confronted with a number of important economic reports, including the May employment data, which is scheduled to be released on Friday.</p>
        <p>But for a day, optimism reigned.</p>
        <p>''The Nasdaq is the index people will be watching going forward, because it is seen as still being vulnerable,'' said Bill Schneider, head of block equity trading at Warburg Dillon Read.</p>
        <p>The gains came on a day when Laszlo Birinyi, one of Wall Street's most bullish stock market forecasters who runs his own market research firm in Westport, Conn., turned a bit cautious.</p>
        <p>Mr. Birinyi, whose forecasts over the last few years have been closer to the market's actual performance than those of most of his colleagues, started the year predicting that the S.&amp; P. 500 would rise another 20 percent.</p>
        <p>''A lot of things have changed,'' since then,'' he said yesterday. As a consequence, Mr. Birinyi says the S.&amp; P. will record a gain of 8 percent to 10 percent this year.</p>
        <p>''As we look at the flow of funds, we don't see nearly as many stocks being bought as over the last several years,'' he said, ''and the stocks that are being bought are not being purchased as aggressively.''</p>
        <p>In addition, although money flowing into equity mutual funds is up 150 percent from a year ago, and funds flowing into aggressive growth funds are up 220 percent, ''those stocks aren't really reacting,'' he added. ''And cash levels are not unusually high.''</p>
        <p>''I am not bearish,'' Mr. Birinyi concluded. ''There are still a lot of situations which look very good. I guess I am rationally exuberant.''</p>
        <p>Big technology stocks like Cisco and Oracle jumped yesterday. Cisco gained 41 5/16, to 59 7/8. Oracle, the database software maker, gained 7 3/16, to 74 3/16.</p>
        <p>Semiconductor manufacturers like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices rallied after a Lehman Brothers analyst issued a bullish report on the industry.</p>
        <p>The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index rose 11.1 percent, its biggest gain in six weeks.</p>
        <p>Advanced Micro soared 11, to 85. Intel surged 8 3/16, to 125 3/4.</p>
        <p>Telephone stocks got a boost from France Telecom's $40 billion acquisition of Orange P.L.C. from Vodafone AirTouch.</p>
        <p>Sprint's PCS wireless unit rose  7/8, to 54 3/8. AT&amp;T's wireless group gained 1 5/16, to 27 5/8. And SBC Communications rose 1 5/8, to 44 1/4.</p>
        <p>VoiceStream Wireless jumped 19 1/2, or 19.4 percent, to 119 7/8, after a Japanese newspaper reported that NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest mobile phone company, was in talks to buy as much as 20 percent of the United States cellular phone company.</p>
        <p>Qualcomm was the most actively traded stock, rising 10 5/16, to 76 3/8. The stock, which rose 27-fold in 1999, is down 60 percent so far this year.</p>
        <p>Financial service did well after analysts at Goldman, Sachs issued a report saying they expect investment banking business to pick up.</p>
        <p>Merrill Lynch gained 3 9/16, to 94 5/8. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette rose 21 1/16, to 39 1/2. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter closed at 67, up 3 5/16, and Goldman Sachs rose 2 3/16, to 72.</p>
        <p>--------------------</p>
        <p>Treasury Prices Fall</p>
        <p>(By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury bond prices fell as stocks surged and as consumer confidence rose to its second-highest level, adding to speculation the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates further to slow growth and inflation.</p>
        <p>''There's no compelling reason to get into Treasuries,'' said Paul Corbin, who helps manage $4.2 billion at the Brown Investment Advisory and Trust Company and two weeks ago bought WorldCom Inc. debt for its higher yields.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 6/32, to 102 6/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.09 percent from 6.06 percent on Friday. The 10-year bond fell 10/32, to 100 30/32, while the yield rose to 6.37 percent from 6.32 percent Friday.</p>
        <p>Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of three-month and six-month bills:</p>
