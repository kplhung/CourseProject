        <p>MAURICIO ALEJOS has spent his life on grass. He played on two national championship soccer teams during the 1980's in his native Guatemala. When his career dipped, he left professional soccer and came to the United States, where he now owns a landscaping business. Making his living on suburban lawns, he's noticed something about his great love.</p>
        <p>''The houses where I go, mowing the lawns, planting flowers, 10 years ago you never saw a soccer ball,'' he said. ''Now you see one in every backyard.''</p>
        <p>He is delighted that the youth of America have discovered soccer. But the question for Mr. Alejos is, where does that leave the men from Latin America?</p>
        <p>Around 7:30 Sunday morning, about 40 Latino men were traipsing across the dew-soaked grass behind the Fox Lane High School, heading for the first of the day's five adult soccer games in the Mount Kisco Soccer League. Like golfers who sleep in their cars to beat the crowds at public courses, the soccer players rose early partly to satisfy a passion, but mostly because it was the only time the grass was theirs.</p>
        <p>The fight for space in the suburbs comes in many guises -- monster mansions versus town houses, S.U.V.'s versus minivans, big box stores versus malls. But the competition for fields of competition has turned feverish with youth soccer still mushrooming and the formation of more and more adult leagues, many made up of Latino immigrants.</p>
        <p>Children, because they are children, come first. But immigrant men, mostly Latino, have a cultural claim on the fields.</p>
        <p>''This is our dream,'' Mr. Alejos said, watching his Kisco United team defeat the Crow Hill Capitals. For some players, Mr. Alejos is both coach and employer. ''I try to give a job to the guys and then they play for me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Alejos also trains young players and has seen the difficulty of getting fields from two perspectives. ''We have no problem with the kids,'' he said. ''But for the adults, it's very hard.''</p>
        <p>Soccer's boom is sometimes compared to the 1970's tennis craze or the growth of ice hockey, but soccer stands out for its cultural passion. Mount Kisco's adult league began three years ago after town officials settled a federal lawsuit alleging discrimination against the town's growing Latino population. Men complained that they were not being allowed to play soccer in Leonard Park, an expansive park in Mount Kisco.</p>
        <p>With 10 adult teams, officials in Mount Kisco and the Bedford Central School District (which serves Mount Kisco and three other towns) are trying to accommodate them while an endless list of other sports beg for fields, from youth soccer and baseball to lacrosse and field hockey.</p>
        <p>IT'S the same elsewhere. White Plains, with 50,000 people, has about 400 adult players in three leagues and about 800 youth players. ''In our leagues we have every South American country represented,'' said Joseph P. Davidson, the city's commissioner of recreation and parks. ''Soccer is their national sport, and they want to play it.''</p>
        <p>Gladys Buitron, the president of the White Plains Scorpion Soccer Club, said city officials made many demands before allowing adults field time for soccer four years ago. Finally, Ms. Buitron said, a local Hispanic leader called officials and said,  ''Let my people play.'' More than 400 people showed up for opening day.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the Hispanics who are coming to the county have very few ways of socializing,'' said Robin A. Bikkal, chairwoman of Westchester County's Hispanic Advisory Board. ''The one bond they all have, other than the language, is soccer.'' A recent board report called for more soccer fields, and the county is considering five new ones, but the soccer players keep on coming.</p>
        <p>Barry Salter, the president of the Westchester Youth Soccer League, said he did not see youths and adults in competition. They're all desperate for fields, he said. Look at his numbers. About five years ago there were 4,500 young players in the county. Now there are 9,000.</p>
        <p>Jorge Alvarado, who came here from Mexico just 13 years ago, remembers how different it once was. He used to travel to Staten Island, Long Island, even Connecticut, just to find players for a game. Now there are too many players, not enough fields. But he'll go where he has to.</p>
        <p>''Let me tell you,'' said Mr. Alvarado, 33, lacing his cleats and tying back his long black hair early Sunday morning, ''when you have the love of this game, you'll go anywhere to play.''</p>
