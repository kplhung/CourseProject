        <p>Kenneth MacMillan's ''Romeo and Juliet'' is in many ways a stunning departure from most narrative ballet. MacMillan made use in his 1965 staging of some theatrical effects in an earlier version by John Cranko. Even more, MacMillan was inspired by the great dramatic dancers Christopher Gable and Lynn Seymour. His  ''Romeo and Juliet,'' presented by American Ballet Theater on Friday and Saturday at the Metropolitan Opera House, still has considerable dramatic impact.</p>
        <p>There is very little actual dancing in the ballet, and MacMillan requires moments of highly effective stillness from his Juliet as the turbulent Prokofiev score boils up around her. But it can be a mistake for dancers to devise complex characterizations. Less is often more here.</p>

        <p>Kenneth MacMillan's ''Romeo and Juliet'' is in many ways a stunning departure from most narrative ballet. MacMillan made use in his 1965 staging of some theatrical effects in an earlier version by John Cranko. Even more, MacMillan was inspired by the great dramatic dancers Christopher Gable and Lynn Seymour. His  ''Romeo and Juliet,'' presented by American Ballet Theater on Friday and Saturday at the Metropolitan Opera House, still has considerable dramatic impact.</p>
        <p>There is very little actual dancing in the ballet, and MacMillan requires moments of highly effective stillness from his Juliet as the turbulent Prokofiev score boils up around her. But it can be a mistake for dancers to devise complex characterizations. Less is often more here.</p>
        <p>Julie Kent and Vladimir Malakhov danced the title roles in the first ''Romeo'' of the season on Friday night with an intelligent appreciation of character. Ms. Kent's Juliet, an introspective tomboy at the start, darted and strode to her fate with poignant fierceness. But she had little to play off in Mr. Malakhov's Romeo, a tremendous baby whom one could foresee skipping town had the two had children. In past seasons Mr. Malakhov has let his exquisite dancing take care of the acting. One misses that.</p>
        <p>Simplicity was the key to the first-rate performances of Ashley Tuttle and Angel Corella on Saturday night. The sweetly eager innocence and passion of Ms. Tuttle's Juliet was communicated in the all-or-nothing arch of her back and the abandon of the spiraling shapes she gave the pas de deux. Mr. Corella's Romeo was an eloquent balance of naturalness and heighted ballet emotions, rushing through his short life in quick-skimming, beautifully phrased turns.</p>
        <p>Young Herman Cornejo nearly stole the show as Mercutio on Saturday. Mr. Cornejo has technique to burn, but it was the easy confidence of that technique that was most impressive. His gut-wrenching pain as the stabbed and dying Mercutio was almost too believable. Sean Stewart's expansively danced Benvolio was another of the evening's pleasures.</p>
        <p>Joaquin De Luz was Friday's endearingly cocky Mercutio, eager for action whether it was hard-fought swordplay or dazzling pirouettes. Marcelo Gomes did not rise much above Benvolio's characteristic blandness. Ethan Brown on Friday and John Gardner on Saturday were more sophisticated Parises than usual. The Harlots were their usual cheerfully silly selves as performed by Erica Cornejo and Sandra Brown (both performances), Erica Fischbach (Friday) and Tamara Barden (Saturday). Eleena Melamed was loving and troubled as Juliet's nurse at both performances.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Georgiadis's looming sets and lavish costumes seemed to engulf the dancers who completed the lead casts. They included Robert Hill and Guillaume Graffin (Tybalt), Christine Dunham and Ms. Fischbach (Lady Capulet), and Michael Owen, David Richardson, Brian Reeder, Irina Dvorovenko and Rosalie O'Connor. Ermanno Florio conducted at both performances.</p>
