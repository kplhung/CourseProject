        <p>The Kellogg Company has realigned creative duties for five global brands between two roster agencies, J. Walter Thompson in New York and the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago.</p>
        <p>Karen Kafer, a spokeswoman for Kellogg in Battle Creek, Mich., confirmed a report of the changes this week in Adweek. Thompson will handle worldwide duties for Corn Flakes and Special K, she said, and Burnett will handle worldwide duties for Froot Loops, Frosted Flakes and NutriGrain Bars. Before the realignment, Burnett had handled creative duties for all five brands in the United States, while those duties overseas had been divided among various agencies.</p>

        <p>The Kellogg Company has realigned creative duties for five global brands between two roster agencies, J. Walter Thompson in New York and the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago.</p>

        <p>Kellogg's global media buying remains divided between Starcom Worldwide in Chicago, which like Burnett is part of the B Com3  Group, and Mindshare in New York, a joint venture of Thompson and its sibling WPP Group agency, Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide. Kellogg declined to discuss worldwide spending for the five brands; the company spent an estimated $675 million last year on advertising all its brands.</p>
