        <p>I suffer from shopping anxiety,  no doubt because nothing looks good on me now that I'm past the age I never thought it was possible to be in the first place. But it doesn't really matter these days anyway, since most women's clothing seems to be designed for skinny 14-year-olds.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, every once in a while, when my children say something like, ''Hey, Mom, the 60's are over,'' as they did a couple of weeks ago, I jump in the minivan and drive to the mall looking for something to update my wardrobe.</p>

        <p>I suffer from shopping anxiety,  no doubt because nothing looks good on me now that I'm past the age I never thought it was possible to be in the first place. But it doesn't really matter these days anyway, since most women's clothing seems to be designed for skinny 14-year-olds.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, every once in a while, when my children say something like, ''Hey, Mom, the 60's are over,'' as they did a couple of weeks ago, I jump in the minivan and drive to the mall looking for something to update my wardrobe.</p>
        <p>This time I didn't do well. At the Gap, the store I've relied on for years to supply me with blue jeans in progressively bigger sizes and white T-shirts in a seemingly inexhaustible variety, I could find nothing but capris -- those tight, above-the-ankle pants that have spread from coast to coast like some terrifying virus.</p>
        <p>Capri pants and the little cropped shirts designed to go with them hung on every hanger, in brilliant yellow, magenta, purple passion, lollipop lime and poppy red. I tried on a few pair.</p>
        <p>''You look cute,'' the saleswoman said as I emerged in one after another pair of the tiny pants and the matching little tops that made me look like a linebacker in fancy dress or, more accurately, a fairly thin, 5-foot-4, middle-aged mom pushing the envelope in a big, big way. Who was she kidding?</p>
        <p>The things weren't even comfortable to begin with, let alone cheap. And what was with my calves, anyway? Why did they look so -- large? My legs are thin, so thin that in high school my best friend called me ''Stick Legs,'' and I used our own 60's fashion must-have, Frye boots, to hide them.</p>
        <p>But now I feel . . . what is the word? Old? Dowdy? But I'm none of the above. Thus I pushed on: Banana Republic, Urban Outfitters, the Limited, Old Navy, Sears. I also needed a bathing suit, but how can a woman locate a bathing suit when the entire mall seems devoted to capri pants?</p>
        <p>What is it with the fashion industry, anyway? Because, suddenly, I saw capri pants not just in the mall, but everywhere: at the grocery store, on the mothers of my children's friends, on my neighbors, and on the women who gathered recently at a fancy art opening for another friend, who was also wearing capri pants. Perhaps, I thought, this was just one of those fashion trends that catches on only among gullible people in Baton Rouge.</p>
        <p>But, no, it seems that actual urban sophisticates, professional women with cell phones and expense accounts, are wearing them, too. My  sister, who lives on the Upper West Side in Manhattan and is a lawyer, reports that Zabar's is full of capri-clad women, and that at her law firm, they have become a staple of casual Friday wardrobes. Lawyers in capris? In Manhattan? Don't they know we're wearing them on the Bayou, too?</p>
        <p>Even my own 6-year-old daughter has a pair. Actually, she is the one person I know who looks good in them. After all, they were made for her.</p>
