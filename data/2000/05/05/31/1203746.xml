        <p>In a day spiked with  attacks on Hillary Rodham Clinton  in speeches, on bumper stickers and on lapel buttons -- the New York Republican Party unanimously selected Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island today to be its candidate for United States Senate. Mr. Lazio seized the platform and promised a hard-hitting campaign, borrowing heavily on Democratic themes and speech lines as he accused Mrs. Clinton of engaging in what he described as ''the politics of division.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, who 10 months ago was forced to the sidelines of the Senate race by party leaders to make way for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, found himself today at the center of  Republican attention, and curiosity, as the party met here to choose its challenger to Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Lazio was selected by acclamation at a convention that was scripted right down to the last seconding speech, and set out to introduce himself both to New York voters and to the delegates who just one week ago had expected to be nominating Mr. Giuliani to be its candidate.</p>
        <p>''When it comes to representing the needs, concerns and values of the people of New York, I have one advantage that she will never have: I can be myself; I am a New Yorker,'' Mr. Lazio said in his 27-minute acceptance speech, summing up what was one of the dominant strains of attack by Republican officeholders and party leaders on the first lady  throughout the day. ''You see for me, New York isn't just a mailing address, it's my home.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said that he would present himself to New York voters as a moderate Republican with ''a vision guided by mainstream principles and compassionate instincts,'' and he stressed his Congressional votes in favor of environmental protection, expanding public housing, and research on breast and cervical cancer. He attacked Mrs. Clinton for seeking to identify him with the ideology of Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, asserting that it was symptomatic of what he called the ''divisive'' political techniques practiced by Democrats since President Clinton came to power.</p>
        <p>''Some in the opposition camp think that they have a winning strategy in repeating Newt Gingrich's name a thousand times between now and November,'' he said. ''Well, let me share with you my winning strategy: Let the other side pursue a politics of discord and division -- I will unite all of New York behind a positive vision for our great state.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio invoked, almost to the precise word, turns of phrases that were used by both President and Mrs. Clinton about Republicans, as he sought, in effect, to pre-emptively discredit his opponent's attacks on him. ''We must not allow the politics of division to dim New York's awesome potential,'' he said. ''I have a goal, of course, and it's winning the race for the United States Senate. But, more important, more important, I want to be worthy of winning. I want to bring New Yorkers together.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio accepted the designation of the party at a convention that was distracted by two events beyond the candidate's control: the absence of Mr. Giuliani, who withdrew from the race on May 19, citing health reasons, and a swollen, stitched lip that Mr. Lazio involuntarily presented to the cameras after stumbling onto his face while marching in a Memorial Day parade on Long Island.</p>
        <p>The injury interfered with Mr. Lazio's ability to kiss babies and seemed to muffle his speech; it also presented, on what was the highest-profile day of his career, a less than camera-worthy image of a candidate whose looks are often cited by Republicans as close to the top of the strengths he brings to his candidacy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's absence was notable, because he was the only major elected Republican in the state who was not on hand for the event. He spent the day in New York City without, unusually, any public schedule. Republicans said that Mr. Giuliani and party leaders decided in talks last week that it was better that the mayor not attend, to avoid the risk of overshadowing Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>That said, his absence today was in keeping with his historically strained relations with state Republican leaders, who, before his withdrawal from the race, had been worried that he was neglecting the upstate region and seemed an unenthusiastic campaigner. Mr. Giuliani learned a month ago that he had prostate cancer, and left the race less than two weeks before this convention. In the process, he irritated many prominent Republicans who were displeased with the amount of time he took to reach the decision to drop out, and with his disclosure during that period that he was seeking a separation from his wife and had started a relationship with another woman.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Giuliani has been dogged in the last few weeks by Republican entreaties to turn over to the party what may amount to as much as $3 million left in his war chest to help Mr. Lazio, and some Republican advisers said the mayor wanted to avoid more queries about his health and his plans.</p>
        <p>The delegates paid tribute to Mr. Giuliani in a standing ovation that was less than overwhelming in sound, and lasted barely 20 seconds.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, described Mr. Lazio's speech today as ''recycled insults and rhetoric that doesn't match his record. Time and time again Rick Lazio has voted against New York's working families in Washington.''</p>
        <p>For all of Mr. Lazio's attacks on Mrs. Clinton for running a divisive campaign, the most notable contrast between the Republican convention today and the Democratic one in Albany two weeks ago was that the Democrats refrained from any attacks on Mr. Giuliani, constrained by his cancer diagnosis and the uncertainty surrounding the race.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mrs. Clinton was in the bull's-eye today, the target for delegates, elected officials, party leaders and Mr. Lazio himself. Delegates wore buttons bearing a picture of her face with a red mark crossed through it. There were $3 bills with Mrs. Clinton's face in the center.</p>
        <p>Within five minutes of the opening of the convention, William D. Powers, the state Republican leader, was attacking her for failing to apologize for an incident in which people attending the Democratic convention reportedly harassed members of the honor guard at the Democratic convention. (Mrs. Clinton wrote a letter to the Police Department deploring the incident, an aide said last night.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki attacked her for failing to pay New York State income taxes since she moved to New York, previewing a line of attack that Republicans plan to use in the campaign ahead. And Mary O. Donohue, the state lieutenant governor, mocked Mrs. Clinton for the way she was presenting herself in her campaign advertisements. ''Let me tell you: Hillary is scared,'' Ms. Donohue said. ''She's so scared she's forgotten her last name.''</p>
        <p>The Republican convention lasted for precisely two hours, and stood in contrast to the more free-wheeling Democratic convention, which took five hours to nominate Mrs. Clinton. The Democratic one in Albany was held at a convention center filled with 11,000 supporters. Today's was held in front of a vastly smaller audience of Republican delegates in a low-ceilinged ballroom at the Hyatt Regency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's aides have said in recent days that he plans to ratchet down his attacks on Mrs. Clinton after a somewhat fierce out-of-the-gate charge this week, out of concern that voters might perceive him as too negative. His speech today tried to address that in two ways: by arguing that Mrs. Clinton was the one responsible for the attacks, and by emphasizing his own record and ideology as strongly as his criticisms of Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''I support lower taxes, responsible spending and an opportunity for everyone: This is my mainstream record and I am proud to run on it,'' he said. ''It is a record of reform and results that leaves no doubt about how I will lead as your senator.''</p>
