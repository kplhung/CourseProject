        <p>Diners denied reservations at the notoriously selective Rao's in East Harlem are finding their way in droves to the new Baldoria, off Times Square. The Midtown expansion by the Pellegrino family does not even officially open until tomorrow, but already West 49th Street is clogged with limos.</p>
        <p>Frank Pellegrino Jr., an owner, says that  so far it's mostly regulars from the 40-seat Rao's who have been making the pilgrimage in hopes of snaring charter membership in this 134-seat unofficial club. One night last week, the old-timers were seated downstairs, where the tin ceilings, booths and a jukebox evoke the uptown restaurant. Upstairs was filled with the new blood.</p>
        <p>Downstairs by the bar were more newcomers, like John De Fillipps and his wife, Jeanette, who were vying for a spot. Of the uptown place, he said: ''We can't get in unless somebody dies. That's why I wanted to get in now.'' He snagged a reservation for this week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pellegrino and his fiancee, Carla Madiera, worked the room, helping people order and making sure everyone was content. In between they smoked feverishly, sneaked kisses and kept the jukebox rolling with a mix of everything from the obvious Frank Sinatra to more contemporary salsa.</p>
        <p>Rao's classics like lemon chicken and rigatoni with prosciutto and onions are all on the menu. But there are a few updates, like a 32-ounce T-bone steak and a raw bar: perhaps they are a rite of passage for a Midtown venture.</p>
