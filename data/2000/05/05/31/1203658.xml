        <p>Senior members of Japan's ruling party are pressing the dominant telecommunications company to cut sharply the high connection fees charged to competitors, an issue that has caused deep trade friction with the United States.</p>
        <p>Telecommunications executives and politicians have been saying over the last week that members of the Liberal Democratic Party, most notably its influential secretary general, Hiromu Nonaka, have been talking to the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation about the fees, which make the cost of doing business here exceedingly expensive for other telephone companies.</p>

        <p>Senior members of Japan's ruling party are pressing the dominant telecommunications company to cut sharply the high connection fees charged to competitors, an issue that has caused deep trade friction with the United States.</p>
        <p>Telecommunications executives and politicians have been saying over the last week that members of the Liberal Democratic Party, most notably its influential secretary general, Hiromu Nonaka, have been talking to the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation about the fees, which make the cost of doing business here exceedingly expensive for other telephone companies.</p>
        <p>The fees are the main reason for stalemated talks on telecommunications deregulation between the United States and Japan.</p>
        <p>There is growing speculation that a deal is in the works to end the stalemate and avoid a major trade dispute before Japan plays host to a summit meeting of leaders from the richest industrialized nations in less than two months.</p>
        <p>N.T.T., the former monopoly in Japan and still its biggest telephone company, controls 99 percent of the lines that connect directly into homes and offices here. The price it charges others to use those lines is critical to opening the telecommunications market in Japan. At current rates, 40 percent of the revenue of competing carriers is consumed in fees to N.T.T., according to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, which regulates the market.</p>
        <p>The United States has threatened to take the matter to the World Trade Organization, a potential escalation in the dispute at a time when Japan's government is working to ensure a smooth summit meeting, which President Clinton will attend.</p>
        <p>Even politicians sympathetic to N.T.T., which has tremendous political influence because of its legions of employees and strong trade union, are trying to coax the former telephone monopoly to make concessions on the fees.</p>
        <p>The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading business daily, said the normally conservative Fair Trade Commission was about to publish a report saying that N.T.T.'s reorganization last year failed to enhance competition in the telecommunications market here and urging sharp cuts in access fees.</p>
        <p>But some worry that in exchange for such cuts N.T.T. may get even more power than it already has and further hamper competition here. Executives at competing carriers, Japanese businessmen and politicians believe that Mr. Nonaka and other senior politicians are promising N.T.T. that they will push for a sweeping revision of the restrictive law -- dating from the time the company was a monopoly -- that governs its activities.</p>
        <p>''There is a move afoot to drastically revise, or even abolish the N.T.T. Law,'' said Kei Hata, a member of the upper house of Parliament who is fast becoming one of the most vocal critics of the way N.T.T. is regulated by the government. ''I myself favor an abolishment of the law, but only after we have secured conditions for free and fair competition.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hata and many others say those conditions do not yet exist in Japan. Abolishing the N.T.T. law would open the door for NTT East and NTT West, the two regional fixed-line phone companies in the N.T.T. family, to provide long-distance and international service, and many worry that with the advantages of N.T.T.'s financial resources and existing technology, they would wipe out competitors that are only just beginning to secure a toehold in the market.</p>
        <p>''We need to think more about the implications of changing the law,'' Ms. Hata said.</p>
        <p>N.T.T.'s recent financial performance, which was far better than the company had projected, undercut its contention that it would be crippled by major reductions in access fees of the magnitude the United States is demanding. Nor did Junichiro Miyazu, N.T.T.'s president, further his company's cause by saying he could not explain the markedly better performance. His insistence that declining profitability at NTT East and NTT West was a trend also rang somewhat hollow, as both of them did surprisingly well.</p>
        <p>''The earnings of the regional carriers improved,'' Eita Yashiro, minister of posts and telecommunications, said at a news conference today. ''It's very different from the initial projections.''</p>
        <p>In light of that, he said his agency would consider the reduction in interconnection fees it has proposed, as well as the proposed timetable for achieving those reductions. Japan has proposed cutting the fees by 22.5 percent over four years, saying further cuts would damage N.T.T.</p>
        <p>The United States, however, wants cuts of 41.1 percent immediately and has said the ministry is helping N.T.T. avoid a far-reaching overhaul of its business.</p>
