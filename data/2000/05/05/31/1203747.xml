        <p>For the last five months, the union representing New York City teachers has been peppering newspapers, radio and prime-time television with advertisements that make a powerful argument for raising salaries: city teachers earn a whopping 25 percent less than those in the surrounding suburbs, the ads say.</p>
        <p>The union is preparing to negotiate a new contract with the city, and it is hoping to rally public support with the $3 million worth of ominous ads.

        <p>For the last five months, the union representing New York City teachers has been peppering newspapers, radio and prime-time television with advertisements that make a powerful argument for raising salaries: city teachers earn a whopping 25 percent less than those in the surrounding suburbs, the ads say.</p>
        <p>The union is preparing to negotiate a new contract with the city, and it is hoping to rally public support with the $3 million worth of ominous ads. One claims that as a result of the salary gap, ''many experienced teachers in New York City are being cherry-picked'' by suburban school districts. Another declares that the salary gap is ''why we are facing a crisis of unmatched proportion,'' a reference to the union's prediction that 54,000 teachers will leave city schools over the next five years.</p>
        <p>But the facts are more complicated than the advertisements let on. An analysis of salary data compiled by the state teachers' union found that while some school districts in Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland and Orange Counties pay up to 40 percent more in some experience levels than New York City, those districts are the exception to the rule. In the 1998-99 school year, the starting salaries in those counties were only about 12 percent higher on average, according to the data.</p>
        <p>The average entry-level salary in those counties was $34,068 in 1998-99, compared with $30,203 in New York City. Nassau County paid the highest starting salary -- $38,122 for teachers with a bachelor's degree and no  experience. Orange County's average starting salary, $32,794, was only 8.6 percent higher than New York City's.</p>
        <p>The gap was larger among more experienced and more educated teachers. In their first year on the job, teachers with master's degrees and 30 additional credits earned an average of $41,236 in Westchester County -- about 21 percent higher than the $34,117 their counterparts earned in New York City. First-year teachers with master's degrees earned $43,268 in Nassau County -- about 27 percent more than those in New York.</p>
        <p>The highest-paid teachers -- those with the highest education levels and the most years on the job -- earned an average of $81,666 in the five suburban counties last year, more than 29 percent above the average $63,037 in New York City.</p>
        <p>Randi Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, maintains that the union's advertisements are not exaggerating when they talk about a 25 percent gap between city and suburban salaries. She pointed to a report last year by the State Education Department, which found that the median teacher salary in New York City was 39.96 percent less than in Nassau County, 49.38 percent less than in Rockland County and 44.47 percent less than in Westchester County.</p>
        <p>The numbers are higher than those based on averages partly because suburban school systems tend to have more experienced teachers than New York City. That makes the median salary in suburban districts significantly higher. A median salary is one that falls in the exact middle of a ranked payroll; half the teachers earn more and half less.</p>
        <p>''It would not be my style to exaggerate a gap that's already too big,'' Ms. Weingarten said about the 25 percent figure that the union is using in its ads. ''There are many different ways to construe average salaries, but this is an honest estimate.''</p>
        <p>Another contention in some of the ads -- that ''many experienced teachers'' are being ''cherry-picked'' by suburban school districts -- may be more misleading. In response to a lawsuit in which more state aid is being sought for city schools, state lawyers recently presented data suggesting only a few hundred teachers leave New York City for suburban schools each year.</p>
        <p>The data, provided by the State Education Department, found that 259 city teachers left for suburban districts from 1996 to 1997, while 395 left from 1997 to 1998. If those numbers are correct, the New York City school system -- which has 75,000 teachers -- is hardly experiencing an exodus of teachers to the suburbs. One major reason may be that from year to year there are generally only a handful of openings in any one suburban district.</p>
        <p>''It's true that the number who actually leave is not huge,'' said Michael Rebell, a lawyer for the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, a coalition of advocacy groups that filed the school financing lawsuit. ''The bigger problem is getting teachers to come here in the first place. It's pretty clear that the salary differential, plus the harder working conditions in city schools, make the suburbs much more attractive.''</p>
        <p>During the school financing trial, state lawyers also suggested that suburban districts paid teachers more because they required longer hours than New York City did. But New York City union officials say that those additional hours are generally for preparation or professional development, not for teaching.</p>
        <p>Ms. Weingarten said the union based its ads on anecdotal evidence about teachers leaving for the suburbs, because it was difficult for the union to collect accurate figures on teachers who leave city schools.</p>
        <p>The union's fight for higher salaries might be bolstered by a study about to be published by Dr. Hamilton Lankford, an economics professor at the State University of New York in Albany. The study found New York City was the only large city in New York State to pay its teachers less than the surrounding suburbs.</p>
        <p>The most striking example is Yonkers, where new teachers will earn $40,068 under a new contract and teachers with the most training and experience will earn $90,311. The new starting salary is 30 percent higher than Westchester's average starting salary in 1998-99, the latest year for which figures are available. The new top salary is 6.4 percent higher than the county's average top salary of $84,912 in 1998-99.</p>
        <p>Certified teachers who are new to the profession are the ones most likely to flee to the suburbs, union officials said, because they have the least invested in the city's pension system. New York City cannot afford to lose those teachers, they said, not only because so many older teachers are retiring but because young, inexperienced teachers are the most likely to teach in hard-to-staff schools.</p>
        <p>No matter how much salaries here increase, suburban schools are going to remain enticing for city teachers because of their smaller classes, newer buildings, more plentiful supplies and general tranquility. Kelly Orr, 31, left Public School 108 in South Ozone Park, Queens, last fall for a middle-class school district in Nassau County. Mrs. Orr, a remedial math teacher, is making $48,572 at her new school -- roughly $10,000 more than she did in Queens.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Orr said that while the main reason she went to Long Island was the higher salaries, another was smaller classes. She started out last fall with 39 students in her sixth-grade class at P.S. 108, she said. The sixth-grade classes at her new school have about 22 students each.</p>
        <p>''A salary of $38,000 for a sixth-year teacher with a master's degree was just not sufficient,'' Mrs. Orr said. ''When you're 30 years old and you've got all this education and you're still not making ends meet, you don't have much choice. I had to go.''</p>
