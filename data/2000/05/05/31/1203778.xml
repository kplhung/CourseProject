        <p>Salespeople account for one of every nine jobs in America--and their numbers will continue to grow; Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that number of sales and marketing workers will increase by 2.3 million, to 17.6 million, in 2008 from 15.3 million in 1998; graph (M)</p>

        <p>Whether they ring up shirts and sweaters on a cash register, stock groceries on shelves or show homes to potential buyers, America's salespeople are the worker ants of the booming economy. There are a lot of them -- they account for one of every nine jobs in America -- and their numbers will continue to grow.</p>
        <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that the number of sales and marketing workers will increase by 2.3 million, to 17.6 million, in 2008 from 15.3 million in 1998. And the job creation will be fastest for the highest earners, the bureau says. The ranks of financial-services sales agents, a group that includes stockbrokers and financial advisers and whose average annual pay exceeds $60,000, will surge 41 percent, to 427,000, the agency said. That compares with an average projected growth rate for the overall sales force of 14 percent.</p>

        <p>Store clerks and cashiers will continue to form the backbone of the business, though their numbers will rise at a slower clip, to 9 million from 7.7 million, according to the bureau. Much of their work is low-skilled -- with pay to match: cashiers earned an average $15,230 a year in 1998, or about one-third the $47,600 that the average chief executive of a large company made in a single business day last year.</p>
