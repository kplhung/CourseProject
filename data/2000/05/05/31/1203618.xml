        <p>STEVE JOHNSON, the chef at the Blue Room in Cambridge, Mass., has been cooking skirt steak for years, long before it became wildly popular. But never before has he served a better -- or simpler -- rendition of this long, thin band of wonderfully marbled beef.</p>
        <p>His secret: a slice of compound butter, flavored with shallots, chives and thyme, that melts over the meat.</p>
        <p>It had been so long since I had seen flavored butter on steak that this version came as something of a revelation.</p>
        <p>Until butter became a forbidden food, it was common as a flavor booster. In classic cooking, compound butters were kept on hand and often used to enhance rich sauces. But more recently, they have become more common on their own, topping not only steak, but also leaner meats like veal and chicken, and even fish. (And their side dishes, too: place a little flavored butter on plain rice or steamed carrots and you'll be considered brilliant.)</p>
        <p>Compound butters are easy to make, and as Mr. Johnson pointed out, they can be frozen and used as needed, allowing a home cook to develop and execute signature dishes on the spot. Just form the butter into a log, wrap it well, freeze it and cut slices for anything grilled, broiled or even steamed.</p>
        <p>Start with unsalted butter (any good brand will do fine, as long as it is fresh). Compound butters can be made with various seasonings: at this time of the year, fresh herbs are a good candidate -- chervil, dill and parsley are all nice -- and roasted garlic puree can be sensational. Mustard, ginger, vinegar, chilies or citrus juice and zest work well, too.</p>
        <p>Seasonings can also be combined. A teaspoon each of horseradish or wasabi, ginger and soy sauce can be mixed into a stick of butter (add salt and pepper sparingly). Or add a teaspoon each of minced garlic, fresh oregano and lemon juice (add salt and plenty of ground black pepper, and if you are using roasted garlic, increase the quantity to a tablespoon). Other combinations include chili-cilantro: for each stick of butter add one small stemmed, seeded and minced chili, a tablespoon of minced cilantro and a teaspoon of lime juice, along with salt and ground pepper.</p>
        <p>The simplest way to make a compound butter is to mince the flavorings and cream them with the butter, using a fork. Butter that is slightly soft is best, but if it is cold (or frozen), use a small food processor. You'll never get all the butter out of the container and blade, but the process will take just seconds.</p>
        <p>As for skirt steak, it has become almost ubiquitous. The price ranges as high as $10 a pound, but it can often be found in supermarkets for well under half that.</p>
        <p>Cut from the cow's diaphragm, skirt steak is juicy and flavorful but not exactly tender; it's chewier than good strip steak  and does not respond well to overcooking.</p>
        <p>If someone at the table insists on having it  cooked beyond medium-rare, even the compound butter won't save it.</p>
        <p>SKIRT STEAK WITH SHALLOT-THYME BUTTER  Time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>1/4 pound unsalted butter, softened slightly</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves  10 chives, minced  1 shallot, peeled and minced  Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon red wine vinegar or lemon juice  About 24 ounces skirt steak, cut into 4 portions</p>
        <p>1. Prepare a gas or charcoal grill; the fire should be so hot you can hold your hand over it for only a couple of seconds.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, cream the butter with a fork,  adding thyme, chives, shallot,  1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper and the vinegar or juice.</p>
        <p>3. Grill the steak, 2 minutes a side for rare, about a minute longer per side for medium-rare. As it cooks, season with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>4. Spread each steak with about a tablespoon of the flavored butter, and serve. Remaining butter can be wrapped and refrigerated or frozen.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
