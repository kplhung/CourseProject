        <p>Using desperation as their sixth man, the Portland Trail Blazers surprised the Los Angeles Lakers, 96-88, tonight at the Staples Center and forced the Western Conference finals to a Game 6. The Trail Blazers followed the lead of their two stars, Scottie Pippen and Rasheed Wallace, who combined to hit the Lakers with a tenacity that wasn't there while Portland fell behind, three games to one, in the four-of-seven-game series.</p>
        <p>Pippen scored 22 points and had 6 steals and 4 blocked shots. Wallace had 22 points and 10 rebounds.</p>

        <p>Using desperation as their sixth man, the Portland Trail Blazers surprised the Los Angeles Lakers, 96-88, tonight at the Staples Center and forced the Western Conference finals to a Game 6. The Trail Blazers followed the lead of their two stars, Scottie Pippen and Rasheed Wallace, who combined to hit the Lakers with a tenacity that wasn't there while Portland fell behind, three games to one, in the four-of-seven-game series.</p>
        <p>Pippen scored 22 points and had 6 steals and 4 blocked shots. Wallace had 22 points and 10 rebounds.</p>
        <p>''Once I set the precedent of being aggressive early, I knew my teammates would follow,'' said Pippen, who bruised his hand while landing on the court after a collision with Robert Horry. ''It was just a matter of making sure we stayed steady and continued that throughout the game.''</p>
        <p>The Trail Blazers turned back every Laker rally and fiercely protected the 80-67 lead they held through four quarters. Los Angeles came within 9, at 87-78, with  6 minutes 18 seconds to play, but got no closer as the Lakers lost for the second time at home in this series.</p>
        <p>With a chance to reach the National Basketball Association finals for the first time since 1991, the Lakers fell flat on their jump shots, making only 38 percent. Shaquille O'Neal led Los Angeles with 31 points and 21  rebounds. Kobe Bryant, playing with five fouls for most of the fourth quarter, had 17 points.</p>
        <p>Glen Rice and Robert Horry combined for 4-of-19 shooting. The Lakers also made only 6 of 27 3-point  attempts.</p>
        <p>''We shot too may 3-point shots,'' Lakers Coach Phil Jackson said, ''and ended up standing on the perimeter too much trying to get the ball to Shaq and not finding a way. You have to give Portland credit for that.''</p>
        <p>Portland shot 43 percent.</p>
        <p>''Our defense has been strong this series, except for a few lapses,'' said  Trail Blazers Coach Mike Dunleavy. ''Tonight, we really didn't have any for a few lapses. Tonight, we really didn't have any breakdowns. It made a big difference for us.''</p>
        <p>Jackson said: ''We're going to have to take a little more time to win this series. It'll be good for us. It'll force us to grow even more as a team.''</p>
        <p>After fighting off a 10-point surge by O'Neal, the Trail Blazers broke down the Lakers late in the third quarter. They finished with an 8-0 run, sparked by Steve Smith's jump shot and Wallace's two free throws, before Detlef Schrempf ended the scoring with a layup and two free throws with 1.3 seconds left following a foul by Rick Fox.</p>
        <p>The Trail Blazers threatened to blow out the Lakers midway through the third quarter, three times taking 9-point leads. But O'Neal took charge, scoring 10 straight points and making a full-court pass to Horry to pull the Lakers within 5, at 70-65, with 2:30 remaining.</p>
        <p>The Lakers made a quick 10-5 run early in the third quarter after Arvydas Sabonis's jump shot gave Portland a 57-47 lead. Bryant hit a 3-pointer, O'Neal had two baskets and a free throw, and Ron Harper sank a jumper to pull the Lakers within 5, at 62-57.</p>
        <p>The Trail Blazers shot 50 percent in the first half, yet managed only a 53-45 lead. Pippen, who led Portland with 15 points in the half, took only one shot in the second quarter, a 3-pointer that beat the horn and set up a familiar situation for the Lakers.</p>
        <p>Once again, the Lakers played a mediocre first half, this time missing 31-of-45 attempts to shoot only 31 percent. Once again, they stayed within striking range, this time by making 14-of-15 free throws. O'Neal scored 15 points and Bryant had 8 points despite hitting only 1-of-7 shots. Horry was 0 of 6 and Rice was 1 of 4.</p>
        <p>A dunk by O'Neal and two free throws by Bryant cut the Trail Blazers' lead to 48-45, but a basket by Wallace and Pippen's late 3-pointer lifted Portland's lead back to 8 points. Wallace had 11 points and 7 rebounds in the first half.</p>
        <p>As they did in the first halves of Game 3 and 4, the Trail Blazers seized the momentum, and they took an early 10-point lead. Bonzi Wells hit a 3-pointer and Sabonis followed with a jump shot to put Portland ahead by 40-30 with 7:21 to play in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>O'Neal continued his smooth touch at the free-throw line, making 3-of-4 attempts in the first half to go with 9 of 9 from Game 4. From the field, O'Neal was 6 of 14 with 9 rebounds.</p>
        <p>Pippen played a near-flawless first quarter, scored 12 points to help the Trail Blazers take a 26-24 lead.</p>
