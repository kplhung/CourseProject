        <p>With Air Force One scheduled to land in Moscow later this week, President Clinton still has not faced the fact that his policy of ''engagement'' with Russia has become a colossal disappointment. But in his visit to Moscow, he will encounter that reality face to face, when he is greeted by President Vladimir Putin, a former colonel in the K.G.B., the son of a party apparatchik as well of the grandson of a trusted member of Lenin's and then Stalin's personal detail.</p>
        <p>Let it be said that in the area of relations with Russia, Mr. Clinton deserves some credit. The denuclearization of Ukraine and Belarus and the reductions of strategic forces by both the United States and Russia were negotiated with persistence and success. Ukraine's independence has been strongly supported. The United States expanded its relations with independent states in the southern Caucasus and Central Asia. Most important, under Mr. Clinton's leadership, NATO was enlarged eastward, and the administration has pledged to continue that expansion, including the Baltic states.</p>

        <p>With Air Force One scheduled to land in Moscow later this week, President Clinton still has not faced the fact that his policy of ''engagement'' with Russia has become a colossal disappointment. But in his visit to Moscow, he will encounter that reality face to face, when he is greeted by President Vladimir Putin, a former colonel in the K.G.B., the son of a party apparatchik as well of the grandson of a trusted member of Lenin's and then Stalin's personal detail.</p>
        <p>Let it be said that in the area of relations with Russia, Mr. Clinton deserves some credit. The denuclearization of Ukraine and Belarus and the reductions of strategic forces by both the United States and Russia were negotiated with persistence and success. Ukraine's independence has been strongly supported. The United States expanded its relations with independent states in the southern Caucasus and Central Asia. Most important, under Mr. Clinton's leadership, NATO was enlarged eastward, and the administration has pledged to continue that expansion, including the Baltic states.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, however, the policy of ''engagement'' with Russia has deteriorated into a one-sided courtship. No longer is the Clinton administration striking a balance between positive inducements and negative pressures. The administration not only endorsed Boris Yeltsin's bombardment of the Russian parliament in 1993, but persisted in hailing Mr. Yeltsin as a tested democrat, even though his erratic presidency was a mixture of anarchy and authoritarianism. Sadly, doing so discredited the very meaning of the word democracy in the eyes of many Russians.</p>
        <p>The policy of engagement hit a low with Mr. Putin. Though his election in March was precipitated by an arrangement whereby Mr. Yeltsin resigned the presidency and Mr. Putin became acting president, and no real alternative candidate was available to the Russian people, the White House praised the election, hailing it as the country's first democratic transfer of power in Russia's nearly 1,000-year existence. It even hailed Mr. Putin himself as a ''reformer,'' despite some justifiable concern about his background. Mr. Putin's prompt appointment of five secret police and military officials -- one is widely known as a specialist in suppressing dissent -- as supergovernors was quietly ignored.</p>
        <p>In the years leading up to this ''election,'' the Clinton administration financially supported and promoted economic reforms in Russia that enriched only a few, including some top Russian leaders. The resulting pervasive corruption was simply ignored until Western and Russian news media exposed it -- and even then, the administration did not alter its policy.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration excused and even justified two Russian wars against the Chechen people. President Clinton compared the Russian campaign to Lincoln's efforts to preserve American unity and proclaimed, to widespread criticism, that the war's objective was ''to liberate Grozny.''</p>
        <p>The summit this weekend, if not handled properly, poses new risks. First, President Clinton, in his eagerness to embrace a ''democratic'' Russia, could reach a hastily contrived agreement regarding missile defense that may undermine stable strategic deterrence while prompting allied disunity. Such a quick deal -- designed as a defense against North Korea -- could precipitate China's efforts to upgrade its nuclear forces and ignite allied fears that the United States is seeking security for itself alone.</p>
        <p>Second, Mr. Putin could seek to enlist the United States in his effort to assume the role of protector of the Central Asian regimes against fundamentalist pressures emanating from Afghanistan. He would like support for  a Russian-sponsored anti-Islamic coalition that would regain a dominant role for Russia in that region.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton must not once again be so hasty in extolling the new Russian president as a democratic reformer. A dose of dignified restraint, based on a realistic assessment of where Russia is headed, could help redeem a policy of ''engagement'' that has gradually lost its way. It is not too late.</p>
