      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Supreme Court today expanded its continuing review of the Clean Air Act by agreeing to decide whether the statute requires the government to look beyond the public health benefits of reducing air pollution and consider the economic costs as well.</p>
        <p>The court's action raised the stakes even higher in a case, to be argued next fall, that already promised to be one of the most important environmental and administrative law cases in years.</p>
        <p>Last week the justices agreed to hear the Clinton administration's appeal of a ruling by the federal appeals court here that the Clean Air Act, as interpreted by the Environmental Protection Agency, handed such broad authority of a legislative nature to the administrative agency as to amount to an unconstitutional ''delegation'' by Congress of its lawmaking power.</p>
        <p>Acting today in the same case, the court granted a separate appeal, filed by the United States Chamber of Commerce and a group of regulated industries, that asked the justices to examine the Clean Air Act from a different perspective.</p>
        <p>If the court were to read a broad cost-benefit requirement into the agency's rule-making authority, the business groups said, the whole delegation question could be avoided, because the cost-benefit requirement ''could functionally serve as the necessary intelligible principle'' to preserve the law's constitutionality.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration had argued against granting the business groups' appeal, characterizing it as an invitation to a judicial override of a choice that Congress had already made. In enacting the Clean Air Act, the administration told the court, Congress ''reasonably concluded'' that pollution standards ''should be based on health and welfare considerations alone so that Congress and the public know that E.P.A.'s judgments on the health and welfare threats posed by particular criteria pollutants are not compromised by considerations of economic and technical feasibility.''</p>
        <p>At issue in the case are new standards, set by the agency in 1997, for ozone and small airborne particles. The administration's appeal is Browner v. American Trucking Associations, No. 99-1257, and the appeal granted today is American Trucking Associations v. Browner, No. 99-1426.</p>
        <p>In invalidating the new standards in its ruling last year, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the Environmental Protection Agency lacked ''any determinate criteria for drawing lines'' and had ''failed to state intelligibly how much is too much.'' The opinion, by Judge Stephen F. Williams, suggested strongly that a cost-benefit analysis could supply such criteria.</p>
        <p>But Judge Williams said the appeals court was constrained by its own precedent, a 1980 decision known as the Lead Industries case that specifically barred the agency from considering any factor other than public health. Only the Supreme Court was in a position to set that decision aside.</p>
        <p>Although it declined to review Lead Industries when the decision was issued, the Supreme Court is familiar with the cost-benefit issue from a series of regulatory battles in the early 1980's involving the Occupational Safety and Health Act. In a 1980 case, for instance, a deeply splintered court struck down the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's standard for exposure to benzene, holding that although the agency did not have to engage in full cost-benefit analysis to justify new regulations, it did have to make a preliminary finding that existing exposure levels posed ''a significant risk of harm.'' That requirement presented a limiting principle that would avoid a finding of undue delegation, the court said then.</p>
        <p>In an interview today, Edward W. Warren, a lawyer here who won the benzene case 20 years ago and will argue for the business groups in this case, said his clients were not asking the court to adopt a ''technocratic, lives-for-dollars'' analysis of the Clean Air Act or to use the case as a vehicle to ''transform the administrative state.'' He said it was possible to interpret the statute as making public health the primary consideration, with cost considerations coming in only at the point of selecting among alternative strategies.</p>
        <p>For purposes of the case, the most relevant phrases of the Clean Air Act are those that instruct the administrator of the E.P.A. to set air quality standards that while ''allowing an adequate margin of safety, are requisite to protect the public health.''</p>
        <p>There are no completely safe levels, above zero, of the pollutants that the law regulates. According to the business groups' brief, the phrase ''adequate margin of safety'' suggests that the agency ''must trade off the costs and benefits of additional safety, just as designers strive to engineer 'adequate' -- but never complete -- safety into every product they design.''</p>
        <p>There were also these developments at the court today:</p>
        <p>Church Arson</p>
        <p>After its ruling last week that the federal arson law does not apply to arson of a private residence, the court ordered two federal appeals courts to reconsider whether the law applies to arson of a church. In one case, Rea v. United States, No. 99-6136, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis, found that a church annex, used as a schoolhouse and for other activities, was sufficiently connected with interstate commerce to be covered by the law.</p>
        <p>But the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, almost simultaneously vacated a man's guilty plea for burning a church. In that case, United States v. Johnson, No. 99-1266, the appeals court said the government had not shown that the Hopewell United Methodist Church in Centerville, Tex., had the ''explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce'' necessary for federal jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>In its unanimous decision last week, Jones v. United States, No. 99-5739, the court held that Congress did not intend the arson law, which requires that a building be ''used'' in an activity affecting commerce, to apply to a house used as a private residence.</p>
        <p>If the appeals courts disagree on how the ruling applies to churches or other types of buildings, there is a good prospect for further Supreme Court decisions.</p>
        <p>Potomac River Dispute</p>
        <p>Exercising its infrequently used ''original jurisdiction'' to resolve suits between states, the court said it would allow Virginia to proceed with a suit against Maryland over use of the Potomac River, which forms a border between the two. Maryland owns the river, under a grant from King Charles I of England in 1632, but under various interstate compacts Virginia has been allowed to make ''reasonable use'' of the Potomac from its own shoreline, including the construction of pipes to draw river water for drinking.</p>
        <p>Virginia brought this case, Virginia v. Maryland, No. 129 Original, to protest Maryland's refusal to allow the Fairfax County Water Authority to build a new intake pipe from the shoreline to a point in the main channel, 725 feet offshore. The county authority says the new pipe is needed because the current intake pipe, at the shoreline, is subject to runoff, clogging by leaves or ice, and other problems that would not occur near the middle of the 2,000-foot-wide river.</p>
        <p>Maryland unsuccessfully urged the court not to accept jurisdiction, on the ground that administrative proceedings were still going on that could resolve the dispute without involving the Supreme Court. The justices are likely to appoint a special master to take evidence and recommend a resolution.</p>
