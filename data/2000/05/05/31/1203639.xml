        <p>So many wedding cakes are more like sculpture than pastry: dry layers mortared with dull fillings, a plaster of sugary icing and a price worthy of a Chelsea gallery. Now Martin Bernier, a partner in Food Attitude, a wholesale bakery based on Long Island, has set up weddingcakeonline.com. Mr. Bernier and his partners, who include a former pastry chef at Le Bernardin, streamlined the process to keep the prices reasonable, at $4 or $6 a portion. Their showroom, at 235 East 25th Street, displays more than a dozen designs. Couples can choose the type of icing and its color: only roses are available for decoration. But what really distinguishes the cakes are the flavors and fillings: they are delicious, with combinations like vanilla-almond meringue with cassis cream and chocolate ganache or chocolate dacquoise with hazelnut cream. The cakes can be ordered with a week's notice. Visits to the showroom are by appointment only: (212) 686-4644.</p>
