        <p>The odds were impossibly high, but the jackpot was higher. Even so, two winners, one in Michigan and one in Illinois, beat the odds and will share the biggest lottery jackpot ever in the United States.</p>
        <p>Lottery officials said neither winner of the $366 million, seven-state drawing, the Big Game, came forward today after Tuesday night's drawing. They have a year to do so.</p>
        <p>For weeks the race to capture the surging jackpot sent people in Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and Virginia rushing to liquor stores and gas stations, all with the hope of becoming the 1 out of 76 million lucky enough to match all six numbers and win the record prize.</p>
        <p>The winning numbers were 1, 2, 12, 33, 37 and Big Money Ball 4.</p>
        <p>''I was hoping I would be the one,'' said George Kassab, the owner of Mr. K's Party Shoppe near Utica, about 20 miles north of Detroit, where the winning Michigan ticket was bought. Mr. Kassab bought 20 tickets himself. But he will have to settle for a $2,000 bonus check from lottery officials for selling more than 5,000 Big Game tickets.</p>
        <p>Michigan lottery officials said that they received a call from a man who appeared to have the winning ticket but that he would not give details about himself.</p>
        <p>Randy Kattola, a clerk at Mr. K's, said the store also received a call from a man identifying himself as the winner.</p>
        <p>''He said he only spent $100 and it was his first time playing ever,'' Mr. Kattola said, adding, ''I hope he gives us a big tip.''</p>
        <p>While Illinois lottery officials were also trying to determine the identity of the winner there, they were able to award one prize today: a $1.8 million check to John Sweeney, the owner of a gas station in the Chicago suburb of Lake Zurich, where the other winning ticket was bought.</p>
        <p>Illinois awards 1 percent of the jackpot to the store owner who sells the winning ticket; other states, like Michigan, give only nominal bonuses.</p>
        <p>''I've always joked that it's been one of my dreams to sell a winning lottery ticket,'' said Ginny Gallagher, the assistant manager who sold the winning ticket and spent most of today talking to reporters.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gallagher said officials had  determined that the ticket was sold from 1 to 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''Business here has always been good,'' she said. ''Now it's just going to get better.''</p>
        <p>And so, probably, will life for the anonymous millionaire ticket holders. The winners will probably take home about $7 million a year for the next 26 years.</p>
        <p>The last time the nation was gripped by such record lottery frenzy was two years ago, when 13 Ohio machinists shared a $295.7 million Powerball jackpot. In December the Spanish lottery El Gordo, or the Fat One, set a world lottery record of $1.2 billion. But unlike the Big Game jackpot, El Gordo spreads the jackpot out among thousands of winners.</p>
