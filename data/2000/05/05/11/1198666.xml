        <p>A review for the large account of an Internet company, Lycos, has taken an unusual twist.</p>
        <p>Donny Deutsch, chief executive at Deutsch Inc. in New York, said that he had declined a request from Lycos to have his agency's new Boston office handle the account, with billings estimated at $25 million. That request, he said, came even after he had decided to withdraw from the review after it had been narrowed to Deutsch Boston and one other finalist, Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
        <p>''We pulled out of the review, and they did offer us the account, and we respectfully declined,'' Mr. Deutsch said, confirming reports in Adweek about the agency's decision. He declined to comment further.</p>
        <p>Brian Payea, a spokesman for Lycos in Waltham, Mass., declined to comment on the status of the review. Adweek reported that Deutsch Boston had left the review because a copy of its creative presentation had been shared by Lycos executives with Hill, Holliday, whose chief executive, Jack Connors, is a member of the Lycos board.</p>
        <p>The review began in mid-March. The previous agency for Lycos was the New York office of the Bozell Group, part of True North Communications, which had handled the account since 1996.</p>
