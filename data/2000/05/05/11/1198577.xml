        <p>Random House, the nation's top trade publisher of popular books, and Audible Inc., an Internet audio company, have signed an agreement to begin selling digitized audio books online, the companies plan to announce today.</p>
        <p>The alliance will create a new imprint, called Random House Audible, that will try to convince consumers to download from the Web audio material, ranging from existing Random House books to historical material, like speeches, to new, specialized content like business books. Listeners would then hear the books through their computer or by using a portable device like an MP3 player.</p>

        <p>Random House, the nation's top trade publisher of popular books, and Audible Inc., an Internet audio company, have signed an agreement to begin selling digitized audio books online, the companies plan to announce today.</p>
        <p>The alliance will create a new imprint, called Random House Audible, that will try to convince consumers to download from the Web audio material, ranging from existing Random House books to historical material, like speeches, to new, specialized content like business books. Listeners would then hear the books through their computer or by using a portable device like an MP3 player.</p>
        <p>The venture will be the first instance of a publisher's selling new audio material through the Web, rather than offering existing audio books in a digital form as well, said Paul Rush, the president of both the Audio Publishers Association and Earful of Books, a Dallas-based chain of stores that sell books on tape.</p>
        <p>Random House Audible will be able to release audio books more quickly -- to respond to a news event, for example -- and will probably inspire similar moves by other publishers, he added.</p>
        <p>''For our industry, it is a major event,'' Mr. Rush said.</p>
        <p>Jenny Frost, the president of the Random House audio publishing group, said that the new imprint would focus on material with a narrower audience than the company's current list of audio titles. That list includes books by John Grisham and Danielle Steele and the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling.</p>
        <p>''Our programming doesn't have to support two inches on a shelf in a bookstore anymore,'' Ms. Frost said.</p>
        <p>The new imprint could also serialize books more easily than the existing audio division, which is Random House's fastest-growing group, Ms. Frost said. For example, Random House Audible would not have had to wait to release Mr. Grisham's recent serialized novel until all of the chapters had been published, said Jonathan Korzen, a spokesman for Audible.</p>
        <p>Books that sell particularly well over the Web may later be sold as tapes and compact discs, Mr. Korzen said.</p>
        <p>The companies expect to sell their first digitized audio book this summer. The books will typically cost about 20 percent less than audio books available on tape or CD's, Ms. Frost said.</p>
        <p>The new kind of books will not be as easy to listen to as the old versions, however. After downloading a book from the Internet, listeners will be able to hear it through their desktop computer, a hand-held computer run with Microsoft software or the Diamond Multimedia Rio MP3 player.</p>
        <p>Audible will, however, encrypt the audio material so that consumers cannot listen to it on a tape player, CD player or the most popular brand of hand-held computers, 3Com's Palm, Mr. Korzen said.</p>
