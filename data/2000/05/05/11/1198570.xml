        <p>In its first report on its compliance with the United Nations Convention Against Torture, the United States today defended its efforts to eliminate any such practices, including police brutality and inmate abuse, which human rights advocates maintain are regular occurrences in America.</p>
        <p>The United States, like the 117 other countries that have signed the 1984 convention, is obliged to detail to the body's review committee every four years incidents of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of its citizens and to describe the steps taken to stamp out such practices.</p>
        <p>Although the United States ratified the convention in 1994, this was its first report to the United Nations committee monitoring compliance. Still, Harold H. Koh, the assistant secretary of state for human rights, told the committee that the 74-page report ''makes clear our unequivocal and unambiguous condemnation of torture as a tool of governmental policy.''</p>
        <p>Human rights groups disagreed. On Tuesday, Amnesty International filed its own 45-page report with the torture committee that described specific cases that it said violated the international pact.</p>
        <p>Since 1994, Amnesty officials said they had documented ''numerous instances of the torture or ill treatment of men, women and children by U.S. police or custody officials as well as cruel, inhuman and degrading prison conditions,'' and mistreatment ''disproportionately directed at racial and ethnic minorities.''</p>
        <p>Such incidents are ''fast becoming institutionalized across the country,'' said William F. Schulz, executive director of Amnesty's United States branch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koh conceded today that there are ''continuing areas of concern within the United States.''</p>
        <p>''Although our commitment is unambiguous, our record is not perfect,'' he told the committee. ''Torture does not occur in the United States, except in abberational situations and never as a matter of government policy. When it does occur, it constitutes a serious criminal offense.''</p>
        <p>The American report acknowledges that there have been instances, ''and in some cases even patterns or practices of'' police abuse, brutality and unnecessary or excessive use of force, that included tear gas, pepper spray, stun guns, stun belts, police dogs, handcuffs and leg shackles.</p>
        <p>The report also listed racial bias and well as sexual abuse of prisoners by guards and other prisoners as problem areas, along with lack of police accountability, overcrowded prisons and confinement of children in substandard or abusive correctional facilities.</p>
        <p>Frank admissions of possible treaty violations before the United Nations committee are unusual, but this did not spare the American officials from extensive questioning. The committee's chairman, Peter Thomas Burns, a Canadian law professor, labeled the reported use of stun guns and belts by federal marshals ''quite alarming.'' This was particularly  true, he said, because they can be set off accidentally and administer a substantial voltage and serious pain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koh insisted that no legal cases had been brought to substantiate any charges of deaths or serious injuries to prisoners as a result of stun belt use. The belts are used only in transporting dangerous prisoners, he said. Misuse of stun guns by local police departments can be challenged in court, he added.</p>
