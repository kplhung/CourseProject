        <p>Officials investigating a malicious program that disrupted computer systems worldwide said today that they were looking for a computer student who recently wrote a thesis proposal for a program with similar elements.</p>
        <p>The student, who appears to have gone into hiding, is Onel de Guzman, 23, who lived in the same apartment in Manila as a man and a woman named on Monday as suspects in the case.</p>
        <p>When Mr. de Guzman presented his proposal in February, a thesis reviewer at his computer college rejected it, noting: ''This is illegal'' and ''We do not produce burglars.''</p>
        <p>The program released last week, a hybrid of varieties known as viruses and worms, ricocheted around the world as an attachment to e-mail messages with the subject line ''I Love You.'' Opening the attachment activated the program, which then sent itself along to addresses found in the victim's e-mail software. In addition, the program tried to fetch additional software from a Philippine Web site that could pilfer passwords from the user's computer.</p>
        <p>Officials at the college, AMA Computer College, said a second student, Michael Buen, had written software that might have been combined with Mr. de Guzman's work to create the malicious program. The officials said he, too, had gone into hiding.</p>
        <p>''The thesis proposal, though not illegal per se, could be used as part of the structure of the current virus,'' said Luis Pagulayan, the college's general counsel.</p>
        <p>He said subpoenas were being issued by the National Bureau of Investigation for both students, although investigators have not formally named them as suspects. The bureau is continuing to investigate the couple, Reomel Ramones and Irene de Guzman, whose apartment was raided on Monday. Ms. de Guzman is Mr. de Guzman's older sister.</p>
        <p>They initially became targets when investigators traced the virus to a computer in their apartment, but when it was raided on Monday the computer had been removed. Mr. Ramones was detained, but Ms. de Guzman disappeared after promising to turn herself in.</p>
        <p>Justice Secretary Artemio Tuquero said today that Mr. Ramones, who was held overnight Monday at the National Bureau of Investigation has had the case against him dropped.</p>
        <p>Manuel Abad, executive vice president of the college, said of Mr. de Guzman: ''We are not saying he is a suspect. If ever we found something about the thesis, it could only be a circumstantial lead. We do not know whether he did develop this as a virus.''</p>
        <p>He said it was his impression that if the two students were involved in the virus their intention was relatively modest: to steal and use passwords, not to spread destruction through computer systems worldwide.</p>
        <p>According to local news reports, both students were members of an underground campus group called GRAMMERSoft, which did programming work for hire and also wrote and sold thesis projects to other students. But college officials said they could not confirm that they were members.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abad said he had asked teachers what they recalled about Mr. de Guzman. ''He's the quiet type,'' he said. ''He's an average student although in some subjects he is getting very high grades. In our grading system, 1 is the highest and 5 is failing. In one subject, in Assembly Language'' -- a rudimentary programming language -- ''he got a 1. It's a pretty hard subject and he got a flat 1 on it. And on other computer subjects he got a 1.5, a 1.25.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Buen's and Mr. de Guzman's names surfaced over the weekend when computer security researchers in the United States and Sweden found that one component of the rogue program closely resembled password-stealing programs discovered in recent months by American anti-virus researchers.</p>
        <p>The earlier programs contained both a list of names and references to the Philippine computer college and the GRAMMERsoft group. Mr. Buen's name appeared in a brief resume, and Mr. de Guzman was on an extended list of names inserted in the program, perhaps as references.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pagulayan, the college's general counsel, said the two were among 10 possible suspects on a list given to Philippine investigators by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
        <p>He said the name of Mr. de Guzman immediately attracted notice at the school because, although many thesis proposals are rejected, his was turned down last term because ''it was contrary to law, dealing with hacking, dealing with a virus.''</p>
        <p>''That is not something that happens every day,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abad said Mr. Buen's thesis, which was accepted and which led to his graduation from the school last Friday, was able to create multiple copies of computer files.</p>
        <p>''If you merge both programs you can come up with this virus,'' said Karim Bangcola, senior vice president of the college.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Guzman's proposal, which was titled ''E-mail Password Sender Trojan,'' was never developed into a full-fledged thesis, and Mr. de Guzman did not graduate as scheduled last week.</p>
        <p>In the proposal, which was obtained by The Associated Press, he wrote that his software ''will be helpful to a lot of people, especially Internet users, to get Windows passwords such as Internet accounts to spend more time on the Internet without paying.''</p>
        <p>He also wrote: ''We spend a lot of money to pay for accounts for only using a couple of hours. So this program is the main solution. Use it to steal and retrieve Internet accounts of the victim's computer.''</p>
        <p>Explaining why the thesis proposal was rejected, Mr. Abad said: ''It carried a feature that could enable the software to steal passwords. And there's a recipient and it will steal the recipient's password and all the other names in the recipient's address book.</p>
        <p>''At the same time, all the names in that address book will be sent new e-mails automatically, and exponentially again you will get the e-mails and Internet accounts of these people,'' he said. ''We saw that to be very illegal and very immoral, and so we disapproved the thesis proposal. It never got developed within AMA.''</p>

        <p>Testimony on Virus</p>
        <p>By The New York Times</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON, March 10 -- A computer security expert told a Congressional panel today that the ''I Love You'' program had caused far more widespread damage than similar episodes in the past.</p>
        <p>The expert, Peter S. Tippett of ICSA.net in Reston, Va., said a preliminary survey by his company indicates 98 percent of businesses in North America received the email, and 65 percent had computers infected by the attached virus. In contrast, he said, a program known as Melissa that spread in similar fashion last year reached only 20 percent of the companies in North America and 10 percent were infected.</p>
        <p>Worldwide, Mr. Tippett estimated, the ''I Love You'' program caused $3 billion in damages and lost time. Lloyd's of London has estimated it will ultimately cost more than $15 billion.</p>
