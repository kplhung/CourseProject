        <p>ANIL'S GHOST  By Michael Ondaatje  311 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.</p>
        <p>In the Sri Lankan setting for Michael Ondaatje's delicately fragmented new novel, the figure known as the artificer assumes special importance. This is the artisan deemed worthy to paint eyes on a statue of the Buddha, a task that may be done only at 5 a.m. (the hour of the Buddha's enlightenment) with the help of a mirror, so as not to look straight into the deity's gaze.</p>
        <p>It is by this indirect means that ''the artificer brings to light sight and truth and presence,'' one of the book's many haunted characters observes. The author, in contemplating the dreadful toll that the civil war beginning in the mid-1980's has taken on his native land, aspires to the same role.</p>
        <p>As he did in ''The English Patient,'' Mr. Ondaatje is able to commingle anguish and seductiveness in fierce, unexpected ways. ''Then he turned on a slim hose and let it hover over each bone,'' he writes alluringly, ''air nestling into the evidence of the trauma as if he were blowing cool breath from a pursed mouth onto a child's burn.''</p>
        <p>That image, for all its sensual loveliness, happens to describe a forensic examination of the skeleton of a headless torture victim. Of the warfare among government, antigovernment insurgents and separatist guerrilla forces that provides the book's implicit backdrop, he writes: ''And we were caught in the middle. It was like being in a room with three suitors, all of whom had blood on their hands.''</p>
        <p>''Anil's Ghost,'' like the 33-year-old heroine of its title, steps into this catastrophe at a point when much of its damage has already been done. Born in Sri Lanka but having spent much of her life in England and America, Anil returns to her childhood home under the auspices of a Geneva-based human rights organization. A forensic anthropologist, she is part of a team investigating possible war crimes.</p>
        <p>''Anil had read documents and news reports, full of tragedy, and she had now lived abroad long enough to interpret Sri Lanka with a long-distance gaze,'' Mr. Ondaatje writes. ''But here it was a more complicated world morally. The streets were still streets, the citizens remained citizens. They shopped, changed jobs, laughed. Yet the darkest Greek tragedies were innocent compared with what was happening here.''</p>
        <p>Anil finds herself paired for the investigation with a government-selected archaeologist named Sarath, a remote man 16 years her senior. Together Anil and Sarath find four skeletons whom they nickname Tinker, Tailor, Soldier and Sailor, the last a source of obsessive fascination. Anil becomes convinced that pinpointing Sailor's identity and the circumstances of his death will provide the damning evidence she and Sarath are seeking. But only in this detective-story premise, and in the curiously theatrical gesture that ends the book, does ''Anil's Ghost'' adhere to any conventional storytelling patterns.</p>
        <p>Like ''The English Patient'' (despite the exquisite fluency of Anthony Minghella's screen adaptation) ''Anil's Ghost'' is a novel more in name than in essence. The author of 11 books of poetry, Mr. Ondaatje brings an oblique poetic sensibility to unraveling the mysteries at work here. Layers peel away from both Anil and Sarath, with a past full of ghosts for each of them and with assorted vignettes and memories scattered across the book's fertile landscape. The path through this terrain is not a clear or simple one.</p>
        <p>The book drifts in flashback, for instance, from Guatemala to the Miami bedroom where Anil has a tryst with her married lover, Cullis, who is as much on her mind as Sailor the skeleton. She speaks about the Spanish names for bones; he says he has written something about Norwegian snakes. While Cullis sleeps, in the kind of effortlessly bewitching gesture Mr. Ondaatje creates so gracefully, she photographs him, then buries the film inside his suitcase as a souvenir.</p>
        <p>But as to how such moments -- or those in which Anil writes a letter to John Boorman about his film ''Point Blank'' or ponders lyrics to a song set in New York State by the McGarrigle sisters -- connect with the book's essential business in Sri Lanka, that remains indistinct. Frustratingly so, since the scattered aspects of this voyage of discovery are separately so powerful.</p>
        <p>The book's real strengths lie in its profound sense of outrage, the shimmering intensity of its descriptive language and the mysterious beauty of its geography, with so many discrete passages that present the artificer in Mr. Ondaatje so well. The atlas itself, artfully used -- with places named Ambalangoda and Andigama, Ginigalpelessa and Boralesgamuwa -- enhances the sense of the gorgeously exotic throughout.</p>
        <p>''The important thing is to be able to live in a place or a situation where you must use your sixth sense all the time,'' says a surgeon in the story, describing what is most inviting about this morally outraged, viscerally vivid book. Like the elderly blind sage Palipana, Sarath's mentor, who has had the gift of reading between the lines of texts to glimpse hidden meanings, Mr. Ondaatje does not deal comfortably with the obvious. But his sixth sense -- his poet's sense -- is akin to that of Ananda, the book's character who is ultimately assigned the job of imagining Sailor's missing features. What Ananda recreates is not the literal physiognomy of Sailor. He conjures a different face, one that means much more.</p>
