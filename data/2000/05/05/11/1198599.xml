        <p>Zhou Weihui, dressed in a traditional black silk Chinese dress slit to midthigh, had gathered her friends and acquaintances on a veranda overlooking this city's famous 1930's-era waterfront, ostensibly to say goodbye to society for a while. She wanted to drop out of sight, she said, because she was under too much pressure from China's propaganda machine, which was busy trashing her best-selling novel, ''Shanghai Baby.''</p>
        <p>Already, Ms. Zhou's publisher had destroyed the page proofs and all of the books in stock, arguing -- after having sold at least 80,000 copies -- that the novel was in poor taste and that Ms. Zhou, 27, was too outlandish. Last week, Beijing city's Press and Publication Bureau raided a book fair in the capital and confiscated dozens of copies. And tens of thousands more are being destroyed around the country while the state media denounce Ms. Zhou as ''decadent, debauched and a slave of foreign culture.''</p>
        <p>''Shanghai Baby'' tells the story of Coco, a 25-year-old waitress who falls in love with a tall and handsome but impotent and drug-addicted man named Tian Tian. She moves in with him and later begins an affair with a married German. ''One is for love, the other is for lust,'' Ms. Zhou, explained on the Shanghai veranda, a cigarette fixed between her silver-nailed fingers.</p>
        <p>Tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of young Chinese have bought the book, making Weihui, as she prefers to be called, a national phenomenon. She is China's  most popular writer since Wang Shuo, whose late-1980's writings about Beijing's disaffected youth became so popular that the books are now available to read on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Few other contemporary Chinese writers come close. ''Shanghai Baby'' has gone through six printings since it was first published last September, and several pirated editions are circulating around the country. A newspaper in Guangzhou even serialized the book but published only half before it was forced to stop.</p>
        <p>''It's all right to hold some book signings and other promotional activities, but things should be done to a moderate and proper degree,'' said An Boshun, Ms. Zhou's editor at Chunfeng Literature and Art Publishing House, in a state-run newspaper last week. In other words, Weihui has become too popular -- a strange thing for a publisher to worry about.</p>
        <p>Mr. An, who has published a series of novels by China's ''new, new generation'' of writers, was slightly more forthcoming in a phone call. ''It's an ideological matter,'' he said, declining to discuss it further.</p>
        <p>Weihui's writing, and that of a handful of similar women of her generation, has set off a debate about what is literature in a country with a literary tradition stretching back thousands of years and where belles-lettres have often been considered politically suspect. Destroying books that challenge the state's worldview occurred as early as 213 B.C., when Emperor Qin Shi Huangdi burned all the books in the realm in an attempt to unify thought. China's current government has periodically resorted to similar, if less thorough, acts.</p>
        <p>Last month, a People's Daily editorial reminded readers that literature ''is a temple of holiness,'' and said that ''these pretty women writers, who have split from the solid foundation of Chinese creative writing and the rich historic and cultural background of Chinese literature, who know a smattering of Marguerite Duras and Henry Miller and dare jump onto the stage to do a striptease, will eventually feel ashamed of themselves.''</p>
        <p>The book touches on many social issues long taboo in Chinese literature, from female masturbation to homosexuality. It includes graphic, if sensitive, descriptions of sex. ''I strip to my bra and panties in the humid, night breeze from the Huangpu River. I hope this scene will stimulate Tian Tian. I continue, like a stripper. 'Have a try. Come to me, like a real lover, honey. Give it a try'.''</p>
        <p>Coco's impotent lover eventually dies of a heroin overdose and her German lover returns to his homeland, leaving her bereft in a city of vanity and desire.</p>
        <p>The book is one of the first in China to portray Weihui's generation of urban women, born in the 1970's, as they search for moral grounding in a country of shifting values. In many ways, her age group's dislocation from traditional culture is reminiscent of the generation gap that characterized the West in the 1960's -- an era that Weihui evokes with references in her book to Allen Ginsberg, Bob Dylan, the Beatles and others.</p>
        <p>Weihui sees herself as a feminist helping her generation of women understand themselves. ''This is the first book to tell young modern girls how to face sex,'' Weihui says. ''I just write the truth.''</p>
        <p>But the truth has always been difficult for China's cultural mandarins to handle. Nearly two decades ago, China banned the writings of another woman, Dai Houying, whose novel ''People, Oh People!'' was among the first books to explore people's emotions during the Cultural Revolution. Ms. Dai's writings, which are now back in print, were deemed too frank at the time.</p>
        <p>If indeed Weihui was going into seclusion, she was doing it with as much fanfare as she could muster. She fox-trotted on the veranda with a spiky-haired woman in a sleeveless blue top as a film crew and several photographers gyrated around her, recording the moment.</p>
        <p>The party felt staged -- the guests were an odd mix of ages and backgrounds, including the young man who applied her makeup. A tray of sliced French bread was drying out on a table next to a platter of coarse cakes covered with whipped nondairy cream. Waitresses in red skirts, white shirts and limp bow ties served tepid beer, Coke and red wine. The Lennon Sisters warbled from floor speakers, ''One day a little girl, the next day a lady,'' in an off-target attempt to create an atmosphere befitting Weihui's dress and the prewar bank buildings behind her.</p>
        <p>In fact, the film crew was working on a documentary that, combined with a dramatization of Weihui's works, will be sold on video disk together with her next book, ''Evil Pearl,'' a tragic story about a woman of Shanghai's demimonde. ''It's about how desire leads to destruction,'' Weihui said.</p>
        <p>Weihui is the daughter of an army officer and spent three years of her childhood living in an army-occupied temple from which the monks had been expelled during the chaotic Cultural Revolution. She studied literature at Shanghai's prestigious Fudan University and has written four previous books: ''The Shriek of the Butterfly,'' ''Virgin in the Water,'' ''Crazy Like Weihui'' and ''Desire Pistol.'' She hopes to publish ''Shanghai Baby'' in Taiwan, Japan and France.</p>
        <p>At the end of the evening, she headed home to her mother, clutching a red silk handbag and a small black cell phone that rang steadily at 15-minute intervals. Despite her bold stance, the mounting criticism was taking its toll, touching, perhaps, the filial emotions of a more tradition-bound woman deep inside.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes I don't know who is right,'' she said. ''Maybe I am wrong.''</p>
