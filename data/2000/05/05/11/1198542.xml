        <p>IT is rare in the world of high-technology gadgets to have the luxury of introducing a product without the concern of immediate competition.</p>
        <p>Netpliance Inc., the maker of the i-Opener -- a simple, inexpensive device that provides Internet and e-mail access without a personal computer -- finds itself in such a position, at least for a little while. So, to take advantage of a wide open marketplace, the company is introducing a marketing campaign before the battles begin for dominance.</p>
        <p>''We are just trying to maximize our first-mover advantage,'' said Bill Cobb, general manager for consumer sales at Netpliance, which is based in Austin, Tex. ''We're not going to worry about the competition right now. We're just focused on getting our message out there.''</p>
        <p>Getting the message out and explaining the product are the second phase of the company's marketing plan after introducing the device during the Super Bowl. A $13 million campaign, consisting primarily of print and direct mail, is the first work from BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, since that agency was named to handle the account in February.</p>
        <p>As Internet use continues to extend beyond the desktop to kitchen countertops, there are still plenty of people overwhelmed by the complexity of even turning on a computer. The i-Opener appliance and service, which is focused on computer novices 40 and older, is as easy to use as a microwave. Users can take it out of the box, plug it in, push a couple of buttons and surf the Web.</p>
        <p>But it is less simple to market a consumer-friendly Internet device to those who have technology phobia. One way, Netpliance and its agency decided, is to position it as a gift.</p>
        <p>One leg of the new campaign is centered on Mother's Day and Father's Day celebrations. Emotional holidays like those are a sensible time for marketers to start the communication to find customers because people are already in the market to buy gifts.</p>
        <p>The i-Opener now sells for $99 plus a $21.95 monthly fee to connect to its Internet service. The device, whose price is scheduled to rise to $199 after Father's Day, is primarily sold through the company's call centers or on its Web site, with retail distribution at stores like Circuit City.</p>
        <p>For the moment, the i-Opener has the advantage of being the trailblazer in the Internet appliance category in what some people are calling the post-PC era. But a host of competitors, including Compaq, Gateway and I.B.M., are preparing to offer Internet-only terminals by summer.</p>
        <p>''Right now, we have the marketplace to ourselves,'' said Lynne Seid, who heads the Netpliance account at BBDO New York as executive vice president and managing director. ''In fact, we are trying to create our own Christmas now.''</p>
        <p>New technology products are traditionally pitched heavily in the fourth quarter around Christmas, where there tends to be a plethora of ads from marketers eager to stimulate sales. Netpliance's goals for the second quarter are to explain the product simply, identify the best media for the target audience and gain subscribers.</p>
        <p>The i-Opener first came on the ad scene in January with what was meant to be a big splash during  Super Bowl XXXIV, but the commercial ended up getting lost in the blur of dot-com ads. Although that commercial was amusing and the message was clear, a month later Netpliance ended up shifting its account to BBDO New York from McGarrah/ Jessee, a small shop in Austin that created the Super Bowl ad.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cobb, who joined Netpliance in February, attributed that shift to his familiarity with BBDO New York from working with that agency in his previous posts at the Pepsi-Cola Company unit of PepsiCo and Tricon Global Restaurants.</p>
        <p>''McGarrah/Jessee is a fine branding agency, and they got us to a certain level, but the capability of BBDO as an ad agency and the additional agency services is so much wider,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cobb noted: ''Phase One of the campaign was really just trying to get in the game. Now we are in the educational phase.''</p>
        <p>From a visual standpoint, the new ads are staid and lack pizzazz, but BBDO hasn't lost its touch. It's all part of its plan to speak to its audience in a no-nonsense manner.</p>
        <p>''It's purposely not edgy like a lot of dot-com advertising you see,'' Ms. Seid said. ''The whole purpose was to look open, accessible and very plain-spoken and simple.''</p>
        <p>''We are not trying to be indirect or cute,'' she added with a chuckle. ''We are trying to be engaging. Obviously, we are in the advertising business.''</p>
        <p>Two ads with a Mother's Day theme feature a shot of the i-Opener accompanied by the phrase, ''Introducing i-Opener.'' One headline reads, ''If you want your mom to stop calling, buy her an i-Opener.'' A second ad's headline reads, ''Remind your mom why you're her favorite.''</p>
        <p>Two other general advertisements speaking directly to potential users will run between the two holidays. One headline reads, ''Meet i-Opener, your soon-to-be significant other.'' Another reads, ''Who says you can't get through to your kids.'' Each ad elaborates on the product, provides a toll-free order number and gives the address of the company's Web site, www.netpliance.com.</p>
        <p>Although the ads lack a tagline or some kind of catch phrase, the unifying factor, besides the stark look in general, is that they are ''selling an experience,'' Ms. Seid said.</p>
        <p>For the educational phase of the campaign, the company and agency decided to leave television out of the mix. That is unusual because BBDO is known for its lavish television campaigns.</p>
        <p>''It's a lot to ask a 30-second commercial to do,'' Ms. Seid said, ''in terms of educating a consumer, also having some stopping power and also registering the basic information so they can respond to the ad.''</p>
        <p>Print, in general, allows companies to focus on their audiences more precisely. Some of the publications in which i-Opener ads began running earlier this month include Entertainment Weekly, People, Time, TV Guide, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.</p>
        <p>Future marketing plans for the i-Opener were not disclosed. ''As we approach a more competitive environment and have lots of competitors spending a lot of money, we will be looking at what we will be doing next,'' Ms. Seid said.</p>
        <p>Being one of the first Net appliances doesn't come without pitfalls. An engineer recently posted on a Web site instructions for tweaking the i-Opener hardware so that it could work as a full-fledged PC. Since then, said Munira Fareed, the marketing director at Netpliance, the company closed the loophole that allowed people to make the changes.</p>
        <p>But the company can learn from the skills of the ''modifier.''</p>
        <p>''We think we can get some great R&amp;D from this,'' Mr. Cobb said.</p>
