        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas proposed a set of tax breaks today to encourage more people to buy long-term-care insurance and to ease the financial burden on people looking after ailing relatives at home.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Bush's plan, which anticipates the fast-growing number of older Americans, people of any age who buy insurance for the kind of extended nursing-home stays not covered by other policies or by Medicare could fully deduct the annual premium from their taxes, whether they itemize deductions or not.</p>
        <p>In addition, people with aging dependents at home could claim an extra exemption, which would amount to a nonitemized deduction of about $2,750.</p>
        <p>''To many of our seniors, illness can be a path to financial ruin, and this is one of the greatest fears of retirement and our nation must address it as we head into the 21st century,'' Mr. Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee, told about 80 people at a nursing home here.</p>
        <p>''This cost can undermine the whole idea of security in retirement,'' he said. ''It's time for many Americans to prepare -- prepare for peace-of-mind insurance. It must become a central part of retirement planning in America.''</p>
        <p>The scope and expense of Mr. Bush's proposal was modest -- it would cost $7.4 billion over five years -- and some critics said it would make only the smallest of dents in a problem that is becoming ever more severe. But the plan represents an effort to demonstrate that Mr. Bush is paying heed to health care and to elderly people, an issue and a voting bloc that could be decisive in the presidential election this fall.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush seemed to take the dynamics of the electorate into full account with remarks that aimed for a kind of political trifecta, singling out and offering reassurances not only to the elderly but also to baby boomers and to women. His message to baby boomers was that their anticipatory qualms about retirement were foremost in his mind, while his nod to women was his recognition that they typically shoulder most of the responsibility for older relatives.</p>
        <p>But the elderly were arguably his most important audience, because Vice President Al Gore has asserted that he has more thoughtful and responsible ideas for both health care and Social Security.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was clearly trying to challenge that claim. He intends to follow today's proposals with a speech on Monday outlining his philosophy on changing Social Security and Medicare and dealing with the high cost of prescription drugs.</p>
        <p>The high stakes of the presidential candidates' jostling over these issues was suggested by the fact the Gore campaign arranged for reporters to talk on the phone today with the secretary of health and human services, Donna E. Shalala.</p>
        <p>Dr. Shalala did not seem to be fully aware about what, exactly, Mr. Bush was recommending, but she said the plausibility of all of his proposals was thrown into doubt by his call for a tax cut of $483 billion over five years, which is much larger than the tax cut Mr. Gore favors.</p>
        <p>''There's no way, given the size of his tax cut, that he can pay for this,'' she said. ''It's an empty promise.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Shalala also said that Mr. Bush's financial incentives to buy long-term care insurance did nothing to address the flaws of many of the policies on the market and that the exemption that Mr. Bush would grant home caregivers was nowhere near as generous as the $3,000 tax credit that the Clinton administration had proposed and that Mr. Gore supports. The exemption, for someone in a 15 percent tax bracket would amount to only a few hundred dollars a year.</p>
        <p>Long-term care insurance, which fills a gap in what is provided by private and corporate health care policies and Medicare, covers the cost of an extended stay in a nursing home or assisted-living center for people whose financial resources have not dwindled to the point where they qualify for Medicaid. Figures provided by the Bush campaign indicated, only about 5 percent of Americans had such policies.</p>
        <p>An aide to Mr. Bush said that a 39-year-old person would pay an annual premium of about $358 for a policy that guaranteed two years of nursing home care, and $507 for a policy that guaranteed five years; a 64-year-old would pay about $1,265 for the two-year guarantee and $1,709 for the five-year one. The older the person buying the policy, the more it costs.</p>
        <p>More than 40 percent of Americans over the age of 65 have annual incomes of under $20,000. Joshua M. Wiener, a principal research associate at the Urban Institute in Washington, noted that these people would be unable to afford such a policy even after Mr. Bush's deduction, which would shave only a few hundred dollars off the price.</p>
        <p>''This is basically for the upper-middle-class elderly,'' Mr. Wiener said of Mr. Bush's proposal.</p>
        <p>The Bush plan also sets no income ceiling for eligibility, so that wealthy Americans in higher tax brackets would save more on the policies than middle-class Americans, because the tax deduction would be more valuable for them.</p>
        <p>But an aide to Mr. Bush said the plan was not intended primarily for these people, many of whom have jobs that already offer long-term care benefits and thus would not qualify for the deduction.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Bush, citing figures on the looming rise in the number of Americans over 65, said it was important to put mechanisms into place to encourage their financial security and to decrease the number who will end up needing public money and help.</p>
