        <p>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani began the day yesterday with a sensible attempt to clarify his personal and political future by saying that he and his wife, Donna Hanover, would separate. But his situation moved into a more strained and more public phase when Ms. Hanover responded with a statement saying that her efforts to share her husband's public life and save the marriage had been undermined by his turning to other relationships. In personal terms, it was a day of high emotion and personal anguish for Mr. Giuliani. In political terms, it was certainly the most complicated and perhaps the most critical moment of the New York mayor's career.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani spoke with commendable candor about his sadness over the state of his marriage, his determination ''to deal with it honestly and directly'' and his priorities in meeting an astonishing confluence of problems. In recent days he has received news that he has prostrate cancer, publicly acknowledged a close relationship with a single woman, confirmed long-rumored marital troubles and seen the future of his Senate candidacy thrown into uncertainty by his medical situation. Determining his political course is a ''second, maybe third, maybe fourth'' priority, he said. Indeed, the public will fully understand that choosing a treatment for his illness comes ahead of all other concerns.</p>

        <p>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani began the day yesterday with a sensible attempt to clarify his personal and political future by saying that he and his wife, Donna Hanover, would separate. But his situation moved into a more strained and more public phase when Ms. Hanover responded with a statement saying that her efforts to share her husband's public life and save the marriage had been undermined by his turning to other relationships. In personal terms, it was a day of high emotion and personal anguish for Mr. Giuliani. In political terms, it was certainly the most complicated and perhaps the most critical moment of the New York mayor's career.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani spoke with commendable candor about his sadness over the state of his marriage, his determination ''to deal with it honestly and directly'' and his priorities in meeting an astonishing confluence of problems. In recent days he has received news that he has prostrate cancer, publicly acknowledged a close relationship with a single woman, confirmed long-rumored marital troubles and seen the future of his Senate candidacy thrown into uncertainty by his medical situation. Determining his political course is a ''second, maybe third, maybe fourth'' priority, he said. Indeed, the public will fully understand that choosing a treatment for his illness comes ahead of all other concerns.</p>
        <p>But other issues will continue to press in upon the mayor. Even before yesterday's events, in what was widely read as a signal from the state Republican hierarchy, the majority leader of the State Senate, Joseph Bruno, called on Mr. Giuliani to bring order to his domestic situation. The subtext of the statement was that G.O.P. leaders are worried that publicity about Mr. Giuliani's personal life could cripple or even end his candidacy and allow Hillary Rodham Clinton to win the Senate campaign. Mr. Giuliani himself acknowledged that some people will be ''very angry, very upset'' with him, adding a new element of uncertainty to an already turbulent campaign.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hanover's statement had a subtext too, with its hints of a bitter divorce and custody battle and potentially embarrassing revelations. Her reference to Mr. Giuliani's ''relationship with one staff member'' seemed a threat against the mayor's insistence that he has maintained a wall between his personal and public lives.</p>
        <p>Even in a state that allows its politicians plenty of room, this combination of medical, personal and political difficulty is formidable. Mr. Giuliani has prided himself on being a mold-breaking politician with an extraordinary capacity for work. But there is a limit to the amount of political baggage that any candidate can overcome. Common sense dictates that Mr. Bruno's advice about the campaign is apt. Mr. Giuliani must move as quickly as his health allows to restore a sense of order to his personal life and to inform voters about his political future.</p>
        <p>His appeal for some confidential space in which to work out his medical and marital decisions is reasonable. But with the statements from Mr. Giuliani and his wife yesterday, the issues surrounding him have become part of the civic discourse. As the manager of a complicated city and a declared aspirant for national leadership, Mayor Giuliani has an obligation to bring clarity and stability to a disorderly situation.</p>
