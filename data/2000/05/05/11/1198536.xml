        <p>''IT'S just as splendid as Sotheby's or Christie's,'' said Dan Klein, the international executive director of Phillips auction house, exuding an air of proprietary triumph last week as he toured the American Craft Museum at 40 West 53rd Street. Only 10 days earlier, the galleries were earthy shades of orange, yellow and green. But the designer Bill Katz has transformed the museum into a gleaming white showcase for artworks from Phillips's spring sales, creating walls for intimate viewing and banishing the cluttered gift shop.</p>
        <p>Passing multimillion-dollar canvases, Mr. Klein stopped to pose before an Andy Warhol silkscreen that seemed prophetic: a giant dollar sign.</p>
        <p>Long a distant third in the world auction stakes, Phillips has rented the museum for three weeks, and lavished $1.3 million in construction costs, sources said -- not counting design fees -- as part of an ambitious attempt to give the company's fusty reputation a swift, elegant facelift. Tonight, in a setting newly glamorous with helium-filled lanterns and Sharon Stone (supplying the celebrity quotient), Mr. Klein will conduct the biggest sale in Phillips's 206-year history, an auction of 31 Impressionist and modern works that may bring $80 million -- quite a leap from its total record sale of $3.6 million in 1998.</p>
        <p>Coming at a time when the world's two leading auction houses, Sotheby's and Christie's, are embroiled in an embarrassing price-fixing scandal, Phillips, which is based in London, is causing a considerable stir with its conspicuous and costly effort to reinvent itself as an important player in New York. Richard Feigen, a prominent New York art dealer, said: ''I think it's fine to have a third force in the auction world. I just don't see how they're going to do it.''</p>
        <p>One way is to create a couture image, which Phillips has done by luring the art world's equivalent of beautiful models -- from Cezanne, Renoir and Picasso to Damien Hirst; by making substantial guarantees to sellers; and by buying at least 8 of 31 works outright for resale, which is raising eyebrows. ''Spending so much money, I can't see how they'd recoup it,'' Mr. Feigen said. ''Not even if they had an impressive permanent space.''</p>
        <p>Cramped and rundown, Phillips's existing New York headquarters at 406 East 79th Street has a single salesroom-cum-gallery that resembles the auditorium of a cruelly underfinanced high school.</p>
        <p>''I think you can see why we had to get out of here to have an Impressionist sale,'' Mr. Klein said, as he led this reporter on a swift tour.</p>
        <p>The American Craft Museum's location gives Phillips a sophisticated new image -- at least until the auction house leaves on May 19. ''It's smart what they did, to rent this space and show these paintings,'' said Laszlo von Vertes, a collector and former art dealer visiting from Zurich, who was among the first to stop by last Friday for a look at Phillips's wares before heading four blocks south to do the same at Christie's. ''It's big competition for Sotheby's and Christie's, which is good for the market.''</p>
        <p>Expectations for Phillips's chance for success are fueled by the formidable resources of the man bankrolling it: Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, a $40 billion behemoth. He bought Phillips last November for a bargain price of $121.5 million and hopes to seize a chunk of Sotheby's and Christie's turf. Together, Sotheby's and Christie's control most of the $5 billion global fine art auction business. Igniting Mr. Arnault's efforts is his noted rivalry with Francois Pinault, a French department store magnate who triumphed over Mr. Arnault last year for control of Gucci and who bought Christie's in 1998 for a much heftier $1.2 billion.</p>
        <p>Alexander Apsis, a partner in the gallery C&amp;M Arts on East 78th Street and the former head of the Impressionist and modern art department at Sotheby's, believes it is possible for Phillips to claim some of Christie's and Sotheby's business. ''This is the perfect time, because the market is in a state of flux,'' he said. ''And a lot of new collectors are entering the market.''</p>
        <p>''Six months ago, I don't think anyone would have predicted that Phillips would be this far along,'' he went on. ''They've made big strides.''</p>
        <p>But such strides come at a price; many in the art world commented on Phillips's recent tactics of promising the seller a large fixed sum, no matter what the outcome at auction, just to get the firepower to make the five coming sales seem impressive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arnault, in town for the auctions, said, referring to his rivals, ''We made some guarantees, as everyone did. It's a normal game. I understand they're not happy to have lost these paintings, that's all.''</p>
        <p>As to the cost of fixing up the  museum, ''the premises needed it,'' he said. ''And I think it's beautiful. Bill Katz did a wonderful job. You know, we're used to this. It's what we do when we have a fashion show in the group. We think it's important to show the public the products we're going to sell in a nice way.''</p>
        <p>If the strategy works, noted Joe Helman, a well-known 57th Street dealer, ''it's an inexpensive way to buy into the art market.'' Spiffing up a museum and guaranteeing paintings is ''a lot cheaper,'' he said, than buying Christie's or Sotheby's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arnault tried that, too, last December, when he entered negotiations with Alfred A. Taubman, Sotheby's former chairman and still the controlling stockholder. But talks fell through, a former Sotheby's executive close to Mr. Taubman said.</p>
        <p>The new Phillips venture, Mr. Klein admitted, ''is a leap of faith by Mr. Arnault, and we've jumped off the cliff with him.''</p>
        <p>By a peculiar twist of fate, the star item in this evening's sale is Kasimir Malevich's ''Suprematist Composition,'' a rare abstract geometric painting in black, red and white that until last year had hung for 63 years at the Museum of Modern Art across the street. Important Suprematist oil paintings by Malevich have been virtually absent from the auction market since his death in 1935.</p>
        <p>But even with Phillips's prize pony being offered up tonight as the final lot of the evening, some observers sounded a note of concern. ''There are very few buyers out there for a Malevich,'' Mr. Feigen observed, though Mr. Apsis noted that this particular painting ''is exceptional.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Katz emphasized the painting's importance by allotting it a wall of its own that was immediately visible as visitors entered from the lobby. To alert passers-by, an enormous blown-up photograph of the painting was placed in the museum's 53rd Street window, to the chagrin of the Museum of Modern Art, which gave the painting back to Malevich's 31 descendants last year in an amicable settlement.</p>
        <p>Phillips is reported to have guaranteed $15 million to the heirs, after a five-day negotiation.</p>
        <p>Lawrence M. Kaye, a lawyer for the heirs, said, ''The family was very impressed by the enthusiasm that Phillips showed.''</p>
        <p>In an unusual move, Phillips has declined to set an official estimate on the painting, but art experts think it could fetch at least $10 million, making it the most valuable work ever offered by the auctioneer. (A Monet seascape, the previous record, sold in 1998 for $2.5 million.)</p>
        <p>Declining to discuss the heft of Phillips's guarantees and other financial arrangements with consignors, Mr. Klein was more than eager to show off the American Craft Museum, in its current, spiffed-up condition. Just off the entrance, where giant canvases by Andy Warhol and David Salle now hang in isolated splendor, the lobby was formerly filled with a warren of counters and  merchandise as part of the museum's gift shop.</p>
        <p>''Spatially, the museum is very beautiful, but like everyone's life, it gets cluttered up after a while,'' said Mr. Katz, who is known for the spare refinement of his work and for his well-cultivated friendships with artists, including Jasper Johns, Cy Twombly and Ellsworth Kelly, for whom he has designed exhibitions. ''My goal always is to simplify and clarify,'' Mr. Katz said. ''The idea is to draw attention to the art.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Katz was hired by Phillips in February, shortly after returning from the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, where he installed Francesco Clemente's current exhibition. ''It was all very quick,'' he said. Lamps previously suspended at just-above-hairdo level in the lobby were removed. And Mr. Katz designed simple, interconnected white walls to create intimately scaled spaces for viewing. He also lowered each entryway and painted the recessed spaces dark gray. ''This way, your eye is not distracted from the experience of viewing the paintings,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Plans called for installing 480 artworks for the separate shows, each of which required new walls to be put in place overnight. Five snappy catalogs, designed by Richard Pandiscio, celebrate the new level of work Phillips is representing. Abigail Asher, a partner at Guggenheim &amp; Asher, art consultants, noted, ''They've certainly put together catalogs unlike any other Phillips catalogs we've ever seen before.''</p>
        <p>In another attempt to upgrade Phillips's image, Mr. Klein has been searching for a new Manhattan headquarters. Until he finds something, Mr. Klein said that Phillips may continue to hold auctions twice a year at the American Craft Museum. ''It's all been very wild and exciting,'' Mr. Klein said. ''Now we just have to sell the pictures.''</p>
        <p>Tonight's auction will begin to tell the tale. Tobias Meyer, head of contemporary art for Sotheby's worldwide, threw down the gauntlet. ''The question is,'' he said, ''how much is Mr. Arnault prepared to lose?''</p>
