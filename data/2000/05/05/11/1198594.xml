        <p>The National Institutes of Health is set to begin its first full-scale tests of a vaccine for people already infected with the AIDS virus, the vaccine's manufacturer said yesterday.</p>
        <p>In the tests, injections of the vaccine, Remune, will be added to standard combination drug therapy for H.I.V., the AIDS virus. Such drugs can halt reproduction of H.I.V. in infected cells but do not eradicate the virus from those who are infected. Remune is intended to be a therapeutic vaccine, to stimulate the immune system to destroy H.I.V.-infected cells.</p>
        <p>The study seeks to determine whether Remune will keep the levels of H.I.V. in the blood suppressed longer than anti-H.I.V. drug therapy alone and thwart progression of infection to full-blown AIDS.</p>
        <p>Vaccines are routinely given to prevent polio and many other infections. If the tests are successful, Remune would be the first therapeutic vaccine for any disease to work in those already infected. But the vaccine is not expected to cure AIDS.</p>
        <p>The only full-scale testing of an experimental preventive H.I.V. vaccine is being conducted in Thailand and the United States.</p>
        <p>Experts said the odds were long for Remune's becoming a successful therapeutic vaccine.</p>
        <p>Other therapeutic H.I.V. vaccines have been tested and found to be ineffective. Before combination anti-H.I.V. therapy was introduced, the United States military conducted a large full-scale test of another therapeutic vaccine. Prolonged administration of the vaccine was safe but did not benefit infected volunteers.</p>
        <p>Remune's manufacturer, the Immune Response Corporation of Carlsbad, Calif., stopped a full-scale trial involving more than 2,500 infected volunteers last year because a monitoring committee deemed it unlikely to provide statistically significant findings to meet its primary objective, which was to measure disease progression to an AIDS-related condition, or death.</p>
        <p>At the time the study began, those were the only goals the Food and Drug Administration used for licensing an H.I.V. vaccine. Since then, the federal drug agency has revised its guidelines to allow levels of H.I.V. in the blood to be used for considering approval of H.I.V. drugs and vaccines. The new Remune study has been designed differently to account for the drug agency changes.</p>
        <p>Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said his federal agency was undertaking the new full-scale tests because it was important to test the concept that a vaccine could increase the benefit of anti-H.I.V. drugs in infected people.</p>
        <p>If the combination works, Dr. Fauci said, it could be particularly important for people in whom combination drug therapy fails and could provide clues to which immune response is specifically associated with prolongation of viral suppression. Such a finding might also help in designing preventive H.I.V. vaccines.</p>
        <p>The new Remune study is expected to involve 472 volunteers at 40 centers in this country, begin in a few weeks, and last 96 weeks.</p>
        <p>Dr. Fred T. Valentine, an AIDS expert at New York University who is not connected with Remune's manufacturer, is the principal investigator of the new study. Dr. Valentine said he had been encouraged to design the study because his earlier studies had shown preliminary evidence that the vaccine was safe and could boost parts of the immune system in those infected with H.I.V.  He said the study intended to answer two crucial questions: will the vaccine control viral replication, and, if so, will it benefit infected people?</p>
