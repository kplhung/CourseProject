        <p>For years, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange was nearly as notorious among international financiers as the country itself was among human rights advocates.</p>
        <p>Isolated from the world, apartheid-era South Africa learned to play by its own rules, its financial markets evolving into an insular, incestuous morass where insider trading was a key part of the game.</p>
        <p>Now, a decade after the country began a political transformation, South Africa's market has found that it, too, must change. Backed by a new law, regulators have taken aim at insider traders.</p>
        <p>In the first year under the new law, the market has won six settlements totaling almost 2.2 million rand ($320,000), and more important, it says, it has sounded a new opening bell in the financial capital of Africa.</p>
        <p>''We want people to be scared,'' said Peter Redman, a former broker and stock exchange chairman who is now a senior surveillance official for the exchange, ''so that they just don't do this sort of thing.''</p>
        <p>The regulators are, by their own admission, a long way from that point, but they are pressing ahead, knowing that much is at stake. Indeed, for South Africa's financial sector and the stock exchange in particular, few matters are more pressing. The country is slowly rebuilding its economy, and it craves the foreign investment a thriving stock exchange could bring. Emerging markets like South Africa, Brazil and South Korea are hot, and as a barrier to investment, national borders are fast becoming obsolete.</p>
        <p>What remains an obstacle here and in many other emerging markets, though, is the fear of being bamboozled. Foreign investors want to know that they are trading on a level playing field, that they have access to the same company information that local investors do.</p>
        <p>It is a concern that South Africa's chief insider trading enforcer, Rob Barrow, has heard all too often from people with money to invest.</p>
        <p>''Some of them have made it very clear to me that they resist coming into the South African market, sometimes with substantial money, or money that would be substantial to us and our economy because they've been here before and believe they've been taken to the cleaners,'' said Mr. Barrow, chairman of the country's newly formed Insider Trading Directorate. ''That, of course, is the perception we are trying to change.''</p>
        <p>The Johannesburg Stock Exchange's trading volume increased nearly ninefold, from 5.2 billion shares at the end of 1995, to 43.1 billion at the end of 1999.</p>
        <p>Insider trading -- trading on nonpublic information that could affect a stock's price -- was never much of a secret here. And for decades, under the Companies Act, it was a criminal offense. But it was impossible to prosecute. The charges were hard to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, and prosecutors were frequently ill equipped to handle such complicated cases. So the accusations hardly ever saw the inside of a courtroom. Not once, in fact, did South Africa ever win an insider trading conviction under the old law.</p>
        <p>Under the Insider Trading Act enacted last year, however, insider trading not only became a criminal offense but a civil one, too. In a civil proceeding, the standard of proof is not as high, and that has opened a new door for the authorities here.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the authorities say, they hope to send someone to prison for insider trading. But after years of seeing no results, at least they have, in the civil settlements won so far, something to show for their work. In the largest settlement, won late last year, Ron Sackstein, chief executive of I-Fusion Holdings, a local information technology company, paid just over a million rand, or about $160,000, to settle insider trading accusations against him.</p>
        <p>While most agree that the civil actions are a measure of progress, sentiment is split on whether settlements are enough to discourage dishonest traders. In some cases, the terms have allowed those accused to remain unidentified.</p>
        <p>''It shouldn't really just be a civil action,'' said Ian McMillan, chief investment officer for Fleming Asset Management in Cape Town. ''It should be more serious. If your penalty is just a monetary one, the incentive is there to try it because maybe you can make more than they'll take.''</p>
        <p>John Pott, the southern Africa representative for the International Finance Corporation, a unit of the World Bank, said he, too, would like to see an even more aggressive approach by regulators.</p>
        <p>''I think the question in investors' minds still is are the deterrents of a sufficient magnitude,'' said Mr. Pott, who said his agency had about $100 million in investments here. ''I guess that is our concern, and we would hope that they would go one step further toward how the S.E.C. deals with the problem.''</p>
        <p>But South Africa, swamped by every sort of crime and struggling to remake its apartheid-era system of law enforcement, has nothing like the American Securities and Exchange Commission's army of investigators and prosecutors with the skills and resources to turn complicated, painstaking investigations into coherent, viable prosecutions.</p>
        <p>So as South Africans see it, they are doing the next best thing, said Nicky Newton-King, the stock exchange's legal counsel.</p>
        <p>''Around the world, what is happening with white-collar crime is people are moving to civil remedies because very few courts and prosecutors have the technical skills to actually get behind this sort of contravention,'' she said. ''If what you can do is take the profit out of the crime for the guys that are doing it and you can stop and make them think, then I think you've been successful.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, even giving potential insider traders pause is seen as a step forward in South Africa, where history helped instill insider trading into the ethos of a business establishment dominated by the white minority. Dodging trade sanctions demanded a certain creativity. Forged certificates of origin for products made here were commonplace, and in one form or another, that sort of scheming took hold in quite a few corners of the business sector. There was ''a culture of insider trading,'' Mr. Redman said.</p>
        <p>And the structure of corporate ownership and management that evolved, mostly out of necessity, during the era of sanctions only encouraged the sort of misbehavior the country is now trying to stamp out. With little foreign investment and ownership, the biggest South African businesses became nests of complex cross holdings.</p>
        <p>''There was a concentration of power,'' said Bill Urmson, the stock exchange's director of surveillance. ''And an awful lot of information was flowing into those very few citadels of power, which made the opportunity for insider trading more severe.''</p>
        <p>Now, securities regulators and market administrators are trying to teach companies how to conduct themselves in this new, open environment. Guidelines about who disseminates information, who gets information and when are more common.</p>
        <p>It is a work in progress, to be sure. In March, in the latest move toward a more transparent corporate culture, the stock exchange announced plans to require directors to disclose dealings in their companies' shares promptly. Such requirements are standard in the world's biggest markets, and adopting them here would be another step toward bringing the stock exchange in line with its more  reputable counterparts in New York, London and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>The changes are not only in South Africa. International investors, enchanted by the promise of emerging markets, have pressed for change from South America to Southeast Asia.</p>
        <p>''Globalization of markets demands globalization of regulation,'' said Miroslaw Kachniewski, a Polish securities regulator who heads an international committee examining enforcement in emerging markets.</p>
        <p>The committee, part of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, is scheduled to present a report at that organization's annual meeting, which starts this weekend in Sydney.</p>
        <p>Putting all the world's securities regulators on the same page, as far as what constitutes insider trading and what the appropriate response is, is the ultimate objective of Mr. Kachniewski and his committee.</p>
        <p>''The vast majority of regulators are aware,'' he said in a phone interview from Warsaw. ''However, there are some jurisdictions where insider trading is not a criminal offense, and I hope our research will help give regulators the information they need to convince their governments that changes are necessary.''</p>
        <p>Certainly, South Africa is not that far behind compared with efforts in developing nations. ''I think among emerging markets, and certainly in Africa, they are ahead of the pack,'' Mr. Pott said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Barrow, the insider-trading enforcer, knows he will be judged, not on his success in winning legal battles but on the market's success in winning over wary investors. ''You can only judge the success on the perception of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, that the J.S.E. is a market with sufficient integrity that anyone can trade on it,'' he said. ''I think we are well on our way to getting there.''</p>
