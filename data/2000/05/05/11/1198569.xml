        <p>Editorial says Million Mom March planned for Washington and some 60 other cities nationwide on Mother's Day has potential to achieve something that seemingly endless sequence of school shootings and other gun tragedies has not, namely, of seizing control of America's gun control debate from National Rifle Association and its political mouthpieces</p>

        <p>The Million Mom March taking place this Sunday in Washington and some 60 other cities across the nation has the potential to achieve something that a seemingly endless sequence of school shootings and other gun tragedies somehow has not. That critical something is to seize control of America's gun control debate from the National Rifle Association and its political mouthpieces. The spectacle of huge numbers of mothers organizing to protect their children is something even the N.R.A. will find hard to attack.</p>
        <p>By demonstrating that there is a large, identifiable grass-roots constituency that supports sensible steps like full background checks before all gun sales and a new national system of gun licensing and registration, Sunday's event could help transform the gun control argument -- tilting it away from an archaic fixation on the rights of hunters and toward a recognition of the serious public health threat the nation's porous gun laws represent. For those frustrated by the failure of the political system to deliver meaningful gun control legislation, it is hard to think of a better way to spend Mother's Day.</p>

        <p>The Million Mom March taking place this Sunday in Washington and some 60 other cities across the nation has the potential to achieve something that a seemingly endless sequence of school shootings and other gun tragedies somehow has not. That critical something is to seize control of America's gun control debate from the National Rifle Association and its political mouthpieces. The spectacle of huge numbers of mothers organizing to protect their children is something even the N.R.A. will find hard to attack.</p>
        <p>By demonstrating that there is a large, identifiable grass-roots constituency that supports sensible steps like full background checks before all gun sales and a new national system of gun licensing and registration, Sunday's event could help transform the gun control argument -- tilting it away from an archaic fixation on the rights of hunters and toward a recognition of the serious public health threat the nation's porous gun laws represent. For those frustrated by the failure of the political system to deliver meaningful gun control legislation, it is hard to think of a better way to spend Mother's Day.</p>
        <p>The march comes at a critical moment. The nation is in the midst of a presidential election year in which gun control will surely be an issue. On Capitol Hill, a worthwhile if modest package of gun control measures remains bottled up in a House-Senate conference committee -- providing grist for this fall's battle between the Democrats and Republicans for control of Congress. Gun makers, facing lawsuits brought by localities harmed by the irresponsible design, marketing and distribution of their products, are under pressure to join Smith &amp; Wesson in agreeing to change the way they do business -- a move they are still strongly resisting. Meanwhile more than 80 Americans, including about a dozen children, continue to die every day from gun violence.</p>
        <p>The march will focus on child safety and will involve hundreds of thousands of mothers who also happen to be swing voters. It is therefore certain to get politicians' attention. But whether it will succeed in breaking through the ideological and partisan barriers that stand in the way of gun control remains to be seen. Obviously a lot depends on  maintaining the event's nonpartisan tenor and, afterward, its momentum. The women and men who participate cannot abandon the battle after the day's protest is over.</p>
        <p>The idea for the march originated with Donna Dees-Thomases, a New Jersey mother who says she was energized by the televised images of terrified children being led from their day camp to escape a gunman's shooting rampage in Granada Hills, Calif., last August. The tactic of invoking the moral authority of mothers to gain progress on a pressing social issue is not new. It worked remarkably well for Mothers Against Drunk Driving, for example, which played a big role in shifting attitudes on drinking and driving. We suspect, and strongly hope, that mom power can work similar magic for the gun control movement.</p>
