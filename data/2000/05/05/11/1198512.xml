        <p>Trisha Brown's new jazz-inspired dance piece is a beauty, a perfect blend of the vernacular and the abstract. The work, ''Rapture to Leon James,'' received its New York premiere on Tuesday night when the Trisha Brown Dance Company opened its second and final week at the Joyce Theater.</p>
        <p>''Canto/Pianto,'' a revised suite of dances from Ms. Brown's staging of the Monteverdi opera ''Orfeo,'' was also seen on a program that included ''Locus,'' a solo, and ''For M. G.: The Movie,'' an oddly private tribute by Ms. Brown to Michel Guy, who died in 1990; he admired her work before and after he was France's culture minister. The last two pieces exhibit a Brown trademark: too many ideas behind each dance that the choreographer does not share with the audience. A program note can provide a clue, but more often than not the deliberately illogical can look merely arbitrary. ''For M. G'' is hard going, but in ''Locus'' Ms. Brown seduces the viewer with the quality of her performance.</p>
        <p>In this solo in silence, the movement (a long phrase including a little twist of the torso, a hand lifting a foot, a forward bend from the waist toward invisible corners) is less important than its contrast between the fluid and the angular. One doesn't really have to know that Ms. Brown once saw herself inside an imaginary cube and that the locus of the title refers to more than one specific point within that cube.</p>
        <p>Certainly one doesn't have to worry about concepts in ''Rapture to Leon James,'' in which Ms. Brown was inspired by a film featuring James, who was a star of the Lindy Hoppers at the Savoy Hotel in Harlem and who died in 1970. It is not that ideas, especially about structure or distillation of social dances, are absent. It is that the theatricality of a polished image takes over, making the choreography accessible on several planes.</p>
        <p>The piece becomes an ode to jazz as music, dance and social activity. The fine score by Dave Douglas complements the choreography, too contemporary to turn to a literal interpretation of swing music. Terry Winters's wonderful set, a tower of golden disks, recalls cymbals or records. The dancing refers to jitterbugging, the Charleston and lines in which Lindy Hoppers would follow a leader. Yet like the score and the decor, the dancing evokes the real thing without depicting it.</p>
        <p>Especially startling and effective is the way Ms. Brown adapts her usual high-flying system of partnering to an image of swing dancing. Kathleen Fisher and Keith Thompson's duet may recall jitterbuggers' tosses and throws. Yet all the shapes are geometric (a woman wrapped around a man's body with legs held out in V formation). Mondrian's ''Broadway Boogie Woogie'' comes to mind.</p>
        <p>Jennifer Tipton has outdone herself with the lighting, changing the backdrop's colors. Jazz is hot or cool, and Ms. Tipton's palette from fuchsia to turquoise creates the aura of shifting energy that brings into relief the gray-white-black tones of the costumes. The whole work gleams.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brown's brilliant conceit is that it takes two to jitterbug, and the choreography is built upon pairs of dancers who rarely touch. Two women, Brandi Norton and Ms. Fisher, set the pace, swiveling torsos, swinging arms and extending legs. They dance in unison but are apart, down to every waddle and pelvic thrust impelled by the percussion.</p>
        <p>The melody on the brass instruments expands the dance. Mr. Thompson and Stacy Matthew Spence shadowbox wittily across the stage, and Mr. Thompson is superb when he leads a group: the image is of improvisation, real or simulated. ''Rapture'' is about a community, but the dancers, including Mariah Maloney, Seth Parker, Todd Stone, Katrina Thompson and Abigail Yager, stand out as spirited individuals. ''Rapture'' has legs.</p>
        <p>The music and choreography were commissioned by the American Dance Festival and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts through their Doris Duke Awards for Dance and Jazz Music Collaborations. The music was played live by Mr. Douglas, on trumpet, and his musicians: Greg Tardy, tenor saxophonist; Greg Cohen, bassist; and Susie Ibarra, percussionist.</p>
        <p>As for ''Canto/Pianto,'' its four sections (''The Wedding,'' ''The Message,'' ''Journey to the Underworld,'' ''The Death of Orfeo'') offer a compressed version of the dramatic action that Ms. Brown directed in Monteverdi's opera. The full production was seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music last year, but this is the first time the suite of dances from the opera has been performed in New York.</p>
        <p>Although the choreography is not literal, what looks like pure movement is often combined with heightened gesture. At times a dancer substituting for a singer mouths the words heard on a recording. The group sections focus on jumbles of dancers who reel off lines in cumulative patterns. But even more effective is the use of frozen tension, as in the underworld, symbolized by four men in slow motion. They line up, forming a wall with Ms. Fisher, standing in beautiful stillness to one side.</p>
