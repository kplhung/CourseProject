        <p>Four former officials and a former staff member for District Council 37, the largest union of city employees, were indicted yesterday on charges of misusing union funds, prosecutors announced.</p>
        <p>Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, said Eugene Bruno, the union's chief lobbyist, Lionel Scott and Mary Wilson, who were both union vice presidents, were indicted on charges of stealing $60,000 from the union by filing expense reports and cashing airline tickets for trips they never took.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scott and Albert A. Diop, also a vice president, were indicted on charges of having the union pay for a $16,810 cruise to Alaska. Mr. Diop took his nephew on the trip, investigators said, and Mr. Scott took his step-grandson.</p>
        <p>Of those four, all but Mr. Bruno have been indicted before in the continuing corruption investigation of the union with 125,000 members, which so far has resulted in 21 guilty pleas.</p>
        <p>Dan Castleman, the chief of investigation in Mr. Morgenthau's office, said Ms. Wilson failed to attend a scheduled court appearance yesterday and would be considered a fugitive. An investigator who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Ms. Wilson was believed to be in Aruba.</p>
        <p>Joseph Alfano, a former staff employee of Local 372, which represents crossing guards and cafeteria workers, was indicted on charges of bribing another union official, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>A sixth suspect, Florence Pescatore, of Holmes, N.Y., the owner of a travel company that prosecutors said aided various union officials in the travel schemes, was also indicted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diop, who is scheduled to go on trial on June 12 on corruption and vote-rigging charges, was released yesterday. Bail for Mr. Bruno was set at $10,000 and for Ms. Pescatore at $30,000. Both were in custody as of early yesterday afternoon.</p>
