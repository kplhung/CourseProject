        <p>The precious glove Yogi Berra used during Don Larsen's perfect game 44 years ago was analyzed from outside a glass case at Berra's museum in Little Falls, N.J., two days ago so it could serve as the model for glove cloning. The brown glove, which was bronzed after Larsen made World Series history, has been left alone for almost half a century.</p>
        <p>But that changed this week because of Jorge Posada. Berra told Posada how comfortable the glove was because it had a fishnet-type webbing that enabled him to hold on to more foul tips. Yogi watched Posada's eyes widen when he described the ancient piece of leather, so Berra asked Posada, ''Do you want one?''</p>
        <p>The old Yankee catcher told the new Yankee catcher that he knows someone called the Glove Doctor. Maybe, Yogi said to Posada, the doctor could alter one of Posada's gloves and stitch in this kind of fishnet webbing, too. Posada handed Berra one of his gloves last Sunday and is waiting for John Golomb, the doctor, to transform it into a clone of Yogi's perfect mitt by next week.</p>
        <p>''He told me I'm going to love it,'' Posada said. ''He said it's great.''</p>
        <p>This glove story is an example of how Posada's world is rapidly changing every day, even every hour. The byplay between Berra and Posada would probably not have occurred last year because Posada was not as relaxed as he is now as a full-time catcher who keeps blossoming.</p>
        <p>The Yankees had numerous questions coming into this season. There was the advanced age of David Cone and Roger Clemens, there was the left field dilemma, there was the need for a designated hitter and there was Posada's working without a safety net. Of these, the question involving Posada was the most pressing. And Posada, with a robust .376 average and eight homers, has given the most resounding answer that he should not be questioned anymore.</p>
        <p>''I'm having a lot of fun,'' Posada said. ''I didn't have fun at all last year. Getting to play helps a lot. Obviously, I'm doing well. I can't wait to get to the park and keep doing it.''</p>
        <p>Berra, a polite yet shy legend, guessed that he had said hello to Posada twice before spring training. Yogi knew Posada, but he did not really know him. George Steinbrenner pleaded with Berra to come to Tampa, Fla., this spring and ''look at our catchers.'' So Berra sauntered up to Posada and said, ''I was terrible in my first two years,'' making Posada laugh and feel comfortable.</p>
        <p>All Posada wanted from Berra were the stories. Berra told Posada how Bill Dickey was so intent on improving Berra's throwing that he asked other teams to try and steal against the Yankees in spring training. Berra told Posada that he sometimes swung a 38-ounce ''log'' for a bat. Berra told Posada that he needed to hit, but that defense would make Joe Torre and the pitchers happy.</p>
        <p>''He might be one of the best in the league some day,'' Berra said. ''He's gotten his first chance to start. That makes a kid feel good.''</p>
        <p>That is why Posada is a different kid this season, more relieved and more confident because he is not the co-starter who wound up sitting during a lot of important games. Posada is no longer just Joe Girardi's protege or Derek Jeter's closest friend on the team or the 28-year-old catcher with awesome potential. He is more complete than Girardi, more productive than Jeter (right now, but Jeter will rectify that) and he is finally fulfilling his potential.</p>
        <p>Posada leads the Yankees in homers after not crushing his eighth until July 10 last season, he has 12 hits in his last 17 at-bats and has stroked hits from both sides of the plate in five games. There is one more interesting measure of Posada's rise to prominence. He has Berra, the owner of 10 World Series rings, happily playing glove intermediary for him.</p>
        <p>''He's got to like the way it feels,'' Berra said. ''I did that when I was catching. I tried different things.''</p>
        <p>Different. It is the word that best describes Posada's career these days. When he returned to his apartment in Manhattan after difficult games last year, he could not sleep. He replayed at-bats and worried that he might not start the next game.</p>
        <p>But those feelings do not exist anymore. He is the catcher and a possible All-Star, especially since Torre will choose the midsummer game's reserves. The Yankees play the Devil Rays tonight and Posada will start again.</p>
        <p>''This is what I wanted,'' Posada said. ''I wanted the chance to play every day and get 600 at-bats. Now, if I struggle, I know I've still got tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Posada paused for 10 seconds and stared into his locker, seemingly wondering if he should say something that sounded boastful. Finally, he concluded, ''I always thought this would be the way it would work out.''</p>
