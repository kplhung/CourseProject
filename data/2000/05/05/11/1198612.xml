        <p>Following are excerpts from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's news conference in Bryant Park yesterday, in which he discussed  his marriage to Donna Hanover and his relationship with Judith Nathan, whom he has called a ''very good friend.'' The remarks were recorded by The New York Times.</p>
        <p>The Mayor's Comments</p>
        <p>This is very, very painful. For quite some time it's probably been apparent that Donna and I lead, in many ways, independent and separate lives. It's been a very painful road and I'm hopeful that we'll be able to formalize that in a, in an agreement that protects our children, gives them all the security and all the protection they deserve, and protects Donna.</p>

        <p>Following are excerpts from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's news conference in Bryant Park yesterday, in which he discussed  his marriage to Donna Hanover and his relationship with Judith Nathan, whom he has called a ''very good friend.'' The remarks were recorded by The New York Times.</p>
        <p>The Mayor's Comments</p>
        <p>This is very, very painful. For quite some time it's probably been apparent that Donna and I lead, in many ways, independent and separate lives. It's been a very painful road and I'm hopeful that we'll be able to formalize that in a, in an agreement that protects our children, gives them all the security and all the protection they deserve, and protects Donna.</p>
        <p>And that's something we have to work out and we have to strive toward and -- you know, I'm a public person, I'm elected to public office. I do my job, I think, honestly and effectively and as well as I can. And I, you know, I realize that my private life is open to everyone. I just watch what's going on and I just wish that you'd maybe respect it a little bit more.</p>
        <p>But in any event, you know, we'll do the best that we can to make the decisions that we have to make that are, that are consistent with our own lives and our children. But I don't think I'm saying anything that you haven't, that you haven't all written, that over the course of some period of time in many ways we've grown to live independent and separate lives, and we should probably strive toward formalizing that.</p>
        <p>Questions and Answers</p>
        <p>Q. -- Is that a legal separation, Mr. Mayor?</p>
        <p>MR. GIULIANI -- I -- I would -- I really don't want to go into, any more than I want to go into the great details of, you know, what one doctor said to me or what another doctor said to me, I don't want to get into that. . . .</p>
        <p>Q. -- Would she move out of Gracie Mansion?</p>
        <p>A. -- Nobody, nobody, nobody is, nobody is moving anywhere. Everybody is secure and safe. What I said is that we should try to work out a separation agreement. That's different. . . .</p>
        <p>What I said is what I said, a separation agreement; it's not a divorce.</p>
        <p>Q. -- Mr. Mayor, are you at all motivated by the . . .</p>
        <p>A. -- And I should say -- no. I'm motivated by all of the tremendous invasion of privacy that's taken place in everyone's life, my family's, Judith Nathan's family's. This is something, this is something that has developed over some period of time and it's something between Donna and me, not anyone else, and really not even the whole world, just between Donna and me.</p>
        <p>Q. -- . . . concerned about a backlash?</p>
        <p>A. -- No, you know, I don't really care about politics right now. I don't. I'm thinking about my family, the people that I love and what's, what can be done that's honest and truthful and that protects them the best.</p>
        <p>I'm not thinking about politics. I'm not; politics comes at least second, maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else. It'll all work itself out some way, politically. I'm hoping that if I, maybe if I say something, I mean, some of the things that the news organizations are doing, horrendous. . . .</p>
        <p>Q. -- Are you still running for the Senate?</p>
        <p>A. -- It has nothing to do with the Senate. It has something to do with the fact that there's a tremendous amount of intense scrutiny, and I felt I had to say at least something that explains it.</p>
        <p>Q. -- Has the media caused damage to . . .</p>
        <p>A. -- Of course this is damaging and painful and very, very difficult for everyone. . . . But you have to deal with it honestly and directly. You can't, you can't pretend or hide.</p>
        <p>Q. -- Has the media caused the damage?</p>
        <p>A. -- No. The media makes the damage much worse; it didn't cause the damage. I take responsibility for everything that I've done. And you have every right to ask me, and then I have a right to answer or not answer. And that's the way I think we can have a respectful relationship with each other.</p>
        <p>Q. -- Is the . . . is that affecting your . . . Senate race?</p>
        <p>A. -- I haven't thought about it yet in that context. Maybe I will. I've been thinking about it more in the health context. Judith Nathan is a very, very fine person. She's been a very good friend to me before I had to deal with the decisions that I have to make about my illness and what to do about it, and I rely on her and she helps me a great deal. And I'm going to need her more now than maybe I did before. These are decisions I have to make, you know, at a very difficult time, so ----</p>
        <p>Q. -- She has been more supportive of you than Ms. Hanover? . . .</p>
        <p>A. -- I, my, Donna Hanover is a wonderful woman. And she's a wonderful mother. She's someone that I respect tremendously. The fact that we've grown independent, we've grown more separate over the years; who knows why those things happen? But she is a very, very fine, wonderful person, and she's a, extraordinary mother and I have tremendous respect for her.</p>
        <p>Q. -- What is your emotional . . . right now?</p>
        <p>A. -- My emotional state is, I'm very sad. And I feel terrible. . . .</p>
        <p>Q. -- Does your wife agree with you?</p>
        <p>A. -- My wife speaks for herself, as you know. She made a statement the other day and she'll, she has her right to whatever she wants to say, and Donna, Donna is an independent person and I respect her for that. And there are obviously going to be things that we disagree about, but ----</p>
        <p>Q. -- Is there any chance that you might resign from office?</p>
        <p>A. -- No, there's no chance.</p>
