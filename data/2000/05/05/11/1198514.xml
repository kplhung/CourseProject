        <p>Walk-and-wear hearing is what Dr. Craig Newman, an audiologist at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, calls the new hearing aids he has been dispensing.</p>
        <p>For the past few months, Dr. Newman has been equipping patients with a tiny digital hearing aid (about the size of a raisin) that is easy to fit.</p>
        <p>The device is slipped into a soft foam disposable cover that is much more flexible than the harder coverings of other hearing aids. The foam, with a microchip inside, slides right into the ear canal.</p>
        <p>''The audiologist programs the chip to provide clear sounds, and you are in and out the same day,'' Dr. Newman said.</p>
        <p>The hearing aid, a gray plastic device, is manufactured by Sonic Innovations in Salt Lake City. A patient's hearing is evaluated and an impression is made of the ear. In a few weeks, the patient returns to have the doctor check the fit, Dr. Newman said.</p>
        <p>One patient, Judy Simpson of Magna, Utah, said she liked the device because it eliminated the cleaning chores necessary with her former hearing aid.</p>
        <p>''When the foam cover gets dirty, I can just throw it away and put in a new one,'' she said. ''And because it's so tiny, most people can't see it.</p>
        <p>''They think I've gone in for ear surgery because they can't see a big thing sticking out of my ear.''</p>

        <p>NEWS WATCH  Correction:  May 16, 2000, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, a report in the News Watch column of Circuits on Thursday about an easily applied hearing aid misstated the fitting method. While many other kinds of hearing aids require taking an impression of the ear and having the patient return weeks later, the new device does not.</p>
