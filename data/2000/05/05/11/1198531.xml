        <p>Through the miracle of technology, electronic greeting cards can really save your hide when holidays (like, say, Mother's Day THIS weekend) sneak up on you. But now you can ''care enough to send the very best'' even if you don't have the time to go to the store and buy it.</p>
        <p>SierraHome has just released its Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe software, which will let Windows users customize and print genuine Hallmark and Shoebox greeting cards. There are more than 3,000 cards included in the program's CD-ROM, including many of the same designs that are sold in Hallmark stores.</p>
        <p>The Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe program is not limited to greeting cards. The package includes Snapshot Express, a photo-editing program, as well as event planner software to keep track of birthdays and important dates, 10,000 clip-art images and 20 type fonts. There are also more than 150 templates that can be used to create stationery, postcards, stickers, calendars and other types of personalized products.</p>
        <p>The software also offers card content from Hallmark's Tree of Life category, which focuses on Jewish holidays, as well as from the company's Mahogany line, which offers African-American themes. Maxine, the crabby old woman who is featured in a series from Shoebox Greetings, makes an appearance among the card selections, too.</p>
        <p>Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe can be purchased in software stores or online at www  .hallmarksoftware.com for $49.95 (or $29.95 for a smaller version with less content). Hallmark also sells a selection of cardstock-quality paper,  suitable for use in home printers, that can be ordered from a link on the site.</p>
        <p>And for those who already have electronic postage software, the hardest part of card-sending now might be extracting yourself from your chair to go to the mailbox.</p>
