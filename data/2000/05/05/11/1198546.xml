        <p>Two days after the Sri Lankan government rejected a cease-fire offer, separatist rebels went back on the offensive today in an early morning assault, striving to take back the Jaffna peninsula at the northern tip of Sri Lanka.</p>
        <p>After a week's lull in fighting, the rebels said in a statement from their London office that their latest assault had brought them within two miles of city of Jaffna, the cultural capital of the Tamil-dominated north.</p>
        <p>The government confirmed that the rebels began a strong assault at 3 a.m. and broke through ''a few gaps in the army defenses.'' But it spoke of ''a large number of casualties among the attackers.'' The rebels are known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. They have been fighting for a separate homeland for the Hindu Tamil minority since 1983.</p>
        <p>The rebels controlled Jaffna from 1990 to 1995, but the government reclaimed it in December 1995 and has held it since.</p>
        <p>In recent months, the Tigers have scored a series of gains. They have taken control of large chunks of territory in the sparsely populated, jungle area of Wanni south of the Jaffna peninsula. And on April 22, they overran the government's heavily fortified military base at Elephant Pass, which connects Jaffna to the mainland, and another base a week later.</p>
