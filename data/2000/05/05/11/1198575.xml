        <p>There are 10,000 miles and not much trade between China and the anthracite coal region of eastern Pennsylvania, but for Paul E. Kanjorski, a House Democrat, the two are inseparable.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kanjorski said he told President Clinton and House Republican leaders that he would support extending permanent trading rights to China if they would offer ''assurances'' that his proposed tax breaks to encourage investment in Pennsylvania's distressed coal region will become law before Mr. Clinton leaves office.</p>
        <p>''It's a very tough vote for me and these issues must come together,'' Mr. Kanjorski said flatly this week. ''It's not a vote I'm just going to throw away.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton has stressed for months that Congress must grant China permanent trading rights or risk damaging the competitiveness of American companies and relations with the world's most populous country. But not unlike other high-profile trade votes, this one also involves a host of issues that are purely local, like job retraining and development aid.</p>
        <p>Administration officials warned early this spring that they could not dole out favors for votes, not at the end of Mr. Clinton's term and with Republicans in control of Congress. Commerce Secretary William M. Daley, who is leading the administration's lobbying effort, said lawmakers must make a straight choice or, as he put it, ''walk the plank.''</p>
        <p>But that has not stopped members of Congress from demanding life preservers. With the administration still short of the 218 votes it needs in the House two weeks before the scheduled vote, at least some of the Democrats and Republicans who remain officially uncommitted want pet projects financed.</p>
        <p>The requests may be one reason that 30 lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been coy about how they will vote, a remarkably large number of undecideds given that Congress has had to choose whether to renew China's trade privileges annually for two decades. The administration is now asking Congress to give up that annual review, fulfilling a promise it made to Beijing last year when it negotiated the terms for China's accession to the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>Several Democrats who represent districts with a heavy trade union presence have been especially demanding. They argue that they need some political cover to vote for a measure that unions steadfastly oppose. The administration, if not yet making firm commitments, is at least listening, they say.</p>
        <p>''The industrial unions are vehement about this,'' said Representative James L. Oberstar, a senior Minnesota Democrat. ''They say they'll picket me. I'll take the heat if I can get something done for the people I represent.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Oberstar says he wants the administration to amend the Trade Act of 1974 so that imports of steel slabs can be treated as a direct threat to the taconite miners of northern Minnesota. With Russian and Brazilian slabs flooding the market, Mr. Oberstar said, American blast furnaces no longer use as much taconite, a low-grade iron-ore, to produce raw steel. Several thousands jobs are threatened, he said.</p>
        <p>''Now they have something they really want,'' he said, referring to the China trade bill. What he is asking now, he said, is that the law be modified ''to serve the needs of these people who are hurt.''</p>
        <p>The requests for aid come as the administration and Republican leaders in Congress are locked in a furious battle with opponents of the China trade measure, including senior Congressional Democrats and politically powerful labor unions.</p>
        <p>The House majority whip, Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas, warned today that he would have to engage in ''traditional hand-to-hand combat'' to round up enough Republican votes to pass the measure, dismissing reports that his party already had 150 secure votes. Another Republican leader said that a recent head count of House Republicans found only 120 solid supporters, though administration officials said they still expected at least 20 more Republicans to vote in favor.</p>
        <p>The pendulum swung slightly in favor of opponents today when Representatives David D. Phelps of Illinois and Gene Green of Texas, both Democrats, declared they would vote no. The administration says that it needs a minimum of 70 House Democrats to vote in favor and that it remains 10 to 15 votes shy.</p>
        <p>Whips on both sides of the aisles have been publicly discouraging their caucuses from using the close vote as a chance to extract benefits for their home districts. Asked about Republican pork barreling today, Mr. DeLay said sharply, ''We don't do that.''</p>
        <p>Represenative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat and his party's chief supporter of the bill in the House, also urged lawmakers to make their decision on the bill's merits. ''You can't get cover from labor from a bridge project,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Another of Mr. Clinton major trade priorities, the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Congress approved in 1993, became a political pinata when scores of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle demanded -- and often received -- benefits in exchange for their votes, administration officials acknowledged.</p>
        <p>The China trade measure is not Nafta. It does not require that the United States open its markets wider to imported goods, as Nafta did, and the Congressional demands for district-by-district benefits are much less intense this time, many people involved in the lobbying process said.</p>
        <p>But the lobbying, if less high profile, is hardly invisible. Commerce Secretary Daley flew to Texas late last week to hear more about Representative Ruben Hinojosa's proposed Cross-Border Institute for Regional Development, a plan to create a Silicon Valley in southeastern Texas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley and Mr. Hinojosa, a Democrat who has yet to say which way he is voting on China trade, declined to comment on the trip. But a Congressional aide said that Mr. Hinojosa hoped that a public-private partnership could bring high-tech businesses and jobs to the area.</p>
