        <p>It has been five years since the Devils vanquished the Philadelphia Flyers in a stirring Eastern Conference final series on the way to winning their only Stanley Cup championship.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, the teams will meet in the postseason for the first time since 1995 in Game 1 of the four-of-seven-game series to determine Eastern Conference champion.</p>
        <p>The Devils won four of the five regular-season meetings between the teams this season, and the Flyers, who overtook the Devils late in the season for the best overall record in the conference, are likely to be without their two most physically imposing centers, Eric Lindros and Keith Primeau, because of concussions.</p>
        <p>Primeau was knocked cold from a vicious but clean open-ice hit by Bob Boughner 48 seconds into Philadelphia's 2-1 series-clinching victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Tuesday night. Lindros, meanwhile, has been out since March 13 because of recurrent concussions. Lindros suffered a setback last week -- his third concussion of the season and fifth in two years -- when he collided with a teammate during practice. But the Flyers issued a statement today saying that Lindros could resume practicing May 23. If a Game 6 is necessary, it would be played May 24, and Game 7 would be May 26.</p>
        <p>The Devils, too, are not the same team that defeated the Flyers in 1995, a series that saw the visiting team win the first five games before New Jersey finally prevailed at home in the deciding Game 6.</p>
        <p>Five years later, Claude Lemieux, the recipient of the Conn Smythe Trophy in those 1995 playoffs as the tournament's most valuable player, has just one goal over the first two rounds of this postseason's tournament.</p>
        <p>Bobby Holik and Randy McKay, two-thirds of the Devils' Crash Line in 1995, are playing as if the Crashers have been reborn. Holik, with 23 goals, and McKay, with 16, combined for 39 goals during the regular season. Over the first two rounds of this postseason, Holik and McKay have none.</p>
        <p>Together, Lemieux, Holik and McKay have one goal combined during the tournament. In past postseasons, that would have spelled doom for the Devils.</p>
        <p>No longer.</p>
        <p>''We have a lot of depth,'' defenseman Scott Niedermayer said. ''I think that's been our strength this season. A lot of people said maybe that's been our weakness the last couple of years.''</p>
        <p>What Niedermayer meant was that over the last four seasons, the Devils could be derailed by shutting down their top scorer. They did not qualify for the playoffs in 1996, lost in the second round in 1997, and lost in the first round in 1998 and 1999.</p>
        <p>For example, Holik was second on the team in goals with 27 last season. Two seasons ago, he led the Devils with 29 goals. But Holik was held without a goal in each of the last two postseasons.</p>
        <p>Holik has not scored a postseason goal since 1997. And yet here the Devils are, in the third round.</p>
        <p>''Everybody has a different job to do,'' said Coach Larry Robinson, whom the Devils have rallied around since he took over for the fired Robbie Ftorek with eight games remaining in the regular season. ''It's unfair to say Bobby Holik didn't score a goal or that the other guys aren't playing well. I think they are. They've been getting chances.''</p>
        <p>McKay, who did not practice today because of an illness in his family, and Holik were especially valuable in the Devils' second-round triumph over Toronto. Although they were held scoreless, they held the Maple Leafs' top line, centered by Mats Sundin, to one goal over the six-game series.</p>
        <p>''Bobby may not have scored a goal,'' Ken Daneyko said, ''but he had a tremendous series against Toronto.''</p>
        <p>Robinson said: ''We've asked Bobby to go against other teams' top players, to think defense first. I would worry if he and Claude and Randy weren't getting any chances. But they are.''</p>
        <p>And even if Holik, Lemieux and McKay aren't burying them, their other teammates are.</p>
        <p>''This team has a lot of depth,'' Holik said. ''It's a team that relies on 20 players, not 5, not 7, not 2.''</p>
        <p>That has been the Devils' philosophy, but Holik added, ''We didn't necessarily have the 20 guys playing the way we can.''</p>
        <p>That might explain all those early exits since 1995, the last time the Devils and the Flyers met when it mattered most.</p>
