        <p>MARANO-Gary R. The Upper West Side is mourning the sudden untimely death of entrepreneur Gary Marano, 47, an owner of the Raccoon Lodge who was killed in a motorcycle accident in Montauk on Sunday, May 7, 2000. Awardwinning artist, photographer, sailing enthusiast, world traveler and theatrical producer, Mr. Marano was known for treating his patrons as family by keeping the bars open on Thanksgiving and Christmas as a haven for ''holiday orphans.'' Every December, there would be a day when 83rd Street and Amsterdam Avenue became a sea of Harley-Davidsons, as Mr. Marano's friends gathered for the annual Toys for Tots Run to St. Mary's Hospital for Children in Bayside, Queens. His family, friends, godchildren, employees and patrons will miss him profoundly. Mr. Marano is survived by his mother, Dorothy and two brothers, Thomas and Michael. Viewing will be held on Thursday, 2-4PM and 7-9PM at Hungerford and Clark Funeral Home, 110 Pine Street, Freeport, LI. 516-379-3119. Memorial Service May 13, 2000 at 4PM at NY Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, NY, NY.</p>
