        <p>The Pentagon is assessing the risk to national security of cutting its nuclear arsenal to 2,000 warheads under an arms-reduction treaty with Russia, a step that could help President Clinton broker a missile-defense deal with Moscow before he leaves office, administration officials say.</p>
        <p>The highly classified review has been under way for months, but it has intensified in recent weeks in advance of Mr. Clinton's scheduled summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin early next month in Moscow.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the commander of the strategic arsenal, Adm. Richard W. Mies, will hold the latest in a series of meetings in the ''tank,'' a supersecure conference room in the Pentagon, to gauge the effects of deeper cuts.</p>
        <p>In two weeks, the findings and recommendations are expected to be sent to Mr. Cohen and to Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for final approval before the assessment is delivered to Mr. Clinton in preparation for the Moscow meeting.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to get a better understanding of the risk at the lower numbers and whether we can still meet the deterrent strategy,'' said a senior Pentagon official involved in the study. ''It's a prudent thing to do with the summit coming up.''</p>
        <p>The American strategic nuclear arsenal includes 7,200 warheads. Russia has 6,000.</p>
        <p>In Helsinki three years ago, Mr. Clinton and Boris N. Yeltsin, who was then president of Russia, agreed to cut the number of long-range warheads on each side to no more than 2,000 to 2,500 by the end of 2007 by negotiating a third strategic arms reduction treaty, Start III. The two leaders reaffirmed their pledge in June in Cologne, Germany, although Russia is pushing for both countries to go even lower, to 1,500 warheads.</p>
        <p>Despite the official American negotiating position that Start III levels range from 2,000 to 2,500 warheads, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have always said they would need at least 2,500 warheads to carry out the nation's nuclear war plan, which is thought to include thousands of individual targets on potentially hostile territory. The new review is testing whether that assumption continues to hold.</p>
        <p>Start III has become a bargaining chip for the administration, which has offered to carry it out if Moscow agrees to what American officials describe as modest changes to the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972. Those changes would allow the United States to field a limited missile defense system that administration officials say is intended to protect the United States against missile strikes from countries like Iran, Iraq and North Korea or an accidental launching from a superpower.</p>
        <p>But Russia opposes such a defense, leaving administration officials searching for ways to enhance the incentives for Moscow to change its mind. Part of the solution may lie in lower Start III force levels.</p>
        <p>''The overall purpose is to take stock of how it all plays out, and if there is any chance of potentially lower numbers,'' said a second senior Defense Department official involved in the assessment.</p>
        <p>For now at least, the review is confined to examining the risks at various levels in the 2,000-to-2,500 range, administration officials said. ''We are not looking outside the range, and no one has come to us yet with pressure to say, we need to go below those numbers,'' said a third senior Pentagon official.</p>
        <p>But some White House and State Department officials are asking what military officials consider leading questions going down to 2,000 and slightly below what Pentagon officials call ''the red line.'' Some American arms negotiators believe that if the review finds that the military could fulfill its strategic deterrent mission with 2,000 warheads, then diplomats could finesse the differences with Russia and propose a range of 1,500 to 2,000 warheads.</p>
        <p>''What we're seeing is an attempt on the part of the administration to accommodate the Russians without having to change the definition of deterrence,'' said one former top military officer who is wary of deeper reductions. ''Two thousand warheads was the absolute most painful level for the military. Now they're going back, I'm afraid, and taking the floor and using it to make a new ceiling.''</p>
        <p>The assessment and its potential implications have divided the government. Some civilian experts in the Defense Department, State Department and National Security Council are open to deeper cuts. The Joint Chiefs of Staff is opposed to reductions that they believe could hurt national security and set off -- not discourage -- a new arms race.</p>
        <p>''The chiefs are concerned about arms reductions that reduce the flexibility in the strategic deterrence and put at risk maintaining all three legs of the triad,'' said Capt. Steven R. Pietropaoli, a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
        <p>The triad is the fleet of submarines, bombers and long-range missiles that carry nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>One way that the Pentagon is considering reducing the Start III levels, at least on paper, is through the arcane counting rules for nuclear weapons. At any given moment, not all submarines are at sea or bombers on alert. Military officials are considering whether to count, at least in one measure, only those nuclear weapons that are ready to perform the mission. That could reduce the Start III levels by 200 to 300 so-called ''phantom'' warheads, administration officials said, and approach the 2,000 figure at the lower end of the range.</p>
        <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff are also weighing various combinations of submarines, bombers and long-range missiles -- called the force structure -- to see if the nuclear deterrent can be maintained at lower overall numbers.</p>
        <p>Some American military officials argue that for cost reasons, Russia is reducing its strategic forces. Alexei Arbatov, deputy chairman of the Russian Parliament Defense Committee, said at a conference here this week that if Russia were forced to keep Start I levels (6,000 warheads), it would cost $33 billion over 10 years; at Start II levels (3,000 to 3,500 warheads), $26 billion over 10 years; and at Start III levels, $14 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>''We've been involved in discussions with the Joint Staff about various alternatives, none of which I'm permitted to talk about,'' said Capt. Ron Morse, a spokesman for the United States Strategic Command, which Admiral Mies heads.</p>
        <p>By law, the United States is required to maintain at least the levels of Start, signed by Washington and Moscow in 1991 and in force since 1994, until Start II goes into effect. Start II was signed in 1993 and approved by the Senate in 1995, but it was not until last month that the Russian Parliament gave its own backing to the accord. And the Senate still has to vote on ratifying several protocols to Start II before it goes into effect.</p>
        <p>On Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats are sharply divided over the proposed deeper reductions.</p>
        <p>Representative Curt Weldon, Republican of Pennsylvania, accused the administration today of considering unilateral cuts down to 1,500 warheads, a position that the White House denied. ''This is all part of a rush to have Bill Clinton do something that he hopes will capture the imagination of the American people,'' Mr. Weldon said in an interview. ''but it's not rooted in substance.''</p>
        <p>The House Armed Services Committee rejected today, 40 to 17, a proposal by Representative Tom Allen, Democrat of Maine, to permit the Pentagon to reduce unilaterally its strategic forces to Start II levels before the treaty actually enters into force.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon supports such a measure. The military estimates, for example, that maintaining the 50 Peacekeeper missiles that are retired under Start II will cost $1 billion through 2007.</p>
        <p>Many Senate Democrats, including Carl Levin of Michigan and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, say the country can maintain a nuclear deterrent with far fewer than 2,000 to 2,500 weapons.</p>
        <p>''You can sustain a lower number politically,  provided that number is viewed not as a political number, but as a security number coming from the people responsible for security planning,'' Mr. Levin recently told the Arms Control Association. ''But if it is done as something that is done politically, it will not have the kind of support that it should.''</p>
