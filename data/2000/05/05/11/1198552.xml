        <p>Prices of Treasury securities were up sharply yesterday, lifted by a successful government note auction and steep losses in the stock market.</p>
        <p>The Treasury sold $8 billion of new 10-year notes, an auction that market participants said had results in line with expectations. The notes were awarded at a price to yield 6.475 percent.</p>
        <p>In when-issued trading leading up to the sale, the notes were being offered at a price to yield 6.48 percent, down from 6.52 the previous day. The actively traded 10-year note was yielding 6.42 percent yesterday, down from 6.52 percent on Tuesday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, increased 23/32, to 100 18/32.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was up 26/32, to 101 13/32. The bond's yield fell to 6.15 percent from 6.21 percent.</p>
        <p>Kim Rupert, economist at Standard &amp; Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm, said ''the weakness in equities gave a boost to Treasuries.''</p>
        <p>With most participants expecting a tightening of half a percentage point next week by the Federal Reserve, Ms. Rupert said the market will quickly turn its speculation to the June and August meetings. A tame Consumer Price Index report next Tuesday could diminish thoughts of a similar increase in June.</p>
        <p>Eric Cheung, vice president at the Asset Management Departmant/ Fixed-Income Division of Wilmington Trust in Wilmington, Del., said the bond market had incorporated an aggressive Fed move into its rate structure. ''Equities have pretty well passed the height of earnings releases and are likely to seek a trading range while waiting for the Fed to hand out its next batch of medicine,'' Mr. Cheung said. ''We will just have to wait to see if it is a single dose or a double shot.''</p>
        <p>The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new 10-year notes:</p>
        <p>(000 omitted in dollar figures)</p>
        <p>Price: 100.153  High Yield: 6.475%  Low Yield: 6.400%  Median Yield: 6.450%  Total applied for: $24,010,987  Accepted: $11,075,987  Noncompetitive: $108,592  Interest set at: 6 1/2</p>
        <p>The 10-year notes mature on Feb. 15, 2010.</p>
