        <p>NUMEROFF-Seymour G., D.D.S. Of Roslyn Heights, NY. May 9, 2000. Age 75. After a long and valiant struggle against kidney disease. Devoted husband of Harriet. Beloved father of Gil and Robin, Nancy and Neil, Jane and Kenneth. Adored grandfather of Lauren, Jaime, Matthew, Alexandra and Jonathan. Served as a Captain in the U.S. Army. Practiced Dentistry in Mineola with a large and devoted following for 53 years and was a six-time champion golfer. His kindness, intelligence and care touched all who knew and loved him. He leaves this world a better place, though his passing leaves a void that can never be filled. Dr. Numeroff is also survived by a brother Marvin, sister-in-law Alice, her husband Paul, six nieces and nephews and many dear friends. Services today 11:45 AM at Gutterman's, 8000 Jericho Turnpike, Woodbury, LI. Interment following at Beth Moses Cemetery, Pinelawn, NY. In lieu of flowers, please make a donation in his name to The Kidney Foundation.</p>
        <p>NUMEROFF-Dr. Seymour. With great sorrow we mark the death of our cherished and beloved friend, Sy. He was truly a man of great dignity with whom we shared our most memorable days. Our deepest sympathies extend to his loving wife, Harriett, who gave both physically and emotionally. May his children and grandchildren have only beautiful memories. The Kahn and Patricof Families</p>
        <p>NUMEROFF-Dr. Seymour G. It is with deep sorrow that we record the untimely passing of our esteemed member, Dr. Seymour G. Numeroff, and extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Harriet, and children, Gilbert, Nancy, Jane and their families. Old Westbury Golf and Country Club Barry Swidler, President Herb Selzer, Secretary</p>
        <p>NUMEROFF-Seymour G. Daddy, we had a terrific relationship. You are and will always be forever in my heart. We had a silly habit of reading these. I know you're reading this today. I love you forever, hugs and kisses, Nancy</p>
