        <p>Those who play in tournaments and clubs are familiar with the bidding box, a Swedish device that permits bids to be displayed in clear fashion on the table. The result is good for those with hearing disabilities, reviews of the auction are unnecessary, bids are not overheard at adjoining tables, and noise levels are diminished.</p>
        <p>These boxes are used throughout the bridge world with one substantial exception. For half a century countries in the Far East and the South Pacific have used written bidding, which has similar advantages: players write their bids on a printed paper in the center of the table.</p>

        <p>Those who play in tournaments and clubs are familiar with the bidding box, a Swedish device that permits bids to be displayed in clear fashion on the table. The result is good for those with hearing disabilities, reviews of the auction are unnecessary, bids are not overheard at adjoining tables, and noise levels are diminished.</p>
        <p>These boxes are used throughout the bridge world with one substantial exception. For half a century countries in the Far East and the South Pacific have used written bidding, which has similar advantages: players write their bids on a printed paper in the center of the table.</p>
        <p>Imagine a game in which almost all the players are speaking Chinese, and written bidding is in use. Where do you suppose this is? Beijing? Shanghai? Hong Kong? Taipei? Or perhaps Singapore?</p>
        <p>The right answer, surprisingly, is the Chinese Cultural Center in Flushing, Queens, where 11 teams, from New York City, Long Island, New Jersey and the Albany area, battled on Sunday for the Hai Hua Cup. The annual event was organized by Thomas Chen of Great Neck, N.Y., and was won by Ke-Ning Sheng of East Brunswick, N.J., Jinming Liao of Iselin, N.J., Peter Chen of Fresh Meadows, Queens, and Cheng-He Su of Flushing.</p>
        <p>On the diagramed deal the winners were helped by an opponent who used a T.I.L.H.Y.W. bid. That stands for ''tails I lose, heads you win'' and might be called a fielder's choice. South passed after the one-spade opening bid by Peter Chen, East, but emerged with a three-diamond bid at his second turn in the face of unfavorable vulnerability. Such bids do nothing to inconvenience the opposition players and give them the opportunity to double for penalties if they choose.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sheng, sitting West, did so choose and would have hit the jackpot if he had led a trump. This is often the right move in a doubled contract when the defense clearly has the vast majority of the high cards. Whether or not dummy can score a ruff or two can be crucial, and there is seldom any urgency to cash winners.</p>
        <p>After a trump lead, East would have won with the ace. He would then have had to judge what to do. A shift to clubs would have permitted West to gain the lead and remove dummy's remaining trump. South would then have emerged with just five tricks for a penalty of 1,100, since he cannot avoid four heart losers.</p>
        <p>In practice West made the obvious lead of the spade king, and South escaped for down two, 500. He was able to use both dummy's trumps for ruffing hearts. In the replay East-West bid to four spades and made exactly 10 tricks, so the winners gained 2 imps. But it could have been much more.</p>
