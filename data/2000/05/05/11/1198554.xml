        <p>A seven-member United Nations Security Council delegation ended a weeklong trip to Africa today unable to persuade the leaders of Eritrea and Ethiopia to stop preparing for war and to return instead to the negotiating table.</p>
        <p>Within the next few days, the diplomats said, they expect to begin discussing what steps the Security Council can take to put more pressure on Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia and President Isais Afwerki of Eritrea to pull back from battle over a disputed border.</p>
        <p>The ambassadors, from the United States, Britain, France, Mali, Namibia, the Netherlands and Tunisia, left a series of meetings with the Eritrean and Ethiopian leaders disappointed to varying degrees.</p>
        <p>Specifically, delegates cited lack of concern shown by the countries' leaders, both former guerrillas, when asked to consider the human consequences of a war the diplomats unanimously call ''senseless.''</p>
        <p>''Neither of these two has a sleepless night over this,'' an ambassador said of Mr. Meles and Mr. Isais, who had in recent years been held up as positive examples of a new generation of pragmatic African politicians.</p>
        <p>As leaders of separate nationalist rebel movements that fought the Ethiopian government for three decades, they were once in alliance. War broke out between them unexpectedly in 1998, years after Mr. Meles had become prime minister of Ethiopia, and Mr. Isais had successfully seceded to form the independent nation of Eritrea, taking with him the only Red Sea port at Assab.</p>
        <p>At a news conference at Asmara airport today, Richard C. Holbrooke, the American ambassador to the United Nations and the leader of the delegation, was asked whether Mr. Meles and Mr. Isais had decided to go to war and whether any admonition from the Security Council would make a difference.</p>
        <p>''I can only say, with great reluctance and foreboding, that the welfare of the peoples of this region does not receive the priority that we think it should in the determination of this issue,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The delegation's unusual field trip ended with questions still hanging over agreements with several other African nations, specifically those involved in the war in Congo, the former Zaire. One agreement, with the President Laurent Kabila of Congo is to open the way for the eventual stationing of United Nations peacekeeping troops in the country.</p>
        <p>After the unraveling last week of a United Nations peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone, council members say that they are more determined than ever to see that a mission to Congo is deployed carefully and commanded effectively.</p>
        <p>The mission in Sierra Leone has been criticized as being below strength and poorly commanded by an Indian general, Vijay Kumar Jetley. The mission intended for Congo is smaller than that in Sierra Leone, though Congo is many times larger.</p>
        <p>The Security Council delegation, which began its trip on May 3 in Brussels, visited not only Congo, but also Zambia, where a Congo peace accord was signed almost a year ago; Zimbabwe, which supports Mr. Kabila with troops; and Rwanda and Uganda, two nations that once supported Mr. Kabila but are now fighting him with their troops and through rebel groups.</p>
        <p>The envoys said that most of the leaders they met want to get out of the Congo war.</p>
