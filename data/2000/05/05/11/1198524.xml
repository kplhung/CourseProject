        <p>No one may ever know whether the convergence of Mrs. O'Leary's cow and a lantern started the Great Fire of Chicago on Oct. 8, 1871, even though it is known that the blaze began in or near the O'Leary barn. There was a months-long drought that year, and Chicago had thousands of wooden buildings and miles and miles of wood-paved streets and sidewalks to burn.</p>
        <p>The Great Conflagration, as it was called, is chronicled on the site of the Chicago Historical Society, with a written account and photographs and prints of the city before and after the event (www.chicagohistory.org/fire/intro  /gcf-index.html). The site also describes relief efforts and the city's recovery.</p>

        <p>The Great Fire overshadowed another huge blaze that same night.</p>
        <p>On Oct. 8, 1871, Peshtigo, Wis., a lumber town not far from Green Bay, was devastated along with 1.25 million acres of surrounding forest. Nearly 1,200 people died.</p>
