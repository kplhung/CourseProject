        <p>After more than six months in winter quarters at Aqueduct, racing returned to Belmont Park yesterday on a chilly afternoon with spectators almost as hard to find as rivals for Fusaichi Pegasus in next week's Preakness.</p>
        <p>But drama was not missing from Belmont's opening day even though spectators were. Only 5,232 fans were counted as a 3-year-old filly named C'est L'Amour pulled the first upset of the season when she slipped along the rail and nipped Tugger in the final strides of the $100,000 Nassau County.</p>
        <p>The filly, a daughter of Thunder Gulch trained by P. G. Johnson with Edgar Prado riding, won for the third time in four starts at 10-1 odds. She ran the seven furlongs in 1:232/5  and paid $22.40 for a $2 bet after a big finish that defeated Tugger, Miss Inquisitive and Finder's Fee.</p>
        <p>''She broke well, sat behind the pace and settled nicely,'' Prado reported. ''In the stretch, it looked like Tugger was drifting in on us, but we were able to get through.''</p>
        <p>Racing will continue at Belmont Park for 55 days, Wednesday through Sunday. Post time is 1 P.M., except on Fridays, when Sunset Racing will be tried again, starting at 3 P.M. This will include June 9, the Friday before the Belmont Stakes, the third and final test in the Triple Crown. The 55-day spring and summer meeting, which runs through July 23, the week that Saratoga opens, will feature 38 stakes with purses totaling $7.6 million.</p>
        <p>If Fusaichi Pegasus wins the Preakness, as he is expected to do after his powerful performance in the Kentucky Derby last Saturday, he will be the fourth horse in four years to advance on the Belmont with the Triple Crown within reach. The others -- Silver Charm, Real Quiet and Charismatic -- met cruel fates in the final strides of the Belmont before record crowds.</p>
        <p>The Preakness, second test in the Triple Crown, will be run one week from Saturday at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, but will be skipped by almost all of the 18 colts who were outrun by Fusaichi Pegasus last Saturday in the Kentucky Derby.</p>
        <p>Fusaichi Pegasus, who will remain at Churchill Downs until next week, returned to the track this morning for some light jogging. His trainer, Neil Drysdale, said that he saw no reason not to aim the horse for the Preakness at this time.</p>
        <p>Only High Yield, who finished 15th, and Hal's Hope, who ran 16th, were considered certain to again try Fusaichi Pegasus. And two horses who did not make the Derby, Red Bullet and Snuck In, were also ticketed for Pimlico. Hal's Hope was the first confirmed Preakness starter to arrive when his van completed the 12-hour trip from Louisville at 5 a.m. yesterday.</p>
        <p>Apart from those four, though, rivals for ''the flying horse'' were still not too eager to test him again.</p>
        <p>Aptitude, second in the Derby, and Wheelaway, who finished fifth, will skip the Preakness but wait for the Belmont Stakes. The Deputy, who ran 14th after winning the Santa Anita Derby, is headed home to California. His trainer, Jenine Sahadi, said she would rest him for a month or so and then race him on grass instead of dirt. Anees, last year's juvenile champion, who ran 13th in the Derby, will be sidelined for a month or two back home in California with a swelling in an ankle.</p>
        <p>''That horse is a freak,'' said Alex Hassinger Jr., the trainer of Anees, throwing a salute to Fusaichi Pegasus. ''I don't know why you'd want to run against him right now.''</p>
        <p>Bob Baffert said that he would not make a Preakness decision on Captain Steve, who ran eighth in the Derby, until the weekend. And Todd Pletcher said that Impeachment, third in the Derby, and More Than Ready, fourth, were not likely to come back in the Preakness. A more realistic scenario, he said, would be for Impeachment to wait for the Belmont and for More Than Ready to aim for the Haskell at Monmouth in August.</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>RICHARD MIGLIORE, who rode Wheelaway in the Kentucky Derby, was suspended for a week by Churchill Downs stewards yesterday for what they deemed careless riding during the race. Migliore, who races out of Belmont Park, was suspended from Saturday though May 19. As the Derby horses made their final turn and entered the stretch, Wheelaway contended for the lead. But near midstretch, the horse drifted toward the rail and bumped Captain Steve, who then brushed China Visit on the inside. Captain Steve came out of the race with skin torn from his heels, said his assistant trainer, APRIL MAYBERRY. . . . GEORGE STEINBRENNER, principal owner of the Yankees, and RICHARD SANTULLI, a former investment banker with Goldman Sachs and chairman of Executive Jet, were elected to the board of trustees of the New York Racing Association at the board's regular meeting yesterday. Steinbrenner, a former president of Tampa Bay Downs, has been the owner of the Kinsman Farm in Ocala, Fla., since 1970.</p>
