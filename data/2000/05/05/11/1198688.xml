        <p>Judith Nathan, the woman whom Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani calls a ''very good friend,'' is an executive at a drug company who lives on the Upper East Side with her 15-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani and Ms. Nathan have both declined to say how they met or explain the nature of their relationship, asking reporters to respect their privacy. But they have increasingly been seen together at events attended by the mayor, like parades, as well as at private meals at restaurants.</p>
        <p>The mayor first responded to questions about their relationship on May 3, the day that The New York Post published photos of them together leaving a restaurant on the Upper East Side.</p>
        <p>Last night, Ms. Nathan, like the mayor and his wife, pleaded with reporters for privacy.</p>
        <p>''I do feel that enough has been said today,'' she told WABC-TV news outside her apartment building. ''I do hope that you all will now give the mayor the respect and the privacy that he has earned in order to make the appropriate medical decisions.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Nathan, who is licensed as a nurse in New York State and whose maiden name is Stish, was married for several years to Bruce Nathan before the two had a contested divorce. The divorce included a dispute over the custody of their daughter, who attends a private school on the Upper East Side, people who know Ms. Nathan said.</p>
        <p>At his news conference yesterday, Mr. Giuliani called Ms. Nathan ''a very, very fine person'' and said that because of his illness, ''I'm going to need her more now than maybe I did before.''</p>
        <p>A former boyfriend of Ms. Nathan's, Manos Zacharioudakis, said he had a long relationship with her until they ''ran out of steam'' last year. Mr. Zacharioudakis, a psychologist who said he works for the city's hospitals agency, praised Ms. Nathan, saying that she was a wonderful mother. ''If there is going to be a next Mrs. Giuliani, she is going to make a perfect wife,'' Mr. Zacharioudakis said. ''She is an extraordinary individual.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zacharioudakis would not disclose the name of the company where Ms. Nathan works.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zacharioudakis said Ms. Nathan's relationship with her ex-husband was ''very difficult. Even after the end, their communications afterward were extremely difficult, in terms of arrangements with their daughter.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nathan did not respond to two messages left for him at his home last night.</p>
