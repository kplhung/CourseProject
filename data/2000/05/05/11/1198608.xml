        <p>The legal protest that Microsoft filed yesterday in reply to the government's plan to break up the company is an essay of grim futurism.</p>
        <p>Microsoft calls the government plan a ''draconian'' and ''speculative'' proposal that would bring ''uncertainty and chaos.'' Employees, the company says, would leave in droves. Its business would be destroyed, and the industry and consumers would ''suffer enormous harm.''</p>
        <p>The apocalyptic passages seem intended to warn Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that splitting up Microsoft would be a dangerous gamble to take with a company that is a pillar of the nation's high-technology economy. Such a step would be particularly risky, Microsoft insists, because it is ''legally baseless'' -- out of all proportion to the evidence in the antitrust trial and even to Judge Jackson's ruling that Microsoft is a monopoly that illegally used its market power.</p>
        <p>The remedy phase of a Federal antitrust trial is far more art than science. The enforcement provisions say simply that the sanctions should ''prevent and restrain'' the monopolist from violating the law. The court's first task is to restore competition, but the remedies should not entail unacceptable costs.</p>
        <p>Economists, lawyers and technical experts can all offer their views. But in the end, the court must make a difficult judgment -- both about what may happen in the future and about the corporate character of Microsoft. What will it take to restrain the monopolist? Slice it up? Shackle it with harsh curbs on its conduct? Mandate more modest conduct remedies?</p>
        <p>''The judge has to make an informed hunch about how things are likely to play out,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school. ''It's not really some exact science.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft's filing, in a sense, is the latest salvo in its long-running legal battle with the government to define the scope of the antitrust case. Much of Microsoft's future will hinge on whether the courts eventually lean toward the software maker's narrower definition of the case or the government's broader one.</p>
        <p>In Microsoft's view, the case against it is quite limited. The suit, as the company sees it, centers on its product-design decision to fold Internet-browsing software into its Windows operating system, and on some of its contracts with industry partners and rivals. Judge Jackson ruled that Microsoft illegally tied its browser to its monopoly product -- its Windows operating system -- and that some of its contracts were an illegal use of its monopoly muscle.</p>
        <p>The company intends to appeal Judge Jackson's ruling against it.</p>
        <p>In the government's view, the ''browser war'' that pitted Microsoft against the Netscape Communications Corporation, an Internet pioneer now part of America Online, is a central portion of the case yet one episode among many. When the suit was filed by the Justice Department and state attorneys general in May 1998, it spoke of Microsoft's tactics against Netscape as part of a ''pattern of practices.''</p>
        <p>Before the case went to trial in October 1998, the government added evidence involving dealings with Intel, Apple, Sun Microsystems and others. Microsoft protested that the new evidence should not be admitted, but Judge Jackson allowed it.</p>
        <p>Microsoft, the government asserted, was a repeat offender of the nation's antitrust laws. When the government submitted its proposed remedies two weeks ago, it warned that Microsoft was again on the march. The government said Microsoft was trying to use its monopoly in personal computer desktop operating systems to unfairly gain an advantage in the markets for handheld devices like Palm digital assistants and for big server machines that power computer networks.</p>
        <p>''The government's main argument for a breakup,'' said Eleanor M. Fox, a professor at New York University law school, ''is that we can't trust Microsoft -- that it has squeezed out competitors in the past and it will continue to squeeze out competitors.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft cried foul again yesterday, saying the government's comments on handheld devices and server computers were beyond the scope of the trial. If the court was going to consider a breakup or severe sanctions on its conduct, the company said it would need months to gather new evidence and testimony.</p>
        <p>Microsoft offered its limited compromise proposal. But it was a selection of items -- and not the complete list -- that the company had offered in its periodic settlement talks with the Justice Department and the states over the last two years. Microsoft proposed to open its contracts with personal computer makers to give them greater freedom to alter the Windows desktop screen; to limit its use of exclusionary contracts, and to share widely with the computer industry the technical information on Windows.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department and the states dismissed the Microsoft offer as less than the company had put on the negotiating table in the past to no avail. ''It's a step back from where we were,'' said Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general. ''Microsoft is still in denial.''</p>
        <p>In its filing yesterday, Microsoft warned that consumers and the software industry would suffer if the company was split up and its programmers from various product groups could no longer collaborate freely. The government has proposed breaking Microsoft into two companies -- one with the Windows operating-system business, while the other would get the Office application programs like Word and the Excel spreadsheet software, as well as most other operations including the MSN Internet business.</p>
        <p>Microsoft executives describe a series of examples of teamwork across the Office and Windows divide. The Office group first developed the tool bar feature, the bar at the bottom of the Windows desktop with icons for starting different software applications, in 1991. But the company's executives decided that feature should be on all Windows machines. So the group was transferred to the Windows side of the company.</p>
        <p>In April 1999, 25 programmers from the Office group were moved over to the Windows 2000 development team, after they came up with technology code-named Darwin. The technology reduced the cost of installing and managing software across networks of desktop PC's in corporations and business.</p>
        <p>''That sort of cooperation would be impossible if the government got its way,'' a senior Microsoft official said. ''The result is that the cost to users would be higher.''</p>
        <p>Some benefits of being an integrated software company, computer experts say, might be lost if Microsoft was split up. But they also note that the company's Windows business has also bought and borrowed freely from non-Microsoft software developers.</p>
        <p>From Internet software to data compression to multimedia, the computer experts note, Microsoft has acquired the basic intellectual property from outside the company and then refined and improved it. Each of the two successor companies proposed by the government would certainly have ample resources to continue to acquire new technology, as they would split Microsoft's $21 billion nest egg of cash.</p>
        <p>''If Office and Windows were separate companies, it's not obvious that there would be huge efficiency losses,'' said Scott Winkler, an independent technology consultant in Fairfield, Conn.</p>
        <p>Indeed, some analysts say Microsoft may have a difficult time in court explaining the case for the overriding benefits of being an integrated company.</p>
        <p>Hal Varian, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, said: ''Microsoft has always said that it is totally open with non-Microsoft developers and does not discriminate in favor of Office. Yet now it is arguing that the two businesses are highly interactive, and we achieve these efficiency gains by close communication. It's hard for Microsoft to have it both ways.''</p>
        <p>But analysts also question the government argument -- that a breakup is needed because Microsoft, left unchecked, threatens to use its desktop monopoly to capture the markets for servers and handheld devices. Microsoft, they note, has made some inroads into the server market, but it has been unable to compete effectively against Sun, Oracle and I.B.M., whose industrial-strength software is the preferred choice of large companies.</p>
        <p>Similarly, they add, Microsoft has been unable to dent Palm's dominance in handhelds, even though those machines must work smoothly with Windows PC's.</p>
        <p>''Microsoft has proven over and over that owning the desktop does not guarantee success in adjacent markets,'' said Mr. Winkler, the technology consultant. ''Palm, Sun and Oracle are crushing Microsoft in other markets.''</p>
        <p>What Happens Next</p>
        <p>The proceedings from this point could be simple and short, or long and complex, depending on decisions by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. A government counterresponse to Microsoft's filing is due next Wednesday. Otherwise, the only scheduled event is a hearing on May 24 at which both sides are to present arguments on the remedy question.</p>
        <p>But Microsoft has requested months for preparation and witness testimony, while the Justice Department says the remedy stage can be wrapped up in a week after the May 24 hearing. The judge, at the hearing or in a chambers conference, will decide how much time he is willing to devote. Previously, he has said he wants to complete the remedy phase by the end of May.</p>
