        <p>The glassmaker Steuben may not be known for cutting-edge style, but it has attracted some of the design world's leading lights for an inaugural exhibition in its new store, at 667 Madison Avenue (61st Street), formerly the Shanghai Tang emporium. The show, called ''Celebrating by Design'' and produced with the Design Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS, will take place in the 6,000-square-foot Corning Inc. Gallery downstairs, which, along with the store, will open to the public at noon on May 18. For the exhibition, fashion designers, architects and interior designers were asked to intepret celebratory moments. In ''Zen Bride'' (drawing, inset), Isabel and Ruben Toledo use an elegant Pucci-designed mannequin, posed in a quilted organdy wedding gown, trailing past a single Steuben bowl. Avi Adler, the artist and event designer, is working with Kate Spade, the accessories designer, on Valentine's Day (above), in which Steuben's whimsical crystal heart collection is showcased in a room upholstered with silk roses and washed in brilliant red light. Other contributors are Richard Meier, David Rockwell, Courtney Sloane, Ali Tayar, Adam Tihany and Eric W. Warner. The 2,500-square-foot space, Ralph Appelbaum's first store design, will include innovative display tables with embedded screens (in the rendering above) to show video compositions of, for instance, a flower vase, with flowers blooming beneath it.</p>
