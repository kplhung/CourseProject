        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''College Education Seen as Essential'' (news article, May 4) recycles outdated notions of an opposition between the ''tenets of the liberal arts'' and job-related skills.</p>
        <p>As we reported in a recent study, contemporary approaches to liberal education emphasize critical inquiry and analysis, work with unscripted problems, collaborative projects, technological literacy, diversity and global studies. Through service learning and internship programs, liberal arts students are connecting the classroom with their communities.</p>
        <p>The conventional opposition between useful and liberal learning only encourages first-generation students to seek less from college than they need and deserve. Students who experience narrow training instead of intellectual challenge will be blocked, whether or not they hold a degree.</p>
        <p>CAROL SCHNEIDER  President, Association of American  Colleges and Universities  Washington, May 5, 2000</p>
