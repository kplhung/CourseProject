        <p>CONSIDERING the appeal of gels you can eat (Jell-O in the sandbox years, salmon aspic in your Julia Child phase), why has it taken so long for gels to become an ingredient in furnishings?</p>
        <p>Gel, also called techno-gel, is a semiliquid polyurethane. It is notable for its elasticity and for its ability to absorb shock and conform to or ''remember'' shapes. It was first used by the orthopedic industry on hospital mattresses, wheelchair seats and wrist and arm rests. Gel seats cushion aging bikers, too.</p>
        <p>Designers are attracted to its natural translucence and jewel-bright color quality. Rem Koolhaas, the Pritzker Prize-winning architect, called for gel seating when renovating the Second Stage Theater on West 43rd Street. At the new Brasserie on East 53rd Street, gel bar stools are as pliant as the bartenders.</p>
        <p>This week, Moss, at 146 Greene Street, introduces Soft, a chaise longue created by Werner Aisslinger for Zanotta. A clear, blue or orange gel mattress sits on an aluminum and fiberglass grid, making the chaise look like a space-age waffle. It's heavy, but durable enough for outdoor use (though at $4,175, better lock it up). Keen to dip into gel as the trend takes shape, Totem, at 71 Franklin Street, will have gel-based pieces by Mr. Aisslinger this fall.</p>
        <p>''It's catching on fast,'' said Liat Margolis, the research director of Material Connexion, the materials archive. ''For a lot of people,'' she said, ''anything that looks like Gummi Bears is a good thing.''</p>
