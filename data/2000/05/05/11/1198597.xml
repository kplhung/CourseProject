        <p>A children's advocacy group that has won court-ordered changes in foster care systems in New York and elsewhere filed a federal class-action lawsuit today to force an overhaul of Tennessee's foster care system.</p>
        <p>The suit says thousands of Tennessee children are languishing in foster care, in violation of federal law, neither being returned to their parents nor being made available for adoption. Many are kept in emergency shelters for months, the suit says, and some 2,000 children have been moved from home to home 10 or more times. The complaint also says no concerted effort is being made to find adoptive parents for many of the children.</p>

        <p>A children's advocacy group that has won court-ordered changes in foster care systems in New York and elsewhere filed a federal class-action lawsuit today to force an overhaul of Tennessee's foster care system.</p>
        <p>The suit says thousands of Tennessee children are languishing in foster care, in violation of federal law, neither being returned to their parents nor being made available for adoption. Many are kept in emergency shelters for months, the suit says, and some 2,000 children have been moved from home to home 10 or more times. The complaint also says no concerted effort is being made to find adoptive parents for many of the children.</p>
        <p>Marcia Robinson Lowry, executive director of the group, Children's Rights, said the Tennessee Department of Children's Services was ''a grossly mismanaged and overburdened child welfare system.''</p>
        <p>The suit, filed in Federal District Court in Nashville on behalf of eight juvenile plaintiffs whom it named as well as all of the more than 10,000 foster children in Tennessee, asks the court to find the state in violation of federal laws, including the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, which limits the time a state can hold children in foster care without either making them available for adoption or reuniting them with their parents.</p>
        <p>Children's Rights is asking the court to order the state to begin negotiations with the group on how the system should be overhauled.</p>
        <p>The suit also says the problems it outlines are even more acute for African-American children, and asks for additional relief for them.</p>
        <p>Gov. Don Sundquist, a Republican who was named as a defendant along with the state's children's services commissioner, George Hattaway, would not comment on the suit. But the governor's spokeswoman, Beth Fortune, said, ''This administration has made many efforts to improve the foster care system in Tennessee.''</p>
        <p>Ava Philson, a spokeswoman for the Department of Children's Services, said the agency had responded over the years to complaints about the system.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Ms. Philson said, the Legislature approved $19 million in extra money that helped the department hire more case managers and case workers. She said 36 additional lawyers were hired, almost tripling the number who represent children in efforts either to reunite them with their parents or have them adopted.</p>
        <p>In January 1999, Ms. Philson said, the department hired the Child Welfare League of America to assess the program and develop ways to change it. She also said the department installed a computer system last fall to allow case managers to better track children in the system.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lowry said these efforts were not enough. ''Given how long the state has known about the very serious problems and ongoing harm to children,'' she said, ''these efforts are really too little too late.''</p>
        <p>Children's Rights is involved in litigation or settlement talks with nine other state or city child welfare systems. A suit by the group led to a court order that put the foster care system in Washington, D.C., under court receivership. In New York City, a December 1998 settlement of a Children's Rights suit established an expert panel that evaluates and monitors the system.</p>
        <p>But some advocates for foster children said they believe that the kind of large class-action suits that Children's Rights brings are not the answer, either.</p>
        <p>''Nobody's saying there are not problems in these foster care systems,'' said Doug Lasdon, executive director of the Urban Justice Center in New York, ''but a humongous, global lawsuit that does not present concrete remedies is unlikely to change the system.''</p>
        <p>Dean Hill Rivkin, a professor of public interest law at the University of Tennessee here, said the suit was ''the first legal challenge to the state's foster care system as a whole,'' and called it ''long overdue.''</p>
        <p>According to the complaint, Brian A., the first plaintiff in the suit, is a 9-year-old who has been in foster care for four years and has been living in an emergency shelter near Memphis for the last seven months.</p>
        <p>Denise E., 8, who the suit says was placed in foster care after being removed at birth from her mother, was visited once by a case manager during her first week of life, but never since then, and has not received any services to monitor her care, needs or development.</p>
        <p>Pseudonyms were used for the eight named plaintiffs.</p>
        <p>''The stories in the lawsuit are emblematic of the problems across the state,'' Professor Rivkin said.</p>
