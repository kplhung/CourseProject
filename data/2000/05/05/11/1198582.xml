        <p>A top Wisconsin official has ordered an independent audit of Maximus Inc. after the welfare-to-work contractor acknowledged that five of its employees and consultants incorrectly billed Wisconsin for work in helping the company pursue contracts in New York and other cities.</p>
        <p>Linda Stewart, secretary of Wisconsin's Department of Workforce Development, said this week that she would hire an outside auditing firm to conduct ''a thorough review'' of the billing practices at the company's operations there.</p>
        <p>Maximus, based in McLean, Va., is the nation's largest private operator of programs that help welfare recipients find jobs. It has held nearly $90 million in contracts in Wisconsin since 1997. It also won more than $100 million in contracts in New York.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stewart said she decided that the audit was necessary after Maximus informed her that four employees had billed the Wisconsin program for 272 hours of work elsewhere in the country. Maximus officials said those wages totaled $7,647. In addition, they said, one consultant, Tony A. Kearney, billed Wisconsin $1,400 for a trip to New York in 1999.</p>
        <p>A Maximus vice president, Jerry Stepaniak, told Ms. Stewart in a letter that the company would reimburse Wisconsin for the improper labor bills, which he described as ''unintended errors.'' The company said it already had reimbursed Wisconsin for Mr. Kearney's trip.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stepaniak's letter also supplied new information about the company's efforts to win the New York contracts with the help of 15 of its Wisconsin employees. Maximus officials said that about two-thirds of the 272 hours that were incorrectly billed to Wisconsin covered work done to prepare for the New York bidding, while the other third related to bids made in San Diego and Arizona.</p>
        <p>New York's welfare commissioner, Jason A. Turner, created the welfare-to-work program when he was a state official in Wisconsin, and Maximus later hired Mr. Turner's father-in-law while it was seeking the New York contracts.</p>
        <p>City auditors and investigators in New York have been trying to determine what Mr. Kearney, a longtime friend of Mr. Turner's, did while working as a Maximus consultant last year.</p>
        <p>Company officials have said they expected the New York welfare agency to pay Maximus $100,000 for this work, but they said they never received any of that money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stepaniak's letter said Mr. Kearney's pay for this work came out of company billing accounts designated for New York.</p>
        <p>But a chart included with his letter showed that Maximus also paid Mr. Kearney $172,911 as a job-training consultant in Wisconsin from July 1998 until March 2000. The chart showed that about $68,000 of those payments were made after May 1, 1999, when Mr. Kearney began spending much of his time in New York City, suggesting that he was dividing his time between the two cities.</p>
