        <p>Derek Jeter tried to steal the karma off Jorge Posada's back Tuesday night when he greeted the American League's third-best hitter (.376) at home plate.</p>
        <p>Posada had hit the game-tying home run in the seventh, and there was Jeter, rubbing his hands up and down the catcher's jersey in admiration, if not in mock desperation. Earlier that day, Jeter had deposited his bats in Posada's locker, a vault of gold recently.</p>
        <p>The bats, however, were untouched by his teammate's success. Jeter went hitless for his third straight game, which the Yankees won by 4-3 in 10 innings against Tampa Bay. So Jeter brought them back to his side of the Yankee clubhouse yesterday afternoon. ''Didn't work,'' Jeter said.</p>
        <p>Going into tonight's makeup game for last night's rainout against Tampa Bay, Jeter is 2 for 21 on the five-game homestand, with 5 hits in his last 32 at-bats.</p>
        <p>Slumps rarely appear for Jeter. He began last season reaching base safely in 53 straight games, and his average never went below .345; he is batting .268 now. It has been three years -- April 24 through April 26 -- since Jeter last went three games without a hit.</p>
        <p>''Really? Well I hope it's not, four,'' Jeter joked, relaxed in his locker yesterday. His mood has not followed his average.</p>
        <p>He added: ''That's three games, we have 162; it's still so early in the season. It'll come, whether it's today, whether it's tomorrow, whether it's next week. Every player goes through zones.''</p>
        <p>Get a couple of hits, he says, and the average immediately shoots up and everybody forgets. A couple of hits would be a bonanza right now.</p>
        <p>Monday night, Jeter hit a ball sharply toward left field. It ricocheted off third baseman Vinny Castilla and shortstop Kevin Stocker collected it and threw him out.</p>
        <p>''That's when you know things aren't going your way,'' Jeter said.</p>
        <p>Tuesday night in the bottom of the 10th inning, when the Yankees had two outs and two men on, the Devil Rays decided to walk Jeter intentionally. ''In my head I was like, 'There's no way I can get out this time,' '' Jeter said. ''The law of averages have to be on your side sometime.''</p>
        <p>That law has been rewarding him at the end of most seasons. For a player who set career marks in nearly every offensive category last year, his .349 batting average was second best in the American League, such a drought is more than unusual. ''It's very odd,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said. ''We just haven't seen that in a couple years, anyway.''</p>
        <p>But Torre is not seeing Jeter grouse about it. ''He's the same guy, he looks at it in a way that's not dark,'' Torre said. ''He knows it's going to end. Sure he's frustrated, but he knows he's going to be O.K. He still has a good frame of mind, even though he's a little antsy.''</p>
        <p>Jeter shrugged. ''You've got to keep the same attitude, whether you're up or down,'' he said. ''Every year you go through something like this -- I don't care who you are. To be honest, I don't really think about it.''</p>
        <p>But Dorothy Jeter does.</p>
        <p>''My mom has been on me,'' Jeter laughed. ''She's been in the stands telling me to swing at good pitches and get some hits.''</p>
        <p>Apparently she sees what Torre has been seeing. ''He's not being selective,'' Torre said. ''He's opening up, and his head follows.'' Players in a slump, Torre added, often seem afraid to get behind the pitcher because it puts them on the defensive even more.</p>
        <p>Still, Torre has not considered sitting his shortstop. ''No, that would be counterproductive,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Jeter agreed, adding: ''Right now, I just need more at-bats. You just keep swinging, when you're not comfortable, you just try to find a comfort zone.''</p>
        <p>Count the hitting coach Chris Chambliss as among those who are not worried. ''This kid can start hitting in a heartbeat,'' Chambliss said. ''He's just a little overaggressive, he just has to sit back.''</p>
        <p>Torre has been touching his front shoulder, signaling to Jeter during an at-bat to lay back on pitches. But translating that at the plate is different. ''You don't want to listen to anything when it's going bad,'' Posada offered. ''No one can help you.''</p>
        <p>Not even a mother. Dorothy's words are direct: ''Just see it, hit it,'' Derek Jeter said, then added with a laugh. ''Usually her advice works.''</p>
