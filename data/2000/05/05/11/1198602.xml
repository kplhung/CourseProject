        <p>Dozens of students picked up caps and gowns at Providence College on a sun-drenched afternoon last week, while others flipped a Frisbee across a lawn. But as students scurried to classes and prepared for final exams, an ugly incident hovered over this small Catholic school, tarnishing the otherwise idyllic end-of-semester scenes.</p>
        <p>Eight basketball players were involved in a brutal fight with three other Providence students one evening last month that left two students lying bloodied on the ground and in need of reconstructive facial surgery, according to the police.</p>
        <p>The incident has angered many of the 3,700 Providence students and disappointed administrators, and it also threatens to decimate a once-proud basketball program that twice has been to the Final Four. The Providence Friars have been a primary source of pride, inspiration and entertainment for people in this area for half a century, but they are scrambling right now just to find enough players to fill next season's roster.</p>
        <p>As many as six players, at least three of whom were projected to be starters, could be lost from next season's team as a result of the fight. Much will depend on the outcome of criminal cases and college disciplinary proceedings.</p>
        <p>Four of the basketball players have been charged with assault for their roles in the fight. Those players, along with the four others, have already been punished by a college discipline committee; each of the eight players was expelled, suspended or placed on disciplinary probation. School officials declined to discuss details of the punishment.</p>
        <p>The eight players have appealed the discipline committee's findings, and they remain on campus to take final exams this week and await the completion of their appeals, which is expected soon.</p>
        <p>If the penalties are upheld, none of the players would be eligible to play here next season. Six of the eight had intended to return, but even students on probation are not permitted to play on a Providence College team.</p>
        <p>And since Providence has a recent history of enforcing strict penalties against other students found to have violated college rules, two people familiar with the appeals process said it appeared unlikely that the penalties would be reduced.</p>
        <p>If they are not, the basketball coach, Tim Welsh, might have only four scholarship players returning from a listless 11-19 team. But Welsh is trying to be optimistic in the midst of the embarrassing ordeal. ''Providence College basketball has been around for many, many years,'' Welsh said. ''This was an unfortunate incident. We all have to learn from it and move forward. But the program is not going to go under because of something that happened in 10 minutes.''</p>
        <p>The fight took place on a chilly Monday evening, April 10, after the players had gone to the apartment of Thomas Cook, a senior, at 47 Eaton Street, just a few hundred feet off campus. Cook works as a bouncer at Prime Time Cafe, a brick-faced bar about a mile off campus, where lines of students wait to get in on many nights.</p>
        <p>Cook had helped remove David Murray, a 6-foot-9-inch center from New York City, from Prime Time three days earlier, because Murray, 22, did not have valid identification, said Maj. Martin F. Hames, chief of detectives for the city police. Some shoving occurred as Murray was forced to leave the bar, Hames said.</p>
        <p>Several players spent the weekend trying to find Cook, Hames said, to confront him about what they considered a lack of respect. The players arrived at the tan-and-white three-story house where Cook lives at about 10:30 P.M. The police said that Murray and two other basketball players -- Donta Wade and Llewellyn Cole -- punched and kicked Cook. He was found in the driveway disoriented, and he had surgery to repair a fractured jaw and a broken nose.</p>
        <p>Wade was also charged with hitting Mark Hogan, another Providence student. He needed surgery to repair injuries to his cheekbone and his eye socket and a metal plate had to be inserted in his face, the police said.</p>
        <p>A fourth player, Jamaal Camah, was charged with punching another college student who lives at the house, Ryan Kerwin.</p>
        <p>Although the players are all African-American and the injured students are white, many students and others with ties to the college insisted that the incident was not racially motivated.</p>
        <p>Murray, Wade and Cole have been charged with multiple counts of felony assault, assault with a deadly weapon and conspiracy to commit felony assault. The deadly weapons were the shoes apparently used to kick the injured students. The fourth player, Camah, was charged with one count of assault. They all pleaded not guilty.</p>
        <p>Cole, a 6-foot-7-inch forward from New York City, was the only senior on the team and will obviously not be back. But the other three are juniors who had been expected to start for the Friars next season: Wade, a 6-2 guard who had a 38-point game against Notre Dame last season; Murray, the 6-9 center; and Camah, a 6-4 guard.</p>
        <p>John C. Revens Jr., who is Cole's lawyer, and Daniel McKinnon, Murray's lawyer, disputed the police's version of the events, although each declined to offer specifics.</p>
        <p>A friend of the players said they had gone to Cook's house to retrieve a gold necklace that Murray had lost in the jostling with Cook at Prime Time on April 7. Murray had not been allowed into the bar, the friend said, because he did not have an ID, but he had somehow slipped inside. Cook helped to eject him and, in the pushing that took place outside the bar, Murray apparently lost a necklace, the friend said.</p>
        <p>When Murray and seven teammates went to Cook's house three days later to retrieve the necklace, the players were told that Cook was not home, the friend said. They were walking the short distance back to the campus when Cook and several other students confronted them. Both sides started arguing, the friend said, and Wade and Cook wound up squaring off, beginning the skirmish that left Cook and Hogan seriously injured and the basketball program in shambles.</p>
        <p>''There was a fight,'' Revens, Cole's lawyer, said. ''There's no dispute about that. As to where the fight occurred and how it occurred, there will be a dispute about that.''</p>
        <p>McKinnon, Murray's lawyer, said the fight was ''substantially more complicated'' than has been reported by the authorities.</p>
        <p>''The people who might appear, at first blush, to be the aggressors might prove to be the people who started to retreat,'' he said.</p>
        <p>While Providence College has not released the names of the players involved in the fight because of federal privacy laws, Wade, Cole, Murray and Camah were arraigned in District Court on April 14. A Big East Conference official confirmed that the other four students who accompanied them to Eaton Street are also basketball players.</p>
        <p>College officials declined requests for interviews, and some students involved in the incident did not respond to interview requests.</p>
        <p>''We've been extremely careful about not saying anything until the appeal process is completed,'' said Edward J. Caron, the vice president for college relations and planning.</p>
        <p>Welsh, a former Iona coach who just finished the second year of a seven-year contract, might be left with only the remnants of a team that was one of the worst in the Big East last season.</p>
        <p>Welsh said he would meet with students, alumni and fans for ''20 hours a day,'' if necessary, to restore faith in the program, but the 39-year-old coach and the team are obviously in a dire situation.</p>
        <p>The Friars appeared in the Final Four in 1973, when Ernie DiGregorio was making fancy passes to Marvin Barnes, and in 1987, when Rick Pitino was climbing to coaching prominence with a future coach on the court named Billy Donovan. The school boasts of former players like Lenny Wilkens and John Thompson and former coaches like Joe Mullaney and Dave Gavitt.</p>
        <p>While many Providence students were reluctant to discuss the fight and the basketball players, some were outspoken. ''It's a ridiculous situation,'' said David Tanski, a freshman. ''They should be kicked out of school and put in jail.''</p>
        <p>Even Welsh said, ''If certain people need to be penalized, they will be.''</p>
        <p>Brian Burke, another freshman, said: ''The glory days of Providence basketball are behind us. That's why I think they should just get rid of these kids and start fresh. Maybe they can make it back. They've done it before. You can do it easier these days. You only need a couple of kids.''</p>
        <p>Actually, Welsh might need more than that just to hold a scrimmage. Since Providence could have as few as four returning players to go along with four high school recruits, Welsh is pursuing several junior college players and preparing for the worst.</p>
        <p>''I'm more determined than ever,'' he said. ''We're faced with this and now we have to figure a way out. It's not something I'm just saying to you, I truly believe it. It's not like we're coming off a Final Four year. I like the kids coming back. I'm not saying it's going to be a great time.''</p>
        <p>Some students speculated that because the players were used to receiving preferential treatment, from having full scholarships to getting early choices in classes and dormitories, they responded aggressively when something went against them.</p>
        <p>But another student noted that the players are taught teamwork throughout their careers and perhaps followed that approach while trying to help a teammate. ''It's good to be a good teammate and take care of each other,'' said Joe Valenzano, the former sports editor of The Cowl, the student newspaper. ''It's not good to go out and hunt people down.''</p>
        <p>One senior who spoke on the condition of anonymity said he loved Providence, but the school must remind everyone that violence will not be tolerated. He held a graduation cap that had ''Done With College'' etched across it. Those words, usually associated with celebrating a significant achievement, could have a different meaning for some basketball players at Providence this spring.</p>
