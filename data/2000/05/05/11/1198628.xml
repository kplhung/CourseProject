        <p>The Federal Trade Commission announced a settlement of an antitrust case against the nation's five largest music companies today that the commission said should result in significant price cuts for compact discs.</p>
        <p>Officials said the settlement completed a two-year investigation that found the companies used illegal marketing agreements to end a price war, inflate the prices of compact discs and sharply restrict the ability of retailers to offer discounts. The officials estimated that consumers were overcharged by $500 million over the last four years.</p>
        <p>In the settlement, which levied no fines, the companies agreed not to make any such marketing agreements.</p>
        <p>Robert Pitofsky, the F.T.C.'s chairman, said the settlement would enable retailers to advertise deep discounts once again. He estimated that the savings to consumers could be as high as $17 million a month, or roughly $2 to $5 on many popular discs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pitofsky said he had based the estimates on the heavy discounting and price wars that took place before the music producers wrote the marketing agreements in the mid-1990's.</p>
        <p>The marketing agreements, which the F.T.C. said violated federal antitrust law, were between many large and small retailers and the five music companies, which control 85 percent of the $15 billion CD market.</p>
        <p>The companies that settled the case were Time Warner, which announced earlier this year that it had reached a deal with the F.T.C.; the Sony Corporation of America; the Bertelsmann Music Group; EMI Music Distribution, and Universal Music and Video Distribution. All the companies have denied that the marketing agreements violated the law, and many of them declined today to discuss the settlement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pitofsky said the agreements, known as ''minimum advertised price'' programs, or MAP, were carried out in an effort by the manufacturers to end a price war earlier in the 1990's by such discounters as Circuit City, Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Target.</p>
        <p>The agreements between the music companies and the retailers forbade the retailers to advertise discounts on CD's in newspapers, on television or even on posters in the stores themselves. In exchange for those commitments, the music companies agreed to pay some or all of the advertising costs for the CD's.</p>
        <p>After initial agreements failed to curtail the price war, Mr. Pitofsky said, the music companies toughened the agreements. The new deals prohibited retailers from advertising discount prices even in ads that the retailers paid for. Mr. Pitofsky said the agency had discovered a memorandum sent by one industry executive describing the more restrictive program as ''MAP with teeth.''</p>
        <p>Commission officials said that in the few instances in which the retailers violated the agreements and advertised discounts, the manufacturers temporarily stopped making promotional payments, costing the retailers hundreds of thousands of dollars or more.</p>
        <p>''This was industry-wide vertical price-fixing,'' Mr. Pitofsky said at a news conference, adding that the case was a classic illustration of the differences in antitrust enforcement between the Clinton administration and the Reagan administration in the 1980's, when officials had a different view of antitrust law. ''During the 1980's, retail price maintenance agreements were not challenged once,'' Mr. Pitofsky said.</p>
        <p>A lawyer representing one of the companies said that the government had not presented a fair or complete picture of the marketing deal.</p>
        <p>The lawyer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that many music stores had wanted the marketing agreements because the pacts stopped the discount stores from undercutting the music stores by using CD's as a loss leader to attract customers. According to industry analysts, many music stores were driven into bankruptcy because of the earlier intense competition on CD prices. ''The specialty stores were being very badly hurt,'' the lawyer said. ''These agreements were intended to assist those specialty stores maintain a wide selection of offerings, and as such, they were actually very pro-consumer.''</p>
        <p>The lawyer said the companies had decided to settle the case because the marketing agreements were becoming outdated since they were not applicable to sales of CD's on the Internet, where CD sales have been growing steadily.</p>
        <p>Other executives from the music companies said their profit margins were the same regardless of the wholesale prices charged by the retailers and therefore they would not have gained any money by curtailing discounting. But government officials disputed that contention, saying that the manufacturers stood to gain substantially from helping the specialty stores.</p>
        <p>The consent order settling the investigation was approved today by a 5-to-0 vote of the F.T.C. The order prohibits the five companies from linking any future financing of advertising with pricing of CD's for seven years. For 13 years after that, the companies are prohibited from imposing pricing conditions in advertisements that are paid for by the retailers.</p>
        <p>Government officials said that although they had concluded that the agreements were unreasonable restraints of trade in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, they had decided not to seek fines. A variety of private lawsuits are seeking financial penalties against the five music companies.</p>
        <p>The officials said the investigation into the marketing agreements had had no bearing on the agency's review of a variety of industry-related mergers. But some analysts said Time Warner and EMI nonetheless felt compelled to settle the case because of two deals involving them that are before the F.T.C.</p>
