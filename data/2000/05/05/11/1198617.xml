        <p>Giuliani and Hanover Talk About a Separation  Mayor Giuliani said he was seeking a separation from his wife, Donna Hanover, adding that as he battled prostate cancer he would need Judith Nathan, whom he describes as a ''very good'' friend, ''more now than maybe I did before.''

She also said she had withdrawn from the couple's public life several years ago ''because of his relationship with one staff member.'' An aide said she was referring to the mayor's former communications director, Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas.</p>
