        <p>The United States Army's inspector general has concluded that the service's highest-ranking woman was a victim of inappropriate sexual advances from another Army general, Defense Department officials said today.</p>
        <p>The inquiry substantiated the claim of the woman, Lt. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy, whose career is often cited as an example of the opportunities for women in uniform, that Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith touched her inappropriately and tried to kiss her in her office at the Pentagon in 1996, the officials said.</p>
        <p>The case, the first instance of a sexual harassment case lodged against one Army general by another, is a serious embarrassment for the Army, which like the other armed services has been roiled by sexual scandals.</p>
        <p>General Kennedy's complaint  proved explosive among senior Army officers and resulted in an  accusation of personal misconduct against her, later determined to be unfounded. The conclusions in the inspector general's report were first reported in The Washington Post.</p>
        <p>General Kennedy filed a formal complaint last August after the Army announced that General Smith had been appointed deputy inspector general. Officials said she was outraged, since the inspector general's office is responsible for investigating charges of sexual harassment, among other types of misconduct.</p>
        <p>When General Smith's promotion was announced, there was no indication in his personnel file that General Kennedy had ever complained about his behavior, officials said.</p>
        <p>General Smith, who never took over the post as deputy inspector general, is expected to be forced to retire soon. He is not expected to face a court-martial because Army officials do not consider that the incident merits prosecution, Pentagon officials said.</p>
        <p>Although General Kennedy, the Army's first woman to earn three stars, did not formally report the 1996 incident for nearly three years, investigators interviewed friends and peers she spoke to after the event to validate her accusation.</p>
        <p>An Army spokesman had no immediate comment on the results of the investigation.</p>
        <p>Officials said the disciplinary process against General Smith was far from over. The Army inspector general is preparing to send his findings to the Army's vice chief of staff, Gen. John Keane, who must then issue his own finding. General Smith then has a right to rebuttal before the vice chief makes his final report.</p>
        <p>General Smith, who could not be reached for comment tonight, joined the Army in 1966 and served three tours in Vietnam as a cavalry officer. In 1996, at the time he was accused of the inappropriate advance against General Kennedy, he was the manager of the Saudi Arabian National Guard Modernization Program, which provided training and equipment to Saudi forces.</p>
        <p>While the Army's inspector general, Lt. Gen. Michael W. Ackerman, has led the inquiry, the clash between two generals was deemed worthy of oversight by the Pentagon's inspector general, who may ultimately be called upon to determine any actions taken against General Smith.</p>
        <p>General Kennedy is one of only three women in the military who are three-star officers, out of a total of 116 officers who hold the rank in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.</p>
        <p>General Kennedy, who recently announced that she would retire later this year, had been deputy chief of staff for intelligence before her promotion to lieutenant general in May 1997. She joined the Army in 1969, after receiving a bachelor's degree in philosophy from what is now Rhodes College in Tennessee.</p>
        <p>She advanced in an institution that initially had a separate women's corps with limited opportunities for women. She eventually commanded  two military intelligence battalions, in Germany and Hawaii.</p>
        <p>She has refused to discuss publicly her allegations of sexual harassment. In interviews after her promotion to lieutenant general, however, she said she had experienced sexual harassment in her career. In an interview with ABC News in 1997, she said she had dealt with the incidents ''individually.''</p>
        <p>''I think the important thing about it is that early in my career, what I did was I dealt with it individually,'' she said. ''My approach was to turn it over to my boss. And I was very impressed with the way it was handled.''</p>
        <p>Recently, Pentagon officers have sought to portray the male-dominated military as more open to women while insisting that sexual harassment would never be tolerated.</p>
        <p>General Kennedy's case obviously undercut that impression, as did investigations of two other male generals who were demoted for having had adulterous affairs.</p>
