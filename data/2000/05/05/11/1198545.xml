        <p>SLEEP-DEPRIVED -- that's the disclaimer Stacy Schiff, who's won the Pulitzer for biography, throws over her interview. She spent five years on her book about the marriage of Vera Nabokov, but what's concerning her now is her own domestic life.</p>
        <p>The new baby is 2 weeks old and nursing, her 7-year-old daughter has a strep throat, the 8-year-old son's birthday party is coming up -- ever put together a child's birthday party? -- Ms. Schiff, a breakneck New York speed talker, is saying. Would you like to come over Saturday and take a shot? She doubts she'll make any sense.</p>

        <p>SLEEP-DEPRIVED -- that's the disclaimer Stacy Schiff, who's won the Pulitzer for biography, throws over her interview. She spent five years on her book about the marriage of Vera Nabokov, but what's concerning her now is her own domestic life.</p>
        <p>The new baby is 2 weeks old and nursing, her 7-year-old daughter has a strep throat, the 8-year-old son's birthday party is coming up -- ever put together a child's birthday party? -- Ms. Schiff, a breakneck New York speed talker, is saying. Would you like to come over Saturday and take a shot? She doubts she'll make any sense.</p>
        <p>Still, hit her with that annoying question after the nanny brings coffee into the living room with the piano and the old-money space: heck of an apartment, off Park, in the 60's. How many rooms? (Subtext: are you loaded? Ms. Schiff will protect herself pretty well.)</p>
        <p>''We have enough to lodge our children.''</p>
        <p>Oh, c'mon.</p>
        <p>''Half the people we know think we have too few bedrooms; half think we have too many bedrooms.''</p>
        <p>Then, finally, charming, for Ms. Schiff is very charming: ''Do we have to go into that?''</p>
        <p>You know the scene in ''The Princess Bride'' where two manic swordsmen go at each other, taking a breather once in a while to discuss technique? This is how it is when a reporter sits down with a biographer who is wary of giving it up.</p>
        <p>''Too boring.'' ''Truly boring.'' Those are the words Ms. Schiff, 39, uses when you look into certain parts of her life: the medical condition that compelled her to remain in bed for her latest pregnancy; her finances.</p>
        <p>She also interviews the interviewer and compares notes: how about the guilt-provoking pause -- that one work for you? Don't you just hate it when you have to go back because you've missed the big question?</p>
        <p>She is more forthcoming on Vera Nabokov, the wife of Vladimir Nabokov, who during their 52-year marriage served as her husband's agent, editor, secretary and chauffeur.</p>
        <p>Why did Ms. Schiff, who had previously written a biography of the French aviator and writer Antoine de Saint-Exupery, not write about the creative partner?</p>
        <p>''I thought that she was the creative one to some extent,'' Ms. Schiff says. ''I suppose my thesis was the minor player was going to be very revealing of the major player. I'm trying to remember if Mrs. Dostoyevsky said to Mrs. Tolstoy or it was the other way around that a person's character is never so much revealed as in his day-to-day life at home.''</p>
        <p>Here is what is interesting about Mrs. Schiff's life at home: the absence of a husband. She has one, Marc de La Bruyere, a real estate developer in Edmonton, Alberta. He spends, in what Ms. Schiff cheerfully calls her bizarre life, about 10 days a month in New York. In the summer and on school holidays, Ms. Schiff and the children join him in Canada.</p>
        <p>''I live here; he lives most of the time in Edmonton,'' Ms. Schiff says. ''You might want to ask why.''</p>
        <p>Well, yes.</p>
        <p>''You ever try to leave New York?'' Ms. Schiff says in an escalating comic riff. ''I did once. I lasted about a year.''</p>
        <p>Oh.</p>
        <p>''I always had these great excuses: My agent is five blocks away. The kids go to school here. It's very cold there. It's really dark, at the end of the world. Like the Arctic Circle.''</p>
        <p>TIME for the nanny to bring in the baby to nurse, and while we courteously avert our eyes, Ms. Schiff's background:</p>
        <p>Despite the swank apartment, she is not a member of the powerful and rich New York Schiff family. She comes from the small mill town of Adams, Mass. Her mother taught at North Adams State College, and her father owned a clothing store in the Berkshires. They were one of three Jewish families in the county. ''Looking back, I think it was just a little alienating,'' Ms. Schiff says. ''Why do you think I'm always writing about refugees, people out of sync?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Schiff describes herself as ''an obstreperous child.'' When her parents tried to get her into boarding schools, she intentionally fell asleep in the car and would not leave. Later, she graduated from Phillips Andover Academy, then Williams College. She came to New York and worked as a book editor. The next book project will be Ben Franklin, the Paris years.</p>
        <p>End of visit. A few hours later one realizes there is, in this interview, one of those awful enormous holes: the wife Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky has said that domestic life reveals character. What does Ms. Schiff's unconventional domestic life reveal?</p>
        <p>Ms. Schiff, phone in hand, nursing the newborn, takes a pass.</p>
        <p>''I'll let you do this one,'' she says. ''You could say I was ultra culpable; you could say I was the poor neglected party. I seem to be the poor neglected party. Marc is coming back -- did I mention that?''</p>
        <p>But meanwhile, not counting the nanny, she is alone with three young children, one of whom is a 2-week-old. ''Don't think that didn't get into the conversation,'' Ms. Schiff says. '' 'Darling, everyone has strep, and the one that doesn't have strep is 2 weeks old.' ''</p>
        <p>Character, Ms. Schiff. What does this reveal?</p>
        <p>''You could say you have two stubborn people here. You could say there is a certain resistance to giving up one's identity. Have you ever been married? Had that thing of someone calling you by a name not your own? It's unsettling. It's like a fictitious person.''</p>
