        <p>Congressional Democrats rallied today around a bill that would offer prescription drug benefits as part of the Medicare program, in contrast to the approach favored by Republicans, who want to subsidize private insurance to help pay such costs.</p>
        <p>Several dozen House and Senate Democrats joined in a display of unity at the White House, where they said they had agreed on a proposal to offer coverage of prescription drugs to all Medicare beneficiaries -- 39 million elderly or disabled people.</p>
        <p>The proposal is similar to one offered by President Clinton, but it is somewhat more generous to beneficiaries and somewhat more expensive for the government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton and lawmakers appeared in the White House Rose Garden with Betty Dizik, a 73-year-old widow who said she sometimes skipped prescribed medications for diabetes and a heart condition because she could not afford them.</p>
        <p>''I am not asking for a handout or for charity,'' Ms. Dizik said. ''I am willing to work and do my part. I am just asking for a little help.''</p>
        <p>The Democrats' proposal is embodied in a bill introduced today by the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, with 32 of the 45 Democratic senators as co-sponsors. The House Democratic leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, said he would soon introduce a bill nearly identical to the Senate measure.</p>
        <p>In a Congress controlled by Republicans, the Democrats have no chance of seeing their bills enacted. But they hope that by taking a unified position, they can put pressure on the Republicans to enter negotiations leading to the enactment of Medicare drug benefits this year.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore and many Congressional Democrats have denounced the Republicans as slow to act on the issue.</p>
        <p>But the president sounded more cooperative today. ''We all know we can't achieve our efforts without bipartisan support in the Congress,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''That's why, just as we are trying to do with the patient's bill of rights, we want to reach across the aisle to encourage Republican support, as well. This can and should be a truly bipartisan effort.''</p>
        <p>The Congressional Democrats, like Mr. Clinton, say Medicare should cover half of a person's drug expenses up to certain limits -- half of the first $2,000 in drug expenses starting in 2002. The ceiling would rise gradually. By 2009, Medicare would cover half of the first $5,000 in drug expenses.</p>
        <p>Some drugs cost much more than $5,000 a year. The Congressional Democrats would provide assistance for people with very high expenses; Medicare would pay their drug costs after they spent $3,000 or $4,000 of their own money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daschle said his bill ''dedicates $50 billion'' to insurance covering such catastrophic expenses from 2003 to 2010. By contrast, the president requested $35 billion for the years from 2006 to 2010.</p>
        <p>Republicans are developing their own proposals. The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, is drafting legislation but has not given any hint of the details. House Republicans are fleshing out their proposal, under which the government would subsidize private insurance to help pay drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
        <p>Congress and the administration are both scrutinizing drug prices. Federal officials said they were investigating several drug companies to see if they had overcharged Medicaid, Medicare or other government programs by overstating their wholesale prices.</p>
        <p>The American unit of Bayer A.G., the German drug company, said it had begun talks with the Justice Department in the hope of reaching a settlement over drug prices that would avoid costly litigation.</p>
        <p>In another sign of concern about drug costs, Senator James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont, introduced a bill that would make it easier for Americans to import medications from Canada, where drug prices are often much lower.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Jeffords's bill, Americans could import a limited amount of prescription drugs, perhaps a three-month supply, for personal use. In addition, pharmacists and wholesalers could import certain prescription drugs and pass the discounts on to American consumers.</p>
        <p>The drug industry opposes the bill, saying it could expose Americans to adulterated or counterfeit drugs. But the bill instructs the Department of Health and Human Services to regulate imports to ensure that drugs are safe and effective.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton and Congressional Republicans generally say that Medicare drug benefits should be enacted as part of a more comprehensive effort to revamp Medicare.</p>
        <p>Chris Jennings, the president's health policy coordinator, today commended the sponsors of an ambitious bipartisan proposal to redesign Medicare, Senators John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, and Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee. Mr. Jennings said the senators' efforts were ''quite encouraging.''</p>
