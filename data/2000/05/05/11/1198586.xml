        <p>In a Republican bid to woo the high-technology industry and please taxpayers, the House today rushed to the floor and then handily passed a bill to extend the current moratorium on new Internet taxes until 2006.</p>
        <p>The moratorium, which is due to expire in October 2001, forbids states to try to find new ways of taxing Internet use, like imposing taxes on monthly access charges for Internet service providers.</p>
        <p>The legislation passed today, which faces an uncertain future in the Senate, does not directly address the question of sales taxes; it would not stop states from trying to collect taxes for goods sold on the Internet.</p>
        <p>By failing to address sales taxes, however, the measure alarmed some traditional retailers, as well as state governments that say they have found it nearly impossible to collect taxes for goods sold online.</p>
        <p>''The single largest contributor to our economic prosperity has been the growth of information technology -- the Internet,'' said Representative John R. Kasich, an Ohio Republican. ''Why would we try to tax something, why would we try to abuse something, why would we try to limit something that generates unprecedented growth, wealth, opportunity and unprecedented individual power?''</p>
        <p>Critics of the bill say the moratorium, while seemingly benign, ignores the thorny question of how state and local governments can best collect taxes on the billions of dollars of merchandise sold over the Internet each year. These taxes are expected to provide a crucial future source of revenue for states, especially as more consumers buy goods online.</p>
        <p>The bill's opponents -- a consortium of retailers, small-business groups and governors -- say that consumers who buy merchandise over the Internet can easily circumvent the sales and ''use'' taxes that would be collected automatically if the same merchandise were bought at a bricks-and-mortar retail store.</p>
        <p>The National Governors' Association is working on the best way to collect electronic sales tax. Estimates have put the loss in sales tax revenue to the states at $8 billion a year by 2004.</p>
        <p>Retailers and small businesses have complained that the current system unfairly places at a disadvantage the traditional retailers that do not sell their wares online and must charge sales tax.</p>
        <p>''It's easy to imagine how these kinds of losses can affect state and local governments' ability to provide essential services,'' said Representative William D. Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat, citing the concerns of many governors. ''They will be compelled to cut back local services or raise income taxes or property taxes.''</p>
        <p>The bill even drew criticism from a few Republicans. Representative Ernest Istook of Oklahoma circulated a letter stating, ''The Internet should not be singled out to be taxed, nor to be freed from tax.''</p>
        <p>Still, the House voted overwhelmingly, 352 to 75, to pass the bill. A number of Democrats approved the measure after they received assurance that Congress would hold hearings concerning sales taxes and would try to come up with a solution.</p>
        <p>The moratorium ''has absolutely nothing to do with the sales tax -- we will have the opportunity to have that debate,'' said Representative Robert Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican.</p>
        <p>The House bill faces a murkier future in the Senate. Senator John McCain, chairman of the Commerce Committee, who advocates a permanent tax moratorium, canceled a hearing on the bill last month after Republican senators, some of them former governors, expressed reservations about extending the moratorium.</p>
        <p>The legislation also faces opposition from the Clinton administration, which signaled support today for a two-year moratorium. The full House today rejected a two-year extension in a separate vote.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee, has said he will support an extension of the moratorium. But the governor must tread carefully around the issue because Texas, which does not have a state income tax, would stand to lose substantial revenue if sales taxes are not made workable on the Internet.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Al Gore said the vice president supported a two-year extension of the moratorium ''at a minimum.'' If a five-year moratorium is put into place, ''it should include flexibility'' to adjust federal policies on Internet taxation ''to take into account the fast-paced change in the Internet world.''</p>
