        <p>'La Griselda'</p>
        <p>Teatro Instabile</p>
        <p>Cloister Theater, Riverside Church</p>
        <p>Teatro Instabile, a company planning to present small-scale opera now and then, made an encouraging debut on Sunday afternoon. Six excellent young singers were on show, with lively and highly musical support from an orchestra of soloists directed by Kenneth Cooper. The production was simple but thoroughly professional, and an interesting work was chosen: Vivaldi's ''La Griselda,'' in its American premiere.</p>
        <p>Even by the neglectful standards of Baroque opera, this piece treats its heroine with disturbing cruelty. Griselda is disowned by her husband (Gualtiero), whom she believes to have murdered their daughter (Costanza), is banished without her baby son, gets told by a suitor she rejects (Ottone) that he will kill this son, is brought back to court largely so that she can witness Gualtiero's second marriage and then has to smile and say nothing when, all in a few moments, the new bride is revealed to be her long-lost daughter, her son is restored to her, and Gualtiero calmly decides he will take her on again as his wife.</p>

        <p>Teatro Instabile, a company planning to present small-scale opera now and then, made an encouraging debut on Sunday afternoon. Six excellent young singers were on show, with lively and highly musical support from an orchestra of soloists directed by Kenneth Cooper. The production was simple but thoroughly professional, and an interesting work was chosen: Vivaldi's ''La Griselda,'' in its American premiere.</p>
        <p>Even by the neglectful standards of Baroque opera, this piece treats its heroine with disturbing cruelty. Griselda is disowned by her husband (Gualtiero), whom she believes to have murdered their daughter (Costanza), is banished without her baby son, gets told by a suitor she rejects (Ottone) that he will kill this son, is brought back to court largely so that she can witness Gualtiero's second marriage and then has to smile and say nothing when, all in a few moments, the new bride is revealed to be her long-lost daughter, her son is restored to her, and Gualtiero calmly decides he will take her on again as his wife.</p>
        <p>With so many ignominies justified only as opportunities for expressive arias, from tormentors and tormented, the scenario calls out for stylization. Maeve Fiona Butler, directing here, went the way of immediacy instead, with contemporary clothing that at least allowed the four women in male roles to look good onstage.</p>
        <p>Despite its all-female cast -- and its undercharacterized arias, for Vivaldi was no Handel -- the piece was kept various and vigorously alive by consistent enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>Shira Lissek, in the title role, sang warmly and with dignified pathos. Anna Tonna kept a bright but cool quality in her voice, a distance, that worked well for Gualterio's intense affectlessness. As Ottone, Sally Wilson displayed agility and an unusual incisive ring, and was impressive in one of the opera's high spots, a slow aria with obbligato oboe (Meg Owens). Stephanie Jensen-Moulton performed brilliantly and confidently as Costanza (as unappealing a character as her father), and Nita Baxani was sensitive and appealing as her faithful beloved Roberto. Lucy Tucker Yates was very engaging as Corrado, a character who stands on the sidelines (a very good place to be here) but whose every contribution she made an event, musically pleasurable and dramatically present.</p>
