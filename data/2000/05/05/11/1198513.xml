        <p>ALTHOUGH Internet use has become associated more and more with social isolation, some researchers are finding that the opposite may be true.</p>
        <p>According to a study released on Wednesday by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, a research center in Washington, more than half of Internet users found that e-mail was strengthening their family ties. And Internet users in the study reported far more offline social contact than non-users. Women in particular said they found e-mail very useful in keeping in touch with friends and family.</p>
        <p>''It's clear that Internet users have a more robust social network than non-Internet users,'' said Lee Rainie, director of the project. ''There doesn't seem like there's any diminution of social networks because people are spending a lot of time online.''</p>
        <p>Internet users in the study were far more likely to report that they had a significant network of relatives and friends to call on in time of need. Nearly half of Internet users reported that they had a social network, but only 38 percent of non-users did. The more years respondents had been going online, the more likely they were to report that they had a social network.</p>
        <p>And although 8 percent of Internet users said they were socially isolated, far more non-users -- 18 percent -- reported that they had either no one or hardly anyone to turn to. On the subject of offline, real-world contact, nearly 75 percent of Internet users said they had visited family or friends the day before they were asked the question, but only 61 percent of non-Internet users said they had made such visits.</p>
        <p>The telephone survey was conducted from March 1 through March 31. Interviews were conducted with 3,533 adults, and 1,690 of those were Internet users. The sampling error was plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for the full sample, and plus or minus 3 percentage points for data about the Internet users.</p>
        <p>These conclusions seem to contradict the findings of a study released in February by the Stanford Institute for the Quantitative Study of Society, but the studies took very different approaches.</p>
        <p>In that study, the researcher, Prof. Norman Nie, concluded that the Internet contributed to social alienation. Because people were spending more time on the Internet, his findings showed, they were spending less time in social endeavors. The study found that 8 percent of regular Internet users attended fewer social events and that 59 percent of regular users said they watched less television as a result of time spent online. Thirteen percent said they spent less time with friends and family.</p>
        <p>For the Stanford study, subjects were asked how much time they spent on various activities, including time online, but were not asked how they felt about their online communication. The Pew study asked about the quality of their online communication and whether subjects felt that it had improved their relationships, but the study did not ask how much time they spent on activities online and offline.</p>
        <p>''We are measuring communication and contact among people, e-mail being an important component of that communication and connection,'' said Mr. Rainie, director of the Pew study. The Stanford study's conclusions, he said, were based on ''a value judgment that any kind of conversational contact was more socially valuable than other types of contact.'' The study distinguished between e-mail, telephone conversations and face-to-face visits.</p>
        <p>Professor Nie, the researcher on the Stanford study, said that if he had to do it over, he would ask how people felt about the quality of their Internet communication. However, he said, ''that's not something survey research is particularly good at.'' Such questions would be more appropriate for a psychologist's couch, he said.</p>
        <p>He said he was convinced that e-mail communication was not as valuable as face-to-face interaction. For example, he said, some of his relatives had recently sent e-mail from every port while touring the world on a sailboat.</p>
        <p>''It was wonderful to hear about their exciting tales,'' Professor Nie said, ''but it had none of the emotional quality of spending an evening with them.''</p>
        <p>The different conclusions of the studies could signal the beginning of a stream of seemingly contradictory studies about the Internet. Bruce Bimber, director of the Center for Information Technology and Society at the University of California at Santa Barbara, said the contrast between the two studies showed that the Internet had become too diverse to examine as a singular phenomenon.</p>
        <p>Researchers discovered the same thing about television in past years. Though studies of television viewing showed that the audience was less engaged in society, those who watched public television were more engaged. The same may be true for segments of the Internet-using population, he said.</p>
        <p>''We have to stop thinking about the Internet as a single entity with a single effect,'' Professor Bimber said. ''It's going to take several more years before the research has a standard set of measures. Before we do that, we're going to get pieces of the puzzle that don't necessarily fit together but aren't contradictory.''</p>
        <p>The Pew study produced separate data for men and women with some clear differences. The study reported that about nine million women had gone online for the first time in the last six months, a number that comprises about one-tenth of all women in the United States. For the first time, women make up half the Internet population.</p>
        <p>Women, the study found, are more likely than men to say that e-mail has improved relationships with family and friends. Nearly 60 percent of women said they found e-mail very useful for communicating with family members, but only 44 percent of men said so.</p>
        <p>The study showed little evidence that time on the Internet prevents people from communicating in other ways. For example, parents and children who exchange e-mail said they talked on the phone just as often. More than 75 percent said they talked on the phone at least once a week and sent e-mail just as much.</p>
        <p>They did not deride the use of e-mail.</p>
        <p>''We're asking people to judge the value of that contact, and they're reporting that they value that contact,'' Mr. Rainie said. ''They felt there were improvements and a greater volume of communication. You can make the case that that's a social benefit.''</p>
