        <p>In a sign of possible turmoil in a highly sensitive criminal case, the Department of Justice has decided to replace at a critical moment the top prosecutor in its case against a scientist charged with mishandling nuclear weapon secrets at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>
        <p>Patricia Chavez, a spokesman for the United States attorney's office in Albuquerque, where the case is being handled, said the department had decided to send from Washington a prosecutor to take control of the case from Bob Gorence, the locally based assistant United States attorney who had been in charge.</p>
        <p>Ms. Chavez said Mr. Gorence, an experienced prosecutor who has pursued the case aggressively from its start last year, would remain ''a key member of the team'' handling the case against Wen Ho Lee, who was charged with illegally downloading top secret data on nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>Seven of the computer tapes on which Mr. Lee downloaded the data have disappeared, and the government has charged that he intended to provide the information to a foreign government, China.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee has vigorously denied the charges and has said he believes he was unfairly singled out for prosecution because he is Chinese-American.  Asian-Americans have come together to offer support, and have contended that he is a victim of racial discrimination. Although Mr. Lee has not been charged with espionage, he is being held under tight security and was twice denied bail.</p>
        <p>The change in prosecutors is surprising, in part, because it comes at a particularly sensitive time, when the defense and the government are expected to battle over how much nuclear weapon information can be submitted in the trial. The timing of this move heartened the defense.</p>
        <p>''This is good news for Dr. Lee, as Mr. Gorence was an experienced prosecutor,'' said Mark Holscher, one of Mr. Lee's lawyers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gorence would not comment.</p>
        <p>The trial is not scheduled until November, but the defense has already filed motions to introduce at trial all of the information Mr. Lee is said to have downloaded, and the request is expected to be argued in court in the next couple of months. This could be the pivot around which the outcome of the trial turns, and it now might be handled by someone relatively new to a case that involves abstruse issues of nuclear technology as well as national security.</p>
        <p>If the judge rules that the information should be admitted, the government must decide whether to comply. The government has already argued that the information contains ''the crown jewels'' of the American nuclear arsenal and that releasing it would compromise the country's national security. But if it refused, it would probably have to drop the charges against Mr. Lee.</p>
        <p>If the judge rejects Mr. Lee's request, it could weaken his defense, which his lawyers have said rests on his claims that most of the data was already in the public realm, that by itself it was not enough to design a bomb and that it was not that useful without a variety of manuals and other tools not generally available.</p>
        <p>It was unclear whether Mr. Gorence would remain with the United States attorney's office at this point. But the defense lawyers made it clear that they would not tolerate any delays in the proceedings, and that they would settle for nothing less than the ability to use at his trial all the data Mr. Lee is accused of illegally downloading.</p>
