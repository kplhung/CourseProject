        <p>Isn't It Grand?  If anyone was thinking that Georges Bizet's output was limited to ''Carmen'' or that opera is no laughing matter, the weekend gives pause. At 2 p.m. on Sunday, the 92nd Street Y offers a Bizet rarity, ''Doctor Miracle,'' performed by the St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble. Intended for families and children from 7 up, the one-act ''Miracle,'' a high comedy about an omelet, was Bizet's second opera. For those who like their opera with a grain of salt, La Gran Scena Opera Company, billed as the world's only all-male opera troupe, offers ''Murder Most Melodious'' at 8 on Saturday night and 7 on Sunday night at Town Hall. Led by Madame Vera Galupe-Borszkh, the company will devote itself to operatic murders, attempted murders and scenes that are murder to sing.</p>

        <p>Urban Melody  New York, New York, it's a wonderful town, and songwriters have never been shy about celebrating the city, from the Bronx to the Battery, from Chelsea to Coney Island. So what more fitting place for an evening of cabaret called ''The City in Song'' than the Museum of the City of New York, where the current exhibition, ''New York: Songs of the City,'' features more than 50 pieces of lavishly illustrated sheet music and related materials that trace three centuries of urban life and history? Among those scheduled to perform their favorite songs of the city at 7:30 tonight are Julie Wilson, KT Sullivan, William Kinsolving, Alex Donner, Nanci Collyer, Garth Bardsley, Alix Korey and Julie Gold. The singers will be accompanied by David Lewis on piano.</p>
        <p>Memories  It's back to the heyday of the Sherman Billingsley's Stork Club at 6:30 tonight at the New-York Historical Society, where the glamorous nightspot will be the subject of ''Conversation,'' a discussion complementing the institution's ''Stork Club'' exhibition. Sharing memories of the club with the author and critic John Lahr, the evening's host, and Ralph Blumenthal, a reporter for The New York Times and author of the new book ''Stork Club,'' will be Mr. Billingsley's daughter, Shermane Joy Billingsley, as well as the actresses Celeste Holm and Sheila MacRae; Tommy Wendelken, the Stork Club's last maitre d'hotel; and Don Bader, its last band leader.</p>
        <p>Show Time  The 2,500 artists include Matisse, David Hockney, Warhol, Jeff Koons, Louise Bourgeois and Joseph Beuys. The prices range from $200 to $4 million. The time is tomorrow through Monday. The event is Art Chicago 2000 in Festival Hall on Navy Pier in Chicago, where 165,000 square feet will be devoted to an art exposition highlighting the offerings of 217 modern- and contemporary-art galleries from around the world. The works include paintings, sculptures, photographs, prints, drawings, videos, installations and mixed media.</p>
