      <block class="full_text">
        <p>WE were just a happy family, coexisting peacefully with our Rockland County neighbors, until the newcomer moved to town.</p>
        <p>It was big. It was green.</p>
        <p>It was a swing set, and it was ours.</p>
        <p>My husband and I had bought what we thought our energetic 2-year-old son needed: a ChildLife Play System, the same hunter green swing set owned by Bob Vila and endorsed by Katie Couric on NBC. The first swing set to enter the hallowed grounds of Colonial Williamsburg. The swing set on which Caroline Kennedy and John Jr. frolicked at the White House.</p>
        <p>At the store, we watched our son play on the climbing wall, spin around the fireman's pole and whiz down the rocket slide. We plunked down $5,000, certain it would build valuable leadership qualities.</p>
        <p>Installing it, we followed zoning board guidelines: at least 5 feet away from the property line and no more than 15 feet high. We found a spot bordered by dense brambles and reedy trees and stood back to admire our statuesque Firechief model, its green-and-white-striped canvas awning snapping in the breeze. The red rocket slide reminded us of azaleas in full bloom.</p>
        <p>Then came the knock on the door -- the new neighbors, with a dinner invitation. ''We'd like you to take a look at something,'' they said.</p>
        <p>That something was our swing set, and it was obstructing their bathroom view.</p>
        <p>''We thought you had built a small house back there,'' they said of those green stripes. ''And what about the fall, when the leaves fall off the trees,'' and the red slide glares against the snow?</p>
        <p>We tried to see it their way, from their window,  but all we could see was a row of shrubs and a corner of the awning peeking through the leaves.</p>
        <p>Could we relocate it? ''We like to think of your yard as an extension of ours,'' they said, suggesting that together our yards had been ruined.</p>
        <p>Used to be the American backyard was a no-brainer. The tree house, the rusty barbecue, even the above-ground swimming pool were as accepted as station wagons and newspaper routes. Those tangerine shutters across the street? The cluttered lawn at the corner? Such design lapses were a tradition, along with a tacit agreement among neighbors to gripe behind closed doors. A suburbanite's home was his castle, the property line a moat over which the most zealous soldier dare not travel.</p>
        <p>But these days, the backyard (as well as the side and front) is fair game for the self-appointed taste police. As suburban sprawl encroaches on open space, people are laying claim to what little free range remains, and that includes the view from their upstairs window. The ''not in my backyard'' creed, so deftly applied to public works, has been given a new kicker: ''and not in yours either.'' Even something seemingly innocuous can incite a War of the Roses.</p>
        <p>* Last month an Arizona man opened fire on his former homeowner association members, killing two and injuring three in what began as a feud over the pruning of his hedges (he liked them lush; the association, closely cropped).</p>
        <p>* Neighbors besieged a resident of Piedmont, Calif., after he replaced wood window frames with aluminum ones. The aluminum frames must go, the planning commission ruled, adding that a design review should have been conducted first. The angry homeowner appealed to the city council, which relented somewhat: he must have wood frames on those windows visible from the street. ''All those good windows thrown out, and for what reason -- none,'' John Tsoi, the homeowner, fumed over the phone recently. ''And the old ones back in. It was so distressful that I don't want to talk about it ever again.'' He hung up.</p>
        <p>* In one Virginia suburb, neighbors banded together to urge a newcomer to tone down her home's salmon exterior to something less ''aquatic.'' Afraid of legal action, she repainted -- but only the sides facing the street.</p>
        <p>Zoning board officials, lawyers and academics blame density, wealth and its correlating sense of entitlement, not to mention the American propensity to litigate, for the volatile atmosphere. They say the innate character of suburbs, particularly older ones, is threatening to give way to a homogeneous, ''white bread'' environment -- while sending zoning boards and planners scurrying to map out the new rules.</p>
        <p>''I consider this a very significant development in recent American culture,'' said John R. Stilgoe, a professor of landscape history at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. Aesthetic strictures have moved out of gated communities, ''spreading into ordinary suburbs, where people are confusing safety with control,'' he continued, adding, ''It's coming down to a gross insecurity on the part of many people to allow diversity next door.''</p>
        <p>''This is the kind of thing that starts to lead to trouble,'' Professor Stilgoe went on. In most cases, he said, towns are making decisions piecemeal, ''often not aware of what they're doing.''</p>
        <p>He said that ''by eliminating all questionable aesthetics, you're losing the character of a community.''</p>
        <p>Based on conversations with a dozen planning officials across the country, one thing became certain: at an escalating pace, zoning boards are scrapping their old ways and yielding to community pressure, often rewriting the rules to appease a public that demands control over what is visible not only from the street, but also from behind it. Following in the footsteps of community associations and historic districts, which have always curtailed the liberties of homeowners in exchange for maintaining property values, many boards are exerting an iron-fisted authority over issues that were once owners' sole domain, down to the knocker on the front door.</p>
        <p>''Trees have become a problem, occasionally playground equipment and fencing, and every now and then, paint color,'' said Kathy Barnard, the director of planning and zoning in Westport, Conn., ''things our zoning commission and regulations committee are probably going to be addressing in the near future.''</p>
        <p>Scarsdale, N.Y., is among the increasing number of communities that in recent years have established a sort of good neighbor visual policy. Swimming pools and tennis courts must be approved by the board of appeals, and neighbors within 200 feet of a homeowner must be notified of any intention to modify the backyard, ''so there are no surprises,'' said Adolph M. Orlando, the building inspector for Scarsdale. ''People are definitely less tolerant than they used to be,'' he added. ''People get upset when someone sneezes. As density increases everyone wants to feel like they're in their own private enclave. We don't regulate playground equipment. That's a little over the top.''</p>
        <p>In Piedmont, Lori Salamack, the city planner, conceded that the commission had been forced into ''re-reviewing, possibly rewriting guidelines to accommodate new materials,'' like aluminum siding, ''that weren't around 70 or 80 years ago.''</p>
        <p>In other communities, self-regulation is taking the place of zoning rules. In Washington, one family fended off constant complaints from a next-door neighbor during a renovation, even as the contractors lowered the noise level and shortened  work hours. When the job was done, the neighbor said the new copper roof was blinding her as she drank her morning coffee. ''I just told her, 'A lot of nice houses around here have roofs like that -- it will age,' '' the renovator said.</p>
        <p>In Pleasanton, Calif., the owner of an orchard -- thwarted by tree-loving locals who voted against his attempt to cut down nonproducing walnut trees and replace them with houses -- legally erected an eight-foot corrugated metal fence to block the view of the tree lovers.</p>
        <p>''They can sit and look at that steel fence,'' the orchard owner, Jim Merritt, told reporters in October. When neighbors in Nyack, N.Y., feuded over porch lights (40 watt vs. 60 watt) with guarantees of sleepless nights ahead, the zoning board told the parties to take it to court.</p>
        <p>''It's all about respecting your neighbors' enjoyment of their own property,'' said John Allgor, chief building and zoning inspector in Nyack. ''Some things are a little excessive, because you have different personalities and different lifestyles. I think people just need to live with each other.''</p>
        <p>I tried that. And failed. A chill ensued between our two houses.</p>
        <p>Neighbors offered whispered condolences and fists raised in solidarity, but each time I ventured out my front door, I felt a scarlet P (for pariah) sign itself in sweat on my brow. ''Let it go,'' my husband suggested. I couldn't.</p>
        <p>Our neighbors had no recourse but to appeal to our good nature and weakening resolve.</p>
        <p>There was talk of trees, of ivy-covered lattices and ornamental plantings, of removing the swings and the slide for the winter months.</p>
        <p>We agreed to replace the green-and-white awning with solid green as a kind of peace offering, a retreat from the escalating war over the swing set. But the red slide stayed.</p>
        <p>Eight weeks and $200 later, however, I balked, and the more circumspect awning remained untouched on the dining room table. No one was about to tell me what to do with my property.</p>
        <p>In the words of Professor Stilgoe,  ''People's individual creativity is being nibbled to death by a bunch of order-loving mice!''</p>
        <p>''You should talk to a constitutional lawyer,'' he advised, referring me to his Harvard Law School colleague, the well-known criminal justice lawyer Alan M. Dershowitz, who is a First Amendment expert.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dershowitz said: ''It's a fascinating issue that arises in public and private spaces. When Frank Lloyd Wright built his houses, people found even them visually offensive. The legal answer is fairly clear. Communities have the right, within limits, to impose restrictions both in public and private places. Many cities have imposed aesthetic constraints to provide aesthetic continuity.''</p>
        <p>The good news: I had a First Amendment right to express myself, within limits. Mr. Dershowitz continued: ''But the right to swing your fist ends at the tip of my nose, and that's true artistically as well. Towns have the right to limit decibels, and they certainly have the right to limit visual assaults.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dershowitz said he had a neighbor on Martha's Vineyard with  a metal roof that reflected the sun's rays into his eyes when he was trying to work. ''I called him, and he promised he would paint it black,'' Mr. Dershowitz said. Well, what else was his neighbor to do? (Note to the neighbor of the copper roof in Washington: Mr. Dershowitz said that had he taken the case to court, he believes he would have won, comparing the roof to an enormous mirror.)</p>
        <p>''By the way,'' Mr. Dershowitz said, ''I don't think you need to worry about your swing set.'' If this went any further, I knew whom to hire.</p>
        <p>Then I noticed the neighbors' magenta shutters, which I never cared for but never would have asked them to repaint. How about that blue tarpaulin on the other side of their house? The red back porch light?</p>
        <p>I considered my beloved neighborhood, with its tidy homes and meticulously kempt yards and its idiosyncratic color scheme and decided this was a community well loved. Do I love every aspect of it? Definitely not. But its quirkiness is why I wanted to live here in the first place.</p>
        <p>My neighbors won't be hearing a peep out of me.</p>
