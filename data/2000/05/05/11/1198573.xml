        <p>The morning after Gov. George E. Pataki offered Nassau County a $100 million state bailout and help in refinancing its crushing debt load, county officials woke up today to a sobering thought: to get the help they must cut their budget by $260 million -- or more than 10 percent -- over the next four years.</p>

        <p>The morning after Gov. George E. Pataki offered Nassau County a $100 million state bailout and help in refinancing its crushing debt load, county officials woke up today to a sobering thought: to get the help they must cut their budget by $260 million -- or more than 10 percent -- over the next four years.</p>
        <p>In a sense, they were not all that far from where they were last week.</p>
        <p>''I don't consider the weight on my shoulders any lighter today than I did yesterday,'' said Judith A. Jacobs, the Democratic presiding officer of the County Legislature, who welcomed the aid but said the plan raised many questions as to how the county could cut $50 million this year and $70 million in each of the next three years.</p>
        <p>In announcing the plan on Tuesday, Governor Pataki said he hoped that if the promise of $100 million in state aid did not spur the county to make the cuts, the threat that the state would impose a financial control board to take over the county would. And he stressed that he did not believe that the county would have to raise taxes to fix its finances.</p>
        <p>But if the past is any guide, the cuts will not be easy. The county is still divided among a Republican county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta; the Democrats who control the Legislature; and Republican lawmakers.</p>
        <p>Officials here were optimistic about their ability to cut $50 million from this year's budget and $70 million more from next year's. But privately, some county officials of both parties expressed doubts about whether they could keep cutting spending in 2002 and 2003 without resorting to tax increases.</p>
        <p>One Democrat noted that if nothing else, the plan would keep the county from raising taxes this year, thus avoiding further embarrassment to the county's Republican Party -- which ruled Nassau during the years of its fiscal demise -- as it faces elections for the State Legislature, the United States Senate and the presidency.</p>
        <p>The state comptroller, H. Carl McCall, who applauded Governor Pataki for recognizing the scope of Nassau's fiscal problems, raised doubts about the plan, saying in a statement that ''the governor's rhetoric seems to say that the repairs can be accomplished easily, and this remains to be seen.''</p>
        <p>''The county executive will now be forced to do what historically he and the County Legislature have repeatedly failed to do in the past -- to make difficult decisions and to address the very serious fiscal issues that have been deferred for so long,'' Mr. McCall added.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Gulotta went to Albany to try to drum up support for the governor's plan among legislative leaders. For the plan to be enacted, it must win the approval of county officials and the State Legislature. Mr. Gulotta said that the plan was being greeted warmly in Albany, but that many lawmakers there wanted to see the details.</p>
        <p>As for the prospect of making the necessary cuts, he said, ''The more that we can cut this year, the less draconian will be the cuts that have to be made in the future.''</p>
        <p>Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader of the County Legislature, was also in Albany today, as Nassau Republicans gathered there for an annual party that they hold with state lawmakers. ''My optimism for the plan remains unchecked,'' Mr. Schmitt said. ''The cuts will be hard, they will be painful, but we'll just have to do it.''</p>
        <p>The county will almost surely have to request givebacks from its unions. One likely proposal is to have union members contribute to their health insurance plans. But the unions have so far resisted any efforts to tamper with their contracts.</p>
        <p>And until now the county has had little leverage, because after the unions agreed to defer some pay, the county guaranteed all of them except the one representing police officers that there would be no layoffs. The police union refused to go along with the pay deferral, and Mr. Gulotta has already proposed laying off more than 200 officers.</p>
        <p>But now, as the threat of a control board with the power to abrogate contracts looms, county officials hope the unions will be willing to negotiate.</p>
        <p>All in all, the county still has a tough road ahead. As Ms. Jacobs, the Democrat, said, ''The plan is not a panacea, and anyone who looks at it as the end of all our problems is deluding themselves.''</p>
