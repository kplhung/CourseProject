        <p>A group led by a former Coca-Cola benefits manager said today that it would press on with a boycott against the company despite a lack of support from major civil rights organizations.</p>
        <p>The former benefits manager, Larry Jones, said that his group, the Committee for Corporate Justice, which includes some former and current Coca-Cola employees, will ask  Atlanta businesses and churches to remove Coke vending machines and will distribute literature at local transit stations.</p>
        <p>The group is demanding that the company change what the group contends is discriminatory treatment of black employees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones, who is not among the plaintiffs in the suit, announced the boycott at the company's annual meeting in Wilmington, Del., on April 19; Coca-Cola says the action has not had a discernible impact.</p>
