        <p>For a company beleaguered by a federal antitrust investigation, Sotheby's pulled off a impressive sale of Impressionist and modern art last night.</p>
        <p>Its York Avenue salesroom was overflowing with collectors, dealers and curiosity seekers. The regulars came to watch as millions of dollars' worth of art by masters like Monet and Matisse, Picasso and van Gogh changed hands. But some in the audience were drawn by the publicity Sotheby's has received since the resignations of A. Alfred Taubman, its chairman and major stockholder, and Diana D. Brooks, its president and chief executive, in February. Sotheby's faces the possibility of steep fines and dozens of lawsuits alleging that the company colluded with its archrival Christie's to fix the prices it charges buyers and sellers.</p>
        <p>None of this affected the strong prices last night. The sale totaled $140.3 million, in the middle of its estimate of $117 million to $163 million. Of the 50 lots, only 8 went unsold.</p>
        <p>The sale had few star works and many offerings had recently been on the market, but that didn't stop buyers.</p>
        <p>Among the best works in the sale was ''The Portal (Sun),'' from Monet's series of views of the facade Rouen Cathedral. It had been on the market twice in the last 15 years: at Sotheby's in 1984, when it was sold for $2.5 million, and again in 1987, when it brought $3.1 million. Last night, four bidders wanted the sun-dappled scene. It finally went to an unidentified telephone bidder for $24.2 million, nicely above its estimate of $15 million to $20 million.</p>
        <p>(Final prices include Sotheby's commission, 20 percent of the first $15,000, 15 percent of the next $85,000 to $100,000, and 10 percent of any amount over $100,000. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)</p>
        <p>''The Serpentine,'' a rare Matisse sculpture that was up for sale last night, is from an edition of 10 plus one artist's proof. This piece was cast in 1948. But the artist executed it far earlier, around 1909.</p>
        <p>The first hand to go up was that of Maria-Gaetana Matisse, the widow of the gallery owner Pierre Matisse, one of the artist's sons. She was sitting with John Lumley, international director of Impressionist and post-Impressionist art at Christie's in London. But bidding went so fast that she quickly dropped out. Two tenacious telephone bidders fought for the sculpture, which ended up selling for $14 million, well above its high estimate of $10 million, and setting a record for a Matisse sculpture.</p>
        <p>That cast had not been on the market in 30 years, but many of last night's works had been up for sale in recent years. Picasso's ''Compote and Guitar,'' a 1932 still life that Sotheby's experts thought could fetch $10 million to $15 million, sold to another unidentified telephone bidder for $9.9 million, just below its low estimate. The price was hefty, considering that the painting sold for $3.8 million at Christie's eight years ago.</p>
        <p>Some works lost their value from the heady days of the 80's. A Renoir portrait, ''Portrait of Gabrielle (Young Girl With Flowers),'' circa 1900, for which a Japanese collector had paid $4.6 million in 1989 at the height of the art boom, was back on the market last night with an estimate of $900,000 to $1.2 million. It sold to an unidentified bidder for $1.1 million.</p>
        <p>Before the sale, David Norman, head of Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art department in New York, said last night's most asked-about work was Monet's ''Camille Sitting on the Beach at Trouville.'' (1870-71). Estimated at $1 million to $1.5 million, it had many determined takers and finally sold to an unidentified collector for $2.3 million.</p>
        <p>Beautifully painted, though difficult in subject matter, is Toulouse-Lautrec's ''Abandon, or the Two Friends'' (1895), depicting two women lying on a bed looking into each other's eyes. One of the best examples of the artist's preoccupation with female couples, it was expected to bring $6 million to $8 million. Seven bidders tried hard to buy the painting, which ended up selling to a telephone bidder for $9.3 million.</p>
        <p>An example of Monet's famous ''Waterlilies'' series, this one from 1908, was on offer after selling for $4.9 million at Christie's in 1995. Last night, it brought $8.3 million, right in the middle of its estimate of $7 million to $9 million. The price was strong, considering that Christie's had sold two paintings from the series on Monday night: a rare one from 1906 for $20.9 million and one from 1917-19 for $6.8 million.</p>
        <p>A van Gogh still life, ''Flowers in a Vase'' (1890), which had brought $4 million at Sotheby's sale of works from the Reader's Digest Collection in 1998, was back on the block with an ambitious estimate of $5 million to $7 million. It ended up selling for $4.6 million to an unidentified telephone bidder who beat out two other contenders.</p>
        <p>''Many of the top prices exceeded 1989,'' Mr. Norman said. ''But at the low end, that isn't always the case.''</p>
        <p>''Preparation for the Class'' (1882-85), a Degas scene of dancers in rehearsal, was estimated at $5 million to $7 million and brought $5.2 million. The pastel had been up for sale at Sotheby's twice in the last decade: in 1990 and in 1998, fetching $4.9 million both times.</p>
        <p>Many collectors and dealers were confused because all levels of the market seemed to find buyers last night, whereas earlier in the week, at Christie's sales of Impressionist and post-Impressionist art on Monday night and of 20th-century art on Tuesday evening, buyers were more selective.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes you think you know exactly where you are,'' said James Roundell, of the Dickinson-Roundell Gallery in New York and London. ''Then, suddenly, you don't.''</p>
