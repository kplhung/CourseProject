        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's marital problems exploded yesterday in a public exchange with his wife, Donna Hanover. The mayor abruptly announced that he was seeking a separation from Ms. Hanover, and Ms. Hanover, caught unaware, then said that the couple's troubles began years ago because of a previous relationship between the mayor and a member of his staff.</p>
        <p>At an extraordinary, emotional news conference in Bryant Park, Mr. Giuliani also said that as he battles prostate cancer he will turn ''more now than maybe I did before'' to Judith Nathan, the woman he describes as a very good friend.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani did not say whether he would continue his campaign for the Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton, but he did say that his political career was not his first concern.  Speculation about other candidates raced through the city last night, reflecting Republican fears that Mr. Giuliani would withdraw.</p>
        <p>''I don't really care about politics right now,'' Mr. Giuliani said. His  hands gripped the lectern tightly as he cast his eyes downward and spoke in a quiet, sad voice.</p>
        <p>''I'm thinking about my family, the people that I love and what can be done that's honest and truthful and that protects them the best,'' he said. ''I'm not thinking about politics. Politics comes at least second, maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else. It'll all work itself out some way politically.''</p>
        <p>Three hours later, Ms. Hanover appeared outside Gracie Mansion and, with a wavering voice and tears in her eyes, said: ''Today's turn of events brings me great sadness. I had hoped to keep this marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with one staff member.''</p>
        <p>Joannie Danielides, Ms. Hanover's press secretary, said Ms. Hanover was referring to Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas, Mr. Giuliani's former communications director who is now president of NYC and Company, the city's tourism bureau. Friends of Ms. Hanover's said yesterday that she had described the relationship between her husband and Ms. Lategano-Nicholas as intimate while Ms. Lategano-Nicholas worked at City Hall. The mayor has denied having had a romantic relationship with Ms. Lategano-Nicholas, who left City Hall last May and married Nicholas Nicholas, a sportswriter, in February.</p>
        <p>The mayor's reliance on Ms. Lategano-Nicholas, one of his most powerful aides, also strained his relationships with several close advisers, including David Garth and Peter F. Powers, the former first deputy mayor.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hanover also said: ''Beginning last May, I made a major effort to bring us back together. Rudy and I re-established some of our personal intimacy through the fall. At that point, he chose another path. Rudy and I will now discuss the possibility of a legal separation.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hanover said she and their children, Andrew, 14, and Caroline, 10, would continue to live at Gracie Mansion ''for at least the next few months'' for security reasons.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lategano-Nicholas issued this statement yesterday: ''I have no desire to speculate why Donna Hanover decided to issue the statement that she did. Understandably, this is a difficult time. I wish both the mayor and Donna Hanover a successful resolution.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lategano-Nicholas, 35, added  she was proud to have worked for Mr. Giuliani and that he ''is and will continue to be one of the greatest mayors in our city's history.''</p>
        <p>After attending a fund-raiser at a private home in Pelham last night, the mayor smiled and showed off a blue and orange baseball jacket with  Pelham written on the front. But he had no reaction to the statements of his wife. ''I am not going to react to it,'' he said. ''I said all I am going to say on that earlier today. This is all very painful.''</p>
        <p>He also brushed aside questions about whether he was close to withdrawing from the race, reiterating that he would make a decision based on his medical treatments.</p>
        <p>He added he had been buoyed by sympathetic New Yorkers. ''I have lots of people supporting me, lots of people who help me, and I hope to give some of that back.''</p>
        <p>Friends of Ms. Hanover's said that although she and her husband had talked in recent days about ending their 16-year marriage, Ms. Hanover did not know that Mr. Giuliani was going to announce their separation at his news conference. Friends said she learned of her husband's remarks immediately after the conclusion of the news conference, which was held on the outdoor balcony of the Bryant Park Grill in Midtown Manhattan. The friends described  Ms. Hanover as distraught.</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Giuliani's senior advisers said yesterday that the mayor's announcement caught them by surprise, too, even though Mr. Giuliani had made no secret of his estrangement from his wife during the last few years and had announced last week that Ms. Nathan, 45, a divorced mother and registered nurse who works for a pharmaceutical company and lives on the Upper East Side, was a very good friend.</p>
        <p>Pictures of Mr. Giuliani and Ms. Nathan leaving a restaurant together were first published May 3 by The New York Post. Mr. Giuliani announced that he had prostate cancer in a treatable form on April 27.</p>
        <p>It was unclear whether Mr. Giuliani had planned beforehand to announce his separation at the news conference, or whether he wandered into the remarks as reporters questioned him. Since the mayor learned he had prostate cancer, he has become increasingly personal and introspective in his news briefings.</p>
        <p>Yesterday Mr. Giuliani had no official statement, and only began to talk about his marriage after a reporter asked him for a reaction to comments made on Tuesday by Joseph L. Bruno, the state Senate majority leader.</p>
        <p>In a radio interview in Albany, Mr. Bruno urged Mr. Giuliani to resolve his differences with Ms. Hanover, who said outside St. Patrick's Cathedral last weekend that her husband and her marriage ''have been very precious to me.'' Mr. Bruno said he was concerned that Mr. Giuliani's personal life could distract him from the Senate race.</p>
        <p>In responding to the question about Mr. Bruno, Mr. Giuliani never did say what he thought of the majority leader's remarks. Instead he said: ''This is very, very painful. For quite some time it's probably been apparent that Donna and I lead in many ways independent and separate lives. It's been a very painful road and I'm hopeful that we'll be able to formalize that in an agreement that protects our children, gives them all the security and all the protection they deserve, and protects Donna.''</p>
        <p>When pressed by reporters about whether he meant a legal separation, the mayor at first said he didn't want to give details. But when asked if his wife would move out of Gracie Mansion, Mr. Giuliani at last used the word ''separation'' by responding haltingly: ''Nobody, nobody, nobody is moving anywhere. Everybody is secure and safe. What I said is that we should try to work out a separation agreement. That's different.''</p>
        <p>The marriage is Mr. Giuliani's second. His first marriage ended in divorce and was annulled.</p>
        <p>There was only a modest group of reporters and television cameras present in a small space, and many were only a few feet from the mayor. As Mr. Giuliani continued to talk at length about his relationships with the two women, the briefing became an unusually intimate confessional for a man who has until recently guarded most aspects of his private life. At one point, Mr. Giuliani was asked if the media had caused the damage in his public life.</p>
        <p>''No,'' responded Mr. Giuliani, who has often blamed the media in the past. ''The media makes the damage worse, it didn't cause the damage. I take responsibility for everything that I've done. And you have a right to ask me and then I have a right to answer or not answer. And that's the way I think we can have A respectful relationship with each other.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani also spoke warmly of both Ms. Nathan and Ms. Hanover. ''Judith, Judith Nathan is a very, very fine person,'' the mayor said. ''She's been a very good friend to me, before I had to deal with the decisions that I have to make about my illness and what to do about it, and I rely on her, and she helps me a great deal. And I'm going to need her now more than maybe I did before.''</p>
        <p>Then he turned his comments to his wife. ''Donna Hanover is a wonderful woman,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''And she's a wonderful mother. She's someone that I respect tremendously. The fact that we've grown independent, we've grown more separate over the years, who knows why those things happen? But she is a very, very fine, wonderful person, and she's an extraordinary mother and I have tremendous respect for her.''</p>
        <p>Asked what his emotional state was at that moment, Mr. Giuliani responded: ''My emotional state is I'm very sad. And I feel terrible.''</p>
        <p>Physically, Mr. Giuliani, 55, has said he feels healthy, and has kept a vigorous schedule with appearances around the city and three trips upstate over the past two weeks. But he has also spent much of his time meeting with doctors to determine his cancer treatment.</p>
        <p>His acknowledgment of Ms. Nathan as a good friend came as his illness was generating much public sympathy. Even so, recent polls show that Mrs. Clinton is still running ahead of Mr. Giuliani statewide, and that the mayor did not get what pollsters call a ''bump'' in support after his announcement of his illness.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani concluded his comments about his turbulent personal life by saying that it had not affected the job he was doing as mayor. ''It's a job that I love,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''I love the people of the city of New York. Some of them love me and some of them hate me, but I think they all have a reaction to me.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''The job is not affected at all by this, and never will be.''</p>
