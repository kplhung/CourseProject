        <p>YOU have had a bad week. Your landlord raised the rent without notice. You had an accident with your new car just after you drove it out of the dealership. And your spouse is threatening divorce. In a wave of desperation and self-pity, you make your way to the computer and find yourself cruising the Net. Suddenly, hope appears in the form of a site that may help you learn about all these troublesome legal issues in your life.</p>
        <p>While most people never face that many disasters at once, there are times when it would be good to know more about the law -- at least enough to know if it's time to hire a professional. But with do-it-yourself sites sprouting up as quickly as you can say ''billable hours,'' it's hard to know where to begin.</p>
        <p>There are currently about a dozen legal Web sites aimed at nonlawyers and scores more presenting legal resources in a less consumer-friendly manner. Many of these sites are still in their infancy, so content and design are improving constantly.</p>
        <p>They generally follow a basic model: a legal encyclopedia with a summary of each area of the law, links for more information and a lawyer locator, searchable by city and area of practice. As a lawyer and a consumer, I have looked at several of them and picked out a few of the most interesting and authoritative sites.</p>
        <p>Nolo.com (www.nolo.com) is the online incarnation of Nolo Press, the scrappy California publishing company dedicated to empowering the layperson through access to legal information. If you arrive with a particular query, chances are you will find an answer. If you can't, pose a question to Auntie Nolo, described as a ''plainspoken, mostly patient soul.''</p>
        <p>''If there is a legal solution to your problem,'' the site says, ''Auntie will provide it. If what you need is a cup of tea, not a subpoena duces tecum, she'll tell you whether one lump or two is better.''</p>
        <p>The tone is characteristic of Nolo.com, which is both comprehensive and quirky. It  is so lighthearted that it makes learning about the law fun.</p>
        <p>There is also a legal encyclopedia, which is perfect for those times you hear a word like ''estoppel'' on ''Ally McBeal'' and don't know what it means. Even at its most offbeat, the site keeps its eye on the practical. (The article ''The Opposite of Marrying a Millionaire -- Marrying a Debtor,'' in Auntie Nolo's debt and credit section, may come in handy if the spouse who wants a divorce also has a bundle of bills.) If you had to choose one site to take to a desert island, this would be the one -- if you still had any legal issues once you got there.</p>
        <p>If you prefer your information with a healthy dose of legal news, law.com (www.law.com) is the place for you. It has the look of a newspaper, which shouldn't come as a surprise since it has the exclusive online rights to digital content from American Lawyer Media, publisher of 22 legal newspapers and journals. Though lawyers are the primary audience for law.com, consumers would be wise to bookmark it to get links to the sites lawyers themselves use for research. (For example, the site's extensive system of links will lead you to Tenant.net, where you can review New York's rent laws to see if your landlord's rent increase is legal).</p>
        <p>Interested in live advice? Try FreeAdvice.com (www.freeadvice.com), where seven days a week (during specified hours) you can have an online dialogue with a real live lawyer (or in some instances, a real live recent law school graduate not yet admitted to the bar). While it is reassuring to know that you are communicating directly with someone, the answers are filled with disclaimers and often give only a bit more information than the site's summaries. If the chat leaves you unsatisfied, some of the stock answers may meet your needs (in fact, the section Who Do I Contact After an Auto Accident, under Accident Law, is the ideal place to help you sort out your next steps in dealing with your recent fender bender.)</p>
        <p>For a thorough introduction to the legal and judicial system and top-notch advice for choosing, hiring and managing a lawyer  (including questions to ask during an interview), log on to FindLaw (www.findlaw .com) and read through Courts and Legal Process and Hiring a Lawyer, in the Consumer Center. The Small Business Center is also worth a visit for its plain English guidance on everything from business plans and finance to employment and insurance.</p>
        <p>If you know you need a lawyer but don't know where to find one, look to lawyers.com (www.lawyers.com), the site of Martindale-Hubbell, publisher of the leading print directory of law firms and lawyers.</p>
        <p>As befits its heritage, this site shines in the lawyer-search area with impressive profiles of firms and practitioners worldwide. Another strong feature is Ask a Lawyer, where you can pose a question to one of the site's experts. There is no promise that your question will be selected (timely, short queries with broad appeal have the best shot) but even if you don't get an answer, archived questions like ''Will my used car be covered by the lemon law?'' make for interesting reading.</p>
        <p>Also worthwhile for lawyer searching is Lawoffice.com (www.lawoffice.com), the site of the veteran legal publisher West Group. With a directory of more than one million legal professionals, the site's listings are loaded with lawyers' biographies, published works, representative cases and links to firms' Web sites and e-mail addresses.</p>
        <p>For a distraction from your legal problems, drop in on TheLAW.com's Strange but True, filled with legal trivia like the Louisiana law making it illegal to shoot a bank teller with a water pistol after robbing a bank. Ed Koch, the former New York City mayor, is a co-founder of the site; clicking on Ed Koch's Chambers on the home page takes you to his introduction to the site, where he invites users to send him e-mail ''to tell me: How'm I doing?'' TheLAW.com offers celebrity profiles, television and film reviews and an online courtroom. (And in the spirit of full disclosure, I must say that I have written for TheLAW.com.) On the serious side, the site has support groups and live chats with social workers for those dealing with emotional issues like adoption and employment discrimination.</p>
        <p>One legal task we all inevitably face is the drafting of a will. To see how ordinary people and celebrities from Benjamin Franklin to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis handled theirs, find your way to Wills on the Web (www.ca-probate.com/wills.htm), which displays real wills from 1493 to the present. When you are ready to tackle your own will, EstatePlanningLinks.com (www .estateplanninglinks.com) answers everything from ''Why Have a Will?'' to ''What to bring to your first meeting with an estate planning attorney'' and has links to numerous self-help resources.</p>
        <p>Finally, if you are dissatisfied with Cliff Notes versions of the law offered at some of the consumer sites, visit the Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute (www.law.cornell.edu), probably the most expansive legal reference tool online. Useful features include ''Law About . . .'' (with links to every legal topic imaginable), constitutions and codes, court opinions, law by source or jurisdiction, and the American Legal Ethics Library (it's longer than you think). The site is popular with lawyers and is equally accessible to nonlawyers who would rather read statutes and judicial opinions than simplified summaries.</p>
        <p>Used properly, legal Web sites can enhance your understanding of the law and from time to time may even convince you that a legal issue isn't worth pursuing with a lawyer. When you do need a lawyer, spending some time at one or more of these sites can help you choose the right one, manage that person properly and know the basics about the legal subject matter you are discussing.</p>
        <p>As to the rules governing online legal advice, there are no laws that apply specifically to Web sites. The problems that might arise for lawyers have to do primarily with advertising. If a site is deemed to be advertising (as opposed to the publishing of free information), the lawyers involved would be subject to laws governing false advertising as well as bar association ethics restrictions on advertising by lawyers.</p>
        <p>In the borderless land of the Web, lawyers could find themselves in tangles with their bar associations about such things as whether postings on lawyer referral services constitute advertising in a state where a lawyer is not admitted to practice law.</p>
        <p>Even more delicate is the question of whether lawyers involved with sites are engaging in the unauthorized practice of law by offering online advice that is available in states where they are not admitted to the bar. Though lawyers rely on lengthy disclaimers, for now this is unchartered territory that is certain to provide legal ethicists and the courts with ample fodder for a new breed of cases.</p>
        <p>Finally, if online advice is deemed to be the practice of law (an open question and one that all the disclaimers on the sites are trying to rule out), a lawyer could commit malpractice by giving advice that turned out to be wrong.</p>
        <p>For the person using the Web sites, reliance on online legal advice has its dangers. These sites are not substitutes for lawyers, and they are only as good as the information they contain -- which could be out of date, oversimplified or just plain wrong. And if you get bad advice, you don't have a bar association available to handle your complaint, as you would if you had been dealing with a real lawyer. Above all, keep in mind that in the world of free counsel, you may just get what you pay for.</p>
