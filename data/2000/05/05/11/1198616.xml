        <p>Ever since Championship Auto Racing Teams pulled out of the Indianapolis 500 four years ago, Al Unser Jr. has dreamed of returning. Competing without winning since 1996 for Marlboro Team Penske, Unser wondered if the destructive feud between CART and the Indy Racing League would ever end.</p>
        <p>The low point came in May 1996, when CART brazenly scheduled the U.S. 500 at the Michigan Speedway -- with most of the stars of open-wheel racing -- on the same day as the Indianapolis 500.</p>
        <p>''I'm going down the back straightaway, and there's no grandstand,'' he said during an interview yesterday. ''Down the back and up the front straightaway, maybe halfway up the seats, you had people. It was a huge letdown, not to be at the Indy 500. It was a killer. There's been a hole in my heart ever since.''</p>
        <p>That wound is healing. Last November, he defected to Indy Racing -- and its jewel, the Indianapolis 500 -- to sign with Galles ECR Racing. Three weeks ago, he won the Vegas Indy 300 on Indy Racing's Northern Lights Series. He tested his car, emotions and memories at the Brickyard last month (an experience that he compared to ''riding a bicycle''), his first time on the track since he failed to qualify for the Indy 500 in 1995.</p>
        <p>''I don't care if they race Go Karts at Indy, I wanted to get back there,'' said Unser, 38.</p>
        <p>Unser's ardor for the race is understandable. He won it in 1992 and 1994. His father, Al Sr., won it four times. His cousins Robby and Johnny competed in it last year. His Uncle Bobby won it three times and his Uncle Jerry died there in 1959.</p>
        <p>''It means so much to my family, and the way my family sees it, and the way I see it, the reason there's a Daytona 500 is because there's an Indy 500,'' he said. ''The Indy 500 is the reason why you have races around the country and around the world. It's the first race, it's the oldest and it's the best.''</p>
        <p>Leaving CART meant turning his back on the circuit where most of his career victories occurred. CART is older than Indy Racing, has more races, 20, to nine, and bigger sponsors. But CART is the stronger rival in a sport weakened by the continuing split, which created a void that Nascar has easily exploited.</p>
        <p>''I was in my contract year and I had to decide, 'Do I stay in CART or go back to Indy -- or are they going to get it together?'' he said. ''This was the prime of my life. I'd missed Indy for five years. I asked around to see if the two series would get it together soon. And when I signed my contract, indications were that they wouldn't stay apart much longer.''</p>
        <p>But talks between Tony George, who founded the Indy Racing League to compete with CART, and Andrew Craig, CART's chairman, have yielded little hope for peace.</p>
        <p>''So I had to do some serious thinking,'' Unser said. ''A hundred years from now, what will be here, CART or the Indy 500? I think the Indy 500 will be here. The Indy 500 is bigger than all of us. It's bigger than the Unser family. It's bigger than the Andretti family. It's an event that nothing can destroy. I decided I couldn't miss another one.''</p>
        <p>Leaving CART means racing under Indy's different technical guidelines, which Unser said promote parity by not letting the wealthiest race teams spend untold sums on engines that can't be afforded by all.</p>
        <p>That, too, presented a problem for Unser. He loves the concept of fairly gaining an unfair advantage. In 1994, Penske capitalized on a vague rule by equipping Unser's and car and two others with a supremely powerful Mercedes-Benz engine that no other driver had. Unser raced to an overwhelming victory.</p>
        <p>''It was in the rule book, we weren't cheating, we were legal and we thought it was great,'' he said. ''And I'd still love to have that unfair advantage over the competition. But the last few years, we designed and built our own cars, but they weren't fast.''</p>
        <p>But to return to the Indy 500, Unser has cast his lot with a series that he says discourages technical one-upsmanship for race parity.</p>
        <p>''If you give me the equal equipment that everyone else has,'' he said, ''and leave it up to my talent and thinking and my race team's strategy, we'll come out on top.''</p>
