        <p>There were so many positives that could have come from the Mets' game against the Pittsburgh Pirates tonight.</p>
        <p>For a while, they were getting the best out of Rickey Henderson. The middle of their order produced a big inning that gave one of their most reliable starters, Rick Reed, a five-run lead. They knocked out one of the National League's better starters and got into the Pirates' bullpen in the fourth.</p>
        <p>But in the end, the Mets lost, 13-9, and in the process allowed 20 hits in a game for the first time since 1992.</p>
        <p>''We got the lead to the bullpen, and most of the time when we've done that, we've been able to close the door,'' said Pat Mahomes, who allowed hits to all five Pirates he faced in relief. ''Tonight, it seemed like we all kind of struggled a bit.''</p>
        <p>The five-run lead was the largest the Mets have blown this year. Reed allowed six runs, and the bullpen let in seven. Melvin Mora misplayed a ball in center field in the sixth, allowing the tying run to score, and later was at the plate for a botched suicide squeeze. In the decisive seventh inning, a crucial Pirates double fell just in front of Henderson.</p>
        <p>Henderson, who remains a member of the Mets after clearing outright waivers today, played like the Hall of Famer he will be, not the struggling player he has been most of this year. He singled to lead off the game, stole second -- it was just his third steal this year -- and scored two grounders later. It was a manufactured run, in the vintage Henderson style. He later drew two walks and singled in the sixth in his 10,000th career at-bat.</p>
        <p>''Slowly but surely, it's starting to work itself out,'' Henderson said. ''I knew it would work out, but I've just got to keep at it.''</p>
        <p>After the fourth of Wil Cordero's five hits gave the Pirates an 8-7 lead in the seventh, John Vander Wal twisted a high fly down the left-field line. Henderson, shading Vander Wal to pull, gave chase but stopped as the ball landed a few feet in front of him and bounced over his head, into the Mets' bullpen. Two runs scored and the Pirates widened their lead to 10-7.</p>
        <p>''I thought I had a shot at it, but it kept slicing, slicing, slicing,'' Henderson said. ''When I got there, I knew I didn't have a chance unless I dove. I didn't really want it to get by me, but it still got by me.''</p>
        <p>That inning wiped out a rally in the top of the inning that had given the Mets a 7-6 lead. Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura singled with one out -- the two had hit consecutive home runs off Todd Ritchie in the third -- and Todd Zeile stroked a run-scoring double to left, his first hit in 19 at-bats.</p>
        <p>But with runners at second and third, Manager Bobby Valentine called for a suicide squeeze, and Mora could not bunt Jose Silva's first pitch, a curveball outside. Ventura was thrown out, and after Mora was walked intentionally, Rey Ordonez struck out to end the inning.</p>
        <p>Mora has been struggling at the plate, averaging one strikeout every three at-bats. and Valentine considers him his best bunter.</p>
        <p>''I knew he had a good curveball, which is tough to hit,'' Valentine said of Silva. ''But I thought it was an easy run.''</p>
        <p>After building a 6-1 lead off Ritchie, who had his first poor start in seven outings this year, the Mets probably doubted one run would make much difference. Normally, a five-run lead is safe with Reed, who went 3-0 in April. But he lost a one-run lead against the Giants in his last start, and he labored tonight, allowing 10 hits and six runs in five-plus innings.</p>
        <p>''I don't know how I made it through five,'' Reed said. ''It was unbelievable. Mike would call for a pitch away and I'd pitch it in, or vice versa. I just couldn't get the ball down in the zone.''</p>
        <p>The Pirates hit it wherever the Mets put it on an evening of promise that turned ugly. ''They had their hitting shoes on,'' Valentine said. ''It looked like they hit everything. They hit our starters, hit our bullpen. They kept swinging and getting hits.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>WIL CORDERO had five hits and KEVIN YOUNG four for the Pirates, who had their most hits in a game since Aug. 4, 1998. Both players homered.</p>
        <p>The left-hander BILL PULSIPHER, who has lost his two starts this year, has been available in the bullpen the last two nights. But Manager BOBBY VALENTINE said Pulsipher was ''penciled in'' to start on Saturday against Florida, meaning GLENDON RUSCH will start Friday on his regular four days' rest.</p>
        <p>If all goes well in a rehab start for Class AAA Norfolk on Friday or Saturday, the right-hander BOBBY J. JONES (right calf strain) will start next Thursday at Shea Stadium against Colorado.</p>
