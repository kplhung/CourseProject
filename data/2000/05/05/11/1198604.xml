        <p>KNICKS fans worry. They like to worry.</p>
        <p>Correction: Knicks fans love to worry.</p>
        <p>Worry is the nature of the city. Worry defines every crevice of a city where life rests on such a fragile precipice, from the stock market to the Mets. Worry gives the city its pulse.</p>
        <p>When Knicks fans worry, the group neurosis starts at the top of Manhattan and works its way down to the tip; it extends from borough to borough.</p>
        <p>The fans come out of an enthralling come-from-behind victory delightedly drained. They come out of a loss steaming, ready to trade the goat from that particular game -- usually the Ward-Childs backcourt. They groan whenever Ewing gets the ball in the low post; erupt in cheers when he scores; throw up their hands when he misses. All the time loving every minute.</p>
        <p>Knicks fans never did warm up to Pat Riley, although they certainly appreciated his style. But Riley didn't worry, even at times like this, when as Heat coach he has had good reason to worry after his team squandered the homecourt advantage by losing Game 2 on Tuesday night. Riley never did worry. Not outwardly.</p>
        <p>Knicks fans like Jeff Van Gundy. He worries and wears worry on his sleeve. Van Gundy seems to agonize over everything from a sloppy possession to the fans' treatment of Charlie Ward, Chris Childs and especially Patrick Ewing. But the coach realizes that the outbursts are a manifestation of the fans' need to fret.</p>
        <p>''If we got rid of everybody after Game 1 who people criticized and had an opinion about, we'd have trotted out with three guys for Game 2,'' Van Gundy said.</p>
        <p>Worry may be the pastime of Knicks fans. But this will be a different kind of playoff spring for them:  worry free.</p>
        <p>For the next 12 days -- from the end of the Miami series to the conference championship -- most likely with Indiana -- Knicks fans won't have a lot to worry about. For all the game-to-game hand-wringing and analysis, the Knicks are better than the one-dimensional, muscle-bound Heat, better than the aging Pacers. Blasphemous prediction, I know. But true.</p>
        <p>The Knicks are better: better than the Heat, better than the Pacers or the Sixers, better than last year's Knicks, who reached the N.B.A. finals. These Knicks are balanced, rich in depth, rich in scorers. This is a team that can have Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston mired in shooting slumps simultaneously and still beat the Heat at Miami -- comfortably.</p>
        <p>After practice yesterday, Van Gundy said he had told Houston and Sprewell at halftime Tuesday night not to worry. They didn't have to carry the weight of the world on their shoulders. Childs and Ward could outplay Miami's backcourt with Tim Hardaway hobbled; the Heat still doesn't have an answer for Marcus Camby; and at the moment of truth, Ewing always seems able to outfox his protege, Alonzo Mourning, for crucial points.</p>
        <p>''Those two shouldn't feel the burden of 'If I don't get going, we're not going to win,' '' Van Gundy said. ''Latrell is what -- 6 for 27? I don't want him to be worried so that it takes away from the other parts of his game. He and Allan have to do the best possible job they can, play the best possible basketball they can and then deal with the result.</p>
        <p>''I'm not really worried about how to get them going. If a team wants to commit two guys to one person, then that's going to open up other things for other people, so other people are going to have to step forward like Charlie did last night.''</p>
        <p>So, what does Van Gundy worry about?</p>
        <p>''The overall mentality,'' he said. ''How we approach Game 3. Corrections we need to make to give us a chance to play better in Game 3. A writer will deal with an individual story line. For me, the team is the story line: 'How can we win?' ''</p>
        <p>Ewing spent the off day taking extra practice, shooting jumpers, flexing his knee, loosening his back. After the workout, Ewing said he wasn't worried.</p>
        <p>''I'm not worried about my back,'' he said.  ''I'm able to play; that's the bottom line. I'm not limping around like last year.''</p>
        <p>Is he hurting more than he is revealing?</p>
        <p>''I'm not even worried about that. I'm ready to play.''</p>
        <p>But what about the back?</p>
        <p>''I'm tired of answering that. Don't ask no more about my back.''</p>
        <p>Knicks fans, I know this is hard, but don't worry about this series or the next. Relax. Enjoy.</p>
        <p>There will be plenty to worry about when the finals begin, come June 2.</p>
