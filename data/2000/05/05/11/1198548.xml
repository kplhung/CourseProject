        <p>Rwanda and Uganda, allies in central Africa, are threatening to turn their well-trained armies on each other if they cannot resolve the tensions that have flared in recent days into small-scale skirmishes.</p>
        <p>Today, the top military commanders of the two nations met in Rwanda and their presidents agreed to meet in Tanzania on Sunday to head off any further fighting.</p>
        <p>But each country continued to accuse the other of massing troops along their common border -- a development that, if true, could intensify their dispute. But several outside officials said there was no evidence of major troop movements on either side.</p>
        <p>For nearly two years, Rwanda and Uganda -- small nations with outsized influence in the region -- have been fighting to oust the president of Congo, Laurent Kabila, and are thus nominally on the same side.</p>
        <p>But their troops clashed last summer in the Congolese city of Kisangani and again last Friday in a much smaller battle that nonetheless reignited the tensions and mutual distrust. At least 30 people were killed in the latest fighting, half of them civilians.</p>
        <p>The situation appeared to be easing on Monday, when the two nations agreed to a truce brokered by a United Nations team in the region and said they would pull their troops out of Kisangani to make way for peacekeepers to monitor a general cease-fire to the much larger conflict in Congo. But on Tuesday, each side accused the other of initiating a renewed round of shelling.</p>
        <p>Today, amid alternately harsh and conciliatory words from both sides, President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and President Paul Kagame of Rwanda agreed to the meeting in Tanzania. Presidents Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzanzia are to attend.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Jeje Odongo of Uganda and Brig. Gen. Kayumba Nyamvasa of Rwanda, their countries' top military leaders, met in the Rwandan capital, Kigali.</p>
        <p>Officials from both Rwanda and Uganda said they hoped the mediation would end the dispute, which has puzzled many experts because until last summer the two countries and their leaders had been close friends with common goals in Congo.</p>
        <p>''We think this is going to be defused,'' said Emmanuel Ndahiro, a spokesman for Rwanda's army and an aide to President Kagame. ''It's madness, to say the very least.''</p>
        <p>Hope Kivengere, a spokeswoman for the Ugandan president, said,  ''Our differences with Rwanda are really not fundamental.'' She added: ''When these clashes appeared, as they did last year, we sat down and sorted them out. We will sit down again on Sunday.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, a top Ugandan army official, Brig. Gen. James Kazini, was quoted today as saying that Uganda was ready to fight if provoked.</p>
        <p>''This time we're ready for them,''  The Monitor, a Ugandan newspaper, quoted him as saying. ''We're beginning to realize these people may be real enemies.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ndahiro repeated the accusation that Uganda has been building up its troop strength along its southern border, next to Rwanda. Uganda denied it had sent troops to the border, saying it has had soldiers stationed in the area for more than a year.</p>
        <p>While the dispute may seem to the outside world like so much bickering between two small nations, the stakes are high: the cooperation of Rwanda and Uganda is essential to the success of the larger cease-fire agreement in Congo.</p>
