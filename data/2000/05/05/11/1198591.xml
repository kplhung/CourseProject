        <p>A Yonkers official who is awaiting trial on charges of sexually molesting a minor whom he met through the Internet was indicted today on charges of possessing more than two dozen pornographic images of children.</p>
        <p>The official, James Surdoval, whose indictment last summer on sodomy charges stunned his associates and friends, pleaded not guilty to today's 54-count indictment, which accuses him of storing on his home computer images of children having sex on his home computer. If convicted, Mr. Surdoval could face up to four years in prison for each count.</p>
        <p>''This isn't about surfing the Net and this isn't about the First Amendment,'' said the Westchester County district attorney, Jeanine F. Pirro. ''This is about possessing obscene sexual performances by children, and that is against the law.''</p>
        <p>When the authorities seized Mr. Surdoval's computer during the original investigation, they found 10,000 pornographic photographs stored in it, those familiar with the case say. Of 6,000 pictures analyzed so far, 27 clearly depicted children under 16.</p>
        <p>Now on leave as director of the Yonkers Office of Waterfront and Downtown Development, Mr. Surdoval denied the new charges through his lawyer, Neal S. Comer. ''This is a dangerous kind of charge for any D. A. to bring,'' Mr. Comer said. ''What you have here is a man in the privacy of his own home with the doors locked, surfing the computer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Comer said that his client did frequent ''adult male news groups'' on the Internet, but had inadvertently downloaded photos depicting children. He deleted them, not realizing that they remained on the computer's hard drive, the lawyer said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Surdoval, who was a top adviser to two previous mayors of Yonkers, was indicted in August on charges of sodomizing a 15-year-old Westchester boy whom he met on the Internet. He denies the charges. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for Tuesday in that case, which is part of a continuing investigation into the abuse of the Internet by suspected pedophiles. In the last year, nine men have been indicted on charges of abusing a dozen boys; six have pleaded guilty, and one was convicted.</p>
