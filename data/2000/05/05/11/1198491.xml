        <p>''Franklin Street is going to become the design center of New York,'' said Evan Snyderman, 29, an owner of TriBeCa's newest upscale vintage furniture store, R 20th Century Design, an adjunct to the R in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The new R wants to publicize less-known modern masters and on May 22 will open a show of 53 pieces by the Dutch designer Cees Braakman (left, his Combex coffee table, $2,500, and chair, $2,800, from the 1940's). Mr. Braakman's work, made by the Pastoe company, celebrates joinery and 50's forms. ''It's kind of French and minimal,'' Mr. Snyderman said. R is at 82 Franklin Street; (212) 343-7979. Pastoe pieces are at Totem (71 Franklin Street).</p>
