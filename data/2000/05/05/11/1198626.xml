        <p>Twenty-nine teams had a chance to get a Hall of Fame leadoff hitter over the past two days, and every one passed. So the Mets held on to Rickey Henderson, and he started in left field and batted first against the Pittsburgh Pirates tonight.</p>
        <p>The Mets have no intention of releasing Henderson now, and because no other team was willing to pay the $20,000 waiver price to claim him and pay him the remainder of his $2 million salary this year, the Mets are essentially stuck with the contract.</p>
        <p>The Mets had placed Henderson on outright waivers, as it turns out, meaning that if another team claimed him, the Mets would have had to let him go. Henderson cleared waivers at 1 p.m. today when no team made a claim.</p>
        <p>That the Mets risked losing him in such a manner is an indication that the club no longer believes the slumping Henderson is worth having at the salary he makes.</p>
        <p>''I think they've been trying to move him for some time, and they probably just weren't able to,'' an official from another team said. ''A lot of times clubs will run even superstars through outright waivers to see if someone will claim him for $20,000. Basically you're saying: 'I'm giving this guy to you for $20,000. I get $20,000 and get rid of his contract.' ''</p>
        <p>With no team agreeing to do that, the Mets plan to hold on to Henderson in hopes that he will start producing. Baseball's career stolen-base king, Henderson has only three stolen bases and a .220 batting average.</p>
        <p>''The perception that anything's been done to release Rickey is not accurate,'' said Mets General Manager Steve Phillips, who is prohibited by baseball rules from acknowledging if he has put a player on waivers. ''If we wanted to release Rickey, we would release Rickey, or any other player. If you want to release a player, you release a player. You don't have to wait for anything else to happen.''</p>
        <p>If the Mets put Henderson on unconditional release waivers, they would have to release him first, meaning his association with the team would be over. Teams would have a chance to claim him for $1 but would have to assume the remainder of his contract to do so.</p>
        <p>The 41-year-old Henderson is struggling, but the Mets have no players on their major league roster who are proven leadoff hitters. They do have a prototype leadoff man at Class AAA Norfolk, 23-year-old Jason Tyner, a former No. 1 draft pick, but he is not considered ready for the majors.</p>
        <p>''There are not too many true speed guys out there,'' a different official from another team said. ''The Mets have two of them, but one's too young and one's too old.''</p>
        <p>There is always the possibility that Henderson will rediscover the form he showed last year, when he hit .315, his highest batting average in nine years, and had a .423 on-base percentage. He has been working on limiting the movement in his head when he hits, and he said he is feeling better at the plate.</p>
        <p>''I don't think he has anything to prove,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''He has a lot to improve, and I think that's what we're dealing with. He's working and that's what we're hoping for.''</p>
        <p>As for the idea that the Mets were trying to motivate Henderson by placing him on waivers, Phillips said that would not make sense.</p>
        <p>''Players never know it, so it would not be a motivating factor,'' Phillips said.</p>
        <p>Henderson said he did not know exactly what happened with the waiver situation, but said that nothing about it would bother him.</p>
        <p>''I just let it fly by,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Henderson bristled when asked if the Mets may have been trying to send him a message, setting off a lengthy monologue on what he perceives to be the negative news-media coverage of him. He said he has been hurt by stories suggesting he does not play hard and is a bad influence.</p>
        <p>''It's negative always,'' he told reporters. ''Y'all want me out of New York? I'll go play somewhere else. I've been playing 21 years. I've done more than most anybody in this ballpark has done. But the only thing is negative.</p>
        <p>''I'm not a negative person. I read in the paper I'm a bad influence in the clubhouse. I ain't no trouble to anybody in my life, but I'm a negative person. Negative Rickey.</p>
        <p>''Get in the paper and put some headlines positive about Rickey. Because this is ridiculous. This is a joke to me. I don't play this game with my dignity and my heart for it to be a joke.''</p>
