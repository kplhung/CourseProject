        <p>Easily the most unpleasant character in ''The Love Machine,'' Gordon Eriksen's malicious satire of cybersex, is the movie's pushy prime mover, Becca Campbell (Marlene Forte), a fictional documentary filmmaker who doesn't know the meaning of the word boundary. Nosy, bullying, self-righteous and duplicitous, Becca is so intimidating to the people she interviews in the name of truth that it's a wonder any of them put up with her for more than five minutes, let alone come back for more.</p>
        <p>Those unlucky people, all connected with New York University, share something else. They lead secret erotic lives that they flaunt on personal links connected to a Web site, The-Love-Machine.com, set up as a prank by a cynical student operating out of a science lab.</p>

        <p>Easily the most unpleasant character in ''The Love Machine,'' Gordon Eriksen's malicious satire of cybersex, is the movie's pushy prime mover, Becca Campbell (Marlene Forte), a fictional documentary filmmaker who doesn't know the meaning of the word boundary. Nosy, bullying, self-righteous and duplicitous, Becca is so intimidating to the people she interviews in the name of truth that it's a wonder any of them put up with her for more than five minutes, let alone come back for more.</p>
        <p>Those unlucky people, all connected with New York University, share something else. They lead secret erotic lives that they flaunt on personal links connected to a Web site, The-Love-Machine.com, set up as a prank by a cynical student operating out of a science lab.</p>
        <p>The worst-behaved character is Julio (Gary Perez), a married professor of Latin American studies who brazenly advertises himself as a stud and exhibits nude pictures of himself and two dozen of his student conquests. The most inexplicable behavior belongs to Akira (Jun Suenaga), a Japanese student whose Web site shows pictures of him and his gay roommate, Javier (Al Rodriguez), embracing, even though Akira vehemently denies his homosexuality when confronted with the evidence.</p>
        <p>Shino (Tomo Omori) and her boyfriend, Mike (Will Keenan), are exhibitionists who troll the Internet looking to fill out a menage a trois. Beverly, a middle-aged librarian, publishes an explicit diary of her (possibly imaginary) affairs with two much younger men. Chip (Chip Garner), who is gay and black, is looking for a boyfriend but has a finicky list  of qualifications that practically ensure his quest will be futile.</p>
        <p>''The Love Machine,'' which opens today at the Pioneer Theater, is so well acted that in certain scenes it could pass as an actual documentary. Its fatal flaw is not its execution  but its premise. The movie begins  with the ludicrous assumption that the cyberspace alter egos of these characters, most of whom reveal their faces (and a great deal more), are super-secret identities that bring their owners deep shame. When Becca first interviews them under false pretenses, they are unaware that she knows of their alter egos, and every one of them blithely dismisses the idea of making erotic connections via computer.</p>
        <p>Our intrepid documentarian, however, has not only visited her subjects' racy Web sites, she has surreptitiously trailed them with a camera crew to uncover their secret lives. Exuding hostility and contempt, she bluntly confronts first Julio, who threatens legal action, and then his wife, Cecilia (Mariana Carreno), with evidence of Julio's infidelities.  She also takes it upon herself to inform Akira's fiancee, Kyoko (Kayoko Takahashi), of her boyfriend's homosexuality.</p>
        <p>The most far-fetched assumption is that a deeply closeted gay man, terrified of discovery by his strait-laced family, would allow any compromising pictures of himself to be circulated. In real life, moreover, people, especially those with exhibitionistic tendencies, are much more likely to boast about their sexual adventures in cyberspace than to try to conceal them. ''The Love Machine'' is a nasty (if titillating) little film whose notions about cybersex, shame and today's erotic climate are way off base.</p>
