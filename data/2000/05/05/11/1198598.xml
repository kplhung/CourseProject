        <p>A top city welfare official agreed to pay a Wisconsin company $1.1 million for consulting services it provided last year even though no written contract existed and no competitive bidding for the work had taken place, an arrangement the city comptroller says violated standard contracting procedures.</p>
        <p>From April 1999 until last week, city welfare officials asked Kaiser Group, of Waukesha, Wis., to provide advice on placing welfare recipients in jobs, gave the company an office and promised to find a way to pay it retroactively, said Peter E. Kaiser, the company's president.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kaiser said that the city had ultimately never paid his company for the work, and that last week, after a review of the arrangement by the mayor's office, his staff was ordered to vacate its city office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaiser said he could not explain why the city had reneged on the arrangement.</p>
        <p>''We were told to continue on, and it would be worked out,'' Mr. Kaiser said this week.</p>
        <p>City officials said yesterday that they had intended to pay Kaiser for its work but that the mayor's office reversed that plan in December.</p>
        <p>City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, who has not formally reviewed the city's dealings with Kaiser, said that no company should be providing services to the city unless it has a contract to do so.</p>
        <p>The latest contracting problems come as City Hall lawyers and contracting officers are scrambling to review a series of multimillion-dollar welfare-to-work contracts awarded by the Human Resources Administration that are now the subject of investigation. In the last week, the United States attorney's office in Manhattan has subpoenaed bid documents, e-mail messages and other city correspondences involving other welfare contracts, a city official said.</p>
        <p>The city has until tomorrow morning to turn over its records related to $104 million worth of these contracts it intended to give to Maximus, a McLean, Va., company, the city official said.</p>
        <p>Wisconsin officials said this week that they were also auditing records about Maximus. The company is also a major welfare-to-work contractor there, and it recently acknowledged that it mistakenly charged Wisconsin's welfare-to-work program for an unspecified amount of bills associated with pursuing the New York City contract.</p>
        <p>Maximus and Kaiser Group are among the handful of consultants hired by the New York City Human Resources Administration after Jason A. Turner, a former Wisconsin state official, was appointed commissioner by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in January 1998.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner, who built himself a national reputation in Wisconsin while helping lead that state's welfare-to-work effort in the mid-1990's, was hired by Mr. Giuliani to figure out a way to encourage thousands of able-bodied adults on welfare to leave city assistance programs by finding jobs in the private sector.</p>
        <p>The city has long hired outside consultants to help it provide services to the poor and disadvantaged.</p>
        <p>What differed after Mr. Turner arrived, several former and current city officials said, is that the new commissioner felt that he needed to retain several outside experts quickly to provide him advice on how to reorganize the agency's operations.</p>
        <p>A New York University political science professor, Lawrence Mead, was brought in one day a week to provide advice for about $1,000 a day, city officials said. And an executive at a conservative social-services research organization, the Hudson Institute of Indianapolis, was retained. That executive, Andrew Bush, was ultimately selected for a permanent high-level job as an agency administrator.</p>
        <p>Kaiser Group began providing advice to the Human Resources Administration in October 1998, when the company was hired under a contract with the State University at Albany. The university had access to state and federal financing aimed at helping local governments tackle the challenge of welfare reform.</p>
        <p>Eugene J. Monaco, special assistant to the provost at the Nelson A. Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy at the State University at Albany, said that the state hired Kaiser Group after the company was highly recommended for the job by Mark Hoover, the city's first deputy welfare commissioner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaiser, his staff and two subcontractors were assigned to assist a city effort to convert its welfare enrollment centers into so-called job centers, which put more of an emphasis on finding employment than simply distributing benefits for the poor.</p>
        <p>But after the company completed $541,300 worth of work, the arrangement with the State University expired at the end of March 1999. The city officials asked the state to extend the deal, but the state said that any further work would have to be paid for by the city through its own contracting process, Mr. Monaco said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaiser said his company was advised by city officials to not worry about the financing issues. And he said his project manager, Grant Collins, continued to work out of an office at the city agency's headquarters.</p>
        <p>But by late 1999, Mr. Kaiser said, he became concerned about delays in payment and how much the city owed him, and he said he asked Mr. Hoover for assurances that he would be paid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaiser said he received a letter from Mr. Hoover last Dec. 8, notifying him that the company would be paid $1.1 million for its work from April through the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaiser said the letter promised that the payment would be made as part of more than $3 million in business the agency was expecting to give Mr. Kaiser's company over the next three years.</p>
        <p>Debra Sproles, a spokeswoman for the Human Resources Administration, did not dispute this account in her statement, noting that the agency had initially ''intended to reimburse Kaiser for services performed in 1999.''</p>
        <p>But she added that under advice of the Mayor's Office of Contracting, city officials, in mid-December 1999, changed their minds, deciding that the proposed new contract with Kaiser Group should cover only services starting this year. Mr. Kaiser said he was not informed about the reversal until last week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hevesi said the entire episode with Kaiser reflected a widespread laxity in the contracting procedures at the city's welfare agency. In recent months, the Giuliani administration has dismissed Mr. Hevesi's criticisms of the agency's contracting procedures as politically motivated.</p>
        <p>''It is improper to have vendor work without a contract,'' Mr. Hevesi said. ''Such work would be unauthorized.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''It means that an agency is spending taxpayer money without going through the legal procedures that insure that money is spent properly.''</p>
