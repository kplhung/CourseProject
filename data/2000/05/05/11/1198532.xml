        <p>When it comes to regional music festivals in the United States, most fans know that the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival is the standard-bearer. That may be why, every spring, attendance seems to rise: this year's festival, which ended on Sunday, broke last year's record, drawing 467,000 people over two weekends, organizers said.</p>
        <p>The festival has always been adept not just at showing off the region's diverse musical (as well as culinary) culture, but also at organization. Even with almost 100,000 people on hand on Saturday, it was never too difficult to circulate from stage to stage, making it possible to discover chanting Mardi Gras Indians, tent-raising gospel groups and rollicking zydeco bands setting fire to the heels of scores of dancers.</p>

        <p>When it comes to regional music festivals in the United States, most fans know that the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival is the standard-bearer. That may be why, every spring, attendance seems to rise: this year's festival, which ended on Sunday, broke last year's record, drawing 467,000 people over two weekends, organizers said.</p>
        <p>The festival has always been adept not just at showing off the region's diverse musical (as well as culinary) culture, but also at organization. Even with almost 100,000 people on hand on Saturday, it was never too difficult to circulate from stage to stage, making it possible to discover chanting Mardi Gras Indians, tent-raising gospel groups and rollicking zydeco bands setting fire to the heels of scores of dancers.</p>
        <p>One reason Louisiana has such a distinct musical legacy is that it contains two of the most important catalysts for invention: a diverse supply of ingredients and a compulsion to mix them in new combinations. These factors are encoded not just in the region's history, with African, Caribbean, European and Acadian cultures colliding, but also in its present, with schoolchildren weaned on hip-hop taking up brass instruments in hopes of playing street parades. Much of the excitement this year came from watching contemporary musicians escape the homogenization impulse in favor of experimentation.</p>
        <p>The best example was a performance on Friday by the two-year-old group Lil' Band O' Gold. Even in a region where the word gumbo is applied to music almost as often as it is to food, this nine-piece band stood out as a bizarre combination.</p>
        <p>There was Warren Storm, a regional star of the 50's known for his crooning swamp-pop ballads, on drums. At the opposite end of the spectrum was Steve Riley, the accordion prodigy who remains one of the biggest draws in Cajun music. Then there was a blues-drenched rock-'n'-roller, C. C. Adcock, leaping around on guitar. On pedal-steel guitar was Richard Comeaux, whose country band River Road is on the charts. And just to make the mixture more mismatched, there was a three-man saxophone section featuring Dickie Landry, an art-minded composer who used to play in Philip Glass's ensemble. Together they whipped through accordion-fueled two-steps, slide-guitar-laced rockers and dreamy sock-hop ballads.</p>
        <p>Though the musicians hail from Lafayette, La., none of them ever thought they would end up together. ''When you're growing up in Lafayette, there's no difference between Warren Storm and Rod Stewart because they're both on the radio all the time,'' Mr. Adcock said as he drove with Mr. Landry from the Jazz and Heritage Festival to a performance at the Crawfish Festival 100 miles away in Breaux Bridge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Landry recalled his first exposure to Mr. Storm's hits: ''I hated that guy. I never liked his music.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Adcock ventured, ''That's part of why you left Lafayette.''</p>
        <p>''Yeah,'' came the answer, ''and I swore I'd never play clubs again. Now look at me: I've come full circle.''</p>
        <p>A Louisiana equivalent of Tex-Mex supergroups like Los Super Seven and the Texas Tornadoes, Lil' Band O' Gold recently put out its first album, on Shanachie Records, a 10-song disc that ranges from Ben E. King's ''Seven Letters'' to Dewey Balfa's ''Parlez-Nous a Boire'' to the beautiful ''First You Cry,'' written by the group's keyboardist, David Egan. Live, the band, which also includes the saxophonist Pat Breaux (whose grandfather first recorded the Cajun classic ''Jolie Blonde''), rarely repeats a performance.</p>
        <p>After playing a ballad-laced set at the Crawfish Festival, the tireless band returned to New Orleans that night for two sets of full-throttle jams at the Howlin' Wolf club. The affable Mr. Storm bounded off the stage at 1 a.m. in search of payment for a long day's work -- particularly long for a 63-year-old who thought he had quit drumming years ago. He held up his thumbs, both covered with bandages. ''C. C. Adcock works me like I'm still 30 years old,'' he groused, then smiled.</p>
        <p>''This is like starting all over again,'' he continued. ''It's -- what's the word? -- a career resurrection. After 50 years.''</p>
        <p>Despite releasing some 200 singles locally, Mr. Storm has never performed in the North. That will change when the band comes to Manhattan in July for several shows, including one on the 11th at Lincoln Center.</p>
        <p>Mother's Day Message</p>
        <p>If you are a delinquent child still looking for a Mother's Day present for this Sunday, visit the Internet site www.sendamy.com. That is, if your mother has a sense of humor.</p>
        <p>Amy Borkowsky, a Manhattan stand-up comedian and advertising executive, has been selling an Internet-only CD called ''Amy's Answering Machine, Volume 1'' that features 28 messages of hilarious over-concern from her mother. Thanks to this CD, full-grown and perfectly independent adults whose mothers worry about them as if they were still children can find comfort in the fact that they are not alone.</p>
        <p>In one message Ms. Borkowsky's mother asks her daughter, who lives in Midtown, if she still wears an old red robe: ''I just want to tell you that if you take out the garbage or run to the mailbox, you may want to put on something else because my friend Eileen's grandson said that red is a gang color. O.K., sweetie pie?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Borkowsky said: ''As crazy as the messages are, they all come from love. If all mothers cared so much, I say the world would be a better place. It would also be a more irritated place.''</p>
        <p>The CD, however, does not include the message that Mom left when she learned that her daughter would be exposing her messages to the world on a CD. Ms. Borkowsky recalled that her mother advised: ''I just wanted to warn you to be very wary of releasing it on any record company that wants to put it out on eight-track. A friend of mine told me that it's very hard to find the player.''</p>
