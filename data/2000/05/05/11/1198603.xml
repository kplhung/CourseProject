        <p>Asking for privacy, a young woman returned to her parents' suburban home today after serving 22 months in prison for manslaughter in the widely publicized death of her newborn son.</p>
        <p>Unlike her former boyfriend, who publicly expressed his sorrow after he was freed from prison in January, the woman, Amy S. Grossberg, referred only obliquely to the death of her child in a Delaware motel in November 1996.</p>
        <p>''Today, I am still reflecting on the past, but I am also looking forward to the obligations and opportunities that lie ahead,'' she said in a hand-written statement that a family lawyer, Robert Gottlieb, read. She also said she was thankful to be reunited with family and friends and grateful for the support she had received.</p>
        <p>The Wyckoff police said this morning that Ms. Grossberg and her parents would hold a news conference this afternoon, but the family changed their minds after arriving about noon from Delaware.</p>
        <p>After reading the two-sentence statement, Mr. Gottlieb added only that Ms. Grossberg hoped to continue her college education.</p>
        <p>After her former high school sweetheart, Brian C. Peterson, 21, returned to his mother's home here four months ago, he said at a news conference that he was sorry for his role in what he called the tragic events of November 1996. After Ms. Grossberg gave birth Nov. 12 in a motel near the University of Delaware, Mr. Peterson put the infant in a plastic bag and left him in a Dumpster. Ms. Grossberg collapsed later. Shortly after, the police found the baby's body. An autopsy found he had died of a fractured skull.</p>
        <p>The case attracted national attention, partly because of Mr. Peterson's and Ms. Grossberg's affluent suburban upbringing and partly because Delaware prosecutors initially talked of seeking the death penalty.</p>
        <p>Ms. Grossberg's 30-month prison sentence was reduced to 22 months.  She must now serve two years on parole and do community service.</p>
