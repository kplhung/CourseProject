        <p>Nearly eight years ago Aaron Paley and several friends began a reading group in Yiddish, a language that he learned from his parents while growing up in the San Fernando Valley. By 1995 Mr. Paley, an arts festival organizer, decided to create a daylong event celebrating Yiddish at a Jewish community center in suburban Sherman Oaks.</p>
        <p>''We expected a few hundred people, and 6,000 showed up,'' said Mr. Paley, 42. ''It was a wake-up call to all of us that there was a huge interest in Yiddish that had not been tapped. The language had been marginalized. It wasn't taught. It was seen as kind of nostalgic. There was no serious approach to Yiddish or Yiddish culture.</p>
        <p>''We didn't want to look back, we wanted to look forward. There was something important to say today.''</p>
        <p>From those beginnings Mr. Paley helped create  the largest festival in the nation honoring Yiddish, the 1,000-year-old language of the Jews of Eastern Europe. It is a language and, perhaps more important, a culture that is viewed at the festival as unsentimental, vibrant, emotional and alive.</p>
        <p>The festival, called ''Yiddishkayt Los Angeles,'' takes place this year from Sunday to May 21 at theaters, museums and synagogues. Its partners and sponsors range from the City of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Arts Commission to theaters and schools.</p>
        <p>The festival is part of what seems to be a general resurgent interest in Yiddish. In New Haven the Yale Repertory Company is staging a student project, ''The People Versus 'The God of Vengeance,' '' by Rebecca Taichman, who attends Yale Drama School. The play is about a 1923 obscenity trial involving a Yiddish drama, ''The God of Vengeance,'' by Sholem Asch.</p>
        <p>Like Los Angeles, New York seems to be witnessing a Yiddish revival. Pearl Gluck, director of literary programs at the Jewish Community Center at 15 West 65th Street in Manhattan, said that summer programs and Yiddish classes were  proliferating around the city, and that poetry readings, film series and music festivals involving Jewish culture were now taking place, especially on the Lower East Side. ''There's definitely a reattention to Yiddish and the culture around it,'' said Ms. Gluck, who will show parts of her film, ''Divan, (The Couch),'' about her own Hasidic history, at the Los Angeles festival.</p>
        <p>This festival is unusual for its Los Angeles-style blend of tradition and artiness, including experimental dances with Yiddish themes, klezmer music with modernist influences, and a performance by a satirical comedian and juggler, Sara Felder, who grew up in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, without knowing too much Yiddish but who took a crash course at Columbia University four years ago to immerse herself.</p>
        <p>''If I don't learn Yiddish, who will?'' asked Ms. Felder, 41, who lives in San Francisco. ''If I don't preserve this culture, who will do it?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Felder described herself, as she does in her act, as a contemporary lesbian American Jewish juggler. ''It's my own niche, and I'm proud of it,'' she said with a laugh.</p>
        <p>Similarly John Malashock, a choreographer who spent years dancing with the Twyla Tharp Dance troupe in New York and has worked with Lar Lubovitch, Anna Sokolow and Donald McKayle, has created a dance called ''Blessings and Curses.'' The dance, about a weaver, uses Yiddish and Sephardic folk songs, cantorial music and contemporary classics. (Karen Hartman, a playwright, wrote the story.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Malashock, who was raised in San Diego and Omaha, said that he had grown up knowing only a handful of Yiddish words, but that he deeply immersed himself in Jewish culture when his son, Duncan, was studying for his bar mitzvah four years ago.</p>
        <p>''The work I'm now doing is rooted in Jewish culture, some of it Yiddish culture, some of it Hebrew culture,'' said Mr. Malashock, 49. ''I grew up in a fairly secular atmosphere. Honestly, it wasn't hip to identify yourself by religion.</p>
        <p>''Yet I have a longing -- and I think a lot of artists are the same -- to go back and explore your background.''</p>
        <p>Isaac Bashevis Singer, the Nobel Prize-winning author who wrote in Yiddish, once described it as perhaps the only language never spoken by men in power. Once the lingua franca of Jews over most parts of the world, Yiddish arose from a number of German dialects in the ghettoes of Central Europe. Its essentially German vocabulary has been broadened over the centuries with traces of Hebrew, Slavic, Romanian and French.</p>
        <p>Prof. Eli Katz, who teaches Yiddish at the University of California at Berkeley, said there had been a distinct revival of interest in the language in recent years, and perhaps greater interest in the culture of Eastern European Jews before the Holocaust.</p>
        <p>The high point of Yiddish, he said, occurred ironically and tragically on the eve of the Holocaust, when it was spoken by millions. At the same time a significant literature was being created in cities like Warsaw, Vilnius and New York. Before Germany's annihilation of 6 million Jews, Yiddish was the tongue of more than 11 million people. Today, by to several accounts, Yiddish is spoken by perhaps 4 million Jews, mostly in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Israel, Mexico, France and several countries in Eastern Europe. Many more understand words and phrases.</p>
        <p>Professor Katz and several artists connected to the Los Angeles festival said the revival of interest stemmed from such factors as nostalgia and an effort to reclaim ethnic heritage often overlooked in past generations' rush to assimilate.</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles festival takes place in a polyglot city that has, in comparison to New York, a smaller, although pronounced, Jewish influence. There are 519,000 Jews in the Los Angeles area, and 1.45 million Jews in New York, according to the 1999 American Jewish Yearbook.</p>
        <p>Mr. Paley, who has worked in New York, and is founder and executive director of Community Arts Resources, probably the pre-eminent festival organizer in Los Angeles, said putting on such a festival in New York would prove difficult.</p>
        <p>''We're not the center of the Jewish world in this country,'' he said. ''New York is.'' As a result, various old-line organizations that have sought to perpetuate Yiddish, like the Workmen's Circle, Yivo (the Yiddish Institute for Jewish Research) and The Forward, a weekly newspaper, might want to involve themselves in such a festival, he said. ''But there are issues of turf and issues of politics, which we don't have in Los Angeles,'' said Mr. Paley. ''Sometimes it's more difficult to pull things off in New York.''</p>
        <p>The interplay of music is a dominant theme of the festival. One klezmer group, Brave Old World, which has generated strong reviews in recent years, mixes the traditional dance and wedding music of Eastern European Jews with modern and original compositions.</p>
        <p>Michael Alpert, a vocalist and violinist with the group, grew up in Los Angeles and Boston. He said the klezmer revival in the 1970's and 80's came about after several decades in which it was simply too painful for younger American-Jewish artists to explore their European heritage because of the Holocaust.</p>
        <p>''There was a deliberate attempt to replace Yiddish identity in particular with an identification with Israel and Israeli culture,'' Mr. Alpert said. Perhaps Alex Haley's book ''Roots'' as well as the movement among blacks seeking a national identity led Jews in some ways to do the same, Mr. Alpert said.</p>
        <p>''Suddenly, ethnicity and one's ethnic identity has become hip,'' he said. ''Yiddish has become hip.''</p>
