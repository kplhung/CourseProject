        <p>Organizers of the Million Mom March for ''sensible gun control'' predicted today that at least 150,000 mothers and their allies would descend on the nation's capital on Sunday, with many others at similar rallies in 67 towns and cities.</p>
        <p>Donna Dees-Thomases, the main organizer of the march, said the message to Congress was simple: ''That we have had enough.''</p>
        <p>Mark Pertschuk, legislative director for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, said at a news conference previewing the march that the event could be a transforming moment in the politics of gun control, comparable to the civil rights movement that spurred Congress to act after years of intransigence.</p>
        <p>''The Million Mom March is demanding licensing and registration, and the National Rifle Association says it can't happen here, it won't work,'' Mr. Pertschuk said. ''But Donna and the thousands of moms supporting her won't go away.''</p>
        <p>The march is committed to several gun control measures, including mandatory safety locks, the licensing of all handgun owners and the registering of all handguns.</p>
        <p>Reflecting the potential power of the march on Mother's Day, the National Rifle Association has begun a television advertising campaign around the country expressing the group's commitment to ''safe kids.''</p>
        <p>In one spot, the actress Susan Howard says: ''Can we talk woman to woman? This week you'll hear lots of disagreement about gun politics. But I think we can all agree on gun safety. We all want safe kids.'' The commercial goes on to praise the association's gun safety education program and offers $1 million to put the program ''in every classroom in America.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Dees-Thomases dismissed the advertisements as a ''smoke screen,'' adding, ''I think the mothers of this country are smart enough to recognize a gimmick when they see one.''</p>
        <p>The rifle association opposes licensing and registration, saying they are undue burdens on law-abiding citizens and unlikely to affect the criminals with guns.</p>
        <p>Several march organizers spoke at the news conference about how they came to the movement.</p>
        <p>Rachel Smith, the march coordinator for North Carolina, said her moment came after the shootings in Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., which left 15 dead and prompted an anxious request from her 11-year-old daughter, ''Promise nobody will get shot at my school.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith said she had no previous political involvement beyond voting and ''ranting and raving around the dinner table,'' but was now working 40 to 50 hours a week on this march.</p>
        <p>''We have promised our children we'll do all we can to keep them safe,'' she said. ''It is time for Congress to do the same.''</p>
        <p>Debbye Kelley-Watson of Washington, said she would be marching in memory of her son, gunned down three years ago at the age of 19.</p>
        <p>''Enough is enough,'' Ms. Kelley-Watson said. ''This Mother's Day I'm turning tears into action.''</p>
        <p>The roster of speakers on Sunday will include mothers whose children have been victims of gun violence, from Columbine High to the Michigan elementary school where a 6-year-old was killed by a classmate earlier this year.</p>
        <p>Also scheduled to speak are Sarah and James Brady, who was wounded in the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, Martin Luther King III, son of the slain civil rights leader, and Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend of Maryland, daughter of Robert F. Kennedy.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dees-Thomases said the march had depended on its grassroots volunteers and contributions from corporate sponsors like the Dannon Company, the yogurt maker, and Parents Magazine, as well as allied groups like Handgun Control and donors like Irene Diamond, an arts patron, and George Soros, the financier.</p>
