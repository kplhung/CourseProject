        <p>Donna Hanover</p>
        <p>It was a made-for-TV romance at the beginning. After a friend of Rudolph W. Giuliani, then an associate attorney general in Washington, suggested he call Donna Hanover, then a news anchorwoman, he had his secretary make the call to arrange a meeting -- actually, a television interview on a drug crackdown.</p>
        <p>Six weeks later, at Walt Disney World, Mr. Giuliani proposed. They married in April 1984.</p>
        <p>In the intervening years, Ms. Hanover has played a number of roles, from an evangelist in ''The People vs. Larry Flynt'' to the dutiful political spouse. But in recent years, she has increasingly shied away from playing the role of the city's first lady, making a name for herself with myriad jobs in television and in the movies.</p>
        <p>It was in recent weeks, however, that her role as the mayor's wife again thrust her into the political spotlight. Her decision to appear in ''The Vagina Monologues'' provoked controversy in light of Mayor Giuliani's Senate run, and she later canceled her role in the play after the mayor learned he had cancer.</p>
        <p>In the earlier years of her marriage to Mr. Giuliani, Ms. Hanover, a graduate of Stanford University and the Columbia School of Journalism, regularly accompanied her husband on his professional duties, even visiting New Haven as he prosecuted the corruption trial of Stanley M. Friedman, the Bronx Democratic leader. At the time, one of Mr. Giuliani's friends recalled that it had been difficult for him to be separated from his wife and child for a week during the trial.</p>
        <p>While campaigning for Mr. Giuliani's 1989 bid for the mayor's office, Ms. Hanover, who was born in California, starred in a campaign commercial, featuring scenes of him playing with their two children.</p>
        <p>''When I first met Rudy, he seemed strong and at the same time gentle,'' she said in the advertisement. ''And I liked that. I thought, this is the kind of man I want to be the father to my children.''</p>
        <p>She worked at WPIX-TV from 1983 to 1990, and later as a correspondent on WNYW-TV's ''Good Day New York,'' the morning news program on Channel 5, and as co-host of ''In Food Today,'' a show on the national cable Television Food Network. In dramatic roles, she has appeared on the ABC series ''The Practice,'' as well as on ''Law and Order,'' ''Family Law'' and ''Ally McBeal,'' and was praised for her performance as Ruth Carter Stapleton in ''The People vs. Larry Flynt.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hanover has played a television anchorwoman in at least seven feature films, including ''Ransom'' with Mel Gibson. She has also conducted celebrity interviews for Good Housekeeping magazine and has worked with the directors Sidney Lumet and Ron Howard.</p>
        <p>She has also branched out into teaching, as an associate faculty member at Utica College and an adjunct professor in the journalism department of New York University.</p>
        <p>In recent years, she has increasingly distanced herself from the role of political spouse, and was far less visible on the campaign trail during Mr. Giuliani's second successful run for mayor in 1997. Around that time, she also bristled when called ''Mrs. Giuliani.''</p>
        <p>Throughout her various careers, Ms. Hanover appears to have taken the advice that she offers on the Internet home page of the Food Network: ''Work hard at several projects. That way, no matter what is going wrong, something will be going right.''</p>
