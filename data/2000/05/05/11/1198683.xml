        <p>Steve Tyrell</p>
        <p>Feinstein's at the Regency</p>
        <p>A whole new world opened up for Steve Tyrell, a successful record producer, former protege of Burt Bacharach and self-described ''Italian Texan'' after his rendition of ''The Way You Look Tonight'' was featured several years ago on the soundtrack of Steve Martin's ''Father of the Bride.'' Suddenly Mr. Tyrell, who had never before sung popular standards, found himself hailed by Rosemary Clooney and other pre-rock paragons as a powerful interpreter of traditional pop. Recently he released an album, ''A New Standard'' on Atlantic, and on Tuesday evening he made his New York club debut (in an engagement through Saturday) with a six-member ensemble.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tyrell's rugged sound definitely has a classic ring. His sizable voice, packed with gravel and sass, filters Louis Armstrong through Ray Charles and Dr. John. This lived-in vocal texture automatically conveys the sensuality of a well-traveled roustabout. As for rhythm, Mr. Tyrell swings, but gently and very carefully. At Tuesday's opening night show he kept strict time, never deviating from straight, narrow melodic paths, as he reeled off ''I Can't Give You Anything but Love,'' ''I Can't Get Started,'' ''I'll Be Seeing You'' and a dozen other classic songs with an aggressive heartiness.</p>

        <p>But for all the worldliness embodied in his voice, Mr. Tyrell also exhibited a beginner's naivete. Dynamically he maintained an unvarying, medium-loud level that lent an unfortunately mechanized quality to many of his performances. That sameness, along with his stiff pop-jazz meter, suggested that Mr. Tyrell has quite a way to go if he hopes to develop a personal style to match his already potent vocal sound.</p>
