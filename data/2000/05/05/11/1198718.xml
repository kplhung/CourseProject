        <p>RUDOLPH-Andy. Born July 9, 1939, died May 8, 2000 after a short but fierce battle with cancer. Andy spent his career in the financial services industry on Wall Street. He joined National Securities Corporation based in Seattle, WA in September of 1998 as Eastern Regional Compliance Officer. He was a dedicated employee and a good friend. He will be sorely missed by all. He is survived by his dear wife Irene and mother Josephine. There will be a gathering of friends at the beloved home of Andy and Irene on Saturday May 13th from 2-7pm. In lieu of flowers rememberances to Andy's passion for music can be made to the Metropolitan Opera Guild.</p>
