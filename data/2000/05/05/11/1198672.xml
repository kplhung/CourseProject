Chickens Out,'' by Andrew Kimbrell (Op-Ed, May 8): A mandatory label indicating genetic modification raises questions about the safety of biotech foods that have been reviewed and found safe. A National Academy of Sciences panel has ''found no distinction between the health and environmental risks posed by plants modified through modern genetic engineering techniques and those produced by conventional breeding practices.''</p>

        <p>Re ''The F.D.A. Chickens Out,'' by Andrew Kimbrell (Op-Ed, May 8): A mandatory label indicating genetic modification raises questions about the safety of biotech foods that have been reviewed and found safe. A National Academy of Sciences panel has ''found no distinction between the health and environmental risks posed by plants modified through modern genetic engineering techniques and those produced by conventional breeding practices.''</p>
        <p>The F.D.A. has a policy in place that requires labeling if products of biotechnology differ from traditional products in terms of composition, nutritional content or allergenicity. Mandatory labeling is reserved for health and safety issues, while voluntary labeling is a way for the marketplace to help consumers determine which features and benefits they prefer.</p>
