        <p>Stocks dropped sharply yesterday, led by a continued sell-off in technology shares, as investors seemed to grow increasingly worried about how high the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates to keep inflation in check.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index suffered the biggest of three consecutive losses -- and its 11th biggest on record -- as the technology-heavy gauge dropped 200.28 points, or 5.59 percent, to 3,384.73. The last time it closed lower was on April 14, when the Nasdaq plummeted 9.7 percent to end its worst week ever.</p>
        <p>Issues like Intel, Cisco Systems and Motorola were among the biggest casualties but the latest downdraft, the sixth in seven sessions for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, spared almost no sector of the market except for some household-name consumer stocks, a handful of mining companies and the utility sector, a traditional bear-market haven.</p>
        <p>''We have a lot more selling pressure in this market than is generally perceived,'' said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore. ''It's not just that buyers are staying away.''</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average lost 168.97 points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,367.78, with Intel, down 10 7/8, to 106 1/16, accounting for about one-third of the slide. The company said one million of its computer motherboards were defective, and analysts said the replacement cost could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Hewlett-Packard, the second-biggest drag, shed 6 1/4, to 126 9/16.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, Cisco Systems, which reported slightly better-than-expected quarterly results after the close of the market on Tuesday, slumped 4 1/4, to 58 1/2, as investors focused on the company's doubts about being able to get all the components it needs to set up networks. And Motorola lost 18 7/16, to 86 1/2, after a Salomon Smith Barney analyst cut his rating, noting difficulties in getting components for its cellular phones.</p>
        <p>The S.&amp; P. 500 fell 29.09 points, or 2.06 percent, to 1,383.05. It is down 5.9 percent this year, compared with losses of 9.8 percent for the Dow and 16.8 percent for Nasdaq.</p>
        <p>''The trend has dramatically changed'' in recent weeks, said Ronald Shear, chief executive of the Carlin Equities Group, a trading-oriented firm heavily involved with Nasdaq stocks. ''The market's very much afraid of several more rate increases'' by the Fed, whose policy-making committee is to meet on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shear said investors were also getting a whiff of inflation, which implied at least modest doubt about the effectiveness of Fed policy. Gold stocks did nothing, but some other metal companies moved up. For example, Inco, the giant nickel producer, jumped 1 5/8, to 18 1/16.</p>
        <p>Although the main gauges finished above their lowest levels of the day, an afternoon comeback largely evaporated and the Nasdaq, which had cut a 6.08 percent dive in half, retreated again toward the close.</p>
        <p>And few seemed optimistic that the skid, which has taken 33 percent off the Nasdaq since its high of 5,048.62 on March 10, has run its course.</p>
        <p>Donald G. Berdine, chief investment officer at PNC Advisors in Pittsburgh, said that he thought the Dow could decline an additional 2 percent to 3 percent, the S.&amp; P. 500 another 6 percent to 8 percent and that the Nasdaq could slide to 3,000 before the market steadied and liquidity improved.</p>
        <p>But he said he was preparing for a resumption of rising prices during the summer after the Fed has finished raising rates, probably at its June 27 meeting. ''We're advising getting ready for the second half, getting ready to buy'' stocks like regional banks, Mr. Berdine said. He added that he would retain technology shares, concentrating on infrastructure companies and avoiding those that are purely Internet.</p>
        <p>Brokerage stocks were among the session's big losers, with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter down 5, to 66 1/8, Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs down more than 4 each, to 78 and 81 7/16 respectively, and Merrill Lynch down 3 1/4, to 100 1/4.</p>
        <p>General Motors slumped 4 7/16, to 82 1/2, after a Merrill Lynch analyst downgraded it.</p>
