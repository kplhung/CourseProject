        <p>John Stevens and his wife, Mary, have been ''going through hell'' for three years, they testified to the House Subcommittee on Social Security this week.</p>
        <p>''We always paid our bills on time and never defaulted on any obligation,'' the retired Air Force officer, 72,  told Congress, but retirement plans were dashed ''when we discovered that our Social Security numbers and names had been used to open 33 fraud accounts with a total value of $113,000. Our credit had been destroyed.''</p>
        <p>The tale of their three-year harassment by credit bureaus and banks -- primarily because their Social Security numbers had been stolen -- can be multiplied by thousands. This epidemic of ''identity theft'' is spread by the government's shameful acquiescence in the use of the Social Security numbers (SSN) held by 227 million Americans as a kind of national ID card.</p>
        <p>It was never so intended. The purpose of the number was to track earnings so that the Social Security Administration would know who was entitled to what benefits. But in the late 1930's, Hitler's Gestapo was demanding that Germans ''show us your papers''; fears of that totalitarian trend led Americans rightly to insist that the new cards be clearly marked ''Not for Identification.''</p>
        <p>Under pressure from businesses seeking quick credit checks and bureaucrats who place efficiency above personal freedom, that prevention of privacy abuse was erased. An unthinking federal government allowed the citizen's SSN to become the Medicare number, bandied about doctors' offices and drugstores and insurance companies, even emblazoned on the envelopes of mailings.</p>
        <p>With the onset of e-commerce, pressure on people to reveal their private Social Security numbers has increased tenfold. Travel agents coerce it out of customers as hurried ''proof'' of identity. Banks regularly deny loans to customers who are good credit risks if they dare to refuse to hand over the number coveted by practitioners of ''target marketing.''</p>
        <p>But a number is not a person. A number, unlike a person, can easily be kidnapped. When a number is stolen,  or when an impostor purchases your number from an ''information broker'' or the ''personal information industry''(euphemisms for e-snoops), your life is not only an open book, but it can be made a Kafkaesque hell, as the Stevenses testified.</p>
        <p>Did you know that no law prevents anyone from buying or selling your personal SSN without your consent?  Or that discourages any business from refusing to serve you unless you reveal the SSN that the government professes ''may not be used for identification purposes''?</p>
        <p>The piracy of our privacy, as well as the protection from the theft of one's credit reputation, cries out for legislation. The chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee holding these hearings, Florida's Clay Shaw, says that no one proposal can stop this theft of good names, ''but since Social Security numbers often represent the entry point for ripoff artists and identity thieves, there's no better place to start.'' The ranking Democrat, Bob Matsui, tells me he agrees that ''something has to be done.''</p>
        <p>Bills to do something protective have been introduced by the House's  four horsemen of privacy: Jerry Kleczka, Jim McDermott, Ed Markey and Ron Paul. In the Senate, Judd Gregg took note of an Internet stalker's use of an SSN to find and murder a New Hampshire woman, and put forward a bill to outlaw the sale of an SSN without the individual's consent. The Social Security inspector general testified that ''there is no reason'' to allow such trafficking in private information.</p>
        <p>I'd like to see regular public exposure of businesses that refuse services solely on the basis of a customer's refusal to supply the SSN. And I'd close down the Federal Parent Locator Service; that was well intentioned to track down employees evading child support obligations, but has become a national databank using SSN's to monitor Americans' movements -- posing a danger to civil liberty far greater than letting some dads be deadbeats.</p>
        <p>To vote in Congress to protect the SSN from being used as a national ID card, representatives must first flash their voting cards. And what do you suppose appears right beneath their names on those cards? Their Social Security numbers.</p>
