      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The battle flag of the Confederacy, which has divided South Carolina from its perch atop its Statehouse since 1962, will come off the dome on July 1, under a tentative compromise reached late tonight by the state House of Representatives.</p>
        <p>The bill, which the House passed  by a vote of 63 to 56, has already been approved with minor differences by the Senate. It calls for a smaller, square version of the flag to be placed on a flagpole near the front of the Capitol, adjacent to a Confederate soldiers' memorial. House leaders and senators predicted few difficulties in ironing out the differences, and Gov. Jim Hodges has said he will sign the bill.</p>
        <p>But the bill will by no means end the racial acrimony that had created such pressure for a compromise in the first place. Only 3 of 26 black members of the House voted for the bill, and many denounced it furiously as a plan that would make the flag an even more prominent feature of the state's official landscape. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which since last summer has been conducting an economic boycott of the state to get the flag moved, has said the plan is unacceptable, and has vowed to continue the sanctions.</p>
        <p>Once the flag comes off the dome and out of the spotlight, however, it is unclear how effective the boycott will be. The N.A.A.C.P. had originally said the boycott would continue until the flag was lowered from the dome, and its opponents are now accusing it of changing its goals because it was not a participant in the compromise.</p>
        <p>Many of the flag's longtime supporters said the move was a historic step forward for the state, which saw its reputation severely tarnished by the flag's presence in such a prominent position.</p>
        <p>''This is a defining moment for our state, a giant step forward,'' said Speaker David H. Wilkins, a Republican, who had pushed hard for a compromise.</p>
        <p>''This plan received support across party and racial lines,'' said Governor Hodges, a Democrat who was clearly relieved that the support for the plan in the House was not entirely white. ''I believe South Carolinians will join together and embrace this compromise as an honorable way to resolve this debate once and for all.''</p>
        <p>He said he could not control what the N.A.A.C.P. did, but highly praised to the three black legislators who supported the bill.</p>
        <p>Six of seven black senators had originally supported the bill, and one of their leaders, Senator Darrell Jackson, predicted that their votes would not change once the differences with the House bill were worked out. But Representative J. Todd Rutherford, a black House member who opposed the bill, predicted another debate over the new flag in next year's legislative session, vowing to propose legislation himself to move the flagpole away from the entrance.</p>
        <p>''It's a historic occasion, no doubt about that,'' Mr. Rutherford said, after tonight's vote. ''I'm just sorry that something this momentous has to occur without African-Americans being in the compromise.''</p>
        <p>The bill failed to get much black support precisely because it was designed to win the votes of white Republicans who had previously refused to even consider a vote on moving the flag. On Tuesday, Republicans angered black legislators by voting to make the flag even more prominent, raising it to 30 feet from the 20 feet in the Senate bill, and illuminating it at night. Those changes made it into the final House bill tonight, along with a provision mandating stiff penalties for anyone who vandalizes the flag or the monument. (This morning, officials had to remove spray-painted graffiti from the monument.)</p>
        <p>The bill also removes the Confederate flags from the House and Senate chambers, where they have appeared next to the United States and South Carolina flags for decades.</p>
        <p>The vote today came after nearly 10 hours of debate that starkly revealed the deep mistrust and animosity between the races in the House. Black leaders had hoped to support a plan that would move the flag from the Confederate memorial, but would also erect flagpoles bearing military banners to honor soldiers who fell in four 20th-century wars. Republican leaders would accept the plan only if it would fly the flag from the dome on Confederate Memorial Day every year, which by coincidence was today.</p>
        <p>Hardliners on each side found those aspects unacceptable.</p>
        <p>''To fly that flag for a day, even for an hour, even for a minute, is unacceptable to us,'' said Representative Joseph H. Neal, a black Democrat who said he would have supported the plan if not for the one-day-a-year provision. ''It is not a sovereign flag, and it is an insult to people of color.''</p>
        <p>White Republicans who want to keep the flag on the dome picked apart the plan from the other end of the spectrum, criticizing it for not honoring soldiers in the Revolutionary War, or for being vague on which flags which symbolize certain wars. The majority leader, Richard M. Quinn Jr., a Republican who supported the proposal, said it was hurt when black members compared the Confederate flag to a swastika, and when a protester burned the flag in front of the Capitol shortly after noon.</p>
