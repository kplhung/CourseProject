        <p>This wealthy town can no longer ban out-of-towners from its parks and beaches, the state's second-highest court said today in a ruling that lawyers on both sides agreed could affect public access to parks all over Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Reversing a lower court's decision in a five-year-old lawsuit, a three-member Appellate Court panel ruled unanimously that Greenwich's longstanding policy restricting its parks to residents violated a state doctrine, established by several judicial rulings over the years, that municipalities hold parks on behalf of all citizens, not just those of a particular town or city.</p>
        <p>Like several other towns in Connecticut, Greenwich limits the use of its parks and beaches by nonresidents. But the policy in Greenwich, whose parks are open all year, is among the most restrictive: outside residents can gain access only if they are accompanied by a Greenwich resident and pay a $6 fee per visit.</p>
        <p>Greenwich officials said today that they would appeal the ruling to the State Supreme Court and seek an immediate injunction to prevent nonresidents from using their parks until a final decision was rendered.</p>
        <p>They said they had 20 days to file an appeal, and in a written statement assured residents that the ruling ''does not mean that Greenwich Point will be open to nonresidents this summer.''</p>
        <p>''During the appeal process, the town ordinance will remain in force,'' the statement said.</p>
        <p>The case dates to 1995, when Brenden P. Leydon, a law student who lived in Stamford, sued Greenwich after he was turned away by a security guard while trying to jog onto Greenwich Point, a 147-acre park and beach on Long Island Sound.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leydon's suit argued that municipal parks and beaches were public forums that must be open to everyone, and that access to the shore was guaranteed because states hold navigable waters in trust for use by the public. Mr. Leydon also asserted that the policy violated his First Amendment right to freedom of expression.</p>
        <p>But in July 1998, Judge Edward R. Karazin Jr. of State Superior Court rejected the lawsuit, saying Mr. Leydon had failed to prove that he intended to enter Greenwich Point to exchange ideas with other park users. The judge said that because the town did allow outsiders to enter the park with a resident, its policy did not restrict freedom of expression. He also cited a 1919 special act of the State Legislature that gave the town the authority to maintain its public parks and beaches for the use of its citizens.</p>
        <p>In today's decision, the Appellate Court responded to that argument by saying that nothing in the language of the special act ''indicates that the Legislature intended the town to maintain parks and beaches for the benefit of only its residents.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leydon said today that despite the town's intent to appeal, he expected victory.</p>
        <p>''I have never had any doubt at all that I would win this case eventually,  because the public trust doctrine is very clear, and I am pleased the court agreed,'' said Mr. Leydon, who is now a lawyer in Stamford.</p>
        <p>Greenwich's highest-ranking official, First Selectman Lolly Prince, said the town would continue fighting ''as long as we have to.''</p>
