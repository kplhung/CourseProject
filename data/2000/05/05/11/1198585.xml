        <p>On the eve of the first senatorial debate between former Gov. Jim Florio and Jon S.

        <p>On the eve of the first senatorial debate between former Gov. Jim Florio and Jon S. Corzine, new polling data suggest that Mr. Corzine's million-dollar-a-week television advertising campaign is having the desired effect, narrowing the race and driving up Mr. Florio's unfavorable ratings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company who is breaking all records for spending in a United States Senate primary, began running television commercials on March 15, the earliest start in memory. For the last two weeks his advertisements, which are becoming familiar interruptions to news programs, talk shows and even sporting events on the New York and Philadelphia stations, have been increasingly critical of Mr. Florio, who cannot afford to run his ads so early.</p>
        <p>Now, with 26 days left until the June 6 primary, a Quinnipiac College Poll has found that fully 30 percent of registered Democrats view Mr. Florio unfavorably -- exactly twice as many as in the college's last survey, before Mr. Corzine's attack ads began running.</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Florio acknowledged that there has been a swing away from their candidate since Mr. Corzine's ads began, but they said their own television advertising in the last two weeks of the primary campaign would make up any gap.</p>
        <p>The Quinnipiac poll, conducted May 1 through 8, also found that Mr. Corzine had zoomed ahead in the race, from 24 points behind on March 29 to a lead of 15 points, or 48 to 33 percent. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 5 percentage points.</p>
        <p>But aides to both candidates disputed that finding, noting that Quinnipiac, in Hamden, Conn., surveyed 347 randomly selected people who identified themselves as registered Democrats. It did not, they noted, sift out those Democrats who would be most likely to vote in the primary.</p>
        <p>''Florio's base is the most hard-core, activist group of primary voters, a very narrow sliver of the electorate,'' said one adviser to Mr. Corzine. ''So Jim Florio polls best with that group, and less well the broader the sample is.''</p>
        <p>Still, the Corzine campaign released partial results of its own most recent survey, taken May 3 and 4, showing that the wide lead Mr. Florio once had over his rival, a political newcomer, had dwindled to just 6 percentage points among Democrats considered certain or very likely to vote -- a finding that aides to Mr. Florio said essentially matched their own surveys.</p>
        <p>''Let me make spin history by fully acknowledging that our own internal polling shows our opponent to be running stronger than the Quinnipiac Poll indicates -- and in fact, shows Jim Florio ahead, which is what we believe,'' said Steven Goldstein, a co-manager of Corzine's campaign. ''Jon Corzine remains the underdog in this race. But any way you look at it, the momentum is in Jon's direction.''</p>
        <p>As for the Republican primary, the Quinnipiac poll showed that 46 percent of registered Republicans remained undecided. United States Representative Robert D. Franks had the most support, with 18 percent, but his lead over State Senator William L. Gormley was less than the margin of error.</p>
        <p>Scott McLean, a political science professor at Quinnipiac, defended its polling methodology, saying that the election was too far away to identify likely voters reliably. But even he suggested that the wide lead his survey attributed to Mr. Corzine could evaporate quickly once Mr. Florio began running his own television ads.</p>
        <p>''It's not the amount of Corzine ads, it's the fact that they're unanswered,'' he said. ''An ad in response to Corzine's would help Florio a lot. Also a good performance in the debate tomorrow. The Democratic debates are now all the more crucial.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine and Mr. Florio will appear in Trenton at a debate sponsored by The New York Times and the New Jersey Network, which will broadcast it on Thursday at 9 p.m. More debates are scheduled for next Monday, Tuesday and Thursday on other broadcast outlets.</p>
        <p>Mr. McLean also noted that 55 percent of the Democrats surveyed said they still had not heard enough about Mr. Corzine to form an opinion. ''This primary is going to be decided based on who's got the deepest loyalty of voters, and who can get voters out on Election Day,'' he said. ''Even though Corzine has the lead, his support is very soft. There are a lot of people who are planning to vote for Corzine who are also saying they haven't heard enough about him. They've come to support him in the last 30 days. Florio's supporters have been with him for 30 years.''</p>
        <p>Douglas Schoen, Mr. Corzine's pollster, disagreed. ''In our polls, Jon's support is just as firm as Jim's support,'' he said. ''We're seeing, when we ask people whether they'll change their minds, as many of Florio's as Corzine's say they might.''</p>
        <p>But undisputed by Mr. McLean or aides to both candidates was that  whatever the change in the dynamics of the Democratic race, it could be traced to Mr. Corzine's ads. His commercials attacking Mr. Florio remind voters of Mr. Florio's 1990 tax increase of $2.8 billion and associate the former governor with the 1989-90 recession that crippled New Jersey's economy and the nation's.</p>
        <p>''Jon Corzine has run an extremely negative and nasty campaign,'' said Jim Lanard, a Florio spokesman. ''He has torn down the reputation of Jim Florio, and understandably, some people have switched from supporting the governor to supporting Jon. But the support is so weak that we are very confident the voters will come back to our column.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio has been left to attack Mr. Corzine's record through frequent news conferences. Today, his aides again tried to link Mr. Corzine to two companies doing business with the Sudanese government, which has killed and enslaved thousands of its citizens.</p>
        <p>Several major pension funds have already divested their shares of one such company, Talisman Energy, including that of New Jersey's public employees. But when Mr. Corzine was co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, it underwrote a bond issue for Talisman, and it is now promoting a stock offering for another company involved in a Sudanese pipeline.</p>
        <p>In a call arranged by Florio aides, Adam Pener, senior analyst at the William J. Casey Institute, said that as a major shareholder in Goldman Sachs, Mr. Corzine should speak out against the firm's role in the stock offering. ''Why would any Wall Street company even bring such an offer to market?'' he said.</p>
