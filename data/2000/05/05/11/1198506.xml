        <p>SUSAN MAC TAVISH BEST, a Webmaster in San Francisco, had a routine for paying her bills. She let them collect in piles, then dealt with them when the spirit moved her.</p>
        <p>''I am incredibly unorganized and always pay my bills late,'' Miss MacTavish Best said. But she knew that she could not indulge her penchant for disorganization and procrastination during a three-month trek to India that began last September.</p>
        <p>Then she heard a radio advertisement promoting a bill aggregator, a term that is coming into use to describe services that  receive customers' bills, display them online for their customers to view and pay them from the customers' bank, savings or investment accounts.</p>
        <p>Miss MacTavish Best used the advertised service, Paytrust, while she was away and continues to use it now, receiving an e-mail message when each bill comes in. She can look at any bill online, but she has told the service to pay some of them whether she looks at them or not, provided they are below a figure she has set for each. Other bills she reviews, then pays according to her old routine: when the spirit moves her.</p>
        <p>''They send reminders, 'Bill due in three days,' 'Bill due in two days,' 'Bill due today,' '' Miss MacTavish Best said. ''Then -- I am so lazy -- I figure I'd better take care of it. I hit the link, and it's paid.'' Despite toying with fate, she said, she has not incurred a late fee since joining.</p>
        <p>Bill-paying services are a step toward the day when everyone will receive and pay all their bills electronically. That day once seemed a long way off, when the concept of electronic billing was caught in a kind of economic Catch 22. Companies did not offer it because they did not see customers lining up to sign on. Customers did not sign on because there were no services offered. While online banks and other Web-based services developed to offer bill payments, most just write and mail checks in response to a customer's request that a payment be sent to a particular place. Few actually receive the bills for the customer.</p>
        <p>Aggregators are taking the risk to develop the market. Companies like Paytrust (www.paytrust.com), PayMyBills (www.paymybills.com) and CyberBills (www.statusfactory.com) arrange to receive a client's bills, which they scan so clients can see them on the Web. They then organize the bills and pay them as directed. The companies charge users a monthly fee that ranges from $3.95 to $29.95, depending upon the number of bills paid.</p>
        <p>Even with the fees, the companies are not yet making money. Handling people's bills is expensive; an army of employees opens envelopes by hand, puts the bills on a scanner and converts them into digital images. The companies are calculating that if they can deliver the customers, more merchants will automate the way they send out bills and collect payments, and the cost to provide the service will come down.</p>
        <p>That possibility is enticing enough that online financial service providers like Quicken and portals like AOL say they plan to offer bill aggregation before the end of the summer. Others, like Spectrum EBP, a joint venture of Chase Manhattan, First Union and Wells Fargo, are working to develop a closely related service called bill presentment. In bill aggregation, paper bills are mailed to agencies; in bill presentment, all incoming bills are handled electronically.</p>
        <p>Bill services' customers, like Miss MacTavish Best, can pay any bill at any time from anywhere. ''I was in Delhi and I couldn't remember my password,'' Miss MacTavish Best said, ''so I sent an e-mail and got an immediate response. I was sitting there in the cafe and we were e-mailing back and forth, having a conversation. There is a 12-hour difference so I was thinking, 'It's like 4 in the morning.' ''</p>
        <p>Bill-paying services do have their critics. Because the services need access to users' bank accounts, banks have raised privacy concerns. Union Trust once filed suit against an aggregator, Paytrust, to keep it from asking bank clients to share their online identification and passwords.</p>
        <p>''If they have an unscrupulous employee, they could execute a trade, move your money, they could wipe you out,'' said Kellie Scott, senior vice president and director of eChannels, the e-commerce division of Union Trust. The suit was dropped, and now many banks and aggregators are working together to establish safe procedures for sharing information.</p>
        <p>As with any new technology service, there are glitches. When a San Francisco public relations firm, pr@paiz.com, failed to put the proper code on a bill a client wanted to pay through PayMyBills, the firm never received the money. ''We called over there and the bill was just sitting there,'' said Damon Paiz, a part-owner of the agency. ''They didn't try to call us to say our bill was just sitting there. It was just very unprofessional.'' Since then, Mr. Paiz said, there have been no problems. A PayMyBills spokesman said the company had added a research team to handle payments for bills with incorrect codes.</p>
        <p>The sites are not completely seamless for consumers. There are only about 30 companies -- most of them utilities and phone companies -- that accept electronic payments so to pay any other bill, the user must authorize the aggregator to make the payment at least five days in advance to give it time to go through the mail.</p>
        <p>And although banks and bill-paying services are working on ways to share information, few arrangements have been set up. Most people who use an aggregator's services still have to visit their banks' Web sites if they want to check their balances before they approve a payment.</p>
        <p>''I can't check my balances real time,'' said Brad Winney, who banks with Citibank and pays bills through Paytrust. ''I have to go to my banking application.'' Mr. Winney said he was satisfied over all because he estimated that the service was saving him more than $1,000 in late fees each year.</p>
        <p>Aggregators and banks say they are trying to make it easier for people to use bill-paying services.</p>
        <p>''This is taking off faster than anyone expected,'' said Ms. Scott, of Union Trust. ''I think it will all be pretty seamless by the end of next year.''</p>
        <p>Signing up with a service is fairly simple and takes about an hour overall. Most require a user to fill out an online form with information like the billing address, the bank account number and a password. Most then send a package in the mail with a form to sign that will allow the aggregator to take money from an account at a bank, savings and loan or brokerage. Most services allow multiple accounts, and payments can be drawn from any of them.</p>
        <p>Paytrust has an accelerated sign-up system that lets users download a permission form and fax it back.</p>
        <p>In a test, the form was processed and the account activated online in about four hours. Users can determine which bills are to be paid through the site.</p>
        <p>Some companies say they have a similar automated system to change the address back if a client wants to go back to receiving bills at home.</p>
        <p>Others, like CyberBills' Status Factory, leave it to the customer to alert billers to a change of address.</p>
        <p>To save the user keystrokes, sites have compiled lists with the addresses and payment information for many banks and savings and loans, credit card companies and insurance and mortgage companies; those names can be added to a consumer's list with a few mouse clicks.</p>
        <p>Paytrust notifies the companies sending bills that they should send them directly to the site. Some sites require users to mail change-of-address notices to billers, using stickers and envelopes included in the sign-up packages, to tell them to send bills to the aggregators.</p>
        <p>The sites let users set up rules for paying each bill. For instance, a user can tell the site to pay the phone bill automatically on the 25th of each month if the amount due is less than $100. If it is more, the system will alert the user, who can then manually authorize a payment.</p>
        <p>Check writing is not limited to financial companies. People can have checks sent to anyone by typing in the relevant information, just as they would for online banking.</p>
        <p>''That lets us be the 100 percent solution for your monthly bills,'' said Tom Lazaroff, marketing director for PayMyBills.com. ''You can pay your gardener, your dry cleaner, or send a check to Aunt Sally in Minnesota.''</p>
        <p>When a bill arrives, the user gets an e-mail notice. Reminders are sent by e-mail for unpaid bills that nearing their due date. A confirmation is sent by e-mail when a payment has been made.</p>
        <p>Check information can be exported from the Web site into financial management programs like Quicken and Microsoft Money, as well as directly to spreadsheets.</p>
        <p>The sites also archive payment information. Most said they would keep two years' worth of records on hand. And at the end of each year, the sites offer to sell clients their records on a CD. The CD's have scans of all the bills, a summary of billing categories and in some cases, feature a rudimentary ability to search for specific bills or information. The CD's are usually priced at $15 to $30.</p>
        <p>The sites are sometimes a little quirky. The Paytrust site could not find an address for USAA Savings Bank, with USAA capitalized, but it found the name when it was lowercased. Also, the site would not allow two transactions in which the same amount was to go to the same biller on the same day so a user could not make two car payments with separate checks in one day.</p>
        <p>The services are popular with technophile ''early adopters,'' but they are still far from ubiquitous.</p>
        <p>Paytrust, which says it is the largest of the aggregators, said it had 30,000 active members. PayMyBills and Status Factory declined to cite customer numbers.</p>
        <p>Some potential customers may be concerned about security. ''I was leery of Paytrust because you have to send to the bank letting Paytrust take out money,'' Mr. Winney said. To calm those qualms, Paytrust and PayMyBills are both insured by the Travellers Insurance Group Safeweb program, which protects users against unauthorized transactions up to $100,000. Status Factory, the retail Web site of CyberBills, promises to refund twice the amount of any loss to any customer using a 128-bit encrypted Web browser, like recent versions of Netscape's Navigator or Microsoft's Internet Explorer.</p>
        <p>If payments are late because of the sites's errors, the companies will pay any late fees and get in touch with creditors. CyberBills' Status Factory will pay up to $1,000 for any bill that is late due to its error.</p>
        <p>If nothing else, the sites offer one attractive and unadvertised bonus: they handle those advertisements that are sent along with your bills. ''They are shredded,'' Mr. Lazaroff said, ''and you don't have to look at junk mail.''</p>
        <p>What Does It Cost?  Bill-Paying Services Offer Consumers A Variety of Plans</p>
        <p>Users like to say that bill aggregation services cost less than the stamps they used to mail out payments each month. That is not quite true -- but it is close. Here is what some services charge:</p>
        <p>PAYTRUST: www.paytrust.com  Users can get started within hours. The cost is $8.95 a month for 25 transactions, 50 cents for each additional transaction and an optional $14.95 for a year's financial records on a CD.</p>
        <p>PAYMYBILLS: www.paymybills.com  In addition to paying their bills, users can also analyze their spending habits, a big help when budgeting. PayMyBills charges $8.95 for 25 transactions a month, 50 cents for each additional transaction and $24.95 for a year's financial records on a CD.</p>
        <p>CYBERBILLS: www.statusfactory.com  CyberBills offers double your money back for an unauthorized transaction, provided you use a secure browser. It offers three levels of service, starting at $3.50 a month for five transactions. The mid-level service costs $8.95 for 30 transactions and 75 cents for each additional transaction. Basic plan users who exceed five transactions are automatically switched to the mid-level service. The premium service is $29.95 a month for unlimited transactions. A year-end CD is $49.50 for the low- and mid-level service, and free with the premium service.</p>
