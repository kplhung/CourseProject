        <p>The Internet revolution has allowed people with unconventional professional backgrounds to become far more successful far more quickly than they might have in the past.</p>
        <p>Now comes a new way to become a budding cyberspace entrepreneur: start out as John W. Sidgmore's secretary. At least it seems to be working for Paula Jagemann, 34.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sidgmore, 49, is vice chairman of WorldCom and chief of its UUnet unit. He has invested in and become chairman of Ms. Jagemann's dot-com venture for the office supply industry, eCommerce Industries, based in Tysons Corner, Va.</p>
        <p>Today, the company, which prefers to be known as ECI2 , intends to announce that it has formed the first electronic exchange to link office- supply manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers. It also plans to announce the acquisition of two small private software companies for about $15 million in cash and stock.</p>
        <p>The stock of ECI2  has value because the company is also set to announce a $40 million round of financing from two venture capital firms, Accel Partners and New Enterprise Associates. One reason such prominent firms have agreed to invest in ECI2  may be that its board includes Mory Ejabat, former chief executive of Ascend Communications, and Dan Rosen, Microsoft's general manager for Internet research. And perhaps the reason such prominent technology executives have joined ECI2 's board is Mr. Sidgmore. ''Our mission in life,'' he said, ''is to automate the 15,000 little independent guys in the office-supply business so they can win against the goliaths like Staples.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jagemann, chief executive of ECI2 , added, ''We have the first electronic platform to really bring the independent dealers up to speed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sidgmore has had faith in Ms. Jagemann for a long time. In 1989, she became his secretary when he was chief executive of Intelicom Solutions, a software company. Mr. Sidgmore aided her move into Intelicom's marketing department. She followed him to UUnet a few years later, where she headed public and investor relations.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Sidgmore is in a somewhat unusual position as chairman of one of his own customers. ECI2  buys most of its data communications services from UUnet. But so far, Mr. Sidgmore and Bernard J. Ebbers, WorldCom's chairman, think the arrangement is working.</p>
        <p>''These start-ups are really forging new ground,'' Mr. Sidgmore said, ''and I have felt for a while, and Bernie agrees, that getting in the middle of this could be important to WorldCom. And it keeps me fresh.''</p>
