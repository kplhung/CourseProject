        <p>The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission called yesterday for increased oversight of accounting firms and new rules on conflicts of interest at the firms, saying that both are necessary to keep auditors independent and standards of financial reporting in the United States high.</p>
        <p>In a speech at the New York University law school, the S.E.C. chairman, Arthur Levitt, said accounting professionals were being tempted to lower auditing standards to keep paying customers happy. ''Too many auditors are being judged not just by how well they manage an audit, but by how well they cross-market their firm's nonaudit services,'' he said, referring to consulting services that now make up the bulk of revenue at large accounting firms.</p>

        <p>The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission called yesterday for increased oversight of accounting firms and new rules on conflicts of interest at the firms, saying that both are necessary to keep auditors independent and standards of financial reporting in the United States high.</p>
        <p>In a speech at the New York University law school, the S.E.C. chairman, Arthur Levitt, said accounting professionals were being tempted to lower auditing standards to keep paying customers happy. ''Too many auditors are being judged not just by how well they manage an audit, but by how well they cross-market their firm's nonaudit services,'' he said, referring to consulting services that now make up the bulk of revenue at large accounting firms.</p>
        <p>Auditor independence and reliability are is at the heart of investor confidence in corporate financial statements, Mr. Levitt said. ''With our markets at their present level and with international competition being more a factor than ever before, it's critical that we do not lose the public confidence that has made our markets the greatest in the world,'' he said in an interview. ''The surest way to lose that confidence is to step back from the commitment to full disclosure and accurate numbers.''</p>
        <p>The industry's reaction to Mr. Levitt's speech was generally supportive. ''I believe that there is a real need for a change in the regulatory environment and a need for global financial reporting standards,'' said James J. Schiro, chief executive of PricewaterhouseCoopers. ''The chairman's initiatives will play a crucial role in accomplishing that.''</p>
        <p>But Alan Anderson, senior vice president for technical services at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the industry's trade group, said: ''I'm not sure we heard anything new and different in this speech. These things have been on our plate for years.'' Revealing some sensitivity about the prospect of increased regulatory scrutiny, Mr. Anderson said he would not comment on the concept ''until we see a formal proposal.''</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. is focusing on three major areas. First, it will require accounting firms to examine their past conduct and detail any violations of independence rules that may have occurred. It also wants to see greater oversight of the accounting profession by the Public Oversight Board, an independent accounting industry review organization set up by Congress more than 20 years ago after the bankruptcy of the Penn Central Railroad. As envisioned, the oversight board would better shape the agenda and the code of conduct for the profession and conduct special reviews of practices when needed.</p>
        <p>For its part, the S.E.C. staff will prepare new rules about which consulting services may be offered by accounting firms to their corporate clients and which should be forbidden given the conflicts they pose, Mr. Levitt said.</p>
        <p>Within two months, the S.E.C. staff will also come up with revised rules on stock ownership by employees of accounting firms. The existing rules, which prohibit auditors and their families from holding stock in companies the accounting firms count as customers, have been viewed as too restrictive. For example, the spouse of an accounting firm's partner in a California office is barred from owning stock in a company that is an audit client of the firm in Maine. Mr. Levitt said the new rules would get rid of irrationality.</p>
        <p>The regulatory scrutiny comes after a series of high-profile corporate accounting frauds that auditors missed at companies including Cendant, Sunbeam and Livent. Public shareholders lost hundreds of millions of dollars in these cases, and confidence in accountants was shaken.</p>
        <p>Last January, partners and employees at PricewaterhouseCoopers were found by the S.E.C. to have routinely violated rules forbidding their ownership of stock in companies they were auditing. The investigation found 8,064 violations at the firm, which then dismissed five partners. Pricewaterhouse said at the time that it did not believe that the integrity of any audit had been compromised by the violations.</p>
        <p>The issue of auditor independence has grown thornier in recent years as accounting firms have remade themselves into full-service operations, in which auditing takes a back seat to more profitable consulting services. According to the S.E.C., auditing now represents 30 percent of accounting firms' revenue, down from 70 percent in 1977, while consulting and other advisory services represent more than half of revenue, up from 12 percent.</p>
        <p>The potential for conflict is that an auditor, eager to get consulting fees from a corporate customer, would not be as aggressive on its audit as he might otherwise be. John H. Biggs, chairman of TIAA-CREF, the pension fund management group, said that his organization makes it a rule to hire separate firms for audits and for consulting services. ''When you're paying the auditor $3 million to do an audit and paying them $17 million to do management consulting, it's way out of balance,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Laurence A. Tisch, co-chairman of the Loews Corporation, said: ''Arthur is trying to do the right thing. There's no question what he's trying to do is divorce auditing from consulting on a formal basis, and I think American business has no problem with it.''</p>
        <p>A further indication of the change that is roiling the accounting profession is KPMG's announcement last week that it planned to spin off the majority stake in its consulting services unit in an initial public offering aimed at raising $1 billion. If a KPMG auditing client owned stock in the consulting firm, a conflict could arise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levitt's call for greater power for the Oversight Board comes just a week after the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants sent a letter to the board saying that it would no longer pay to cover the board's investigation of violations of investment rules. The Public Oversight Board, headed by Charles A. Bowsher, former United States Comptroller General, is financed by 1,300 accounting firms.</p>
        <p>When asked about the letter, Mr. Anderson said it was a routine attempt ''to get our arms around a work plan for this project.''</p>
        <p>''It unfortunately got blown out of proportion,'' he said. ''We have always supported a strong oversight board, and we will continue to support it.'' But, he added, the S.E.C. should not run the oversight board.</p>
        <p>Others saw the letter as an attempt by the accounting group to stifle investigations into its member firms' conduct. After Mr. Levitt's speech yesterday, Mr. Bowsher said: ''We intend to make sure everyone understood the P.O.B. was not going to be intimidated and was not going to be pushed around here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schiro of Pricewaterhouse said: ''Funding for the P.O.B.'s special independence compliance reviews must be continued. Thwarting special reviews is contrary to the profession's interests.''</p>
