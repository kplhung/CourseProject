      <block class="full_text">
        <p>NO orchestra members will be in the pit riffling through their scores and checking their instruments when the curtain rises tonight on the New York City Technical College revival of ''Evita.''</p>
        <p>That's because 35 loudspeakers have replaced them, arranged in front of the audience where an orchestra once sat.</p>
        <p>It is those speakers, connected to a computer fully stocked with the digitally sampled sounds of a range of orchestral instruments, that will pour forth the accompaniment to ''Don't Cry for Me, Argentina'' as Evita sings her sad farewell from the stage.  Welcome to the virtual orchestra, the group that always plays on pitch and never calls for a coffee break.</p>
        <p>So while Argentina may restrain its tears, future musicians in the audience may well  weep, quietly of course, when they realize what this show and others like it could mean for their job prospects. Only the singers and actors in this production are human. The orchestra that accompanies them is entirely digital.</p>
        <p>Controlling the digital orchestra -- not from the podium but from a computer console -- will be David B. Smith, co-creator of the system and an assistant professor at New York City Technical College, which is sponsoring the performance.</p>
        <p>Dr. Smith, once a violinist himself, does not see his 100 percent simulated symphony orchestra as a threat to his former colleagues. ''We're not driving musicians out of business,'' he said. ''Our purpose is to support touring groups and small ensembles that otherwise can't afford an orchestra.''</p>
        <p>At this week's performances of ''Evita,''  at Klitgord Auditorium in Brooklyn, Dr. Smith will probably be found sitting near the stage with the score at hand; he prefers a printed version to the electronic one his computer can readily display. ''I check the score,'' he said, ''but mainly I'm looking at the conductor and the singers.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Smith will be watching to make sure that the music he is cueing keeps time with the musicians on the stage, neither getting ahead of them nor lagging behind.</p>
        <p>To do that, he will tap out a rhythm on a keyboard, the rate of which will tell the computer whether to speed up or slow down its music. At a rehearsal, he watched both the conductor and singers closely, constantly varying his electronic rhythm in response to the conductor's baton with a rubato that even Puccini, a master of the slow and fast, might envy.</p>
        <p>The speakers that emit the sound of an orchestra are arranged in a semicircle just below the stage, with one speaker dedicated to each instrument. The string section -- once wooden violas, violins and cellos -- has been replaced by 16 high-tech flat-panel speakers positioned on metal stands that put them at about nose level.</p>
        <p>''The celli are the big ones,'' Dr. Smith said, pointing to the largest of the speakers, rectangles about the size of a movie poster.  ''They are bigger because they have to get down two octaves below middle C, in the 60-hertz range.''</p>
        <p>The harpsichord that is heard in Evita's death scene shares a speaker with a piano.  Other speakers are reserved for instruments like the French horn, the oboe, the clarinet and the harp, as well as for the occasional gong and log drum.</p>
        <p>''We sample every single pitch and articulation, either live or on CD,'' said Frederick Bianchi, co-creator of the system and an associate professor and director of computer music at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. ''For instance, we have literally 8,000 or 9,000 samples of the violin created and stored.'' Dr. Bianchi is even careful to separate upbow and downbow strokes for all the stringed instruments being sampled.</p>
        <p>Drs. Smith and Bianchi have spent 15 years developing their musical system.  ''We've had 2,000 performances and never a crash,'' Dr. Bianchi said. ''Of course, we also provide a backup system just in case, but the primary system has yet to fail.''</p>
        <p>Their company, Realtime Music Solutions, offers to music directors the digitally sampled sounds, sequencing software and show files that contain the information to perform a particular score. One of the systems is currently on the road with a tour of ''Annie.'' ''The score is for 30 players,'' Dr. Smith said. ''The tour has 7 people, so we supplied the other 23 instruments.''</p>
        <p>Synthesizers are nothing new in orchestra pits, of course. Despite the best efforts of unions, they have been making steady inroads there during the last decade.</p>
        <p>Evan Johnson, a violinist who plays in the ''Beauty and the Beast'' orchestra on Broadway, opposes their incursion. He and the show's four other violinists have their sound filled out by a synthesizer at every performance.</p>
        <p>''First they take away 10 of our 15 violins,'' Mr. Johnson said, ''and then add a synthesizer, but it's not the sound of live people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson said that virtually all Broadway pits had synthesizers. ''I don't understand how any self-respecting artistic director could continue the process toward more and more synthesized music,'' he said. ''The essence of live theater is live performers. You don't go to a baseball game to see robots.''</p>
        <p>Drs. Smith and Bianchi, in contrast, are eager to make digitally sampled music available to an ever increasing audience. They particularly want to help smaller groups, like high school musicians who want to put on a play but don't have enough players for a full orchestra.</p>
        <p>''We're not saying, 'Get rid of the orchestra,' '' Dr. Bianchi said. ''We can make your seven people better. We want to enhance, not replace.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Smith said their programs offered many advantages. ''There are lots of sequencing programs, but ours is tempo agile,'' he said. ''That means the person performing the virtual orchestra has the ability to mold the music in real time, slowing down or speeding up with real expression.''</p>
        <p>Some of the equipment for the performance of ''Evita'' was purchased through a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, which is financing a program in new sound technology at the college, Dr. Smith said.</p>
        <p>The technical support staff for the performances of ''Evita'' is composed almost entirely of students training in New York City Technical College's stage technology program, preparing for the increasingly high-tech world of backstage theater. Some of the singers are professionals, others are college students.</p>
        <p>Performances of ''Evita'' with the virtual orchestra are at 8 p.m. through Saturday at the Klitgord Auditorium, at 285 Jay Street in Brooklyn (718) 260-5592. Tickets may be bought at the door.</p>
