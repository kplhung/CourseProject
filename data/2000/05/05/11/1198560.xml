        <p>Brian Jameson, a former ballet dancer, died on April 28 in Washington. He was 42 and lived in Washington.</p>
        <p>The cause was lung cancer, said Robin H. Villanueva, a friend.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jameson, a native of Hartford, studied ballet at the Hartford Conservatory and at the Academy of the Washington Ballet. He was especially associated with the Washington Ballet, dancing with it from 1976 to 1977 and again from 1981 to 1985.</p>
        <p>He also appeared with the Eliot Feld Ballet and the Princeton Ballet and as guest artist with companies in the United States and Israel. At the time of his death, he was a finance assistant with the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education.</p>
        <p>Survivors include his mother and stepfather, Geraldine B. and Alfred J. Marchand of Venice, Fla.; his father, John W. Jameson of Asheville, N.C.; a sister, Nancy Hoddy of Griswold, Conn; and two brothers, Jack Jameson of Rocky Hill, Conn., and Matthew Jameson of Orlando, Fla.</p>
