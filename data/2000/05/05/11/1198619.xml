        <p>Pat Riley and Tim Hardaway suggested to Alonzo Mourning that he shot too many long-range jumpers in Miami's 82-76 loss to the Knicks in Game 2. Then his former college coach, John Thompson, made it unanimous.</p>
        <p>Mourning had 17 points, but one of his worst shooting performances of the season, missing 13 of 18 field goals and 6 of 13 free throws.</p>
        <p>''Big John said, 'One thing I've always told you is the game is played from the inside out, and you settled for the outside yesterday,' '' a chagrined Mourning said today after the Heat's practice at LaSalle High School.</p>
        <p>''He said: 'Just think about every opportunity that you had yesterday to take the ball to the hole. Just think about all the good things to happen out of it. You score or you're fouled or somebody tips it. Or you kick it to an open player.' I know I didn't really exploit that side of my game.''</p>
        <p>Mourning promised that he would assert his 6-foot-10-inch, 261-pound body closer to the basket on Friday in Game 3 at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>''What's got me into the position I am today,'' he said, ''is taking the ball to the hole.''</p>
        <p>Mourning missed 10 straight shots from 9 minutes 59 seconds of the second quarter until 1:26 of the fourth.</p>
        <p>''I kept thinking the next shot that I took was going to fall,'' he said. ''Then the next one I take is going to fall. Then the next one -- instead of thinking, why don't I make the extra pass and get the defense moving and get a deeper spot on the weak side or get somebody wide open, based on patience and execution of the offense.''</p>
        <p>Mourning, who had 17 points over all, misfired on eight shots from beyond 13 feet and was 0 of 7 in the third quarter as the Knicks built a 9-point lead. ''I know I'm a better player than I showed yesterday -- by far,'' he said. ''It's a shame to say it took a game like this to make me realize what I need to do, because I knew it already.''</p>
        <p>Riley said: ''We've got to find a better way to get him the ball deeper. We know it. They know it.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks sometimes have put Larry Johnson on Mourning, even though Mourning is almost 6 inches taller. The Heat center knows he can almost shoot at will over Johnson.</p>
        <p>''But when it's not smart, I have to go to the next option,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mourning came into the game aware that any time he took a 15-foot or longer jump shot, he needed to make a high percentage of them.</p>
        <p>''A lot of times I get caught up in the game so much that I settle for what the defense is giving me, instead of putting more pressure on the defense,'' he said. ''But like I said, It won't happen again.''</p>
        <p>Making the game a complete bust for him offensively were the six missed free throws. He missed the first two, late in the first quarter, then botched three of his next four. Over all, the Heat missed 14 free throws, a transgression that looked pivotal in Riley's day-after assessment.</p>
        <p>''It kind of felt like I started it,'' Mourning said of the team's free-throw debacle. ''They caught the disease from me.''</p>
        <p>But Mourning didn't sound too worried that the disease will carry over to the next game.</p>
        <p>''It's not like I was actually clanking them and they were hitting the backboard and bouncing off to the side,'' he said. ''They were going in that rim, and coming back out. So it's just a matter of mechanics. It's locking my elbow, following through, getting up on my toes, getting it over the rim -- things like that.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>PAT RILEY expressed his displeasure Wednesday over Tuesday's officiating. He said of the 60 fouls in the game: ''There were at least 20 that shouldn't have been called. The game came to an absolute stop. There were so many ticky-tack fouls. I can understand the frustration on the part of the players, because they don't know what to do. When you get 60 fouls called, you're not going to get a very good game.'' Only one player, CHRIS CHILDS, fouled out.</p>
