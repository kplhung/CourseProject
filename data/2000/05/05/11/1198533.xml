        <p>A man looks within himself and finds he has lost his soul. He feels pointless, disgusted with his animal impulses, bitter, furious. He turns to others, but they abuse him or betray him. He examines authority and sees only cruelty and corruption; he cannot feel any faith. He lashes out, but that brings no satisfaction. He seeks oblivion, but stops short of suicide. In the end he decides simply to endure. If life is purgatory, at least the pain is real.</p>
        <p>No one is better than Trent Reznor at turning such desolate nihilism into arena rock. Leading his band, Nine Inch Nails, at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday night, Mr. Reznor used both brute force and finesse to bring out the shadings of torment in his songs.</p>

        <p>A man looks within himself and finds he has lost his soul. He feels pointless, disgusted with his animal impulses, bitter, furious. He turns to others, but they abuse him or betray him. He examines authority and sees only cruelty and corruption; he cannot feel any faith. He lashes out, but that brings no satisfaction. He seeks oblivion, but stops short of suicide. In the end he decides simply to endure. If life is purgatory, at least the pain is real.</p>
        <p>No one is better than Trent Reznor at turning such desolate nihilism into arena rock. Leading his band, Nine Inch Nails, at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday night, Mr. Reznor used both brute force and finesse to bring out the shadings of torment in his songs.</p>
        <p>Nine Inch Nails became one of the most influential bands of the 1990's by adding melody to the jackbooted beat, dance-music synthesizers and hard-rock guitars of industrial rock, while the words shouted the secrets of adolescent angst.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reznor's persona was a sympathetic character at the center of the onslaught, trying to stay honest even when the whole world was lined up against him. While pop's mainstream is too busy boasting and flirting to admit any insecurities, Mr. Reznor still knows where they hide.</p>
        <p>His 1999 album, ''The Fragile'' (Nothing/Interscope), is a meticulously arranged studio creation, and he did not try to reproduce it from the stage. Instead he pared down most songs to their blunt essentials: beats, keyboard riffs, power chords and his voice, howling or gasping its bleak insights. Drum machines or human muscle stomped a beat; synthesizers zapped out riffs; guitars played power chords as unswerving as granite cliffs. There were sudden, explosive crescendos and pockets of silence that were just as startling.</p>
        <p>To reflect the stark power of the music, the musicians were small figures in semidarkness, dwarfed by video screens and scaffolding and surrounded by white lights that repeatedly blasted the audience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reznor has enough hard-riffing singalongs to fill an entire set. But he also chose to play some of the more elaborate songs on ''The Fragile,'' including ''La Mer'' and ''The Great Below,'' with a long instrumental section. As majestic images of water and then flames (by the video artist Bill Viola) played above the band, the music built inexorably from a modest piano ostinato to a quiet march, without the album's effects but with its suspense; a simple drumbeat, long absent, entered like a thunderclap. It was art-rock to rival Pink Floyd or the Cure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reznor hasn't entirely given up on human fellowship. Introducing the viciously mocking song that has been retitled ''Starsuckers Inc.'' for its release as a single, he said it was about ''a friend,'' and then the friend it denounced, Marilyn Manson, joined him onstage, publicly ending a long feud. (Mr. Manson has also directed the video clip for the song.) Nine Inch Nails then backed Mr. Manson singing his own song, ''The Beautiful People''; his growl and rasp sounded crude after Mr. Reznor's finely modulated despair.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Reznor retained the last word, and it was solitary. Lighted from below to make his eye sockets look hollow, he intoned ''Hurt,'' a catalog of self-loathing. But the song ended with a quiet vow: ''If I could start again, I would find a way.''</p>
