        <p>They were supposed to be the stars of this series, the tag-team scorers who would allow the Knicks to overcome Alonzo Mourning's superiority to Patrick Ewing and whatever offensive exploits Jamal Mashburn could muster.

Just 6 of Sprewell's 25 attempts have fallen through the net, a 24 percent clip that has left him averaging 11 points a game. And Houston nullified the 21 points he scored in the Knicks' Game 1 loss by committing three turnovers in the final three minutes, then followed that by shooting 3 for 14 on Tuesday in the Knicks' Game 2 victory.</p>

        <p>They were supposed to be the stars of this series, the tag-team scorers who would allow the Knicks to overcome Alonzo Mourning's superiority to Patrick Ewing and whatever offensive exploits Jamal Mashburn could muster. But in the first two games of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Miami Heat, Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston have gained more notice for their struggles than for their skills.</p>
        <p>They are shooting the ball like role players known for defense and hustle, voiding much of the advantage in athleticism that makes the Knicks the finer team. Just 6 of Sprewell's 25 attempts have fallen through the net, a 24 percent clip that has left him averaging 11 points a game. And Houston nullified the 21 points he scored in the Knicks' Game 1 loss by committing three turnovers in the final three minutes, then followed that by shooting 3 for 14 on Tuesday in the Knicks' Game 2 victory.</p>
        <p>Yet, with their two leading weapons shrinking beneath the fire of the oppressive Heat defense, the Knicks will enter tomorrow night's Game 3 at Madison Square Garden with one victory and a pilfered home-court advantage. How's that? The Knicks would have you believe that, in a testament to their great depth, other players came through in Game 2.</p>
        <p>''Even though Latrell and I are leading the team in scoring, that doesn't mean we don't have guys that are capable, as Charlie proved last night,'' Houston said, referring to Charlie Ward. ''We're fortunate enough to have a team where we don't have to score 30 points every night.''</p>
        <p>But while Ward's 13-point performance was exceptional, it was, after all, only 13 points. Even with Ward, their oft-criticized point guard, playing above himself, the Knicks shot just 35 percent, managed only 10 assists and scored just 82 points.</p>
        <p>More than a confirmation of the Knicks' depth, Tuesday's 82-76 victory was evidence of their outstanding defense as well as Miami's offensive paralysis and horrendous foul shooting (19 for 33). If the Heat had shot well from the line, the Knicks might be staring at a 2-0 deficit.</p>
        <p>The Knicks' defense should remain constant, but it is unlikely that Miami will shoot 57 percent from the foul line again. So unless they are counting on Ward leading them in scoring every night, the Knicks need Sprewell and Houston to emerge.</p>
        <p>''Usually when me and Spree don't play well, we don't do very well as a team,'' Houston said after Tuesday's game. ''This night was out of the ordinary.''</p>
        <p>It has been an extraordinary defensive scheme that has kept Sprewell and Houston down. First, Miami's perimeter defenders are playing them tenaciously. Mashburn has used his 6-foot-8-inch, 240-pound frame to bump the slight Sprewell and keep him from backing toward the basket, eliminating a key part of Sprewell's arsenal. And the burly Dan Majerle and the wiry Bruce Bowen have smothered Houston, who is used to playing against smaller shooting guards. Majerle has used his huge arms to knock Houston out of his groove, and Bowen is long enough and moves well enough to swarm him.</p>
        <p>''You have to give them credit, they've done a good job, not just on team defense, but individually,'' Chris Childs said of the Heat guards. ''Majerle don't get enough respect. He's a heck of a defensive player. They let him grab and hold, and he does whatever he can to stop those guys.''</p>
        <p>That said, Sprewell can blow past the slower Mashburn, and Houston can easily beat Majerle off the dribble. But after one bounce of the ball, one or two Heat defenders fly in to help their teammate. That has often left Sprewell and Houston surrounded by the opposition and staring at the menacing Mourning or the athletic P. J. Brown once they break into the paint. Mourning, the league's shot-block leader, rejected four shots on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''The biggest thing that they do better than Toronto is that they make it difficult on you when you get past one guy,'' said Sprewell, who ran roughshod over Toronto's defense in the first two games of their first-round series. ''They have Zo in there and more size. And it's not just one guy. They've got four or five guys in that paint area. They do a good job of clogging that area up.''</p>
        <p>Houston said: ''We're still going to attack. I don't care whether I get my shot blocked three or four times. Alonzo's the leading shot-blocker, but you can't get discouraged if he blocks a shot. That's like someone getting discouraged if I make a jump shot.''</p>
        <p>With Heat players sprinting at him at every turn, Sprewell, who at times was double-teamed in the corner, was afforded no breathing room.</p>
        <p>''I think Riley was out there, too,'' Childs said, referring to Miami Coach Pat Riley. Unlike Houston, who had his moments in Game 1, Sprewell has been in an offensive dry spell since the final game of the Toronto series, scoring 11 points in each of the past three contests. Double-teamed much of the time, he has shot 28 percent (10 for 36) over that span.</p>
        <p>''We've got to get more transition buckets,'' Childs said, presenting a solution to the struggles of Sprewell and Houston. ''We've got to get those guys down the floor before the defense can set up, because once they set up they're focused on taking the ball out of those guys' hands.''</p>
        <p>Sprewell said he was not bothered by his slump. ''Because we've won two of those games, and we had a shot at winning the other,'' Sprewell said. ''It's not about what I can do individually. We'd all love to go out and play as well as we could every night, but reality is that it's not going to be that way all the time. So you just have to deal with it and not get your head down and remember what the ultimate goal is -- winning a championship.''</p>
