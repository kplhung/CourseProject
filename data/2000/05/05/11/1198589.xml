        <p>A 24-year-old Japanese woman who worked as a music promoter was fatally shot early yesterday morning as she walked home on a quiet Queens street, the police said.</p>
        <p>The woman, Ryoko Chosa, who was from Nagano, Japan, was found about 3:15 a.m. on the sidewalk outside 87-59 52nd Avenue in Elmhurst, about a block from her home, the police said. Ms. Chosa was found after several neighbors were awakened by gunshots and called the police.</p>
        <p>The young woman, who had majored in Spanish and Latin American affairs and, according to one of her professors, had hoped to work as a translator at the United Nations, had been shot in the face, the neck and the stomach, the police said. She was taken to Elmhurst General Hospital, where she died about 5 a.m., the police said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Chosa's killer left behind her watch and her large black purse  containing her wallet, and police detectives said they were unsure of the motive for the killing. ''We're seeking to determine if robbery was the motive or if the young woman was killed by someone known to her,'' said Richard Brown, the Queens district attorney.</p>
        <p>Detectives from the 110th Precinct and the Queens Homicide Squad, who are investigating the killing, spoke with the woman's family in Japan, who said they did not know whether Ms. Chosa had been seeing anyone, a police official said.</p>
        <p>The murder shattered the calm of the middle-class neighborhood of three-story brick row houses and single-family homes, where many Asian families live. Jee Choe, 20, said that he and his girlfriend moved to the neighborhood because they thought it was safe, but that now they were not so sure. ''It worries me now, especially for my girlfriend, that something like this could happen around here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Chosa had worked since December for YWA Music in SoHo,  where her responsibilities included helping to promote Japanese bands in Latin America and in the United States, the authorities said. Calls to the office were not returned yesterday.</p>
        <p>She graduated in April 1999 from Flagler College, a small liberal arts school in St. Augustine, Fla.</p>
        <p>An energetic and dedicated student with a ready smile, she impressed her teachers and classmates  because she had to study twice as hard as some of her peers to master English so that she could then master Spanish, said a spokeswoman for the school, Laurin Bosse.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dawn Wiles, the head of the college's Spanish Language/Latin American Studies Department, said in a statement issued by Ms. Bosse, ''I think that anybody who knew her admired her so much because she undertook such a difficult program of studies.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Chosa had spent the evening before she was killed at the Limelight, a nightclub in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>She lived in a room on the second floor of a small house around the corner from where she was killed, the police said. The house was divided into five rooms that shared a kitchen and a bathroom, and most of the residents were Japanese, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The 110th Precinct, which covers parts of Corona and Jackson Heights in addition to Elmhurst, was ranked 51st of the city's 76 precincts in 1999 with six killings. Ms. Chosa's slaying was the third this year in the precinct, where reported crime is down 14.9 percent compared with the first four months of last year.</p>
