        <p>Manhattan divorce lawyers said yesterday that separation agreements, like the one to be sought by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, could be crucial in establishing privacy, protecting children and negotiating financial matters.</p>
        <p>They also can help to set the terms of separation quickly; they effectively dissolve a marriage, while a divorce can take years.</p>
        <p>Celebrity divorces -- where the partners are as well known as the mayor and his wife, Donna Hanover -- are sometimes negotiated in the press by lawyers trying to leverage public opinion, a strategy that can be devastating to children, said Pamela Sloan, a partner at Flemming, Zulack &amp; Williamson.</p>
        <p>Harold A. Mayerson, a fellow of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, said legal separations could stipulate there be no public discussion of private matters, and could impose penalties for violations.</p>
        <p>To increase privacy and minimize litigation, he added, they can also designate third-party mediators like priests or pediatricians to help decide matters affecting children.</p>
        <p>Legal separations can also include a resolution of financial matters, including future earnings. Lawyers said that while the mayor could significantly increase his income after his term ends in 2001, a settlement now could avoid disputes later.  THE MAYOR'S SEPARATION</p>
