        <p>Last fall the Joffrey Ballet School and the New School University united in a pedagogical pas de deux by establishing a Bachelor of Arts degree program that allows ballet students seeking professional training to receive a liberal arts education while they continue to study dance.</p>
        <p>The first public presentation by this Joffrey Ballet School/New School University B.F.A. Program, as the project is known, took place on Monday night. Called ''Copland and Dance,'' and performed to recorded music by Aaron Copland, it honored the centennial of the birth of this composer who taught at the New School in the late 20's.</p>
        <p>Although the Joffrey Ballet company gave up its New York headquarters in 1995 and moved to Chicago, where it is thriving, the Joffrey Ballet School remains in Greenwich Village not far from the New School. The New York institutions' partnership seems promising, both academically and artistically.</p>
        <p>The evening's choreographically strongest pieces were excerpts from two major ballets composed by Copland: Agnes de Mille's ''Rodeo'' and Eugene Loring's ''Billy the Kid.'' It was unfortunate that the program did not indicate that these presentations were snippets. Dancegoers unfamiliar with the works might have been mystified by what they saw.</p>
        <p>Yet the final scene from ''Rodeo'' was danced with verve, with Anna Kreager as an appealingly wistful Cowgirl and Keelan Whitmore and Matthew Prescott as the two cowboys who become attracted to her. The sense of spontaneity that enlivened ''Rodeo'' was missing from ''Billy the Kid.'' As Billy, Charles Edward Connolly looked very self-conscious in a brooding solo and in his duet with Alison Dubsky, who symbolized a vision of both the outlaw's mother and his sweetheart. But these dancers' obvious conscientiousness was admirable.</p>
        <p>Three plotless works were offered. Kathryn Posin, who heads this new ballet program, sent a large cast rushing through ''Concerto for Piano and Orchestra.'' Trinette Singleton's ''On the Wings of Music'' emphasized clarity of phrasing. And John Magnus's ''Short Symphony'' challenged its dancers with speedy shifts of position. Yet these ballets were more interesting for their displays of technique than for any complex patterns or emotional evocations.</p>
        <p>Vivian Perlis, a music historian and a biographer of Copland, spoke briefly about him, calling attention to his abiding love of dance and praising his musical ''honesty, integrity and humor.''</p>
