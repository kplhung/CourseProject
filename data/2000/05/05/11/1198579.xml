        <p>Following are excerpts from documents filed yesterday in Federal District Court in Washington by the Microsoft Corporation in response to last month's proposal by the government to split the company in two:</p>
        <p>MICROSOFT'S MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION FOR SUMMARY REJECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT'S BREAKUP</p>
        <p>PROPOSAL</p>
        <p>As a matter of law, the Court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law do not justify the government's radical request to split Microsoft into two separate companies -- what the government euphemistically refers to as a simple ''reorganization.'' That the government would request such structural relief is particularly inappropriate given the manner in which the case was tried. The Court dramatically accelerated the trial of this action, and consolidated it with the hearing on the government's motion for a preliminary injunction, in part because the final relief requested by the government in its complaint was essentially the same as the relief requested in its preliminary injunction motion. That relief dealt primarily with distribution of Netscape's Web browsing software, the crux of the case the government brought. Now, in stark contrast to the relief sought in its complaint, the government seeks to rip apart the company that until recently had the largest market capitalization in the world -- an extreme remedy not even hinted at in the government's complaint. The law and the facts do not support such a radical step.</p>
        <p>1.  The evidence at trial did not establish, and the Court did not find, a clear causal link between the conduct held to be anticompetitive and Microsoft's current market position. The government has never contended here or in any other case that Microsoft obtained its market position unlawfully. To the contrary, the government's own economist in 1995, Nobel Laureate Kenneth J. Arrow of Stanford University, acknowledged that Microsoft ''achieved its dominant position in its market as a consequence of good fortune and possibly superior product and business acumen.'' Nor did this Court find that, but for the conduct held to be anticompetitive in this case, Microsoft would have lost its leading position in Intel-compatible PC operating systems -- in fact, the Court expressly disavowed such a finding. Given the absence of a proven causal connection between the conduct found to be anticompetitive and Microsoft's continued leading position in operating systems, the only appropriate remedy is an injunction against continuation of such conduct. The record in this case simply does not support the government's efforts to dismember Microsoft and reshape the software industry in a speculative effort to weaken Microsoft's market position.</p>
        <p>2.  Courts are not authorized in civil enforcement proceedings to punish antitrust defendants. Instead, relief may extend no farther than is necessary to redress the conduct found to be unlawful. Even the government acknowledges that ''the remedy must be reasonably related to the wrong.'' Enjoining Microsoft from conduct held to be anticompetitive would redress all of the antitrust violations found by the Court. As a result, there is no basis to split Microsoft into separate companies with all the attendant risks, costs and complexities.</p>
        <p>3.  The extreme remedy proposed by the government is particularly inappropriate given the unsettled legal standards applicable to the government's claims. The conduct that was the cornerstone of the government's case -- Microsoft's inclusion of Web browsing software in Windows -- was not clearly barred by the Sherman Act under existing case law. Although this Court has now concluded that Microsoft's design of Windows violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, the Court acknowledged that the Court of Appeals and a number of other courts have articulated a different standard for ''technological tying.'' Under this more deferential standard, Microsoft's conduct did not violate the Sherman Act. In fact, the Court expressly stated that its conclusion that Microsoft is liable for unlawful tying ''is arguably at variance with a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in a closely related case.'' Under controlling Supreme Court precedent, conduct that could reasonably have been thought permissible at the time it occurred calls for a more lenient remedy under the Sherman Act.</p>
        <p>4.  The public has reaped substantial benefits from Microsoft's development of Windows and other software products. Many of these benefits would not have been possible but for Microsoft's unified structure, which enables Microsoft to conceive and implement new ideas that span operating systems and applications. There can be no dispute that Microsoft has played a leading role in the personal computer revolution that has helped fuel this country's unprecedented economic growth. As the government's own experts admit, no one can predict with any degree of reliability what effects the government's breakup proposal will have on the two resulting companies, the software industry or the Nation's economy. Indeed, much of the government's submission on remedies is based on sheer speculation. For example, Ernest von Simson states in a three-page declaration without any empirical support that his ''personal view'' is that ''structural separation'' of Microsoft into separate companies ''would increase competition and innovation'' and ''would not cause significant inconvenience to large enterprises.'' Such musings hardly provide a legal justification for ripping Microsoft apart.</p>
        <p>5.  No court has ever ordered significant structural relief in a contested case where the defendant obtained its leading market position through internal growth rather than through acquiring its rivals. The fact that no court has ordered the breakup of a unitary company like Microsoft demonstrates the extreme nature of the relief requested by the government. Even two of the plaintiffs in this case -- Illinois and Ohio -- agree that the government's breakup proposal is unwarranted.</p>
        <p>In the cases of AT&amp;T and Standard Oil, the defendants were a regulated holding company and a trust, respectively, that had separate operating units (often obtained through acquisitions) that could be separated from one another without massive disruption. In contrast, Microsoft does not have free-standing operating units devoted to particular regions or types of products -- it has one headquarters, one set of sales and marketing subsidiaries around the world, one sales and marketing force, one product support organization, one basic research unit, one finance department, etc. In addition, because its business is based on intellectual property, Microsoft's most important assets are its people, who may leave the company in droves if draconian structural relief is imposed. Contrary to the government's blithe suggestion, a breakup of Microsoft would be hopelessly complex and difficult to administer.</p>
        <p>For these reasons, which are discussed in more detail below, Microsoft respectfully requests that the Court summarily reject the government's proposal to split Microsoft into two separate companies. By rejecting forthwith the government's improper request for structural relief, the Court will spare itself and the parties the burden of extended proceedings addressing a remedy that cannot be imposed here as a matter of law.</p>
        <p>Microsoft also should not be forced to suffer the disruption to its business that will inevitably result from having the threat of a breakup hang over its head like the sword of Damocles while this Court conducts proceedings on remedies. Not only may Microsoft lose irreplaceable employees, but third parties may be unwilling to enter into routine business agreements with Microsoft while its continued corporate existence remains in doubt.</p>
        <p>PROPOSED FINAL JUDGMENT</p>
        <p>4. OEM License Agreements Microsoft is enjoined from:</p>
        <p>a.  canceling or refusing to grant a License Agreement to any OEM because the OEM ships or promotes non-Microsoft Platform Software or exercises any of the options provided in paragraph 4.b of this Decree, provided that the OEM does not infringe Microsoft's Intellectual Property Rights in exercising those options;</p>
        <p>b.  entering into any License Agreement or asserting any claim of right under copyright law that would prohibit any OEM from:</p>
        <p>(i)  displaying icons for non-Microsoft Platform Software on the Windows Operating System desktop (provided that the icons do not cover the whole or any part of the icons supplied by Microsoft),</p>
        <p>(ii)  offering its own Internet sign-up process in the initial boot sequence of the Windows Operating System that includes the option to make non-Microsoft Web browsing software the Default Browser on a new Personal Computer and to remove the Internet Explorer icon from the Windows Operating System desktop if the end user elects to make non-Microsoft Web browsing software the Default Browser,</p>
        <p>(iii)  deleting the Internet Explorer icon from the Windows Operating System desktop and Start menu in copies of Windows Operating Systems that the OEM pre-installs on its new Personal Computers, or</p>
        <p>(iv)  configuring non-Microsoft Web browsing software as the Default Browser on Personal Computers sold by the OEM;</p>
        <p>provided that nothing in paragraph 4.b shall be interpreted to limit Microsoft's ability to develop, and license to OEMs, Operating Systems that invoke Web browsing functionality built into such products to display (a) information presented in the Operating System itself (e.g., Help files), (b) information presented in Web sites that enhance the functionality of the Operating System (e.g., Windows Update), or (c) Web pages transmitted over the Internet or an intranet that the content provider has developed in a manner that requires such Web browsing functionality for the content to be displayed properly or at all;</p>
        <p>c.  terminating the License Agreement of any of the 20 largest OEMs (as measured by annual volume of Windows Operating Systems that they ship) without having first given the OEM written notice of the reason for the proposed termination and not less than 30 days' opportunity to cure.</p>
        <p>5. Promotion on the Windows Operating System Desktop</p>
        <p>Microsoft is enjoined from entering into a contract in which Microsoft agrees to promote any product or service of the other party to the contract on the Windows Operating System desktop, in a folder on the Windows Operating System desktop, in the Active Desktop or in the initial boot sequence of the Windows Operating System in exchange for the other party's agreeing to limit the amount of any non-Microsoft Platform Software distributed by that party.</p>
        <p>6. ISVs' Access to Technical Information  Microsoft is enjoined from:</p>
        <p>a.  denying any bona fide ISV timely and complete access to such Technical Information as is provided through any software development program that Microsoft makes available to the software development community at large to assist in the creation of applications for Windows Operating Systems, subject to space limitations (in the case of events like design previews and professional developers conferences) and to the ISV's complying with normal and customary terms (such as payment of applicable fees and observance of conditions protecting Microsoft's Intellectual Property Rights); and</p>
        <p>b.  in the event that Microsoft furnishes Technical Information to an ISV in addition to that referred to in paragraph 6.a, conditioning the release of such Technical Information on the ISV's agreeing not to write Platform Software, or applications for such Platform Software, that compete with any Microsoft software, provided that Microsoft may condition the release of Technical Information to an ISV on the ISV's agreeing not to infringe any of Microsoft's Intellectual Property Rights and agreeing to commercially reasonable measures (including reasonable confidentiality agreements) for protection of such rights.</p>
        <p>7. Release of Products for Non-Microsoft Platform Software</p>
        <p>Microsoft is enjoined from conditioning the timely release of a software product that is designed to run on non-Microsoft Platform Software and that is ready for commercial release on an agreement by the vendor of that Platform Software to limit the development, manufacture, distribution or promotion of Platform Software that competes with Platform Software offered by Microsoft.</p>
        <p>8. Licensing of Predecessor Operating Systems</p>
        <p>Microsoft shall, when it releases a major Windows Operating System such as Windows 95 or Windows 98, continue for three years to make the predecessor Windows Operating System available for licensing at a royalty no higher than the existing royalty to any OEM that desires such a license.</p>
        <p>9. Effective Date</p>
        <p>Microsoft shall begin to comply with the provisions of this Decree within 45 days of its entry, provided that Microsoft may seek a stay of this Decree pending any appeal of this Court's judgment.</p>
        <p>10. Monitoring of Compliance  To determine or secure compliance with this Decree, duly authorized representatives of the plaintiffs shall, upon written request of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, on reasonable notice given to Microsoft at its principal office, subject to any lawful privilege, be permitted:</p>
        <p>a.  access during normal office hours to inspect and copy all books, ledgers, accounts, correspondence, memoranda and other documents and records in the possession, custody or control of Microsoft (which may have counsel present) relating to any matters contained in this Decree;</p>
        <p>b.  subject to the reasonable convenience of Microsoft and without restraint or interference from it, to interview officers, employees or agents of Microsoft (who may have counsel present) regarding any matters contained in this Decree; and</p>
        <p>c.  to require Microsoft to submit written reports, under oath if requested, regarding any matters contained in this Decree.</p>
        <p>No information or documents obtained by the means provided in this paragraph shall be divulged by any of the plaintiffs except in the course of legal proceedings to which one or more of the plaintiffs is a party, or for the purpose of securing compliance with this Decree, or as otherwise required by law. Nor shall anything in this paragraph require Microsoft to waive any applicable privilege or immunity, including, without limitation, the attorney-client privilege and work product protection. . . .</p>
        <p>11. Costs and Attorneys' Fees  Microsoft shall pay the plaintiff states' reasonable costs and attorneys' fees.</p>
        <p>12. Term  This Decree shall terminate four years from its effective date. Until termination, jurisdiction over this case is retained for the purpose of enabling any of the parties to apply to this Court at any time for such further orders and directions as may be appropriate for the correction, construction or carrying out of this Decree, for the earlier termination of the Decree, or to set aside the Decree and to conduct further proceedings if future developments justify that course in the appropriate enforcement of the Sherman Act.</p>
        <p>MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PROPOSED FINAL JUDGMENT</p>
        <p>Microsoft's proposed final judgment fully redresses the conduct found by the Court to be anticompetitive. Unlike the government's requested relief, Microsoft's proposal is based on the evidence received at trial and the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of the Law entered by the Court. As Microsoft explains in its other submissions today, with (i) no proof of a casual link between Microsoft's conduct and its current market position, (ii) Microsoft's reasonable belief that the conduct at the core of the government's case was legal at the time it occurred, and (iii) Microsoft's significant contributions to consumer welfare and this Nation's economy, the remedy imposed here must be focused and not punitive.</p>
        <p>1. OEM License Agreements  Paragraph 4 of Microsoft's proposal addresses the Court's conclusion that Microsoft improperly induced OEMs to distribute Internet Explorer rather than Netscape Navigator and did not give OEMs sufficient latitude to modify Windows. Paragraphs 4.a and c of the proposal would ensure that Microsoft will not cancel or refuse to grant a Windows license agreement to an OEM because the OEM ships or promotes non-Microsoft platform software and that, before canceling any of the top twenty OEMs' license agreements, Microsoft would give the OEM thirty days' written notice and an opportunity to cure any breach.</p>
        <p>Paragraph 4.b would ensure that OEMs are free to include on the Windows desktop as many icons for non-Microsoft platform software as they like, thus permitting OEMs to promote and distribute competing platform software. Under Microsoft's proposal, the icons added by OEMs could be of any shape or size that the OEM wants so long as the OEM's icons do not cover any of the icons supplied by Microsoft.</p>
        <p>Paragraph 4.b also directly addresses the Court's concerns about OEMs' ability to modify Windows to promote competing Web browsing software -- a central issue in this case. In particular, this paragraph would ensure that OEMs can (i) offer end users ''browser choice'' during the initial Windows boot sequence, (ii) remove the Internet Explorer icon from the Windows desktop and Start menu, and (iii) configure non-Microsoft Web browsing software to be the ''default browser'' on the personal computers they sell. Accordingly, paragraph 4.b fully redresses the Court's finding that Microsoft prevented OEMs from removing the ready means of accessing Internet Explorer and from promoting Netscape Navigator during the initial Windows boot sequence.</p>
        <p>Paragraph 4.b also addresses the Court's conclusion that Microsoft violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by tying Internet Explorer to Windows. It does so in a manner consistent with the approach advocated by the government and its experts, namely, removal of the predominant means of access to Internet Explorer rather than removal of the software code in Windows that provides Web browsing functionality. As the Court recognized, the latter approach is unworkable because it would result in the removal of APIs on which third-party software developers rely. By providing OEMs with the ability to remove the Internet Explorer icon, offer ''browser choice'' during the initial Windows boot sequence and configure non-Microsoft Web browsing software to be the ''default browser,'' Microsoft's proposed remedy affords OEMs complete flexibility to distribute and promote any Web browsing software they choose, while at the same time protecting the integrity of Windows as a stable and consistent platform for software development.</p>
        <p>2. Promotion on the Windows Desktop  Paragraph 5 of Microsoft's proposal addresses the Court's conclusion that Microsoft improperly induced IAPs to distribute and promote Internet Explorer rather than Netscape Navigator, as well as the Court's concerns about Microsoft's dealings with ICPs. Specifically, paragraph 5 responds to the Court's finding that Microsoft's agreements with ICPs, ISPs and OLSs improperly traded promotion on the Windows desktop for third parties' agreement to limit their distribution of competing Web browsing software-another central issue in this case. This paragraph would prohibit Microsoft from agreeing to promote another party's product or service on the Windows desktop itself or in a folder on the Windows desktop in exchange for that party's agreement to limit in any way its distribution of non-Microsoft platform software.</p>
        <p>In addition to these provisions, which address the Court's conclusions with respect to the OEM and IAP channels and tying, Microsoft has included in its proposed final judgment a number of prophylactic provisions that relate to other issues in this case.</p>
        <p>1. ISVs' Access to Technical Information  Paragraph 6 of Microsoft's proposal would ensure that ISVs have timely access to the APIs needed to write Windows applications. Specifically, paragraph 6.a would ensure that any bona fide ISV has access to all technical information that Microsoft provides to ISVs generally to assist in the creation of Windows applications. And paragraph 6.b would prohibit Microsoft, in the event that it furnishes technical information to an ISV in addition to that referred to in paragraph 6.a, from conditioning the release of such technical information on that ISV's agreement not to write platform software or applications for non-Microsoft platform software. Paragraph 6 therefore addresses the Court's apparent concerns regarding Microsoft's dealings with ISVs, including Microsoft's dealings with Netscape prior to the release of Windows 95.</p>
        <p>2. Release of Products for Non-Microsoft Platforms  Paragraph 7 of Microsoft's proposal addresses the Court's conclusion that Microsoft's agreements with Apple ''diminished the usage of Navigator on the Mac OS.'' This paragraph would prohibit Microsoft from conditioning the timely release of a software product designed to run on a non-Microsoft platform (such as Mac Office) and ready for commercial release on an agreement by the vendor of the competing platform to limit its development, manufacture, distribution or promotion of non-Microsoft platform software.</p>
        <p>3. Licensing of Predecessor Operating Systems  Paragraph 8 of Microsoft's proposal would require Microsoft, after the release of a major Windows operating system such as Windows 98 or Windows 2000 Professional, to continue to license the predecessor operating system at a royalty not higher than the existing royalty for three years. This provision therefore would permit OEMs to pre-install such operating systems on their computers if they do not like the features and functionality of Microsoft's new operating systems. Like paragraph 4.b, this paragraph would address the Court's conclusion that Microsoft unlawfully tied Internet Explorer to Windows. . . .</p>
        <p>4. Term &amp; Monitoring of Compliance  Microsoft's proposed final judgment also includes appropriate provisions regarding the term of the decree and the means by which the government can monitor Microsoft's compliance. First, paragraph 12 of Microsoft's proposal provides that the decree will terminate four years from its effective date. In contrast, under the government's proposal, the decree would remain in force for ten years (assuming the Court rejects the government's breakup proposal). Nothing in the record justifies such a lengthy term for relief in this case. Most of the conduct challenged by the government occurred over a two-  or three-year period, and much of that conduct stopped long ago.</p>
        <p>Given the lightening pace at which the software industry moves, Microsoft's proposed term of four years is reasonable. No one can predict with reasonable certainty what effect the government's proposed relief would have on Microsoft and the software industry today. Indeed, the government's own experts equivocate, declining make such a prediction. To impose stringent restrictions on Microsoft that would apply for more than four years is unnecessary and would risk impeding technological advancement in ways that cannot now be anticipated.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's proposed final judgment also would provide the government with sufficient means to determine and secure compliance with the Court's judgment. . . .</p>
        <p>In contrast, the rights of access sought by the government are unreasonably broad and not limited to ensuring compliance with the Court's judgment. Indeed, the government seeks authority to conduct perpetual, essentially unbounded, investigations of Microsoft, without any of the protections to which Microsoft would otherwise be entitled under the law.</p>
        <p>POSITION AS TO FUTURE PROCEEDINGS ON REMEDY</p>
        <p>In its proposed final judgment, the government has asked the Court to break Microsoft up and then actively regulate the two resulting companies, impairing their ability to develop new products for consumers in the highly competitive software industry. As Microsoft explains in its memorandum in support of summary rejection of the government's breakup proposal, such radical relief is unprecedented and wholly inappropriate given the antitrust violations found by the Court -- which relate principally to Microsoft's development and distribution of Web browsing software in competition with Netscape. Should the Court not summarily reject the government's breakup proposal, then substantial discovery, adequate time for preparation and a full trial on relief will be required.</p>
        <p>In addition to its attempt to rip apart Microsoft's integrated operations, the government seeks to impose other relief that, although characterized as a ''disclosure remedy,'' would constitute a wholesale confiscation of Microsoft's intellectual property -- the company's crown jewels. Microsoft has spent billions of dollars creating operating systems like Windows 2000 and Windows 98, and it is entitled to the fruits of those research and development efforts. It is not a proper purpose of the remedy in this case to enable leading software companies like IBM, AOL/Netscape, Novell, Oracle and Sun Microsystems to appropriate Microsoft's inventions and innovations free of charge.</p>
        <p>If the Court intends to consider giving Microsoft's competitors open access to Microsoft's enormously valuable intellectual property -- by requiring Microsoft to disclose the inner workings of its operating systems as well as other proprietary information such as codecs, file formats and protocols -- then substantial time for preparation and a lengthy evidentiary hearing will still be required. There can be no rush to judgment granting such unprecedented relief in light of the importance of the interests at stake, and the government has offered no justification for highly expedited procedures in seeking to impose its requested relief.</p>
        <p>The need for deliberate procedures is especially strong because much of the intellectual property the government seeks to confiscate relates to products and technologies, such as Windows 2000, that were not even mentioned at trial. (As the Court is aware, Windows 2000 is the successor product to Windows NT 4.0, not Windows 9x.) There is no evidence in the record to support a de facto taking of these products and technologies, and if the Court intends to consider such draconian relief, Microsoft is entitled to address these new issues fully and deliberately.</p>
        <p>Even if the Court rejects both the government's proposed breakup and confiscation of Microsoft's intellectual property, the remaining ''conduct'' relief requested by the government -- which includes several provisions regulating the design of Microsoft's operating system software -- is severe and unwarranted in the circumstances. . . .</p>
