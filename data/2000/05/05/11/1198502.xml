        <p>Urban Lichens</p>
        <p>Q. While walking in the woods behind my parents' home in Maine, I became fascinated by the profusion of lichen forms along the trail. They looked like structures one might find in the sea -- sea fans, corals and algae. They varied in color from light green to brown and were stiff, yet not brittle. I gathered up a small example of each and brought them home to my New York apartment. I have done a little research and find that they are the symbiotic association of a fungus and algae, which grows very, very slowly. What I can't find is any information about how to keep them alive. When I spray them with water, they become soft and pliable, but I am not sure if my samples are still alive. If they are alive, is there any chance of keeping them alive in my vastly different environment, or should I send them home?</p>
        <p>A. Send them home: they miss the woods. The relationship between the algae, which provide the fungus with carbohydrates through their own photosynthesis, and the fungus, which provides the algae with water, protection and a place to live, is based on a very delicate balance of light and moisture. If the balance is upset, one or the other may die, or one may grow faster than the other. Either way, the lichen -- the combination of the two -- won't be able to survive. A lot of interesting things grow in New York apartments, but lichens aren't among them.</p>

        <p>Scatter and Stand Back</p>
        <p>Q. Many years ago I used to see advertisements for a wildflower seed mixture. The promise was that just scattering the seed would create a meadow. Is this still being sold? Does it really work?</p>
        <p>A. Instant meadows are still being sold, and people are still scattering seeds and dreaming. Predictably, the results are proportional to the amount of work, not the amount of dreaming.</p>
        <p>These seed mixtures are made up primarily of annuals, which will bloom (and die) the summer the area is seeded, assuming the seeds land on bare soil and germinate and grow in the face of stiff competition from weeds.</p>
        <p>To get a meadow instead of a random sprinkling of flowers, you'll have to kill and remove any plants already growing on the site. Lightly open up the bare soil with a steel rake, spread the flower seeds evenly, use a roller for good seed-to-soil contact and lightly mulch with weed-free hay or straw to retain moisture and keep the birds from finding all the seed. Keep it moist, pull up a chair and enjoy the summer riot of color. Unfortunately, the following spring you'll find that many of the annuals didn't re-seed themselves enough to prevent fall's weed seeds from taking hold. So you start all over again. An annual meadow is an annual job.</p>
        <p>There is a better plan. After preparing the site, use a native perennial wildflower and a grass mixture designed for your area (not the turf variety; use grasses like the three-foot-tall, clump-forming little blue stem). Each year the plants grow more roots, eventually forming an interwoven mass that chokes out annual weeds.</p>
        <p>There simply are no instant, maintenance-free meadows. It takes two or three years before most of the perennial plants will reach blooming size. The meadow should be mowed or burned (check with your fire department to see that it is legal) each fall or before spring growth begins. While the lilies of the field may not toil, those who put them there sure have to.</p>
        <p>Sources for perennial meadow seed mixtures include Ernst Conservation Seeds, 9006 Mercer Pike, Meadville, Pa. 16335, (800) 873-3321; and Prairie Nursery, P.O. Box 306, Westfield, Wis. 53964, (800) 476-9453. Both have free lists of mixtures.</p>
        <p>Address questions to Garden Q.&amp; A., The New York Times, 229 West 43rd Street, New York 10036, or by e-mail to gardening@nytimes .com. Those of general interest will be published. Unpublished questions cannot be answered individually.</p>
