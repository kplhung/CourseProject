        <p>New Jersey's fiscal oversight agency today formally took over the financial operation of Camden, the state's poorest city and one that has for years,  over several mayoral administrations, defied efforts by the state to correct fiscal abuses.</p>
        <p>Camden's municipal lawyers complained halfheartedly that the state, too, was to blame for the city's ills. But the Local Finance Board, an arm of the Department of Community Affairs, brushed those objections aside.

        <p>New Jersey's fiscal oversight agency today formally took over the financial operation of Camden, the state's poorest city and one that has for years,  over several mayoral administrations, defied efforts by the state to correct fiscal abuses.</p>
        <p>Camden's municipal lawyers complained halfheartedly that the state, too, was to blame for the city's ills. But the Local Finance Board, an arm of the Department of Community Affairs, brushed those objections aside. Instead, it voted without dissent to invoke a Depression-era state law that allows the state to assume supervision of cities that demonstrate a high level of mismanagement, including recurring deficits, and that fail to fully collect taxes because of that mismanagement.</p>
        <p>More than 70 percent of Camden's income is derived from state aid, and its managers have for years been found by state investigators to have failed to keep coherent fiscal records, while engaging in questionable spending.</p>
        <p>This spring, Camden's mayor, Milton Milan, was indicted under federal racketeering and corruption laws, becoming the city's third mayor in 20 years to be indicted. The federal action, part of a continuing investigation into mob influences in Camden and Philadelphia, spurred New Jersey officials to take a harder stand on Camden's management style.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Judge Francis J. Orlando Jr. of Superior Court ruled that Camden met the standard for state supervision, and today Jane M. Kenny, commissioner of the Community Affairs Department, told the Local Finance Board that it was time to act.</p>
        <p>''The court has recognized that the state needs to have a more direct role in the city's operation,'' she said. ''We stand ready to take a proactive approach to managing the city's finances and setting the city on a course of economic recovery.''</p>
        <p>Al Steinberg, chairman of the Local Finance Board, said state auditors would spend the next few weeks ''surveying the landscape'' of Camden's fiscal condition, including reviewing staffing levels and personnel qualifications, and determining whether any current fiscal managers need to be replaced or new ones hired. The law gives the state one year to complete its supervision.</p>
        <p>East Orange is the only other city now under state supervision, and the state was all but welcomed there by Mayor Robert L. Bowser, a civil engineer who was elected in 1997 in a campaign to reform the city. The mayor said in a recent interview that  his city had to get state approval for any spending over $4,500, and that the state moved swiftly to pare the city payrolls.</p>
        <p>''They've laid off about 70 people, which saves us $455,000 this year and about $1.7 million next year,'' Mayor Bowser said.</p>
        <p>In contrast to East Orange officials, Camden's leaders have fought Trenton's takeover at each step.</p>
