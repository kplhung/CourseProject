        <p>WHETHER your travels take you to another city or another continent, it helps to know something about your destination: where to eat, where to stay or what to see. In the past, that meant taking along travel or restaurant guides and a pocket diary for keeping track of travel arrangements, appointments, reservations, torn pages from directories, maps and other bits of travel-related data.</p>
        <p>Now you can carry all that information on a computer. And although a laptop can make a handy travel companion, the smaller, handheld personal digital assistants are even more convenient.</p>
        <p>With pocket-size handhelds, there are basically two choices: devices running the Palm operating system, like Palm's own handhelds or the Handspring Visor, and those from Casio, Compaq and Hewlett-Packard, which use Microsoft's Windows CE operating system or its newer, more capable successor, Pocket PC. Just as the Palm camp has a lead of many millions of units over the Microsoft faction, Palm and its cousins also have the edge in travel products.</p>
        <p>There is a lot of travel information available for handhelds, which is useful even if your idea of traveling involves nothing more than a trip to a new neighborhood in search of an exotic meal. The publishers of popular travel and entertainment guidebooks have a presence on the Web, and some have adapted their products to the handheld market. From Fodor's to Frommer's, Lonely Planet to Zagat, the guides served up by these brand names for online or handheld use generally match their printed counterparts in tone, style and content.</p>
        <p>Travelers loyal to any of the guides can visit their Web sites for products, services and online addendums to the printed editions. Users must pay to download some information, but all offer some free online-based services and listings that can be saved to a P.D.A. as a text file or Web page.</p>
        <p>Downloadable guides vary in depth and price. Zagat restaurant guides for Palm devices, for instance, are published by Landware for $29.95 for the first city and $14.95 for each additional city. Also for Palm-based devices are the Weissmann City Profiles guides, published by Aramis and priced at $59.95 for a package of major cities in either the United States or Europe. Information about individual cities can also be downloaded for $12.95 each.</p>
        <p>But more in tune with modern trekkers are the Web-based upstarts that are challenging the old hands with innovative services. The goods and services they offer are free to subscribers; advertising is the source of their revenue.</p>
        <p>A leader in the handheld information-on-the-go trade is AvantGo, which runs on both Palm and Windows CE and Pocket PC devices. Gaining access to the software and services requires registering with the site, then downloading the information to a P.D.A. AvantGo organizes the available Web sites, called channels, by categories. For travelers, the City/Regional and Travel categories are most useful.</p>
        <p>Choices in these categories are many and far-reaching, including a version of the popular CitySearch.com service, which gives a rundown of what is going on in most United States (and some foreign) cities. The information includes live shows and movies, restaurants, nightclubs and other recreation and events. Other AvantGo travel channels include a mapping program for getting from Point A to Point B, and RestaurantRow.com, which organizes restaurants based on ZIP code and will even phone or mail in a reservation on your behalf through the channel's concierge service.</p>
        <p>After the user picks channels of interest, the AvantGo site plucks the desired bits of information from the partners (including The New York Times) that are the sources of material. That data is transferred to the handheld the next time the user runs Palm's HotSync program or Microsoft's ActiveSync on Pocket PC's. ActiveSync can also be set to update the handheld constantly as long as it is in its cradle, connected to the computer.</p>
        <p>Both Pocket PC and Palm users may also choose to turn any Web page into a custom channel. The Pocket PC approach is a one-step process, requiring only a click of the Create Mobile Favorite menu in Internet Explorer to send the page to the device the next time it is synchronized. Palm users use AvantGo to accomplish the same thing, with an extra step thrown in: they choose how often to update each page -- at every sync, only once or once a week. AvantGo for the Pocket PC works the same way.</p>
        <p>A compelling new city guide for Palm devices is Vindigo, which, unlike AvantGo's wide-reaching selection of channels, focuses on eating, shopping and playing. The service looks only at New York, although the company says it expects to offer information for other cities by summer. The Vindigo program gets its information from New York Today, which is owned by The New York Times Company.</p>
        <p>Tap in a location, and Vindigo arranges your options accordingly, relative to the closest cross-streets. Listings can also be browsed by neighborhood, and many are accompanied by a brief review. The program automatically generates walking directions to get you where you want to go by  the most direct route. The company said it was exploring other platforms, which means Pocket PC.</p>
        <p>For those who want to be connected anywhere, anytime, Palm sells the Palm VII, a wireless device that gives the user access to the Palm.Net service, which offers live Web clippings of specific, tailored information (as opposed to the actual Web sites themselves). The Palm.Net site's Web clipping applications for travelers include flight schedules and tracking for major airlines, traffic coverage and directions, Fodor's and Frommer's guidebooks, a gas station finder and weather reports.</p>
        <p>Palm.Net's Web-clipping service has been criticized for being too expensive. The basic service is $9.99 a month for 50 kilobytes of data (about 150 Palm VII screens), an extended plan is $24.99 a month for 150 kilobytes, and a volume plan is $39.99 for 300 kilobytes. Each plan charges 20 cents a kilobyte if the data limits are exceeded.</p>
        <p>Palm.Net and other vendors are coming up with improvements that make the Palm VII more useful. For example, PalmNet's new unlimited plan, for $44.99 a month, lets users clip to their hearts' content. And while Palm.Net's e-mail lets subscribers check only their Palm.Net e-mail accounts, ThinAir software by ThinAirApps allows the  Palm VII to check e-mail accounts at most other places.</p>
        <p>For those who want a less limiting live connection, Omnisky offers a $299 wireless modem for Palm V handhelds and unlimited access for $39.95 a month in most metropolitan areas in the United States. A tiny Web browser and e-mail program offer those services on the fly, as well as the option of using the wireless HotSync feature to update AvantGo channels whenever you want.  Palm and Pocket PC handheld users can also do that with portable standard modems and ordinary phone connections to their I.S.P.'s. Omnisky says it is working on devices for other handhelds, which means additional Palm devices as well as those running Pocket PC.</p>
        <p>Where the Pocket PC's have the Palms beat is in their map offerings. Except for the Palm IIIc, all the Palm-based devices have monochrome screens that glow green when you turn on the backlight. The latest Pocket PC's have color displays that come close to the quality of expensive desktop and notebook screens, and the version of Pocket Streets that Microsoft bundles with every Pocket PC device is handy for those who want to zoom in to check exact locations in  many major cities.</p>
        <p>For travelers who want to take a book or two with them on their handheld, the Microsoft Reader program for Pocket PC is easier on the eye than trying to read a large amount of text on a Palm or Visor. The company promises that online e-book vendors will start offering titles in Reader format soon. For now, Palm users have the better pick of the shelves, with mainstream nonfiction and fiction e-books from Peanut Press, Editio-books.com and Electron Press. For less serious diversions, the Palm's green screen cannot match the beauty of the Pocket PC's version of Pac-Man -- an exact replica of the arcade classic.</p>
        <p>Organizing and securing one's personal travel information is easily done with either platform's built-in programs. The Handspring Visor's Datebook + beats Palm's products with a handy month-at-a-glance option. Or users can buy more robust agenda programs tweaked for travelers, like Landware's Gulliver or Datebk4 from Pimlico Software.</p>
        <p>For Pocket PC users, Microsoft has tied in an Expedia.com channel that transfers Web-based travel itineraries to the handheld device and, for watching expenses, a miniature version of Microsoft Money. Palm users can synchronize the built-in Expense program's entries with Microsoft Excel on a desktop computer.</p>
        <p>Both platforms offer capable address book and notes programs for keeping track of airline and travel agent phone numbers, passport and personal information and all those user names and passwords for all the sites the handhelds are linked to. Each also offers security options for marking certain records private.</p>
        <p>For more dire matters of security, ReturnMe.com offers ''If Found'' stickers and a code number to register with its site. The first sticker is free, but the service charges $9.95 for a set of 12 all-weather identification tags for things like cell phones, briefcases, pagers, wallets or purses. Each tag directs anyone who finds one of these possessions to get in touch with ReturnMe.com, which puts the finder's name into a sweepstakes; the owner of the lost item pays to have the item returned. ReturnMe.com also encourages the owner to give the finder a reward -- which is advisable for people who don't want to be left empty-handed.</p>
