        <p>Sanford Sylvan, baritone</p>
        <p>Weill Recital Hall</p>
        <p>Sanford Sylvan is one of the most engaging of singers, partly because his voice is so light and natural. Projecting an unusual amount of head tone, even -- at appropriate expressive moments -- of falsetto, he is a baritone moving a little way toward being a countertenor. Hence the youthfulness of his vocal personality, and the innocence, trapped or maintained or remembered within a more mature soul.</p>
        <p>One can understand why Jorge Martin's hourlong song cycle ''Glass Hammer'' might have appealed to him, for it presents an adult character recalling a fraught boyhood. Andrew Hudgins's poems are children's scenes as Schumann never knew: immediate and often fierce notations of suffering parental anger and hopelessness, of self-discovery as an illumination of darkness, of sex as worrying, unfathomable and urgent.</p>

        <p>Sanford Sylvan, baritone</p>

        <p>Sanford Sylvan is one of the most engaging of singers, partly because his voice is so light and natural. Projecting an unusual amount of head tone, even -- at appropriate expressive moments -- of falsetto, he is a baritone moving a little way toward being a countertenor. Hence the youthfulness of his vocal personality, and the innocence, trapped or maintained or remembered within a more mature soul.</p>
        <p>One can understand why Jorge Martin's hourlong song cycle ''Glass Hammer'' might have appealed to him, for it presents an adult character recalling a fraught boyhood. Andrew Hudgins's poems are children's scenes as Schumann never knew: immediate and often fierce notations of suffering parental anger and hopelessness, of self-discovery as an illumination of darkness, of sex as worrying, unfathomable and urgent.</p>
        <p>On Friday night Mr. Sylvan's investment of himself in these scenes was remarkable. But the music had rather little to do with it. Mr. Martin keeps to a narrow and unadventurous stylistic world, depriving himself of the means to add much to the high emotional temperatures and the atmosphere of disquiet and desperation in the text.</p>
        <p>The use of a Bach-invention style to underscore ''Begotten,'' a depressing tale of genetics, would have worked better if the counterpoint had been more thrilling. And the ambiguity of the last line here -- where the boy, looking at his relations, thinks, ''So this, dear God, is what I am'' -- was restrained by the music, though Mr. Sylvan did his best to prize it free again.</p>
        <p>In another number, ''Fireflies After Twilight,'' the insect image in the piano could not live up to the example of Ravel's cricket in ''Histoires Naturelles,'' which Mr. Sylvan had included in the first half of his program.</p>
        <p>The Ravel offered the singer most: beautiful and expressive lines, which he freshly sang, and a knowing tone he made delightfully comic. David Breitman, at the piano, was also excellent here: precise, imaginative, sensitive to his partner and highly effective on his own account.</p>
