        <p>A Partnership Goes to Court</p>
        <p>Once they were the best of business pals. Now IAN SCHRAGER is suing RANDE GERBER, the former male model who runs the hipper-than-hip bars in Mr. Schrager's hipper-than-hip hotels.</p>
        <p>In the lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Mr. Schrager accused Mr. Gerber of violating their longstanding agreement by arranging deals with two competing hotel owners. Mr. Schrager accused Mr. Gerber of making two executives of Starwood Hotels -- which runs the W Hotel, two blocks from Mr. Schrager's Morgans Hotel at 237 Madison Avenue -- principals in the Gerber holding company that runs the bar at Morgans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gerber also operates two bars in Mr. Schrager's Paramount Hotel, on West 46th Street near Eighth Avenue. The lawsuit also accuses Mr. Gerber, who runs Skybar at Mr. Schrager's Mondrian Hotel in Los Angeles, of opening another bar in a hotel next door.</p>
        <p>''He basically is not functioning as a faithful partner,'' Mr. Schrager's lawyer, STANLEY S. ARKIN, said of Mr. Gerber. ''He's a guy who was trained absolutely by Ian, who was taken from being basically a real estate broker cum male model. Rande was made by Ian, and now he turns on him.'' (Along the way, Mr. Gerber also married the model CINDY CRAWFORD.)</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Gerber, ANDREW WINTNER, said that Mr. Gerber had not seen the lawsuit but that the accusations had ''absolutely no merit.'' The chief executive of Starwood, BARRY S. STERNLICHT, called the suit ''totally preposterous'' but said that Starwood owned 49 percent of Mr. Gerber's business.</p>
        <p>''I saw Ian a week ago,'' Mr. Sternlicht said. ''He was giving me a hug. I just ran into him at the opening of his hotel in the U.K., which I think is a lovely hotel, by the way. I'm just astonished that he thinks W is such a threat to him that he would launch such a frivolous lawsuit.''</p>
        <p>Recollections Of an Encounter</p>
        <p>When BISHOP EDWARD M. EGAN agreed to celebrate a Mass for the 25th anniversary of the ordination of two priests in his diocese in Bridgeport, Conn., he envisioned an intimate gathering at St. Augustine's Cathedral there.</p>
        <p>Instead, the anniversaries of FATHER ROBERT G. POHLEY and FATHER DENNIS BLUDNICKI yesterday became the backdrop for what might be Bishop Egan's final sermon there, if he is named archbishop of New York, succeeding Cardinal John O'Connor, who died last week.</p>
        <p>In keeping with protocol, Bishop Egan could not publicly acknowledge the possibility of his appointment before Cardinal O'Connor's successor is named by the Vatican.</p>
        <p>But there was no mistaking his tacit delight during the hourlong service yesterday.</p>
        <p>With reporters and photographers outnumbering the 15 or so family members on hand to honor the two priests, Bishop Egan used his sermon to speak of his encounters with Pope John Paul II.</p>
        <p>He said he had first seen the pope on Holy Thursday in 1970, when the Vatican sent him on a mission to the Orthodox churches, and he found himself concelebrating Mass with the archbishop of Cracow, Karol Wojtyla.</p>
        <p>''I must confess I did not even know his name,'' the bishop said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Bishop Egan, a native of Chicago, served in Rome for many years, where he developed a relationship with the pope while explaining details of canon law to him.</p>
        <p>Several church officials credit the relationship between the two men for the bishop's possible rise to a post that John Paul II once described as ''archbishop of the most powerful country in the world.''</p>
        <p>Bishop Egan does not have a reputation for cultivating the press in his diocese, but he was playful yesterday. More than an hour after the Mass ended, he strode to his waiting car outside St. Augustine's, where he encountered the inevitable cluster of photographers and reporters.</p>
        <p>He paused just long enough for the shutters to click, and then marched off. ''Bishop, what's on your agenda for tomorrow?'' someone asked.</p>
        <p>''You be real good now,'' was all he said.</p>
