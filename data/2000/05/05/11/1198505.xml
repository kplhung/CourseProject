        <p>MORE than 100 Chinese tree peonies are blooming this month in the ''Chinese Peony Show,'' which runs through June 4 at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Tree peonies, revered in China for more than 1,500 years, have been celebrated in art and poetry. And their roots have long been used in herbal remedies.</p>
        <p>But most of all, they are enchanting to look at, with eight-inch flowers, whose colors may vary from deep red and magenta to silky white, and they are often intensely fragrant.</p>

        <p>MORE than 100 Chinese tree peonies are blooming this month in the ''Chinese Peony Show,'' which runs through June 4 at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Tree peonies, revered in China for more than 1,500 years, have been celebrated in art and poetry. And their roots have long been used in herbal remedies.</p>
        <p>But most of all, they are enchanting to look at, with eight-inch flowers, whose colors may vary from deep red and magenta to silky white, and they are often intensely fragrant.</p>
        <p>These peonies, grown by David and Kasha Furman of Cricket Hill Garden in Thomaston, Conn., are the basis of a collection intended to bloom every year at the garden. With names like Black Dragon Holds a Splendid Flower, Better Than Jade With Triple Magic and Tipsy Imperial Concubine, these ancient plants may galvanize jaded gardeners into yet another obsession.</p>
        <p>The peonies, which are blooming in the Enid Haupt Conservatory, are accompanied by other classic Chinese favorites, like bleeding heart, hydrangea, heavenly bamboo, fishpole bamboo and grasslike lilies.</p>
        <p>On Saturday and Sunday afternoon, there will be entertainment for visitors, consisting of Chinese folk tales, a lion dance (the Chinatown Community Young Lions dance a giant dragon ''to life'') and traditional Chinese music. For information, (718) 817-8700.</p>
