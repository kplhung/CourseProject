        <p>Unilever, the food-to-detergents consumer goods giant that is trying to buy Bestfoods for $18.3 billion, said today that its first-quarter operating profit rose 12 percent in what the company depicted as a first victory in an ambitious program to cut costs.</p>
        <p>The stock price of Unilever, a British-Dutch concern based in London and Rotterdam, fell sharply when the bid was announced on May 3. It strengthened today on the earnings news, with the British shares closing up 5.3 percent at $:4.0375, or $6.12, and the Dutch shares up 7.2 percent at 52.35 euros, or $48.09.</p>
        <p>Bestfoods of Englewood Cliffs, N.J., has rejected the Unilever bid and is said by analysts to be seeking a higher offer than Unilever's $66 a share.</p>
        <p>The improvement in Unilever's stock price does not directly affect the all-cash bid for Bestfoods, the parent company of supermarket brands that include Knorr soups, Hellman's mayonnaise and Dove soap. But Unilever's earnings performance offered what analysts said was evidence that a $5 billion, five-year program announced in February is showing results.</p>
        <p>The cost-cutting measures include a plan to winnow Unilever's 1,600 brands to 400, close 100 factories and reduce the global work force of 250,000 by 10 percent. Today's figures, said David Lang, an analyst at Investec Henderson Crosthwaite, ''reflect the success they are having in focusing on major brands.''</p>
        <p>The increase in profit, which surpassed analysts' expectations, came without a strong gain in sales, indicating the effects of cost-cutting. The company said profit from operations rose to 716 million euros, or $659 million, compared with 640 million euros in the period a year earlier. The figures were based on exchange rates in the first quarter, lifted in part by the euro's weakness against the dollar. Dollar sales in the United States account for about one-fifth of Unilever's revenue.</p>
        <p>Part of Unilever's rationale in bidding for Bestfoods is to strengthen its position in both the United States and in emerging markets.</p>
        <p>Even without Bestfoods, Unilever has been pursuing an aggressive strategy of acquisitions, buying Ben &amp; Jerry's for $326 million and Slim-Fast for $2.6 billion last month as part of what it says is an effort to concentrate on high-growth, top brands.</p>
        <p>''Our strategy of focusing resources on leading brands is on track,'' the company's co-chairmen, Antony Burgmans and Niall Fitzgerald, said in a statement. ''We are managing the migration to a faster-growth portfolio without endangering our profitability.''</p>
        <p>They made no direct reference to the Bestfoods bid, which, a company spokesman said, ''seems to be at a bit of an impasse.'' But in a presentation to analysts, Unilever said it thought it had offered a fair price, and the spokesman said Unilever believed there was a ''substantial role'' for Bestfoods managers in a combined enterprise.</p>
        <p>In describing the benefits of the proposed deal, the company said the combination was like ''marrying the girl next door.''</p>
        <p>Today's figures showed Unilever's cost-cutting to be producing more notable financial results than similar measures at the rival Procter &amp; Gamble, which last month reported its first drop in quarterly earnings in nine years.</p>
