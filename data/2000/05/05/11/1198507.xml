        <p>IN his 15 years on the job, Jack has been trapped in coal mines and forced to lift and carry objects that could break his back, and once while pregnant -- yes, pregnant -- was stuffed into a car to see if he could fit behind the wheel and reach the pedals.</p>
        <p>Jack never complains, however, because Jack is a piece of software, a virtual reality representation of a person who can take on various forms -- like a bulky man or a pregnant woman -- then operate within various environments and sometimes in concert with other virtual humans.</p>
        <p>Developed at the University of Pennsylvania beginning in 1984, Jack has spent more than a decade in the service of industry and government, showing car manufacturers whether their designs can accommodate a person of a certain size, or construction companies whether a particular task might leave employees injured and unproductive. He has even helped the United States military train soldiers.</p>
        <p>Instead of flesh and blood, Jack is made of computer code and lives in a virtual world inside a video monitor. Jack -- named for the child's toy, which resembles the axes of a three-dimensional computer model -- can walk, avoid obstacles, reach and lift. But if he cannot perform a certain task -- if an object is too heavy or out of reach -- an image of the character will signal a problem, sometimes by turning a body part a different color on a computer screen. Jack rolls with the punches so that we don't have to.</p>
        <p>With a virtual reality helmet or a video screen, users of the software can also see through Jack's eyes. In one instance, Jack caused the John Deere company to send a prototype back to the drawing board after the company found that the design obstructed Jack's view of the vehicle's blades.</p>
        <p>''They went back and redesigned those parts of the tractor long before it went into production and saved them an uncountable number of dollars,'' said Prof. Norman Badler, the developer of Jack and the director of the Center for Human Modeling and Simulation at Penn. ''Once there's a production line, you don't want to change the design.''</p>
        <p>Although many companies have developed human-looking digital characters with limited capabilities, like the wide-eyed virtual newscaster Ananova, several companies and universities have developed ''intelligent'' virtual human beings that are programmed to move and even respond like people.</p>
        <p>Virtual humans like Jack can be placed on a virtual battlefield, in a simulated car interior or in any other environment that can be created on a computer. The virtual human is then programmed to perform a specific act -- like Jack reaching for the car's cigarette lighter, which causes him to bump his head on the dashboard -- and the results are displayed on Jack's image on a computer screen and numerically on a printout. Designers can add realism to the environment by importing graphics and special effects.</p>
        <p>Developers of this type of software are trying to imitate the complexity of real people as closely as possible. Recently, more sophisticated virtual humans have been programmed with psychological traits to study how people might react in an emergency, like a chemical fire or a riot.</p>
        <p>In one situation, a crowd of protestors, waving fists and holding banners, walks down a city street. Each protestor is programmed with a mood and a personality, which determine reactions to different events, like a knife being pulled or police firing a shot. Watching these reactions over the entire crowd would show authorities how best to maintain safety in various situations.</p>
        <p>''The ultimate objective in creating realistic and believable virtual actors is to build intelligent autonomous virtual humans with adaptation, perception and memory,'' said Prof. Daniel Thalmann, director of the Computer Graphics Lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in Lausanne, Switzerland. ''These actors should be able to act freely and emotionally. Ideally, they should be conscious and unpredictable.''</p>
        <p>The earliest virtual humans were developed in the 1960's. One of their earliest applications was in testing an aircraft landing procedure. In 1981 the United States government financed a project at the University of Pennsylvania to develop a virtual human model for engineering design studies. The software, a precursor to Jack, demonstrated to NASA that the toilet system on the space shuttle needed to be redesigned to accommodate larger astronauts.</p>
        <p>By the 1990's, Jack had become more realistic. ''You don't make the brain smarter, you make the rest of the body smarter, getting it to walk properly, use its arms and legs to reach properly at steering wheels, pedals and knobs, lifting things properly,'' Dr. Badler said. ''Within the last 10 years the main emphasis of what we've done has been on telling the model what to do rather than showing it in excruciating detail what to do.''</p>
        <p>A more advanced Jack, for example, could be instructed through a voice interface to take cover behind a vehicle, rather than have to be programmed with the specific motions needed for that task. The University of Pennsylvania's human modeling center, which still uses the Jack software, is working on expanding Jack's ability to respond to natural language commands.</p>
        <p>In 1996, Jack was sold to Transom Technologies, which was later acquired by Engineering Animation, a company that specializes in visual applications for engineering and manufacturing. Today the company charges about $25,000 for the Jack software, according to Ulrich Raschke, Engineering Animation's program manager for virtual simulation. Developing a cast of characters, placing them in an environment and assigning them tasks requires hours or days, depending on complexity, Dr. Raschke said. The software, however, does not require expensive computers and can run on a high-end PC.</p>
        <p>Other companies have developed software similar to Jack. Boston Dynamics specializes in virtual humans software for military and law enforcement use. The software can train soldiers for ground attacks, urban combat, biological warfare and medical emergencies. In one application, the motions of a human soldier carrying a mock weapon and running on a treadmill can be transferred to a virtual counterpart running along a path, ready to attack.</p>
        <p>Training software that relies on virtual reality provides several advantages over other training methods, including one called branched video. A video with real actors plays on a screen in front of a trainee who wields a gunlike device that is connected to the video system. The actors in the video scene respond to the actions of the trainee.</p>
        <p>Virtual systems provide real-time feedback to the participant and are cheaper than branched video. And unlike branched video, in which the number of scenes is limited, a virtual system can relay specific responses to each of a participant's actions and thereby introduce more variables into the scenario.</p>
        <p>In a checkpoint monitoring system being developed for the Navy, trainees will control Jack with voice commands during computer-guided emergencies, like a terrorist threat. The simulation can be run over and over, with different results each time. ''If you want to train a soldier at a checkpoint, you would rather they encounter the bad situation in simulation rather than in real life,'' Dr. Badler said.</p>
        <p>Although single virtual actors can help train individuals, some organizations are using virtual humans in groups to try to model crowd psychology. The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Matra Systemes &amp;  Information of France and Britain's Scotland Yard are working together on a system to simulate emergencies like a chemical plant explosion or a riot. Individuals in the crowd are programmed with personalities and moods, and react in different way to the emergency. The system can help security agencies understand how crowds react and how best to use police officers and other emergency workers to keep order.</p>
        <p>Ideally, the members of these virtual crowds would interact the way humans do. But crude graphics and the limits of artificial intelligence have kept interactions fairly basic. ''Human expressions are very, very complicated,'' said Barbara O. Rothbaum, an associate professor of psychiatry at the Emory University School of Medicine, who is working on a project to use virtual reality simulations to treat phobias in patients. ''We might make a distinction between a genuine smile, a sinister smile and a not-so-genuine smile. You're not going to make those distinctions as a virtual human.''</p>
        <p>Still, fairly complicated applications like crowd control are useful even with the current state of the technology. ''Think about cartoons,'' Dr. Rothbaum said, ''and how they relay a lot of information in really fairly simple lines: the direction of the eyebrows, the direction of the shoulders.''</p>
        <p>While some systems can cost thousands of dollars, spending $50 at the video game store can give regular computer users a chance to interact with their virtual counterparts. The Sims, a popular game from Electronic Arts, has impressed the researchers with its realistic human characters who interact with family and friends. Dr. Badler is purchasing a copy for his lab, to try to link it with his advanced systems.</p>
        <p>That home computer users can interact with believable virtual humans on their PC's is a testament to how advances in computing power might propel virtual humans into many more aspects of production, training and entertainment. The next logical step might be to find people modeling a whole range of actions -- traveling, business, sleeping -- with virtual humans.</p>
        <p>''You can imagine going onto the Web with an avatar that looks very much like yourself and going into chat rooms and basically presenting yourself virtually on the Web and controlling yourself,'' said Dr. Raschke of Engineering Animation. ''You can really expand this out to the whole range of what humans are involved with. Let your imagination go.''</p>
