        <p>THREE European companies that offer designer bathroom fixtures and decorative hardware are opening their first American showrooms in the New York area this month. Even though European designs have been available here, it used to take some hunting and foraging in disparate places to piece together an entire bathroom.  For those not intending to completely renovate, there are other new products this spring, including a mirror in a spiffy brushed-aluminum frame and an ingenious hookless shower curtain that will quickly enliven a tired-looking, winter-worn bathroom.</p>
        <p>1. At its first American showroom, Valli &amp; Valli, an Italian manufacturer of bathroom accessories and decorative hardware, is offering a medicine cabinet and mirror with a gooseneck light ($670). Valli &amp; Valli is at 150 East 58th Street.</p>
