        <p>After a brief meeting today, most of the Knicks worked on their shooting. But Marcus Camby passed up the rack of basketballs and instead cradled an electronic stimulation machine in his right arm as he sat against a wall.</p>
        <p>His right eye was swollen nearly shut with an adhesive bandage over a cut on his eyelid. That injury was the result of his taking an elbow from the Heat's Otis Thorpe during the Knicks' 82-76 victory Tuesday night in Miami.</p>

        <p>After a brief meeting today, most of the Knicks worked on their shooting. But Marcus Camby passed up the rack of basketballs and instead cradled an electronic stimulation machine in his right arm as he sat against a wall.</p>
        <p>His right eye was swollen nearly shut with an adhesive bandage over a cut on his eyelid. That injury was the result of his taking an elbow from the Heat's Otis Thorpe during the Knicks' 82-76 victory Tuesday night in Miami.</p>
        <p>Camby's right elbow was attached to a tangle of wires in an effort to keep the swelling down on a bruise he sustained after he crashed to the floor at American Airlines Arena in the first half.</p>
        <p>The slender reserve was also nursing of a sore wrist as a result of that tumble, but he didn't mention the sore knees that had put him on the injured list twice this season.</p>
        <p>''I've got a full range of motion,'' Camby said of the elbow. ''I've been treating it all morning and all last night when we got in late. I'll continue to treat it all day today and tomorrow. I don't think it will affect me.''</p>
        <p>Despite his injuries, Camby maintained his sense of humor. He laughed about the notion that he epitomized the physical Knicks-Heat Eastern Conference semifinal series.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, the games are physical,'' Camby said. ''But I don't think my being hit in the eye was deliberate. Everybody was going for the ball and I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was just the nature of the game being physical under the basket and stuff. That's how the series is going to be played: both teams getting after each other, being aggressive.''</p>
        <p>When he was acquired by the Knicks two years ago from the Toronto Raptors, Camby had a reputation as a soft player. But Tuesday night he iced his injured elbow at halftime and returned to action as the Knicks tied the four-of-seven-game series at a game apiece.</p>
        <p>Camby said he would be ready for Game 3 on Friday night.</p>
        <p>''They want me to get X-rays and an M.R.I. today, but I don't think it was necessary,'' said Camby, who won that argument and did not have to undergo the procedures.</p>
        <p>''I'll be fine. It was hard to sleep on it, plus my eye and my wrist, but I'll be all right. I think I'll be fine and ready to go on Friday. I could have practiced today.''</p>
        <p>His teammate Chris Childs said: ''The guy comes in practice and works hard and plays hurt. He's not afraid of challenges. He goes in and does all the little things to help the team win.</p>
        <p>''He's a guy I'm proud of because of the way he performed and sucked it up. He's always yelling: 'I'm tough. I'm tough.' He proved it last night.''</p>
        <p>Ewing Does Homework</p>
        <p>Patrick Ewing opted to work longer and harder than any other Knick player today, despite the back spasms that have plagued him for the last five days.</p>
        <p>Ewing spent nearly an hour, first banging with Andrew Lang in an intense game of one on one, and then working with the assistant coach Brendan Malone to correct flaws that have limited him to 35.7 percent shooting in the first two games of the Eastern Conference semifinals.</p>
        <p>''I'm trying to get back in the groove,'' Ewing said when he finally came off the floor.</p>
        <p>The 37-year-old center was so overheated that he waited until he got to the locker room to envelop himself in his usual ice-pack wrap.</p>
        <p>''I think the fact I was hampered I kind of lost my footwork,'' he said. ''I just worked on it a little bit.''</p>
        <p>''Hampered'' was as far as Ewing would go toward acknowledging that his back was even a minor problem. After spending last season limping on a strained Achilles' tendon until it finally tore in the Eastern Conference finals, he did not consider this injury worth discussing.</p>
        <p>''I'm not worrying about my back,'' he said. ''I'm able to play. It feels fine.''</p>
        <p>His former college coach, John Thompson, said in the TNT telecast on Tuesday night that Ewing's back was hurting more than he was letting on.</p>
        <p>Ewing, however, would not respond to that notion.</p>
        <p>''I'm able to play,'' the Knick said.</p>
        <p>Childs Eats His Words</p>
        <p>Chris Childs spoke up on Monday, commenting that the Knicks would have to play a more physical brand of defense.</p>
        <p>The words drew an unfavorable response from Rod Thorn, the National Basketball Association's senior vice president for basketball operations. And it seemed to show on the floor in Game 2, when Childs fouled out in 11 minutes of action.</p>
        <p>''Right things to say, wrong person,'' Childs said. ''I don't know if it was because of that. I'm done talking about that.''</p>
        <p>When he fouled out with 6 minutes 59 seconds remaining in Tuesday's game, Childs yelled at Miami's Tim Hardaway. Childs felt that Hardaway had thrown an intentional elbow at his face. He then left the bench and went to the locker room to cool off.</p>
        <p>''I mean, the fouls were my fault,'' Childs said. ''I didn't adjust to the way the game was being called. But I only know one way to play, and that's as hard as possible. That's what my teammates and coaches expect of me. But I've been around long enough. I should have adjusted and kind of backed off the pressure a little bit. I don't think it called for me to be called for a foul the time I got hit in the face with an elbow. But I didn't adjust, so I'm to blame not the refs.''</p>
        <p>Childs added: ''I said some things to Tim afterward. He didn't say anything. I just didn't think it was necessary to do that. It's not the first time it ever happened. What's done is done. I'm not going to concern myself about that too much.''</p>
