        <p>President Clinton, in the face of strong opposition from the United States pharmaceutical industry, issued an executive order today to make AIDS drugs available far more cheaply throughout sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
        <p>The order declares that the United States government will not seek to interfere with countries in that region that may violate American patent law in order to provide AIDS drugs at lower prices. The language of the executive order is nearly identical to an amendment that was deleted at the behest of the drug industry from an African trade bill that Congress is considering this week.</p>
        <p>The order issued by President Clinton essentially extended to most of Africa a special arrangement provided last year to South Africa.</p>
        <p>''This order is intended to help stop the spread of this devastating disease by making H.I.V./AIDS-related drugs and medical technologies more accessible and affordable in sub-Saharan African countries,'' Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, said today. She said she believed it struck a balance between fighting the disease and maintaining integrity of patents.</p>
        <p>In practice, officials said, that means that Washington will not object if African countries move to greatly reduce the price of AIDS drugs, either by licensing local companies to produce generic versions or importing the drugs from third countries where they are available at lower cost.</p>
        <p>Both practices may be challenged under United States patent laws. But Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who had co-sponsored the amendment that was deleted from the Africa trade bill, said the two practices were ''fully consistent with World Trade Organization rules, which allow countries flexibility in addressing public health concerns.'' Senator Feinstein said that the deletion of the amendment she sponsored with Senator Russell D. Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, threatened to impede the fight against AIDS in Africa.</p>
        <p>She said that some 34 million people in sub-Saharan Africa have been infected with the disease since its onset and nearly 12 million have died. ''The fatalities in sub-Saharan Africa represent 83 percent of the world's total H.I.V./AIDS-related deaths,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Alan F. Holmer, the president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the principal trade group for the drug industry, said the executive order set a troubling precedent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holmer said that he agreed there was a great need to fight the disease vigorously and he welcomed the sections of the executive order that call for increased education and improvement of public health services. ''However, the approach taken by the President's executive order sets an undesirable and inappropriate precedent by adopting a discriminatory approach to intellectual property laws and focusing exclusively on pharmaceuticals,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Industry officials said that they believed it was wrong to carve out an exception for one disease and one region. ''If Africa today, why not Asia tomorrow or even the United States,'' one official said.</p>
        <p>The compromise version of the trade bill was approved by the House last week and is expected to win final passage in the Senate, possibly Thursday. It gives African and Caribbean countries broad new trading privileges by expanding duty-free access to American markets.</p>
