        <p>President Vladimir V. Putin named as prime minister today a chief foreign-debt negotiator and a liberal economics expert. The long predicted move, some experts said, bodes well for efforts to tame Russia's feral style of capitalism.</p>
        <p>That view was bolstered by a separate report today that Mr. Putin might abolish the Fuel and Energy Ministry as he reorganizes the cabinet. The immensely powerful agency has often been attacked as a seat of corruption and a brake on capitalist reforms.</p>
        <p>Since January, when Mr. Putin became acting president, the new prime minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, has held the post of first deputy prime minister, which was the government's No. 2 position. He frequently stood in for Mr. Putin as the acting president campaigned for the full four-year term that he won in elections in March.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kasyanov, 42, is best known as the pragmatic and savvy  negotiator who persuaded private Western creditors in February to agree to a reduction of nearly $32 billion in Russian debt.</p>
        <p>The creditors, known as the London Club, agreed after months of talks to accept bonds worth as little as 62.5 cents for every dollar owed. That now seems an exceptionally good deal for Russia, which was -- and is -- reaping an unexpectedly large income from a rebounding economy and high-price oil exports.</p>
        <p>Klaus Regling, who negotiated with Mr. Kasyanov as the German Finance Ministry's chief international officer in the 1990's, called him an extremely tough bargainer who won the respect not just of the Germans, but also of the Americans in the Treasury Department, as well.</p>
        <p>''When he signed off on something, you knew it was really a done deal,'' Mr. Regling, now a finance expert in London, said. ''There are always all these advisers around. But he didn't need that. You could really do it with just two persons in the room.''</p>
        <p>The nomination of Mr. Kasyanov, a tall, beefy man with a gravelly voice and a crushing handshake, goes to the lower house of Parliament, the Duma, which plans a vote next Wednesday. The speaker, Gennadi Seleznyov, a Communist, predicted that he would be confirmed easily, even though the Communists have serious questions about the Kremlin's economic bent.</p>
        <p>''Most Duma members are not allergic to Kasyanov,'' Mr. Seleznyov said.</p>
        <p>The consensus among experts was that Mr. Kasyanov would continue to have a strong hand in fiscal policy, pushing to streamline tax and regulatory codes.</p>
        <p>The chairman of the Budget Committee in Parliament, Aleksandr Zhukov, said in a radio interview the government was preparing ''drastic changes to some of the main taxes,'' including the income and excise taxes and the payroll tax for welfare funds, which could change the landscape of the budget and economy.</p>
        <p>Separately, the semiofficial Interfax news service quoted a government source as having said Mr. Putin is considering eliminating several cabinet-level agencies, including the Economics and the Fuel and Energy Ministries. Their duties would be folded into the Finance Ministry and other departments.</p>
        <p>The Fuel and Energy Ministry has been marked by liberals as a test of Mr. Putin's willingness to confront entrenched interests.</p>
        <p>Although much of the oil industry is in private hands, natural gas remains more or less a government monopoly. And the ministry wields enormous influence -- much of it for the benefit of special interests, critics say -- through its control of pipelines and the pricing of oil products.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, the critics have demanded the ouster of Energy Minister Viktor I. Kalyuzhny, who they say has imposed new production quotas and tariffs that insiders can easily manipulate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kasyanov hedged when asked about a cabinet shake-up. ''It is necessary to make some adjustments in the structure of the federal organs of power,'' he said, adding that those changes ''will not be global ones.''</p>
        <p>Some express doubts -- similar to those expressed about Mr. Putin -- as to whether Mr. Kasyanov is willing to free the economy from the grip of the financial-industrial combines that dominate several industries and their government regulators.</p>
        <p>Some racier muckraking newspapers have called Mr. Kasyanov ''Misha 2 Percent,'' contending that as Finance Minister he gave well-connected bankers inside information about the terms for the resale of old Soviet-era debts. Mr. Kasyanov has flatly denied that.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Putin, Mr. Kasyanov is also pegged by Moscow's rumor mill as close to two tycoons, Boris A. Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich, who have amassed huge stakes in Russia's oil, metals and media industries.</p>
        <p>This year, the two have cornered 70 percent of the aluminum industry with the blessing of the government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Abramovich raised eyebrows by showing up at invitation-only events that surrounded Mr. Putin's inauguration on Sunday.</p>
        <p>One of the best-known liberals of President Boris N. Yeltsin's government, Boris Nemtsov, warned this spring that Mr. Kasyanov's elevation to prime minister would mean a continuation of the robber-baron capitalism that helped ruin the economy.  Mr. Kasyanov scoffs at that. ''I don't have any concrete ties to any particular financial-industrial group,'' he said last month. ''I maintain contacts with everybody. I meet with Berezovsky very rarely, perhaps once every six months.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Kasyanov is credited with supporting a one-third increase in oil-export taxes and a requirement that oil companies pay their taxes in cash rather than through barter, two measures opposed by the so-called oligarchs.</p>
        <p>He rose the hard way. A graduate of the Moscow Automobile and Road College, he worked at the old Soviet central planning committee before switching, with the government, to a free-market economic philosophy after the Soviet Union died in 1991.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kasyanov spent two years at the Economics Ministry before joining Mr. Yeltsin's Finance Ministry, where he held several posts before becoming finance minister.</p>
