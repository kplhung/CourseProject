        <p>With its political options in Sierra Leone all but exhausted, the United Nations reluctantly ordered peacekeeping troops there today to take up defensive positions and prepare to fight rebels advancing toward the capital, Freetown.</p>

        <p>With its political options in Sierra Leone all but exhausted, the United Nations reluctantly ordered peacekeeping troops there today to take up defensive positions and prepare to fight rebels advancing toward the capital, Freetown.</p>
        <p>''We'll do what we have to do to defend ourselves and the government,'' the United Nations spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said here today. ''We hope it won't come to a pitched battle, but we are preparing for one.''</p>
        <p>He said the peacekeepers, who number more than 8,000, had been consolidated around Freetown and were digging in at the entrances to the capital.</p>
        <p>The lightly armed soldiers, who came to Sierra Leone to help the United Nations carry out a peace agreement signed last July between the government and the Revolutionary United Front, are not configured or equipped for conventional combat. Now the peacekeepers have been told to assume a role they did not expect to take on, lacking tanks, artillery and helicopter gunships.</p>
        <p>United Nations officials said they still know little or nothing about the whereabouts and condition of about 500 peacekeeping troops who were taken hostage by the rebels early last week -- the incident that precipitated the current crisis.</p>
        <p>One detachment of 208 Zambian soldiers, who were captured together with their armored personnel carriers, was reported to have been taken to Koidu, a rebel stronghold in eastern Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>There was no word on the fate of another contingent of 200 Zambians who disappeared later. Attempts to deliver food and other supplies to the captured peacekeepers have largely been thwarted. The United Nations has not specified the nationalities of the other hostages.</p>
        <p>President Charles Taylor of Liberia, who is close to the Sierra Leone rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, has been asked to win the peacekeepers' freedom, but so far has won only the release of a Russian helicopter crew and two passengers. Mr. Sankoh himself has been missing since protests outside his home in Freetown erupted into gunfire on Monday.</p>
        <p>The United Nations does not know the size or location of the rebel forces, which are thought to control about half the countryside. The rebels are armed with assault rifles and side arms. When the peace accord was reached last year, there were some 45,000 combatants, on all sides.</p>
        <p>United Nations officials said that a handful of peacekeepers have been killed and others have been wounded. The dead include Nigerian troops caught in a cross-fire between government troops and rebels at Rogberi last weekend, when a government helicopter accidentally fired rockets at the Nigerians.</p>
        <p>The Revolutionary United Front, Mr. Sankoh's rebel organization, has set no conditions for freeing the captured peacekeepers. He has denied that his forces held any peacekeepers, and his disappearance has left the United Nations with no one to approach directly for their release.</p>
        <p>The 13 armored personnel carriers that the rebels took from the Zambians have been painted black and have been seen moving with the rebels, officials said.</p>
        <p>With Sierra Leone sliding back into war, Mr. Eckhard said the United Nations would no longer report the movements of its troops or clashes with the rebels, who are already engaged against government forces.</p>
        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan's strategy has been to shore up the United Nations military presence in Sierra Leone sufficiently to deter the rebels while he seeks a political solution salvaging the peace accord.</p>
        <p>At the United Nations headquarters, where the mood was somber today, officials met with diplomats from Jordan, India and Bangladesh to discuss how to speed up the arrival in Sierra Leone of three infantry battalions that these countries had pledged for next month.</p>
        <p>The United States, Russia, Canada and the Netherlands have offered to supply aircraft to ferry the new troops into Sierra Leone. But the United States is limiting the carrying capacity of its transport planes and proposes charging the United Nations as much as or more than commercial air carriers would charge, diplomats complained. The other countries are considering carrying the troops for nothing or at cost.</p>
        <p>The arrival of new troops would lift the United Nations mission's military strength in Sierra Leone close to the authorized ceiling of 11,700, from 8,936 reported today.</p>
        <p>But officials said that airlifts could not begin for at least 10 days and would not be completed before the end of May.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan has received no response to his appeal for a well-equipped rapid reaction force. The mission has been criticized for the ease with which the rebels were able to overwhelm and detain United Nations soldiers.</p>
        <p>''The best peacekeeper is a well-trained soldier,'' Mr. Annan said today. ''And we would have liked to see some of the governments with capacity -- with good armies and well-trained soldiers -- to participate. But they are not running forward to contribute to this force. So we have to take the forces we get.''</p>
        <p>The secretary general seemed to allude to the United States and European powers when he said he hoped that strong countries ''would go to the assistance of those who are in there doing their bidding for the Security Council and the U.N.''</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration has ruled out putting American troops on the ground in Sierra Leone. But today, Mr. Annan expressed thanks for a British force of more than 800 paratroopers, which has secured the airport at Lungi, outside Freetown, freeing up United Nations soldiers to help defend the capital.</p>
        <p>''The British presence has been helpful,'' Mr. Annan said. ''They have done something, even though the initial objective was to evacuate British and other nationals.''</p>
        <p>For all the setbacks, the United Nations refused to say that its faltering mission to Sierra Leone had failed. ''For as long as it's possible, we're going to hang in there and try to revive this peace process,'' Mr. Eckhard said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan had hoped that the meeting of nine regional African leaders Tuesday in the Nigerian capital Abuja might find a political way out of the crisis in Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>In a communique, the regional leaders condemned the Revolutionary United Front for taking the peacekeepers hostage and called for their immediate release. They also warned that the amnesty granted the rebel leader, Mr. Sankoh, and others last July could be revoked. The rebels became notorious during the civil war for mutilating civilians.</p>
        <p>The regional leaders promised to use ''all means at their disposal, including the military option,'' to prevent the rebels from taking over Sierra Leone. But they stopped short of offering immediate help, saying that their defense ministers and chiefs of staff would meet next Wednesday to consider reviving a Nigerian-led intervention force that defended Freetown against the rebels before the peace treaty was signed last year.</p>
        <p>Some United Nations officials were dubious about bringing in new Nigerian troops, a proposal espoused by the United States, because the veterans who fought the rebels had been sent home and demobilized, and their replacements would probably be new and untested recruits.</p>
        <p>The Security Council, which authorized the peacekeeping mission last Oct. 22, was briefed today on the situation by Hedi Annabi, the assistant secretary general for peacekeeping operations. But it decided to put off decisions about what to do next until it hears from Bernard Miyet, the under secretary for peacekeeping, who is heading back from a visit to Sierra Leone, according to a diplomat at the meeting.</p>
        <p>The United Nations Children's Fund expressed concern today that the fighting would lead to the recruitment of child soldiers. The rebels used about 5,000 children to fight in Sierra Leone's nine-year civil war. ''The very high level of instability could lead us back into the vicious cycle where children are used as tools of war,'' Joanna Van Gerpen, the head of the agency's office in Freetown, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>The children's agency said it had to postpone the third round of its polio immunization campaign in Sierra Leone because of the deterioration in security.</p>
