        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Bob Herbert, in his May 8 column, ''Room to Learn,'' writes about  how smaller class sizes are beneficial to a student's learning experience.</p>
        <p>As a graduate of the New York public school system, I recall my experience at Forest Hills High School 25 years ago.</p>
        <p>Teachers repeatedly reminded me that because class ran for 40 minutes and since there were often 38 students in the class, there just wasn't that much time for answering my questions.</p>
        <p>Compounding the problem for teachers who said they were pressed for time was the fact that I stuttered. Listening to a parent recount a teacher's apology for not having enough time to devote to a child is something as memorable as catching a baseball fouled off by Mickey Mantle.</p>
        <p>I hope that educators will stick with small class sizes so that future generations of students won't have to endure excuses from burdened teachers.</p>
