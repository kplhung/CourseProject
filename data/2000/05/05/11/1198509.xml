        <p>IT was just three little words that brought the TriBeCa Grand Hotel, which opens Sunday, into being.</p>
        <p>''Don't be stupid,'' said Bernard Goldberg, the chairman of the Hospitality Group, to his friend, Leonard Stern, the chairman of the Hartz Group, who wasn't sure he wanted to spend $16 million for the 10,000-square-foot triangle where the Avenue of the Americas meets White, Church and Walker Streets.</p>

        <p>IT was just three little words that brought the TriBeCa Grand Hotel, which opens Sunday, into being.</p>
        <p>''Don't be stupid,'' said Bernard Goldberg, the chairman of the Hospitality Group, to his friend, Leonard Stern, the chairman of the Hartz Group, who wasn't sure he wanted to spend $16 million for the 10,000-square-foot triangle where the Avenue of the Americas meets White, Church and Walker Streets.</p>
        <p>It was 1998. TriBeCa? ''I thought it was the backwater of Wall Street,'' Mr. Stern said. ''I didn't get turned on.'' Two years before, just after opening the SoHo Grand four blocks away, he had passed on the site, then priced at $8 million. But he listened to Mr. Goldberg, at the time the owner of six successful Manhattan hotels, including the Shoreham, who recalled saying: ''TriBeCa has no hotels. But you see a proliferation of residential housing, and where there's life, there has to be hotels. Where do you put parents who have installed their children in multimillion-dollar lofts?''</p>
        <p>So Mr. Stern bought the empty triangle, and with his son Emanuel, whom he calls Manny, built a 203-room hotel. The cost, including the land, was $62 million.</p>
        <p>''It's got one killer design feature,'' Mr. Stern said of the 10,000-square-foot atrium, which makes the TriBeCa Grand one of only three atrium hotels in New York (the others are the Marriott Marquis and Le Parker Meridien). Glass elevators in steel cages glide up and down the eight stories, zooming past the atrium's bar, lounge and restaurant, offering an Eloise kind of fun.</p>
        <p>It's a hotel designed to take the loneliness out of travel. ''I used to travel 200,000 miles a year,'' said Mr. Stern, 62, a pet food, real estate and media magnate. ''There would be the camaraderie of work all day, and then you go to your hotel room, and it's a lonely, lonely experience.'' When he stayed at an Embassy Suites atrium hotel in Memphis (one is opening next week in the Wall Street area), he found a cure.</p>
        <p>His TriBeCa hotel, with its airy wrought-iron railings, was also inspired by three earlier atriums: the 1890 Metropolitan building in Minneapolis; the 1892 Brown Palace Hotel in Denver, which may be the first atrium hotel in the United States; and the 1893 Bradbury building in Los Angeles, which featured elevators wrapped in iron cages.</p>
        <p>The Sterns asked John Prince, an in-house architect at Hartz Mountain Industries, to execute a facade that would not make a statement. The resulting proposal, a pinky-red brick building with a granite base and wrought-iron rosettes, was so unprepossessing that Community Board 1 quickly approved it, almost unanimously. ''It was small, it's respectful of the neighborhood, it's brick and granite and not something very cheap like concrete block and a lot of glass,'' said Madelyn Wils, a board member.</p>
        <p>Now that it's built, some neighbors disagree. Carole Ashley, a TriBeCa artist and writer, said: ''The colors, the rosettes, the decorative things. What does this have to do with TriBeCa? It's a quasi, totally phony historic look. I would have preferred a modern building.''</p>
        <p>If the exterior aims at anonymity, the interior nearly vibrates. The atrium was created by Larry Bogdanow of Bogdanow Partners, which designed the Union Pacific restaurant in Manhattan. The guest rooms were designed by Calvin Tsao, whose firm, Tsao &amp; McKown, designed Metrazur in Grand Central Terminal. Anticipating an influx of dot-com, movie, media and advertising executives, the hotel offers unusual amenities, at least for New York: an 84-seat screening room and, in the guest rooms, wraparound lacquered desks, ergonomic chairs and access to the Web for people who like to work at odd hours of the day and night -- and can pay rates that start at $399.</p>
        <p>''The Sterns are catering to people who want to work with the art community, the film community, and the true art world isn't about navel rings and posturing,'' Mr. Tsao said. ''Artists go home at night and work.''</p>
        <p>The restaurant and room service offer grazing food like duck confit baklava and an L.A. omelet (no yolks) to both guests and visitors lounging on leather sofas and chenille slipper chairs.</p>
        <p>Of course, a few local naysayers, including Michael Sorkin, an architectural critic, would have preferred no building at all. ''It's a complete blight,'' he said. ''It's killing the view of the Empire State Building.''</p>
        <p>So, would he ever set foot in the hotel?</p>
        <p>''I dare say I'll be in the bar myself,'' he said. ''Location, location, location.''</p>
