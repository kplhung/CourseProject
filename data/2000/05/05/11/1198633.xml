        <p>China's chief arms negotiator said today that the American proposal to build an anti missile defensive shield posed an unacceptable threat to China's security and could force Beijing to significantly expand its own nuclear forces in response.</p>
        <p>The Chinese find it hard to believe American claims that the proposed ''national missile defense'' is intended only to counter threats from small ''rogue'' states like North Korea, said the official, Sha Zukang, in an interview. But whatever the intention, he said, the systems under discussion would destroy China's ability to deter nuclear attack by neutralizing its relatively small force of nuclear missiles.</p>
        <p>That would leave China dangerously vulnerable to bullying or attack, said Mr. Sha, the Foreign Ministry's director general for arms control. If that appears likely, he added, ''we will not sit on our hands.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sha and other Chinese officials have frequently voiced their strong opposition to American missile defense plans, but in the interview today, Mr. Sha, who spoke in English,  gave the most detailed public warning yet of China's possible military responses, ranging from producing more nuclear warheads to devising ways to undermine the American missile shield.</p>
        <p>''How can we base our own national security on your assurances of good will?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sha said that a ''balance of terror'' had kept nuclear peace for decades and remained the only realistic course until such weapons are phased out. The American proposal, he said, would spark a new global arms race and possibly what he called a ''nightmare scenario'' of weapons proliferation.</p>
        <p>Although the feasibility of the shield is not yet proved, President Clinton is under pressure to decide soon whether to embark on a crash program costing tens of billions of dollars to develop and deploy a system of sensors, missiles and futuristic weapons that could destroy a small number of incoming missiles.</p>
        <p>The proposal has been vehemently opposed by Russia, which like China fears the system would blunt its power and, like China, wants to avoid a costly arms race. In the debate in Washington so far, the Russian objections have received far greater attention than those from China, in part because deploying the defensive system would violate the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty signed by the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration has tried to persuade Russia to accept changes in the treaty that would permit a limited missile defense even as the two countries negotiate deeper, money-saving cuts in their huge nuclear arsenals.</p>
        <p>American officials have also sought to convince Russian military planners that the system contemplated, while adequate to stop a few missiles from a nation like Iraq or North Korea, could quickly be overwhelmed by Russia's missile forces.</p>
        <p>But the Americans cannot make that argument convincingly to China.  Since China developed nuclear weapons in the 1960's, it has avoided trying to match American and Soviet arsenals, instead keeping a small number of missiles as a minimal deterrent, able to retaliate in the event of attack. Western experts believe that China has no more than about two dozen land-based missiles, with one warhead each, capable of reaching the continental United States -- compared with thousands of warheads the United States could deliver by land- or sea-based missiles or bombers.</p>
        <p>American officials have not said how, in the event the missile defense plan goes ahead, they will deal with Beijing's objections or any major changes in its nuclear forces.</p>
        <p>In Washington, a State Department spokesman restated today the American position that national missile defense is not directed against China, but rather against the threat from countries with developing or potential missile programs, like North Korea, Iran and Iraq.</p>
        <p>''We've held meetings with the People's Republic of China,'' said the spokesman, Philip Reeker. ''They have expressed their concerns. We will continue our dialogue and efforts to explain the basis for any decision to deploy national missile defense.''</p>
        <p>Western intelligence agencies say that China is already developing newer, mobile ballistic missiles and improved warheads, but that they do not know whether it already plans a major expansion of forces.</p>
        <p>If the American missile defense plan proceeds, Mr. Sha said, ''We'll have to do something.'' The options, he said, include a significant increase in the number of nuclear warheads that China would field, improvements in the accuracy and other traits of warheads, and the development of methods to destroy or frustrate the missile shield.</p>
        <p>He said that China and Russia were discussing possible cooperation in developing techniques ''to restore strategic stability,'' including methods ''to defeat your system,'' but he declined to be more specific.</p>
        <p>''To defeat your defenses we'll have to spend a lot of money, and we don't want to do this,'' Mr. Sha said, adding that China's greater priority is economic development. ''But otherwise, the United States will feel it can attack anyone at any time, and that isn't tolerable.''</p>
        <p>China's equally fervent opposition to American and Japanese research on a ''theater missile defense'' for East Asia, which China fears might be extended to protect Taiwan, which it views as a breakaway province, has received considerable attention among Western military experts.</p>
        <p>Less widely understood, Mr. Sha said, is that an advanced missile defense in Asia would also serve as a forward line for the continental defensive shield. Putting long-range radars and other advanced devices in East Asia would give the United States the ability to detect and destroy Russian or Chinese missiles as they were launched, he said.</p>
        <p>''So this theater missile defense could be even more dangerous for Russia and China than the national missile defense,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sha described American fears of nuclear attack from countries like North Korea and Iraq as ''ridiculous.'' He said China estimates that it will be at least 15 years before North Korea can develop a missile able to reach the United States. He said that North Korea has no nuclear weapons and that strong diplomatic efforts can keep it that way -- and that in any case, North Korea would never launch an attack while it faces the certainty of massive retaliation.</p>
        <p>''The U.S. is a huge superpower and you're afraid of little North Korea?'' he said. ''Is it convincing?'' What is more plausible, he said, is that ''American strategic thinkers may have China in mind'' as they promote the missile defenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sha noted that even Washington's European allies are against the apparent American effort to insulate itself from nuclear dangers, fearing it could divide the alliance. ''Not a single significant country in the world supports this plan,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''We hope you'll give this up,'' Mr. Sha said. ''If not, we'll be ready.''</p>
