        <p>Antitrust Case Settlement Could Lower Prices of CD's  The Federal Trade Commission settled an antitrust case against the nation's five largest music companies that could result in significant price cuts for compact discs.</p>
        <p>Officials said the settlement completed a two-year investigation that found the companies used illegal marketing agreements to end a price war, inflate the prices of compact discs and sharply restrict the ability of retailers to offer discounts. Agency officials estimated that consumers were overcharged by $500 million over the last four years. [Page A1.]</p>

        <p>Antitrust Case Settlement Could Lower Prices of CD's  The Federal Trade Commission settled an antitrust case against the nation's five largest music companies that could result in significant price cuts for compact discs.</p>
        <p>Officials said the settlement completed a two-year investigation that found the companies used illegal marketing agreements to end a price war, inflate the prices of compact discs and sharply restrict the ability of retailers to offer discounts.

        <p>EBay Cancels the Sale of a Painting  EBay canceled the sale of a painting to a Dutch executive for $135,805, contending that the seller, Kenneth A. Walton, had violated its rules in a way that artificially inflated the sale price. The company also suspended three accounts that Mr. Walton used to trade art, accusing him of ''shill bidding,'' meaning that he entered bids on his own sales. [A1.]</p>
        <p>Dreyfus Settles Case for $3 Million  Dreyfus agreed to pay $2.95 million to settle charges that it failed to inform investors adequately about the risks of its Aggressive Growth Fund and that the fund's early performance had been manipulated by loading it with initial public offerings. In addition, the fund's former manager, Michael L. Schonberg, agreed to a nine-month suspension from the investment management business and will pay a $50,000 fine. [C11.]</p>
        <p>House Votes to Extend Moratorium  The House passed a bill to extend the current moratorium on new Internet taxes until 2006. The moratorium forbids states from trying to find new ways of taxing Internet use, like imposing taxes on monthly access charges for Internet service providers. The legislation does not directly address sales taxes. [C11.]</p>
        <p>From Secretary to Online Executive  John W. Sidgmore, the vice chairman of WorldCom and chief of its Uunet unit, has invested in and become chairman of eCommerce Industries, a dot-com venture for the office supply industry started by Paula Jagemann, his former secretary. The company intends to announce that it has formed the first electronic exchange to link office supply manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers. [C12.]</p>

        <p>Champion Shows Favor to a Suitor  Champion International embraced a sweetened $7.3 billion cash-and-stock bid from International Paper, starting a three-day clock for UPM-Kymmene of Finland to raise its $6.8 billion cash offer for Champion. The company said that its board had determined that the International Paper bid was superior after both suitors submitted revised offers. Shares of Champion rallied $6.4375, to $72.375. [C23.]</p>

        <p>A Government Role in the Economy  In the past, economic transformations were accompanied by enormous increases in spending on education, transportation, communications and, ultimately, technological research, much of it undertaken or subsidized by the government. The government now has a similar and crucial role to play in the new economy. Jeff Madrick: Economic Scene. [C2.]</p>
