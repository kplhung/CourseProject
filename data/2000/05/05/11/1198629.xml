        <p>Seven years after it first questioned the safety of saline breast implants, the Food and Drug Administration decided today to permit the two largest makers of implants to continue marketing the devices, despite new scientific evidence that they pose a significant risk of infection, tissue hardening and pain in the breast, as well as repeat surgeries.</p>
        <p>The government's approval of implants made by the McGhan Medical Corporation and the Mentor Corporation, both of Santa Barbara, Calif., came after five studies of more than 9,000 women documented what the drug agency described as relatively high rates of complications and rupture. The agency said it would require the companies to inform women of the risks.</p>
        <p>''Although there is benefit to some women from having breast implants available, there is now a much clearer understanding of the risks involved,'' said Dr. Jane E. Henney, commissioner of food and drugs, in a statement announcing the agency's decision. ''With the data that has been presented, women and their physicians will be able to make informed decisions about whether the benefits are worth the risks.''</p>
        <p>Saline implants have been sold in this country without Food and Drug Administration approval for more than three decades, long before the passage of a 1976 law that gave the agency authority to regulate medical devices. They have been the only type of implant commercially available since 1992, when the agency took silicone implants off the market amid great controversy about whether they caused autoimmune disorders. (An Institute of Medicine study concluded last year that they did not.)</p>
        <p>The saline implants were generally presumed safer than silicone implants, because they leak only salt water, as opposed to silicone gel, when they rupture. But while there has been an abundance of anecdotal evidence that all breast implants can cause hardening of breast tissue and other problems, until now there has been little scientific data about the extent of the risk from saline implants. So in 1993, amid questions about their safety, the drug agency announced it would require the companies to study the implants and apply for government approval.</p>
        <p>The studies by McGhan and Mentor made clear that many women who have saline implants will have to undergo additional surgeries because of rupture or other complications. McGhan's primary study involved 901 women who received saline-filled implants for cosmetic reasons, and, like all the studies, looked at the various short-term or ''local'' complications that have long been known to be associated with breast implants.</p>
        <p>After three years, 689 women were still in the study. About one-fifth, or 21 percent, required additional surgeries; 9 percent suffered a hardening of the tissue around the implant (a condition known as capsular contracture); 16 percent experienced breast pain; 8 percent asked for their implants to be removed and 5 percent experienced leakage or deflation of the device. The rates of complications were roughly the same in a study of 1,264 women who received Mentor implants.</p>
        <p>But the risks of complications were higher for women who received implants for reconstruction after breast cancer surgery or other medical problems, in part because the lack of an intact breast makes it difficult for doctors to put the implants in. Among 416 women receiving Mentor implants for breast reconstruction, 40 percent needed additional surgeries, 27 percent asked that the implants be removed and 9 percent experienced leakage and deflation. In all the studies, some women experienced more than one complication.</p>
        <p>An estimated 150,000 women obtained saline implants last year; McGhan, a subsidiary of the Inamed Corporation, and Mentor, sold the vast majority of the devices. Three smaller implant manufacturers are also seeking agency approval.</p>
        <p>Officials at Mentor declined to comment on the agency's action today. But Scott Eschbach, the president and chief executive of McGhan, said he was pleased with the agency's decision, and characterized it as a determination by the government that the implants are ''safe and effective.'' Mr. Eschbach said, ''I think they made a wise decision.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a Washington advocacy organization that had petitioned the agency to regulate saline implants, said the studies conducted by McGhan and Mentor hardly prove safety and effectiveness. He strongly criticized the agency's action today.</p>
        <p>''One can't think of any other medical device that has been allowed to stay on the market with such a high failure rate,'' Dr. Wolfe said. ''It is yielding to the device companies and guaranteeing harm to women.''</p>
        <p>Dr. David Feigal, director of the agency's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, defended the decision today, saying women are capable of reviewing the data and making their own choices.</p>
        <p>''This is a product that there is a strong consumer interest in,'' Dr. Feigal said. ''If you look at the kinds of problems that we have characterized as complications, they are cosmetic complications. That's not to say that they aren't important or distressing. But now we have the ability for people to actually see what they are getting into, and make the choice in that light.''</p>
