        <p>Thousands of panicky men, women and children fled toward the capital today, carrying loads on their heads or scrambling to board jammed buses, as fighting edged closer to the capital.</p>
        <p>This junction, about 10 miles east of the center of the capital, Freetown, was the scene of intense confusion this morning. As civilians streamed toward the capital, which remained under the control of an embattled United Nations force, vehicles filled with pro-government militiamen rumbled away from town, toward the fighting with the Revolutionary United Front.</p>
        <p>''We are expecting the rebels to come from the Waterloo direction -- there is only one route,'' said Lt. Joseph Jalloh of the Sierra Leone Army. Waterloo is five miles away. ''We are trying to stop them from coming to Freetown.''</p>
        <p>As the confusion intensified, the whereabouts of Foday Sankoh, the leader of the Revolutionary United Front, remained unclear. His absence complicates efforts to negotiate the release of 500 United Nations peacekeepers and civilians being held by the rebels.</p>
        <p>The rebels have rapidly advanced westward toward the capital in recent days. And the United Nations mission, whose mandate had been to keep the peace as a neutral force, has essentially become allied with the Sierra Leonean army and a militia known as the Kamajors to stave off a rebel assault on Freetown.</p>
        <p>''It is now the goal of our force to preserve the stability and peace in Freetown,'' said Bernard Miyet, the United Nations under secretary general for peacekeeping, at the end of a two-day visit to Sierra Leone. ''It is our immediate priority.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Miyet said the United Nations was committed to staying in Sierra Leone. ''I have not come here to shut down this operation,'' he said. ''I have come to see how we can preserve peace for a population that deserves peace.''</p>
        <p>It is the second time since the beginning of last year that Freetown, at the western end of a peninsula in the Atlantic Ocean, has faced a possible invasion. In a fierce attack in January 1999, the Revolutionary United Front, then allied with ex-government soldiers, pushed into the center of town, burning houses, raping women and girls, killings thousands and hacking off the hands and arms of hundreds.</p>
        <p>The advance of rebels with a brutal past has caused panic among Sierra Leoneans. Since Tuesday, when United Nations peacekeepers abandoned Masiaka, a junction town about 25 miles east of here, civilians have been fleeing westward.</p>
        <p>The sight of thousands traveling by foot, bicycle and vehicle, carrying clothes, gasoline containers, mattresses, and pots and pans, appeared to have heightened fears in villages and towns as they made their way.</p>
        <p>''All the people from Waterloo are leaving,'' said Samuel Fofanah, 25, a teacher at Peninsula Secondary School who left Waterloo on his bicycle early this morning. ''We heard gunshots.''</p>
        <p>Those passing through Jui Junction included Abraham, 9, who was as old as Sierra Leone's war. Abraham, whose hands were hacked off by the Revolutionary United Front during an attack on Waterloo in January 1999, was carrying a large nylon bag on his head, steadying it with the stumps of his arms. He and his father had walked from Waterloo this morning.</p>
        <p>James Kargbo, a 26-year-old high school student in Waterloo, had fled to Freetown on Monday with most of his belongings. He was trying to return today to Waterloo, but then learned that soldiers were no longer permitting civilians to travel east of here.</p>
        <p>''I left behind many important items, like my books,'' Mr. Kargbo said, as he sat on a flatbed pickup truck with a small radio glued to his left ear. ''I am a student.''</p>
        <p>People who could afford it spent 500 leones, or 25 cents, to buy a seat in a bus or station wagon.</p>
        <p>Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, the head of a junta that toppled the government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in 1997 but who is now allied with him, claimed on a Freetown radio station that his men had taken back Masiaka. The news, though, could not be confirmed and did not halt the exodus toward the capital.</p>
        <p>Truckloads of Kamajors, a militia that is allied with the government and is made up of young men who wear charms that they believe will ward off bullets, passed by the checkpoint here. ''Foday Sankoh, you cannot go scot-free!'' one truckload of young men sang in pidgin English.</p>
        <p>At one point, scores of Kamajors arrived, angry and hungry, claiming to have come from the front line.</p>
        <p>Their ammunition was faulty, they complained to the Sierra Leonean soldiers, asking for more.</p>
        <p>''There is no food!'' one of them said. ''No water.''</p>
