        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report (news article, May 10) that Police Commissioner Howard  Safir announced that he had prostate cancer, just a week and a half after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani learned that he had the disease. As a cancer survivor of nine years, I know that the waiting before a treatment plan is in place is the hardest time of all. In most cases, the therapy is not as bad as one thinks, and there are treatments for side effects.</p>

        <p>You report (news article, May 10) that Police Commissioner Howard  Safir announced that he had prostate cancer, just a week and a half after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani learned that he had the disease. As a cancer survivor of nine years, I know that the waiting before a treatment plan is in place is the hardest time of all. In most cases, the therapy is not as bad as one thinks, and there are treatments for side effects.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Safir got a routine blood test that detected the cancer at an early stage, permitting treatment before the malignancy can spread. Do they realize that preventive health care is a luxury out of reach of the thousands of New Yorkers who lack a health care plan?</p>
        <p>Emergency rooms, where most of the poor are treated, don't do such screening. As a powerful force in the city's health care drama, the mayor should make early detection a possibility for every at-risk man in New York City.</p>
