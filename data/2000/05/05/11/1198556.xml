        <p>The first Italian couple to fight the medical establishment, as well as Italy's legal system, and win approval for surrogate motherhood gave up this week and are seeking other avenues abroad, their doctor said today.</p>
        <p>The case was widely followed in Italy, where a bill that would sharply limit artificially assisted pregnancies has been blocked in the Senate for a year. The measure has revived a passionate debate about fertility, Italian-style. Italy has one of the lowest birthrates in the industrialized world and some of the most advanced infertility treatments.</p>
        <p>But the Roman Catholic church, conservative political groups and the Italian Medical Association are seeking to restrict technological methods.</p>
        <p>''In this case, common sense prevailed,'' the president of the group, Aldo Pagni, said on Tuesday after reports that the couple had decided to leave. ''Recent contested cases about surrogate motherhood show the confusion that is created in society to the detriment of the unborn child.''</p>
        <p>The couple, who have remained anonymous, were the first in Italy to obtain a judge's consent to use a surrogate, which in their case involved implanting the embryo into another woman's womb.</p>
        <p>More than five years ago, they learned that the wife suffered a rare congenital malformation that left her without a uterus, although she was able to produce eggs. In 1995, their doctor, Pasquale Bilotta, used artificial insemination to fertilize her eggs and froze the embyro until they could find a surrogate.</p>
        <p>Last year, the couple found a woman who was willing to help. But by then the medical association had blocked Dr. Bilotta from performing the procedure. In 1995, the group issued its code of bioethics, which prohibits surrogate motherhood.</p>
        <p>The couple took their case to court. In February, a Roman judge decided in their favor. The association appealed, but an appeals court upheld the judge's decision.</p>
        <p>The decision would not have set a precedent in Italian law, and the couple's legal standing seemed uncertain.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bilotta explained that the furor also proved so daunting that the two decided to give up on the process in Italy and went abroad. ''The clamor was so intense,'' he said. ''There was so much negative pressure from the church, Catholic politicians and the medical establishment, they decided to go abroad.''</p>
        <p>He declined to say where exactly they went. Seven states in the United States have clear laws that permit surrogate motherhood. But in Western Europe, just England allows it.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bilotta said the couple were also worried about the legal status of their child after it was born.</p>
        <p>Italy has no law on artificial fertility. Many critics complained about possible abuses in private clinics. Last year, the center-left majority in Parliament wrote a draft bill that sought to improve the regulation of private clinics and broaden couples' choices. But Catholic and center-right politicians reworked the draft, imposing harsh restrictions.</p>
        <p>The draft, now blocked in a Senate committee, sets prison terms for doctors who use donor sperm in artificial inseminations. The bill would also prohibit surrogate motherhood.</p>
        <p>''The Italian medical leadership say they are acting on behalf of the child,'' Dr. Bilotta said. ''But they are totally ignorant about the realities of surrogate motherhood.''</p>
