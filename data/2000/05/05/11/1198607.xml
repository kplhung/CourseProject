        <p>The American Physical Society, the world's largest group of physicists, faulted the Pentagon's test program for its antimissile defense system yesterday as ''far short'' of what the president needed to make an informed decision about whether the proposed weapon could actually shoot down enemy warheads.</p>
        <p>After an interception test in June, President Clinton intends to decide if the nation should build a limited defense against missile attacks by rogue states.</p>
        <p>Estimates for the system's cost run as high as $60 billion.</p>
        <p>The group focused on what it called meager testing of possible ways an enemy might outwit the proposed weapon system, which would consist initially of 100 ground-based interceptors.</p>
        <p>The United States, it said, should make no decision to build a national missile defense system unless it is shown ''to be effective against the types of offensive countermeasures that an attacker could reasonably be expected to deploy with its long-range missiles.''</p>
        <p>Such demonstrations, it said, could be achieved through analysis and interception flight tests.</p>
        <p>The group, which is based in Washington, added that tests the Pentagon has either conducted or scheduled before the president's decision ''fall far short of those required to provide confidence'' in the system's technical feasibility.</p>
        <p>A Pentagon spokesman said the group had ignored ''literally a mountain'' of antimissile research.</p>
        <p>''We're very confident that our test data will allow the president to make an informed decision,'' said Lt. Col. Richard Lehner of the Air Force.</p>
