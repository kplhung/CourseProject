        <p>Citing the confidentiality of medical information, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled this week that New York state psychiatrists cannot attach extensive mental health records to their official recommendations on whether criminal defendants are competent to stand trial.</p>
        <p>The order, by Judge William H. Pauley 3rd of Federal District Court in Manhattan, only affects defendants who were found mentally incompetent and then received treatment in a state psychiatric hospital. The judge determined that by providing treatment to restore the defendant's competence, state mental health workers established a confidential relationship with the defendant under New York state law.</p>
        <p>It is not uncommon for mentally ill defendants to fail an initial competency evaluation and then respond to treatment, according to Mental Hygiene Legal Services, the legal agency that sued New York state on behalf of the defendants.</p>
        <p>In a preliminary injunction issued on Tuesday, Judge Pauley balanced the defendant's right to medical confidentiality against the state's need to determine fitness for trial. After reviewing evidence presented by Mental Hygiene Legal Services, the judge found that records attached to competence reports often contained personal information that did not always relate directly to mental competence. The judge wrote that state mental health officials should confine their recommendations to a standardized court form and should not attach the additional records.</p>
        <p>Judge Pauley found that trial judges did not always need extensive psychiatric records to determine whether a trial could go forward. Although he recognized the state courts' need to establish a defendant's mental fitness for trial, the judge wrote, ''the fitness reports reveal far more information than is required by any court.''</p>
        <p>In its lawsuit, Mental Hygiene Legal Service, a state agency that represents patients in psychiatric hospitals, claimed that confidential patient records were routinely attached to forms that were then placed in public court files, and that making the records available to the public violated defendants' constitutional right to privacy. Lawyers for the State Office of Mental Health denied that the records were made public, saying they were stamped confidential and were only for the judge's use.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for Mental Hygiene Legal Services also said the records attached to the competency reports often had little to do with the defendant's ability to understand legal proceedings, and included personal information like sexual orientation, and past medical illnesses.</p>
        <p>While only one state hospital, Mid-Hudson Forensic Psychiatric Center, was cited in the legal papers, a spokesman for the State Office of Mental Health said psychiatrists at all of the state's high-security psychiatric hospitals would follow the court's guidelines. Mid-Hudson is the largest such facility in New York, with 286 patients.</p>
        <p>As a preliminary injunction, the judge's order is not the final determination in the case. Dennis D. Feld, a lawyer for Mental Hygiene Legal Services, said he expected the case to go to trial in several months. Roger F. Klingman, spokesman for the Office of Mental Health, said his department is reviewing the judge's order and has not determined whether it will appeal the injunction.</p>
        <p>To support their argument, the Mental Hygiene Legal Services lawyers filed the reports for four defendants, who were only identified by their initials. The reports included information on H.I.V. status, sexual matters and family history.</p>
        <p>''The fact that a criminal defendant is H.I.V. positive and bisexual, was physically abused 14 years earlier, takes H.I.V.-related medication and suffers from hepatitis and diabetes, or has siblings who served time in prison, is not essential information which a court must have before determining that a defendant has sufficient ability to consult with his lawyers or to understand the proceedings against him,'' the judge wrote.</p>
        <p>Judge Pauley also wrote that providing the detailed psychiatric records undermined the medical relationship between the state psychiatrists and the defendants by ''enlisting the treating therapist as a prosecutorial agent.'' He said that state law purposely separates the evaluation of a defendant's capacity from treatment for mental illness to avoid such conflicts.</p>
