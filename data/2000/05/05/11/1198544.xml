        <p>Sometimes it is better to wage war than to agree to an unstable and unworkable peace, a proposition that the current crisis in Sierra Leone bears out.</p>
        <p>A peace agreement signed in July 1999 was supposed to help rebuild Sierra Leone by installing a coalition government, composed of the current president, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, and Foday Sankoh, the ruthless leader of the main rebel group.</p>
        <p>Under the accord, Mr. Sankoh became a vice president and commissioner of diamond resources, the country's main source of income. Three of his lieutenants became ministers of government. All were offered a blanket amnesty for past crimes. In exchange, United Nations peacekeepers were to take the weapons of all combatants. Instead, the rebels have captured and disarmed 500 peacekeepers, and the country is in chaos once again.</p>
        <p>This agreement failed for several related reasons. It mistakenly assumed that the rebels were interested in peace, let alone had an interest in real governing. It assumed that there was a civil war and treated Mr. Sankoh as a legitimate champion of the rural poor, whose interests he claimed to represent. In reality, Mr. Sankoh is not rebelling in any political sense. He has been interested only in taking advantage of a corrupt state that had collapsed.</p>
        <p>So, from the rebels' point of view, why have peace when it is the absence of law and order that enables one to loot? Why let peacekeeping troops enter the country's diamond mining area if one is profiting from the sale of these riches on the black market?</p>
        <p>In fact, the rebels never had any intention of honoring the peace accord; they were only interested in waging war and looting the country.  The United Nations, so reflexively attached to the mantra of peace at any price, sent peacekeeping troops when there was no peace to keep. The United Nations and the State Department, which helped negotiate the peace accord, should have known better. As recently as March 1999, the United Nations Security Council had threatened to prosecute Mr. Sankoh for war crimes. Earlier, a State Department report on Sierra Leone had noted the discovery of civilian mass graves in areas where the rebels had attacked.</p>
        <p>Why would the United Nations and the United States agree to a power-sharing agreement with Mr. Sankoh, whose forces have killed, raped and maimed tens of thousands of men, women and even children?</p>
        <p>The answer can be found in President Clinton's statement during his April 1999 visit to Rwanda, when he lamented the lack of United States action to stop the genocide there. After this speech, the Clinton administration wanted to show that it cared about human rights in Africa. Engineering a peace accord in Sierra Leone, however slapdash, sent the desired message.</p>
        <p>In the last few days, Nigeria has agreed to send its own forces back to Sierra Leone, provided the West pays their costs. The West should jump at this, not only because these soldiers are likely to be better equipped and trained than the United Nations forces, but because they can fight back.</p>
        <p>Unconstrained by the rules of peacekeeping, the Nigerians can wage war against the rebels. And Nigeria, unlike the West, has national interests at stake. Trouble anywhere in West Africa is a threat to its stability.</p>
        <p>The peace agreement in Sierra Leone was quick and cheap, but doomed. Let us hope that the West now recognizes this -- and doesn't opt for a second try at an accord.</p>
