        <p>While continuing to reject the antitrust findings against it, the Microsoft Corporation today offered a series of narrow restrictions on its behavior that it said would be more appropriate remedies than breaking up the company.</p>
        <p>Microsoft also asked the judge to  throw out the government's breakup proposal immediately, arguing that ''the laws and the facts do not support such a radical step.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft's counterproposal is a four-year plan largely governing its relations with computer makers and software developers.</p>
        <p>In its court filing, Microsoft said that if the government's breakup plan were adopted, its employees might ''leave the company in droves.''</p>
        <p>If that were to happen, Microsoft continued, ''the company's entire business would be destroyed.'' [Excerpts, Page C6.]</p>
        <p>Such passages seemed clearly intended to warn Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that splitting up Microsoft would be a dangerous gamble to take with a pillar of the nation's high-technology economy. [News analysis, Page C1.]</p>
        <p>''We believe there is no basis for the government's unprecedented breakup proposal,'' said William H. Gates, the company's chairman, ''and we are hopeful that the court will dismiss this excessive demand immediately.''</p>
        <p>The motion for summary rejection was added unexpectedly to the company's formal response to the remedy proposal offered last month by the Justice Department and 17 states. In the motion, Microsoft argued that since the company achieved its monopoly position by legal means, the government had no right ''to dismember Microsoft.''</p>
        <p>After four years of investigation and 19 months of litigation, the Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general proposed on April 28 that Microsoft be broken into two companies. One would hold the Windows operating system, the other everything else, including the Office suite of application programs like Word and Excel. Two of the 19 states joining in the suit -- Ohio and Illinois -- advocated steps short of a breakup.</p>
        <p>Judge Jackson ruled on April 3 that Microsoft was in wide violation of the nation's antitrust laws. But if he chose to break up the company, it would be one of only a few instances  the last hundred years when a major national company was broken apart as a result of an antitrust case -- and the only one resulting from court order rather than a consent decree.</p>
        <p>Next Wednesday, the federal and state governments are entitled to reply to today's filing from Microsoft. And then during a remedies hearing on May 24, both the government and Microsoft will offer arguments in support of their proposals.</p>
        <p>In a statement today, the Justice Department said that ''Microsoft's proposal is ineffective and filled with loopholes.'' Among the loopholes, the department added, the proposal would not prevent ''attempts to divide markets with competitors; retaliation against personal computer manufacturers and software developers that support non-Microsoft technologies; or tying to require PC manufacturers to ship other Microsoft products with Windows.''</p>
        <p>And Attorney General Tom Miller of Iowa, who leads the states that are joining in the suit, said: ''The remedies proposed are inadequate. These measures would not have prevented the serious violations of law found by Judge Jackson, and they are not adequate remedies to assure that the law is not broken in the future.''</p>
        <p>In the past, Microsoft's leaders  repeatedly said there was a ''church and state'' separation within the company between the Windows group and the others that develop applications programs like Office.</p>
        <p>But in today's filing, Microsoft said: ''Cross-pollination between engineers working on different products such as Windows and Office has led to numerous innovations.''</p>
        <p>It added that the company's success and attendant benefits for consumers ''would not have been possible but for Microsoft's unified structure, which enables Microsoft to conceive and implement new ideas that span operating systems and applications.''</p>
        <p>As part of today's filing, Microsoft offered its own proposed remedies, a collection of rules that would modify the company's conduct, while reiterating its conviction to appeal the case, even if its remedy proposal were accepted.</p>
        <p>Many of the company's proposals are similar to those in the government plan, though they are more narrowly focused on specific complaints raised in the trial. Along with the breakup plan, the government wants to impose about a dozen rules intended to moderate Microsoft's conduct.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's proposed conduct restrictions fall far short of the government's, and the company explained: ''Courts are not authorized in civil enforcement proceedings to punish antitrust defendants. Instead, relief must extend no farther than is necessary to redress the conduct found to be unlawful.''</p>
        <p>Still, the proposal included several significant concessions. Among them, the company would have to take the following steps:</p>
        <p>*Agree not to discriminate in the release of technical information about Windows to outside software developers.</p>
        <p>*Allow computer manufacturers to make ''non-Microsoft Web browsing software the default browser on a new personal computer.''</p>
        <p>*Agree not to threaten to withhold a license for Windows from a computer maker featuring products by a Microsoft competitor.</p>
        <p>*Enter into no exclusive deals that offer other companies favored treatment in Windows in exchange for agreements to feature only Microsoft products.</p>
        <p>*Agree not to condition the release of its software intended for non-Microsoft operating systems, like Apple Computer's, on the other company's agreement not to distribute or promote competitors' software.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department complained in its statement that Microsoft's remedies would not ''prevent the company from using its monopoly power in the future to engage in the same kind of illegal behavior to crush new innovations.'' And the department promoted its own plan, saying it would ''address the serious violations found by the court'' by ''stimulating competition and innovation, leading to better products and lower prices for consumers.''</p>
        <p>Among the government's additional remedy proposals are a requirement that Microsoft, if it adds certain new programs or features to Windows, sell a version of Windows at a discount with that new feature hidden or removed; a requirement that Microsoft publish a uniform price list for Windows; and a ban on design strategies that are intended to compromise or disable other programs that run on Windows.</p>
        <p>Microsoft also offered a schedule for remedy hearings, a sliding scale that calls for longer proceedings if the judge chooses to consider the government remedy proposals that Microsoft considers most onerous.</p>
        <p>If Judge Jackson chooses to consider the government's plan to break up the company, Microsoft said it would need six months to prepare for an extensive remedies trial that would begin in early December.</p>
        <p>Other options -- accepting some parts of the government plan but not others -- would bring delays of weeks or months, under the Microsoft plan.</p>
        <p>While attending a convention in New Orleans today, Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, said: ''Our company will not be broken up. It will not happen.''</p>
        <p>Judge Jackson has said he wants to complete the remedy phase by the end of this month. But Microsoft lawyers made clear when Judge Jackson proposed his fast-track timetable last month that the company could not agree until it had seen the government plan.</p>
        <p>Microsoft cited one government demand as one justification for its proposed delays: a proposal requiring Microsoft to share technical information about Windows with other software companies that is far more sweeping than Microsoft's plan.</p>
        <p>''The need for deliberate procedures is especially strong because much of the intellectual property the government seeks to confiscate relates to products and technologies, such as Windows 2000, that were not even mentioned at trial,'' one of the company's briefs says. ''If the company intends to consider such draconian relief, Microsoft is entitled to address these new issues fully and completely.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates said, ''The government's proposal would take away Microsoft's property'' even though ''Microsoft spent millions of dollars to develop these products.''</p>
        <p>Throughout the Microsoft documents, the company makes the case that it is a national asset, central to the nation's economy, so that disturbing Microsoft would be unfortunate for both the American people and the economy.</p>
        <p>''The public has reaped substantial benefits from Microsoft's development of Windows and other software products,'' the company said. ''Indeed it is no exaggeration to say that the entire United States economy has benefited from Microsoft's efforts. Such benefits would be put at risk were this court to order that Microsoft be broken up into separate companies.''</p>
        <p>Before the filing, Microsoft's stock fell $1.625, to $66.1875, on the Nasdaq market. In after-hours trading, the shares dipped as low as $65, reaching the company's 52-week low, before rising slightly to $65.50.</p>
