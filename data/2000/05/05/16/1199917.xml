        <p>Casting the overhaul of the Social Security system as a ''test of presidential candidates,'' Gov. George W. Bush today proposed a fundamental change in the retirement system that would allow workers to choose how to invest some of their payroll taxes.</p>
        <p>With his formal call for the introduction of individual retirement accounts, Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, began a debate that could dominate the campaign. He and Vice President Al Gore differ sharply over how to meet the fiscal challenge posed by the retirement of baby boomers.</p>
        <p>Although Social Security has long been considered the ''third rail'' of politics that a candidate touches at his peril, Mr. Bush took a gamble that in the new economy, with nearly 50 percent of American households now owning stock, his proposal would prove appealing.</p>
        <p>''There is a fundamental difference between my opponent and me,'' Mr. Bush said in an appearance at a center for the elderly here. ''He trusts the government to manage our retirement. I trust individual Americans.'' [Excerpts, Page A18.]</p>
        <p>''I trust Americans to make their own decisions and manage their own money,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also embraced a bipartisan proposal for Medicare that would reshape it by giving beneficiaries fixed amounts of money to choose from various health plans.</p>
        <p>A few hours later outside Philadelphia, Mr. Gore came out squarely against the plan, calling it dangerous for individual taxpayers and for the economy overall. ''If we turn the Social Security system into a system of winners and losers,'' he said, ''we will be jeopardizing retirement security for too many Americans, and in the end we will all have to pay to make up the differences.''</p>
        <p>The sharp debate comes at a time when demographic changes will soon threaten the solvency of Social Security. The retirement system will start paying out more in benefits than it is taking in in payroll taxes starting in 2015 because of the retirement of the baby-boom generation. Under current projections, by 2037 it will be able to pay out only 75 percent in benefits.</p>
        <p>Shifting some of the payroll tax into individual retirement accounts would amount to the most far-reaching change in Social Security since its inception in the Depression. As Social Security has worked for decades, current retirees are paid from the payroll taxes of current workers; under the Bush plan, workers would be able to use a portion of their payroll taxes and invest them for their own retirement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush argued that it would both provide an infusion of cash to make the system solvent and give people ''the security of ownership.''</p>
        <p>But he largely skirted specifics, preferring to talk about broad principles. It was unclear, for instance, exactly how much money people could set aside for individual accounts and what sort of investment options they would have. Mr. Bush did say the investments would have to be in ''steady, reliable funds,'' adding that ''there will be no fly-by-night speculators or day trading.''</p>
        <p>He also pledged that benefits would not change for current retirees and those who are near retirement. He said he would dedicate the entire $2 trillion Social Security surplus to the retirement program. He ruled out any increase in payroll taxes, but was silent on whether to raise the retirement age.</p>
        <p>Much of the Texas Republican's address was devoted to drawing a contrast between himself and Vice President Gore, casting himself as a leader who would pave the way for a bipartisan agreement on a pressing policy matter.</p>
        <p>''I am here with a message for America and to put my opponent on notice,'' Mr. Bush said. ''The days of spreading fear and panic are over. The days of delaying, dividing, demagoguing are over. When I am elected, this generation and this president will solve Social Security.''</p>
        <p>He said that President Clinton and Mr. Gore had squandered eight years when they could have addressed the problems posed by the baby boomers. ''At a time for leadership, for long-term thinking, my opponent proposes a Band-Aid approach,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He says and I quote, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' But in the lifetime of some people in this room, it will be broke and we must fix it. With every day of delay this becomes more difficult.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has in large part staked his candidacy on the health of the economy and made paying down the debt the centerpiece of his economic plan. He has proposed extending the life of Social Security until 2054 by devoting the interest saved in paying down the debt to the retirement system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, in his own appearance, asked what would happen to investments if economic prosperity abated. ''Today, when Wall Street is booming, I know that plan sounds appealing,'' he said. ''It probably sounds like an easy way to make more money and have more control over your retirement. But in reality, the Bush privatization plan would weaken our economy and undermine the basic guarantee of a minimum basic retirement.''</p>
        <p>Asked later about his lack of detail, Mr. Bush called his speech ''pretty darned detailed to be talking about a framework to get something done.'' His aides said he had avoided specifics because Hillary Rodham Clinton's abortive effort to craft a plan for universal health coverage had shown that being locked into one plan was a recipe for legislative disaster on a complicated issue.</p>
        <p>But the lack of specifics on matters like what percentage of payroll tax would go to accounts and what age group would see the change opened Mr. Bush to charges that he was masking some of the hard choices ahead and trying to sidestep questions about how he could afford the transition as well as his sweeping call for a $1.3 trillion tax cut in the next decade.</p>
        <p>The costs of making the transition to such a system would be significant -- as much as $1 trillion -- because the government could have to pay out full benefits to current retirees at the same time that some amount of payroll taxes were being diverted into individual accounts.</p>
        <p>Supporters of Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore feuded all day over which plan was more risky and which would entail more of a shift of general tax revenue into Social Security. Such a shift would require cuts in other programs or could lead to tax increases.</p>
        <p>The vice president asserted that Mr. Bush's plan would make it nearly impossible to pay down the national debt. ''By leaving us with a multitrillion dollar debt for as far as the eye can see, the Bush plan could trigger higher interest rates and slower long-term growth,'' Mr. Gore said. ''That undermines our chance to meet other challenges, such as keeping Medicare solvent or providing an affordable prescription drug benefit for seniors.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has been lagging in recent polls and his advisers said privately they were pleased that Mr. Bush had taken on Social Security because it set up a clear policy difference between the candidates and provided a big target to shoot at, much like former Senator Bill Bradley's universal health care plan in the Democratic primaries.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Gore intends to talk about Social Security two more times this week, before younger voters at Fordham University in New York on Tuesday and before older voters in Florida on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>In the past few years an array of Republicans and Democrats have proposed Social Security overhaul plans that include an element of private accounts. But the ideas have all died because of sharp ideological differences, distrust between the parties and fear of alienating the elderly, who are a reliable voting bloc.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's advisers, however, believe that the politics of Social Security is changing and that their plan will appeal to younger voters who are comfortable with the market and doubt that the government will provide a secure retirement.</p>
        <p>Generally the plans would allow 2 percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax to be put into individual accounts. But the programs differ quite significantly in the details.</p>
        <p>Because of the economic complexities involved, a number of them also call for benefit reductions like raising the retirement age or scaling back cost of living increases. And under one plan workers would have to return their accounts to the government when they retired and then receive a fixed monthly sum back.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Bush also expressed support for an approach to Medicare that had been drafted by a bipartisan commission, which would have converted Medicare into an arena for public and private competition. The approach would have given each beneficiary a fixed amount of cash to use when choosing from public and private health care plans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said the elderly should be given a choice of health plans to buy, including one providing prescription drug coverage. He said Medicare itself should provide full drug coverage for the most low-income elderly.</p>
