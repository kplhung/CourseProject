        <p>Whether sparked by lightning, a carelessly tossed cigarette or a prescribed burn like the one now flaring out of control, a catastrophic wildfire threatening Los Alamos National Laboratory was bound to happen.</p>
        <p>A 1998 report by officials at the Santa Fe National Forest in northern New Mexico, which borders the area, warned that the next five years held a 30 percent chance of a fire exceeding 5,000 acres striking the dense ponderosa pine forests on the western flank of the laboratory -- just as is now happening.</p>
        <p>And an appendix of an environmental impact report last year by the Department of Energy describes a situation eerily like the one in progress: a fire starting southwest of the laboratory during a bone-dry spring, swept by winds toward the town and laboratory. ''A major fire moving up to the edge of L.A.N.L. is not only credible but likely,'' the report concluded.</p>
        <p>The implication of both studies, first reported in Forest magazine last fall, is that something like the current wildfire was only a matter of time.</p>
        <p>Two other devastating fires have raged around Los Alamos in 23 years. The first, the La Mesa fire in 1977, burned 15,270 acres and jumped onto laboratory property; the second, the Dome Fire in 1996, burned 16,500 acres, reaching the edge of the laboratory.</p>
        <p>Moreover, in a region of spectacular summer thunderstorms, lightning ignited an estimated 372 ''fire starts'' from 1975 to 1996 in 40,000 acres of forests surrounding Los Alamos.</p>
        <p>The current fire, which has destroyed more than 400 housing units in the town of Los Alamos, began on May 4 when Park Service officials ignited brush on a ridge to eliminate some dry wood and debris that could feed a rampaging natural blaze.</p>
        <p>The fire was set despite National Weather Service forecasts of high winds and low humidity that could make the fire difficult to control. On the six-point Haines index, used to help measure volatility, the Weather Service estimated conditions at six.</p>
        <p>Windy conditions are not unusual in the area. The Energy Department report found that there was frequently a good chance of winds capable of spreading a fire beyond control.</p>
        <p>These factors are particularly hazardous in dense, dry ponderosa pine forests like those around Los Alamos. A century of suppressing naturally caused wildfires has helped lead to arboreal growth that is among the most plentiful in the Southwest. At the turn of the 20th century, said Wallace Covington, a professor at Northern Arizona University's School of Forestry in Flagstaff, there were an estimated 20 to 60 trees an acre. Now there are 300 to 900.</p>
        <p>This overcrowding was also aided by large-scale grazing after the coming of railroads in the late 19th century. With little grass left to compete with, pine seedlings flourished.</p>
        <p>Tree ring studies show that when the forests were sparser, grass fires swept through uneventfully every few years. But with overgrazing, grass was replaced by a thick carpet of explosive pine needles -- the bottom rung of a fire ladder that sweeps flames upward instead of outward, climbing right to the tops of the towering ponderosas.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department said it had begun to act on the warnings, clearing large areas of brush. ''A fair amount of precautions have been taken very recently,'' said Lisa Cutler, a department spokeswoman. But Dr. Covington said a far more extensive effort of thinning the thick forests beyond the laboratory might have made all the difference.</p>
        <p>''If that kind of project had been put into effect around Los Alamos, that would have stopped the fire well before it got into town,'' he said.</p>
