        <p>When Millicent Gillespie pulled the 38-page Census 2000 form out of her mailbox, on 171st Street in Jamaica, Queens, she tossed it in the trash.</p>
        <p>First of all, the questionnaire, which arrived in March, was too long -- like a book, she said -- and the questions struck her as too personal and, in a few instances, simply ridiculous.</p>
        <p>But there was more to Mrs. Gillespie's reluctance to fill out the form and mail it back: she has no faith in the government. And when she explained her reasoning, Mrs. Gillespie, a special education teacher at a nearby school, repeated the views of many of her neighbors in Census Tract 414, a quarter-mile slice of southeastern Queens.</p>
        <p>The middle-class neighborhood of 3,800 people, 89 percent of them black, borders affluent St. Albans but is not far from dirt-poor pockets of Jamaica, with some of the borough's fanciest and most downtrodden blocks just around the corner.</p>
        <p>A lot has changed in Tract 414 since the 1990 census. Renovated duplexes and newly constructed homes and churches are visible now on almost every block, on the same streets that at the end of the 1980's were lined with burned-out buildings or abandoned homes and swarming with drug dealers.</p>
        <p>Another big change in the neighborhood was participation in the census, which plunged in Tract 414 to 33 percent of households mailing in their forms this year from 46 percent in 1990, according to a New York Times analysis of 2000 census data collected so far. Low responses to the 2000 census in tracts like 414 helped drag down the citywide response in black neighborhoods to under 40 percent, the analysis showed, a decline of five percentage points over 1990, which is a sharp drop in the census-taking world.</p>
        <p>The low response rate in black neighborhoods appeared to be well below this year's response among other races, both nationally and in New York City and State. Only one other city, Baltimore, saw such a notable decline in the response among black residents, according to census officials, who were mulling over preliminary census data last week and said they could not yet give an explanation for the decline in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>Census officials say they were puzzled by results from New York City's black population, which were calculated by analyzing the initial response rates from largely black neighborhoods. Late last month they reported significantly higher responses this year from largely black cities like Detroit and Oakland, Calif., and, on average, no decline among blacks elsewhere in New York State or across the country. An unusually high response among minority members, particularly Hispanics, helped lift the national response rate to about 66 percent, exceeding the bureau's expectations after dramatic declines that began with the 1980 count, officials said.</p>
        <p>''It'll be studied for the next 10 years,'' Steve Jost, the United States Census Bureau's associate director for communications, said of the low black response rate in New York City. ''It's way too early to try and diagnose.''</p>
        <p>But inside Tract 414, there was little mystery about the low response there. Resident after resident, from pastors to postal workers, described a deep sense of mistrust and suspicion of the government, even among those employed in the public sector.</p>
        <p>The mistrust of the government drew no distinction between local, state and federal agencies, though residents say their suspicions have worsened in recent years because of several high-profile police brutality cases in New York City.</p>
        <p>''There's a combination of mistrust and the feeling that we're not going to get counted anyway,'' said the Rev. Samuel L. Zimmerman Jr., associate pastor of St. Paul Baptist Church of Jamaica on 171st Street, who has rented an apartment near the church since 1992.</p>
        <p>For many neighborhood residents, who are concerned about giving information to government agencies, all levels of government are ''clumped in the same basket,'' Mr. Zimmerman said, and the most visible arm of the government to the people of Tract 414, once a high-crime area, is the Police Department.</p>
        <p>''The fact that the Census Bureau has said that this information is confidential probably carries less credibility when they see other institutions that don't necessarily honor that,'' Mr. Zimmerman said during an interview in his one-room church, a converted house that has served as a church for 23 years. ''For example, the Police Department is to protect and serve, but there is some prominent evidence that it would seem to be otherwise.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zimmerman, who said he mailed in his census form immediately because he believes the neighborhood needs federal aid that is doled out based on population figures, read announcements from the Census Bureau during church services every Sunday in April, as did other neighborhood clerics, urging residents to fill out and return the forms. But Mr. Zimmerman said the response from his 45-member congregation was, at best, lukewarm, and, more often, dismissive.</p>
        <p>But the reluctance to send in questionnaires has not stopped many residents of the neighborhood from taking advantage of job opportunities with the Census Bureau, and several said they had applied for jobs doing door-to-door surveying. The jobs, which require passing an exam, pay $18.50 per hour in New York City.</p>
        <p>Census workers, living both inside and outside the neighborhood, said they were encountering much resistance in Tract 414.</p>
        <p>''They don't believe that the census is being taken for the good of the community,'' said Joyce Sweeting, a census taker working in Tract 414 and a resident of another neighborhood of Jamaica, who began knocking on doors on April 26. ''I'm having trouble. They believe it's just a sly way for the government to get into their business.''</p>
        <p>A census taker eventually persuaded Mrs. Gillespie to fill out a two-page questionnaire -- the long form she had received in the mail was sent to one-sixth of the nation's  households -- but it was a hard sell.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gillespie, 59, and several of her neighbors said their unwillingness to respond stemmed from the feeling that the people of the neighborhood had lifted themselves to middle-class status. (The median income in Tract 414 has risen gradually since 1990 to $45,000.) And the residents had turned around the area from a place that was literally tumbling down after the crack epidemic of the 1980's. When they needed help, they said, the government gave them none. So it is now difficult to see the point of getting counted to receive government assistance, they said.</p>
        <p>''Slowly, this place is coming along,'' said Mrs. Gillespie, who moved to 171st Street with her husband, James, a supervisor with the city's Department of Transportation, 11 years ago from a nearby section of Jamaica. ''But my thing is that in 11 years in other neighborhoods, it would have all been done by now. In better neighborhoods. If you want to put it bluntly, in white neighborhoods.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gillespie said that her block, 171st Street, between 107th and 108th Avenues, was ''torn up with potholes,'' when she moved there, and that the street remained so bad that no one could drive down it for another five years. She said that she and her neighbors got no action after making dozens of calls to city officials and politicians.</p>
        <p>Finally, Mrs. Gillespie said, a friend of hers who also worked for the Transportation Department called someone she knew in the Giuliani administration, and the street was paved within a few weeks.</p>
        <p>''We spent years just to get a decent street to park our cars and have people on the street,'' Mrs. Gillespie said. ''Most of the people here have put down their own sidewalks. They didn't put down a sidewalk for us. We have what the people put down, but we don't have one from the city.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zimmerman and others, noting the strong response to Census 2000 in places like Detroit, where Mayor Dennis Archer began an all-hands effort to get that city's population of 970,000 over the 1 million mark, said another cause of the low black response in New York may be a lack of effort on the city's part to get the word out to the black community.</p>
        <p>Comparing the census to voting, which has historically drawn low turnout from black constituents, Randolph Scott-McLaughlin, director of the Social Justice Center at Pace University's law school, said, ''We haven't got the habit yet, and it works against our own interest.</p>
        <p>''There is a cycle of distrust at work here, but also maybe you have to help people out,'' said Professor Scott-McLaughlin, a resident of Jamaica Estates, north of Tract 414. ''It seems like other cities did something about it, and now we're going to say there's an undercount again. Surprise, surprise, that's like saying there's gambling at Rick's,'' he said, referring to the scene of most of the action in the movie ''Casablanca.''</p>
        <p>City officials said that while they had not seen a racial breakdown of the census response, they had talked to elected officials and others from neighborhoods with historically low response rates and concluded that not much had changed since 1990. The overall 2000 census response rate for the city, 53 percent, was equal to the 1990 response.</p>
        <p>''We went out with a full-press'' effort, said Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington, who oversaw what he described as a two-year effort costing the city several million dollars to persuade New Yorkers to respond to the census. This included, he said, an advertising campaign that put 8,000 posters on subways, buses and garbage trucks and notices in residents' utility bills.</p>
        <p>''But you know we are faced with a problem, and this is from California to New York,'' Mr. Washington said. ''Why is it that within the African-American community people are suspect of these forms? There's a systemic problem, and I don't know what the answer may be.''</p>
        <p>Some residents of Tract 414, like James Terrell, 35, who now owns the house he grew up in on 171st Street, a few doors from Mrs. Gillespie, gave another reason for suspicions about the forms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Terrell said that he and several of his neighbors were afraid that giving too much information to the government, like a Social Security number or details about their jobs, would somehow jeopardize their newfound economic security, some of it pieced together with earnings from second and third jobs that are off the books.</p>
        <p>''In a lot of poor neighborhoods, people don't have anything to lose,'' said Mr. Terrell, who works at a nearby auto shop and also installs car stereos on the side. ''But here, I figure you have more to lose. I think that a lot of black people don't trust the American government. They feel that if I tell them all about myself, then all I'm doing is digging a bigger hole for myself. Maybe some people feel like they're getting away with something, let's just say. And this is the first time they've really had money to get out of a jam, you know.''</p>
        <p>As he was leaving for work, Mr. Terrell added, ''People finally have something now, and they don't want to lose it.''</p>
