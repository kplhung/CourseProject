        <p>A 2-year-old Queens boy who was found unconscious in a swimming pool yesterday was resuscitated in the back of a police van by an officer as his partners drove to the hospital, the police said.</p>
        <p>The authorities credited Officer John Cutrone with reviving the child, Anthony Dellavecchia, of 22-11 74th Street in Jackson Heights, after the boy's mother called 911 at 12:49 p.m.</p>
        <p>The boy, who was not breathing and had no pulse when the police arrived, was in critical condition last night at Elmhurst Hospital Center. The police said he remained unconscious and his prognosis was unclear.</p>
        <p>''The doctors said the next 72 hours is the critical point,'' said Lt. Patrick Wing, a shift commander at the 114th Precinct station house. ''That's when they will be able to determine what the extent of the injuries are.''</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Wing said the child fell into the pool while his mother, Patricia Dellavecchia, was inside feeding his 4-month-old sister. Ms. Dellavecchia thought the boy was playing in the basement, he said, but he child had apparently found his way into the yard and then scaled a fence around the pool.</p>
        <p>''What the family members did say is that the son is a notorious climber,'' Lieutenant Wing said. ''He climbs everything.''</p>
        <p>When Officer Cutrone and three other police officers arrived in a department van, Ms. Dellavecchia was standing at the end of the driveway, holding her son, who was turning blue. ''She was frantic,'' Officer Cutrone said.</p>
        <p>Officer Cutrone, 32, who said he has a newborn son and recently completed an infant cardiopulmonary resuscitation class, took the child and cleared his airway with a Heimlich maneuver as the van went to the hospital.</p>
        <p>Traveling a route the Police Department had cleared of traffic, the van arrived at the emergency room within two minutes, the police said. Along the way, Officer Cutrone said, the child began to breathe with his assistance and continually coughed up water. The boy's heartbeat was restored in the emergency room.</p>
        <p>Police officials said that the accident remained under investigation last night and that the authorities did not expect to file charges.</p>
