        <p>A new set of dancers in some of the principal roles helped add to the merriment of American Ballet Theater's production of ''Don Quixote'' on Saturday night at the Metropolitan Opera House.</p>
        <p>Julio Bocca once again portrayed Basilio, the work's romantic hero. But on this occasion Nina Ananiashvili was Basilio's beloved Kitri. They made a delightful couple.</p>
        <p>In the scenes in the city square and the inn, Ms. Ananiashvili danced sharply, but never harshly. Her leaps were jumps of joy and her pirouettes were brilliant. She retained this ease in the vision scene, but the way she made her movements seem carefully sculptured in the air indicated that she now represented an ideal image of love.</p>
        <p>Her sense of abandon and daring returned during the wedding pas de deux. Mr. Bocca, who had been playful throughout the production, now became grand, soaring effortlessly and lifting Ms. Ananiashvili triumphantly.</p>
        <p>As the ballet's other leading couple, Carmen Corella was confident as Mercedes, a street dancer, and Marcelo Gomes made Espada a proud matador who avoided looking merely haughty. Carlos Molina turned Gamache, Kitri's rich but ridiculous suitor, into a vain fop. And Oksana Konobeyeva skimmed daintily as Amour.</p>
        <p>Some of the group scenes lacked focus and suggested that someone from the company's staff should rehearse them scrupulously so that their dramatic and comic points are made clearly and without unnecessary fuss. Ermanno Florio conducted.</p>
