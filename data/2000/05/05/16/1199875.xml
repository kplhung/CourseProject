      <block class="full_text">
        <p>To golf fans angered by CBS Sports' abrupt departure from the Byron Nelson Classic on Sunday before Jesper Parnevik won on the third sudden-death hole, add one more dissenting voice: the PGA Tour.</p>
        <p>By leaving the playoff at 6:38 p.m. Eastern, CBS violated its contract with the tour, which requires it to stick with coverage until at least 7 p.m.</p>
        <p>In a statement released yesterday, the PGA Tour pronounced itself ''deeply disappointed'' with CBS. The Tour added that the network had made assurances ''that an occurrence such as yesterday's, which has never before happened with a CBS telecast of a PGA Tour event, will not be repeated.''</p>
        <p>CBS's decision to withdraw before Parnevik and Davis Love III teed off on the third playoff hole was not a golf decision. It was all about entertainment, and the sanctity of the night's prime-time schedule: ''60 Minutes,'' followed by ''Touched by an Angel,'' and Part 1 of ''Jesus.''</p>
        <p>At no time was the golf tournament -- a nonmajor, no less -- to delay for a nanosecond the start of prime-time during a crucial sweeps month.</p>
        <p>'' 'Jesus' was on the cover of virtually everybody's TV book and we didn't want to push back prime-time,'' LeslieAnne Wade, a spokeswoman for CBS Sports, said.</p>
        <p>As the tournament passed its expected 6 p.m. conclusion, CBS made a rough calculation that the third sudden-death playoff hole would not end until at least 7:02, with no guarantee that it would be the last. So CBS chose to bail out at 6:38, after the second hole, rather than show Parnevik and Love at the 18th.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, CBS's calculation was wrong: Parnevik won at the third playoff hole, at 6:58 p.m.</p>
        <p>''Nobody feels good about this,'' Wade said. ''These are split-second decisions done with inexact math.''</p>
        <p>Had Tiger Woods been playing Love, CBS might have hung around to show Woods hit his tee shot on the third playoff hole.</p>
        <p>''Tiger would have added another component, but we would have done the same thing,'' Wade said.</p>
        <p>The reflexive thought is that CBS would not dare pre-empt Woods if he was in a position to win. But on this Sunday, even Tiger -- said to have messianic qualities by his father -- would have found it hard to compete with ''Jesus'' in CBS's eye.</p>
        <p>From 9 to 10 p.m. ''Jesus'' battled ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' Between 9 and 9:30, ''Jesus'' won, with a 14.9 Nielsen rating to ''Millionaire's'' 13.3. But from 9:30 to 10, Regis struck back, winning, 15.6-15.2.</p>
        <p>The Byron Nelson, incidentally, generated a 4.0 overnight rating.</p>
        <p>And CBS will never cut away from golf again before 7 o'clock.</p>
        <p>Until ''Jesus II: The Return.''</p>

        <p>Richard Hall's game but losing performance against Roy Jones Jr. Saturday night produced three unexpected fans for the light-heavyweight challenger: HBO's announcers.</p>
        <p>Jim Lampley, George Foreman and Larry Merchant declared that Hall was overmatched -- that was obvious, especially in two rounds when Hall landed only two punches -- but they admired his courage.</p>
        <p>''I'll tell you what,'' Lampley said in the seventh round. ''Richard Hall has guts.'' Later, in the ninth round, Lampley added, ''I'm embarrassed when I said three weeks ago this would be an egregious mismatch.''</p>
        <p>In the sixth, Merchant: ''He's one brave dude, Richard Hall.''</p>
        <p>By the ninth round, the announcers started lobbying for the referee Wayne Kelly to stop the punishment.</p>
        <p>''This is absurd!'' Lampley cried with 1 minute 54 seconds left in the 11th. ''Stop the fight. Stop it, Wayne. Come on. This isn't competitive anymore. It's a bloodletting.'' After Kelly declared a technical knockout, Merchant added, ''The referee ought to be pistol-whipped for allowing that to go on.''</p>
        <p>An excessive punishment, but Merchant would not have said it if Jones did not insist on fighting mandatory challengers whom talent bypassed. Last year, he dispatched an embarrassing mandatory, Richard Frazier, the World Boxing Council's No. 1 contender, in the second round. Hall was the World Boxing Association's top contender. And Jones is looking to face the International Boxing Federation's highest-ranked challenger, to be chosen from the winner of the little-anticipated Antonio Tarver-Eric Harding bout.</p>
        <p>But Jones does not want to lose any of his belts and HBO cannot force him to surrender a belt.</p>
        <p>''It's maddening,'' said Seth Abraham, the president of Time Warner Sports. ''For Roy, the belts represent a level of status that we don't hear from Lennox Lewis, Oscar De La Hoya and Naseem Hamed.''</p>
        <p>Technically, HBO could pay Jones his millions and not televise a gross mismatch, Abraham said, ''but if we didn't, we'd open ourselves up to a breach of contract lawsuit.''</p>
        <p>Only one fight remains on Jones's HBO contract. The fight must be on TVKO pay-per-view, for which Jones is guaranteed no money. And he will face Tarver or Harding, unless he wants to lose his I.B.F. belt.</p>
        <p>''Roy will earn whatever the public thinks that fight is worth,'' Abraham said. Which won't be much. Jones's pay-per-view appeal has been compromised by the weak light-heavyweight division. Even Jones's talent can't make up for a mismatch when fans are asked to pay $40 or $50. His appeal would increase if he moves into the heavyweight division, if only for the novelty, even if the opponent is a small heavyweight like Chris Byrd. A title fight against Lewis could be a blockbuster.</p>
        <p>Airwaves</p>
        <p>The four National Basketball Association playoff games Saturday and Sunday on NBC produced an average 5.8 overnight Nielsen rating, down 13 percent from a 6.7 for two weekend games on the comparable weekend in 1999.</p>
