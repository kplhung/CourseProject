        <p>THE REFORM PARTY</p>
        <p>SPARKS OVER THE BALLOT IN TEXAS -- When Patrick J. Buchanan presented Texas election officials last week with twice the number of signatures required to have his name placed on the state ballot in November, some leaders of the Reform Party thought they detected a giant sucking sound, to use a favorite phrase of the party's founder, Ross Perot. Mr. Buchanan is seeking the presidential nomination of the Reform Party, but in gathering the signatures, he listed himself as an independent. Mr. Buchanan said he went the independent route in Texas because he wanted to use paid petition circulators to assure that he would get the requisite 58,000 signatures. But party officials said Mr. Buchanan's paid effort so undercut its volunteers that the party, and its numerous federal, state and local candidates, may not get on the November ballot.</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>CANDIDATES LOOKING TO MC CAIN -- Senator John McCain has agreed to campaign for Republican candidates in at least 35 House races, and McCain aides report that he is considering requests from at least 35 other candidates. Party leaders say Mr. McCain is in such demand because he not only draws Republicans but also lures many independents and significant numbers of wavering Democrats. During the primary season, that combination was the key to his victories in New Hampshire and Michigan and his strong performances in several other states. So what might happen if Mr. McCain made an appearance with a Democrat -- one in tune with him on his favorite issue, campaign finance reform? Might he help lure over some independents and wavering Republicans? Such questions apparently came to mind when State Representative Elaine Bloom, a Florida Democrat seeking to unseat Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., a Republican, heard that Mr. McCain was to campaign for Mr. Shaw. She invited him to join her for a news conference on campaign finance reform. He did not.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>TEXAS LAWYERS LOOK TO DEMOCRATIC PARTY -- The Democratic Party has received large contributions this year from trial lawyers in Texas who were awarded sizable legal fees for successfully representing the state in a $17.3 billion tobacco lawsuit. So far, the lawyers have collected $400 million of the $3.3 billion in fees that the court had authorized. Apparently feeling flush, they are giving away millions to help Democratic candidates. The Dallas Morning News reported on Sunday that since January, lawyers in five firms involved in the tobacco suit have contributed nearly $2 million in unrestricted ''soft money'' to the Democratic Party. The newspaper said the top Texas donor was the Houston law firm of John Eddie Williams, which contributed $720,000. Other big givers included the Beaumont firm of Walter Umphrey, $350,000; Harold Nix of Daingerfield, $420,000; Wayne A. Reaud of Beaumont, $250,000; and John M. O'Quinn of Houston, $100,000.</p>

        <p>AL GORE, THE CARTOON -- Vice President Al Gore's aides may have finally found a way to overcome complaints about his being too stiff: animation. In the May 21 season finale of the Fox sci-fi comedy, ''Futurama,'' the real Mr. Gore provides the voice for a cartoon Al Gore in an episode titled, ''Back to the Present.'' In the show, the cartoon Mr. Gore leads a team of ''Action Rangers'' who help the bumbling Futurama regular, Fry, return to the 31st Century after he gets stranded in the 21st.</p>

        <p>AL GORE, THE FATHER AND SON -- After wrapping up a campaign speech yesterday afternoon near Philadelphia, Vice President Al Gore flew on a half-empty Air Force II to Nashville, to pick up his mother, Pauline. The two were scheduled to fly to New York City today to see Mr. Gore's daughter, Karenna, graduate from Columbia Law School. Mr. Gore's aides said the flight to Nashville was paid for by taxpayers instead of by his campaign because it involved family business.</p>
