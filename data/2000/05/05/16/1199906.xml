        <p>E*Trade said it would form an alliance with Wit Capital after that online investment bank acquires E*Offering, a rival that E*Trade helped to finance a year ago. Wit Capital plans to issue stock worth $328 million to the shareholders of E*Offering. [Page C2.]</p>

        <p>AOL Agrees to Settle S.E.C. Case  America Online agreed to pay a fine of $3.5 million and to restate its books from 1995 and 1996 after the Securities and Exchange Commission charged that the company had improperly inflated profits by hundreds of millions of dollars. For America Online, which stopped using the disputed accounting method in 1996, the settlement is probably of minimal import now. But it could have an effect on other companies in young and rapidly changing industries because the commission's position will force them to deduct all promotional expenses from earnings immediately. Shares of AOL rose $3.125, to $58.50. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Unilever Pressures Bestfoods  Stepping up the pressure on a reluctant takeover target, the co-chairman of Unilever said that he thought the $18.4 billion offer made this month for Bestfoods was ''serious money'' and that the company wants Bestfoods' executives to meet with Unilever to discuss it.
