        <p>Harold O. Levy, the interim schools chancellor, quietly visited City Hall yesterday to ask Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to support his bid for the permanent chancellor post.</p>
        <p>It was only the second time that Mr. Levy has succeeded in meeting with Mr. Giuliani, who fought his appointment in January, saying he was too close to the teachers union. But while the mayor was expressing doubts about Mr. Levy's performance as recently as two weeks ago, his aides characterized yesterday's meeting as ''productive'' and ''valuable.''</p>
        <p>''It was a good meeting and a valuable exchange of ideas,'' said Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles. ''They decided it would be valuable to hold future meetings on a regular basis, to talk about ways of bringing change to the public schools.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani will announce today whether or not he will direct his two appointees to the Board of Education to vote for Mr. Levy, the aides said. But the mayor's support is not essential, because four of the Board of Education's seven members have already promised to vote for Mr. Levy.</p>
        <p>The vote is scheduled for Wednesday. The board announced two weeks ago that six other candidates were competing with Mr. Levy for the job. But by late last week, all of those candidates had dropped out.</p>
        <p>Karen Crowe, a spokeswoman for Mr. Levy, described his meeting with the mayor as ''friendly and cordial.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Coles said that Mr. Levy had requested the meeting last week, because ''he wanted to discuss with the mayor the things he believes he has accomplished and the direction he wants to go in.'' Among other subjects, the two men discussed the issue of merit pay for teachers -- which Mr. Giuliani strongly supports but Mr. Levy has expressed qualms about.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coles said the men also discussed strategies for turning around failing schools, and the contentious issue of school choice. Mr. Giuliani has proposed a voucher program that would use public funds to send a limited number of children to private school. Mr. Levy has not publicly stated his position on that proposal.</p>
        <p>''There were a number of issues the mayor and chancellor agreed on, a number they did not,'' Mr. Coles said. ''But it was a productive and valuable meeting.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Coles sat in on the meeting, along with Deputy Mayor Joseph J. Lhota and Ninfa Segarra, a former deputy mayor who is one of Mr. Giuliani's appointees to the board.</p>
