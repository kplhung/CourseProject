        <p>SFX, the entertainment and sport marketing company, expanded its collection of prominent sports agencies by acquiring Sports Management Group, whose clients include Jerry Rice, Mike Alstott and Elvis Grbac.</p>
        <p>Sports Management, owned by Jim Steiner, will be folded into the SFX Sports Group, whose chairman is David Falk. Steiner will run SFX Football.</p>
        <p>In 1998, SFX bought Falk's agency, F.A.M.E. Since then, it has purchased Hendricks Management and Speakers of Sport, which are primarily baseball agencies, and Tellem &amp; Associates, which has basketball and baseball clients.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, SFX also acquired Black Canyon Productions, the renowned sports documentary producer, which has won three Peabody Awards and three Sports Emmy Awards. Its films for HBO Sports include When It Was A Game, Fists of Freedom, Babe Ruth, and City Dump.</p>
        <p>In February, SFX agreed to be acquired by Clear Channel Communications for $3.3 billion in stock and the assumption of $1.1 billion in debt. The transaction is expected to close later this year.</p>
