        <p>Turning Point</p>
        <p>The established masters bore names like Beaux, Burne-Jones, Degas and Monet. The upstarts were Kandinsky, Matisse, Mondrian and Picasso. They met at the intersection that was 1900, and the contrast between 19th-century academic tradition and the emerging avant-garde will be examined starting on Friday in a new exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street. With 240 works by 170 artists and a dozen themes, among them nudes and bathers, portraits and landscapes, ''1900: Art at the Crossroads'' continues through Sept. 10.</p>
        <p>New Hear This</p>
        <p>What's new today? The Baisley Powell Elebash Recital Hall at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York in the center's new home in the former B. Altman building on Fifth Avenue at 34th Street. The 185-seat auditorium will be used for concerts by faculty and students as well as a musical program series. Much of the programming at the hall, endowed by the estate of Mr. Elebash, a native New Yorker and World War I Navy veteran, will be devoted to music reflecting the city's ethnic diversity.</p>
        <p>Sight and Sound</p>
        <p>Even if you have never seen an unidentified flying object, you can hear one this week in the middle of Lincoln Center. ''UFO,'' Michael Daugherty's piece for solo percussion and orchestra, will receive its New York premiere at 6:45 p.m. tomorrow in a New York Philharmonic concert at Avery Fisher Hall. The three-movement work, inspired by the nation's obsession with unidentified flying objects, was commissioned for the percussionist Evelyn Glennie and the conductor Leonard Slatkin, both of whom are to appear with the Philharmonic. The piece is to be repeated at five other concerts Thursday to Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Curtain Calls</p>
        <p>Among highlights of New York's warm-weather season are the Museum Mile Festival on Fifth Avenue and the free Met in the Parks operas. This year the festival and the opening performance of the Met series are on June 13. The 22nd annual Museum Mile Festival, offering free visits to nine cultural institutions on a traffic-free stretch from 82nd Street to 104th Street, takes place from 6 to 9 p.m. And the three-week Met Opera series of two operas in six performances each in parks in the five boroughs, New Jersey and, for the first time, New Haven, begins on the Great Lawn in Central Park at 8 p.m. with Verdi's ''Rigoletto.'' The season's second attraction is Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly,'' which opens in Cunningham Park in Fresh Meadows, Queens, on June 14 and will be heard on the Great Lawn on June 20.</p>
