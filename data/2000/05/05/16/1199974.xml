        <p>Mr. Gore's lackluster personal favorability ratings may help explain why Mr. Bush has emerged at this early stage as the preferred candidate across the demographic spectrum, including three critical groups that voted Democratic in 1996: Catholics, independents and Northeasterners.

        <p>While many Americans find Vice President Al Gore's stands on issues more appealing, he is not as well liked or considered as commanding a leader as Gov. George W. Bush, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's lackluster personal favorability ratings may help explain why Mr. Bush has emerged at this early stage as the preferred candidate across the demographic spectrum, including three critical groups that voted Democratic in 1996: Catholics, independents and Northeasterners. Voters polled, in fact, are so lukewarm toward Mr. Gore that he is widely perceived as a loser in November: by a ratio of nearly 2 to 1, they expect Mr. Bush to capture the White House.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Bush's advantages six months before Election Day, Mr. Gore may be heartened that vice presidents are often overshadowed by the presidents they serve until they can distinguish themselves on a national stage at their nominating convention. In fact, at this time 12 years ago, Mr. Bush's father, then the vice president, trailed Michael S. Dukakis by 10 points, but went on to a lopsided victory in November.</p>
        <p>And the survey illuminated potential rough patches for the Texas governor. For one thing, voters polled had qualms with his plan, which he outlined yesterday, that would allow workers to invest part of their payroll taxes in private accounts. Most of those polled said the stock market was a perilous place to invest.</p>
        <p>Voters also seemed skeptical of Mr. Bush's proposed tax cut of $483 billion over five years -- a measure that Mr. Gore has condemned as a ''risky tax scheme.'' Even 57 percent of people who said they planned to vote for Mr. Bush were uncertain of the effect of that proposal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush will also have to cautiously navigate roiling factions in his own ranks. Three of every 10 Republican voters polled said that if the governor picks a running mate who supports legalized abortion they would be less likely to support him. About a third of all voters said religious conservatives carry too much influence in the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>The nationwide telephone survey was conducted last Wednesday through Saturday with 947 adults, including 716 registered voters. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 to 4 percentage points.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most promising news for Mr. Gore was that he scored well with voters on issues they said were at the top of their agenda, like health care, education and Social Security. He was also seen as more caring than Mr. Bush, despite the governor's slogan that he is a ''compassionate conservative.''</p>
        <p>Given that his issues are popular and that the economy seems hearty, the nagging difficulty that has confounded the vice president's advisers and many Democrats is why his overall ratings are not more competitive with Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Among all voters, Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore by 8 percentage points, 47 to 39. Mr. Bush held a wide advantage among men, 50 to 36 percentage points; among women, Mr. Gore drew 42 percent, Mr. Bush, 44 percent.</p>
        <p>The vice president's lagging ratings appear to have more to do with personality than policy. Mr. Gore was seen favorably by 34 percent of registered voters and unfavorably by 36 percent. By contrast, Mr. Bush was seen favorably by 40 percent and unfavorably by 28 percent.</p>
        <p>A related problem that has dogged Mr. Gore is that Mr. Bush is viewed as more of a leader. Fifty-three percent of registered voters in the new poll said Mr. Gore had strong leadership qualities; 63 percent said the same thing about Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>The contrast is striking, particularly since Mr. Gore has been an elected official since 1976, when he was elected to the House from Tennessee; Mr. Bush was elected governor, his first office, in 1994. That said, Mr. Gore has spent the past seven years in the shadow of a president who consistently draws high ratings for the job he has done in office.</p>
        <p>Several people who responded to the poll explained in follow-up interviews that there were not specific issues on which they split sharply with Mr. Gore. Rather, they often cited more intangible personal factors.</p>
        <p>''Gore has not really shown a lot of leadership qualities or abilities to be in a position to run our nation,'' said Ken Bogler, 27, a labor representative from Somerset, N.J., who is an independent. ''It's a presence, really. The way he carries himself, the way he speaks, does not seem presidential.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''Issues don't play a big part in my support. Nine times out of 10, the candidates change their positions once they get into office any way. He may have the experience, but if you don't have the confidence and the abilities of someone who can handle the job, you don't give him the job.''</p>
        <p>Vera Jeane, 71, a retired nurse from Bay City, Tex., who is a Democrat, put it this way: ''Al Gore acts as if he's not sure what he's thinking, as if he doesn't have a mind of his own. He doesn't seem to be strong enough in his opinions and as a leader to be president. Bush seems to be a stronger man with more definitive opinions. And I think he would make a better leader.''</p>
        <p>Tony Coelho, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, said he was not discouraged by such critiques and insisted that voters would defect from Mr. Bush when his policy stands are articulated in detail.</p>
        <p>''You take the issues that are out there today,'' he said. ''As we get to the general election, we're going to be forcing a debate.''</p>
        <p>Citing how Mr. Gore has inched up in the polls since last year, Mr. Coelho added: ''We've made up a lot of points with George Bush. I'm not worried about George Bush at this point.''</p>
        <p>With fewer than 3 in 10 voters saying they were paying a lot of attention to the campaign, the candidates have not yet been able to fully define themselves to the electorate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, in particular, has made little headway in trumpeting his programs for cutting taxes and overhauling the Social Security system. Only 9 percent of registered voters in the poll said they knew a great deal about Mr. Bush's tax blueprint; 58 percent said they had no idea whether his plan would help or hurt the economy.</p>
        <p>By a ratio of 4 to 1, those polled preferred using any budget surplus to shore up Social Security rather than to cut income taxes -- even as a majority said it might be possible to do both.</p>
        <p>In a finding that raises questions about the Social Security proposal Mr. Bush discussed yesterday, those polled were closely divided over whether individuals should be allowed to invest portions of their Social Security taxes on their own.</p>
        <p>When asked to put aside their presidential preferences and focus on issues, Mr. Gore was considered more capable in tackling Social Security and education, traditional Democratic strengths.</p>
        <p>But the candidates were viewed about evenly in handling gun control, which has long been viewed as a Democratic issue, and taxes.</p>
        <p>Voters also identified stark ideological differences between the candidates. For all the efforts by Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore to court moderates, voters did not see them as moderates.</p>
        <p>Forty-three percent of registered voters said they thought of Mr. Bush as a conservative while 34 percent said they thought he was a moderate. Similarly, 43 percent cast Mr. Gore as a liberal, while 30 percent said he was more a moderate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has been unable to shake the idea advanced by gun control advocates that the National Rifle Association would wield considerable influence in a Bush administration. Voters were three times more likely to say that Mr. Bush would be influenced greatly by the N.R.A. than Mr. Gore would.</p>
        <p>In the follow-up interviews, some voters, citing character considerations, lamented that Senator John McCain, who was defeated by Mr. Bush in the Republican primaries, would not be on any ticket. In fact, Mr. McCain has maintained far more impressive favorability ratings than Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore: 46 percent have a favorable view of him; 14 percent hold an unfavorable view.</p>
        <p>''I don't see in Gore or Bush that clear definitive leadership quality that McCain had,'' said Tim Olkar, 22, a student in Wheaton, Ill., who is an independent.</p>
        <p>Speaking of Mr. Gore, he said: ''He seems kind of wishy-washy as a candidate and seems to be running a negative campaign. Bush seems a little more genuine to me.''</p>
        <p>Beyond the candidates themselves, the Democratic and Republican parties are now seen more favorably than less so by voters. The Republican Party, in particular, has rebounded to its standing before the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, which took a toll on the party.</p>
        <p>There was no upswing for the Reform Party, which seems poised to nominate Patrick J. Buchanan as its standard bearer. The party is seen twice as negatively as positively.</p>
        <p>''How the Poll Was Conducted''</p>
        <p>The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Wednesday through Saturday with 947 adults throughout the United States. Of these, 716 said they were registered to vote.</p>
        <p>The telephone exchanges called were randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges in the United States.</p>
        <p>Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.</p>
        <p>The results have been weighted to account for household size and the number of telephone lines in the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.</p>
        <p>In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than four percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by talking to all registered voter in the United States.</p>
        <p>For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger.</p>
        <p>In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error. Variations in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.</p>
