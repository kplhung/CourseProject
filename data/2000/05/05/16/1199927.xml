        <p>The 13 people who were killed by two students at Columbine High School last year were shot within the first 16 minutes of the siege as the authorities were still assessing the situation, according to a report issued today by the Jefferson County Sheriff. But it was more than 40 minutes after the shooting began that the police entered the building, and hours before some victims were found or rescued.</p>
        <p>As the first detailed account of the shootings, the report offers a timeline on what happened at the school on April 20, 1999, when two students carried out a carefully planned attack that they hoped would kill hundreds of students and staff members with guns and homemade bombs. Most of the bombs did not go off, but the two gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, shot to death 12 students and a teacher and wounded 23 other students before killing themselves.</p>
        <p>Despite the size of the report -- a CD-ROM that includes text, photographs, sound recordings and video from surveillance cameras -- the presentation leaves unanswered many fundamental questions about what drove the two teenagers to one of the worst mass shootings in modern America. Nor did it try to interpret motives from videotapes the teenagers made a month before the killings in which they expressed hatred and showed off their formidable arsenal of weapons.</p>
        <p>Rather, as Steve Davis, a spokesman for Sheriff John P. Stone, said today, the purpose of the report was only to reconstruct the movements of the killers, their victims and the authorities on the scene. The report made no judgments about the authorities' actions, which has become a major issue for many families of victims who feel that officers did not act fast enough to save lives.</p>
        <p>The report, which the authorities said was based on 4,500 interviews and more than 10,000 pieces of evidence, included no major revelations. At the same time, however, it dispelled several rumors, including the possibility of a third gunman or that anyone at the school had been accidentally shot by the police.</p>
        <p>But the report also reveals how perplexed and uncertain the law enforcement officers were in responding, especially in the early minutes, when conflicting information relayed through a barrage of 911 calls left them unsure what they were encountering. For example, early reports  said a shooter was on the roof of the school, which was not the case. The person on the roof was an air conditioning repairman, the report said.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem, as the report reflected, was the number of agencies responding -- city, county and state -- with little coordination.</p>
        <p>''They let the killers take over our school,'' said Judy Brown, the mother of a Columbine student, expressing anger and frustration over the police response. ''They stood outside. They let this happen. They let it continue. They should've gone in.''</p>
        <p>The backbone of the report is the chronology, starting with the times Mr. Harris and Mr. Klebold, wearing long black coats to conceal their weapons, arrived at school and, just before 11:17 a.m., planted two duffel bags in the cafeteria, each containing ''enough explosive power to kill the majority of students who soon would be arriving'' for lunch. Afterward, they returned to their cars, which were also rigged with bombs, to await the explosions.</p>
        <p>The authorities found that ''blending in with 400 other backpacks and bags scattered throughout the cafeteria,'' made the duffel bags virtually indistinguishable.</p>
        <p>Neither those bombs nor ones in the cars ever went off. But another, planned as a diversion, did explode in a nearby field, prompting the first emergency call at 11:19.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Harris and Mr. Klebold, standing at the school's west steps, made their move, the report said. One of them said, ''Go, go,'' and they pulled out shotguns and began shooting, killing Rachel Scott and injuring Richard Castaldo, who had been sitting on the grass together. Within seconds, at least eight more students were shot, including Daniel Rohrbough, who died. According to the report, a witness heard one of the gunmen shout: ''This is what we always wanted to do. This is awesome.''</p>
        <p>It would still be four more minutes, at 11:23, before the first law enforcement officer, Sheriff's Deputy Neil Gardner, arrived at the school, where calm had turned to chaos inside with loud explosions, smoke and students cowering in fear. Mr. Harris spotted the deputy and the two exchanged fire before Mr. Harris retreated inside the school.</p>
        <p>Over the next four minutes, the gunmen walked down hallways, ''firing weapons,'' the report said, adding ''both are laughing.'' Another student and a teacher, Dave Sanders, were shot in a hallway.</p>
        <p>The gunmen continued shooting at random targets, the report said, and tossing bombs as they walked toward the library, where they shot and killed another 10 people.</p>
        <p>To this point, they had been inside the school only seven and a half minutes, while, outside, officers were scrambling to assess the situation. According to the chronology, even after Mr. Harris and Mr. Klebold had killed all but themselves, the authorities were only beginning to amass -- to nearly 1,000 by later in the day -- and none had entered the school.</p>
        <p>The final moments of carnage were almost surreal, as the report described them, based on interviews, surveillance tapes and other forensic evidence. By then, many students had escaped from the school. The gunmen left the library, making their way toward the science area, shooting randomly and tossing bombs, some of which exploded. The report said, ''Their behavior now seems directionless.''</p>
        <p>They returned to the cafeteria, where some students were still hiding. Mr. Harris shot several times into the duffel bag left earlier, but the bomb did not detonate. Then, the report said, ''The suspects both take a moment to drink from water bottles left by students on the school  lunch tables.'' A witness later told the authorities that one of them said: ''Today, the world's going to come to an end. Today's the day we die.'' It was 11:44.</p>
        <p>Over the next 24 minutes, as the authorities were still grappling with the magnitude of events and beginning to get medical attention to those shot outside the school, the killers roamed inside with no apparent purpose, finally returning to the library, where Deputy Kevin Walker ''sees a muzzle flash'' from a window.</p>
        <p>That flash, the authorities determined, was the gunfire the killers turned on themselves. By then, they had fired 188 shots.</p>
        <p>The officers fired 141 times, mainly in exchanges before the gunmen entered the school and as the boys leaned out windows of the building and fired at officers.</p>
        <p>It was not until 12:06, just after the suicides, that the first officers, a SWAT team of five, entered the building. But almost 25 minutes passed before a second team entered to assist them.</p>
        <p>By then, medical authorities had begun to reach some of the injured students, more people were evacuated and SWAT teams began a methodical search of the school. The authorities were still being warned of possible bombs in the school, but the building was gradually secured even though some injured students, including Pat Ireland, who climbed out of a second-floor window at 2:38, were not rescued until several hours after the shooting stopped. Rescuers did not reach Mr. Sanders, the teacher, until 2:42, when they found him gravely wounded. But medical personnel could not reach him, and he was pronounced dead more than two hours later. Meanwhile, the first  SWAT team did not reach the library until 3:22. Besides the dead, officers found at least two other students who were injured, as well as the teacher, Patti Nielson, who had made the first 911 call. Ms. Nielson was found hiding in a cupboard in a small room in the library.</p>
        <p>It will, no doubt, be left to the growing number of lawsuits to sort out other details about the siege. So far, 15 families have sued Jefferson County, alleging negligence by the sheriff's department for not intervening faster.</p>
        <p>Also, Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado  has appointed a special commission to investigate the incident, giving it a much wider mandate than Sheriff Stone had for his report, including the killers' motives.</p>
        <p>''Probably what we really want is not going to be in there,'' said Connie Michalik, whose son, Richard Castaldo, was injured by gunfire. ''What we really wanted was why they didn't do more to prevent it before it started.''</p>
        <p>Michael Shoeles, whose son Isaiah was killed, has been highly critical of the sheriff's department. He repeated his call for a federal investigation and said today from his home in Houston: ''The truth is not in that report. Bring people in here who did not botch the investigation.''</p>
