        <p>Since it was established in 1935, Social Security has had two fundamental principles. It has been a guaranteed government benefit. And it has been self-financed, paid for out of payroll taxes levied on workers and employers.</p>
        <p>In reopening the debate today over how best to maintain the solvency of the retirement system as the population ages, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush each challenged one of those principles.</p>
        <p>Taking one of the biggest political risks of the presidential campaign so far, Mr. Bush proposed allowing individual workers to invest a part of their payroll taxes through private accounts. His plan would give workers an opportunity to capture some of the riches that Wall Street creates, but would also leave those workers to suffer the financial consequences if their timing or judgment is off.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore wants to maintain the guaranteed nature of the Social Security benefit, allowing it to remain a bulwark against poverty in old age. But through a somewhat complicated mechanism, Mr. Gore is calling for the bill to be paid in part over the long run out of general tax revenues -- in effect, heaving the problem onto the shoulders of taxpayers three decades from now.</p>
        <p>Those differing approaches to dealing with the financial problems that threaten to afflict Social Security are at the heart of a longstanding ideological dispute about the relationship between government and individuals.</p>
        <p>Like most Democrats, Mr. Gore is comfortable with government as a guarantor and sees Social Security as a collective commitment that binds the generations. Like most Republicans, Mr. Bush is dedicated to giving more power and responsibility to individuals.</p>
        <p>A few years ago, President Clinton and the Republican leadership in Congress tried to find some common ground and failed.</p>
        <p>In elevating the call for private accounts to the presidential campaign, Mr. Bush is asking for a mandate to break the deadlock. Although Mr. Gore's approach would eventually require a fundamental change in  the nature of the system as well, the vice president has cast himself as the defender of a program that has proved to be perhaps the most popular and most effective of any administered in Washington.</p>
        <p>It is already clear that the clash between the two candidates will be supercharged, with Mr. Gore in particular unleashing a sustained attack on Mr. Bush's position. And the more heated the clash, the greater the risk that the debate will so polarize voters and unnerve politicians that it blocks progress for years.</p>
        <p>''It is a good issue to debate as long as the discussion remains civil,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who is now president of the Urban Institute, a research group. ''It could easily backfire and lead to a situation where the lesson coming out of this campaign is, 'Don't try and deal forthrightly with the American people on this issue when there isn't an immediate crisis.' ''</p>
        <p>Polls suggest that voters are split. In a survey conducted last week, The New York Times/CBS News Poll found that 51 percent thought allowing individuals to invest a part of their payroll taxes was a good idea, and 45 percent thought it was a bad one.</p>
        <p>Many Democrats and some Republicans wonder why Mr. Bush has chosen to wade into such a polarizing issue. ''Politically it's not'' a great idea, said Senator Judd Gregg, a Republican from New Hampshire who is one of the most prominent advocates of adding private accounts to Social Security.</p>
        <p>''But it's a genuine act of leadership,'' Senator Gregg said, ''because if he's successful, he will have broken the iron triangle of demagoguery -- Gore, Gephardt and the labor unions. And he'll have a national mandate to do something in this area.'' His reference was to Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader.</p>
        <p>But both sides also have electoral strategies in mind. For Republicans, putting Social Security on the front burner is an effort to attract what they see as an emerging investor class. More than 50 percent of households now invest in the market directly or indirectly. Many of them have had great success as Wall Street has boomed, and are presumed by Republicans to want greater control over their finances.</p>
        <p>Republicans also see private accounts as a way to grab the attention of young voters, who tend to believe that Social Security will not be around when they retire.</p>
        <p>Yet Democrats think that in the end the only groups that will be motivated to vote on the basis of the candidates' positions on Social Security will be the elderly and those workers nearing retirement. Those groups have consistently opposed any fundamental changes to Social Security.</p>
        <p>''The Bush campaign is betting that young people will end up voting on this issue,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. ''But recent history is pretty clear that the people who vote on Social Security tend to be in their 50's and older, and their vote is based on making sure that the system that's protecting their parents is there to protect them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is trying to turn attention to the trade-off at the core of Mr. Gore's plan, which is built around eliminating the $3.5 trillion in national debt held by the public and capturing the interest savings for Social Security.</p>
        <p>When all the complexities are stripped away, Mr. Gore's plan would leave the government in financially sound condition -- but would also transfer to future generations of taxpayers the burden of keeping Social Security solvent.</p>
        <p>''The Gore plan will eventually require a 25 percent increase in income taxes -- the largest in our history -- or a substantial reduction in benefits,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is trying to keep the debate focused on the risks inherent  in investing Social Security money in the financial markets -- and is emphasizing that Mr. Bush's plan would leave less money to pay down the debt. The Bush plan ''would weaken our national economy,'' Mr. Gore said, and create the risk of millions of retirees ''left without enough to make ends meet.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said one thing today that Mr. Bush would no doubt agree with.</p>
        <p>''There is a fundamental difference on this issue in this election,'' Mr. Gore said, ''which offers the country the most critical choice on Social Security since it was first enacted in 1935.''</p>
        <p>''BUSH AND GORE PROPOSALS''</p>
        <p>Different Approaches to Social Security</p>
        <p>Social Security faces a financial shortfall as the baby boom generation ages. Based on current estimates, the retirement system would spend its reserves by 2037, leaving it able to pay only 75 percent of promised benefits after that point. To deal with that problem, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush are proposing different solutions.</p>
        <p>THE GORE PLAN</p>
        <p>It is built around paying off the $3.5 trillion in national debt held by the public and using the savings that would have paid the interest on the debt to bolster Social Security.</p>
        <p>The vice president would use the portion of the projected federal budget surplus generated by excess Social Security payroll revenues -- or more than $2 trillion over the next decade -- to reduce the federal debt. His plan calculates that the debt could be paid by 2013.</p>
        <p>Starting in 2011, Mr. Gore would begin transferring to Social Security an amount equal to the interest saved through reduction of the public debt. The amount would start at around $100 billion a year, and would grow to more than $200 billion a year by 2015. By doing so, Mr. Gore's plan would extend Social Security's solvency to 2050 without any cuts in benefits.</p>
        <p>The money Mr. Gore would transfer into Social Security would not be cash, but instead i.o.u.'s that would have to be paid out of general tax revenues. In that way, Mr. Gore's plan would obligate taxpayers decades in the future to pay to keep the system afloat out of general revenues from income taxes -- a change from the current system under which Social Security is financed out of payroll taxes.</p>
        <p>THE BUSH PLAN</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's approach is built around the idea that the only alternative to cutting benefits or raising taxes is to increase the rate of return on the money going into the Social Security system. The best way to accomplish that goal, in his view, is to allow all workers to invest part of their payroll taxes in private accounts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has provided few details, saying that the specifics would have to be worked out in bipartisan negotiations. There are a variety of approaches to establishing individual investment accounts, and most would use about 2 percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax that goes to pay Social Security benefits.</p>
        <p>Any investment plan that used 2 percentage points of the payroll tax would use about $1 trillion of the Social Security surplus over the next decade. That money would otherwise go to debt reduction, so Mr. Bush's plan would leave the nation with a larger debt than Mr. Gore's plan.</p>
        <p>Historically, investing in the stock market has yielded a high rate of return, better than 7 percent from 1926 through 1997, according to the Bush campaign. But there have been long periods when the market has been down, and not every investor has chosen the right stocks. Investing in safer alternatives, like bonds, reduces the rate of return along with the risk. And Democrats point out that most workers are already subject to considerable risk through 401(k)'s and other retirement accounts.</p>
