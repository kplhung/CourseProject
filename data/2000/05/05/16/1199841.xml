        <p>Addictive and compulsive disorders are notoriously difficult to treat, particularly when they involve a substance or behavior that, when used or practiced normally, is an essential or important part of life, like eating or sex.

        <p>Addictive and compulsive disorders are notoriously difficult to treat, particularly when they involve a substance or behavior that, when used or practiced normally, is an essential or important part of life, like eating or sex. When people lose control of such behaviors, the goal of treatment is not to cut them out completely, as might be done with alcohol or nicotine, but to re-establish a healthier pattern of use.</p>
        <p>This is certainly the case for a recently recognized, fast-growing form of out-of-control sexual activity known as cybersex addiction or compulsivity in which people may spend dozens of hours a week online viewing sites that cater to sexual titillation and satisfaction. In treating cybersex addiction, the aim is not to deprive those afflicted of access to computers or sexual outlets but to prevent their abuse.</p>
        <p>Before treatment for any disorder can begin, a proper diagnosis must be made. Someone has to recognize that a problem exists and the person afflicted has to acknowledge that the need for help to overcome it. As with other addictions, denial is a common element in cybersex addiction, and people typically maintain that denial until the bottom falls out, for example, with breakup of a marriage or loss of a job.</p>
        <p>Partners of cybersex addicts are also sometimes in denial, distressed by a seriously disturbed emotional and sexual relationship but relieved that the addict is not pursuing real-life sex with strangers. A partner's first task, then, is to recognize the early signs of cybersex abuse. Dr. Kimberly S. Young of the Center for Online Addiction in Bradford, Pa., and her co-authors describe the signs of trouble in an article on online infidelity in the current issue of the journal Sexual Addiction and Compulsivity. They include:</p>
        <p>A CHANGE IN SLEEP PATTERNS -- Online meeting places typically heat up in the wee hours, and cybersex compulsives often stay up later and later for the action. Or they may arise early for private computer time.</p>
        <p>A DEMAND FOR PRIVACY -- Dr. Al Cooper of Stanford University and colleagues found in a survey of more than 9,000 visitors to online sex-related sites that 72 percent of men and 62 percent of women kept secret how much time they spent online for sexual pursuits. An online sex addict may move the computer into a secluded area or room where the door can be locked and may react with anger or defensiveness if disturbed or interrupted while online.</p>
        <p>IGNORING OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES -- The cybersex addict may spend more and more hours ''at the office'' at the expense of family time, or become so fixated on online sex that ordinary chores are ignored, like doing the dishes or laundry. In more than one case, parents have forgotten to pick up their children at school or an activity.</p>
        <p>EVIDENCE OF LYING -- An addict may hide credit card bills for online services and lie about the reason for their extensive use of the Internet. Addicts may also promise their partners that they will quit or cut back their Internet use, but the effort is typically short-lived and frequently repeated.</p>
        <p>PERSONALITY CHANGES -- ''A person is often surprised and confused to see how much their partner's moods and behaviors have changed since the Internet engulfed them,'' wrote Dr. Young, who is the author of ''Caught in the Net'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1998). ''A once warm and sensitive wife becomes cold and withdrawn. A formerly jovial husband turns quiet and brooding.'' And if the cybersex abuser is questioned about the relationship between these changes and Internet activity, there is a tendency to shift the blame to the nonoffending partner.</p>
        <p>LOST INTEREST IN PARTNER SEX -- Many cybersex addicts have little or no interest in or energy left for more normal sexual outlets. Partners are often mystified by the demise of their sex lives and, if they know about the online activity, may despair of competing with idealized computer images.</p>
        <p>LESS INTEREST IN FAMILY -- People have just so much time and energy; if much is devoted to online sex, little is left for family rituals and outings or for building intimacy.</p>
        <p>As with most people who compulsively pursue an addictive substance or behavior, people hooked on online sex rarely seek treatment unless a crisis, like the loss of a spouse or a job, forces them to try to regain control. Even then, therapists say, cybersex addiction is difficult to treat, even more difficult than off-line compulsive sexual activity.</p>
        <p>As with substance abuse, a common recommendation for those trying to break a cybersex addiction is to join a 12-step program patterned on Alcoholics Anonymous. There are several for sex addicts, including Sex Addicts Anonymous, Sexaholics Anonymous and Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jennifer Schneider of Tucson, co-author with Burt Schneider of ''Sex, Lies and Forgiveness: Couples Speaking on Healing From Sex Addiction,'' points out that there is little point in normal partners' trying to reduce the lure of the Internet by agreeing to sexual practices that make them uncomfortable or by trying to improve their appearance with plastic surgery.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Schneider does suggest some changes involving the computer: moving it to an open area; using it only for specific, planned tasks; not using the Internet or going online only when other family members are present, adding Net safety tools and screens and arranging for accountability regarding Internet access at work.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mark Schwartz of the Masters and Johnson in St. Louis says most cybersex addicts also need professional help. ''Treatment is much slower than with other addictions,'' he said. ''It's a long, winding road with lots of lapses, relapses and acting out.''</p>
        <p>His treatment approach often includes the use of a Prozaclike drug, which counters underlying depression, suppresses the sex drive and makes treating the addictive behavior easier. Most effective, Dr. Schwartz said, is group therapy, which helps the addicts confront the way their behavior has taken over their lives. It may take four to five months before a cybersex addict is ready to begin serious efforts at controlling the behavior, and effective therapy can take as much as a year, he said.</p>
        <p>The partners of cybersex addicts also usually need professional help, Dr. Schneider said. Partners need confirmation that a real and serious problem exists and the realization that they did not cause the problem, cannot control it and cannot cure it.</p>
        <p>They need help in repairing their self-esteem and in learning to pay attention to their own needs and desires. People concerned about their use of the Internet for sexual satisfaction and their partners' can consult a helpful Web site established by Dr. Dana Putnam of San Luis Obispo, Calif.: www.onlinesexaddict.org.</p>
