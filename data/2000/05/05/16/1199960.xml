        <p>For the first time in almost four years, Israelis and Palestinian forces exchanged gunfire in the West Bank today as a wave of violent protest swept through the Palestinian territories. Despite the fighting, Prime Minister Ehud Barak won his Parliament's approval to cede three villages near Jerusalem to the Palestinian Authority in an effort to advance the peace talks.</p>
        <p>The gun battle, which broke out at a junction near the Palestinian city of Ramallah, accompanied chaotic confrontations throughout the West Bank and Gaza, in which Israeli forces suppressed unruly Palestinian demonstrators by shooting tear gas, rubber-coated bullets and, at some sites, live ammunition into crowds charging at them with stones and firebombs.</p>
        <p>In the chaos of the rioting, live bullets suddenly appeared to fly at the Israeli troops from Palestinian military policemen stationed on the  hilltop north of Ramallah. The Israeli troops immediately responded with live fire, and for several hours they and the Palestinian police exchanged automatic weapons fire.</p>
        <p>Late tonight, armed Palestinian men attacked Joseph's Tomb, an Israeli enclave in Nablus, shooting and throwing firebombs. Another shootout ensued, in which one Palestinian youth was killed.</p>
        <p>Palestinian officials said that three Palestinians had been killed, a police officer and two youths, and that 350 had been wounded. Israeli officials said six Israeli soldiers had been wounded.</p>
        <p>The demonstrations marked the anniversary of what the Palestinians term the ''nakba,'' or ''catastrophe,'' that accompanied the birth of Israel, and they were also called to demand the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. But the violence expressed deep-seated frustrations among many Palestinians, especially with the failure of the 1993 Oslo peace agreement to change their lives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, spoke by telephone tonight, and communicated through advisers several times during the day.</p>
        <p>Information about the violence in the West Bank slowly seeped through Parliament, embroiled in its own struggles. And since the shooting was seized upon by the right wing as justification for concerns about the Palestinians, it was met with sober-minded calm by the government. Officials said they did not know the facts, and did not want to overreact.</p>
        <p>Though three parties in the prime minister's fractious, six-party coalition did not support him and one quit the government, Parliament voted 56 to 48 to authorize the long-delayed, much-disputed transfer of the three villages to full Palestinian control, which was originally intended by Mr. Barak as a gesture of good will.</p>
        <p>The move has ended up as an 11th-hour offering to salvage a faltering peace effort as talks were stalled by the growing violence and the senior Palestinian negotiator quit.</p>
        <p>Palestinian officials publicly expressed no thanks tonight for the three dusty, pothole-ridden villages, over which they have exercised civil control since December 1995. In a speech to the Parliament, Mr. Barak  made it clear that Abu Dis, one of the villages, was meant as a substitute for East Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>''We will be in Jerusalem, and they in Abu Dis,'' Mr. Barak said as he sought to explain why the concession of an Arab village did not seem like a surrender from his point of view.</p>
        <p>This infuriated the Palestinians, who publicly aspire to make East Jerusalem the capital of their future state. Yasir Abed Rabbo, a senior Palestinian official, dismissed the transfer as a ''symbolic step.''</p>
        <p>After the Parliament vote, as darkness brought calm to most of the West Bank and Gaza, tens of thousands of Jewish settlers filled the heart of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>It was the first mass right-wing protest against the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations since Mr. Barak was elected last May. From above, television cameras captured a sea of yarmulkes that filled Zion Square and the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall.</p>
        <p>''The government has bowed to the Palestinian rioters,'' said Ariel Sharon, leader of the opposition Likud Party. ''On the day they shoot, it is handing them territory.''</p>
        <p>Barely miles apart, the violence in the West Bank and the political turbulence in the Israeli Parliament seemed to be taking place on different planes of reality. Israeli lawmakers, convening for the opening of the  summer session, bustled through the halls of Parliament, focused on the  political game at hand: who would vote how and whether it would reshape the government.</p>
        <p>''What is actually happening in Ramallah?'' Yitzhak Herzog, the cabinet secretary and a senior adviser to Mr. Barak, asked in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>When someone said Palestinian streets were exploding from pent-up frustration, he gestured around him. ''Talk about frustration,'' he said. ''This is frustration!''</p>
        <p>In the streets of the Palestinian territories -- in Bethlehem, Ramallah, Hebron, Jenin, Nablus, Tulkarm and Gaza -- Parliament's vote  seemed distant and irrelevant. The demonstrators chanted, burned tires and hurled stones and firebombs at Israeli soldiers, venting rage in a way that at times verged on giddy, defiant festivity.</p>
        <p>''We are here not only to demand the release of our prisoners but to say that the peace process is a game and it has failed,'' said one teen-age  protester at the Bet El junction north of Ramallah.</p>
        <p>Israeli officials suggested that the Palestinian leadership had fomented  the trouble to threaten the Israelis into making concessions.</p>
        <p>But Palestinian leaders indicated that what they had done was step aside and let the people express themselves, until the violence got out of hand. Then they worked to quell it.</p>
        <p>''There was close contact throughout the day between our commanders and theirs,'' Mr. Barak said in Parliament. ''That doesn't always work. The issue will have to be investigated. I am not certain that at every moment and at every stage there was willingness on the other side to act resolutely in order to stop it.'' Mr. Barak said he would delay the physical transfer of the villages until the situation was calm and it was clear what happened.</p>
        <p>In the confusion, Mr. Abed Rabbo, the senior Palestinian negotiator, quit his post, saying back-channel negotiations were making the official, American-mediated ones meaningless. Back-channel talks began in Stockholm several days ago between Shlomo Ben Ami, the Israeli Internal Security Minister; Gilad Scher, an Israeli lawyer; Ahmed Qurei, the speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council also known as Abu Ala, and Hassan Asfour, a Palestinian cabinet minister. Palestinian and Israeli security officials are also holding talks on the quiet.</p>
        <p>''This is an Israeli game,'' Mr. Abed Rabbo said, suggesting that the Americans were encouraging it, too. ''The Israelis think that if they use several channels at once, they will find cracks in the Palestinian position. So I am insisting on one channel, one team and one position, and I leave it to those in Sweden.''</p>
        <p>Dennis Ross, the American envoy, left Washington for the region to resume mediation, the State Department said.</p>
        <p>Given the day's violence, Mr. Barak found himself in an awkward position when he argued in Parliament that sober-minded compromises in an intelligent negotiation were the only defense against the  descent into chaos and bloodshed.</p>
        <p>As right-wingers heckled, he delivered a disjointed speech in which he defended his diplomatic moves and uncharacteristically belittled the opposition as petty, fear-mongering and hypocritical. The Likud government that preceded his made numerous concessions to the Palestinians  and serious missteps, he said. ''Don't preach level-headedness and security activity to us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, Mr. Barak, also uncharacteristically, took on Mr. Sharon, a fellow former general who served as defense minister in the previous government. ''Don't tell us tales about Jerusalem,'' he said. ''You handed over Hebron, you recognized a Palestinian state in Gaza, and you brought Clinton there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon responded, ''That's a libel.'' Mr. Barak shot back, ''You are an old hand complaining about libels,'' referring to Mr. Sharon's history of filing libel lawsuits.</p>
        <p>The opposition, and even members of his own government, were trying to portray the transfer of the villages as a security risk and an indication that Mr. Barak will eventually capitulate to the Palestinians' demand for a piece of Jerusalem itself.</p>
        <p>The National Religious Party, which represents religious Zionists, including settlers, announced that its five members of Parliament would  leave the government over the vote.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Barak has been actively negotiating for the support of  Shas, an ultra-Orthodox, Sephardic party with 17 Parliament seats, Shas ministers and many members of Parliament walked out of the proceedings and did not vote. Those who stayed opposed the government.</p>
        <p>Yisrael B'Aliya, the Russian immigrant party led by Interior Minister Natan Sharansky, is also considering quitting the coalition, which would reduce Mr. Barak's government to minority status. ''Natan is  determined to leave,'' said Yuli Edelstein, a party member, ''not because anyone fell in love with Abu Dis, but because if you give Abu Dis as a down payment, the final payment will be half of Jerusalem.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharansky spoke at the settlers' rally tonight. It was a tightly controlled demonstration, and its organizers repeatedly appealed to the crowd to keep calm. There were still some blunt signs: Mr. Arafat's face as a skull; a homemade poster that said, ''Mr. Barak has forgotten thee, O Jerusalem.''</p>
        <p>Ora Zimmer, 64, a retired researcher from Hebrew University, said she thought that the government was about to ''put Jerusalem under siege.''</p>
        <p>''How can we talk about peace today?'' she said. ''They showed us  today what kind of peace we'll have.''</p>
