        <p>In a bitterly worded rebuttal, the New York Police Department has denounced a draft report by the United States Civil Rights Commission that accused the police of racial profiling. The department asserted that the panel's research was slipshod and its conclusions recklessly unfair.</p>
        <p>The vehemence of the department's rebuttal, which is scheduled to be delivered to the commission in Washington today, was also suggested by the length of the response -- 700 pages. The panel's report was 250 pages long.</p>
        <p>In the response, the department says the panel was unfairly selective in its use of facts and relied too heavily on what it characterized as the unsupported allegations of a set of regular critics of the Police Department, including the Rev. Al Sharpton and Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.</p>
        <p>''The report is an unfortunate exercise in shoddy reporting, in lieu of legitimate research methods, in order to publicly defame the reputation of the department,'' the rebuttal says. ''As such, the report is so poorly prepared that it is an embarrassment to the United States government.''</p>
        <p>In its draft report, the panel, an advisory body made up of four Democrats, three independents and one Republican, characterized the Police Department's approach to  race relations as seriously flawed and said  the department's own data suggested that its officers had routinely stopped black and Hispanic people largely because of their race.</p>
        <p>Although Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has dismissed the commission report as an attempt to help his possible rival for the United States Senate, Hillary Rodham Clinton, police officials said they would leave it to others to decide whether the commission's motivations were political.</p>
        <p>The commission declined to comment yesterday on the police response, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times from a police official. Ruby G. Moy, director of the commission staff, said that the panel had not received a copy yet, but pointed out that in remarks on Friday, the panel's general counsel, Edward Hailes, had defended the professionalism and the fairness of the commission's efforts.</p>
        <p>''The findings and recommendations, if accepted, are fact-based and not extreme,'' Mr. Hailes said on Friday.</p>
        <p>The city's Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent panel that investigates allegations of police misconduct, is sending the commission its own response to the draft report. The draft had recommended improvements in the review board's procedures. The mayor's office will not respond to the draft report directly, said Sunny Mindel, a spokeswoman for the mayor.</p>
        <p>The city's responses will be reviewed by the executive staff, which will consider possible revisions to the report before the commission's next meeting on June 16, said Kim Alton, a commission spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>The commission's draft report cited an array of deficiencies in the department, from its efforts to recruit minorities to the way it teaches officers about cultural diversity. But police officials appeared to be most stung by a finding that that the department disproportionately stopped blacks and Hispanics during street patrols by aggressive anti-crime units. For example, the draft report found fault with the fact that 51 percent of those stopped on Staten Island were black, even though the borough's population is only 9 percent black.</p>
        <p>''For such a critically serious finding, the report does not contain a shred of the necessary analysis to even try to prove its apparently predisposed conclusion,'' the department's response states.</p>
        <p>The police response, which was crafted by the department's lawyers, says more minority residents are stopped because more officers are deployed in high-crime neighborhoods with large minority populations. In addition, it says the race of those stopped corresponds roughly with the race of criminal suspects as reported to the police.</p>
        <p>The draft report had dismissed this argument, asserting that in most cases, officers had confronted people on the basis of their own observations, not identifications by victims or witnesses. But in their response, the police suggest that most stops occur precisely because an officer is familiar with the general description of a criminal who may have been involved in a pattern of robberies or violent gang activities.</p>
        <p>''Unless the commission is suggesting that officers ignore descriptions and continuing crime patterns, this information will and should be utilized to help develop reasonable suspicion to legally stop a person,'' the response says.</p>
        <p>The police analysis appears to be at odds with the findings of a report last year by Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer, which concluded that officers stopped citizens on the basis of their resemblance to a known criminal suspect only about 30 percent of the time. Police officials at the time said that that study was flawed.</p>
        <p>City and police officials said they were pushing to have their responses published as an appendix to the final version of the report. But they said the draft report had already damaged the department by maligning its programs to recruit and promote black and Hispanic officers while ignoring its success in reducing police shootings.</p>
        <p>''Where do we go to get our reputation back?'' asked George Grasso, the Police Department's deputy commissioner for legal affairs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grasso said he was not impressed by parts of the draft report in which the commission credited the department with improvements, such as one section citing increased public confidence in the department's ability to resolve incidents of police misconduct.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grasso said he viewed those sections as disingenuous, especially since he felt so many other parts of the report were distorted. For example, he criticized the commission for referring several times in the report to its difficulty in getting the department to turn over relevant documents.</p>
        <p>''They were never denied any information request by the N.Y.P.D.,'' he said.</p>
