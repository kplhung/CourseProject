        <p>The American fashion industry has been indebted to Miuccia Prada for several seasons, and it looks as if she is still the boss designer. Her shapes, her colors, her peculiar sense of luxury were everywhere last week as retailers scouted the latest fall accessories, and don't let some copycat tell you, ''It's just in the air.''</p>
        <p>One spin around the Accessory Circuit, a trade show at Piers 92 and 94, told the story. The most ubiquitous handbag came in a half-moon shape (think bowling ball dimensions) with clutch handles and a retro color palette that favored maroon and light blue. Sound familiar? Prada did the bowling bag for spring. If the Italian company has moved on for fall, with its version of the doctor bag, others are trying to keep up. Zerafa, a new company based in California, was displaying a pair of rounded bags its representative, Jenn Caig, called ''the large and small doctor.'' But, in fact, they still looked more like a strike and a spare.</p>

        <p>The American fashion industry has been indebted to Miuccia Prada for several seasons, and it looks as if she is still the boss designer. Her shapes, her colors, her peculiar sense of luxury were everywhere last week as retailers scouted the latest fall accessories, and don't let some copycat tell you, ''It's just in the air.''</p>
        <p>One spin around the Accessory Circuit, a trade show at Piers 92 and 94, told the story. The most ubiquitous handbag came in a half-moon shape (think bowling ball dimensions) with clutch handles and a retro color palette that favored maroon and light blue. Sound familiar? Prada did the bowling bag for spring. If the Italian company has moved on for fall, with its version of the doctor bag, others are trying to keep up. Zerafa, a new company based in California, was displaying a pair of rounded bags its representative, Jenn Caig, called ''the large and small doctor.'' But, in fact, they still looked more like a strike and a spare.</p>
        <p>Ms. Prada's fall collection also included fur tippets tied loosely at the neck. These were worn in a slightly careless manner, over simple knits and sparkling evening sequins alike, and they made one think of a tipsy but well-dressed matron emerging from Cipriani as she hastily readjusts her clothes. On a gray dress form positioned outside Elizabeth Gillett's booth at Pier 94, the tippet seemed to lose some of its power. Still, the style will be among the most prominent for fall.</p>
        <p>''We feel there's a major opportunity in fur -- fur handbags, fur berets, fur-trimmed shoes and boots, and fur neck pieces,'' said Sandra Wilson, the accessories fashion director at Neiman Marcus. ''It's part of a luxury statement in all fashion categories.'' Dana Christy, who buys accessories for Saks Fifth Avenue, agreed, adding that the most forward trends in handbags, scarves and other accessories came from ready-to-wear designers like Ms. Prada, Donatella Versace and Karl Lagerfeld of Chanel.</p>
        <p>But most manufacturers have been a step behind. ''I found that the accessories market was way out of sync with what was going on in ready-to-wear this season,'' Ms. Christy said. ''Designers were into ladylike, put-together clothes while the accessories people were still doing bohemian.''</p>
        <p>Certainly there was a feeling of redundancy as one trooped down the aisles at Pier 94 looking for signs of genuine novelty among so many beaded or patchwork handbags.</p>
        <p>''I'm tired of all the embellishment,'' said Lisa Glass, a buyer for Boyd's, a Philadelphia store owned by her father, Jerry Gushner. Ms. Glass was with Debbie Blank, another Boyd's buyer, inspecting soft totes in tweed and camel fabrics at the Clever Carriage Company's booth.</p>
        <p>Kim Isaacsohn, the owner of the company, which she describes as ''the ultimate lifestyle collection for clever people,'' was warming up with her sales pitch. ''The Louis Vuitton and Prada bags are very heavy,'' said Ms. Isaacsohn, who worked for the British retailer Marks &amp; Spencer before starting her company. ''We don't have a chauffeur to carry our handbags.''</p>
        <p>As Ms. Glass was saying she thought the tweedy bags jibed with fall's casual chic, Liliane Wancer, who runs a buying office whose clients include Lane Crawford in Hong Kong, stopped by. She ticked off the big trends: ''Gold. Lots of big hoop earrings. Tweeds. Big bags. Small bags are disappearing. Very ladylike looks.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wancer said it's understandable if stores often gravitate toward a single dominant style, like the Prada bowling bag, even if such a look is widely copied. ''A woman wants something that says to her friends, 'I'm in fashion,' '' Ms. Wancer said. ''Everybody needs direction.''</p>
        <p>Accessories are a big business. According to the NPD Group, a research firm that tracks apparel and accessory sales, more than $1 billion was spent on handbags alone last year. Many companies, like Gucci, Prada, Louis Vuitton and Tod's, have found a successful niche in the $500 to $900 luxury category, though most sales, the NPD Group reported, are at much lower prices. The fact that many of the accessory designers interviewed at the pier show started their businesses less than two years ago is another indication of the market's strength.</p>
        <p>Stephanie Layne was working for a doctor's office when she and Jill Roeb, a promotions manager for Warner Brothers, started their hair ornament and jewelry business, Haute Stuff, a couple of years ago. Today, their Los Angeles-based company sells such things as suede headbands and paillette-embellished necklaces to stores like Henri Bendel and Nordstrom. ''The accessories business is so competitive,'' Ms. Layne said, ''you have to constantly come up with something new.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wilson of Neiman Marcus added: ''I think everyone wants to get in on a look. The key is to know when to stay with it, and when to move on.''</p>
        <p>As insipid as the trend toward ladylike dressing may sometimes seem -- with its conscientious revival of suits, pumps and those overtly old-money gestures like pearls and tweeds -- it is giving new life to accessories like belts and scarves. Ms. Christy of Saks pointed to the oblong scarves that Mr. Lagerfeld showed at Chanel with suits and flaring coats, and to the suede belts with trophy-size buckles at Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Versace.</p>
        <p>''I thought Versace looked brilliant -- bombshell sex,'' Ms. Christy said. ''This is the confident femme fatale, unlike the polished one.''</p>
        <p>For polish and money, there is what Ms. Wilson calls ''the finishing touches,'' so vital, apparently, in a season of put-together dressing. That might mean a crocodile handbag, fur-trimmed boots or a pair of rimless aviator sunglasses.</p>
        <p>''Or it could be all of that together on the right person,'' Ms. Wilson said.</p>
        <p>Python and animal prints are everywhere for fall, too. ''It's sex and fashion,'' said Barbra Musial, the vice president for sales at Eric Javits, as she put on a fuzzy leopard-print cowboy hat called Bonanza.</p>
        <p>''And she was a bonanza, too, in sales,'' said Ms. Musial, who refers to all of Mr. Javits's hats -- Lucky, Dude and the other new styles -- by the female pronoun. Ms. Musial said fedoras will be big for fall, but there is still action in the sexier Bonanza, which she calls a ranch hat, ''because that's where the money is going now, to ranches in Montana.''</p>
        <p>Trade shows tend to be down-to-earth reminders that not everyone is ready for the latest topper or tippet. ''In 32 years, I've seen everything,'' said Selma Pustin, the owner of a store in Baltimore called That Handbag Place, as she and Emily Rosenthal-Levitas, a buyer, stopped to speak to a reporter. They were dubious about the prospects in Baltimore for doctor or bowling bags. They seemed more confident about handbags trimmed with brightly colored beads, as long as it wasn't overdone.</p>
        <p>''We still have women who come in for those nylon bags,'' Ms. Pustin said with a sigh, referring to the older Prada style.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rosenthal-Levitas gave a knowing laugh and said to the reporter: ''Aren't you glad you stopped us?''</p>
