        <p>First, Anthony Carter emerged from anonymity with tales of $1,000 playground games to become the unlikely hero of Game 3 for the Miami Heat. Then, in Game 4, Charlie Ward wiped off the criticism that has fallen on him like rain throughout his Knicks career and played savior on Sunday.</p>
        <p>In a series in which almost every X and O is accounted for in marathon film sessions, Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy and Heat Coach Pat Riley still fear the unknown: the player who slips through the cracks in the reams of videotapes.</p>
        <p>It was Carter stepping in for Tim Hardaway and winning Game 3 with a circus shot with 2.2 seconds remaining in overtime last Friday night. It was Ward leading the Knicks in scoring in each of their two victories -- a feat he accomplished only twice in the regular season -- to tie the series at 2-2.</p>
        <p>''That happens always in the playoffs,'' said Don Chaney, an assistant coach for the Knicks. ''It's not always the stars who really are the X-factor in terms of wins and losses. It's always an unknown, a guy who's not normally known for doing certain things, either a bench player or a starter, as in Charlie's case, who normally doesn't put up the big numbers. Those are the people who normally are the key factors in whether you win or lose on a consistent basis in the playoffs.''</p>
        <p>For Ward, scoring 20 points Sunday, a postseason high, brought about disparate opinions. The Knicks looked at his performance as the answer to the defensive pressure by the Heat. Ward was the safety valve, the one to send the ball flying toward when the double-teams came on Allan Houston, Latrell Sprewell and Patrick Ewing.</p>
        <p>But Carter, Ward's counterpoint, thought that Ward's points were a worthless, garbage-time contribution. While Carter's opinion that the game was already decided when Ward ran off the final 9 points is debatable, that Ward unexpectedly provided an offensive burst is not.</p>
        <p>The Knicks looked to their point guard for an advantage in trying to expose the ailing Hardaway and the inexperienced Carter. Now that Ward has responded, the Knicks have posed a choice to the Heat: ease the double-teaming on Houston or Sprewell, or gamble that Ward will not strike again.</p>
        <p>''Look, Miami is a great defensive team,'' Ewing said, whose 12.8 points a game this series have been matched by Ward. ''They're going to try to do things to take the ball out of Latrell, Allan and my hands. Somebody has to step up. I'm not going to say it's going to be Charlie every night. Somebody is going to have to step up and get the job done.''</p>
        <p>Riley coached Ward during the point guard's rookie season with the Knicks in 1994-95 and has expressed respect for his skills, maybe more respect than Ward gets now. But given the choice, the Knicks expect the Heat to dare Ward to prove he can do it again.</p>
        <p>''They said it wasn't scaring them, but who cares,'' Houston said. ''The series is tied and, if anything, they know he's capable. I think they'll try to play the same way. What helps is we were able to get the ball where we wanted to get it. Sometimes if you let them force your way out, they don't have to double. But if we drive the ball in the paint or post up in the paint, whether they double or not, something good is going to happen.''</p>
        <p>Sprewell said: ''As well as he was doing yesterday, there's no way they can leave him if he plays like that. I don't know if that's asking a lot or not, but he was in a zone yesterday. If he's that hot, they're going to have to do something about it.''</p>
        <p>Chaney agreed, adding: ''I don't think they'll say, 'O.K., we have to focus on Charlie and not focus on Allan and Sprewell.' I think what they're saying is: 'Charlie has a great game. It probably was an unusual thing. We've got to check him but we still have to keep our main focus on Sprewell and Allan and secondarily, Patrick and Larry. You did it once. O.K., now prove to us that that wasn't a freak thing.' ''</p>
        <p>Whether or not Carter is correct in his harsh assessment of Ward, the Knick did contribute more than just points on Sunday. Ward also gave the Knicks the sort of emotion, aggressiveness and desperation they needed if they hoped to squeeze past the Heat.</p>
        <p>''Just because we won a game doesn't mean we're in a good position,'' Houston said. ''We have to make it that way. And this is going to be a golden opportunity for us to do that. I'm not going to say we're in a hole, but I'd say they're in a better position than we are.''</p>
        <p>Ewing said: ''People thought we were going to come in and sweep them. We came in here knowing it was going to be a dogfight and we're prepared for that.''</p>
