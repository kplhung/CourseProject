        <p>Even as United Nations officials today confirmed the release of 139 peacekeepers held hostage by rebels, thereby delivering the best piece of news since the beginning of a humiliating month in this corner of Africa, there was hardly ringing praise for the man who had made it all possible.</p>
        <p>''Whatever you might think or say of the role of President Charles Taylor in the Sierra Leone crisis,'' Oluyemi Adeniji, the United Nations special envoy to Sierra Leone, said at a news conference, ''I think you have to admit that he is playing a positive role.''</p>
        <p>The comments signaled the unease of the United Nations in dealing with Mr. Taylor, the former warlord who terrorized a population into making him president of Liberia, after fruitless negotiations with Sierra Leone's top warlord, Foday Sankoh, led to the current crisis. Indeed, Mr. Taylor has for years been the principal ally of Mr. Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front, allowing the rebel group to smuggle diamonds through Liberia and making arms available to it.</p>
        <p>And so, a week after Mr. Sankoh disappeared from his home in the capital and Mr. Taylor was asked by neighboring countries to act as a mediator in the hostage crisis, the rebels released the 139 hostages -- with 347 now left.</p>
        <p>The 139 hostages, whose condition was not clear, were taken out of eastern Sierra Leone on Sunday night and sent across the border into Liberian custody in a town called Foya, said David Wimhurst, the spokesman for the United Nations force. They were being flown today to the Liberian capital, Monrovia, before their scheduled return here tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adeniji, who visited Mr. Taylor in Monrovia on Sunday, said the hostages had been released ''unconditionally.'' But Mr. Taylor appeared to want an immediate cessation of hostilities, saying that the lives of the remaining hostages might be in danger if pro-government forces continued pushing rebels east into the hinterland in ''R.U.F. areas,'' Mr. Adeniji said.</p>
        <p>''He mentioned specifically the case of Masiaka,'' Mr. Adeniji said.</p>
        <p>Masiaka, an important junction town only 40 miles from the capital, has been the center of battle in recent days. The town had been under government control before the rebel uprising early this month, and drawing the line there would increase rebel-held territory and widen the distance to the all-important diamond mines in the east.</p>
        <p>It was unclear how that issue could be resolved. Secretary General Kofi Annan said in New York today that all of Sierra Leone should be brought under government control. ''You cannot have a state where a group of rebels arrogate to themselves the right to exploit the riches of the country, either for themselves or for a war,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The release of the hostages underscored Mr. Taylor's continuing influence over the Revolutionary United Front despite what appeared to be a cooling in his relationship with Mr. Sankoh a few months ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor, a convict who bribed his way out a Massachusetts prison, where he was awaiting extradition to  Liberia on embezzlement charges, began his brutal war in Liberia in 1989. Mr. Taylor needed Sierra Leone's diamonds to finance his war, and became allied with Mr. Sankoh, who began his movement in Sierra Leone in 1991.</p>
        <p>Through the years, the two men were allies in their respective wars and used similar strategies -- kidnapping children, turning them into soldiers through forced use of drugs, deliberately attacking civilians to create terror. In 1998, Liberians elected him president, mainly because they were tired of war and believed that Mr. Taylor would take up arms if he did not win.</p>
        <p>Since becoming president, Mr. Taylor has tried to burnish his image. Last year, he played a crucial role in the Sierra Leone peace talks by encouraging Mr. Sankoh to sign the accord. He was rewarded in July when President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah of Sierra Leone and President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, which had fought against Mr. Taylor as part of a West African intervention force, went to Monrovia to commemorate the three-year anniversary of the end of the Liberian war.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Taylor apparently thought he had not been rewarded sufficiently for his involvement.</p>
        <p>''He usually complains that he has not gotten any aid from the West and he needs it to rebuild his country,'' said a diplomat who was involved in the peace negotiations.</p>
        <p>Liberia continued to be a conduit for diamonds smuggled out of Sierra Leone. According to the Diamonds High Council in Antwerp, Sierra Leone exported only $31 million in diamonds last year; Liberia, which has far fewer diamond mines, exported $298 million.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Sankoh joined a power-sharing government here last year and was made chairman of a commission that oversees the nation's mineral resources, he made plans to deal directly with diamond dealers in the West, effectively cutting out Mr. Taylor from the picture, government officials here said.</p>
        <p>That plan seemed to have strained the two men's relationship. Sam ''Mosquito'' Bockarie, who had been the rebel group's field commander and was close to Mr. Taylor, fled Sierra Leone after a falling out with Mr. Sankoh late last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bockarie remained in exile in Liberia with men loyal to him. On Sunday night, he spoke in Monrovia at the presidency, saying that the rebels here should stop fighting with the United Nations force. He denied that he was involved in the crisis here. ''It is just fabrication,'' he said. ''I will not go back there after they have spoiled things with the U.N. If I go there, I am going to mess myself up.''</p>
        <p>So with Mr. Sankoh still missing, Mr. Taylor seems to be the best hope of the United Nations and the government of Sierra Leone in obtaining the release of the remaining hostages and in dealing with the Revolutionary United Front.</p>
        <p>''Our interest is the stability of Sierra Leone and so it is in our interest to maintain good relations with Liberia,'' said Septimus Kaikai, the spokesman for President Kabbah. ''I don't know what President Taylor's motivation is. But politics makes strange bedfellows.''</p>
