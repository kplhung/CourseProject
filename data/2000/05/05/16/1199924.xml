        <p>In Bobby Valentine's 10 major league seasons, he never played in 120 games. He never had 400 at-bats. Playing part time was difficult, and it was a skill he never mastered. His playing days were over by his 30th birthday.</p>
        <p>Valentine, the Mets manager, said the younger a player is, the tougher it is to be a reserve. He has a young bench now, filled with players who say they know they will hit if given the chance. But Benny Agbayani, Joe McEwing, Melvin Mora, Jon Nunnally and Jay Payton -- all 27- or 28-year-old outfielders -- have yet to establish themselves as everyday major leaguers.</p>

        <p>In Bobby Valentine's 10 major league seasons, he never played in 120 games. He never had 400 at-bats. Playing part time was difficult, and it was a skill he never mastered. His playing days were over by his 30th birthday.</p>
        <p>Valentine, the Mets manager, said the younger a player is, the tougher it is to be a reserve. He has a young bench now, filled with players who say they know they will hit if given the chance. But Benny Agbayani, Joe McEwing, Melvin Mora, Jon Nunnally and Jay Payton -- all 27- or 28-year-old outfielders -- have yet to establish themselves as everyday major leaguers.</p>
        <p>''I think they're confident, with the doubt that should be there because they haven't hit here at the major league level,'' Valentine said. ''The way it turns out, our games are less-than-relaxing-at-bat games. There aren't many at-bats that the guys have had where they can just worry about hitting.''</p>
        <p>The Mets are only one game above .500 as they open a three-game series with the Colorado Rockies tonight, and they have lost 9 of their last 13 games. During that stretch, Derek Bell, Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike Piazza have hit .336. The average of the rest of the team is .194.</p>
        <p>The Mets need more production in the innings in which Bell, Alfonzo and Piazza -- the Mets' 2-3-4 hitters -- do not bat. There are two spots open in the outfield, now that left fielder Rickey Henderson has been released and center fielder Darryl Hamilton is several weeks away from returning after toe surgery. In the clubhouse, there is an awareness of the opportunity.</p>
        <p>''I think they would like for one of us to step up and say, 'I want the job; I feel I should be out there every day,' '' Payton said. ''It makes it easier for them when they can say, 'We've got a guy that's doing the job every day, we can stick him out there.' It's a little harder when everybody's struggling.''</p>
        <p>After starting fast, Payton is batting .218. Agbayani is hitting .192 in games he starts. Nunnally is batting .200, McEwing has played in only two games and Mora is on the disabled list with a lacerated finger.</p>
        <p>''It's been unfortunate that every young outfielder or extra player has kind of gone into the same tank at the same time, which is peculiar,'' General Manager Steve Phillips said. ''But we seem to have a tendency of everybody feeling the same way at the plate at the same time.''</p>
        <p>McEwing has started well, delivering a run-scoring double on Sunday and also doubling on Saturday. A utility player in the mold of Mora -- versatile and scrappy -- McEwing was popular among his St. Louis teammates, many of whom were upset when he was traded for Jesse Orosco in spring training.</p>
        <p>McEwing batted .275 playing regularly as a rookie last year, but hit just .209 over the season's last two months. Phillips did not target him when he shopped Orosco, but he likes McEwing's situational hitting, ability to drive the ball and his attitude.</p>
        <p>''I just try to take advantage of every opportunity I can,'' McEwing said. ''The best way to go about it is to be prepared for any situation.''</p>
        <p>That was Payton's approach in spring training, when he was out of minor league options and knew the Mets would have to put him on the roster or expose him to other teams. Because Payton had so few major league at-bats before this year, Valentine said he thought it was important to play him often, the way he did with Roger Cedeno last year.</p>
        <p>But Payton has been streaky; he endured a 2-for-23 stretch, then had four multi-hit games in a row before starting his current 0-for-19 skid.</p>
        <p>''I put a little pressure on myself to perform, because I know if I do well, then I'm going to get a lot more playing time,'' Payton said. ''Basically, I'm thinking too much in the box instead of just getting in there, taking your time, saying, 'Relax, take a deep breath, take a nice little stride and hit the ball.' I've got a hundred things going through my head when I step in the box, from worrying about getting a hit and playing to worrying about my stride.''</p>
        <p>And yet, Payton said, he is having fun trying to figure it all out, because he knows he has the ability. ''I hit,'' he said. ''That's what I do.''</p>
        <p>The other outfielders have the same thoughts. Before he went on the disabled list Saturday, Mora acknowledged his struggles.</p>
        <p>''I've struck out like 1,000 times,'' he said. ''As soon as I find my swing again, I'm going to make a lot of pitchers pay.''</p>
        <p>Nunnally, the only left-handed-hitting outfielder until Hamilton returns, feels his swing is where he wants it to be. He said he is just missing pitches and does not pay much attention to his average.</p>
        <p>''I know the way my average looks, and I'm not that kind of hitter,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For now, Nunnally, Payton and the others have the luxury of a chance to improve on the spot. Hamilton may be limited to four games a week when he returns, and Phillips is trying to improve the outfield.</p>
        <p>But the Mets have traded many of their top prospects to assemble the current roster. And if they make a deal for an outfielder, they will almost certainly not include the Class AAA right-hander Grant Roberts. He was considered for a promotion last week and is especially important because the Mets have three potential free agents in the rotation.</p>
        <p>With few outfielders now available -- the Mets have no interest in the Cubs' Henry Rodriguez and Montreal's Rondell White is off the market -- the best the Mets may be able do is wait for someone to force himself into the lineup.</p>
        <p>''In the short term, we're comfortable with the options we have,'' Phillips said. ''We do need one or more of these guys to get hot and get on track.''</p>
