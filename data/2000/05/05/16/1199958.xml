      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Myles Brand, the president of Indiana University, showed lack of judgment and nerve yesterday when it came time to discipline his volatile, abusive basketball coach, Bob Knight. Instead of firing Mr. Knight for behavior that would not have been tolerated in any faculty member -- or for that matter, in any coach less successful at winning games and generating revenues -- he gave him only a very mild penalty. The punishment includes suspension for three games, a $30,000 fine and a demand that Coach Knight abide by a stringent code of conduct under which he can be dismissed for any inappropriate physical contact or other infractions.</p>
        <p>The punishment hardly seems sufficient for a pattern of verbal and physical abuse that has continued for decades. An investigation by the university confirmed that Coach Knight had abusive arguments or physical altercations with colleagues and subordinates, once grabbed a player's neck while berating him and intimidated an elderly secretary by cursing and throwing a vase at a wall near her. Other known and alleged incidents include hitting a  policeman in Puerto Rico, throwing a chair across the court in a game, punching an assistant, shoving a fan and using intemperate language.</p>

        <p>Myles Brand, the president of Indiana University, showed lack of judgment and nerve yesterday when it came time to discipline his volatile, abusive basketball coach, Bob Knight. Instead of firing Mr. Knight for behavior that would not have been tolerated in any faculty member -- or for that matter, in any coach less successful at winning games and generating revenues -- he gave him only a very mild penalty.

        <p>The punishment hardly seems sufficient for a pattern of verbal and physical abuse that has continued for decades. An investigation by the university confirmed that Coach Knight had abusive arguments or physical altercations with colleagues and subordinates, once grabbed a player's neck while berating him and intimidated an elderly secretary by cursing and throwing a vase at a wall near her. Other known and alleged incidents include hitting a  policeman in Puerto Rico, throwing a chair across the court in a game, punching an assistant, shoving a fan and using intemperate language.</p>
        <p>In justifying his leniency, Mr. Brand said that none of the individual incidents rose to the level of dismissal. He described Mr. Knight as a man of integrity, flawed by his temper but worthy of ''one last chance.'' The decision to retain him, Mr. Brand said, ''does not make him bigger than Indiana University.'' But that, of course, is exactly what the decision reveals -- an out-of-control coach whose three national championships, lifetime winning record and fan support make him invulnerable to appropriate punishment by the university.</p>
