        <p>The sense of smell, as Marcel Proust and his madeleine made clear, is intimately tied to feeling and memory.</p>
        <p>So it is perhaps not surprising that in schizophrenia, an illness that plays havoc with the emotional capacities of those who suffer from it, the sense of smell is impaired.</p>
        <p>People with schizophrenia often display what psychiatrists describe as a ''blunting'' of emotional response that makes it difficult for them to relate to others. But they also, researchers have found, show deficits in their ability to detect, identify and remember odors.</p>
        <p>Now a new study, appearing in this month's American Journal of Psychiatry, suggests that these abnormalities in the sense of smell have their root in abnormal brain structure.</p>
        <p>Using magnetic resonance imaging, Dr. Bruce Turetsky, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, and his colleagues examined the olfactory bulbs -- blueberry-sized organs that act as relay stations between the nose and brain -- in 26 schizophrenic patients and 22 comparison subjects.</p>
        <p>The bulbs of patients with schizophrenia, the researchers found, were on average 23 percent smaller in volume than those of control subjects.</p>
        <p>The discrepancy in size, said Dr. Turetsky, was large enough that it was clearly visible on the M.R.I. scans. And the difference between the groups persisted even after cigarette smoking, the use of anti-psychotic medications, age and other factors that might influence the size of the bulbs were taken into account.</p>
        <p>The study, said Dr. Robert Bilder, associate director for human research at the Center for Advanced Brain Imaging of the Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research in Orangeburg, N.Y., is, he believes, the first to reveal, in schizophrenia, a structural abnormality in more primitive brain areas, which are also involved in emotional processing.</p>
        <p>''For the last 10 or 20 years,'' Dr. Bilder said, schizophrenia researchers have paid ''an enormous amount of attention to the higher parts of the brain and the associated higher cognitive functions. This kind of a study is important in moving the focus to lower brain systems, that are crucial to the regulation of emotion and visceral functions.''</p>
        <p>Further investigation of the relationship between olfaction and schizophrenia, Dr. Turetsky said, may also help shed light on the emotional disturbances that are characteristic of the illness.</p>
        <p>''Smell is so tightly linked to emotional processing,'' Dr. Turetsky said. ''It's essentially impossible to present an olfactory stimulus that doesn't have an emotional valence to it.''</p>
        <p>The olfactory system offers scientists a unique window on both normal and abnormal brain functioning, in part because it is so clearly laid out, with sensory impulses traveling from receptors in the nose to the olfactory bulbs, where they are decoded, and then to olfactory centers in higher brain regions.</p>
        <p>And the changes in olfaction observed in schizophrenia, researchers believe, may also contain clues to how the disease develops. Many scientists suspect that schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder, a result of hereditary predisposition and some environmental insult, perhaps occurring during the early months of fetal growth.</p>
        <p>Whether the smaller size of the olfactory bulbs in schizophrenia reflects abnormalities occurring early in development or stems from a degenerative process later in life is still unknown, Dr. Turetsky said. But, he pointed out, olfactory neurons, unlike those in other areas of the brain, die and are replaced throughout life, displaying a plasticity that makes the olfactory system relatively resistant to degenerative disease.</p>
        <p>A loss of smell or abnormalities in odor identification or detection is also seen in some degenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's. The next task facing the researchers, said Dr. John Q. Trojanowski, a professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at Penn, is to show that the smaller volume of the olfactory bulbs is specific to schizophrenia and is not found in other illnesses, like manic depression, alcoholism or dementia.</p>
        <p>Although scientists have been studying the brains of patients with schizophrenia for a century or more, no one appears to have ever noticed a difference in the size of the olfactory bulbs.</p>
        <p>One reason, Dr. Trojanowski said, may  be that early researchers saw no particular reason to pay attention.</p>
        <p>''If you look at how the bulbs sit in the skull when you take out the brain, it's easy to leave them behind,'' Dr. Trojanowski said.</p>
