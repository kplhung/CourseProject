        <p>Flying Turns</p>
        <p>Q. How do birds turn in flight? They bank just like planes, but their tails appear to offer no vertical rudder surface.</p>
        <p>A. The assumption that a bird's tail functions only as a horizontal surface is erroneous, said Ron Rohrbaugh, an ornithologist at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology in Ithaca, N.Y.</p>
        <p>''The tail does function as a rudder,'' he said. ''A bird can twist its tail laterally, from left to right, and downward, so it acts almost as a braking system that allows it to bank into turns.''</p>
        <p>Some birds are better at this than others, he continued. ''For example,'' he said, ''some hawks in the group known as accipiters, which spend most of the time in forested settings, use their tails as rudders so they can rapidly weave their way through trees without striking them.''</p>
        <p>There are other turning mechanisms as well. ''Some birds, like waterfowl, that have large webbed feet can use their feet to steer during landing,'' Mr. Rohrbaugh said. ''The feet have a lot of surface area, which creates wind resistance, and can be used much the way other birds might use their tails to steer.''</p>
        <p>Birds also steer by changing their wing configuration. ''They can change the angle of attack, which is simply the angle at which the wing intersects the stream of air,'' Mr. Rohrbaugh said. ''A greater angle of attack creates more wind resistance, and applying this differentially on each wing allows the bird to turn.''</p>
