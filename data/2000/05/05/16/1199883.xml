        <p>PITY the short-sellers. Practically driven to extinction by a bull market run, they should be reveling now that many of the stocks they long considered overvalued have fallen sharply. But many of them have been left out of this market move, too.</p>
        <p>The meteoric rise of technology stocks over the last few years forced many short-sellers to abandon positions, shut their operations or liquidate their portfolios and go into cash. So when the technology sector and the market over all finally had a bracing retreat in April, some of the investment funds that have specialized in selling stocks short, or betting that stock prices will drop, were not positioned to profit.</p>
        <p>''It was only a few months ago when you'd listen to CNBC and people would be saying proudly that they paid no attention to valuation; the climate was crazy,'' one prominent short-fund manager said. ''I know of many good managers with good experience who folded. They quit because the pain became so intense.''</p>
        <p>The esteemed money manager Julian H. Robertson Jr. summed it up when he announced he was closing his hedge fund empire earlier this year: ''We are in a market where reason does not prevail.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps nothing has been as vexing as technology. Many highflying stocks, including PMC-Sierra, MicroStrategy and Echelon, soared in February and March only to plummet in April. As the stocks soared, short-sellers began unwinding their positions because of mounting losses. By the time the stock of MicroStrategy, a Virginia software company, fell precipitously on reports of accounting problems, the shorts had largely given up. Its short interest declined to 724,630 shares in mid-March from 3.8 million shares in mid-December. The stock peaked in March and then fell 94 percent to its April trough.</p>
        <p>''If you were going to be a short-seller that survived, you didn't do it by shorting tech,'' said James T. Gillies, chief information officer of Hedgefund.net, which tracks industry data. ''You survived by shorting old-line companies, companies with earnings problems. If you had tried to short tech, you would've gotten creamed.''</p>
        <p>Short funds did perform markedly better in April, but their overall performance for the year remains undistinguished. There are about 10 short-sellers remaining among the ranks of hedge funds, the exclusive investment funds that cater to wealthy individuals and institutional investors.</p>
        <p>According to three companies that track the unregulated hedge fund industry, at least as many short funds are down as are up this year. (Data from a fourth company, the Hennessee Group, a hedge fund consultant, shows that four short funds have declined, while six have risen.)</p>
        <p>One thing the trackers agree on is that short funds have dwindled to a tiny slice of the hedge fund industry, which is believed to have more than $300 billion in assets. Short-oriented funds are said to account for less than $1 billion of that total.</p>
        <p>''The ones that stayed in business, some of them were afraid of shorting some of the stocks that had gone up tenfold,'' said Tyler M. Garratt, vice president of Skye Advisors, a Los Gatos, Calif., firm. Skye manages BearGuard, a $1.5 million fund that was transformed from a hedge fund into a short-selling mutual fund last year.</p>
        <p>''I think they got scared of shorting what they knew in their heart was overvalued,'' Mr. Garratt said. ''The only stocks that went down were value stocks, so they switched. Then they got hurt this year because those held up and the tech stocks have been hurt.''</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index lost 2 percent in the first four months of the year, while the Nasdaq composite declined 6 percent and the Dow Jones Internet index fell 26 percent.</p>
        <p>The mixed performance for the short funds is disappointing for an investing group in dire need of a respite. The notion of investing in a short fund might sound pessimistic in a nation smitten with the growth of stocks, but the industry often describes buying a short fund as similar to buying fire insurance for a stock portfolio.</p>
        <p>''We've seen, over the last four years, 5 to 10 managers close their funds a year,'' says Barry H. Colvin of the hedge fund consulting firm Tremont Advisors. Harry A. Strunk, who tracks short funds for the brokerage firm of Morgan, Keegan, thinks the shorts peaked in 1991, when there were about 25 pure short funds managing some $2 billion. But ''the 90's were pretty dismal,'' Mr. Strunk said. The group fell an average of 4.4 percent a year during the decade.</p>
        <p>Noted shorts like the Feshbach brothers of Palo Alto, Calif., who once managed as much as $1 billion, abandoned their short strategy by 1994. At the end of last year, Alan Fenster, a prominent short who ran the San Francisco-based Brookline Capital, closed up shop.</p>
        <p>The most prominent names remaining include two New York firms: Rocker Partners, which manages over $500 million, and Kynikos Associates. Someone close to its manager, Jim Chanos, says Kynikos' $350 million Ursus Fund is up 10 percent this year.</p>
        <p>''I think that what happened to a lot of short-sellers is that, in '99, they saw things they thought wouldn't go up anymore, but they did,'' Mr. Garratt of Skye Advisors said. ''They thought they couldn't be wrong so many times in row.''</p>
