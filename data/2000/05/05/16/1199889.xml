        <p>Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's decision today declaring unconstitutional the civil remedy provision of the Violence Against Women Act, referred to by the court as Section 13981. The vote, in United States v. Morrison, was 5 to 4. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, and Justice David H. Souter wrote the dissent.</p>
        <p>FROM THE DECISION  By Chief Justice Rehnquist</p>
        <p>Section 13981 was part of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. It states that ''all persons within the United States shall have the right to be free from crimes of violence motivated by gender.'' To enforce that right, subsection (c) declares: ''person (including a person who acts under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any state) who commits a crime of violence motivated by gender and thus deprives another of the right declared in subsection (b) of this section shall be liable to the party injured, in an action for the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and such other relief as a court may deem appropriate.'' . . .</p>
        <p>Congress explicitly identified the sources of federal authority on which it relied in enacting Section 13981. It said that a ''federal civil rights cause of action'' is established ''pursuant to the affirmative power of Congress under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, as well as under Section 8 of Article I of the Constitution.'' We address Congress's authority to enact this remedy under each of these constitutional provisions in turn. . . .</p>
        <p>As we discussed at length in [United States v.] Lopez, our interpretation of the Commerce Clause has changed as our nation has developed. We need not repeat that detailed review of the Commerce Clause's history here; it suffices to say that, in the years since N.L.R.B. v. Jones Laughlin Steel Corporation, Congress has had considerably greater latitude in regulating conduct and transactions under the Commerce Clause than our previous case law permitted.</p>
        <p>Lopez emphasized, however, that even under our modern, expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause, Congress's regulatory authority is not without effective bounds.</p>
        <p>As we observed in Lopez, modern Commerce Clause jurisprudence has ''identified three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power. First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce. Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities. Finally, Congress's commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, i.e., those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.'' . . .</p>
        <p>Several significant considerations contributed to our decision [in Lopez].</p>
        <p>First, we observed that Section 922(q) [of the Gun-Free School Zones Act] was ''a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with 'commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms.'' . . . Lopez's review of Commerce Clause case law demonstrates that in those cases where we have sustained federal regulation of intrastate activity based upon the activity's substantial effects on interstate commerce, the activity in question has been some sort of economic endeavor.</p>
        <p>The second consideration that we found important in analyzing Section 922(q) was that the statute contained ''no express jurisdictional element which might limit its reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally have an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce.'' Such a jurisdictional element may establish that the enactment is in pursuance of Congress's regulation of interstate commerce.</p>
        <p>Third, we noted that neither Section 922(q) ''nor its legislative history contains express Congressional findings regarding the effects upon interstate commerce of gun possession in a school zone.'' . . .</p>
        <p>Finally, our decision in Lopez rested in part on the fact that the link between gun possession and a substantial effect on interstate commerce was attenuated. . . .</p>
        <p>With these principles underlying our Commerce Clause jurisprudence as reference points, the proper resolution of the present cases is clear. Gender-motivated crimes of violence are not, in any sense of the phrase, economic activity. While we need not adopt a categorical rule against aggregating the effects of any noneconomic activity in order to decide these cases, thus far in our nation's history our cases have upheld Commerce Clause regulation of intrastate activity only where that activity is economic in nature.</p>
        <p>Like the Gun-Free School Zones Act at issue in Lopez, Section 13981 contains no jurisdictional element establishing that the federal cause of action is in pursuance of Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. . . .</p>
        <p>In contrast with the lack of Congressional findings that we faced in Lopez, Section 13981 is supported by numerous findings regarding the serious impact that gender-motivated violence has on victims and their families. But the existence of Congressional findings is not sufficient, by itself, to sustain the constitutionality of Commerce Clause legislation.</p>
        <p>In these cases, Congress's findings are substantially weakened by the fact that they rely so heavily on a method of reasoning that we have already rejected as unworkable if we are to maintain the Constitution's enumeration of powers. Congress found that gender-motivated violence affects interstate commerce ''by deterring potential victims from traveling interstate, from engaging in employment in interstate business, and from transacting with business, and in places involved in interstate commerce; by diminishing national productivity, increasing medical and other costs, and decreasing the supply of and the demand for interstate products.''</p>
        <p>Given these findings and petitioners' arguments, the concern that we expressed in Lopez that Congress might use the Commerce Clause to completely obliterate the Constitution's distinction between national and local authority seems well founded. The reasoning that petitioners advance seeks to follow the but-for causal chain from the initial occurrence of violent crime (the suppression of which has always been the prime object of the States' police power) to every attenuated effect upon interstate commerce. If accepted, petitioners' reasoning would allow Congress to regulate any crime as long as the nationwide, aggregated impact of that crime has substantial effects on employment, production, transit, or consumption. Indeed, if Congress may regulate gender-motivated violence, it would be able to regulate murder or any other type of violence since gender-motivated violence, as a subset of all violent crime, is certain to have lesser economic impacts than the larger class of which it is a part.</p>
        <p>Petitioners' reasoning, moreover, will not limit Congress to regulating violence but may, as we suggested in Lopez, be applied equally as well to family law and other areas of traditional state regulation since the aggregate effect of marriage, divorce, and childrearing on the national economy is undoubtedly significant. Congress may have recognized this specter when it expressly precluded Section 13981 from being used in the family law context. Under our written Constitution, however, the limitation of Congressional authority is not solely a matter of legislative grace.</p>
        <p>We accordingly reject the argument that Congress may regulate noneconomic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that conduct's aggregate effect on interstate commerce. The Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local. In recognizing this fact we preserve one of the few principles that has been consistent since the Clause was adopted. The regulation and punishment of intrastate violence that is not directed at the instrumentalities, channels, or goods involved in interstate commerce has always been the province of the States. Indeed, we can think of no better example of the police power, which the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States, than the suppression of violent crime and vindication of its victims.</p>
        <p>Because we conclude that the Commerce Clause does not provide Congress with authority to enact Section 13981, we address petitioners' alternative argument that the section's civil remedy should be upheld as an exercise of Congress's remedial power under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment. . . .</p>
        <p>Section 5 states that Congress may enforce, by appropriate legislation, the constitutional guarantee that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law, nor deny any person equal protection of the laws. . . .</p>
        <p>Petitioners' Section 5 argument is founded on an assertion that there is pervasive bias in various state justice systems against victims of gender-motivated violence. This assertion is supported by a voluminous Congressional record. . . . Petitioners contend that this bias denies victims of gender-motivated violence the equal protection of the laws and that Congress therefore acted appropriately in enacting a private civil remedy against the perpetrators of gender-motivated violence to both remedy the states' bias and deter future instances of discrimination in the state courts.</p>
        <p>As our cases have established, state-sponsored gender discrimination violates equal protection unless it serves important governmental objectives and the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.  However, the language and purpose of the 14th Amendment place certain limitations on the manner in which Congress may attack discriminatory conduct. These limitations are necessary to prevent the 14th Amendment from obliterating the framers' carefully crafted balance of power between the states and the national government. Foremost among these limitations is the time-honored principle that the 14th Amendment, by its very terms, prohibits only state action. . . .  Section 13981 . . . is directed not at any state or state actor, but at individuals.</p>
        <p>FROM THE DISSENT  By Justice Souter</p>
        <p>The court says both that it leaves Commerce Clause precedent undisturbed and that the Civil Rights Remedy of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 . . . exceeds Congress's power under that Clause. I find the claims irreconcilable and respectfully dissent.</p>
        <p>Our cases, which remain at least nominally undisturbed, stand for the following propositions. Congress has the power to legislate with regard to activity that, in the aggregate, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The fact of such a substantial effect is not an issue for the courts in the first instance, but for the Congress, whose institutional capacity for gathering evidence and taking testimony far exceeds ours. By passing legislation, Congress indicates its conclusion, whether explicitly or not, that facts support its exercise of the commerce power. The business of the courts is to review the Congressional assessment, not for soundness but simply for the rationality of concluding that a jurisdictional basis exists in fact. Any explicit findings that Congress chooses to make, though not dispositive of the question of rationality, may advance judicial review by identifying factual authority on which Congress relied.  Applying those propositions in these cases can lead to only one conclusion.</p>
        <p>One obvious difference from United States v. Lopez is the mountain of data assembled by Congress, here showing the effects of violence against women on interstate commerce. Passage of the Act in 1994 was preceded by four years of hearings, which included testimony from physicians and law professors; from survivors of rape and domestic violence; and from representatives of state law enforcement and private business. The record includes reports on gender bias from task forces in 21 states, and we have the benefit of specific factual findings in the eight separate reports issued by Congress and its committees over the long course leading to enactment. Congress thereby explicitly stated the predicate for the exercise of its Commerce Clause power.  Is its conclusion irrational in view of the data amassed? True, the methodology of particular studies may be challenged, and some of the figures arrived at may be disputed. But the sufficiency of the evidence before Congress to provide a rational basis for the finding cannot seriously be questioned.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the legislative record here is far more voluminous than the record compiled by Congress and found sufficient in two prior cases upholding Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against Commerce Clause challenges. While Congress did not, to my knowledge, calculate aggregate dollar values for the nationwide effects of racial discrimination in 1964, in 1994 it did rely on evidence of the harms caused by domestic violence and sexual assault, citing annual costs of $3 billion in 1990, and $5 to $10 billion in 1993. Equally important, though, gender-based violence in the 1990's was shown to operate in a manner similar to racial discrimination in the 1960's in reducing the mobility of employees and their production and consumption of goods shipped in interstate commerce. Like racial discrimination, ''gender-based violence bars its most likely targets -- women -- from full participation in the national economy.'' . . .</p>
        <p>The [Violence Against Women] Act would have passed muster at any time between  Wickard [v. Filburn] in 1942 and Lopez in 1995, a period in which the law enjoyed a stable understanding that Congressional power under the Commerce Clause, complemented by the authority of the Necessary and Proper Clause, extended to all activity that, when aggregated, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. As already noted, this understanding was secure even against the turmoil at the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in the aftermath of which the court not only reaffirmed the cumulative effects and rational basis features of the substantial effects test . . . but declined to limit the commerce power through a formal distinction between legislation focused on ''commerce''and statutes addressing ''moral and social wrongs.''</p>
        <p>The fact that the act does not pass muster before the court today is therefore proof, to a degree that Lopez was not, that the court's nominal adherence to the substantial effects test is merely that. Although a new jurisprudence has not emerged with any distinctness, it is clear that some Congressional conclusions about obviously substantial, cumulative effects on commerce are being assigned lesser values than the once-stable doctrine would assign them. These devaluations are accomplished not by any express repudiation of the substantial effects test or its application through the aggregation of individual conduct, but by supplanting rational basis scrutiny with a new criterion of review.</p>
        <p>Thus the elusive heart of the majority's analysis in these cases is its statement that Congress's findings of fact are ''weakened'' by the presence of a disfavored ''method of reasoning.'' This seems to suggest that the ''substantial effects'' analysis is not a factual enquiry for Congress in the first instance with subsequent judicial review looking only to the rationality of the Congressional conclusion, but one of a rather different sort, dependent upon a uniquely judicial competence.</p>
