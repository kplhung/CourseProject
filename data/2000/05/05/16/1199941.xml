        <p>After a seven-week investigation that concluded that Bob Knight had displayed a ''pattern of inappropriate behavior'' that had embarrassed Indiana University, the university's president said today that the longtime Hoosier basketball coach deserved a ''last chance'' and would be allowed to continue as coach.</p>
        <p>The president, Myles Brand, said that Knight would be suspended for three games next season and fined $30,000. He also said Knight would serve as coach under a ''zero tolerance'' policy that would be stringently enforced. Brand  threatened to dismiss Knight if he has inappropriate physical contact with players or other people at the university or if he does not conduct himself with ''decorum and civility'' on occasions when he is representing Indiana, such as on the bench and in news conferences.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>After a seven-week investigation that concluded that Bob Knight had displayed a ''pattern of inappropriate behavior'' that had embarrassed Indiana University, the university's president said today that the longtime Hoosier basketball coach deserved a ''last chance'' and would be allowed to continue as coach.</p>
        <p>The president, Myles Brand, said that Knight would be suspended for three games next season and fined $30,000. He also said Knight would serve as coach under a ''zero tolerance'' policy that would be stringently enforced. Brand  threatened to dismiss Knight if he has inappropriate physical contact with players or other people at the university or if he does not conduct himself with ''decorum and civility'' on occasions when he is representing Indiana, such as on the bench and in news conferences.</p>
        <p>Brand, along with the two university trustees who conducted the investigation, conceded they were troubled by what Brand called ''persistent and systematic'' abusive behavior by Knight, a Hall of Fame coach who has brought Indiana three national titles in his 29 years as an icon in a basketball-crazy state.</p>
        <p>The investigation concluded specifically that Knight had grabbed Neil Reed, a player who later left Indiana, on the neck for 2.3 seconds; had intimidated a 64-year-old secretary in the athletic department with foul language and a thrown vase; and had gotten into abusive arguments and physical altercations with colleagues and subordinates. Still, Brand, who made the decision, said there was ''no incident by itself that rose to the level of termination.''</p>
        <p>''I think the ethical approach is to give him one last chance,'' Brand said at a news conference. ''He has given me his word that he will take extraordinary steps to change behavior.</p>
        <p>''We have established tough, specific guidelines to send a clear message that abusive and embarrassing behavior will not be tolerated.''</p>
        <p>Knight did not attend the news conference. John Walda, one of the trustees who led the investigation, read a statement by Knight in which he said he had ''absolutely no problem with the guidelines.''</p>
        <p>''The establishment of effective and proper guidelines can in the long run help me become a better coach,'' the statement said. ''As I have said before, I recognize that I have a problem with my temper. For those times it has ever caused me to do anything that gave anyone understandable and justifiable reason to be upset, I am sincerely sorry.''</p>
        <p>Brand said Knight would apologize to Jeanette Hartgraves, the university secretary whom Knight bullied by throwing a vase in her office in 1988. But Brand said the general apology would suffice for those involved in the other incidents. There were several accusations:</p>
        <p>*That in the mid-1970's Knight choked and punched Kit Klingelhoffer, then the assistant sports information director.</p>
        <p>*That late last year Knight accosted Ron Felling, then his assistant coach.</p>
        <p>*That this year Knight upbraided his boss, Athletic Director Clarence Doninger, in a near altercation.</p>
        <p>*That in 1997 Knight choked Reed at a practice, the allegation that spurred the overall inquiry.</p>
        <p>Walda said the Reed incident, which was caught on videotape, was ''clearly inappropriate,'' but he stopped short of characterizing it as a choking action and pointed out that the player was not injured. ''We are resolved that if Coach Knight persists in this type of contact, it will not be tolerated,'' Walda said.</p>
        <p>In the course of the investigation, he said, 29 people were interviewed, including 12 athletic department employees and 7 former players.</p>
        <p>Walda said Reed's charge that Knight had brandished soiled toilet paper to motivate his team had ''little credibility.'' He also dismissed Reed's allegation that Brand was banished by Knight from a Hoosier practice.</p>
        <p>On the eve of Sunday's trustees' meeting, where the inquiry findings were given to eight of the nine trustees, Knight issued a statement acknowledging that his temper had led him into confrontations and promising to work harder at developing a more diplomatic approach. He also made it clear he wanted to keep his job.</p>
        <p>But Brand acknowledged that it was a two-hour meeting with the coach at the president's home on Saturday night that had brought about his decision not to fire him.</p>
        <p>''The conversation I had with Bob was clearly unique,'' Brand said. ''I had never seen him before contrite and apologetic. As the discussion proceeded and Bob expressed the view that he very much wanted to change his behavior, then we began to talk about sanctions.''</p>
        <p>Brand came to Knight's defense in 1998 when the coach's support seemed to be eroding after a history of boorish behavior and, by Indiana standards, subpar seasons. Brand and Walda wrote a letter citing Knight's average of 23 victories a season, a 77 percent graduation rate -- nearly double the national average for college basketball -- and the fact the program has never run afoul of the National Collegiate Athletic Association under Knight's reign.</p>
        <p>He cited the same factors today and expressed confidence that the volatile coach could live up to the tough, new guidelines set before him. ''He will give it as good a try as he can,'' Brand said. ''He has a good chance to pull it off.''</p>
        <p>Brand named Doninger, the athletic director, to head a new commission to come up with a code of conduct for all university coaches. Doninger, who was displeased by being given no role in the inquiry, said he was not sure he would even remain as athletic director.</p>
        <p>In light of their recent clashes, he was asked if he could get along with Knight.</p>
        <p>''I always said I could get along with anybody,'' Doninger said. ''With the guidelines, I think I can get along with Coach.''</p>
        <p>Dave Pisoni, a chancellors' professor of psychology and cognitive science, said Brand and the trustees had gotten what they wanted -- Knight's retention -- but had sent a regrettable message.</p>
        <p>''It displays the lack of principled leadership that we have at the university,'' Pisoni said. ''You really didn't think they were going to fire Bobby Knight. Our image is not tarnished, but irreparably damaged. It sends the message that athletics are more important than academics, that marketing and revenues streams mean more than scholarship.''</p>
        <p>One current player, Dane Fife, suggested there was only one way for Knight to quell the debate. ''I'm pretty sure if we won a lot of games and won a national championship,'' he said, ''it would cure all of this.''</p>
