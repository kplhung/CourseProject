        <p>Although it has been a dream series for Charlie Ward, whose productivity has earned him crowd chants usually reserved for deadly jump shooters, the other half of the Knicks' two-headed point-guard attack has struggled. Plagued by fouls, Chris Childs has been reduced to living vicariously through Ward.</p>
        <p>After playing nearly 24 minutes a game during the regular season, Childs has averaged only 15 minutes and totaled 8 points and 5 assists over the last three games. With 12 fouls, he has averaged a foul every 3.8 minutes.</p>
        <p>''I'm not able to play with the foul trouble,'' Childs said. ''They're making calls I don't agree with. But there's nothing I can do, just the best I can when I'm out there.''</p>
        <p>After being called for one foul in 26 minutes of Game 1, he fouled out in 11 minutes in Game 2. After his sixth foul, Childs went on a tirade, forcing his teammates to push him toward the bench to calm him down. Furious, Childs charged into the locker room rather than sit on the bench for the final seven minutes of the game.</p>
        <p>Since then, Childs has not gotten the benefit of any calls from the referees. Contact that may not be called on other players is a foul when Childs is involved. Don Chaney, a Knicks assistant coach, said Childs's predicament is because of his penchant for complaining to officials whenever he is called for a foul.</p>
        <p>''He doesn't have a great relationship with the referees,'' Chaney said. ''I was a defender, I know. You've got to establish a good relationship with the referees. You can't overreact to calls, whether they're right or wrong. I've been talking to him about that for years, since he's been here. But it's part of his nature and it's something that he has to control. They're not giving him that respect because they figure he complains all the time.''</p>
        <p>Childs cites the physical play that Miami's Dan Majerle uses guarding Allan Houston. Strong, burly and a step slow, Majerle constantly bumps Houston and is rarely called for a foul.</p>
        <p>''I see the way he grabs and gets away with a lot, how he plays Allan with his forearms,'' Childs said. ''I mean, if I have to sit and watch that, I want to punch the TV, knowing he's doing more than I'm doing and getting away with it.''</p>
        <p>Ward Gets No Respect</p>
        <p>Miami point guard Anthony Carter, who was guarding Charlie Ward when Ward scored the final 9 points in the Knicks' 91-83 victory on Sunday, refused to credit the Knick guard for having a great game, saying, ''I thought it was garbage points at the end of the game.''</p>
        <p>After yesterday's practice, some of the Knicks responded unkindly to Carter's opinion.</p>
        <p>''He can think whatever he wants to think,'' Patrick Ewing said. ''If Charlie didn't make those baskets at the end, it would be a lot closer game. I thought Charlie played a fantastic game. You can't take anything away from that.''</p>
        <p>''It's always been like that,'' Chris Childs said. ''He said it was garbage points, but I don't see how. We were up 2 when Charlie made all the big plays. And it was all against him. He was guarding him, so what's it say about his defense?'' Actually, the Knicks were up by 5 points when Ward started his scoring binge.</p>
        <p>Ward responded humbly and philosophically to the slight.</p>
        <p>''I used up all I had that day, and now the stats and everything are thrown out,'' he said. ''After the game on Wednesday, if they want to say it's garbage and we win, I'll take that garbage and keep throwing it out so the trash man can get it the next day.''</p>
        <p>Knicks Need Rebounding Help</p>
        <p>Either team rebounding is overrated or the Knicks should feel fortunate to be tied at two victories apiece. The Knicks have been outrebounded in every game of the series. Miami has 184 rebounds in the four games and the Knicks have 154.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, guard Dan Majerle had 12 rebounds, more than any Knick. Coach Jeff Van Gundy would like to see his guards crash the boards in similar fashion to help the Knicks close the gap.</p>
        <p>The Knicks have only had two players reach double figures in rebounding this series. Marcus Camby had 13 in Game 1 and Patrick Ewing had 11 in Game 4. Oddly, the Knicks had 166 rebounds to Miami's 163 in the four regular-season meetings and beat the heat on the boards in two of the games.</p>
