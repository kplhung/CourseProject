        <p>Gracie Mansion Issues an Invitation</p>
        <p>Have the party planners at City Hall not been reading the papers? The invitation to the annual ''Salute to the Theater'' at Gracie Mansion began the way invitations to official events at Gracie Mansion have always begun, with two names followed by the words ''cordially invite you to join them.'' The two names were RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI and DONNA HANOVER, ''broadcast journalist and first lady of the City of New York.''</p>
        <p>In case the invitation writers missed it, last week the mayor said he wanted a separation from Ms. Hanover. The week before, the mayor said that a woman who had dined with him in Upper East Side restaurants and marched with him in the St. Patrick's Day parade was a ''very good friend.''</p>
        <p>But maybe the invitation senders know all that.</p>
        <p>''All invitations at Gracie Mansion have Donna's name on them because she lives at Gracie Mansion,'' Ms. Hanover's spokeswoman, JOANNIE DANIELIDES, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>So will Ms. Hanover appear at the theater salute on Monday? ''It's on her schedule,'' Ms. Danielides said. ''I don't know if she'll be attending.'' The mayor's press office said that as of yesterday, the event was still on his schedule, too.</p>
        <p>Film Recalls Mapplethorpe Case</p>
        <p>Next week, anyone with Showtime can watch ''Dirty Pictures.'' The other night, one had to be an invited guest.</p>
        <p>Showtime and the Creative Coalition, a nonprofit advocacy group representing the arts and entertainment fields, rented the Beekman Theater on the Upper East Side for a screening. The audience saw a film about the 1990 scandal that began when Dennis Barrie, a Cincinnati museum director -- played in the film by JAMES WOODS -- agreed to exhibit homoerotic and sadomasochistic photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe. Mr. Barrie was put on trial and charged with pandering obscenity.</p>
        <p>Those who like their made-for-cable films to contain surprises need read no further: Mr. Barrie was acquitted. Those who like their made-for-cable films to feature talking heads will find SALMAN RUSHDIE, WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY JR., REPRESENTATIVE BARNEY FRANK, FRAN LEBOWITZ and SUSAN SARANDON, who explained why she had let her daughter pose for Mapplethorpe.</p>
        <p>Following the screening, busloads of First Amendment-friendly guests went to the Whitney Museum for a reception. One lawyer in the crowd was LEON FRIEDMAN, who, incidentally, once defended Hurricane Carter and was portrayed by Harris Yulin in the recent film ''Hurricane.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Friedman noted that many in the crowd had been involved in the ''Sensation'' case involving the Brooklyn Museum last year. ''But we don't think there's a movie in the Brooklyn case,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He was hardly the only lawyer there. FLOYD ABRAMS was in attendence, as were ARTHUR EISENBERG, MARILYN HAFT and HENRY SCHLEIFF, the president of Court TV. Some nonlawyers were on hand, too, including GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS and BILLY BALDWIN, the president of the Creative Coalition.</p>
        <p>''This movie is so exciting for us,'' said ROBIN BRONK, the executive director. ''It's what we're about.''</p>
        <p>Seven Honored For Design Work</p>
        <p>ALBERT HADLEY, the interior designer, stood at the bar with his bushy eyebrows and cunning sense of celebrity, smiling like a little fox. ''At five feet something, I never thought of myself as a giant,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But House Beautiful magazine did. He was one of seven ''Giants of Design'' honored at the Rainbow Room the other night.</p>
        <p>With an electronic billboard of flat-screen monitors projecting the glow of lifetime-achievement videos, the evening looked more like a night at home, with dinner in front of the television set in a big living room with a big chandelier, complete with commercials from sponsors. Outside the building's 64th-floor windows, helicopters hovered like the summer's first bugs.</p>
        <p>MICHAEL GRAVES, architect, Washington Monument remodeler and Target Stores appliance designer, drew a laugh from the crowd when he promoted his new Target travel clock at the start of his acceptance speech. He won for product design.</p>
        <p>ROBERT VENTURI, in slightly disheveled, slightly less-than-white black tie, and his wife, DENISE SCOTT BROWN, won for architecture. ''Some people think we're great,'' Mr. Venturi said. ''Some people think we're lousy. It's great to be 75 and controversial.''</p>
        <p>DAVID YURMAN, a jeweler, introduced MURRAY MOSS, who won for creative retailing. Mr. Yurman explained that Mr. Moss could frequently be found removing clients'  noseprints from the museumlike display cases at his store in SoHo with Windex. Mr. Moss, ever the design arbiter, corrected him.</p>
        <p>''It's Glass Plus, not Windex,'' he told the $500-a-plate audience. ''Windex streaks.''</p>
