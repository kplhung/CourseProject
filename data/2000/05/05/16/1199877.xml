      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has elected every president since 1929 and dominated Mexican political life, is falling behind in the presidential race and is suddenly on the defensive.</p>
        <p>The trouble started for the party's candidate, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, when polls showed that he had been outperformed by an opposition rival, Vicente Fox Quesada, in the first televised presidential debate, on April 25.</p>
        <p>Right afterward, Mr. Labastida deepened his followers' anxiety with his reply to a college student who asked if he could lose the election on July 2. He said he might.</p>
        <p>Last Thursday, an opinion poll commissioned by Reuters showed for the first time that Mr. Fox had pulled ahead of Mr. Labastida, 46.3 percent to 41.6 percent, with a 3.2-point margin of error.</p>
        <p>The surge of Mr. Fox has rattled the governing party, known by its acronym in Spanish, PRI, as never before in a presidential contest.</p>
        <p>''It is the fourth quarter, and the scoreboard is against the PRI,'' said Jorge Chabat, a political analyst. ''They've never played the game like this. They don't know what to do.''</p>
        <p>After the debate, Mr. Labastida, acknowledging that his campaign was hobbled with ''too much analysis and not enough action,'' rushed to change its strategy and its staff.</p>
        <p>He stopped emphasizing that he represented a new incarnation of the governing party, which he called the New PRI to distinguish it from an old party notorious for corruption and economic mismanagement. Now, Mr. Labastida has closed ranks with the old PRI and conspicuously embraced its leaders, betting that he can win by mobilizing the full powers of the party's vast political machine.</p>
        <p>''Panic in the PRI!'' read the cover of the weekly newsmagazine Proceso.</p>
        <p>The PRI has faced serious presidential challengers before. Many Mexicans believe that Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, a leftist politician, won the election in 1988 but was squeezed out when PRI officials altered the tally in their favor.</p>
        <p>But this year is different, because an independent election agency is overseeing the vote and reforms have substantially leveled the field. If Mr. Fox wins, he has a good chance of claiming the victory.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox, 57, the candidate of the center-right National Action Party, is running a campaign with flashy commercials and choreographed antics that keep him in the limelight. He has a cowboy bravado that some Mexicans like, and he has turned his pungent country-style language on Mr. Labastida, calling him a ''shorty'' and a ''wimp.''</p>
        <p>On a recent whirl through the big-vote state of Veracruz, Mr. Labastida seemed cooler than his campaign's outward appearance suggested. In an interview aboard the campaign jet, Mr. Labastida said he was confident that the PRI's far-reaching house-to-house voter networks, unmatched by any other party, would ultimately deliver the vote.</p>
        <p>''We are strengthening the presence of our militant members while taking the party closer to the people,'' Mr. Labastida said of the turnabout in his campaign.</p>
        <p>The Veracruz tour showed that the PRI's problem is not its candidate. Although Mr. Labastida, a former interior minister, started the race with a reputation as a colorless bureaucrat, on the road he proved to be a vigorous and spirited campaigner.</p>
        <p>At two Veracruz rallies, Mr. Labastida ignored humidity that made even his eyelids sweat and rushed into the crowd to receive hot bear hugs and kisses from his followers.</p>
        <p>Although a PRI presidential candidate was assassinated in 1994, Mr. Labastida prefers minimal security by plainclothes guards he routinely leaves behind. He insists on driving, even on the campaign trail, and at one point brought his convoy of six vans to a tire-burning halt to allow a family of pedestrians to cross a city street. They and everyone else on the block gaped in amazement at the uncommon show of courtesy from a man of power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Labastida has a knack for connecting with voters. A 37-year-old single mother named Ana fought her way to him and tearfully recounted that she had lost a job because employers had said she was too old.</p>
        <p>The candidate, who is 57, comforted her, talking all the while about his equal employment proposals. In a speech to PRI members that evening, he tossed away a prepared text to give an emotional replay of the encounter.</p>
        <p>If anything, the candidate's problem is his party's record. Although the economy has recovered, Mexicans have not forgotten the currency collapse of 1994 or the PRI graft scandals that keep coming to light. But many Mexicans also value the continuity of seven decades of PRI rule and depend on the welfare state the party built.</p>
        <p>Banking on that tradition, Mr. Labastida decided to fix his campaign by clipping the wings of its reformist manager, Esteban Moctezuma, who forged the concept of the New PRI.</p>
        <p>Instead the candidate reinstated some of the party's hoariest figures, known as dinosaurs, whom Mr. Moctezuma had left on the sidelines. Oddly enough, the shift came only days after Mr. Labastida, in the televised debate, had taunted Mr. Fox by saying, ''You remind me of the old PRI.''</p>
        <p>''Ours is an inclusive party,'' Mr. Labastida said in an effort to explain the contradiction. He said he had reached out to those party veterans who accepted the once rigidly authoritarian party's new, more democratic rules of play.</p>
        <p>First Mr. Labastida was photographed at a PRI luncheon with Carlos Hank Gonzalez, a former mayor of Mexico City who became a multimillionaire during his political career. Last fall, when Mr. Labastida was fighting for his party's nomination, he said he would not accept help from the Hank family.</p>
        <p>Another veteran party member Mr. Labastida named to his campaign was Manuel Bartlett. As interior minister in 1988, Mr. Bartlett is widely suspected of having rigged the presidential vote tally against Mr. Cardenas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Labastida dismissed the ''things that have been said about Manuel'' and praised Mr. Bartlett for siding with democratic change in the PRI by running in the party's first primary last November and accepting his loss to Mr. Labastida.</p>
        <p>''Manuel Bartlett has good relations with most people in the PRI,'' Mr. Labastida said, and added, ''He will not have anything to do with overseeing the elections.''</p>
        <p>The old guard came back in a rush that slipped out of Mr. Labastida's control.</p>
        <p>PRI leaders named Manlio Fabio Beltrones to help run the party's legislative campaigns. In 1997, when Mr. Beltrones was governor of Sonora, United States Drug Enforcement Administration documents cited him as having ties to drug trafficking.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beltrones vehemently denied a report about the documents in The New York Times and moved to sue for criminal libel. The Mexican attorney general declined to press charges, noting differences between freedom of expression laws in Mexico and the United States, where the report was published. As governor Mr. Beltrones was popular in his state, but he has not held public office since he stepped down in 1997.</p>
        <p>Mr. Labastida was taken by surprise when asked about Mr. Beltrones's appointment a day after it was announced. ''I'm sorry, but I haven't seen anything about that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The campaign is already picking up steam. James Carville, President Clinton's political consultant, has been advising Mr. Labastida on how to be more media savvy. Now the candidate is running communications himself. Hours after the Reuters poll was announced, Mr. Labastida's team assailed its reliability, announcing a survey by a pollster hired directly by the PRI, Stanley Greenberg. It showed Mr. Labastida in the lead with 40 percent and Mr. Fox with 36 percent.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the PRI has rolled out some of its well-worn hardball tactics. According to an audio tape obtained by the opposition, hours after the presidential debate, the PRI governor of Chiapas, Roberto Albores Guillen, ordered his press staff to lean on local newspaper editors to publish stories trumpeting a victory for Mr. Labastida.</p>
        <p>To judge from the Chiapas headlines the next day, that is exactly what they did. Four papers, including the leading one, bannered headlines that read in one form or another that Mr. Labastida had triumphed.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Fox was on a tour in the state of Puebla, a leader of the oil workers' union there hung out the opposition candidate's white-and-blue banner at the local headquarters. Top bosses of the staunchly PRI union fired off letters ordering the local leader to take the banner down.</p>
        <p>''There is a massive operation to tighten down the screws,'' charged Luis Felipe Bravo Mena, the chairman of Mr. Fox's party.</p>
        <p>PRI supporters, while skeptical, said they were ready to answer the party's call. ''I'm going to vote for them once more,'' said Salvador Alejandre Martinez, a 30-year-old PRI follower at a rally in Veracruz. ''But believe me, if things don't change, this is the last time.''</p>
