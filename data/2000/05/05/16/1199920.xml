        <p>Supporters of the Devils might feel that the team opened the Eastern Conference finals on Sunday with an easy victory over the Flyers. But the players and Coach Larry Robinson saw the need for a great deal of improvement before Game 2 here on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>''Sure, we won, 4-1, but we didn't feel any security,'' the Devils' captain, Scott Stevens, said after today's practice at the First Union Center. ''We're not very happy with the way we played. We've got to play 60 minutes and do certain things right, and we didn't do it the last game.''</p>

        <p>Supporters of the Devils might feel that the team opened the Eastern Conference finals on Sunday with an easy victory over the Flyers. But the players and Coach Larry Robinson saw the need for a great deal of improvement before Game 2 here on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>''Sure, we won, 4-1, but we didn't feel any security,'' the Devils' captain, Scott Stevens, said after today's practice at the First Union Center. ''We're not very happy with the way we played. We've got to play 60 minutes and do certain things right, and we didn't do it the last game.''</p>
        <p>The Devils scored three times on 16 shots in the first period to take a 3-1 lead, but they took only four shots in each of the last two periods.</p>
        <p>Robinson, who spoke to his players at center ice during practice late this afternoon, appeared extremely unhappy with the Devils' play in the defensive zone. The coach said that he could tolerate the 36 shots the Flyers took, but that he was concerned about other things he saw on the game tape.</p>
        <p>''We gave Philly too much room to move the puck,'' Robinson said. ''We made it easy for them to bring it out of their zone. It was a funny game on our part. We played well at times and we didn't at other times. It was the way we were reacting in our zone. We have to play an all-around game.''</p>
        <p>Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur said the barrage of Flyers shots came from all angles.</p>
        <p>''They got a lot of good chances,'' he said after the game. As he often does on days between games during the playoffs, Brodeur did not make himself available to reporters today.</p>
        <p>The Devils said they expected the Flyers to be making some changes in strategy for Game 2. Most of them said the Flyers would probably pay more attention to defense because they played a wide-open first period in Game 1.</p>
        <p>''I've got an idea what they'll try to do,'' Robinson said without sharing the details.</p>
        <p>''We're different than Buffalo and Pittsburgh,'' he said, referring to the teams the Flyers eliminated in the first two rounds.</p>
        <p>Some Devils said the Flyers would be more physical for the rest of the series. Others said the Flyers would come out strong and attempt to take an early lead, the way the Devils did in the opener of the four-of-seven-game series.</p>
        <p>John Madden, the Devils' defensive specialist, said: ''When they're down by two, they know they need to score three. And a lot of teams know how difficult it is to do that against our team.''</p>
        <p>Defenseman Brian Rafalski, who has been paired with Stevens against the opponents' top players in the playoffs, said the Flyers would make the Devils work a lot harder.</p>
        <p>''We'll have to match their hard work and make smarter plays,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Both he and Stevens have been the Devils' best defensemen in the playoffs, and they are a major reason the team has nine victories and only two losses.</p>
        <p>The Devils swept the Florida Panthers in the first round and topped the Toronto Maple Leafs in the conference semifinals, 4-2.</p>
        <p>Robinson has the ability to preach calmness, and he never loses sight of the big picture.</p>
        <p>He apparently tells the right things to his players, too. Robinson said that taking his wife to the movies in the middle of the playoffs was a good way to get away from the game.</p>
        <p>''If you think 'hockey, hockey' in your mind all the time, it's not good,'' Robinson said. ''That's why I went to the movies to relax.''</p>
        <p>With six Stanley Cup rings from his days with the Montreal Canadiens, Robinson knows the little things necessary for success in the playoffs. He said today that it was important to avoid resting on your laurels after your last victory and hanging your head after your last loss.</p>
        <p>When Robinson and his players speak about room for improvement after a 4-1 victory on the road to take the home-ice advantage from the Flyers, the Devils have no intention of resting on their laurels.</p>
