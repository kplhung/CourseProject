        <p>Larry Otis Graham, an author who has drawn attention for his writings on race, announced his bid today to unseat Representative Sue W. Kelly, a Republican who has drawn attention recently for chastising one of her constituents, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham is seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Mrs. Kelly in the 19th Congressional District, which includes northern Westchester County, Putnam County and parts of Dutchess and Orange Counties -- but most notably for the news media, the village of Chappaqua in Westchester.

        <p>Larry Otis Graham, an author who has drawn attention for his writings on race, announced his bid today to unseat Representative Sue W. Kelly, a Republican who has drawn attention recently for chastising one of her constituents, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham is seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Mrs. Kelly in the 19th Congressional District, which includes northern Westchester County, Putnam County and parts of Dutchess and Orange Counties -- but most notably for the news media, the village of Chappaqua in Westchester. The president and Mrs. Clinton bought a house there last year in preparation for Mrs. Clinton's run for the Senate from New York, and their presence has already flavored the Congressional race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham, 39, lives in Chappaqua, not far from the Clintons' house. He has said that he received political pointers from the president, who is said to be playing a behind-the-scenes role in dozens of House and Senate races. Mr. Graham said he did not know whether either of the Clintons would campaign for him, though he added that he would welcome the help.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kelly, too, has sought to use the Clintons to her advantage. She attracted attention a few months ago with a flurry of attacks on Mrs. Clinton, whom she labeled a carpetbagger and a tax burden for traveling on government planes and running up overtime bills for local police departments helping to protect her.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kelly, 63, has a sizable campaign fund -- about $650,000, or nearly three times as much as Mr. Graham -- and the benefit of incumbency. After tough battles in her first two runs, she won her last race by 30 percentage points, and political handicappers believe her seat is secure.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, incumbents get dislodged when they are totally out of step with their district or if there is a personal scandal or something like that, and that does not seem the case with Kelly,'' said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute of Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie. ''A challenger faces an uphill fight and needs lots of money and turnout to go his way.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham, who runs a management consulting firm out of his home, is quick to note his achievements as a lawyer, author and occasional television and radio commentator who has addressed a range of issues, particularly race relations. His most recent book, ''Our Kind of People: Inside America's Black Upper Class'' (HarperCollins, 1999), was critically acclaimed. He first gained notice for a 1992 New York magazine cover story in which he reported on how he was treated while posing as a busboy at an elite Connecticut country club.</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham yesterday portrayed Mrs. Kelly as beholden to special interests and as a puppet of the Republican leadership. He said she had ignored concerns of her constituents, who he said had seen their complaints about high property taxes, underfinanced public schools and soaring medical costs go unanswered. ''I could no longer stand by silently as I saw politics work against constituents,'' Mr. Graham said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kelly, through her spokesman, Rob Ostrander, said that she believed her constituents were more familiar with her record than Mr. Graham was, and that she had been responsive to their needs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham is not the only Democrat angling to challenge Mrs. Kelly, though he has won key endorsements from the party chairmen in Westchester, Putnam and Orange Counties, and party leaders say they believe he has the flair and resources to seriously challenge Mrs. Kelly.</p>
        <p>Robert W. Elliott, the mayor of Croton-on-Hudson, said today that he planned to announce his candidacy soon, though he is not nearly as well financed as Mr. Graham, who has raised more than $255,000, about of half of it his own money.</p>
        <p>Republicans do not appear to be taking the race in stride. An hour after Mr. Graham announced his candidacy here, the chairman of the Orange County Republican Party faxed reporters copies of letters to the Justice Department and Federal Elections Commission accusing Mr. Graham of violating campaign finance disclosure and spending laws.</p>
        <p>The chairman, John S. Hicks, said in the letters that Mr. Graham's personal financial disclosure statement was long overdue and that he violated a federal ban on corporate donations by using his business phone three months ago for campaign purposes, thus making an illegal ''in kind'' donation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham called the accusations baseless, saying he had not yet passed the deadline for the disclosure statement and that the phone listing was an error that had been corrected. Justice Department and Federal Election Commission spokesmen said they had not yet received the complaints but would  review them to decide whether to investigate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham suggested that Mrs. Kelly had devised the complaints to steal attention from his announcement, an assertion Mrs. Kelly denied through Mr. Ostrander. ''Mr. Graham brags about his Ivy League law degree,'' Mr. Ostrander said, referring to some of Mr. Graham's campaign materials that prominently list his Harvard Law degree. ''When you point out he has failed to comply with elementary election law, he blames someone else. It would seem a lawyer who wants to be a congressman ought to comply with the law.''</p>
