        <p>The privately owned Hunt Oil Company of Dallas has made a friendly $328 million cash bid for the Newport Petroleum Corporation of Calgary, Alberta, and will assume $190 million of Newport's debt. At 5.50 Canadian dollars a share, or about $3.85, the offer is 10 percent above Newport's closing price on the Toronto Stock Exchange last Friday. Hunt has been trying to expand its Canadian subsidiary, which is based in Calgary, and last month lost a hostile bid for Ulster Petroleums Ltd. of Calgary to Anderson Exploration Ltd.</p>
