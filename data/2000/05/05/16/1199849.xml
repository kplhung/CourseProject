      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>It doesn't pay to take American Ballet Theater's ''Don Quixote'' too seriously. That was borne out by performances of the sunny, enjoyably silly production on Friday night and Saturday afternoon at the Metropolitan Opera House. Staged by Kevin McKenzie, the company's artistic director, and Susan Jones, a company ballet master, this ''Don Quixote'' embraces the comedy of the 19th-century original by Marius Petipa rather than the darker naturalism of a later version by Alexander Gorsky, though it draws from both. The character of Don Quixote in all his tattered dignity has survived relatively intact along with plot elements from the Cervantes novel.</p>
        <p>Paloma Herrera and Julio Bocca, who replaced the injured Jose Manuel Carreno, abandoned themselves to the Keystone Kops pace of this production on Friday night in playful, excitingly danced portrayals of the impoverished young barber Basilio and Kitri, the girl he loves.</p>

        <p>It doesn't pay to take American Ballet Theater's ''Don Quixote'' too seriously. That was borne out by performances of the sunny, enjoyably silly production on Friday night and Saturday afternoon at the Metropolitan Opera House. Staged by Kevin McKenzie, the company's artistic director, and Susan Jones, a company ballet master, this ''Don Quixote'' embraces the comedy of the 19th-century original by Marius Petipa rather than the darker naturalism of a later version by Alexander Gorsky, though it draws from both. The character of Don Quixote in all his tattered dignity has survived relatively intact along with plot elements from the Cervantes novel.</p>
        <p>Paloma Herrera and Julio Bocca, who replaced the injured Jose Manuel Carreno, abandoned themselves to the Keystone Kops pace of this production on Friday night in playful, excitingly danced portrayals of the impoverished young barber Basilio and Kitri, the girl he loves.</p>
        <p>One moment in the first act defined their savvy exuberance: Mr. Bocca slyly embellished a razzmatazz high one-armed lift by casually strolling across the stage with Ms. Herrera perched up there in all her glory. Nothing looked forced in their glorious dancing and they brought a softening sweetness to the strong-willed Kitri and the rascally Basilio.</p>
        <p>Guillaume Graffin was a delicious Gamache at both performances, letting this rich, foppish suitor of the despairing Kitri fly through every pratfall with his dignity intact. One small first-act vignette, when Gamache and Kitri's hapless father, Lorenzo, quietly talk and drink each other to near-oblivion at a corner table in Lorenzo's tavern, was a comic gem.</p>
        <p>Julie Kent and Angel Corella, who played Kitri and Basilio on Saturday afternoon, are creatures of light. They are pure dancers whose attempts to justify these characters dramatically resulted in largely flat portrayals. Ms. Kent is normally a persuasive actress, but this was like watching a Chekhov specialist try Auntie Mame. The warmth, clarity and simplicity of Mr. Corella's dancing always carry the day and they did here, though fewer of those faddish skater's-spin finishes would have been welcome.</p>
        <p>Carlos Molina made a stylish role debut on Saturday as Espada, the cape-twirling matador, using his long elegant body to buoyant effect. Sandra Brown was a standout as his spitfire girlfriend Mercedes. The more experienced Maxim Belotserkovsky lasted better through the demanding second-act solo, but he and Irina Dvorovenko needed to have more fun with the roles. Victor Barbee emphasized the vigor and determination of Don Quixote's search for the ideal on Friday night, with Brian Reeder a touchingly decrepit Quixote at the matinee. Vladislav Kalinin and Flavio Salazar were the sweetly bumbling Sancho Panzas on Friday and Saturday respectively.</p>
        <p>One of the greatest pleasures was Saturday's dream scene, whose genuinely dreamlike tone was set by Ms. Kent's luminous classicism and by Anne Milewski's tender, well-danced Amour and Gillian Murphy's coolly regal Dryad Queen. The strong but nicely frothy dancing of Ms. Murphy and Michele Wiles as Friday's Flower girls was another highlight, as was the soloist-level dancing of the six toreadors and the passionate abandon of Erica Cornejo's Gypsy woman at both performances.</p>
        <p>The lead cast on Friday was completed by Ethan Brown as an enjoyably stolid Lorenzo, Joaquin De Luz as an extra-explosive Gypsy Man, and Yan Chen (Amour) and Ekaterina Shelkanova (Dryad Queen). Saturday's leads also included John Gardner as an unusually gentle Lorenzo, and Oksana Konobeyeva and Ms. Shelkanova (Flower Girls) and Sascha Radetsky (Gypsy Man).</p>
        <p>Ermanno Florio conducted the Minkus score at both performances.</p>
