        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani raised more money last night for his Senate campaign, telling a small crowd of supporters at a Manhattan restaurant, ''I'm very much inclined to do this.''</p>
        <p>But he continued to say during the day that he had not yet decided on his cancer treatment or whether he was definitely in the race.</p>
        <p>Republicans reacted with growing exasperation.</p>
        <p>''Like 'Waiting for Godot,' we have 'Waiting for Rudy,' '' said James Cavanaugh, the Westchester County Republican chairman, who said the mayor needed to make a decision about the campaign this week. ''There's a recognition that if we're going to go to a new candidate, we have to start yesterday. We need a pretty fast answer from the mayor as to whether he's in or out.''</p>
        <p>Stephen Minarik, the Monroe County chairman, sounded a similar alarm. ''We need a decision,'' he said. ''Like tomorrow would be nice. Because this is getting ridiculous.''</p>
        <p>But other Republicans said they were not going to pressure Mr. Giuliani with a deadline for fear that he would use it to get out of the race. Still others said the mayor, who appeared relaxed and tanned at a standing-room-only noon news conference in the City Hall Blue Room, seemed more likely to stay in for now. At the least, they said, Mr. Giuliani did not appear unhappy keeping the  state party on edge guessing his next move.</p>
        <p>''He seemed to like the attention,'' said one top state Republican official who watched the mayor at the news conference. ''He seems to be going through some sort of catharsis in public. And we're like psychiatrists watching it. I can't quite figure it out. I don't think anybody can.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani did say at the news conference that he was canceling a fund-raising trip to California today and Wednesday to meet with doctors and think through his options, and added that ''things involving my personal life'' had kept him from consulting with more doctors last week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani gave his usual campaign speech about the city's revival at last night's $1,000-per-person fund-raiser, held at Martini's restaurant at Seventh Avenue and 53rd Street. The crowd of 50 enthusiastically applauded the mayor. Afterward, Mr. Giuliani spoke briefly to reporters, telling them, as he has repeatedly in recent weeks, that he hopes to be able to run.</p>
        <p>One supporter at the event, Thyra Hanna of Westchester County, said it was important to support the mayor  during a difficult time. ''I feel bad for the poor guy,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In the last two and a half weeks, Mr. Giuliani has announced that he has prostate cancer, has a very good female friend and is seeking a separation from his wife. He has also said  he stands by earlier denials that he did not have an intimate relationship with an aide, Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas, as his estranged wife suggested last Wednesday. Ms. Lategano-Nicholas said on Thursday that her relationship with Mr. Giuliani had never been sexual.</p>
        <p>The state Republican Party has been incredulous at the disclosures of the mayor, who spent Friday night at a restaurant and then strolled  around the Upper East Side in a explosion of flashbulbs with his good friend, Judith Nathan. It was the same day that Mr. Giuliani's wife, Donna Hanover, left Gracie Mansion with their two children to spend Mother's Day weekend with her family in California.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hanover's press secretary, Joannie Danielides, said yesterday that Ms. Hanover would return to Gracie Mansion in a few more days with her children, whom she kept out of school this week for the trip.</p>
        <p>Ms. Danielides also said Ms. Hanover had received various ''requests and offers'' since the mayor announced their separation without Ms. Hanover's knowledge last Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''People have been calling like there's no tomorrow,'' Ms. Danielides said.</p>
        <p>She added that Ms. Hanover and Mr. Giuliani would continue to live in the large upstairs family quarters of Gracie Mansion as they worked out their separation agreement.</p>
        <p>At his news conference, the mayor said he felt under no pressure from  Republicans to make a decision, even though the party has to nominate its Senate candidate in two weeks. The pressure, the mayor said, was internal.</p>
        <p>''I feel under pressure,'' he said, emphasizing the word ''I.''</p>
        <p>''I feel it's right that I make a decision.''</p>
        <p>He offered no timetable. Some Republicans predicted last week that Mr. Giuliani would announce his decision on his medical treatment, if nothing else, today to distract attention from Hillary Rodham Clinton's big moment in Albany, where the state Democratic Party is to nominate her as its candidate for the Senate. But Mr. Giuliani said that he would not, and that he would spend today on a ''much reduced schedule so that I can do some private things.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's comments came as Republicans appeared to be coalescing around Representative Rick A. Lazio as their candidate if the mayor  does not run. Mr. Lazio's aides said yesterday that he was increasingly certain to seek the seat if Mr. Giuliani withdrew.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Gov. George E. Pataki said at a news conference that he had no interest in the seat and would probably seek re-election in 2002. Theodore J. Forstmann, a Wall Street investor and philanthropist, announced last night that he would not run.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, continued to decline to comment on Mr. Giuliani's situation as she prepared to go to Albany to accept her party's nomination.</p>
        <p>Yesterday she received the backing of the New York State Building and Construction Trades Council, a notable endorsement because the statewide labor organization often supports Republicans and has a history of backing the mayor.</p>
        <p>At his news conference, Mr. Giuliani said he thought more often about dying now than he did before his cancer diagnosis.</p>
        <p>''Of course I do,'' he said. ''Yes. You have to face it and deal with it. Everybody thinks about dying and has fears of dying, and you're not human if you don't.''</p>
