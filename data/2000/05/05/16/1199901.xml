        <p>The battle to contain the wildfire here has broken down into several diverging fronts, with modest signs of hope in the town of Los Alamos, where most residents were allowed to return today, but growing anger over the fire's threat to ancient Indian dwellings and lands that tribal officials say had initially not been well protected.</p>
        <p>A visit today to Santa Clara Canyon, at the northern perimeter of the fire, brought encounters with swirls of thick white smoke, brush fires just yards from the road, occasionally exploding pine trees and nervous teams of firefighters known as hotshots. Some of them conceded that they were able to do little more than hope that blazes along the southern edge of the canyon would not be blasted by the winds toward the invaluable archaeological sites.</p>
        <p>In the town of Los Alamos, at the southern edge of the wildfire, and at the nuclear weapons laboratory nearby, officials said the fire was largely contained and that about two-thirds of the 11,000 evacuated residents were permitted to return this afternoon, earlier than had been expected.</p>
        <p>But officials continue to take stock of the staggering losses, which include 405 housing units and, at the lab site, five dilapidated but historic structures where parts of the original atomic bomb were assembled for the Manhattan Project during World War II.</p>
        <p>Just one of the old wooden structures remained: the building where the conventional explosives portion of the first bomb, known as Trinity, was put together. The building where the Trinity bomb was assembled was taken down years ago, said Turnel Martinez, a lab spokesman.</p>
        <p>Fire officials said in Los Alamos that while the fire had consumed at least 44,323 acres the pace of destruction has slowed. More important, they said, the fire was 28 percent contained, mostly along its southern and southeastern edges, near the city of Los Alamos.</p>
        <p>A total of 1,268 firefighters are now battling the blaze in the forested areas and 250 or so protecting homes and other structures in populated areas, a level that Jim Paxon, a spokesman for the Forest Service, said would probably be the peak.</p>
        <p>The fire was set 11 days ago by the National Park Service as a prescribed burn in an effort to thin dense ponderosa pine forests, before high winds helped create a blaze out of control.</p>
        <p>Though the news was generally good concerning containment in the south, winds are expected to pick up, and a cold front is predicted for Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Many residents have continued to fear possible leaks of radiation from the grounds of the lab, either from structures that might have been damaged by fire, or from old dump sites where, years ago, the lab placed low-level radioactive waste.</p>
        <p>Officials at the lab said that no buildings containing radioactive materials had been damaged and that their sensors had detected no radiation leaks. Also, Gregg Dempsey, director of an Environmental Protection Agency unit that monitors radiation, said the government had placed 20 more monitors around the Los Alamos region.</p>
        <p>''At this time, we're not seeing any cause for concern for radiological release,'' said Jim Straka, a Department of Energy official involved in the monitoring.</p>
        <p>But to the north, Indian officials expressed concern over what they said was a slow initial response to the fire in their area, and the heavy blow they could suffer if the fire jumped across the Santa Clara canyon on the pueblo, or reservation, northeast of Los Alamos.</p>
        <p>The Santa Clara Pueblo covers almost 50,000 acres and has about 1,500 residents. It is also home to spectacular ancient dwellings believed to have been built about 800 years ago into the buff-hued sandstone of the Puye cliffs.</p>
        <p>''If we lose that canyon and the creek, we lose quite a bit of our resources,'' said Denny Gutierrez, the governor of the Santa Clara Pueblo tribal authority.</p>
        <p>He said a major source of revenue for the tribe were the fees for permits to hunt, fish and camp in the canyon and for visits to the Puye cliffs. A big concern is that the fire could dump huge amounts of ash into the Santa Clara creek, in the bottom of the canyon, choking it off and making it unusable for irrigation or recreation.</p>
        <p>''Economically, that would probably devastate the pueblo,'' Governor Gutierrez said.</p>
        <p>He said that firefighters were now doing an excellent job but that when the fire first burst out of control, they were slow in responding to suggestions to build fire lines on its northern edge, not just in the south near Los Alamos.</p>
        <p>''It just sounded to us like this was not a priority,'' said Charles Sisneros, a tribal council member. ''They just wanted to let the fire burn itself out up here. That's not the way we see it. This is our home and we have an obligation to protect it.''</p>
        <p>Dale Baca, another member of the tribal council, stood in the bottom of the canyon today watching the blaze send up huge plumes of white smoke and brush fires burn to the road, and said he was also angry.</p>
        <p>''The indecision was the problem,'' he said. ''We asked them to cut the fire lines on the Forest Service land and they just said they hadn't gotten the permission.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Paxon of the Forest Service said the firefighters had done all they could. ''Our object is to minimize the impact on the Santa Clara Pueblo,'' he said. ''We do take their needs to heart. We feel we have adequate resources there. We didn't delay.''</p>
        <p>Firefighters said the pueblo lands were now among the most vulnerable, particularly if the wind does whip up as expected. Jerry Soard, a member of a hotshot crew from Carson City, Nev., watched as the fire spread its dark fingers down the canyon and tightened its grip over the heavily wooded Indian land. He expressed some optimism because the fire was moving slowly and removing highly combustible brush that could feed an even fiercer fire if the winds picked up.</p>
        <p>''It's doing pretty much what we want it to do at this point,'' said Mr. Soard. ''This is beneficial. It's a real nice backing fire.''</p>
        <p>Asked if this meant the fire might be brought under control here, another hotshot team member, Chris White, laughed.</p>
        <p>''Control? You can't say that,'' said Mr. White. ''Not with these winds. The problem is that when they get into the canyon they get so squirrely. They blow every direction.''</p>
