        <p>The sound system just wasn't happening at the Polish National Home, but the strained, suffering speakers added a new dimension to the electronic music that was drilling through them: homeliness. The Beer and Sausage Festival, a three-day experimental event in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, which finished up with a night of electronics on Friday, took place in a building that is normally host to polka dances; Polish food was served up in a side room.</p>
        <p>If any context could properly demystify the rogue tendencies of European avant-gardism, it was this one.And if Friday's lineup had a theme beyond electronics, it was the influential Austrian record label Mego, home of the electronic artists Pita and Fennesz, who were both on the bill. Pan Sonic, a duo from Finland, also has a connection to the label via one of its members, Ilpo Vaisanen, who is releasing a solo record on Mego this year.</p>

        <p>The sound system just wasn't happening at the Polish National Home, but the strained, suffering speakers added a new dimension to the electronic music that was drilling through them: homeliness. The Beer and Sausage Festival, a three-day experimental event in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, which finished up with a night of electronics on Friday, took place in a building that is normally host to polka dances; Polish food was served up in a side room.</p>
        <p>If any context could properly demystify the rogue tendencies of European avant-gardism, it was this one.And if Friday's lineup had a theme beyond electronics, it was the influential Austrian record label Mego, home of the electronic artists Pita and Fennesz, who were both on the bill. Pan Sonic, a duo from Finland, also has a connection to the label via one of its members, Ilpo Vaisanen, who is releasing a solo record on Mego this year.</p>
        <p>There are various spectrums in the new electronic music: tone-based to toneless, beat-crazy to rhythmless, assaultive to gentle, narrative to monolithic. Whatever it is, it isn't passive or quaint -- electronic music is being flocked to by young composers who are doing to it something like what punk bands did to rock 'n' roll in the mid-70's, and Mego is the equivalent of an aesthetic-structuring punk label like Stiff.</p>
        <p>Pan Sonic uses tones, but usually low and rumbling, and they're boosted high enough to make your rib cage shake. The Beer and Sausage Festival's major disadvantage was that it didn't have a set of speakers at the back of the room, too: you could tell that the duo's slow, pulsating rhythms under screaming synthetic tones were meant to affect the audience physically. Occasionally, letting go of whatever they were building up, they just unleashed pure, furious noise; it was a music of cruelty amid dry pleasures.</p>
        <p>Pita (Peter Rehberg) and Fennesz, who both performed with only laptop computers and small mixing consoles, were interesting contrasts. Pita, right out of the gates, turned on a grimy, thumping two-beat rhythm; then, with an oscillating effect, the beats broke up into tiny blips, and finally disappeared into a toneless, head-exploding whirr. This was how he continued for half an hour, shifting prewritten sound files on his computer into a new mixture.</p>
        <p>Fennesz, on the other hand, performing for the first time in New York, allowed his music to breathe, using long gaps of near silence (broken only by tiny, glitchy data-stream sounds) as parts of his improvised piece. While his only patterned beats were begrimed with sludgy electronic treatment, he alluded to a major signifier of hard-core dance music -- the repeated electric-piano chords of house. Slowly, his music became pleasing, enveloping: there was a kernel of real romanticism inside the machine.</p>
