        <p>It seems that taxi drivers are the same all over the world, taking hairpin turns as if they were driving in the Indianapolis 500 -- or, here, the Grand Prix in Monaco -- and subjecting passengers to unsolicited opinions. When one driver overheard muttering about the ride's resemblance to the Joel and Ethan Coen film ''The Big Lebowski,'' in which a surly cabby literally tosses a passenger out of the car for objecting to his taste, he smiled and joined in the conversation.</p>
        <p>''My English is catastrophic,'' he said, and then mentioned his love of that movie and the Coens. ''They will be here.''</p>

        <p>It seems that taxi drivers are the same all over the world, taking hairpin turns as if they were driving in the Indianapolis 500 -- or, here, the Grand Prix in Monaco -- and subjecting passengers to unsolicited opinions. When one driver overheard muttering about the ride's resemblance to the Joel and Ethan Coen film ''The Big Lebowski,'' in which a surly cabby literally tosses a passenger out of the car for objecting to his taste, he smiled and joined in the conversation.</p>
        <p>''My English is catastrophic,'' he said, and then mentioned his love of that movie and the Coens. ''They will be here.''</p>
        <p>''They have a film with George Clooney in the competition,'' he volunteered cheerily, referring to the Coens' period comedy, ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' and highlighting a difference between Cannes and most other cities.</p>
        <p>For the two weeks or so of the Cannes International Film Festival, this city becomes obsessed with movies and moviemakers who are equally obsessed with promoting their films, a situation that leads to a flood of Americans. Probably the last time such a large number of Americans were butchering the language on the beaches of France was during the Normandy invasion.</p>
        <p>The snarl of visitors clogging the Croisette -- the main drag, where much of the action takes place -- has increased this year as the number of dot-coms has multiplied. Most of them arrived here with ''reel'' in their names, like reelshort and reelplay.</p>
        <p>Unlike major North American festivals -- New York, Sundance, Toronto -- Cannes is both a competitive festival and a marketplace. The onslaught of information can be almost as overwhelming as jet lag. That leads to perhaps the most pervasive frustration of all the festivals, since no one could possibly get to all the films.</p>
        <p>Then there's the scrambling by natives and visitors to hustle their way into the parties, the last sign of Hollywood flash since attention-getting schemes like sending elephants down the Croisette have gone the way of the woolly mastodon. The consensus among veterans is that there are more films here, but that things are quieter, with less overt sleaziness and more of a Eurotrash Sundance vibe.</p>
        <p>One festival newcomer is Gene Hackman. When asked how he managed to avoid attending the festival until now, Mr. Hackman grinned and said: ''Just lucky, I guess. I'm not sure what it does, but . . .'' He shrugged.</p>
        <p>He's here with ''Under Suspicion,'' in which he stars with Morgan Freeman. The film is a remake of Claude Miller's French policier ''Garde a Vue,'' a cat-and-mouse game in which a detective (Mr. Freeman) tries to persuade, or coerce, a confession out of an assured plutocrat (Mr. Hackman). Mr. Hackman said he had seen the original years ago in Los Angeles and had been trying to get it back to the screen since then.</p>
        <p>''We went to see some other film and walked out of it,'' he recalled. ''I wish I could remember what we walked out of. That'd make a great story. We wandered into another theater, and 'Garde' was playing. We missed the first five minutes, so I went back the next night and then tried to option it after I saw it. But it was too expensive. They wanted a million dollars for it.'</p>
        <p>When Mr. Hackman did get his hands on it, he sent it to Arthur Penn, who directed him in ''Bonnie and Clyde.''</p>
        <p>''I trust Arthur,'' he said. ''He worked on it with a writer for a long time. But they couldn't lick it. I'm sorry he couldn't figure it out to his liking.''</p>
        <p>Years later he gave it to Mr. Freeman, shortly after they worked together on ''Unforgiven.'' ''Morgan has an intelligence about him that makes him a worthy adversary,'' Mr. Hackman said, laughing. ''I told him he could play either role, but I was praying he didn't want the good part.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hackman acknowledged that ''Suspicion'' was different from ''Garde.'' ''Americans don't want subtlety,'' he said. ''So it is broader, much more class-based. My character has a sense of entitlement about him, not as physical as other parts I've played and even a bit of a coward, which I liked about it.'</p>
        <p>There was a time when Mr. Hackman wanted to direct, but it has passed. ''I realize I don't have the patience,'' he said. ''I can be a curmudgeon on the set. I like directors who say 'faster, slower, funnier' because I've done the psychological preparation already, like any actor.''</p>
        <p>While pursuing ''Garde,'' he let go of a picture he had planned to direct and star in, ''Silence of the Lambs.''</p>
        <p>''I owned 'Silence,' '' he said. ''One of my daughters, who'd read some other Thomas Harris, read it and said: 'You can't do that, Dad. Hannibal's too gross.' I don't think I really have the skill to do it either. I got Ted Tally involved, after seeing his play 'Nuts' in Chicago, but eventually I sold it back to Orion.''</p>
        <p>Damaged Souls</p>
        <p>The competition film ''Harry, He's Here to Help'' is reminiscent of French noirish meditations like ''Garde a Vue'' or those portraits of the damaged souls of the bourgeoisie made famous by the director Claude Chabrol, pictures like ''Just Before Nightfall.''</p>
        <p>In ''Harry,'' directed by Dominik Moll, Michel (Laurent Lucas) is a husband and father suffering as he tries to please his wife, his demanding young daughters and his overbearing lecher of a father. There's nothing left for himself when Harry (Sergi Lopez), a successful grade school friend, finds him. Harry's devotion begins to take unsettling turns, and the long-faced Michel, who looks like one of the Gallagher brothers from the rock group Oasis, is disturbed by it.</p>
        <p>Or maybe not, since Mr. Lucas's impassivity makes it hard to tell. The film is bland and predictable when it means to be creepy and unsettling. There's an unspoken homoerotic vein in Harry's doggedness that the picture attributes to a crazy streak that is unexplained, though the bumping off of Michel's loutish dad is a mercy killing. ''Harry'' is most successful at showing the stresses of parenthood; Michel's three little girls fight for attention in the way that children can.</p>
        <p>'Lear' in the Desert</p>
        <p>One of the most talked-about festival films that is not in competition is another slap at the middle class, the Dogma film ''The King Is Alive,'' directed by Kristian Levring. Like most pictures that adhere to the rules of Dogma, the Danish film movement, people were either drawn to it or repelled by it. The filmmakers who take on the uniform nonconformity of the Dogma style of hand-held realism are essentially shooting ''Playhouse 90'' melodramas with a Betacam.</p>
        <p>''King'' is no exception. In the film a busload of tourists, stranded in an abandoned town in the African desert, try to distract themselves by staging ''King Lear.''</p>
        <p>There's nothing else quite like ''King'' here. In its way it seems to be a combination of ''Gilligan's Island'' and ''The Blair Witch Project'' with elements of ''Shakespeare in Love.'' The desert setting was almost tailor-made for Dogma, lending itself to the coarse grain of the high-definition video cameras used to make these films.</p>
        <p>''King'' is the most visually impressive Dogma work thus far and has a delirious beauty. Some bits, like a sex scene with the lovers covered in sand and a shot of Bruce Davison collapsed on a sand dune, are captivating to watch.</p>
        <p>Labor of Love</p>
        <p>''Bread and Roses,'' in competition at the festival, is the first United States-based film by the British social-realist director Ken Loach, whose career includes ''Poor Cow'' and ''My Name Is Joe.''</p>
        <p>''L.A. is one of the most difficult places to work,'' Mr. Loach said of the film's setting. ''Everyone has lost their innocence there. You have to work to keep excited.''</p>
        <p>Cannes's single-mindedness about show business doesn't interest him. ''I don't know much about the business, so no one talks to me about who bought whom,'' he said with soft-spoken intensity. He is amused by the festival, he said, having been here with films six times.</p>
        <p>Mention of ''Bread and Roses,'' which follows the struggle of a group of immigrant janitorial workers against their exploitative bosses through the eyes of a Mexican family, also brings a smile to Mr. Loach's face.</p>
        <p>''I wish we were out there now,'' he said, referring to the recent janitors' strike in Los Angeles. ''I spent a lot of time with janitors, going out on marches with them and the like.''</p>
        <p>The movie, which stars Elpidia Carillo and Pilar Padilla as sisters and Adrien Brody as a firebrand union organizer, could be this generation's ''Norma Rae.'' The subject intrigued Mr. Loach because of the way he was able to use Hispanic actors, he said, adding, ''It's about them, instead of them being extras behind whites.''</p>
        <p>''Bread'' features his trademark empathy and has a potent integrity. ''You can't help but be touched,'' Mr. Loach said. ''This story and how it fits into the world is all part of a wider engagement. Otherwise why spend a year of your life on it?''</p>
        <p>The relationship between the two sisters -- beautifully played by Ms. Carillo, who should have been a star years ago, and Ms. Padilla -- is powerful and gives a sense of familial history bigger than the film's social concerns.</p>
        <p>''I hadn't seen her before,'' Mr. Loach said of Ms. Carillo. ''It's easier that way, because you don't know what they've done. Instead you're trying to find out who they are, how they listen, the way they use words.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Loach's influence can be seen in a whole generation of British actors like Tim Roth, who has a cameo in ''Bread.'' (His directorial debut, ''The War Room,'' proudly follows in Mr. Loach's footsteps.).</p>
        <p>''Tim just came along as a mate,'' Mr. Loach said, sheepishly. ''I don't know about influencing anyone. It's very nice to think that.''</p>
        <p>Part of ''Poor Cow'' was used for the flashback sequences of the young Terence Stamp in Steven Soderbergh's 1999 crime story, ''The Limey.''</p>
        <p>''I met Soderbergh, and he was helpful on this film, suggesting people for the crew,'' Mr. Loach said. He sat back and sighed.</p>
        <p>''It was strange to see that old film again,'' he said, ''hard to go back. The one you're doing now is a launchpad for the next. You have to reject the one you've just done and go on to the next.''</p>
