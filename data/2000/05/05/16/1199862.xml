        <p>On Thursday evening at the Society for Ethical Culture, members of the Orpheus chamber orchestra gave the second of three concerts in celebration of Yaddo, the artists' retreat outside Saratoga Springs, N.Y. George Tsontakis, a member of the Yaddo board and an organizing force behind these concerts, spoke of the suitability of the setting -- of the warmth and the wood and the rounded shapes, all recalling features that have made Yaddo a welcoming and inspiring place.</p>
        <p>Its welcome and its inspiration might be hard to detect in any particular piece, but at least this program showed the remarkable magnitude and variety of composers who have spent time at Yaddo. Nine were represented (with 10 more in the companion programs), and they ranged from important figures in the American musical renaissance of the 1930's and 40's -- Wallingford Riegger, Virgil Thomson -- to masters of today, the latter across the age spectrum from George Perle, who recently celebrated his 85th birthday, to Dan Coleman, still in his 20's.</p>

        <p>On Thursday evening at the Society for Ethical Culture, members of the Orpheus chamber orchestra gave the second of three concerts in celebration of Yaddo, the artists' retreat outside Saratoga Springs, N.Y. George Tsontakis, a member of the Yaddo board and an organizing force behind these concerts, spoke of the suitability of the setting -- of the warmth and the wood and the rounded shapes, all recalling features that have made Yaddo a welcoming and inspiring place.</p>
        <p>Its welcome and its inspiration might be hard to detect in any particular piece, but at least this program showed the remarkable magnitude and variety of composers who have spent time at Yaddo. Nine were represented (with 10 more in the companion programs), and they ranged from important figures in the American musical renaissance of the 1930's and 40's -- Wallingford Riegger, Virgil Thomson -- to masters of today, the latter across the age spectrum from George Perle, who recently celebrated his 85th birthday, to Dan Coleman, still in his 20's.</p>
        <p>Performances were good to decent, though the strings were more pithy than resplendent, except in Riegger's charming lullaby-style ''Romanza,'' which all string quartets should have in their repertories as an encore piece. Considerably less beguiling was Thomson's Serenade for flute and violin, though the leading flute part was staunchly and musically played by Tara O'Connor.</p>
        <p>Among these, Mr. Perle's ''Critical Moments'' showed a wit and an imaginative exactness that made most of his younger colleagues sound befogged. Ideas sprang to life, jumped from instrument to instrument. Small dramas happened in a few moments, usually ending on a smile or a question.</p>
        <p>Impressive, too, was Chen Yi's ''Sparkle,'' an aptly named piece of brilliance featuring slow steps in high trills from combinations of piano, marimba, vibraphone and piccolo, with always interesting backgrounds. There was a hint of Messiaen sometimes in the chordal movement and occasionally a Balinese touch, but the piece had a distinct, thrilling identity.</p>
        <p>Chou Wen-chung's string quartet ''Clouds'' closed with a finely sustained slow movement one would want to hear again. Mr. Coleman's ''Music for a Cold Night'' moved from an exciting start to cello-led nostalgia. Mr. Tsontakis made a mellow miniature, ''Microcosmos,'' to open the concert. Also played were Daniel Brewbaker's ''Serenissima'' and Aaron Jay Kernis's ''100 Greatest Dance Hits.''</p>
