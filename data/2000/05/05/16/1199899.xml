        <p>In need of a mentor, Jennifer Capriati found an effective one last year in Harold Solomon, the former member of the men's top 10 who had already helped Mary Joe Fernandez win on a regular basis.

        <p>In need of a mentor, Jennifer Capriati found an effective one last year in Harold Solomon, the former member of the men's top 10 who had already helped Mary Joe Fernandez win on a regular basis. With his guidance, Capriati, the former teenage phenom, managed to rebuild her confidence and her resume and reach the semifinals at this year's Australian Open.</p>
        <p>But today in Rome, when Capriati, 24, returned to competitive tennis after a seven-week layoff, Solomon was no longer part of her team. According to both parties, they have split amicably, and only time and future tournaments will tell if Capriati's uneven, and ultimately unsuccessful, performance in the first round of the Italian Open was a coincidence.</p>
        <p>Looking heavier than before her injury-imposed break, Capriati struggled with her serve -- double-faulting 13 times -- and with her consistency off the ground, losing, 6-3, 7-5, to Anne-Gaelle Sidot, a gifted, erratic and unproven Frenchwoman ranked 31st in the world.</p>
        <p>''It's been awhile since I played a match, so maybe I just didn't feel as comfortable out there,'' said the clearly miffed Capriati, who uncharacteristically shouted at herself at one stage in the final set.</p>
        <p>Sidot, a lean 20-year-old left-hander with a wicked one-handed backhand, was once considered more promising than her French contemporary Amelie Mauresmo. She has not managed to keep pace, although she managed to match Capriati's baseline power in sometimes spectacular fashion.</p>
        <p>It did not take her long to determine that this Capriati was not as fit as that Capriati. ''During the match I realized that she was a bit sluggish and her movement much less speedy,'' Sidot said. ''I tried to make her run. But even though I knew she had put on some weight. She still has shots that hurt.''</p>
        <p>Capriati's improved conditioning was one of the keys to her run of fine performances, which began a year ago with a tournament victory in Strasbourg, France, and continued until this March in Key Biscayne, Fla., where she reached the quarterfinals. But by then, she already had tendinitis in one of her Achilles' tendons -- an injury that forced her to withdraw from Hilton Head and, according to Capriati, kept her from practicing and working on her fitness for several weeks.</p>
        <p>''I've only been able the last couple weeks, you know, to train normal,'' she said. ''It's just sore more than anything, but it's fine. I mean I feel in good shape and still want to be in better shape.''</p>
        <p>She and Solomon made the decision to stop working together shortly after the Key Biscayne tournament. According to both parties, they did so because Capriati wanted a full-time coach and Solomon wanted to spend more time with his family in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and less time on the road.</p>
        <p>''I think she still has the capability to win a Grand Slam,'' he said of Capriati. ''Going forward for Jennifer is up to Jennifer. If she wants to continue to work really hard and be as dedicated as she has been in the last year with everything, the sky's the limit. If not, she will, like everyone, have a more difficult time.''</p>
        <p>Capriati came to Rome with her father, Stefano, her boyfriend and the ATP Tour player Xavier Malisse and a new coach, Rikard Bergh, whom Capriati considers helpful but temporary.</p>
