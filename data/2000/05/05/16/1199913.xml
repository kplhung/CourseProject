        <p>She began nosing around the gym in Oklahoma City last fall, a day here, a day there, nothing that would put any real strain on her muscles or her new lifestyle. Shannon Miller had retired after the 1996 Summer Games, her career secure as the most successful American gymnast, with seven Olympic medals, two of them gold. She was married now, attending college. She was 23 in a sport that had come to treat maturity as an impediment, where the arrival of breasts and hips was an occurrence as unfortunate as a broken ankle.</p>
        <p>Just after Christmas, Miller walked into the office of her longtime coach, Steve Nunno, and said something that she hoped would not leave him laughing. She wanted to compete in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. She had been away from the sport entirely for 18 months, but she wanted to come back.</p>
        <p>Three years after winning a gold medal in Atlanta, the American women had finished sixth among six teams in the team competition at the 1999 world championships. They seemed not to know how to train or compete, she felt. She could help them.</p>
        <p>Nunno did not laugh, nor did he encourage Miller.</p>
        <p>''Shannon, you're not an athlete anymore,'' the coach told her.</p>
        <p>''I know, that's why I'm here asking you,'' Miller said. ''I want you to help me.''</p>
        <p>Five months later, Miller is making her first appearance here at the Olympic training camp run by Bela Karolyi, the famed coach who, like Miller, has come out of retirement in hopes of hoisting a fallen American team, just as he lifted the injured Kerri Strug in Atlanta. Of the so-called Magnificent Seven who won gold in 1996, five are trying to qualify for Sydney -- Miller, Dominique Dawes, Amy Chow, Jaycie Phelps and Dominique Moceanu. Strug and Amanda Borden have declined comebacks, choosing higher education over the high bar.</p>
        <p>New selection rules for the six-member Olympic team will allow for specialists in addition to all-around competitors. Miller is the reigning Olympic champion on the balance beam. Among the Magnificent Seven, she and Chow are given the best chance of making the team for Sydney, though a final selection will not come until August. If she can remain healthy and motivated, Miller would bring her reputation, reliability and elegance to a callow team.</p>
        <p>''She represents the visibility and dignity of the team,'' Karolyi said. He added: ''Based on her prestige and background and her sturdy work ethic, I am going to give her more consideration than for anyone.''</p>
        <p>At 23, Miller also represents an urgent attempt by international gymnastics to shed its bleak reputation as a sport of inarticulate pixies and eating disorders, one in which some athletes reportedly took so-called brake drugs to inhibit the onset of puberty. The harshest critics dismissed the sport as a form of child abuse. Careers bloomed and wilted before athletes were old enough to drive or vote.</p>
        <p>To counter the mounting criticism, the sport's world governing body has in recent years raised the minimum age for Olympic gymnasts from 15 to 16. American gymnastics officials have also made extensive efforts to counsel athletes on the importance of such things as healthy, balanced diets. Professionalism has led to increased financial opportunities and prolonged careers beyond one Olympic cycle in gymnastics and other sports like track and field, softball, soccer and swimming.</p>
        <p>The average age of American Olympians in Sydney is expected to be 26. If Miller makes the team, the 2000 Summer Games would be her third.</p>
        <p>''I think Shannon is out to show that you can win medals at 23, just as she won them at 19. I think she has every capability of winning another medal on the balance beam,'' Nunno said. ''She can do the skills the others are doing, but she does them with so much power and grace.''</p>
        <p>This, however, was not what Nunno told Miller when she first announced her intentions for Sydney.</p>
        <p>For two weeks he tried to talk her out of it. She was not in shape. She had been spending her time in the classroom, not the gym. She could not even run a mile. The only spinning and tumbling she did involved the laundry. Plus, Nunno had three young children of his own. He had told his wife that he would not be leaving anymore for extended trips.</p>
        <p>''You got to answer one question,'' Nunno told Miller. ''Why?''</p>
        <p>Her response, he said, was: ''I'm embarrassed that the team finished sixth at the world championships. I can help them. I'd feel guilty if I didn't try.''</p>
        <p>There was a personal hunger, too, for the adrenaline rush of competition. Even though she had begun studying finance at the University of Oklahoma, Miller continued to look for thrills beyond the sedentary life of college. She took up figure skating. She parachuted from an airplane. And now she would try for her third Olympics. The oldest American female gymnast to win a medal in the last half-century was Kathy Johnson, who was 24 at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, which were boycotted by the Eastern bloc.</p>
        <p>Nunno agreed to coach her. Forget the sentimental notion of an athlete going out on top, he told her. Jack Nicklaus was still playing golf well beyond his prime. Muhammad Ali won a third heavyweight title on the decline. Even Michael Jordan had begun to descend the peak of his skills when he won his sixth basketball championship.</p>
        <p>She could come back, he told her, but first she needed 12 weeks of  strength and cardiovascular training, along with basic gymnastics, before she could hope to begin to retrieve the more advanced skills. Remember the hardships, not just the medals, he told Miller, the days when she did not want to come to practice and was so sore that each movement was heavy and painful.</p>
        <p>For three months, Miller trained two or three times a day, for up to eight hours, lifting weights, running on a treadmill, riding a stationary bike and relearning the rudimentary skills of gymnastics. After two weeks, she was the top athlete in the gym, Nunno said. He was stunned. She could not do the Olympic-level routines, but her form was impeccable and her internal gyroscope, her awareness in the air, seemed in perfect alignment.</p>
        <p>''She has this fire in her eye that she didn't have in '96,'' Nunno said. ''In Atlanta it was all about winning a medal for your country and trying to hang on because people were telling her she was too old at 19. She's all business now.''</p>
        <p>Not that there have not been discouraging moments. Eleven weeks into her comeback, Miller told Nunno: ''I've hit the wall. I have no life. I don't have time to do the laundry or take my taxes to the accountant. I've never worked this hard in my life.''</p>
        <p>''You've never taken two years off, either,'' Nunno fired back.</p>
        <p>He cut the conditioning phase short by a week and let Miller regain her enthusiasm. Having reshaped her body, she is now going through the grind of reshaping her career, spending hour after repetitive hour in the gym refining old skills and learning new ones. She has never been stronger and she knows the value of rest and recovery now, when to push hard, when to pull back.</p>
        <p>Does she ever think about the possibility that her comeback will fail?</p>
        <p>''Sometimes those thoughts creep in, but I push them out as quick as possible,'' Miller said. ''I can't think, 'What if I don't make it?' No matter what, I tried. That's when regret would set in, if I didn't try.''</p>
