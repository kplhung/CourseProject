        <p>When Paul Kellogg became the artistic and general director of the New York City Opera in 1996, the company was carrying a $5 million debt, had lost its sense of artistic direction and was coping emotionally with the death from AIDS of its previous director, the conductor Christopher Keene. Revitalizing the City Opera was going to be a formidable challenge. And the greatest impediment to doing so, in fundamental ways, was the New York State Theater itself, the City Opera's home since 1965, which is shared with the New York City Ballet. Rehearsal space and administrative offices had always been woefully inadequate there.</p>
        <p>The immediate problem Mr. Kellogg confronted was the poor acoustics of the  2,700-seat auditorium. Two earlier attempts to correct the problem with minor architectural adjustments had not appreciably improved the sound in the house. In exasperation, Mr. Kellogg, with the support of the City Ballet, finally approved the installation of an electronic sound enhancement system before the opening of the season last fall, surely the most controversial decision of his tenure. Natural sound has been a hallmark of the classical music heritage, and there are few places left in the world, other than opera houses and concerts halls, where audiences can experience music without the sound being processed electronically.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kellogg maintains that the sound system has been an enormous success over all. Without exception, he asserts, the company's music staff, orchestra players and singers support its use. And the vast majority of City Opera audiences either strongly approve, he says, basing his observations on feedback and mail he has received, or at least are not bothered by it.</p>
        <p>During a recent interview, Mr. Kellogg vigorously defended his decision to resort to an electronic solution for the house's poor acoustics. Yet he also indicated for the first time that the system was an ''interim solution'' for a problem that he hopes will be solved architecturally by a major renovation of the house. Discussions are under way about renovations of the entire Lincoln Center complex. A major redesign of the State Theater auditorium to improve the acoustics is on the table, though the project could easily be derailed by the sheer expense involved, which could exceed $30 million for the State Theater alone. Moreover, the auditorium is a historic and justly acclaimed  space for dance. The City Ballet, which actually prefers to minimize sound from the stage, has more interest in preserving it as is.</p>
        <p>If the renovation plan does not come to pass, Mr. Kellogg stated unequivocally,  the company will find ''another solution.'' He refused to specify what that might entail, but the only apparent solution  would be to relocate the company to a site outside Lincoln Center. That idea was raised unofficially by Mr. Kellogg's exasperated predecessors. Such a move would be Mr. Kellogg's boldest stroke by far,  challenging the idea of the urban arts complex.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Kellogg mostly wanted to talk about during the interview was good news about the company's current finances and artistic strength. The City Opera is thriving, and he has compiled the facts and figures to back his case. Debt has been erased, and the company now boasts a $12 million endowment. Fund-raising is up 50 percent since 1996. The operating budget has increased some $5 million over the same period, to $31 million for the 1999-2000 season, which ended three weeks ago. In the last year attendance has increased by 10 percent: this season the company sold an average of 83 percent of the house.</p>
        <p>How did this happen? Soon after arriving, Mr. Kellogg announced a  three-year revitalization plan with specific goals. Because the Metropolitan Opera was right across the plaza at Lincoln Center, it was essential, he felt, that City Opera distinguish itself by performing repertory the Met was not known for, especially Baroque operas and 20th-century American works. Even when the City Opera presents the staples -- ''Carmen,'' ''Tosca'' and such -- it should do so, he believed, in innovative modern productions that contrasted with the Met's grand traditionalism in the standard repertory. If the City Opera could not afford to hire renowned vocalists for, say, ''Madama Butterfly,'' then it should present casts of fresh-voiced, younger singers who looked like the characters they were portraying and were strong actors.</p>
        <p>Yet every aspect of Mr. Kellogg's vision for the company was contingent on making the house more acoustically vibrant. If attractive singers with young voices were going to flourish there, the sound in the auditorium had to become more alive. If Baroque operas were going to be presented effectively, and if audiences new to opera were going to be attracted to it, then the house had to be made to feel more intimate.</p>
        <p>''For so long, so many people complained about the acoustics of the State Theater, its unfriendliness to young voices, the dryness and unevenness of the sound in the house,'' Mr. Kellogg said. The press complained continually, he added. The company had to find an interim solution.</p>
        <p>Of course, until recently, the idea that the sound system might become a permanent feature of even a renovated State Theater was very much alive. When the system was installed, Mr. Kellogg asked wary critics and audiences for a grace period. He promised to present a demonstration for critics and patrons to hear just how subtly, in his opinion, the system works. Excerpts from operas would be performed with the system switched off and on. That demonstration has never occurred, he conceded, citing the expense involved.</p>
        <p>Last fall he also said that once the system was installed and fine-tuned, the controls and levels would be set and never tampered with. It was important, he felt, that the State Theater have a distinctive house sound.</p>
        <p>But even at the Met, with its quite good acoustics, the house sound varies from production to production, mostly depending on the size and placement of sets. Wouldn't it be impossible for technicians at the State Theater to resist fiddling with the controls from night to night? If the capability exists, it is human nature to utilize it.</p>
        <p>Sure enough, not only has daily tinkering become commonplace, Mr. Kellogg conceded, but on some nights the system has been turned off completely, he said, though no announcements were made to the press and public. This put audiences, but especially critics who are expected to offer informed evaluations, in an impossible situation. Can we trust what we are hearing?</p>
        <p>That singers and musicians apparently support the sound system is not really surprising. Why shouldn't they take advantage of electronic assistance in an acoustically unfriendly house? That audiences have largely embraced it is also to be expected. Amplification has become pervasive, and the younger audiences the company is attracting, having grown up with electronic sound, are unlikely even to notice.</p>
        <p>''The fact is, no matter what, people are going to complain about the sound in this house,'' Mr. Kellogg said. ''This system is a way of solving the problem on an interim basis. The audience is not reacting, for the most part, on a matter of principle. Nor am I.'' Critics can ''wring their hands as much as they like,'' he added. ''It works for me.''</p>
        <p>Defenders, even among critics, argue that there is a difference between real amplification, typical today in Broadway theaters where singers wear body microphones, and systems that enhance the acoustical properties of a hall itself. But whatever labels are coined to describe the equipment, voices are still being picked up by microphones, carried through wires and disseminated through dozens, even hundreds, of tiny speakers that cover the walls.</p>
        <p>And just as on Broadway, the use of sound systems in opera and concert music will eventually affect the way singers sing, musicians play, audiences hear and composers write. Mr. Kellogg maintains that the State Theater system ''allows voices to be heard as they really are,'' and that it ''does not make a small voice large or an ugly voice pretty.''</p>
        <p>I am not convinced, nor are some other critics, and at least a vocal minority of audience members. Because of the enhancement system, certain sounds -- a soprano's sustained, full-voiced high notes, for example -- are almost always piercingly present. Some sounds get oddly emphasized. During a recent performance of Virgil Thomson's ''Mother of Us All,'' the opera sounded at times like a concerto for snare drum.</p>
        <p>Of course, we have this adventurous and increasingly essential company to thank for finally bringing us the first production ever by a major New York opera house of Thomson's great American opera, as well as many other important works, like  Rameau's ''Platee'' in the imaginative production by Mark Morris (which sold 95 percent of the house in six performances). Next season come other rarities and treats, like Prokofiev's ''Love of Three Oranges'' and Handel's ''Rinaldo'' with the splendid countertenor David Daniels in the title role.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kellogg readily agreed that there was ''no substitute for a house whose good acoustics are architectural.'' He hopes this can be achieved at the State Theater. It falls to critics, then, to point out the shortcomings of the current system.</p>
        <p>Last week the company presented ''Showcasing American Composers 2000,'' an invaluable contribution to the city's cultural life and the future of American opera. Over a period of two weeks, excerpts of roughly 25 minutes each from 12 American operas, either works-in-progress or existing operas that have yet to be produced, were performed in open readings with a full orchestra and strong vocal soloists at the Great Hall of Cooper Union.</p>
        <p>This is the second consecutive year that these free performances were presented. The rehearsal schedule was tight but sufficient to give the composers, interested singers and operagoers and, most important, potential producers a good sense of the various works. That Mr. Kellogg and his company secured funds for this important project demonstrates how fully they are committed to the future of American opera. The Met has done nothing remotely as helpful to the cause.</p>
        <p>That the City Opera's showcase was taking place off-site, downtown, not far from the home of the most famous organization to bolt Lincoln Center, Joseph Papp's Public Theater, seemed significant. What other bold ventures could the newly energized City Opera undertake if it could just scrap that sound system and fix up its house, or, maybe even get out of Lincoln Center and start afresh?</p>
