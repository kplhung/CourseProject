        <p>New Jersey's Democratic primary for the United States Senate took on an increasingly testy tone today, as former Gov. Jim Florio and Jon S. Corzine used a candidates' forum on a New York radio station to spar over Social Security, education financing  and racial profiling.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, who had appeared nervous and unfocused during much of last week's televised debate, seemed far more relaxed today as he sat in the Manhattan studio of WLIB-AM (1190), describing his proposals for expensive new social programs and accusing Mr. Florio of demagogy in describing Mr. Corzine's position on Social Security.</p>

        <p>New Jersey's Democratic primary for the United States Senate took on an increasingly testy tone today, as former Gov. Jim Florio and Jon S. Corzine used a candidates' forum on a New York radio station to spar over Social Security, education financing  and racial profiling.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, who had appeared nervous and unfocused during much of last week's televised debate, seemed far more relaxed today as he sat in the Manhattan studio of WLIB-AM (1190), describing his proposals for expensive new social programs and accusing Mr. Florio of demagogy in describing Mr. Corzine's position on Social Security.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine also went on the offensive, attacking Mr. Florio's record as governor on the issue of racial profiling, a matter of particular interest to the audience of WLIB, a talk radio station aimed at blacks.</p>
        <p>''I don't really think this is an issue that was adequately addressed under the governor's term,'' Mr. Corzine said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio, not one to avoid a confrontation, said he had aggressively sought to stop profiling when he was governor, although later in the debate he conceded that he wished he had acted earlier in his term. Mr. Florio also continued his strategy of using the debates to raise doubts about Mr. Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, by portraying him as a politically inexperienced multimillionaire who is trying to buy the election.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Corzine said he supported affirmative action, Mr. Florio said proudly that during his four years as governor, he had appointed more blacks, Latinos and women to government jobs than had any of his predecessors.</p>
        <p>''It's one thing to talk about it,'' Mr. Florio said. ''I've done it.''</p>
        <p>In a sign that the contest is tightening and the candidates are growing more antagonistic toward each other, they spent part of the hourlong encounter sparring over whether to participate in additional debates. Mr. Florio said his rival was ''blowing off'' the League of Women Voters, saying Mr. Corzine was the only Senate candidate, Democrat or Republican, who had declined to attend its May 26 debate.</p>
        <p>In a joint appearance with reporters afterward, Mr. Florio continued that line of attack, saying that Mr. Corzine was avoiding the event because it would be the only one broadcast on network television. Mr. Corzine countered by accusing Mr. Florio of using their discussion about debates to distract voters.</p>
        <p>''This is a diversion away from talking about the fundamental issues,'' he said. ''It is way more than the governor debated in any of his other campaigns.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine and Mr. Florio are scheduled to debate twice more -- this Tuesday and Thursday -- before the June 6 primary. But Mr. Florio, whose campaign funds are dwarfed by Mr. Corzine's personal fortune, clearly hopes that such free news media exposure can help him make his case to voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, who is on pace to break all spending records for a Senate primary, has little to gain by venturing into the uncontrolled setting of a debate any more than necessary. Just hours after today's debate,  his campaign began broadcasting one of three new television advertisements featuring Frank R. Lautenberg, who is retiring after 18 years in the Senate and has endorsed Mr. Corzine.</p>
        <p>In any case, it is possible that the debates will have only a restricted effect. Four debates were agreed upon only after months of negotiations, and are confined to broadcast outlets with limited audiences.</p>
        <p>WLIB has a sizable audience in New York but cannot be heard in much of New Jersey. In a curious moment, Kae Thompson, the host of the program, ''Eye on New Jersey,'' asked the candidates whether the station has political influence in New Jersey. Mr. Corzine assured her that both he and Mr. Florio believe that it does.</p>
        <p>But the two candidates agreed on little else.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio accused Mr. Corzine of undermining the Social Security system by backing a plan to invest part of the trust fund in the stock market. Mr. Corzine said his plan was sound and had the backing of President Clinton and his former treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, Mr. Corzine's mentor at Goldman Sachs.</p>
        <p>The most heated exchange came when Mr. Corzine defied Mr. Florio to tell residents of Camden and other distressed cities that the school financing program he enacted while governor, which caused a $2.8 billion tax increase, had improved the quality of their children's education.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio responded by calling Mr. Corzine a ''nay-sayer'' who had spent millions on advertisements attacking Mr. Florio's response to a court-ordered increase in school financing without ever saying how he would have solved the problem himself.</p>
        <p>''Well, governor,'' Mr. Corzine chided, ''that's because you haven't been listening.''</p>
