        <p>YOU never got to play second base for the Yankees, were rejected by Harvard Law, lost $15,000 (and the race) in your 1990 New Jersey Congressional campaign, didn't fulfill that teenage prediction about being a second-term senator by 45.

        <p>YOU never got to play second base for the Yankees, were rejected by Harvard Law, lost $15,000 (and the race) in your 1990 New Jersey Congressional campaign, didn't fulfill that teenage prediction about being a second-term senator by 45. Now you're the Giuliani-appointed chairman of the much-vilified New York City Rent Guidelines Board, and to top things off, you're even having trouble hanging on to your hair.</p>
        <p>Turn around please, Edward S. Hochman, so we can confirm a suspicion that you've had one of those hand-lettered ''Kick Me'' signs stuck to your back since elementary school. No, nothing there.</p>
        <p>What else to think, then, except that it must be some bizarre annual power trip, one Mr. Hochman has taken seven times now, to be able to make millions of New Yorkers despise him, and render some homicidal, with the turn of a single phrase: ''Your rent's going up.''</p>
        <p>Cruel words, those. Particularly when said by a globe-trotting lawyer (his idea of a good time is riding camels and elephants in Nairobi) who owns a one-bedroom co-op on East 57th Street and tosses down $400 a month just to park his car.</p>
        <p>The death threats come and go, the stipend is a measly $150 per diem, the mayor has offered no pats on the back, much less promotion to a nobler post. Tenant advocates on Mr. Hochman's board call him smart but a blabbermouth, a tantrum-prone political puppet who would fall on his sword if City Hall ordered it. Sometimes his own mother casts aspersions on him for presuming to tell New Yorkers, not known as an obsequious bunch, how much it's going to cost to continue to occupy their (rental) castles.</p>
        <p>''She tells me that I'm a burlesque, a disgrace, and that if I had any sense, I'd resign,'' rails Mr. Hochman, a nail-biter. ''If I were an intellectual masochist, it would be difficult to find a more pleasing job at which one could be beaten up,'' he adds, sitting within petting distance of a plush toy lion at the office of one of the less contentious boards he graces, the African Fund for Endangered Wildlife. ''Only in a city like New York, doing rent control, do you judge the success of your job not on how many people you please, but in the fact that you are universally disliked.''</p>
        <p>Last week Mr. Hochman and his board inspired universal hissing with their proposal for the inevitable October rent increase: 4 percent for one-year leases, 6 percent for two-year leases. Tenant advocates accused Mr. Hochman of gouging occupants of the one million apartments under the board's watch. Landlord advocates ranted about being gouged by rising operating costs.</p>
        <p>''When I first came to this board, I thought I was going to be like a U.N. negotiator and bring both sides together,'' he recalls of his initial fantasy. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's operatives offered him the post in 1994 as reward for giving them a hand with campaign strategy. (He says he was also Brooklyn campaign coordinator for Edward I. Koch in 1985.)</p>
        <p>''I guess I didn't give enough of a hand and this is how Rudy's punishing me,'' jokes Mr. Hochman, whose board has a dual goal: to prevent tenant-gouging and ensure landlords a fair return. ''Sounds simple enough on paper, but that's where the screaming comes in.''</p>
        <p>THAT he tends to participate in the screaming has made for some heated extracurricular action. In his first year, furious tenants followed him to the subway and threatened to throw him onto the tracks -- the wind was taken out of their sails when the chastened rookie offered to jump without their help. In his second year, with rents raised 5 and 7 percent, death threats poured onto his answering machine. But after that, his skin thickened, and he stuck around. Why? Perhaps it's those latent political ambitions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hochman, who enjoys a comfortable six-figure income derived from corporate law duties for several manufacturers of salable ''schlock'' (artwork, picture frames, plastics), believes he possesses a social conscience (more housing, conservation, gun control) that belongs in Washington.</p>
        <p>At 47, this wifeless, childless and petless Peter Pan still hopes he can ''have it all.''</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't mind having another public position, appointed or elected: 'Elect me to the Senate and I'll show you what I'll do about rent control!' Or if I could replace Andrew Cuomo at HUD, gee, that would be great.''</p>
        <p>The son of a physician and a nurse in Paterson, N.J., Mr. Hochman was 4 when he plotted his future: asked if he wanted to be a doctor like Dad, he said he wanted to be a lawyer. He was a history major at the University of Vermont, spent two warless years driving Army tanks, and graduated from Georgetown Law. Back in Paterson, he was a clerk for Judge Louis Schwartz of Superior Court, worked on Stephen Wiley's unsuccessful New Jersey gubernatorial bid, then began networking in New York as ''a Koch Democrat.''</p>
        <p>On June 15, Mr. Hochman's board will hold its annual hearing: 900 minutes of complaints from 300 irked renters and landlords. Despite the sob stories, Mr. Hochman guarantees rent increases -- 3 and 5 percent minimum, 5 and 7 percent maximum -- when the board votes on June 22.</p>
        <p>After it's over, he'll go home to his luxury doorman abode and tell himself this: ''You're a good boy, you love your mother, you try and save furry animals, protect the redwoods, so why is everybody angry at you? It's the job, not you.''</p>
