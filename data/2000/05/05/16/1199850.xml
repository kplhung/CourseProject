        <p>Ancient lunar rituals got a technological upgrade in ''Dong Dong Touching the Moons,'' a multimedia piece by Jin Hi Kim presented last week at the Kitchen. Ms. Kim plays the Korean komungo, a zither akin to the Japanese koto, and has devoted much of her career to composing mixed-culture hybrids. ''Dong Dong,'' named after a 15th-century Korean homage to the moon, brought together Korean and Indian musicians and dancers with video images and computer processing, including sensors that allowed a dancer's gesture to send a sound spinning around the room.</p>
        <p>Despite the elaborate underpinnings, the performance seen on Thursday was spare and ritualistic. Each of six segments was dedicated to a certain planet's moon or moons, invoking astronomical observations and myth. The digital images, by Tennessee Rice Dixon, were full of circles: moon shapes, cycles, solar-system diagrams, mandalas.</p>
        <p>To suggest Saturn's rings and fast-moving moons, an Indian kathak dancer, Parul Shah, twirled across the stage to plucked, accelerating, echo-processed komungo notes and Samir Chatterjee's tabla drumming. Making offerings of rock and ice to Uranus's moons, Ms. Shah and a Korean dancer, Sin Cha Hong, rolled a boulder and a translucent glass disc across the stage; with motion-sensor gloves, Ms. Shah triggered gusts of white noise. For Earth's moon, Ms. Kim played a Korean changgo drum lighted from within, with its phase slowly changing.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kim's austere music centered the work. She had Kwon Soon Kang, a singer in the Korean kagok tradition, avoid traditional melodies and apply the techniques of ''living tone'' to sustained notes: filling them with vibrato, tightening them until they broke, using glottal stops to make them ripple like waves around a rock. With her electric komungo, she floated sustained tones and rudimentary melodies or plucked twangs suggesting a jaw-harp or hinted at the bent notes of the blues. And with Alex Noyes's digital processing, she turned Korean court-orchestra music into a haze of distant fanfares and remembered rites, from a time when the moon was a divine power.</p>
