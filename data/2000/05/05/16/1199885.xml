        <p>The United States weighed a plan to detonate a nuclear bomb on the moon as a show of military and technical strength during the feverish post-Sputnik days of the cold war, a physicist involved in the plan said.</p>
        <p>The physicist, Leonard Reiffel, 72, said yesterday that he was in charge of a highly classified study of the blast's visibility, its possible science benefits and its effects on the moon's face.

        <p>The United States weighed a plan to detonate a nuclear bomb on the moon as a show of military and technical strength during the feverish post-Sputnik days of the cold war, a physicist involved in the plan said.</p>
        <p>The physicist, Leonard Reiffel, 72, said yesterday that he was in charge of a highly classified study of the blast's visibility, its possible science benefits and its effects on the moon's face. His research got under way in 1958, sponsored by the Air Force special weapons center in Albuquerque, and involved up to 10 people on his staff, including Carl Sagan, then a young astronomer and later a famous popularizer of science.</p>
        <p>''The foremost intent was to impress the world with the prowess of the United States,'' Dr. Reiffel said in an interview. ''It was a P.R. device, without question, in the minds of the people from the Air Force.''</p>
        <p>The nuclear flash would have been widely visible from Earth, he said, and would have produced a lunar crater and dust cloud that, because of the moon's lack of atmosphere, would have flown out in all directions rather than in the usual mushroom shape.</p>
        <p>Dr. Reiffel said the plan called for an explosive device about the size of the atomic bomb that leveled Hiroshima. The Air Force ruled out a hydrogen bomb, he said, because of the difficulty of flying the heavier weapon 235,000 miles to the moon.</p>
        <p>He said the project ended when Air Force officials decided its risks outweighed its benefits. A spokesman said the Air Force would not comment until it could review records.</p>
        <p>Dr. Reiffel said the Air Force plan was seen as a way to bolster national confidence after the Soviet Union launched the world's first satellite, Sputnik, into orbit in October 1957.</p>
        <p>The United States had a hard time catching up, exploding many rockets and succeeding in orbiting a satellite in January 1958 that weighed just 10.5 pounds. National esteem was low for years, because much of the world assumed that the Soviets could launch a nuclear weapon at the United States but that the United States was unable to reply.</p>
        <p>Dr. Reiffel said his research was done at the Armour Research Foundation in Chicago, which did work for the Air Force and is now part of the Illinois Institute of Technology. He was the head of physics for the foundation and also led the secret study.</p>
        <p>From May 1958 to January 1959, his team reported on blast considerations and likely effects, Dr. Reiffel said, including the visual differences if the moon's face was illuminated by the sun or darkened in shadow.</p>
        <p>Dr. Reiffel made his role in the project public in a letter in the May 4 issue of the journal Nature. The letter addressed the bomb study and Dr. Sagan's role. He said he had Dr. Sagan investigate whether the blast could be used to identify the presence of organic molecules on the moon.</p>
        <p>In 1959, the Soviet Union became the first nation to crash a probe into the moon. After several failures, the United States did so in 1962.</p>
        <p>Dr. Reiffel said his team had no responsibility for the project's moon rocket. But it was to have been an Air Force intercontinental ballistic missile, he said, which had enough range. The United States began deploying ICBM's in October 1959.</p>
        <p>''As these things go, this was small,'' Dr. Reiffel said of the bomb project. ''It was less than a year and never got to the point of operational planning. We showed what some of the effects might be. But the real argument we made, and others made behind closed doors, was that there was no point in ruining the pristine environment of the moon. There were other ways to impress the public that we were not about to be overwhelmed by the Russians.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Reiffel said he worked with the physicist Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago and later was a deputy director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration during the early Apollo program.</p>
        <p>Dr. Reiffel's letter was in response to a review of ''Carl Sagan: A Life'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999) by Keay Davidson, which sketched out some of Dr. Sagan's involvement in the bomb project. The book said Dr. Sagan had broken security in March 1959 to inform a potential patron about the secret work, but a reviewer disparaged that finding. However, Dr. Reiffel agreed with the author.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to set the record straight,'' Dr. Reiffel said. ''There would have been an outcry if the project had been made public.''</p>
