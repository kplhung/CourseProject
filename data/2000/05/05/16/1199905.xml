        <p>Stepping up the pressure on a reluctant takeover target, the co-chairman of Unilever said yesterday that he thought the $66-a-share offer made earlier this month for Bestfoods was ''serious money'' and that the company wants the management of Bestfoods to meet with Unilever to discuss it.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the prospect of the sale of Nabisco Group Holdings to another food company, like Groupe Danone or Philip Morris, intensified the focus on a Unilever-Bestfoods combination.</p>
        <p>Merging Nabisco with either Groupe Danone or Philip Morris would create a global packaged-food giant that could leave Bestfoods behind, one analyst said. ''Some powerhouses are being built,'' said the analyst, John R. McMillin of Prudential Securities. ''Where does that put Bestfoods?''</p>
        <p>In an interview, Antony Burgmans, the co-chairman of Unilever, drew parallels between his company's pursuit of Bestfoods and its recent successful acquisition of Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade. ''We have respect for the company with whom we are negotiating, respect for the brands and respect for the work they have done,'' Mr. Burgmans said. ''In the end, that is why we were able to convince Ben and Jerry to sit at the table with us.''</p>
        <p>As for Bestfoods, he added: ''What puzzles and amazes us is that at that price, a premium of 34 percent over what the stock was trading for, they haven't come up to talk to us.''</p>
        <p>But Bestfoods, at least publicly, is not budging from the position it took earlier this month that the offer, worth $18.4 billion, is too low. ''Our board of directors firmly and unanimously rejected Unilever's offer of $66 per share as financially inadequate,'' said Gale Griffin, a company spokeswoman. ''Nothing has changed since then. The Unilever proposal was quite clear. If they have further communications about value, they have the ability to communicate with us.''</p>
        <p>Some analysts say they expect Unilever, which makes foods like Breyer's ice cream and Lipton tea and household products like Dove soap, to prevail. In a presentation at a conference sponsored by Goldman, Sachs yesterday, Unilever's other co-chairman, Niall FitzGerald, also expressed bewilderment that Bestfoods executives had not asked to meet to discuss the proposal. ''We fail to understand why Bestfoods management will not engage in face-to-face discussions,'' Mr. FitzGerald told the group, which Charles R. Shoemate, the chairman and chief executive of Bestfoods, addressed later in the day. ''Consolidation is inevitable in the food industry.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burgmans said Unilever wanted to take over not just the Bestfoods brands, which include Hellmann's mayonnaise, Knorr soups and Skippy peanut butter, but also the management. ''We know this management well,'' he said. ''Their people would have leading responsibilities in the new structure.'' The president of Unilever's North American food business, Richard Goldstein, is leaving Unilever at the end of the month, and no successor has been named.</p>
        <p>If the merger went through, Knorr would become Unilever's biggest brand, Mr. FitzGerald told investors, and Hellmann's would be the third or fourth largest. Adding huge brands like those would speed up Unilever's disposal of smaller brands, making the strategy that Unilever announced in February go into effect faster.</p>
        <p>''We have been preparing our business case for the last 12 months,'' Mr. FitzGerald said. ''We believe we can execute the integration program with relatively low risk.''</p>
        <p>In some cases where the two companies have overlapping operations, Unilever's business would be folded into that of Bestfoods, Mr. Burgmans said. ''They are very strong in food service and we are weaker,'' he said. ''We would fold our food service unit into theirs. In the U.S., we would become a powerhouse. In Latin America, Unilever is strong but not in foods. They are not so strong in Asia, but at a single stroke, we could have them in a million shops.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McMillin said that Unilever's purchase of Ben &amp; Jerry's for $326 million and Slim-Fast Food Companies for $2.4 billion, both announced on April 12, may have given Bestfoods the impression that Unilever had done all its acquiring for the year. ''I think they were surprised to see Unilever bidding so quickly again,'' he said. ''They were breathing a sigh of relief, and then were caught by surprise.''</p>
