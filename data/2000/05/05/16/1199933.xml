        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Once again, the State Department recommends solving its organizational, leadership and intelligence problems by expanding its reach rather than looking inward (''State Dept. Faults U.S. Aid for War Refugees as Inept,'' news article, May 9).</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, none of the deficiencies outlined in the department's report lie with the United States Agency for International Development's Bureau of Humanitarian Response or Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance.  As the report notes, A.I.D.'s disaster unit is recognized as the world's premier emergency response mechanism. Instead, the report faults leadership in multilateral assistance, State Department policy direction and action, intelligence gathering and interagency coordination.</p>
        <p>Emergency relief can only be hurt by throwing it into the daily mix of politics and diplomacy at the State Department.</p>
