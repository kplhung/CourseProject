        <p>BRITAIN: MRS. BLAIR SUES  Prime Minister Tony Blair's wife, Cherie, who is to give birth to the couple's fourth child this month, will go to court today to challenge a government restriction on who is covered by a provision permitting parents to take 13 weeks of unpaid leave to care for newborn children. Mrs. Blair, 45, a prominent lawyer, is representing the Trades Union Congress in arguing that limiting the new benefit to parents of babies born or adopted after last Dec. 15 unfairly excludes 2.7 million working parents.</p>

        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: INSPECTORS ARRIVE  Cyril Ramaphosa, former general secretary of South Africa's African National Congress, left, and Martti Ahtisaari, former prime minister of Finland, met Prime Minister Tony Blair in London and Northern Ireland's political leaders in Belfast to discuss their coming mission to inspect Irish Republican Army weapon dumps. The inspections are aimed at ending a deadlock over paramilitary disarmament and restoring the power-sharing government in Belfast next week.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: DIANA APPEAL  A Paris court has set Sept. 15 for hearing an appeal on whether to reopen an inquiry into the car crash that killed Diana, the Princess of Wales, and two others in 1997. Prosecutors dropped manslaughter and other charges against photographers pursuing her car after investigating magistrates blamed the driver, Henri Paul, for the accident. Lawyers for Mohammed al-Fayed, whose son, known as Dodi, was also killed, immediately appealed. Mr. Paul was employed by Mr. al-Fayed.</p>

        <p>KOSOVO: SERB'S TRIAL ADJOURNED  The first war crimes case in Kosovo opened in eastern Kosovo when a Serb accused of genocide, Milos Jukic, 21, appeared before ethnic Albanian judges. The trial was adjourned until June 20 after Serbian defense lawyers failed to appear. They have requested that the case be transferred to a planned war crimes court.</p>

        <p>GREECE: UPROAR OVER I.D. CARDS  Despite angry objections by the powerful Orthodox Church, national identification cards will no longer identify the holder's religion, the Justice Ministry said. The holder's thumbprints, profession, nationality and spouse's name will also be excluded from millions of cards to be issued next month. An angered Archbishop Christodoulos, head of the church, called for a referendum on the issue, saying the church was under attack by ''rabid hounds intent on rending its flesh.''</p>

        <p>MEXICO: MAYORAL CANDIDATE BACKED  In an unofficial plebiscite, hundreds of thousands of Mexico City residents cast ballots supporting the leading mayoral candidate's right to stand for election despite challenges by rivals to his residency status. Recent polls showed that Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had pulled ahead of his nearest rival by at least 10 percentage points. A court is to rule soon on a suit arguing he has not lived five years in Mexico City, as required by law.</p>

        <p>ZIMBABWE: VOTE DATES SET  Zimbabwe will hold parliamentary elections June 24-25, the government announced, setting up a contest that poses the biggest challenge so far to President Robert Mugabe's 20-year grip on power. The elections will pit Mr. Mugabe's party against the Movement for Democratic Change in a climate of political violence and a wave of takeovers of white-owned farms by black squatters.</p>

        <p>KASHMIR: MINE KILLS 5  Five men were killed when their bulletproof car ran over a land mine.

        <p>INDONESIA: SUHARTO QUIZZED  After doctors said he was healthy enough to be interrogated, prosecutors questioned former President Suharto at his home about charges of corruption during his 32 years in power. Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said investigators would resume questioning him twice a week.</p>

        <p>CHINA: TRADE TALKS  Chinese and European negotiators resumed talks in Beijing on China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Pascal Lamy, the European Union's trade commissioner, met Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng, left, and said the talks would continue today. The 15-nation union is the most important of seven remaining W.T.O. members that must agree on terms of China's membership before it can join the organization, which sets global trade rules.</p>

        <p>NEPAL: CHILD SOLDIERS  A four-day conference seeking an end to child recruitment in armies began in Katmandu, with a warning from the United Nations commissioner for human rights, Mary Robinson, that children were being traumatized for life. The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers estimates 300,000 children are fighting for national and guerrilla armies.</p>

        <p>SYRIA: EX-PREMIER'S ASSETS FROZEN  In a high-profile effort to demonstrate the government's anti-corruption drive, the assets of former Prime Minister Mahmoud al-Zohbi were frozen in connection with an investigation of his possible misuse of public funds, the governing Baath Party's newspaper reported. Mr. al-Zohbi was prime minister for 13 years until he was abruptly replaced two months ago. The new government has pledged to root out corruption.</p>
