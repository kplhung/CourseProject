        <p>NBC plans to shake up its fall schedule on both mornings and evenings. The network announced its new prime-time schedule yesterday and disclosed plans to expand its 48-year-old ''Today'' program from two hours to three.</p>
        <p>Starting in the fall ''Today,'' which begins at 7 a.m., will continue until 10 a.m., the first time a network morning program has regularly gone past 9.</p>
        <p>NBC plans to add seven prime-time shows, a move that restructures its vaunted Thursday night and excises a long list of disappointing performers at various points this season, including the comedies ''Jesse,'' ''Veronica's Closet,'' ''Stark Raving Mad'' and ''Suddenly Susan,'' which all failed despite prime positions around NBC hit shows on Thursday.</p>
        <p>The network will move one of its Thursday stalwarts, ''Frasier,'' to Tuesday, and shift two newer comedies, ''Will and Grace'' and ''Just Shoot Me,'' in an effort to refashion the night into television's strongest.</p>
        <p>''Today'' has always been the strongest morning program, and in recent years the biggest moneymaker in television. Expanding the program ends the spinoff ''Later Today,'' which did not perform well and is being reduced to a syndicated program to be shown at 10 a.m. on television stations owned by NBC.</p>
        <p>The ''Today'' cast members will continue on the expanded edition, which will also be under the executive producer Jeff Zucker. Mr. Zucker said that in the last six years increases in local and network commercials had reduced the program's daily content by about 10 minutes, leaving him wishing every day that he had more air time.</p>
        <p>Andrew Lack, the president of NBC News, said that the network had been looking for something new for ''Today'' since the program moved to its ground-floor glassed-in studio at Rockefeller Center in 1994.</p>
        <p>The extra hour may pressure NBC's morning competitors to expand, though none of them have network programming time from 9 to 10 a.m. as NBC does.</p>
        <p>NBC added four comedies and three dramas to its prime-time schedule for the fall. The most prominent is ''The Michael Richards Show,'' which brings back the actor who played Kramer on ''Seinfeld,'' this time as a bumbling detective. NBC said it would redo much of the show's pilot, however, because only Mr. Richards stood out among the cast members.</p>
        <p>Another former NBC star, Steven Weber of the sitcom ''Wings,'' will return in a show featuring his name. He will play a businessman whose life takes a wacky turn when a bad blind date puts a hex on him.</p>
        <p>The former Fox star David Alan Grier also will lead a new comedy, ''D.A.G.,'' in which he plays a Secret Service agent demoted from covering the president to guarding the first lady, played by Delta Burke.</p>
        <p>The fourth comedy is ''Tucker,'' about a teenager and his mother who are forced to live with a harpylike aunt.</p>
        <p>The dramas are headed by ''Deadline,'' the latest from the executive producer Dick Wolf of ''Law and Order'' fame. This one stars Oliver Platt as an investigative reporter in New York.</p>
        <p>''Titans'' brings the producer Aaron Spelling back to splashy serial drama with a tale about a rich Beverly Hills family. The cast include Victoria Principal of ''Dallas'' and Yasmine Bleeth of ''Baywatch.''</p>
        <p>The last drama is a quirky tale of small town life called ''Ed,'' created by Rob Burnett, the longtime writer and producer of David Letterman's late-night shows. It is about a lawyer who loses his job and wife and moves back to his hometown, Stuckeyville. It stars Tom Cavanaugh.</p>
        <p>NBC is dropping two nights of its five-night-a-week newsmagazine, ''Dateline.''</p>
        <p>This is the full NBC prime-time schedule:</p>
        <p>MONDAY:  ''Daddio,'' ''Third Rock From the Sun,'' ''Deadline,'' ''Third Watch.''</p>
        <p>TUESDAY:  ''The Michael Richards Show,'' ''Tucker,'' ''Frasier,'' ''D.A.G.,'' ''Dateline.''</p>
        <p>WEDNESDAY:  ''Titans,'' ''The West Wing,'' ''Law and Order.''</p>
        <p>THURSDAY:  ''Friends,'' ''The Steven Weber Show,'' ''Will and Grace,'' ''Just Shoot Me,'' ''E.R.''</p>
        <p>FRIDAY:  ''Providence,'' ''Dateline,'' ''Law and Order: S.V.U.''</p>
        <p>SATURDAY:  Movies.</p>
        <p>SUNDAY:  ''Dateline,'' ''Ed,'' movies.</p>
