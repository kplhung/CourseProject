        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The column ''The Demise of Reflective Doctoring'' (May 9) accurately describes the sad direction doctors are being forced to take by the need for fiscal stability.</p>
        <p>This dangerous situation pervades both the university and the community. Solo practitioners and groups that would ordinarily spend quality time with patients must now spend it on increasing volume, filing forms and deciphering the coding.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The column ''The Demise of Reflective Doctoring'' (May 9) accurately describes the sad direction doctors are being forced to take by the need for fiscal stability.</p>
        <p>This dangerous situation pervades both the university and the community. Solo practitioners and groups that would ordinarily spend quality time with patients must now spend it on increasing volume, filing forms and deciphering the coding.</p>
        <p>The traits of the ''clinical champions'' that the authors feel are required to halt this downward spiral are indigenous in most medical students, but the realities of the economic environment, the predominance of poor role modeling and the need now to scramble for a living are causes for even the most optimistic of us to become cynical in thinking that any of our wishes will be achieved until such time that the practice of medicine is restored to its original luster.</p>

        <p>The writer is a vascular surgeon.</p>
