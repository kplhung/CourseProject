        <p>There was a time when George Steinbrenner would have reacted decisively to a four-game losing streak. He might have ordered a trade, a demotion or a firing. He might have waded into a band of reporters and blistered a slumping player.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner is more circumspect now, after more than a quarter-century as principal owner of the Yankees. He is generally upbeat about the team's record, he said yesterday, adding that it is too early in the year to make changes. But he is also aware of those who are meeting expectations, and those who are not.</p>
        <p>''I'm not seeing some things I'd like to see,'' he said. ''I'm not happy with the way some of our guys are playing. I'm not going to get into naming specific people, but they know who they are.</p>
        <p>''This is a good ball club. I will be concerned if they don't start playing better. I'm not happy with what went on, but I hope that it will wake up some of our people.''</p>
        <p>What went on last weekend, of course, was that the last-place Detroit Tigers swept three games from the Yankees, knocking the Yankees out of first place in the American League East and driving them deeper into an offensive funk. The Yankees, nonetheless, have a record of 22-13 -- over a full season, that winning percentage would translate into 102 victories -- and it would seem inevitable that slumping players like Derek Jeter and Chuck Knoblauch will eventually emerge, Jeter after he comes back from a strained abdominal muscle next week.</p>
        <p>''I'm not worried -- not quite yet,'' Steinbrenner said. ''Not in the middle of May. This is a long season.''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner deflected questions about specific changes by mentioning obliquely: ''We had some ideas in the winter. Unfortunately, we didn't make those moves.''</p>
        <p>He would not elaborate, but the most notable deal the Yankees discussed in spring training was for Jim Edmonds, the outfielder who is at the top of almost all primary offensive categories in the National League. The Yankees could have traded for Edmonds if they had been willing to part with either Alfonso Soriano, their best Class AAA infield prospect, or reliever Ramiro Mendoza and outfielder Ricky Ledee.</p>
        <p>Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, argued vehemently to keep Soriano, mainly so they would be able to use him as a bargaining chip whenever a front-line pitcher became available, such as Minnesota's Brad Radke. The Yankees could win without improving their offense, Cashman argued, supported by Manager Joe Torre and others.</p>
        <p>Torre stated his preference to keep Mendoza, having seen how valuable the right-hander had been to the Yankees in recent years. There were a handful of club officials, including Cashman, who pushed to give Ledee a chance as the everyday left fielder; Ledee led the team in home runs in spring training and looked great, and Anaheim traded Edmonds to St. Louis.</p>
        <p>But now Ledee is batting .217 with one home run and nine runs batted in and has not realized the potential others see in him. It stands to reason that with the club slumping, Ledee is entering a crucial period of evaluation. As long as the team is winning, the success buys time for struggling players like Ledee, and now the Yankees are in a losing streak.</p>
        <p>If changes are made later in the season -- and Steinbrenner is clearly monitoring the team -- then there are a handful of quality hitters who may be available in trade. The Yankees have discussed possible deals for Oakland's Matt Stairs and Montreal's Rondell White, and could pursue the likes of Minnesota's Matt Lawton. General managers in both leagues said last week that some teams are beginning to reach the point where they are ready to make changes and deals.</p>
        <p>Ledee might have the worst numbers on a team ranked next to last in runs scored in the league, but the Yankees thrived last year without much production from their left fielders or their catchers. Paul O'Neill is hitting .299, Bernie Williams .308, Tino Martinez .290 and Jorge Posada .345.</p>
        <p>A major difference has been the diminished production of the first and second hitters in the lineup, Knoblauch and Jeter. Last year, they had a combined on-base percentage of .415. This year: .304. In the first 35 games of the 1999 season, Knoblauch and Jeter reached base in the same inning 30 times in the first 35 games; this year, that has happened 14 times.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch and Jeter had 83 hits and 39 walks in the first 35 games of last season. This year: 58 hits and 19 walks. They averaged 1 walk for every 8.2 plate appearances last year, second best in baseball; this year they are averaging 1 for 14.5 plate appearances, the fourth worst in the majors. They have scored 27 percent fewer runs than at the same point in the season last year; the Yankees' collective scoring is down 12 percent.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch has five walks, his last coming April 18. He noted after Sunday's loss that he continues to take a strike in the vast majority of his at-bats. His plan at the plate is the same. (Knoblauch has swung at the first pitch in 14 of his at-bats, without getting a hit.) He simply is not getting the same results.</p>
        <p>''If you have a track record of what you can do,'' Knoblauch said, ''I firmly believe that at the end of the year, you'll have done the job if you stay healthy and if you stay healthy and stick with your plan, and I'm certainly planning on staying healthy and I'm definitely sticking with my plan.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch and Jeter, Torre said before Saturday's game, ''are huge for us.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''They led everybody in on-base percentage, and that's such an edge for our club to have that combo working for you. And we really haven't had it all year.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch was a binge offensive player in his first two seasons for the Yankees, following slumps with bursts of production. It figures to be only a matter of time before Jeter hits, Torre mentioned the other day.</p>
        <p>Jeter thinks it is a good sign the team has a good record in spite of the lack of offense. ''Except for the last four games, we've been able to find some ways to win,'' Jeter said. ''Sooner or later it's going to turn around and we're going to start scoring some runs. Hopefully, it's sooner than later.''</p>
        <p>That would placate the team owner, for the time being. Advisers have told Steinbrenner that this team is good enough to win a championship, he said. ''Three out of the last four they've won,'' Steinbrenner said. ''How can you vote against them?''</p>
