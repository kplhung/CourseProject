        <p>GOLFMAN-Dr. Arnold W., of Bay Shore passed away at home on May 13, 2000 after a long illness. He was 81. Beloved husband of Joan. Devoted father and stepfather of Sheila Ackerman, Robert Golfman and Michael and Steven Glass. Loving grandfather of Evan &amp; Colin Ackerman, Peter, Catherine Casey and Jessica Ann Glass. Dear brother of Lillian Starr and Sidney Golfman, M.D. Born in Canada, Dr. Golfman graduated from St. Georges Hospital Medical School, London, England in 1946. After 2 years as the only physician providing care to several Canadian Indian tribes by flying himself to their reservations, Dr. Golfman went on to specialized training in pathology. Upon completion of his studies, he began his career as a pathologist in the United States. In 1959, Dr. Golfman was asked to oversee all aspects of the building and development of the laboratory at the new Diocesan hospital being built in West Islip. When Good Samaritan Hospital opened later that year, the Pathology Department was indeed ready to serve both pysicians and patients with Dr. Golfman as the Director, a position in which he happily served for the next 25 years. An accomplished aviator, sailor, skier &amp; woodworker; Dr. Golfman will best be remembered by friends &amp; colleagues for his intellectual curiosity, professional integrity &amp; the respect with which he treated all who crossed his path. The family will receive visitors at Fredrick J. Chapey &amp; Sons West Islip Funeral Home, 1225 Montauk Hway, (1/4 mile west of the Robert Moses Cswy), Thursday, May 18, 2000 between 3-7 P.M. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center, 1000 Montauk Highway, West Islip, New York 11795</p>
