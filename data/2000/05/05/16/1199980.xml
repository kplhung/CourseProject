        <p>Letter from Michael J Hurd, psychologist, says 'feel good' marches like Million Mom March do not address the real point, which is not how to outlaw guns, but why so many young people want to pull trigger in first place</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Feel good'' marches like the Million Mom March serve no constructive purpose (front page, May 15). In fact, the Million Mom March helped us evade the fact that fewer parents are doing a good job raising their children. It's the gun manufacturers! they scream. What about the parents who leave guns out for their children to take? Or the ''self-esteem'' obsessed schools, which teach children to go with their feelings instead of learning self-restraint?</p>

        <p>Take it from a psychologist who sees, daily, the growing problems of  young people firsthand. The real issue is not how we can outlaw guns. The real issue is why so many people, including young people, want to pull the trigger in the first place.</p>
