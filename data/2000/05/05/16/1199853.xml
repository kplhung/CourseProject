        <p>America has always been in love with utopias. The trouble with earthly paradises, however, is that they end up being run by mortals. In John Guare's haunting and humorous two-play series, ''Lydie Breeze,'' which opened last night at the New York Theater Workshop, the utopians are a Civil War nurse, Lydie, and three soldiers whose lives she helped save. She has lured them to Nantucket with a siren song of ''I know an island,'' and the four have set up a commune devoted to the transcendental life.</p>
        <p>But lapping at the shores of any utopian island is an outside world with money, lust, greed, jealousy, revenge. Taken together, the two plays form a sort of surreal saga with an overlay of 19th-century melodrama. At their heart they are allegorical meditations on the contradictions of life -- the interconnectedness of all things (a subject Mr. Guare explored in ''Six Degrees of Separation'') and the chaotic nature of the universe (which he examined in ''House of Blue Leaves'' and other works).</p>

        <p>America has always been in love with utopias. The trouble with earthly paradises, however, is that they end up being run by mortals. In John Guare's haunting and humorous two-play series, ''Lydie Breeze,'' which opened last night at the New York Theater Workshop, the utopians are a Civil War nurse, Lydie, and three soldiers whose lives she helped save. She has lured them to Nantucket with a siren song of ''I know an island,'' and the four have set up a commune devoted to the transcendental life.</p>
        <p>But lapping at the shores of any utopian island is an outside world with money, lust, greed, jealousy, revenge. Taken together, the two plays form a sort of surreal saga with an overlay of 19th-century melodrama. At their heart they are allegorical meditations on the contradictions of life -- the interconnectedness of all things (a subject Mr. Guare explored in ''Six Degrees of Separation'') and the chaotic nature of the universe (which he examined in ''House of Blue Leaves'' and other works).</p>
        <p>The texts for these ruminations come in the opening tableau as one member of the commune recites Whitman's poem ''On the Beach at Night Alone,'' which treats the ''vast similitude'' of all things, and another ponders the account of the world's origins from ''Bulfinch's Mythology,'' which asserts that before there was heaven and earth and sea there was only chaos. By the end of the five-hour cycle, the only question is whether we are moving away from or back toward that confused state.</p>
        <p>This production of ''Lydie Breeze'' is Mr. Guare's reworking of two plays, first staged in 1982, that were part of a planned tetralogy. The new versions are made more accessible than the originals by presenting events in narrative chronology and by expanding the character of Lydie.</p>
        <p>An undercurrent of the two plays is how humans change over the course of a lifetime without even noticing. How, for example, a nurse can turn into a killer or two war comrades can fight to the death over a soft drink. As Lydie says at one point: ''Anything can happen. That is the most horrid thing about living.'' Or as the last member of the commune puts it, ''We all ruined one another's lives.'' At the start of the opening play, ''Bulfinch's Mythology,'' this menage a quatre has been living on the commune, which they have named Aipotu (yes, that's utopia spelled backward; imagination was not their strong suit), for seven years. But neither man nor woman can live by noble thoughts alone, and a lack of money has only increased the growing discord that has crept in. The commune has become becalmed. ''Walden was a Wild West show compared to us,'' one observes. On top of it all, the cow has run away.</p>
        <p>Lydie (Elizabeth Marvel) has married one of the men, a would-be writer named Joshua Hickman (Bill Camp), with whom she has had a daughter. But her true love is Dan Grady (Matt Servitto), who has taken a job as a railroad conductor to bring in some cash.</p>
        <p>The third man is Amos Mason (Boris McGiver), a sort of commune jester, or at least the butt of the others' jokes. Relegated to minding the baby and doing the fishing, Amos is angered by Lydie's suggestion they take in summer boarders to earn money. ''First I'm the nanny and now I'm supposed to be a bellhop,'' he complains. ''I came to this island to be transcendental.''</p>
        <p>Joshua is also unhappy. After working for seven years on a novel, he has just received a dismissive rejection from William Dean Howells. But it is Dan, the railroad man, who brings back the real seeds of disaster that will infect the lives of the dreamers and their children forever.</p>
        <p>Mr. Guare is a master at exploring life's ironies, and Dan's return with a Gladstone bag full of cash that he took from a murder scene aboard a train at first seems a godsend. The money will provide Joshua with the wherewithal to tour Europe to get material for a novel, allow Amos to go to Harvard Law School and leave Dan alone with Lydie on Nantucket.</p>
        <p>But anytime mammon sneaks into paradise, there is bound to be trouble. Just how much trouble becomes apparent in a riveting second act that jumps nine years forward and finds Joshua in prison for killing Dan. While in jail Joshua has written a novel about the commune, and this time Howells is eager to publish it. But Amos, now a successful lawyer with political ambitions, visits Joshua in prison and offers to get him a pardon if he refuses. What price freedom?</p>
        <p>The second play, called ''The Sacredness of the Next Task,'' moves forward 11 years and finds Joshua the lone original commune member on Nantucket. Lydie committed suicide some years earlier; her elder daughter, Gussie (saucily played by Alexandra Oliver), is pursuing a life of champagne-and-yacht privilege in Washington; her younger daughter, also named Lydie Breeze (Alicia Goranson), is facing the onset of puberty with only Beaty (Joanna P. Adler), an Irish nanny who is slowly going mad, as a surrogate mother.</p>
        <p>Soon the full measure of the affliction Dan Grady brought back to Aipotu becomes apparent. On one of his train trips he caught syphilis and passed it on to Lydie. The chain of infection, of course, does not end there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Guare is one of the most erudite writers, and the two plays abound in literary, political and philosophical references to the post-Civil War era, some of which the playwright, ever the tour guide, can't help explaining. But one needn't be a historian to draw parallels between the America of the late 19th century and that of the late 20th century. And through it all runs Mr. Guare's wonderfully absurd humor, which can pop up at the most unexpected moments, and a poetic sense of language that often takes one by surprise.</p>
        <p>Itamar Kubovy has directed a solid cast that keeps the story flowing. Ms. Marvel is a genuine free spirit as Lydie, the fire of her fantasy still flashing in her eyes even when life has given her some wrong turns. Mr. Camp is no less a conflicted soul as Joshua and makes seamless transitions from a young dreamer to an older, besotted cynic.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGiver, Mr. Servitto and Ms. Adler all turn in credible performances, and Jefferson Mays delivers a fine turn as Jeremiah Grady, the grown son of Dan, who appears on Nantucket as a sort of Nemesis looking for atonement. Neil Patel's windswept beach of a set and Brian MacDevitt's lighting, especially scenes in which he plays silhouettes off the backstage wall, evoke the forlorness of utopia.</p>
