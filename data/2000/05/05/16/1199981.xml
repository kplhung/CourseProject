        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Mothers Rally to Assail Gun Violence'' (front page, May 15): The National Rifle Association argues effectively but disingenuously that we have enough gun control laws to reduce the associated violence and increase safety. We merely need to enforce existing laws, the N.R.A. says. But it knows that increasing the legal and control apparatus for effective enforcement is expensive and difficult. It's a clever argument.</p>

        <p>The clear response must be that we want cost-effective gun control laws. For example, why not treat would-be gun owners and guns just as we do drivers and their vehicles? Driving is potentially dangerous, and the proficiency testing, paperwork, inspections and safety controls are accepted. Does the Second Amendment guarantee the right to bear arms without regulation?</p>
