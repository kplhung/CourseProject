        <p>Three large new studies are challenging the safety and benefits of clot-busting drugs for older people suffering heart attacks, particularly those 75 and older.</p>
        <p>The drugs fail to benefit many such heart attack patients, and those 75 and older may be at higher risk of death from bleeding, strokes and ruptured hearts, two of the studies found.</p>
        <p>The findings are surprising because of a widespread belief that clot-busting drugs help older patients just as they clearly do younger ones.</p>
        <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommend use of clot-busting drugs in heart attack patients. But the two leading heart organizations caution that evidence for the drugs' effectiveness and safety in older people has been equivocal. The two main clot-busting drugs, also known as thrombolytics, are T.P.A. (tissue plasminogen activator) and streptokinase.</p>
        <p>About a million Americans suffer heart attacks each year, and about one-third of them occur in people 75 and older.</p>
        <p>Now an urgent need exists to reassess the recommendations for treating heart attacks in older people, particularly because the number of heart attacks in people over 75 is growing rapidly as the population ages, said the researchers from Harvard, Johns Hopkins and Yale who led the studies. The same point was stressed in an editorial in the journal Circulation, which is publishing the Johns Hopkins study today.</p>
        <p>Clot-buster drugs are major weapons in the emergency treatment of heart attacks. If injected intravenously within 12 hours after a heart attack, the drugs can dissolve the blood clots that form in coronary arteries that were previously narrowed by arteriosclerosis. The clots stop the flow of blood carrying oxygen and other nutrients, leading to death of heart muscle cells.</p>
        <p>New studies are needed to directly compare clot-busting drugs and other therapies like angioplasty in people 75 and older, the researchers said. (Angioplasty is a procedure in which a tube with a balloon on its tip is guided to a blocked coronary artery to widen it.)</p>
        <p>But such studies are difficult to conduct. One study had to be stopped several years ago because too many doctors were unwilling to recommend that their elderly heart attack patients enter a study in which the choice of treatment -- a clot-busting drug or a placebo -- was made by a flip of the coin.</p>
        <p>The new findings have particular relevance for patient care because they are based on actual practice and not from clinical trials on selected patients, the researchers said. Doctors in practice do not always adhere to the rigorous scientific blueprints used in clinical trials. Also, such studies tend to select healthier and younger patients.</p>
        <p>Both the Johns Hopkins and Yale researchers based their studies on information from the federal Medicare health insurance program, but analyzed it by different methods. The Harvard researchers studied medical practice in Minnesota.</p>
        <p>The findings were similar, but differed in certain ways.</p>
        <p>The Johns Hopkins study involved 7,864 Medicare patients aged 65 to 86, and it measured outcomes 30 days after patients received clot-busting drugs or no therapy. It found that the benefits of clot-busting drugs varied markedly with age.</p>
        <p>Researchers calculated that heart attack patients from 76 to 86 who received clot-busting drugs were 38 percent more likely to die within 30 days of treatment than their counterparts who were not given the medications. The death rate for patients treated with clot-busting drugs was 18 percent, compared with 15.4 percent for patients who did not get them.</p>
        <p>Among patients from 65 to 75, the pattern was reversed: those who received clot-busting therapy had a 30-day death rate of 6.8 percent, compared with 9.8 percent for patients who did not get the drugs. ''What was surprising was not only the lack of benefit but also that actually there was harm,'' said Dr. Neil R. Powe, a co-author of the Johns Hopkins study.</p>
        <p>The Harvard study also showed an increased risk of death among heart attack patients older than 75 who received clot-busting drugs. They were treated at 37 community hospitals that had 80 percent of the acute care beds in Minnesota.</p>
        <p>Of 289 patients older than 75 who received the clot-busting drugs, 58, or 20.1 percent, died. This compared with 204 deaths among the 1,239, or 16.5 percent, of those who did not receive the drug therapy, Dr. Stephen B. Soumerai, a drug policy researcher at Harvard Medical School, reported at a meeting of the Society of General Internal Medicine this month in Boston.</p>
        <p>Dr. Soumerai's team estimated that heart attack patients aged 80 to 90 who were treated with clot-busting drugs had a 30 percent greater risk of death than those who did not.</p>
        <p>The study that Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz led at Yale came up with puzzling findings about the benefits and risks of clot-busting drugs.</p>
        <p>The Yale study included more than 37,000 Medicare patients 65 and older. Unlike the Johns Hopkins study, it included patients who had angioplasty and evaluated their status both at 30 days and one year after therapy.</p>
        <p>After 30 days, patients who received clot-busting drugs did not have a higher survival rate than those who did not receive either therapy; angioplasty did provide a better survival rate than clot-busting drugs.</p>
        <p>But after a year, patients who had received either clot-busting drugs or angioplasty had a higher survival rate than those who had received neither.</p>
        <p>Dr. Krumholz said he could not explain why clot-busting therapy provided a long-term benefit but not a short-term one in the study. The paper has been accepted for publication in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology.</p>
        <p>''The findings from the three studies are consistent in questioning current conventional wisdom about thrombolytics, but how they affect practice needs to be discussed,'' Dr. Krumholz said.</p>
