        <p>Lycos, one of the nation's biggest Internet portals, has agreed to be acquired by Telefonica of Spain in a sweeping deal across borders and languages worth more than $12 billion, a top executive close to the talks said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The deal, which could be announced as early as today, would combine Lycos with Terra Networks, the Internet arm of Telefonica, and link that new hybrid in a partnership with the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann, the executive said. The portal would have millions of users from Europe to Latin America.</p>
        <p>The three companies are expected to call a news conference today to announce the union. But until then, executives from the various companies refused to comment on the deal, which would be the first purchase of a large United States Internet company by a European Internet access provider.</p>
        <p>Negotiations were moving toward an advanced stage late last night, the executive said. He said that Terra would buy Lycos in an all-stock deal that would swap more than 1.7 Terra shares for each share of Lycos, or more than $100 based on closing prices on Friday. Shares of Lycos rose $7.50 yesterday, to $61.625. Terra slipped 0.90 euros, to 64 euros, or $58.37.</p>
        <p>The purchase would give Terra -- a fast-growing European Internet company -- a wide opening into North America to sell its Web services to the expanding Hispanic population in the United States. And for Bertelsmann, an alliance would broaden its global reach, allowing the conglomerate to sell John Grisham novels through Lycos in the United States or offer Carlos Santana music that can be downloaded through Telefonica cellular phones in Europe or Terra portals in Brazil. The executive said Telefonica would pay Bertelsmann an undisclosed sum for a 25 percent stake in a new online bookstore that it will create called Bol.com South America. Bertelsmann would retain the other 75 percent.</p>
        <p>In addition, the executive said the two European companies were expected to sign a five-year agreement that would anoint Bertelsmann as the ''preferred content provider'' on Lycos in the United States in exchange for $1 billion. That designation means that the company's products will get more prominent display, advertising and special promotions through the Lycos portal, which ranks fourth in size in the United States in terms of visitors.</p>
        <p>Lycos and Bertelsmann now jointly own Lycos Europe, the third-most- visited network of Web sites in Germany. The executive said that the latest agreement called for Bertelsmann to consider folding the Lycos Europe operation with the United States counterpart by 2003.</p>
        <p>It was not clear yesterday who would run the combined companies after the deal brings together Terra, based in Madrid, and Lycos, which is based in Waltham, Mass. And the negotiations had not yielded a new name for the hybrid. The chief negotiators in the initial discussions included Juan Villalonga, the chairman of Telefonica, Spain's biggest telephone company, and the chief executive of Lycos, Bob Davis. Over the last few weeks, Bertelsmann's chief executive, Thomas Middelhoff, joined in the discussions that were continuing through yesterday.</p>
        <p>Analysts said that the pan-American alliance to a certain extent reflected the very forces that prompted Time Warner and America Online to unite in a company that mixed old media and new -- one offering a rich source of content and the other an Internet platform.</p>
        <p>''The media is converging, and you've got some very strong players -- one from the old media and one from the new,'' said Andrea Williams Rice, the managing director of Deutsche Bank in San Francisco. ''There's an interest to bring together two players and make the sum greater than its parts. Lycos could not very effectively extend its reach into the old-line world. It would have had to pay a lot of money to pay for the distribution that Bertelsmann has. And until now, Bertelsmann has not been able to build an online presence comparable to its off-line position.'' The one disadvantage that this new union could face is the difficulty in integrating companies with three different national cultures. ''The risk with every merger is that you're bringing together a number of players with different backgrounds and agendas,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Henry M. Blodget, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities, said that the union gave the various companies a powerful global reach. ''This fits into the ongoing theme of consolidation where you have a few strong players continue to get stronger by either merging with each other or acquiring smaller companies.''</p>
        <p>Lycos has had other suitors in the past, but a union never happened. Last year, Barry Diller's media company, USA Networks Inc., tried to purchase Lycos, but that pursuit collapsed because of opposition from Lycos stockholders. The acquisition was canceled last May amid objections from shareholders led by David Wetherell, chairman of CMGI Inc., which owns about 15 percent of Lycos.</p>
        <p>Telefonica has also recently weathered a failed merger attempt, with KPN Telecom of the Netherlands. At the behest of the Spanish government, bankers on the company's board vetoed a $58 billion merger that would have created Europe's fourth-largest phone company, with a market value of $125 billion.</p>
