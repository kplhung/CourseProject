        <p>Here was a stacked deck if ever there was one. James Levine and the Met Orchestra have wowed listeners in recent years with concerts at Carnegie Hall, typically showing the players' versatility with symphonic repertory. But as the season winds down, Mr. Levine has turned even those concerts largely to operatic fare, in which this orchestra is unsurpassed in proficiency.</p>
        <p>The program on Wednesday evening was distinctly odd: an overstuffed evening of almost entirely operatic fare, mingling chestnuts with a few harder nuts. It was as if Mr. Levine and the players were trying to unwind after two weeks of Wagner ''Ring'' performances at the Metropolitan Opera but needed to keep the evening long and larded with Wagner to prevent too sudden withdrawal.</p>

        <p>Here was a stacked deck if ever there was one. James Levine and the Met Orchestra have wowed listeners in recent years with concerts at Carnegie Hall, typically showing the players' versatility with symphonic repertory. But as the season winds down, Mr. Levine has turned even those concerts largely to operatic fare, in which this orchestra is unsurpassed in proficiency.</p>
        <p>The program on Wednesday evening was distinctly odd: an overstuffed evening of almost entirely operatic fare, mingling chestnuts with a few harder nuts. It was as if Mr. Levine and the players were trying to unwind after two weeks of Wagner ''Ring'' performances at the Metropolitan Opera but needed to keep the evening long and larded with Wagner to prevent too sudden withdrawal.</p>
        <p>The program began as an old-fashioned pops concert. The orchestra played the Overture from Verdi's ''Forza del Destino,'' the Polonaise from Tchaikovsky's ''Yevgeny Onegin,'' the Polka from Smetana's ''Bartered Bride,'' the Dance of the Seven Veils from Strauss's ''Salome'' and, with Sylvia McNair as soloist, an aria, ''Deh vieni, non tardar,'' from Mozart's ''Nozze di  Figaro.''</p>
        <p>It was all superbly played, and there is indeed much to be gained from hearing such music live and outside the pit: a tingling sparkle in the Tchaikovsky, for example; a rich bloom on the Smetana; a clarity and vividness of color in the Strauss. Ms. McNair sang with lovely, limpid tone, exquisitely modulated.</p>
        <p>Then the program veered definitively into the 20th century with an aria, ''No word From Tom,'' from Stravinsky's ''Rake's Progress,'' and the five Symphonic Pieces from Berg's ''Lulu.'' In the Stravinsky Ms. McNair showed a bit of strain and unevenness along with a fine sensitivity. In Lulu's Song, Jennifer Welch, a soprano in the Met's Young Artist Development Program, displayed everything needed to make a good start in the opera's title role except a certain abandon, which will undoubtedly accrue with experience.</p>
        <p>Then came the Wagner: ''A Faust Overture,'' which apart from the ''Siegfried Idyll'' is undoubtedly the best of Wagner's symphonic works against feeble competition; and the Prelude and ''Liebestod'' from ''Tristan und Isolde.'' The ''Liebestod'' seemed especially odd emanating from this orchestra without the vocal part, but perhaps a statement was being made as to the real pecking order of stardom at the Met.</p>
        <p>Few would argue, to be sure, that the orchestra is the landed aristocracy of that house. Its corporate sound here proved luscious, and fine solo contributions were abundant, especially from Michael Parloff, a principal flutist, and John Ferrillo, a principal oboist.</p>
        <p>The orchestra's final program, at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center on Friday and at Carnegie on Sunday, to end the hall's season, is a more compelling and coherent mix of operatic and symphonic repertory, by Bartok: ''Bluebeard's Castle,'' with Anne Sofie von Otter and Samuel Ramey, and the Concerto for Orchestra. The concerto was intended to reveal virtuosity and flair in every corner of an ensemble, and certainly no orchestra merits such a showpiece more.</p>
