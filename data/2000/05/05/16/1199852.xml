        <p>PROUST'S WAY  A Field Guide to 'In Search of Lost Time'  By Roger Shattuck  291 pages. W. W. Norton. $26.95.</p>
        <p>Marcel Proust, he of the little madeleines and the long sentences and the redeeming power of memory, is not the Marcel Proust of this intellectually powerful, deeply considered evaluation by Roger Shattuck, the highly esteemed scholar of French literary culture. Mr. Shattuck writes about the Proust beyond the standard image. His new book, aptly titled ''Proust's Way: A Field Guide to 'In Search of Lost Time,' '' learnedly guides the reader, familiar with Proust or not, into the deeper moral and philosophical dimensions of the writer.</p>
        <p>The heart of Mr. Shattuck's argument comes in two chapters titled ''Proust's Complaint'' and ''Proust's Binoculars: Memory and Recognition,'' the sort of capaciously penetrating literary criticism rarely seen these days. Mr. Shattuck's main purpose in these chapters is to identify the themes that unite Proust's oceanic comedy of French manners. Beforehand, he fills in the background on Proust's novel -- whose title Mr. Shattuck translates as ''In Search of Lost Time'' rather than the better known ''A Remembrance of Things Past'' -- that any reader would need to follow his argument.</p>
        <p>Proust, sickly, sensitive, preternaturally aware, began writing ''Search'' when he was 35, having lived his life on the fringes of fin de siecle high French society. Mr. Shattuck cites unflattering critical judgments on Proust from the likes of Aldous Huxley and Henry James to the effect that Proust's style was slack to the point of incoherence and that his novel never transcended the decadence and ennui that it describes. Mr. Shattuck, prefiguring the themes that he will develop later, declares Proust ''guilty -- but not as charged.'' Traits like ''snobbery, megalomania, boredom, aestheticism, and instability of character'' do loom large in ''Search,'' but to understand Proust's greatness, he avers, one has to understand ''the role they are assigned in a remarkably coherent work of art.''</p>
        <p>If one knows anything at all about ''In Search of Lost Time,'' it would be that it is about the intense power of a certain kind of memory -- the memory that the aging Marcel experiences when he dips a madeleine into a cup of linden tea and the taste unexpectedly restores the lost feelings of his youth at his aunt's country house at Combray. For Mr. Shattuck, ''Search'' is about memory but is vastly richer in themes and insights than that. In ''Proust's Complaint,'' for example, he probes what Proust called an ''infirmity in my nature,'' and what Mr. Shattuck calls ''this distressing perverseness that dogs the most enterprising activities of the human mind and seems to deprive it of satisfaction.'' The infirmity is the nasty psychological law by which experience falls short of our expectations of it, the existence of a kind of barrier between perception and reality.</p>
        <p>This is, as Mr. Shattuck acknowledges, no more than the cliche that the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. But Proust elaborated on that cliche more than any other writer, he contends, and his elaboration produced a masterpiece that is more comic than tragic, more vibrant than sad. Marcel, who is both a character in Proust's novel and one of its narrators, makes strenuous efforts to satisfy his ambition and then loses interest just when he seems about to succeed. Mr. Shattuck's assessment of one of Proust's more famous scenes, when the young Marcel finally succeeds in kissing Albertine, the chief object of his desire, brings this point home to great effect. ''When he kisses Albertine, he confronts 10 Albertines, no one of whom he desires,'' Mr. Shattuck writes. ''Marcel carries a pall wherever he goes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shattuck gives this theme historical resonance by tracing Marcel's particular kind of self-doubt back to Montaigne, who three centuries before Proust wrote: ''I attach too little value to things I possess, just because I possess them.'' Proust in this sense is a chronicler not so much of social mores as of the universal human condition, manifested in Marcel's paralysis in the face of what he most desires. Mr. Shattuck, drawing on an impressive degree of erudition, shows some of the sources of Proust's deliberation on these deep flaws in human nature, and he links those flaws to another concept, which Proust called ''intermittence,'' the inability of people to be all of themselves at any given time.</p>
        <p>''The 'Search' as a whole seeks not to transcend that condition but to encompass it,'' Mr. Shattuck writes. ''The book becomes oceanic in scale in order to contain the changing weathers and tides and crosscurrents of a long voyage.''</p>
        <p>In the end, Proust's narrator arrives, in Mr. Shattuck's view, at a kind of wise tolerance. ''Fully understood as part of our lot, Proust's complaint leads not to despair but to a gentle smile at the vagaries of human persons and at the time it takes us to recognize ourselves for what we are,'' Mr. Shattuck writes.</p>
        <p>In ''Proust's Binoculars'' Mr. Shattuck traces a complicated argument showing how the visual imagery in ''Search'' relates to Proust's underlying concept of perception. Error of perception is the critical concept in Mr. Shattuck's analysis. He leads the reader through a series of literary byways to his belief that ''Search'' is less about memory than it is about what Mr. Shattuck calls ''recognition,'' specifically Marcel's recognition of himself as a writer.</p>
        <p>''The complex shuffling and sorting out of images that we call 'recognizing' a person arises from the reality of disappearing selves, of death,'' Mr. Shattuck writes. ''The perpetual menace of death, instead of discouraging Marcel, spurs him on anew toward his 'urgent, capital rendezvous with himself.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shattuck's arguments are sophisticated and subtle and not always easy to follow. Indeed, one reads certain passages and then one rereads them to sift their meaning. The effort produces ample rewards. Mr. Shattuck leaves us not only with a deepened appreciation of Proust's great work but of all great literature as well, because in the deepest sense he has done what all literary criticism strives to do: he has taught us how to read.</p>
