        <p>Over the last five years, the New York State Board of Regents has enacted a series of public school reforms that have placed the state in the lead of the national movement for standards and accountability. At the same time, however, local educators and politicians who claim to want reform have sometimes reacted with skepticism and resistance when confronted with the discomfort that comes with change. Defenders of the status quo whipped up a fuss, for example, when the Regents raised graduation standards across the state, demanded a tougher curriculum and began to issue ''report cards'' that exposed as mediocre schools that many citizens thought were excellent.</p>
        <p>A similar backlash has emerged since the Regents announced that they will soon begin reporting student performance by income and race, to focus attention on the achievement gap that often exists between rich and poor and between white and minority students within the same school. Critics say that holding districts accountable for closing the achievement gap is onerous and unfair, some of them suggesting that nothing can be done. But national studies indicate that the gap can indeed be closed and that disaggregating data by race and income is a crucial first step in the process.</p>
        <p>Pessimism about closing the performance gap is widespread, but it is not supported by the facts. The most recent study of national achievement data by the Education Trust, a Washington foundation devoted to school reform, shows that while black and Latino students continue to trail white students on reading scores, schools that serve those students made great strides in recent decades. Between the mid-70's and mid-90's, the gap in achievement between African-American and white students, as measured by a federally sponsored test called the National Assessment of Educational Progress, narrowed by about half. The progress stopped in the late 1980's, when poverty became more concentrated and educators began to focus on remedial studies instead of much-needed high-level instruction.</p>
        <p>Several states now report performance by race, most notably Texas. It began its effort in the 1980's with the Perot Commission, whose work culminated a decade later in a novel accountability system that rates the public schools by how well their minority students perform. Simply put, a school cannot receive the highest state rating unless 90 percent of its students -- including 90 percent of minority students -- perform at the highest levels on all state assessments. Texans looked at the data and recognized that the schools were jeopardizing the state's future by writing off minorities -- who make up more than half the public school enrollment. Since the reform effort, more minority students than ever are taking the Scholastic Assessment Tests, setting their sights on college.</p>
        <p>The New York State Board of Regents created a similar momentum when it raised standards, requiring all students to pass Regents exams to graduate from high school. By disaggregating performance scores by race and economic status, the Regents hope to focus public opinion on the achievement gap in New York, forcing schools to work harder on minority achievement.</p>
