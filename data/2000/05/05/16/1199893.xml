        <p>As Federal Reserve policy makers meet today, investors are wondering more about what comes next than how much the central bank will raise its short-term interest rate target when it announces its decision early this afternoon.</p>
        <p>Wall Street is forecasting an increase of half a percentage point in the central bank's federal funds target rate on overnight loans, raising that target to 6.5 percent. Until recently, most analysts had expected a quarter-point move, matching the five increases the Fed has made since June.</p>
        <p>But, more important, most analysts now think that the Fed will have to move well above 6.5 percent, perhaps this summer, before economic growth is curbed and new inflationary pressures are contained. And if inflation data worsens -- as some signs now indicate -- the outlook may shift to even higher rates.</p>
        <p>Investors ''are going to see the decision, then immediately thoughts will jump ahead,'' said Ethan Harris, senior economist at Lehman Brothers. ''How much more do we have to go?''</p>
        <p>What all this means for the stock market, however, is hard to predict, both immediately and in the near term. Yesterday, equity and bond investors did not seem concerned.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average rose 198.41 points, or 1.9 percent, to 10,807.78, while the Nasdaq composite index climbed 78.59 points, or 2.2 percent, to 3,607.65. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index jumped 31.40 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,452.36. But all three indexes are below where they were when the new, disturbing data on inflation began appearing April 27.</p>
        <p>In the bond market, prices rose as yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 15/32 , to 100 14/32 , with its yield falling to 6.44 percent yesterday, from 6.51 percent on Friday. The yield remains well above the 6.13 percent on April 26.</p>
        <p>The size of the Fed's rate increase, and the outlook statement it will issue today with the announcement, could have a crucial bearing on the markets. The April report on consumer prices, which is expected to be released this morning ahead of the Fed meeting, could also have a major impact.</p>
        <p>If the Consumer Price Index's monthly increase, especially in the core inflation rate that excludes food and energy, is surprisingly big, as it was in March, both the bond and stock markets could have sell-offs. With such a surprise, investors would immediately speculate that interest rates would have to move much higher this year, no matter how aggressive the Fed is today.</p>
        <p>However, analysts are forecasting a tame C.P.I., with the core rate up 0.2 percent and the overall rate flat or up just 0.1 percent.</p>
        <p>The change in the atmosphere on Wall Street has been almost palpable over the last three weeks. In that time, new employment figures have shown the economy still to be growing briskly, and new data on prices and wage-and-benefit costs have signaled that inflationary pressures are building.</p>
        <p>''We got this overpowering private sector demand in conjunction with some real inflation sparks,'' said Robert V. DiClemente, chief United States economist at Salomon Smith Barney. ''This is not a false alarm,'' he said of the data pointing to higher inflation rates.</p>
        <p>The new data forced him to raise his forecast for the Fed's short-term interest rate target to 7.5 percent by the end of the year, from 6.75 percent. Mr. Harris of Lehman said his firm's forecast was now for a federal funds target of 7.25 percent by August, up from 6.75 percent.</p>
        <p>Various indicators of investor sentiment on the Fed also show expectations that rates will move much higher than was thought just a few weeks ago. For example, on April 24, the federal funds futures contract for September indicated that investors expected an average rate of 6.45 percent for September. That average for September has now jumped to 6.93 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harris said ''it will be hard to find a silver lining'' in today's Fed action if, as he expects, the Fed does raise its target by half a percentage point and signals that inflation is still a concern, meaning that more rate increases are in the offing. While Lehman is in the minority, he said there is better than a 50 percent chance the Fed will raise its target another half a percentage point when policy makers meet in the last week of June.</p>
        <p>What might soothe the markets some, he said, is the expected increase of half a percentage point and a neutral statement that investors could interpret to mean that Fed policy makers do not think rates have to be pushed much higher. In 1994, the Fed made two increases of half a percentage point each in its interest rate target that came with such neutral outlook statements. Both the bond and stock markets rallied. But Mr. Harris does not expect such a soothing statement this time and in 1994 the Fed ended up pushing rates much higher, despite the reassuring statements.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiClemente said that a surprisingly big increase in the core rate of the Consumer Price Index, just a quarter-point rate increase in the Fed's interest rate target or a soothing statement from the Fed about the outlook for inflation could end up troubling investors in the longer term. In all cases, he said it would be possible for investors to begin to worry that the Fed was not acting aggressively enough to curb inflation by slowing economic growth.</p>
        <p>If that opinion begins to influence investors, he said, two bad things could happen. First, investors would believe the Fed would have to make bigger-than-expected rate increases later to regain the offensive against inflation. More important, the threat of larger rate increases and falling behind in the fight to curb inflation would make investors fear a ''hard landing'' for the economy. That is Wall Street jargon for the threat of a recession.</p>
        <p>But Mr. DiClemente said if the Fed raised its interest rate target half a percentage point and if the core price figure rose just 0.2 percent, then these might be comforting because investors would not conclude that the Fed was losing the battle. That is what he is predicting.</p>
