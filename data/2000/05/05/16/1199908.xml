        <p>Ian Thorpe, the teenage torpedo of world swimming, said Sunday that he had great expectations for himself. He matched those quiet words with swift action today by delivering the third of three world records in three days.</p>
        <p>Thorpe, five months shy of his 18th birthday, powered his 6-foot-6-inch frame in the 200-meter and 400-meter freestyle events, breaking his own world records in the Australian Olympic trials over the weekend to qualify for those races in the Summer Games here in September.</p>
        <p>Tonight, in the 200-meter final, Thorpe was in record-setting form, slicing an additional .18 of a second from his record for a time of  1 minute 45.51 seconds. In the semifinals Sunday night, Thorpe swam 1:45.69, cutting .31 seconds off the world record he set last August at the Pan-Pacific championships.</p>
        <p>''He's awesome,'' Michael Klim, 20, said after finishing half a body length behind Thorpe.</p>
        <p>Klim also qualified for an Olympic start, giving Australia strong reason to hope for two medals in the 200 meters.</p>
        <p>An hour before Thorpe achieved his third world record today, Australia's chief swim coach, Don Talbot, said he thought that Thorpe had looked ''a little strained and tired'' after breaking two records over the weekend. But Thorpe was smiling and hardly breathless tonight as he emerged to tell a poolside television interviewer: ''I swam for an Olympic place, not a record. I was feeling a bit tired, but I had the Olympic incentive.''</p>
        <p>On Saturday, in the Australian team qualifiers, Thorpe began his tripleheader by breaking by half a second his 400-meter world mark of 3.41.83.</p>
        <p>Crowds of about 8,000 cheered Thorpe's records -- perhaps the only sounds of popular approval organizers of the Sydney Games have heard in a week. The lighting ceremony in Greece of the torch for the 2000 Olympics produced criticism of Kevan Gosper, Australia's most senior member of the International Olympic Committee.</p>
        <p>Gosper, who is a former Olympic track medalist, was forced to apologize for what he called ''my lapse of judgment, clouded by fatherly pride.'' He said he had accepted an official Greek invitation for his 11-year-old daughter, Sophie, to be the first Australian to run in the first stage of the torch relay last Wednesday.</p>
        <p>That honor had been allotted months earlier to a Greek-Australian high school student, Yianna Souleles, 15, who had been chosen by Sydney's influential Greek immigrant community to represent Australian youth at the ceremonial start of the torch's journey to Sydney.</p>
        <p>Gosper was cleared today by the I.O.C. ethics commission of having violated rules on excessive travel and gifts during Salt Lake City's winning campaign for the 2002 Winter Games.</p>
        <p>Organizers of the Sydney Games hope that Thorpe's rush of records, which boost Australian hopes of winning as many as nine gold swim medals, will distract attention from Gosper's mistake, the latest in a series of public relations disasters.</p>
