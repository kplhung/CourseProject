        <p>If doctors had been able to give me the information about my baby prenatally that they gave me when my son was 6 months old, in 1995, I would have seriously considered abortion (''Advances, and Angst, in a New Era of Ultrasound,'' May 9).</p>
        <p>To put a little baby through the ''life'' that the doctors described seemed unthinkable. My son has the most severe form of spinal muscular atrophy, a common genetic cause of death in young children. Then, technology was not available to diagnose it prenatally.</p>

        <p>As things happened, Jack was already here, smiling constantly and living. His care is demanding and the emotional strain is very difficult at times, but I cannot imagine my life without him.</p>
        <p>Jack is a constant inspiration to his family and community, he has shown us what is meaningful in life in so many ways.</p>
        <p>I am concerned that when doctors share prenatal information, they are neglecting the information that many families with special-needs children would share: that you will love this ''imperfect'' child completely, hope for his life constantly and find the idea of ending his life unimaginable.</p>
