        <p>Britain's biggest hotel owner, Granada Group, said it was discussing a merger with Compass Group P.L.C., the country's largest contract caterer, that would permit Granada to separate its hospitality and media activities. Granada owns one-third of the Independent Television Network of Britain, and a split would enable it to concentrate on strengthening its television production interests. Compass and Granada shares both rose about 4 percent. Granada said a merger would reflect the company's recent market values: $9.3 billion for Compass and $17.8 billion for Granada.</p>
