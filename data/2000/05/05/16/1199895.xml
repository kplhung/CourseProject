        <p>The United States asked the Security Council today to impose sanctions on Ethiopia and Eritrea until fighting stops along their border.</p>
        <p>The proposed resolution would prohibit the sale or delivery of all kinds of weapons and military equipment to either side. It would also bar senior Ethiopian officials from international travel.</p>
        <p>Ethiopia opened the latest phase of a three-year war by attacking Eritrea on Friday and has rejected a council demand to return to peace talks.</p>
        <p>The American proposal is meeting resistance in the council, said Ambassador Nancy Soderberg, who represented the United States in the discussions today.</p>
        <p>Russia has a draft resolution of its own; it does not include an arms ban but rather calls for more diplomatic missions to the region. But Russia, which has been selling arms to both sides, is not likely to veto an American resolution, diplomats say.</p>
        <p>China's ambassador, Wang Yingfan, who is this month's council president, told reporters after the meeting today that China generally opposed sanctions anywhere because of their effects on the general population. But some diplomats say that China may be swayed to support some kind of embargo, or at least not vote against it, if African members of the council join in the call for action.</p>
        <p>France is prepared to accept sanctions if they come with a time limit, diplomats said after the meeting.</p>
        <p>The council will return to the issue on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Last Friday, after war broke out over claims to disputed territory, the council gave the two sides 72 hours to recommit themselves to negotiations, which had collapsed two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>After the breakdown, seven council members on a peace mission in Africa detoured to the Horn of Africa for last-minute talks with President Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea and Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia. By then, however, it seemed clear to the visiting diplomats that the two sides were on an unstoppable march to battle.</p>
        <p>Ms. Soderberg, who is a specialist on Africa for the American mission to the United Nations, said today that two earlier rounds of fighting between Eritrea and Ethiopia in 1998 and 1999 have killed as many people as the United States lost in Vietnam. Casualty estimates from those pitched battles -- carried out in trench warfare -- range from 20,000 to 70,000 dead.</p>
        <p>France and several African nations have suggested that arbitration of the border would be possible. Few differences remained between the two sides in peace talks, diplomats say.</p>
        <p>Observing the 72-hour deadline they had been set, both countries sent letters to the council today. Eritrea, which is getting hit hard by Ethiopian troops, said it was prepared to return to talks. Ethiopia sent what an envoy called a ''very belligerent'' letter defying the council and rejecting mediation.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Meles of Ethiopia is assumed to be under intense pressure from hard-liners who resent the agreement that gave Eritrea independence from Ethiopia in 1993. When Eritrea separated, it took Ethiopia's only port, at Assab on the Red Sea, making Ethiopia a landlocked country.</p>
        <p>The port is not a target of fighting now, but some United Nations officials say they think it remains Ethiopia's ultimate goal.</p>
