        <p>On Earth, a major volcanic eruption can spew billions of cubic yards of ash and dust into the air. From there, it can be distributed throughout the atmosphere and deflect enough sunlight to lower temperatures worldwide for several years, as the massive Krakatoa eruption did in 1883.</p>

        <p>Io's Potent Moondust</p>
        <p>On Earth, a major volcanic eruption can spew billions of cubic yards of ash and dust into the air. From there, it can be distributed throughout the atmosphere and deflect enough sunlight to lower temperatures worldwide for several years, as the massive Krakatoa eruption did in 1883.</p>
        <p>Impressive, yes, but nothing like what an extraterrestrial volcano can do, to judge from recent research involving Jupiter's moon Io, which scientists consider to be the most active volcanic body in the solar system.</p>
        <p>Researchers in Germany and Norway, analyzing data from the Galileo spacecraft, which has been orbiting Jupiter since 1995, have determined that volcanoes on Io are the source of streams of dust that flow from the area of Jupiter into the rest of the solar system. These dust streams, which were first discovered in 1992, flow out about 175 million miles, or nearly twice the distance of the Earth to the sun.</p>
        <p>The scientists, reporting on their work in Nature, analyzed the frequency of peak impacts on Galileo's dust detector. They found that the peaks coincided with the periods of Io's orbit and Jupiter's rotation. The dust, made up of tiny grains as small as particles of smoke, is strongly affected by Jupiter's magnetic field. Further study may provide insight into how the much more abundant dust in the early days of the solar system behaved under the influence of the sun's magnetic field.</p>
        <p>Spices as Shields</p>
        <p>They are not suggesting that a meal of chicken vindaloo might be the best protection in the event of World War III, but scientists in India have made the intriguing discovery that certain spices can prevent bacteria from being destroyed by radiation.</p>
        <p>The researchers, reporting in The Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, found that chili powder offered E. coli and other bacteria the best protection against gamma rays, followed by black pepper and turmeric. Antioxidants and perhaps other compounds in the spices were found to help protect the bacterial DNA from damage.</p>
        <p>The scientists noted that the spices offered only limited protection, and that in irradiation of processed foods, the dosage levels are high enough to kill off all bacteria, no matter how spicy the dish. But the researchers suggest that their work may someday lead to the use of spice extracts to protect healthy tissues in people undergoing radiation therapy.</p>
        <p>El Nino, the Ancient</p>
        <p>There is a tendency to think of El Nino as a new phenomenon, as modern as alternate side of the street parking, say, or microwave popcorn. Scientists who study climate history, however, know that El Nino events, when the waters of the eastern Pacific warm up and influence the weather worldwide, have occurred for at least 5,000 years.</p>
        <p>Make that at least 17,500 years, according to researchers at the University of Massachusetts. Writing in the journal Science, the researchers describe evidence of a three- to five-year cycle of El Nino events during the late part of the last ice age.</p>
        <p>That evidence was found not by trekking to the edge of the Earth, but rather to the edge of the UMass campus in Amherst. The scientists studied cores taken from a site usually used for research on civil engineering.</p>
        <p>The cores were made up of sediments deposited toward the end of the ice age, when what is known as the Laurentide Ice Sheet was receding, leaving a huge lake that covered most of what is now the Connecticut River Valley. The thickness of the annual sediment layers in the cores reflects how fast the ice sheet was melting. The researchers found that there was a cyclical variability in the thick layers, when the warmth of El Nino events would have caused the ice to melt faster.</p>
        <p>The researchers suggest that by showing that El Nino events occurred under such vastly different conditions all those years ago, their work will help scientists understand more about the phenomenon today.</p>
