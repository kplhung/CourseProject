        <p>Soon, the human genome will be completely mapped allowing doctors to detect, treat and prevent disease on a level unimaginable a few decades ago. But while genetic screening tests are remarkable diagnostic tools, they are not without potential harm to those who happen to carry a deleterious trait. As a physician who routinely orders such tests, I thought I long understood this dynamic. But I needed my wife, Kate, for a more definitive lesson.</p>
        <p>When Kate told me she was pregnant with our first child I was, of course, elated. Soon enough, I began to worry about the possibility of a less than perfectly healthy baby. Most expectant parents nervously ponder this issue, but my work as a pediatrician creates an especially skewed vision: many of the children who inhabit my world are among that tiny minority with the most serious and often the rarest illnesses. In a strange sense, when abnormality and disease dominate your view, it becomes ''normal.''</p>
        <p>On the advice of her obstetrician, Kate underwent a complete battery of genetic tests but this only sharpened my fears. What if one of us carried a deadly disease that might be passed on to our unborn child?  Such mental meanderings reminded me that like many doctors, I absolutely hate the idea of my (or my loved ones') being a patient.</p>
        <p>One evening, I came home to find Kate nervously hunched over a cup of tea. Before I could even take off my coat, she told me that she tested positive for the genetic screening test for Tay-Sachs Disease (T.S.D.), a rare genetic disease that clusters among Ashkenazi Jews, of Central and Eastern European descent. Coded by a recessive gene, meaning that one can be a silent carrier, the actual disease requires both parents to have the trait. Even then, there is only a one out of four chance that their baby will receive both genes.</p>
        <p>T.S.D. is a horrific malady resulting from the baby's inability to produce one critical enzyme (beta-hexosamidinase A) necessary for normal brain growth and development. First described in the 1880's by a British ophthalmologist, Warren Tay, and a New York City neurologist, Bernard Sachs -- each of whom had many immigrant Ashkenazi Jews among his patients -- the disease is 100 percent fatal. Although newborns with the disease appear normal, within several months, they begin to exhibit severe muscular weakness -- pediatricians call them ''floppy babies'' -- and difficulty doing the activities infants typically do: rolling over, crawling and walking, feeding, swallowing and ultimately breathing.</p>
        <p>Compounding these problems are blindness, seizures and a generalized haze of unresponsiveness. Death comes all too mercifully for T.S.D. babies long before a healthy child is readied for kindergarten.</p>
        <p>Although no one in our families had been identified as a T.S.D. carrier, we most certainly fit the profile. Both of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, our grandparents were close friends and members of the same Yiddish social clubs, known as landsmanshaftn, that were formed in America at the turn of century to help newcomers adjust to a new life. Not only did Kate's grandfather Ben dance at our wedding, 24 years before he danced at my bar mitzvah.</p>
        <p>Even with this intertwined family history, however, the odds of our both being carriers, let alone the baby's having T.S.D. were low.</p>
        <p>Only 1 in 35 Ashkenazi Jews carry the trait and, before genetic screening became available in the 1970's, about 1 in 3,500 to 4,000 of their newborns suffered from T.S.D. Today, the incidence is much lower since more than 95 percent of the pregnancies are terminated when T.S.D. is identified by prenatal screening.</p>
        <p>The following morning as I rolled up my sleeve for a blood test, I told myself that I ''knew'' all about T.S.D. I had even written several scholarly papers on the stigma of genetic screening tests. Such intellectualization, however, offered little comfort and did not allay my fears.</p>
        <p>To worsen matters, when I told Kate that I had discussed her carrier status with some of my friends, she was perturbed that I divulged this information without discussing it with her first, revealing how little I really understood about the sensitivities of those labeled a ''carrier'' of a devastating illness.</p>
        <p>Bad news finds you quickly, doctors like to advise their patients, but you often have to wait for good news. Each night as I walked home from work, I prayed that this child would pass this first hurdle unscathed.</p>
        <p>I bargained with God on how I would be a model parent. I wept at the possibility that I, too, was a carrier and the potential options facing my wife and me. In a small sense, I felt the anguish, the helplessness, and the uncertainty of a patient. And I was reminded of what a patient once told me when confronted with a terrible diagnosis: before someone tells you that you or your loved one is sick you may have a hundred problems. Afterward, you have only one.</p>
        <p>A week later Kate called me at the office. From the tone of her voice, I immediately knew it was good news. ''You're negative, Howard,'' she exclaimed. ''The baby can't have Tay-Sachs.'' As I rushed home to embrace my wife, I wept again, this time with joy. We were particularly fortunate in that many genetic screening tests do not provide such definitive ''yes'' or ''no'' answers.</p>
        <p>Indeed, some of the newer tests, like the BRCA1 genetic test for breast cancer, only indicate a higher risk of developing a specific disease without any clear guarantees one way or the other, creating a host of new problems of decision making for patients.</p>
        <p>Kate is now in her eighth month of pregnancy and there are still more tests for our unborn child to pass -- not counting a lifetime of tribulations that await her or him a few weeks hence. But we'll have to take each day as it comes -- which is, most likely, how the noble term patient originated.</p>
