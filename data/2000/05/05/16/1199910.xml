        <p>THE story comes down to 2.3 seconds of hard-core evidence that could not be swept away with contemptuous denial, the kind that Bob Knight's toadies in Bloomington, Ind., directed at the young man whose neck fit so snugly into Knight's steel grip.</p>
        <p>Of course, even when the sickening video flashed across the country's television and computer screens, the toadies practically celebrated the almost irrelevant discrepancies in Neil Reed's account of the incident. The truth they'd been living with for so long was apparently too painful to see.</p>
        <p>Finally, after 29 years of being held hostage by a basketball coach, Indiana University has been compelled by a videotape to investigate Knight, and yesterday the school announced the results in the way medical experts unveil the cracking of genetic codes.</p>
        <p>Did you know that Bob Knight had engaged in a ''lengthy pattern of troubling behavior?''</p>
        <p>Myles Brand, the university president, and John Walda, the president of its board of trustees, sat through a news conference with straight and solemn faces and claimed this was news to them. They implied they had no idea that a man who'd habitually become unglued in public was capable of much worse behind closed offices and gymnasium doors.</p>
        <p>Well, they had some idea, but never all the sordid, embarrassing details, and even with the investigation complete and thoroughly impartial, ''the pattern'' was the main problem.</p>
        <p>''No incident by itself rose to the level of termination,'' Brand said, after declaring that Knight had accepted a three-game suspension, a $30,000 fine and a zero-tolerance policy in exchange for ''one last chance.''</p>
        <p>The choking of a student-athlete was not enough for them to dismiss this ''man of integrity,'' as described by Brand. Nor the near assault of a female employee, nor the physical and verbal confrontations with various associates, superiors and subordinates, nor the abuse of anyone who happened to be in the way when Coach felt foul.</p>
        <p>To be fair, Brand said, and to perhaps cover the legal bases, Knight had never before been given a ''set of guidelines.'' Damn the lawyers. Does a so-called educator at a state institution need a code of conduct to distinguish between a chair he can throw and a person he might slug?</p>
        <p>After 29 years and so many free passes, an investigation that included the smoking video was somehow more about being fair to Knight than Neil Reed. It was still about not rendering the program rudderless and risking the potential defections of players and recruits. It was another case where the creep who can score gets away with a slap on the wrist, another frightful message that the welfare and safety of the typical student and innocent employee at Big Time U. is less of a priority than a potential run to the Final Four.</p>
        <p>''I had never seen him before contrite and apologetic,'' Brand said, which must mean that Knight never had to say he was sorry for his public meltdowns, and it never mattered as long as he ran a clean program and won.</p>
        <p>Knight apparently could have knocked out half the athletic department and terrorized a hundred secretaries. Toadies like Brand and Walda would have continued to churn out the excuses, the defenses, the way they did in February 1998.</p>
        <p>''Knight demands much of his players and himself,'' they wrote in an open letter that appeared in several Indiana newspapers. ''And when there are avoidable mistakes, he lets his feelings be known -- sometimes in a way that comes across as excessive. But he knows the limits of reasonable action and the difference between behavior that is acceptable and actions that are not. It is eminently clear to the university and to the coach.''</p>
        <p>Sure it was, and Neil Reed made the whole choking thing up, until the video surfaced and Knight's other victims stepped forward and he suddenly decided he has a ''temper problem.'' Finally, Myles Brand was ''troubled,'' and maybe this really is Knight's last chance, but the truth is that he was as much an embarrassment winning championships as he is now. He should have been canned a long time ago.</p>
        <p>Then again, when Neil Reed was ready to choose Kentucky in 1994, his father asked if he could count on Rick Pitino staying all four years. Reed had been treated for a heart condition and Terry Reed, a former Indiana high school coach, was naturally concerned about finding a stable place for his son.</p>
        <p>''There aren't many guys who you know won't leave or get fired,'' Neil Reed said at the time.</p>
        <p>No, Bob Knight doesn't leave, or get fired. Not even now.</p>
