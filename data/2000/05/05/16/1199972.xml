        <p>The Playa del Rey, Calif., office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, which has created irreverent brand image campaigns for the ABC television network, is losing that assignment as the network takes in-house the creative part of the account.</p>
        <p>Susan Sewell, a spokeswoman in New York for ABC, part of the Walt Disney Company, confirmed a report of the decision in The Myers Report, a media industry newsletter.</p>
        <p>She said that Alan Cohen, executive vice president for marketing at ABC, decided the network was no longer ''needing a full-service agency'' to create the campaigns ''as our business evolved.''</p>
        <p>TBWA/Chiat/Day will continue to handle media planning and buying for ABC, Ms. Sewell said, as well as work on special projects for the ABC Entertainment division.</p>
        <p>Jeremy Miller, spokesman for the agency, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group, said: ''We still have a good relationship with ABC, and we're proud of the work we've done. As the network moved operations from New York to the West Coast, they've been doing a lot of their on-air branding in-house and now they're taking it all in-house.''</p>
        <p>The campaigns, which carried themes like ''TV is good'' and ''We love TV,'' had been contentious because they were among the few that ever tried to develop an image for an entire network as well as for individual series. It was estimated that ABC was spending $40 million a year on the campaigns, which included nontraditional media like construction site posters, candy wrappers and pushcart umbrellas.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sewell said no decisions had been made about a campaign for the 2000-2001 season. ABC is scheduled to present its fall season schedule to advertisers today.</p>
