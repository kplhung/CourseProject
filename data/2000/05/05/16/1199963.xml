        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I had my first child at age 36 and was pleased with my ultrasounds and all of the blood tests results. I opted to skip the amniocentesis. Now, at age 39 and pregnant with my second, I am delighted with the opportunity to participate in the clinical trial for the ultrasound and blood test done in the first trimester.</p>
        <p>Even though the amniocentesis is recommended based upon my age, I am choosing to take every noninvasive test available.</p>

        <p>Even though the amniocentesis is recommended based upon my age, I am choosing to take every noninvasive test available.</p>
        <p>Although I know this goes against the current medical standards, I don't think that the amniocentesis would change anything since my husband and I both want to have this baby.</p>
        <p>I think it is wonderful that we have so many available options and that we have the freedom to choose among them.</p>
