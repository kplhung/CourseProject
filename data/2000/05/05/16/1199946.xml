        <p>When Phil  Knight, the chief executive of Nike, withdrew a promised $30 million donation to the University of Oregon last month, his announcement had the tone of an angry parent. He chastised the university for joining the Worker Rights Consortium, a group that monitors conditions in factories that make clothing with college logos. He accused the university of ''inserting itself into the new global economy where I make my living'' and doing so ''on the wrong side, fumbling a teachable moment.''</p>

        <p>When Phil  Knight, the chief executive of Nike, withdrew a promised $30 million donation to the University of Oregon last month, his announcement had the tone of an angry parent. He chastised the university for joining the Worker Rights Consortium, a group that monitors conditions in factories that make clothing with college logos. He accused the university of ''inserting itself into the new global economy where I make my living'' and doing so ''on the wrong side, fumbling a teachable moment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Knight, an Oregon graduate, was angry that the university had joined this consortium rather than the Fair Labor Association, a group that includes as members the same industries that have profited from sweatshop conditions in their production plants. The Worker Rights Consortium is based on the premise that work conditions will not be changed by codes and monitors that come from industry, but by involvement of workers, through collective bargaining with management.</p>
        <p>In joining the consortium, the University of Oregon pledged to use its influence to improve conditions at factories producing clothes with the university logo. Mr. Knight, accusing his alma mater of shredding its ''bonds of trust'' with him, seemed offended that it had not asked his permission.</p>
        <p>The university's decision was not made lightly. In March, a referendum sponsored by the student government yielded a three-fourths majority vote in support of membership. A committee accountable to the the university president, David B. Frohnmayer, and made up of students, faculty, administrators and alumni, voted unanimously the same month in favor of joining. Then the University Senate, composed of faculty and students, passed a resolution calling for membership. It was only after all these steps that President Frohnmayer signed the university into membership.</p>
        <p>Mr. Knight's punitive reaction really questions the autonomy of the university itself. If the voice of one alumnus held more weight than a year of university-wide deliberation, what role would there be for shared governance on campus? If donations from corporate America depended on toeing a corporate line, the university would be better off without the money.</p>
        <p>The goal of students across the country who are organizing around sweatshop issues is to create widespread change in an industry where insufficient wages and mandatory overtime are common. In many third world and American apparel factories, there have been reports of intimidation of workers who try to speak out. And because it is easy for these factories to cut and run, vanishing across national borders and abandoning workers, many people are hesitant to organize unions or demand a living wage.</p>
        <p>The Worker Rights Consortium and the student anti-sweatshop campaign challenge companies like Nike not only to let the public know the conditions in apparel factories, but to begin long-term change.</p>
        <p>Will the debate about sweatshop conditions move beyond the specifics of monitoring and toward establishing the right to organize? Phil Knight's withdrawal of money from the University of Oregon sends the signal that his company is resisting a move in that direction.</p>
