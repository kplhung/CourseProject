        <p>Dee Dee Weiman, the All-Star pitcher for the Tampa Bay FireStix, and catcher Michelle Venturella of the Akron Racers were laughing about the public relations mishap the Women's Professional Softball League narrowly avoided yesterday.</p>
        <p>During an appearance on NBC's ''Today,'' Dot Richardson, the shortstop for the 1996 gold medal-winning United States Olympic softball team, came within a whisper of hitting a line drive through the window of a vintage 1937 Rolls-Royce Phantom III.</p>
        <p>The car -- which was featured in the movie ''Goldfinger'' and will be auctioned at Christie's East next week -- was on display outside NBC Studios at Rockefeller Center.</p>
        <p>Richardson, Weiman and Venturella were promoting a 9-city, 11-game exhibition series featuring the four teams from the women's pro league and the United States women's national team by playing a pickup game with the ''Today'' hosts, Katie Couric and Matt Lauer.</p>
        <p>''We finally get great media exposure and Dotty nearly breaks an office window and a car window in one shot,'' Venturella said.</p>
        <p>Although softball is not considered as popular as women's soccer, the sport is played by more than 7.2 million girls and women compared with 4.9 million who play soccer, according to a 1998 survey by the National Sporting Goods Association.</p>
        <p>Weiman said the only thing that separates the two sports is national exposure.</p>
        <p>''Softball has just as great personalities as soccer does,'' said Weiman, the first player in the four-year-old league history to record a perfect game. ''We feel we're just as competitive and as exciting to watch as soccer, yet soccer has media attention. It's just going to take something similar to what happened with the World Cup for people to catch on to what a really great sport women's softball is.''</p>
        <p>The tour, which will run concurrently with the league's regular season, begins June 2 in Chattanooga, Tenn., and concludes with a three-game series in Honolulu in August. This may be the jump-start the sport has been looking for.</p>
        <p>The tour will showcase some of the world's best professional and Olympic softball players, including several members of the 1996 Olympic team -- Richardson, Lisa Fernandez and Michele Smith -- along with Venturella and the Akron first baseman Crystl Bustos, the 1998 W.P.S.L. most valuable player.</p>
