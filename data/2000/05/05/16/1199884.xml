        <p>For nearly four hours, Palestinians were riveted today by the spectacle of Israeli troops on Ramallah's northern outskirts furiously trading automatic-weapon fire with gunmen -- many of them members of uniformed Palestinian security forces.</p>
        <p>''Games,'' tersely commented a Palestinian officer in the red beret and camouflage of the military intelligence services. ''Games between them and us.''</p>
        <p>The Israeli Army said a detachment of the Palestinian military police had initiated the exchange, firing live ammunition from a hilltop at Israeli troops who had been battling stone-throwing youths with rubber-coated metal bullets and tear gas.</p>
        <p>As the shooting increased, two Israeli Apache helicopters suddenly swooped into view, detonating aerial flares in loud but harmless bursts of smoke and light. Crowds of Palestinian onlookers, mistaking the flares for bombs, scattered in fright.</p>
        <p>Then the gunfire abruptly stopped. The Palestinian snipers decided that they would no longer shoot, knowing that the helicopters could spot their positions, veterans of Ramallah street battles patiently explained. The Israelis, too, held their fire.</p>
        <p>Sensing that the moment would last, Red Crescent ambulances that had been trapped on side streets set off for the hospital, sirens wailing. An independent Palestinian human rights group later said that 375 people had been wounded -- at least 9 seriously -- in today's fighting in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>In Ramallah alone, the scene of the fiercest clashes, 150 people were wounded, the group said. The Israeli Army unofficially reported tonight that it had killed four Palestinians in armed exchanges today: two in Ramallah and two in Nablus.</p>
        <p>Several Palestinians said that the first live bullet had been fired at Israelis by rooftop civilian snipers and that the situation had spiraled out of control when Palestinian troops tried to forcibly disperse Palestinian demonstrators while Israeli troops fired rubber bullets at both.</p>
        <p>To Nader Nasser, 18, who moved here from Redland, Calif., in the waning days of the Palestinian uprising known as the intifada eight years ago, the scene was all too familiar.</p>
        <p>''We shot first,'' he said proudly. ''The Israelis had been using rubber bullets, but once the live bullets came, they said that's enough.''</p>
        <p>But to his equally American neighborhood friend, Ashraf Shatat, also 18, who moved here from Chicago a year and a half ago, today's melee was all new, and disturbing. ''They want to frighten people,'' he said, gazing up as an Israel chopper crossed low over the empty Ramallah street. ''Well, it's working.''</p>
        <p>Israeli Army officials said later that the purpose of the flares had not been to control the crowd, but to deflect small heat-seeking missiles -- an indication of the seriousness with which they viewed the situation.</p>
        <p>Today's violence began as a not uncommon collision between Israeli troops and Palestinian protesters during an annual march to lament Israeli independence and demonstations demanding the release of Palestinian prisoners. But the showdown evolved into a diplomatic and political crisis between the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority.</p>
        <p>''The Palestinian security people are supposed be our partners now,'' grumbled one Israeli intelligence officer. ''Shooting at us in not within the rules of the game.''</p>
        <p>Despite the fear and anger unleashed by today's clashes, an undeniable air of excitement invigorated Ramallah. Hundreds of Palestinians -- most of them young men -- crowded nearby streets for a closer view of the gunfire, with the Israeli soldiers hunkered down behind armored vans and inside a half-built hotel.</p>
        <p>Parked at a gas station not far off, Abdul Razul voiced warm approval of the violence.</p>
        <p>''This is the response of the Palestinian people to 52 years of occupation,'' said Mr. Razul, a grandfatherly 65, gesturing with a satisfied sweep of his arms toward the gunfire crackling in the background.</p>
        <p>''The Palestinians are getting tired of peace talking,'' he said. ''The Israelis aren't giving us anything. The Oslo accords say that they should give us our prisoners, and the Israelis just keep stalling.''</p>
        <p>One young Ramallah policeman, identified as Ahmed Abdel-Fattah, was killed almost instantly by a burst of Israeli gunfire. At least six other policemen were wounded -- one critically -- in the gunfire with Israeli troops, who contend that they were returning fire from the Palestinian police. Israeli Army officers said three of their soldiers in Ramallah today had been treated for gunshot wounds.</p>
        <p>During one furious exchange, Maher Abu Khater, a seasoned West Bank reporter for The Los Angeles Times and the German news agency D.P.A., was shot in the back by a distant Palestinian sniper. He was under treatment tonight in Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem and was reported to be in stable condition.</p>
