        <p>The Army said today that it had no plans to reopen an investigation into an attack made at the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991 by soldiers under the command of Barry R. McCaffrey, the retired Army general who is now President Clinton's drug-policy adviser.</p>
        <p>A report published today in The New Yorker magazine raised several allegations about the attack, in which the 24th Infantry Division pummeled retreating Iraqi forces in southern Iraq two days after a cease-fire took effect.
