        <p>For pop music fans, it is where acts ranging from the heavy metal thrashing of Megadeth to the Christian-inspired crooning of Amy Grant have appeared.</p>
        <p>For boxing aficionados, it is where grown men beat each other senseless once a month.</p>
        <p>For some Fortune 500 companies, it is a glorified boardroom where investors and executives can ogle the latest products, from swimsuit magazines to Internet software.</p>
        <p>And for its managers, the Hammerstein Ballroom is not only all of the above but also a reincarnation of its former self -- a turn-of-the-century opera house that once rivaled the Metropolitan Opera.</p>
        <p>For the past several years, the managers of the ballroom, which is part of an entertainment complex at 34th Street and Eighth Avenue known as the Manhattan Center, have been holding big-ticket shows there even as they try to restore the hall to its original decor, complete with box seats, balconies and a proscenium arch.</p>
        <p>In the process, the once-derelict room has been transformed into a postmodern event hall, a sort of garage sale of popular entertainment set amid the trappings of what many consider to be the most elitist of musical arts.</p>
        <p>As more of the ballroom is recast in its former operatic splendor and an increasing number of spectacles are staged there, the clash of histories becomes even more jarring. It is an intersection of what some people call low and high cultures, with a healthy dose of American kitsch thrown in. Take, for instance, the televised heavyweight boxing matches that have been held in the ballroom since February, or the fact that ''Hollywood Squares'' is expected to tape several shows there in October.</p>
        <p>And if the Roseland, the concert hall in Midtown, closes in the fall, a plan that is being considered by its owners, then the six-story Hammerstein will become the only midsize space of its kind in New York.</p>
        <p>''A big thing about this place is the height, and it has the character of an opera house,'' said Louise Honey, executive vice president of Manhattan Center Studios, the company that manages the complex. ''Other places with our history are not as varied as we are. They try to stay somewhat in the classical world.''</p>
        <p>''Classical'' certainly is not the first word one would use to describe an event like the recent Smashing Pumpkins concert. Billy Corgan, the lead singer, strode out wearing a leather tunic and wielding an electric guitar and belted out lyrics like, ''The killer in me is the killer in you.''</p>
        <p>Such acts appear at the Hammerstein through an agreement that Manhattan Center Studios reached with Metropolitan Entertainment Group, a music promoter. The promoter guaranteed much of the $10 million in loans used for the renovation. In return, the Hammerstein Ballroom agreed to play host to about 50 shows per year.</p>
        <p>The shows help to finance the renovation by bringing in money to pay back the loans.</p>
        <p>Once the debt is paid, Ms. Honey said, the ballroom may stage a different sort of music, one that its founder, Oscar Hammerstein, would undoubtedly have found more melodious.</p>
        <p>''We're really looking at a pretty major musical,'' she said. ''It could really encompass this kind of house. We could do seasons of dance, seasons of opera, seasons of ballet.''</p>
        <p>An opera lover and cigar salesman, Mr. Hammerstein built 10 theaters in Manhattan, earning him the nickname ''the Father of Times Square.'' In 1906, he opened the Manhattan Opera House, the original incarnation of the Hammerstein Ballroom. He also built similar halls in other cities.</p>
        <p>In New York, both the Hammerstein and the New Victory Theater, once called the Republic, still stand. The brash showman also left another legacy: his grandson Oscar Hammerstein II teamed up with Richard Rodgers to reinvent the American musical.</p>
        <p>By staging extravagant productions, the 3,100-seat Manhattan Opera House cut into the audience for the Metropolitan Opera, which suffered its first loss in years during the 1906-07 season, wrote Ken Bloom, a music historian, in ''Broadway'' (Facts on File, 1990).</p>
        <p>In 1910, as Mr. Hammerstein's enterprises led him deeper into debt, he took $1.25 million from the Metropolitan's backers to stop opera production.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Hammerstein's death in 1919, ownership of the Manhattan Opera House eventually passed to the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, which renamed it the Manhattan Center. In midcentury, it served as a meeting hall for unions and for political groups.</p>
        <p>The Unification Church bought it in 1976 and renamed the old opera space the Hammerstein Ballroom. By then, major structural changes had taken place: a new ceiling had been built beneath the third balcony; the box seats had been torn out; and a meeting hall called the Grand Ballroom had been added above the original theater.</p>
        <p>The former opera house languished as a storage area and an employee parking garage while Manhattan Center Studios rented out the Grand Ballroom and adjacent recording studios.</p>
        <p>Then in 1996, Ms. Honey decided that the opera space would make an ideal site for a proposed fashion show. But much work would have to be done first.</p>
        <p>''The idea behind the renovation was that here was a 100-year-old opera house where great culture came from,'' she said. ''The company was thinking about making money, as it should. But for some people, it was the dream of bringing this place back to life.''</p>
        <p>One of those people was Alistair Farrant, an audio engineer who recreated the ceiling mural. The original painting depicted an orchestra of angels on a heavenly stage, but it had become caked with layers of grime.</p>
        <p>Working in the adjacent New Yorker Hotel, Mr. Farrant created an oil painting on 16 canvases. But he added a splash of modernity to the original design. His most radical stroke was changing the ethnicities of some of the angels to ''represent what New York City is today,'' he said. A black security guard at the center was immortalized as a violinist, and an Asian-American receptionist took wing as one of the angels.</p>
        <p>Other renovations followed and the Hammerstein opened for concerts and corporate parties in 1997.</p>
        <p>The ballroom's hodgepodge of spectacles has added a patchwork feel to some of the renovation. A coat-check stand was bought from Lexus after a company party, as were neoclassical sets designed for a 1998 Burt Bacharach concert that now decorate the basement.</p>
        <p>As for future work, Manhattan Center Studios expects to add a neon marquee to the exterior, install third-tier balcony seats and add more wall moldings, Ms. Honey said.</p>
        <p>Some architectural purists might sneer at certain aspects of the renovation. For example, the original slanted floor for the orchestra was replaced with a level concrete surface. And partitions that once separated the box seats have not been replaced.</p>
        <p>But Andy Hammerstein, the family historian and great-great-grandson of Oscar, has supported the project. ''I'm happy with it because it's in its time,'' Mr. Hammerstein said. ''You can begrudge them for what they did, but they did what they had to do. Theater is temporal.''</p>
