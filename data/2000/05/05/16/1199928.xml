        <p>Rashard Casey, Penn State quarterback, pleads not guilty to charges that he and Desmond Miller, who are both black, severely beat and kicked white off-duty police officer Patrick Fitzsimmons in what authorities say may have been bias-related incident, Hoboken, NJ (M)</p>

        <p>Having finished the 1999 season with a strong performance in Penn State's 24-0 rout of Texas A&amp;M in the Alamo Bowl in December, Rashard Casey was poised for his first full season as the starting quarterback this fall.</p>
        <p>But Casey's future on the field and off is in doubt after he and a former high school teammate were arrested here in their hometown early Sunday on charges that they severely beat and kicked an off-duty police officer in what the authorities say may have been a bias-related incident.</p>
        <p>Casey, who is free on $5,000 bail, entered a not guilty plea on an aggravated assault charge during an arraignment in State Superior Court in Jersey City this afternoon.</p>
        <p>His co-defendant, Desmond Miller, 22, of Jersey City, who has an arrest record, remained in the Hudson County Jail in lieu of $20,000 bail.</p>
        <p>Chief Carmen LaBruno of the Hoboken Police said Casey and Miller first encountered the off-duty officer, Patrick Fitzsimmons, who is white, with an unidentified black female acquaintance at River Street, a bar and dance club at Hoboken and River Streets. Eventually, all four ended up outside.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Miller and Mr. Casey took exception to the African-American female being with a white male,'' LaBruno said. He said that Miller threw the first punch and that Fitzsimmons ''was then hit in the face by Casey, and he fell and was kicked in the face by Casey.''</p>
        <p>The police responded to the scene, where they found Fitzsimmons, 34, unconscious. Casey was arrested as he walked in the direction of his apartment. Miller was arrested as he got into a cab several blocks away, LaBruno said.</p>
        <p>A man who answered the telephone at Miller's home who identified himself as a relative said the family had no comment. Casey, who spent the afternoon with his parents, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Casey's lawyer, Dennis McAlevy, said the assault charge was concocted by LaBruno to attract attention to himself. McAlevy also said the department was trying to minimize embarrassment for Fitzsimmons, who lives in Hoboken and is married to a woman other than the one he was with.</p>
        <p>He is also the brother of James Fitzsimmons, a Hoboken police lieutenant and city councilman. The Fitzsimmonses could not be reached.</p>
        <p>''Rashard Casey never punched anybody, he never kicked anybody,'' McAlevy said. ''He was there when it happened, then he left.''</p>
        <p>LaBruno denied McAlevy's allegations, saying evidence against Casey included his bloodstained work boots and the testimony of five witnesses.</p>
        <p>Frank Spano, the Hoboken High School principal, said he was puzzled by the allegation of bias because the mother of Casey's son is Hispanic.</p>
        <p>The woman, Melodie Alvarado, 21, said that while she and Casey were no longer together, he is a caring father who has never been biased against whites or any other group.</p>
        <p>Alvarado, who declined to characterize Miller, also said that Casey had never been violent toward her or anyone else.</p>
        <p>''I can't believe that Rashard Casey could do such a thing,'' said Spano, who declined to talk about Miller. ''That's the sad thing. He has been an inspiration to so many of the players on the team now. They look up to him.''</p>
        <p>William Mahon, a spokesman for Penn State, where Casey, a fifth-year senior, was to have started summer classes today, said the charges would be weighed independently to determine what action the university would take. Casey is on full athletic scholarship.</p>
        <p>Jeff Nelson, a spokesman for Penn State's athletic department, said that Coach Joe Paterno was aware of the arrest and that an assistant coach had spoken to Casey on Sunday.</p>
