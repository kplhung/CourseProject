        <p>Bruce Vilanch, who has written scripts for dozens of award shows and variety shows and supplied patter for celebrities, has become known as something of a Hollywood laugh-dispenser, a 24-hour grocery of  wisecracks, show biz in-jokes and snippy bons mots. ''Got any lines?'' is the question Mr. Vilanch, in his new one-man show, ''Bruce Vilanch: Almost Famous,'' says he is perennially asked. Interestingly, he's not referring to cocaine.</p>
        <p>If you are wondering about what makes these credentials worthy of an evening of theater -- Mr. Vilanch has written for the Osmonds, among others, and even the Oscars aren't exactly known for consistent drollery -- it's a good question. For the show, which is running through June 10 at the Westbeth Theater Center, is not so much a theatrical presentation as a party at which the funniest kid in the class is expected to be the center of attention.</p>
        <p>''I have no act,'' Mr. Vilanch says early on, an invitation to criticism that won't be accommodated here. The idea is that the audience is eager to hear him reminisce in a chatty, off-the-cuff fashion about the backstage antics of Bette Midler, Cher and the like, and that's a bit of an assumption. To judge from his enthusiastic reception at a recent performance, there is an audience for the kind of inside scoop he can provide, a niche market in diva flapdoodle. But the world in which Mr. Vilanch travels isn't all that -- what's the word? Significant? And anyone who brags about writing the script for the Miss Black Teenage Utah pageant is at least a bit self-trivializing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vilanch, a paunchy, hirsute fellow who has the look and demeanor of a weird, antisocial child that Santa Claus's parents kept hidden in the attic, enters in a sequined T-shirt designed to suggest an evening gown, bare-shouldered and in bad taste. ''Hi, I'm Linda Tripp,'' he says, then sings a campy song about gay men who work in the wardrobe and wig departments. He is accompanied by an onstage pianist, Dick Gallagher, who is otherwise deployed throughout to no substantial effect.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vilanch's show is organized along vaguely autobiographical lines. Against a backdrop of pastel-colored T-shirts pinned to the wall, many of them in children's sizes -- ''Michael Jackson's laundry,'' he explains -- he speaks about growing up as an ungainly boy in Paterson, N.J.; doing some modeling (for Lane Bryant) and acting; and his early career as a journalist in Chicago, where he met Ms. Midler 30 years ago while writing about her nightclub show.</p>
        <p>From then on, apparently, his life followed one long, upwardly mobile path from variety show to awards show to movie bit to movie subject (the recent documentary about him is called ''Get Bruce!'') to the apparent pinnacle, as head writer and frequent guest on the game show ''Hollywood Squares.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vilanch does have some amusing stories to tell, most of them vulgar. There's one about Tallulah Bankhead and flatulence that would be priceless if he learned how to tell it more economically for the stage and not as though he were holding court at a drunken dinner party. But his best lines (unprintable here) are those he recounts as delivered by others, namely Sophie Tucker and Paul Lynde, the latter of whom he describes as having been dull when sober, incredibly charming and funny on one drink ''and on two drinks, Josef Mengele.''</p>
        <p>Jewish and openly gay -- ''Now you have to get up and say, 'I'm Spartacus,' '' he says, with some appropriate scorn, about the social pressure to declare one's sexual credentials -- he delivers some otherwise standard-issue material about gay pride and Jewish stereotypes in Hollywood. Much of the second act depends on questions from the audience.</p>
        <p>Over all, the evening yields insight only into the blandness of Hollywood-style entertainment. This is the kind of storytelling that relies far too much on the presumption of a man who is quite used to being told, ''Oh, you're so funny,'' by people who have a stake in its being so.</p>
