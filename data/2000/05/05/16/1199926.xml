        <p>United Press International, the 93-year-old wire service that has struggled for years with red ink and a succession of owners, has been bought by a news affiliate of the Unification Church, company officials announced today.</p>
        <p>News World Communications Inc., which publishes The Washington Times and was founded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the leader of the Unification Church, acquired U.P.I. for an undisclosed sum, executives from both companies said.</p>
        <p>Larry Moffit, special assistant to the president of News World Communications, said his company would not interfere with the editorial autonomy of the wire service.</p>
        <p>''U.P.I. will maintain its editorial independence and build on its reputation for honest, fair-minded reporting that has made it an essential and respected news agency for generations,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In its heyday, U.P.I. was the chief rival of The Associated Press and had a stable of future industry leaders -- including Walter Cronkite and David Brinkley -- who scored a number of scoops.</p>
        <p>In 1963, Merriman Smith, U.P.I. White House correspondent, first told the world of the assassination of President Kennedy by refusing to share a press phone in the motorcade with his counterpart at The A.P. Mr. Smith went on to receive the Pulitzer Prize, one of 10 given to the agency.</p>
        <p>Troubled by dwindling profits in recent years, U.P.I. twice declared bankruptcy and endured a nearly continuous stream of layoffs and asset sales. The agency changed hands three times in a decade, passing from the Mexican publisher Mario Vazquez-Rana to California venture capitalist Earl Brian and then, in 1992, to its most recent owner, a company controlled by the brother-in-law of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <p>Arnaud de Borchgrave, U.P.I.'s president and chief executive officer, will remain in his current position, Mr. Moffit said. Dong Moon Joo, the president of the Washington Times Corporation, will become chairman of the U.P.I. board of directors.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Borchgrave, who notified his staff of the purchase this afternoon, voiced optimism about the sale, which he said would not result in any layoffs. There are currently 157 U.P.I. employees, he said.</p>
        <p>''I protected every single job,'' said Mr. de Borchgrave, who said he fended off an offer that would have laid off the entire staff and moved the headquarters to London.</p>
        <p>Negotiations will begin in the next few weeks to sell U.P.I.'s headquarters building in downtown Washington, where the agency leases space, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Borchgrave expressed no reservations about working under the corporate control of the deeply conservative Unification Church. Mr. de Borchgrave, a former Newsweek correspondent, served as editor-in-chief of The Washington Times until 1991, and complained of no ideological meddling while there.</p>
        <p>''Not once in all my seven years as editor-in-chief was I given any suggestions of any kind,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moon, a South Korean evangelist, built a corporate empire of hundreds of companies and a religious following known for mass weddings and aggressive recruitment practices. News World began publishing The Washington Times nearly two decades ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moon served a year in prison after he was convicted in 1982 of failing to report $162,000 in income on his federal tax returns. He said the unreported funds actually belonged to his church and accused the government of singling him out for his religious beliefs.</p>
        <p>While the paper has never challenged the much larger Washington Post in circulation, it has become a touchstone for capital conservatives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moffit said News World Communications will encourage executives at U.P.I. to continue to expand their Internet services, while also seeking to provide ''customized'' news in such fields as national security, family issues, religion and morality and science and technology.</p>
