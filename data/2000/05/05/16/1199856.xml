        <p>The sound of helicopters flying over the Kingston ghettos was not the kind of buzz the producers of ''Third World Cop'' had in mind before this movie's hometown opening here last summer. But with life intimidating art, the premiere of this violent tale about a hardened police officer named Capone who is fighting ghetto gunrunners, was postponed for two months while the police and soldiers engaged in deadly battles against heavily armed gangs.</p>
        <p>The filmmakers wanted to be sensitive to complaints that it was not the right time for movie mayhem while there were real-life clashes in the streets. The military occupation that followed led some Jamaicans to denounce what they called the routine use of excessive force in some of the country's poorest and most violent neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Capone would have understood the drastic measures. He dispenses bullets and justice with an icy gusto that makes Dirty Harry look like Mahatma Gandhi. And he would just glare at his critics -- film, social or otherwise -- and remind them, ''We run things, things don't run we.''</p>
        <p>Whatever qualms anyone had about Capone's tactics apparently vanished by the time the movie opened in October; it went on to become Jamaica's highest grossing movie. Yet the success of a film about a take-no-prisoners lawman comes at the very time when Jamaicans are grappling with the issues of rampant urban violence and police brutality. Last summer a newspaper poll revealed that 26 percent of Jamaicans were so fearful of crime that they said the police should shoot known criminals on sight. At the same time advocacy groups have been calling for official inquiries into the role of the police in several violent incidents.</p>
        <p>''Third World Cop,'' the movie and its protagonist, reflect that dual pull, occupying the same nebulous territory in the minds of many Jamaicans.</p>
        <p>The story line is of a bad man who is a good guy and who can answer the gunmen and criminals on equal terms and come out well. Barry Chevannes, dean of the faculty of social science at the University of the West Indies, said: ''There is a feeling among some people, and it may sound contradictory, that on the one hand police tend to be brutal and hostile in many inner-city communities. On the other hand, you get the very same people demanding strong action.</p>
        <p>''In the last 25 years or so there have emerged cops who have had that kind of an aura about them, of a very strong man, some of whom become legends in a way. They can deal with criminals, but people are obviously ambivalent.''</p>
        <p>What has happened is that people can identify with Capone and Ratty, his childhood friend, whose desperation leads him into a gunrunning scheme.</p>
        <p>''Everybody is so individualistic down here, everybody thinks of himself as the hero,'' said Chris Browne, the film's director. ''That's why we have such a hard time playing football, because nobody can pass the ball to the next person to win. In Jamaica, everybody wants to be a star. They look up to the novelty of a bad man. That is because there is a certain thing in society here where people identify with the bad man. He is the guy who takes the bull by the horns and knows he's going to end up dead in a glorious way.''</p>
        <p>The movie was inspired by the flamboyant exploits of a real-life police officer who was an acquaintance of the film's producer, Carolyn Pfeiffer. Through conversations with other police officers and tag-along rides with special squads, the filmmakers learned how guns were smuggled from the United States in barrels and hidden in Jamaica.</p>
        <p>While many things they observed made it into the final film, some did not. For instance, the role of the island's political parties in arming gangs of partisans who turned the ghetto streets into war zones in the 1970's and 80's is only touched upon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Browne said he was asked to stay away from politics. ''To me, it was a difficult thing to write a movie about the inner city and guns without writing about politics,'' he said, ''because they go hand in hand. We touch on it, obviously not referring to any party.</p>
        <p>''Politics is like talking religion in Jamaica. People kill themselves talking religion in the world. In Jamaica they do it over politics.''</p>
        <p>What people do see in the film is a glimpse, simplified and prettified by the casting of several famous dancehall music D.J.'s, of the dead-end life that is all too common in the slums of Kingston. It is a real world inhabited by characters like Ratty, who forsakes the hard work needed to become a D.J. to make a fast dollar smuggling guns. While Ratty is undoubtedly a bad guy, his plight resonates strongly among younger Jamaicans who know that many employers will not take a chance on anybody with a ghetto address.</p>
        <p>''That icon of the bad man in Jamaica, hustling to make things happen for himself is very big,'' said Mark Danvers, who portrays Ratty. ''Everybody can identify with that man. He is held up in the songs and in the way that people in their early 20's carry themselves. That is the man, the anti-state, ant-conformist fellow because there is a deep distrust of the state. Lie after lie, failure after failure and nothing ever gets better despite the fact that people do work hard, nothing gets better.''</p>
        <p>The filmmakers also wanted to show the pressures that the police are under as they confront a country that has been awash in guns for decades and is now under the sway of dons, some of whom have escaped the control of political leaders and allied themselves with drug dealers. At times the situation has grown so chaotic that the police have to enter neighborhoods under the protection of armored personnel carriers. Nevertheless selling the idea of a tough cop as a good guy is a daunting task in a society where news broadcasters qualify attacks on the police as alleged confrontations.</p>
        <p>The $500,000 budget for the digital video production dictated that some scenes, including those showing the heartwarming side of villains, had to be left out, though there are hints of the side when Capone begins to question his ways.</p>
        <p>The Jamaica that is portrayed in the movie is not one that most tourists or many middle-class Jamaicans will ever encounter. And while it seems like a cartoon shoot 'em up at times, it retains an essence of truth for many who know the hard-luck life of ghetto residents.</p>
        <p>''Once people see themselves, that makes people think, if nothing else,'' said Carolyn Gomes, a doctor who is a founder of Jamaicans for Justice, an advocacy group active in low-income areas.</p>
        <p>''Perhaps it will make those who are not so aware of life in the ghetto a little more aware,'' she said. ''And hopefully it will allow you to take a step back and see if that person is the person you want to be, or if you want to do anything differently. That's the function of all art, to see things in a different way.''</p>
