        <p>Letter from Laurel Harvey says her participation in Million Mom March was intended to send message to National Rifle Assn that 'enough is enough' and that she, a registered Republican, will vote for whichever presidential candidate is first to support sensible gun laws</p>

        <p>Re ''Mothers Rally to Assail Gun Violence'' (front page, May 15): I attended the Million Mom March in Washington. I had not planned to, and I knew no one who was going, but the day before I surfed the Web and noticed there were eight buses leaving from a local shopping center at 6 a.m. All seats were reserved, but I went stand-by. The first bus was full;  the second had one no-show.</p>

        <p>Re ''Mothers Rally to Assail Gun Violence'' (front page, May 15): I attended the Million Mom March in Washington.

The first bus was full;  the second had one no-show.</p>
        <p>I am a registered Republican who votes by issues, and my presence at the march was not intended as a political statement. It was a moral stance. To the National Rifle Association, I say, along with the other marchers, ''Enough is enough.''</p>
        <p>I intend to write my representative and senators in support of child-safety locks, the registration of all handguns and the licensing of all handgun owners. Which candidate,  George W. Bush or Al Gore, will be the first to support sensible gun laws? That candidate will earn my vote.</p>
