        <p>On a drizzly  afternoon here, Dr. Luis F. Baptista, 58, an enthusiastic man with dark hair and the accent of his native Macao, was showing a New York visitor the ins and outs of daily life in this city's Golden Gate Park.</p>
        <p>''This is where a white crowned sparrow I used to know once lived,'' Dr. Baptista said, pointing to an ornamental African aloe tree. ''She was very dominant to her husband, whom she beat up on all the time. However, one day, she divorced him, moved to a different tree a few hundred feet away and married another guy who then beat up on her. I couldn't understand what she saw in him. But they raised more white crowned babies than anyone else in the park. She must have realized there was something special about the new guy, in terms of evolution.''</p>

        <p>On a drizzly  afternoon here, Dr. Luis F. Baptista, 58, an enthusiastic man with dark hair and the accent of his native Macao, was showing a New York visitor the ins and outs of daily life in this city's Golden Gate Park.</p>
        <p>''This is where a white crowned sparrow I used to know once lived,'' Dr. Baptista said, pointing to an ornamental African aloe tree. ''She was very dominant to her husband, whom she beat up on all the time. However, one day, she divorced him, moved to a different tree a few hundred feet away and married another guy who then beat up on her. I couldn't understand what she saw in him. But they raised more white crowned babies than anyone else in the park. She must have realized there was something special about the new guy, in terms of evolution.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Baptista knows all the soap opera details of the lives of Golden Gate Park's birds. As chairman and curator of ornithology and mammalogy of the California Academy of Sciences, based in the park, he has spent a lifetime studying the mating habits, songs and language of birds. The author of some 127 papers on the subject, Dr. Baptista is among the world's leading experts on bird song, dialect and language.</p>
        <p>As he sat under the tree of the much abused and abusive white crowned sparrow, Dr. Baptista speculated about an ancient question.</p>
        <p>Q. In the 1950's rock classic, ''Why Do Fools Fall in Love,'' the singer Frankie Lymon, asked, ''Why do birds sing so gay?'' Do you know why?</p>
        <p>A. They sing, for one thing, because the bachelor male wants to attract a wife. He also wants to show other males that he's pretty studly, that this is his territory and no one is going to cross the boundaries. A third reason is that the song induces the female bird's brain to send hormones: it makes her ovaries grow.</p>
        <p>We can actually show that birds have an aesthetic sense similar to ours. If you take female great reed warblers, stick them with female hormones, put them in a soundproof box and play for them recordings of male songs -- some beautiful and some yuckie -- you will see that they solicit copulation more from the beautiful songs than the yuckie ones. That means that the females actually prefer beautiful songs, even what humans consider beautiful.</p>
        <p>Q. Are there cases when humans, like certain birds, have a sexual response to songs?  A. I suppose there are. You remember all those Beatles concerts and the girls passing out to the sounds of the Beatles and Elvis Presley? For me, it's Montserrat Caballe. When she sings, I feel like I've gone to heaven.</p>
        <p>Q. Do you think, as it has sometimes been suggested, that birds sing for the pure pleasure of it?</p>
        <p>A. There is a possibility. Konrad Lorenz [the Austrian zoologist] had a jackdaw, and he said that when the bird would have a nice meal and was relaxed and had no stress, it would sit on a tree and sing. It would use all the calls in its vocabulary and he would do these movements like a Shakespearean actor doing a soliloquy. And Lorenz suggested it was a form of play. So in that sense, I would say that it is quite possible that birds -- when they are happy, well fed, without stress, without predators -- sing just because they feel good.</p>
        <p>Q. Haven't you also noted that some birds are instrumentalists?</p>
        <p>A. Oh, absolutely. The black palm cockatoo actually shakes a piece of stick that it uses as a drumstick. Then, it holds it with one foot and bangs it against a hollow log, as he's calling and displaying to attract the female.</p>
        <p>In this country, we have lots of woodpeckers. Woodpeckers peck, of course, to get bugs. But they also peck to make music because they don't have a vocal song like song birds. So what they do is they look for a nice log that makes the correct sound and then, they pound on it with a specific rhythm. This means that tool making is not an exclusive property of humans or other primates.</p>
        <p>Q. Do birds have language?</p>
        <p>A. They don't have a grammar. The definition of a language to a linguist includes grammar, but they do use different sounds that communicate different messages. A chicken, if you show it a picture of raccoon, it will  recognize it as a predator and make a certain clucking sounds and all the other chickens will look around for a raccoon. On the other hand, if you show it a picture of a falcon, it makes a different sound and looks up, which means ''the danger is in the sky.'' Song birds have that too.</p>
        <p>Q. Some scientists insist that the particular sounds that birds make are just instinctive reactions. How would you answer them?</p>
        <p>A. I guess the same could be said for humans then because we instinctively react to certain kinds of sounds, right? I don't see the difference.</p>
        <p>There are some bird sounds produced that are learned. I studied a European bird called the chaffinch and it has a vocabulary of 10, 12  different sounds. But it has different alarm calls. There's one for the hawk flying overhead: ''This is not a serious danger.'' A different call means: ''Let's get the hell out of here.''</p>
        <p>Q. You study bird dialects. Why would a bird have a dialect? Is there an evolutionary reason?</p>
        <p>A. My favorite theory is that the structure of a bird song is determined by what will carry best in its home environment. Let's say, you have one bird that lives in a coniferous forest and another in an oak forest. Since the song is passed down by tradition, then let's say there's an oak woodland dialect and coniferous woodland dialect. If you reproduce the sounds, you will find that the oak sound carries farther in an oak forest than it does in a coniferous forest, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>Q. How did bird dialect and music become your passion?</p>
        <p>A. It started when I was a boy in Hong Kong. I went to teahouses where people kept their song birds on the top floor. The practice enchanted me. I also kept two parakeets and then I had canaries. I had young canaries and I was impatient to get them singing. So I started singing to them. To my amazement, when they were adults, they sang just like me.</p>
        <p>Q. What are the parallels between human and bird music?</p>
        <p>A. I know of birds who have voices with tonal qualities that sound like real instruments. The strawberry finch has beautiful single notes that come down the scale and that sound just like a flute. There is another bird, the diamond firetail from Australia, whose voice sounds like some kind of woodwind, an oboe perhaps. Then, in Costa Rica, I've encountered a wonderful night bird, and it sings four notes coming down the scale, and the quality of its voice is just like a bassoon.</p>
        <p>Then, if you look at pitch, scholars have found that certain birds use the same musical scales of human cultures. One scholar has found that the hermit thrush actually sings in the pentatonic scale used in Far Eastern music. One of the most incredible cases is the canyon wren, who sings in the chromatic scale, and his song reminds me of the introduction and finale of Chopin's ''Revolutionary Etude.''</p>
        <p>Q. How do you tell when convergence occurs? And when is man just  borrowing sounds heard in nature?</p>
        <p>A. In this case, it is really a convergence because there's no way that Chopin ever got to where this bird lives: California. However, there are real cases of borrowing. In the Sixth Symphony in the second movement of Beethoven, you can very clearly hear the three-note call of the European quail and the two-note call of the cuckoo.</p>
        <p>And there's Mozart's starling. Meredith West and Andrew King of the Indiana University have studied Mozart's piece ''The Musical Joke,'' which musicologists have been puzzled by, because it's not really of the quality of Mozart. The horns are playing off key and there are all sorts of strange devices there that offend musicians. West and King kept starlings and they found that starlings do all the things that are found in this piece by Mozart, such as stopping a motif in midsection. And this particular piece was written six days after his pet starling died. Mozart wrote it, we can surmise, as a tribute to his friend.</p>
        <p>Q. I've heard birds sing in what seems like a sonata style. Can they?</p>
        <p>A. They do, in the sense that they have an exposition of a theme. Very often, they have variations in theme reminiscent of canonical variations like Mozart's Sonata in A major, where you have theme and variation. And eventually, they come back to the original theme. They probably do it for the same reasons that humans compose sonatas. Both humans and birds get bored with monotony. And to counter monotony, you always have to do something new to keep the brain aroused.</p>
        <p>Q. Bird song patterns are quirky and cute, but what do they mean?</p>
        <p>A. Well, it doesn't have to mean anything. It's just wonderful that animals and humans can converge.</p>
