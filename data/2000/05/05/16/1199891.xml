        <p>The Brazilian airline Vasp has since January received at least two federal threats to ground its fleet for failure to pay airport fees. Last month I.B.M. seized four of Vasp's mainframe computers and 200 personal computers because of delinquent bills.</p>
        <p>Then came the really bad news.</p>
        <p>Four Vasp MD-11 jets were repossessed two weeks ago, forcing the carrier to cancel all intercontinental flights. And a court order grounded three smaller 737 Vasp aircraft used on the heavily traveled Rio-Sao Paulo route. An appeals judge has temporarily restored the 737's to Vasp's use, but the future of that route, and the airline, is uncertain.</p>
        <p>With debts now estimated at more than $1.8 billion, Vasp is in the worst shape of Brazil's major airlines, with losses last year of nearly $53 million. But Vasp's three main competitors are not healthy either. Varig, the largest airline, lost $54 million last year. Transbrasil lost $50 million. TAM lost a record $74 million.</p>
        <p>Their predicament reflects what the industry executives call the hostile financial and regulatory environment for air transportation in Latin America's largest economy. All the airlines have asked the government to make drastic changes in the country's aviation policies to ensure that the domestic industry will survive stronger international competitors.</p>
        <p>''The government has to do its part, not just to reduce costs, but to stimulate the entrance of new capital or new carriers in the Brazilian market,'' said Claudio Toledo, an economist and aviation consultant.</p>
        <p>It is not clear how quickly the government will respond to the industry's requests. But there is widespread agreement that the Brazilian airline industry is in the midst of its worst crisis in recent years. The devaluation of the real, Brazil's currency, in January 1999 increased the industry's dollar-denominated debt load by 30 percent overnight. Fuel and leasing costs were similarly affected, at a time when economic weakness kept many Brazilian travelers at home. According to Brazil's Department of Civil Aviation, demand for international air travel fell about 14 percent in 1999, causing all of the major carriers to cancel or reroute flights.</p>
        <p>As part of an effort to halt the losses, TAM and Transbrasil completed a code-sharing agreement a few weeks ago, which will initially reduce by 16 the number of Transbrasil's daily flights between Rio and Sao Paulo. As a result, the company will return six leased aircraft. Although the two companies say that the agreement is simply a business partnership, industry experts expect the airlines to merge eventually.</p>
        <p>Varig, which dominates the international market, has taken steps to cut costs. Last year it returned 14 leased planes and laid off employees.</p>
        <p>Last Friday, Swissair said it was talking to all four Brazilian carriers about possible alliances that could lead to an equity investment.</p>
        <p>The Brazilian carriers insist that they cannot return to health on their own. One of their biggest complaints is that government-imposed price ceilings restrict companies from charging variable rates on tickets, one of the most common ways for airlines in the United States to fill planes. Unlike air passengers in the United States, a Brazilian pleasure traveler who books a ticket two months in advance pays the same price as a businessman who buys his ticket at the gate.</p>
        <p>''The pricing structure is frankly archaic,'' said Brigadier Mauro Gandra, executive director of the National Syndicate of Airlines, a trade group. ''If companies could charge business travelers higher ticket prices, they could reduce prices for regular passengers. It would stimulate domestic air travel.''</p>
        <p>Since only 2 percent of Brazil's 165 million people have ever flown, the market has the potential to grow rapidly if the price were right. Indeed, as the economy recovers, industry groups expect the demand for domestic air travel to jump about 10 percent this year.</p>
        <p>Revenue from international routes has helped offset domestic losses. But it is precisely in the international routes where Brazil's lack of competitiveness is most visible. Ten years ago, Brazil's then-flagship carrier, Varig, accounted for 65 percent of international passengers. Today, all four airlines combined account for less than 35 percent.</p>
        <p>In the North American market alone, Vasp, Varig, Transbrasil and Tam offer 50 weekly flights to the United States, while their four main United States competitors -- American, Continental, United and Delta -- provide 101 flights to Brazil.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem is that there are too many Brazilian carriers going after a limited number of international travelers.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't make sense to have four different companies flying internationally,'' said Fernando Pinto, the president of Varig. ''We aren't competitive and it's the country that winds up losing.''</p>
        <p>With Vasp's international cutbacks, Mr. Pinto said Varig's occupancy rate on international flights had already started to creep up. He said an eventual merger of Tam and Transbrasil would help as well.</p>
        <p>Aviation workers' unions have expressed concern, though, that a decreasing number of airlines would mean far fewer jobs and would turn the industry into an anticompetitive cartel. They argue that the government must devise a way to help companies be more competitive, while providing incentives for new capital to enter the market.</p>
        <p>''The companies themselves have the conditions to be efficient,'' said Graziella Baggio, president of the National Aeronautics Union. ''But financing costs, leasing costs, airport costs, taxes are all too high.''</p>
