        <p>A veteran police officer has been suspended for impeding the investigation into the fatal shooting of a man at a Queens intersection Saturday, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>A GMC sport utility vehicle owned by the officer, Angela Willis, was being driven by a man suspected of killing the victim, Derrick Gilmore, the police said. Mr. Gilmore, 31, of  Jamaica, Queens, was shot repeatedly as he sat in his Ford Explorer at 10 a.m. on Saturday at the corner of 38th Avenue and 21st Street in Long Island City.</p>
        <p>Witnesses told the police that they saw a man pull up behind Mr. Gilmore in Officer Willis's vehicle, step outside and fire at least five shots, striking Mr. Gilmore in the torso. He died an hour later at Elmhurst Hospital Center.</p>
        <p>The gunman escaped in Officer Willis's vehicle, which was found later that morning parked outside the Queensbridge Houses on Vernon Boulevard, where Officer Willis lives, the police said.</p>
        <p>Officer Willis, 36, a 10-year veteran on the force, saw detectives clustered around her vehicle and demanded to know what they were doing, the police said. Under questioning, the authorities said, she told them that she had misplaced the vehicle and lost her keys and that she did not know whether anyone had been driving it.</p>
        <p>When the police searched her apartment, they found her police identification and her badge. She then told the detectives that she was a police officer, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police said that Officer Willis refused to answer any questions after she identified herself as a police officer, and was immediately suspended without pay. She could not be reached for comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>The police said that a 9-millimeter handgun had been used to kill Mr. Gilmore and that five 9-millimeter shell casings had been found on the ground near Mr. Gilmore's Explorer. Officer Willis carries a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, the police said, and the authorities seized it from a locker at the 23rd Precinct station house on East 102nd Street in East Harlem, where she is assigned.</p>
        <p>Sgt. Andrew McInnis, a police spokesman, said that it did not appear that Officer Willis's weapon was used in the crime and that she was not considered a suspect in the killing. He said detectives were searching for a male suspect and did not know whether he had any connection to Officer Willis.</p>
        <p>''The witnesses, who gave us the vehicle description and plate number, said it was a male driving the GMC, and a male who shot the victim,'' Sergeant McInnis said. ''We believe it was a male who committed the murder.''</p>
        <p>A woman who identified herself as Mr. Gilmore's cousin declined to comment in detail yesterday, saying the family was busy making funeral arrangements. ''The fact that she was a police officer, we don't really care,'' she said. ''Right now, we're grieving.''</p>
