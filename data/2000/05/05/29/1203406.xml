        <p>They all knew by the second inning, all the hitters. Pedro Martinez was pitching and Roger Clemens was pitching and, on this night, there did not seem to be a bit of difference between the two, except that Clemens happened to be striking out batters with more frequency. Everybody knew by the second inning that one run could win last night's game at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>Clemens and Martinez were both throwing hard, they were both dominating, both aiming at a made-for-television strike zone, and good swings were scarce. But after 8 innings and 2 outs, after 13 strikeouts, Clemens turned on the mound, raised his chin and watched Trot Nixon's long fly ball rise and fall, the ball disappearing in the throng in the right-field stands, the decisive hit in a memorable duel. The Red Sox won, 2-0, although Martinez (8-2) had to survive a scare in the bottom of the ninth inning.</p>

        <p>They all knew by the second inning, all the hitters. Pedro Martinez was pitching and Roger Clemens was pitching and, on this night, there did not seem to be a bit of difference between the two, except that Clemens happened to be striking out batters with more frequency. Everybody knew by the second inning that one run could win last night's game at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>Clemens and Martinez were both throwing hard, they were both dominating, both aiming at a made-for-television strike zone, and good swings were scarce. But after 8 innings and 2 outs, after 13 strikeouts, Clemens turned on the mound, raised his chin and watched Trot Nixon's long fly ball rise and fall, the ball disappearing in the throng in the right-field stands, the decisive hit in a memorable duel. The Red Sox won, 2-0, although Martinez (8-2) had to survive a scare in the bottom of the ninth inning.</p>
        <p>''It was a classic,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager. He added that he hoped ''it puts to rest all the questions about Roger.''</p>
        <p>The Red Sox won two of three games in this series and departed with a one-game lead in the American League East. The Yankees come away believing that Clemens (4-5), mostly an enigma in his time in pinstripes, is capable of greatness. They all saw it.</p>
        <p>''I've lost plenty of close ones, and won plenty, too,'' he said afterward. ''I wanted to go longer than two or three innings, like the last time.''</p>
        <p>Clemens lasted only two innings in his playoff duel against Martinez last October, surrendering five runs and straining his lower back before Torre and the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre decided it would be better if Clemens came out and did not exacerbate his injury. Torre and Clemens never discussed that game again, but the manager knew Clemens was badly disappointed; you could see it in his eyes, Torre said.</p>
        <p>Surrounded by reporters the other day, Clemens quickly severed conversation about that afternoon. ''I just pitched poorly and we'll leave it at that,'' Clemens said. ''There's no reason to rehash that and go back to that.''</p>
        <p>Clemens's nature is to look ahead, but several weeks ago he actually went back in time to make a significant adjustment to his pitching mechanics, reverting to the delivery he used while with the Red Sox.</p>
        <p>Rather than hold his glove and right hand at chest level at the outset of his motion, Clemens began it by pumping his hands over his head. He has felt more comfortable since making that change. His rhythm is better.</p>
        <p>There also was a practical reason for the alteration -- Clemens might have been tipping off his pitches to hitters. Holding his hands at chest level, he sometimes raised his glove a little higher before throwing the forkball. Hitters could watch his glove and make an educated guess about whether he was throwing a fastball or a forkball. Now his pitches are disguised better. He has more time to set his grip. Going into last night's game, Clemens had struck out 29 in his last 29 2/3 innings and won three of his last five decisions.</p>
        <p>So he took his Red Sox style to the mound against the Red Sox, and has never had better stuff since joining  the Yankees, his fastball sailing, his forkball plunging, his slider veering. He whiffed at least two batters in five of the first seven innings, finishing some with 95-mile-an-hour fastballs while others flailed at his forkball as it splattered in the dirt.</p>
        <p>Fifteen months ago Yankee executives gathered on short notice at a restaurant in Tampa, Fla., to discuss a trade of Clemens for David Wells and two others, and when they unanimously agreed, this is what they envisioned: Clemens dominating.</p>
        <p>Carl Everett rolled a single through the middle one out into the second inning. Before Clemens threw a pitch to Mike Stanley, he attempted three times to pick off Everett -- and got him on the third. Clemens threw exactly one pitch from the stretch in the first eight innings.</p>
        <p>Clemens was actually better than was Martinez, who allowed two hits to Derek Jeter and had prolonged battles with Chuck Knoblauch, who hit the ball hard twice. But the Yankees could not score, going hitless in four at-bats with runners in scoring position. In their last 90 at-bats against Martinez, the Yankees have 10 hits and 44 strikeouts.</p>
        <p>The hitters were in trouble, and if they did not fully comprehend this going into the game, they certainly knew in the first inning. With the count three balls and two strikes to Nixon, Clemens whipped a fastball off the outside edge of the strike zone -- a called third strike, according to the home-plate umpire, Ed Rapuano. Nixon paused and stared before walking off. Later Nixon said Clemens screamed at him that the pitch was a strike. ''I don't know if I said anything to Trot,'' Clemens said. ''I talk to myself a lot out there.''</p>
        <p>Rapuano had to be replaced after the fifth inning, after a foul ball slammed against his right knee. But Paul Runge, who stepped in for Rapuano, kept the strike zone wide, and hitters on both sides were griping. But the star pitchers were going to be the stars of this nationally televised game, which turned into a feast of strikeouts.</p>
        <p>Nixon blistered a triple in the seventh, but Clemens responded, striking out Brian Daubach, who seemed to be laughing at the call as he walked away, and Nomar Garciaparra, for the third time. No score.</p>
        <p>Nobody scored in the eighth either, and both pitchers entered the ninth inning knowing it would probably be their last inning.</p>
        <p>Clemens retired the first two in the ninth, but then Jeff Frye chopped a grounder to the mound, the bounder skipping off Clemens's glove and rolling to his right. Base hit.</p>
        <p>Nixon was next. Clemens hurled a high fastball, and the sound of contact was all anybody needed to hear. There were small noises in Yankee Stadium, the Red Sox in their dugout, the minority of Red Sox fans. The Red Sox led, 2-0.</p>
        <p>But Martinez hit Knoblauch with a fastball leading off the bottom of the ninth, and Jeter rolled a single to right. Yankee Stadium was brimming with hope. Then Paul O'Neill struck out.</p>
        <p>Bernie Williams was next. He lifted a high fly toward right, the way Nixon had done, and Torre and others rushed forward to the front of the Yankees' dugout; Torre thought it was gone. But Nixon caught the ball just in front of the wall.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch tagged up and moved to third. With Jorge Posada batting, Jeter swiped second, and then Martinez hit Posada with a breaking ball. Bases loaded. Many fans were standing, Yankee fans, Red Sox fans.</p>
        <p>Tino Martinez topped a fastball toward second, an easy roller, but Frye double-clutched, waiting for Mike Stanley to get to first, before finally tossing and barely nipping Martinez to end the incredible duel.</p>
