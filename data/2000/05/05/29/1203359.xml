        <p>Central Park is gorgeous right now -- moist and lush and shimmering with health. Especially breathtaking are the thick, deep green lawns, the dust bowls of a few years ago, that cost millions of dollars to restore and now look as luxurious as Aubusson carpets.</p>
        <p>No wonder the anticipated number of visitors this year is up to 20 million -- an increase of at least 5 million over the last few years. No wonder so many of them want to treat it like a vastly superior extension of a backyard, lolling on the grass and walking dogs. Jogging and roller-skating. Strumming guitars and beating drums.</p>
        <p>In other words, messing the place up. Littering, making noise and trampling the exquisite grass. The problem with the lovely new Central Park is that people love it so much. Before, when it was considered dangerous and rundown, it was not such a big deal that musicians amplified their sound or soccer players tore up the grass with their cleats or dog owners did not always clean up.</p>
        <p>But now, after spending $250 million on the park -- mostly money raised by the Central Park Conservancy, founded in 1980 and now one of New York's most prestigious philanthropies -- the city is getting fussy about it.</p>
        <p>''When it was a shambles, it didn't really matter what you did on it,'' said Henry J. Stern, the Parks and Recreation commissioner. ''For a long time, the rules were ignored. But now, after 20 years and millions of dollars, we have a safe park, a clean park, a nice park, and keeping it like that means some restrictions.''</p>
        <p>And some resentment.</p>
        <p>''I refer to it as a grass museum,'' said David Gibson, who has two children in the West Side Soccer League, an after-school program that had to bus children to Wards Island while Central Park's North Meadow was restored.  Marc Freedman, president of the league, said he feared that its 3,500 children between 5 and 15 would not be able to return to the park, given the heavy competition for slots on the playing fields. ''The Conservancy is not as friendly towards kids' sports,'' he said. ''I want to have beautiful grass for the kids to play on, but for me the priority is for kids to play. For them, the priority is nice, green grass.''</p>
        <p>The city's other priority seems to be enforcing long-ignored rules.</p>
        <p>The rules are not new. Musicians have long been forbidden to be too noisy or to use loudspeakers without permission. Permits have long been required for gatherings of 20 or more people, as well as bonds that can be revoked if the area is not properly cleaned up. It has always been illegal to litter or to let dogs run free outside official runs.</p>
        <p>But this spring, the city is clamping down. First, there were the wars over leashing dogs. Signs announcing $100 fines for littering are soon to go up. And this month, the city has been ordering the park's musicians and dancers to lower the volume and perform less often.</p>
        <p>Some, like the Jazz Blues Ensemble and David Ippolito, who calls himself That Guitar Man, have been playing in the same spots for years, acquiring loyal fans and even becoming minor tourist attractions. Others, like the skaters who dance to amplified rock music and the African drummers at Bethesda Fountain, provide the kind of colorful scenes that New Yorkers and tourists -- some of them, anyway -- say makes the city vibrant and worth visiting.</p>
        <p>Adam Kaufman, a Central Park Conservancy official, who was at Bethesda Fountain on Saturday trying to disperse the drummers, said: ''We've made the park beautiful. Now we want to to make it beautiful to all the senses, including hearing.''</p>
        <p>But fans of the music say it raises their spirits and creates a rare, precious urban community.</p>
        <p>''This is what's best about New York,'' said Lynn Walsh, who has gathered with about 20 other drummers at the fountain for six years.  ''This park, the outdoors, the beauty. Most of all the feeling of love.''</p>
        <p>The city says it gets many complaints about the drumming every year. A few weeks ago, the police told the drummers to stop playing and confiscated seven African drums.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, turned up at Bethesda Fountain to try to work out a compromise that would let the drummers play. ''Usually, we sue,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''But this time we're trying to mediate. This is a great park and we don't need ugly scenes.'' He added that Mr. Kaufman and other conservancy officials are not supposed to make policy or enforce park regulations, and complained that Mr. Kaufman appeared to be doing just that.</p>
        <p>The issues that are tugging at Central Park today -- noisy music versus peace and quiet, lawn as landscape versus lawn as carpet, orderliness versus freedom -- were controversial from the beginning.</p>
        <p>When Frederick Law Olmsted, the park's legendary creator, inaugurated free band concerts in 1859, there was ''great resistance,'' said Witold Rybczynski, author of ''A Clearing in the Distance,'' a biography of Olmsted. ''Literally tens of thousands of people went,'' Mr. Rybczynski said in an interview. ''But for a long time they weren't allowed to sit on the grass. Rich people would sit in their carriages. Everybody else had to stand.''</p>
        <p>Because Central Park ''looks like nature,'' visitors often forget they are in a fragile, artificial environment, he said. ''People think they're in the country and, within limits, are free to do what they want. It feels wrong to have rules -- it looks so natural, like the Garden of Eden. But the park is very delicate. If people all start walking on grass or littering, that's it. Sound can really carry and spoil things for other people.''</p>
        <p>But balancing the enforcement of park rules is equally delicate, he said. Being too lenient can result in visitors' impinging on one another and damaging things. Being too rigid drives people away, potentially worsening the neglect of the park. ''Parks only exist because people go there,'' Mr. Rybczynski said.</p>
        <p>Central Park began its decline during the 1960's, when people began avoiding it for fear of being mugged. The slide was arrested after the Central Park Conservancy raised hundreds of millions of dollars to rehabilitate it, calling on the wealth of nearby residents.</p>
        <p>Now the challenge is to keep people from loving Central Park to death, and to persuade them to share it. Mr. Stern has asked drummers and musicians who use amplifiers to use the band shell. But the musicians and their regular listeners object to the formality and sterility of the concrete stage, preferring the intimacy of the lawn or lakeside.</p>
        <p>''Drums are part of my culture,'' said Rose Brito, 34, who said she was Irish and Puerto Rican. ''To me, the noise touches my soul. The louder it is, the more free I feel.''</p>
        <p>Tony Hiss, who writes about parks and open space, suggested that a ''sound map'' be made, to find relatively enclosed areas for music.</p>
        <p>But preventing hundreds of thousands of feet from stamping the grass blades into mulch is tougher. One solution might be to spread the wealth, and renovations, to other parks, like Riverside, Prospect, Van Cortlandt and dozens of others, said Mark Caserta, an employee of the Parks Council, a nonprofit advocacy group for the city's parks.</p>
        <p>The conflicts over music and silence should be worked out case by case, Mr. Rybcyznski said. ''That makes it a political hot potato,'' he said. ''But simply banning music doesn't seem right. The park clearly requires cooperation. We've gotten very bad at compromise in our society. But the park clearly requires compromise.''</p>
