        <p>The Liberty players say they have nothing to prove this season. They sound sincere but not entirely convinced.</p>
        <p>The Liberty will begin the fourth season of the Women's National Basketball Association as the defending Eastern Conference champions. Twice in the past three years, the Liberty has been one game short of a championship. Four of the team's veterans were picked to play in the league's inaugural All-Star Game last season.

        <p>The Liberty players say they have nothing to prove this season. They sound sincere but not entirely convinced.</p>
        <p>The Liberty will begin the fourth season of the Women's National Basketball Association as the defending Eastern Conference champions. Twice in the past three years, the Liberty has been one game short of a championship. Four of the team's veterans were picked to play in the league's inaugural All-Star Game last season. And it is the Liberty, the team ridiculed for lacking pizazz and stars, featured in the league's 2000 promotional advertisements.</p>
        <p>But the Liberty is not picked to finish first or second in the East and is doubtful to be among the four teams from the conference making the playoffs. The favorites in the East are the Washington Mystics, led by Chamique Holdsclaw, last season's rookie of the year, Nikki McCray, Vicky Bullett and Tausha Mills, this season's rookie sensation. The Charlotte Sting and Cleveland Rockers have been deemed likely contenders with the Orlando Miracle also improved.</p>
        <p>The Liberty -- with the league's oldest starting lineup and uncertainty at the center position -- is given an outside shot at finishing third.</p>
        <p>''Last year, we were picked fourth with Rebecca Lobo,'' Liberty Coach Richie Adubato said. ''Any time you make a team an underdog, that is a tremendous motivational tool for a coach to reach players and get them to play harder.''</p>
        <p>He may have to.</p>
        <p>Lobo -- who missed all but the first 42 seconds of last season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee -- tore the same ligament while working out in December and will be out of the lineup until July. Kym Hampton, the team's 37-year-old All-Star center, felt so good after arthroscopic surgery on her knee last summer that she came out of retirement. But the knee began swelling during training camp and Hampton retired again on Friday.</p>
        <p>Adubato had hoped to rely on Tamika Whitmore, the 6-foot-2-inch power forward who rose above expectations during her 1999 rookie season. But Whitmore arrived in camp 42 pounds overweight and has only shed 18 pounds in the past two weeks. ''She probably won't be able to help us win games until after another two or three weeks,'' Adubato said.</p>
        <p>Until Whitmore is able to contribute, Adubato will go with Shea Mahoney, the 6-2 rookie forward from Western Kentucky, as his sixth player. The coach is also looking into the possibility of the center position ''being done by committee.''</p>
        <p>The three vying for the job are Olga Firsova, the 6-6 Kansas State center who was the team's No. 1 draft pick, the 6-5 Alessandro Santo de Oliveira of Brazil and Venus Lacy, the spirited 6-3 veteran who saw limited action last season but who has impressed Adubato with her aggressive play in camp. Yesterday, the Liberty acquired forward Tari Phillips from the Portland Fire for guard Carolyn Young, who was not expected to play until July because of a knee injury.</p>
        <p>If the Liberty is to repeat as division winners, it will do so behind veterans like the All-Star guard Teresa Weatherspoon, the team's emotional leader, and the All-Star forward Vicky Johnson, who led the Liberty last season in minutes per game (33) and points (13.3). Sue Wicks, coming off her best year as a pro, and the clutch-shooting Crystal Robinson, who led the league in 3-pointers with 76, will also be expected to step into big roles.</p>
        <p>''We've been told we're too old, that we needed an overhaul,'' said Weatherspoon, 35; Wicks is 34 and Johnson is 28. ''We take that as a challenge.''</p>
        <p>Coming off an 0-3 preseason, the Liberty will be tested early. The team opens the season today against the defending champion Comets in Houston. Three of the Liberty's next four games are away against Phoenix, Washington and Detroit.</p>
        <p>But even a good start will matter little if the Liberty fades down the stretch. To avoid getting run down in a season that has been condensed to accommodate the Summer Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, Adubato will most likely look to Becky Hammon, the 5-6 guard who provides an instant spark off the bench, and Jessica Bibby, the team's fourth-round pick from Australia.</p>
        <p>The Liberty's trademark is defense and hustle. In the end, the key to the Liberty's success this season may well be its desire to prove all the naysayers wrong.</p>
        <p>''During the off-season,'' Johnson said, ''I talked to players around the league who said: 'The Liberty. You guys aren't that good.' A lot of players in the West said that. But we're the only team in the league that beat Houston three times last year.''  PRO BASKETBALL</p>
