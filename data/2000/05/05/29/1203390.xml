        <p>No player with as many career home runs as Mark McGwire has homered with such frequency. If you are a pitcher, sooner or later, the St. Louis Cardinals' first baseman will get you.

        <p>No player with as many career home runs as Mark McGwire has homered with such frequency. If you are a pitcher, sooner or later, the St. Louis Cardinals' first baseman will get you. He took Glendon Rusch deep two years ago, on a pitch Rusch tried to throw inside but left over the middle of the plate.</p>
        <p>Rusch threw inside to McGwire again today, as he did to many of the Cardinals. It was an effective strategy, and it produced a 6-2 victory for Rusch and the Mets, who swept the first-place Cardinals and have won 8  of their last 10 games.</p>
        <p>Rusch, who had been given an average of fewer than two runs per start this year, finally received some run support, and he did not waste it. The left-hander worked seven innings, allowing two runs on five hits and walking one to improve to 2-4.</p>
        <p>''They say the ball is juiced, but I think the hitters have caught up to the pitchers' pattern,'' catcher Todd Pratt said. ''We like to pitch middle-away now, and no one pitches inside consistently anymore. If they do, they can't consistently throw strikes inside. As hitters, we know we're going to get our pitch.</p>
        <p>''Today, Glendon just kept on pounding inside and pounding inside. When they thought he was going to go away, he came back inside.''</p>
        <p>Todd Zeile, Edgardo Alfonzo and Pratt had homered off Darryl Kile to give Rusch a 4-1 lead by the time he faced McGwire with a runner on first and no outs in the fourth. Pratt never moved his glove as Rusch froze McGwire with an 89 mile-an-hour fastball. McGwire moved his body as if the ball had come too far inside, but the pitch was an obvious third strike.</p>
        <p>After going 1 for 4 today against Rusch and Armando Benitez, McGwire finished 3 for 11 in the series, with no home runs. Every other team that has faced McGwire three times this year has allowed at least one home run. ''We tried to stay in on him and tie him up,'' Rusch said. ''He's an unbelievable hitter, as far as getting to a lot of pitches. Fortunately, he didn't beat me today.''</p>
        <p>Rusch said he tries to take the same aggressive approach no matter the score. But pitching with a lead, which Rusch had not done in four starts, helped make him more aggressive, he said. It was an idea impressed on him by the Mets left-hander Al Leiter.</p>
        <p>This is Rusch's fourth major league season, but he said he feels like a rookie. ''That's good for me,'' the 25-year-old Rusch said. ''It keeps me open-minded and helps me be a sponge.''</p>
        <p>Like Rusch, Leiter is left-handed, but the similarities end there. Leiter is a hard thrower who works inside to hitters; Rusch throws softer and usually to the outside part of the plate. But Rusch has sought out Leiter and the Mets' other veteran left-handers for advice, and Leiter told him he can make his outside pitches better by letting hitters know he can also come in.</p>
        <p>''Act like this little bump out here is mine, and I'm going right after you,'' Leiter said he told Rusch. ''You don't have to throw 95 miles per hour to be intimidating.''</p>
        <p>Rusch gave way to John Franco in the eighth inning, and Benitez finished off the Cardinals with a five-pitch, 1-2-3 ninth. The victory completed the Mets' second consecutive weekend sweep of a first-place team; last week at Shea Stadium, they took three in a row from the National League West-leading Arizona Diamondbacks.</p>
        <p>The Mets are 12-5 against teams that currently have a winning record; they are 16-17 in all other games. The Mets' only losses in their last 10 games have been one-run defeats to the San Diego Padres, a last-place club.</p>
        <p>''We just have to make sure we don't take anything for granted,'' said Zeile, who had two homers Saturday and was 3 for 4 today. ''We should have won at least one of the ballgames in San Diego. We let a couple of games get away from us when we were flat. I don't think we were flat here at all.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>GLENDON RUSCH was 0 for 19 in his career before lining a single to center in the third inning Sunday. Rusch scored on a two-run homer by EDGARDO ALFONZO, who has a 13-game hitting streak during which he is batting .392. . . . JOHN FRANCO struck out all three Cardinals he faced Saturday and worked a scoreless inning on Sunday. He said he has been helped by an increased workload, but another left-hander, RICH RODRIGUEZ, would not cite his lack of work for his recent struggles. Pitching for the first time in a week on Saturday, Rodriguez faced three Cardinals, walking two and allowing a single, before being removed. His earned run average is a season-high 9.43. ''It's only May, and I am going to turn it around,'' Rodriguez said. ''It is going to get better; it will happen soon.'' . . . After using the long reliever PAT MAHOMES and four other relievers in a 12-8 victory on Saturday, the Mets promoted the right-hander JIM MANN from Class AAA Norfolk. First baseman MARK JOHNSON, who was 1 for 9, was sent down. Mann, a power pitcher with more strikeouts than innings pitched, had allowed only one run in his last 17 1/3 innings at Norfolk. The 25-year-old Mann did not sleep from the time he got the call, at 1:30 a.m., until he got on a flight to St. Louis at 9. ''It was probably the best feeling I've ever had,'' said Mann, who soaked his new Mets cap in the clubhouse sink so it would fit just right, signed autographs and could not stop grinning. ''I've dreamt about calling her my entire life and saying, 'Mom, I just got called up.' She started crying.''</p>
