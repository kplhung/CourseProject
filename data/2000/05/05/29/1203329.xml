      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Midway in his impressive showcase of new music by rising younger theater composers at the Triad, the tenor Michael Winther made the distinction between a composer and a songwriter. Debra Barsha, one of those whose work he was presenting, he said, insisted on being called a songwriter. Such distinctions are worth pondering when scanning a field in which younger composers like Adam Guettel, Ricky Ian Gordon and Michael John La Chiusa are following the lead of Stephen Sondheim and consciously blurring the boundaries of Broadway, opera and art song.</p>
        <p>Mr. Winther, who has appeared on Broadway in ''1776'' and ''Damn Yankees,'' and off Broadway in ''Dream True'' and ''Forever Plaid,'' has a voice that also traverses genres. Endowed with a strong, appealing folk-pop voice, reminiscent of the young Don McLean, he also displays the range, ballast and discipline of a trained theater singer. Mr. Winther's singing actually gains strength as he reaches into a clear, expressive head voice, maintaining perfect enunciation and control.</p>

        <p>Midway in his impressive showcase of new music by rising younger theater composers at the Triad, the tenor Michael Winther made the distinction between a composer and a songwriter. Debra Barsha, one of those whose work he was presenting, he said, insisted on being called a songwriter. Such distinctions are worth pondering when scanning a field in which younger composers like Adam Guettel, Ricky Ian Gordon and Michael John La Chiusa are following the lead of Stephen Sondheim and consciously blurring the boundaries of Broadway, opera and art song.</p>
        <p>Mr. Winther, who has appeared on Broadway in ''1776'' and ''Damn Yankees,'' and off Broadway in ''Dream True'' and ''Forever Plaid,'' has a voice that also traverses genres. Endowed with a strong, appealing folk-pop voice, reminiscent of the young Don McLean, he also displays the range, ballast and discipline of a trained theater singer. Mr. Winther's singing actually gains strength as he reaches into a clear, expressive head voice, maintaining perfect enunciation and control.</p>
        <p>Accompanied on piano last Sunday night by Jennifer Giering (two of whose well-made songs were showcased), Mr. Winther performed a ballad-dominated program that swung from accessible art song (Mr. Gordon's ''I Am Cherry Alive,'' a delightfully exuberant setting of a Delmore Schwartz poem) to pure pop playfulness. ''New York Makes Me'' and ''Perfect Strangers,'' 80's pop parodies (with music by Ms. Barsha and lyrics by Ira Gasman and Stuart Ross) from ''Radiant Baby,'' a musical work in progress about Keith Haring, were both laugh-out-loud funny. A pair of country-flavored theater songs, ''Hill Country'' and ''Hear That Music,'' by Lewis Flinn and Joe Simon from a show called ''Democracy,'' conjured a pungent quasi-rural nostalgia.</p>
        <p>The most romantic material belonged to Mr. Gordon (his new song, ''Tell Me,'' an anguished reply to ''Some Enchanted Evening'' decked out in film-noir chromatic harmonies) and Mr. Guettel (''Hero and Leander'' and ''How Glory Goes''). ''Glory,'' from the musical ''Floyd Collins,'' has already gained status as a contemporary classic.</p>
        <p>The show will be repeated at the Triad, 158 West 72nd Street, Manhattan, tonight and on June 5 and 12.</p>
