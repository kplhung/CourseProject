        <p>New York preceded most cities in experiencing the historic drop in crime that has swept across America's urban areas and spurred an economic renaissance in many once-devastated neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>But while crime in New York remains at a 30-year low, city officials have worked hard in the last year trying to allay fears that the city may be headed back to the days when more than 1,500 homicides a year were not uncommon.</p>
        <p>By the end of 1998, the city's murder rate had dropped to its lowest point since 1964. But after a decline in homicides to 629 in 1998 from 2,245 in 1990, New York is beginning to record a slight increase, police statistics show.</p>
        <p>Although all other major categories of crime have continued to decline, there have been 269 homicides this year, compared with 248 at the same point last year, police records show. And several recent crimes -- a woman attacked by a man with a brick in Midtown last fall, a spate of killings of cabdrivers and the slayings of five people last week at a Wendy's restaurant in Queens -- have drawn intense attention, suggesting that the perception, if not the reality, of a dangerous city may be returning.</p>
        <p>Homicides, in fact, are down 62 percent compared with 1993, police records show. ''When things are going well, sometimes the shock is so large because you have told people they don't have to worry about crime,'' said Thomas A. Repetto, chairman of the Citizen's Crime Commission, a police watchdog group in New York City.</p>
        <p>While some law enforcement officials say domestic violence, gang killings and a growth in the juvenile and young adult population most often linked to murders are responsible for the two-year spike in homicides, Andrew Karmen, a sociologist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, said,  ''There is nothing you can point to and say that 'this is the culprit.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Karmen said economic, demographic and other factors are  playing a role in the murder rate's increase, leading to questions about the extent to which law enforcement has suppressed violence. In New York, officials have credited smart and aggressive police work for the crime rate's decline.</p>
        <p>Most experts agree that in many respects, the New York police have become victims of their own success: the declining crime rate has raised expectations and created statistical lows that will serve to highlight any future increases.</p>
        <p>''There is a tremendous amount of fear,'' Mr. Repetto said, ''because you've told yourself crime is not a problem.''</p>
        <p>But Yolanda Jimenez, the deputy police commissioner who handles community affairs, said city officials have been educating people about crime trends. ''We have had a challenging four years,'' she said. ''But in spite and despite all that, the large crime reductions have really paved the way for people to deal with issues like quality of life and programs for young people.''</p>
