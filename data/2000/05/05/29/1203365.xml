        <p>Israeli soldiers today fired on Lebanese and Palestinian civilians throwing stones and trying to push across the border from what was until last week the Israeli-controlled buffer zone between the two countries. Four people were wounded.</p>
        <p>Also in southern Lebanon, a Hezbollah fighter killed a Christian man, and two Lebanese children were killed and seven people wounded when their car drove over a land mine on a road.</p>
        <p>The events underlined the potentially deadly confusion and tension that still reign in much of southern Lebanon, four days after Israel abruptly withdrew its forces from the nine-mile-wide area it occupied for 18 years.</p>
        <p>Although a parade of Lebanese government officials have visited the area, the Lebanese Army has stayed away, leaving to the Hezbollah militia the work of policing and of rounding up abandoned Israeli weapons.</p>
        <p>Hezbollah, which waged a long war against Israel and its Lebanese allies in the south, has deployed hundreds of its fighters to prevent looting and pursue members of the South Lebanon Army who worked for Israel during the occupation.</p>
        <p>The guerrillas have sought to present themselves as mere custodians of southern Lebanon, until the government takes over. But its ability to act as a civil guard has been sorely tested, as the unruly scenes at the border fences have shown.</p>
        <p>At Kafr Kila, where the shooting by Israeli soldiers occurred, barely 15 yards separate Israeli guards and the throngs of Lebanese and Palestinians who have come to gawk, shout insults and sometimes throw stones over the border since the pullout.</p>
        <p>A Hezbollah official did not make an appearance until late in the day, hours after Israeli soldiers had lobbed smoke bombs over the fence and fired on Lebanese and Palestinians protesters. Once there, he urged demonstrators to stop throwing stones and trying to cross the border.</p>
        <p>The Israeli Army said it had wounded at least two Lebanese demonstrators, one of whom managed to cross the border and plant a Hezbollah flag.</p>
        <p>''The Israeli force at the scene called repeatedly on the civilians to leave the area,'' the army said in a statement, according to Reuters. ''When they did not obey, the force responded with a stun grenade and then with shots aimed at the lower body.''</p>
        <p>The secretary general of Hezbollah, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, has said it is to be expected that after so many years of occupation, Lebanese would express hostility toward the Israelis.</p>
        <p>But Sheik Nasrallah has also sought to reassure the Christians who live in the former security zone, including those who may have had family members in the South Lebanon Army or who may have worked in Israel, that Hezbollah intends to protect all Lebanese.</p>
        <p>In the village of Qlaia, two of Sheik Nasrallah's deputies, Sheik Naim Qassem and Muhammad Raed, publicly tried to reassure Maronite Christian residents after their priest canceled Sunday Mass.</p>
        <p>''He who attacks the residents of Qlaia attacks Hezbollah, and he who violates the people of the south violates the resistance,'' Mr. Raed told villagers outside the church.</p>
        <p>The priest, after meeting with the two Hezbollah representatives in private, later celebrated Mass.</p>
        <p>It was not clear what led to the killing of a Christian man in the village of Rmeiche earlier in the day.</p>
        <p>Some villagers told reporters that the killer was a Hezbollah fighter who wanted revenge on the dead man's family, which included members of the South Lebanon Army.  Others said the killer had opened fire on a crowd.</p>
        <p>Hezbollah denied any involvement.</p>
