        <p>Esther Kim, the tae kwon do player who gave up a possible spot on the American Olympic team so that her injured best friend could compete, has been invited by the International Olympic Committee for an all-expenses paid trip to the Summer Games in Sydney, Australia in September, the I.O.C. said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the I.O.C., phoned Kim in Houston and invited her to Sydney in honor of what he called a selfless act of sportsmanship, the I.O.C. said. ''It's the right thing to do,'' said Franklin Servan-Schreiber, a spokesman for the I.O.C. ''We are very proud of her and the spirit of fair play that she demonstrated, and we want her to come to the Olympic Games to support her friend.''</p>

        <p>Esther Kim, the tae kwon do player who gave up a possible spot on the American Olympic team so that her injured best friend could compete, has been invited by the International Olympic Committee for an all-expenses paid trip to the Summer Games in Sydney, Australia in September, the I.O.C. said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the I.O.C., phoned Kim in Houston and invited her to Sydney in honor of what he called a selfless act of sportsmanship, the I.O.C. said. ''It's the right thing to do,'' said Franklin Servan-Schreiber, a spokesman for the I.O.C. ''We are very proud of her and the spirit of fair play that she demonstrated, and we want her to come to the Olympic Games to support her friend.''</p>
        <p>Last Saturday, Kim, 20, reached the finals of the flyweight competition in the United States tae kwon do trials in Colorado Springs. She was to face her best friend, Kay Poe, 18, a gold-medal favorite who had dislocated her left kneecap in the semifinal round of the trials. Poe wanted to fight, but Kim forfeited instead, saying she did not think it was fair to challenge an opponent who was incapacitated. Both players are coached by Kim's father, Jin Won Kim, who has also been invited to Sydney by the I.O.C., which will pay the expenses.</p>
