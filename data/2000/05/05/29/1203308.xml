        <p>At first, the furor over Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's personal life might have seemed like the ultimate publicity blitz for two New York journalists rushing to complete biographies of the mayor.</p>
        <p>Both books were scheduled for publication by late summer, just as the Mayor's Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton would be gathering steam. But now that Mr. Giuliani has announced his withdrawal from the race, publishing experts wonder if the books have lost their urgency and are doomed to being ignored.</p>
        <p>The writers are two New York journalists who have covered the mayor for years, Wayne Barrett, an investigative reporter for The Village Voice, and Andrew Kirtzman, a political reporter for New York One, a local cable TV news station.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kirtzman said that he was working on the final chapters of his book, ''Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City,'' the day Mr. Giuliani announced his withdrawal from the Senate race. Upon hearing the news, he immediately called the publishers, William Morrow Press, an imprint of the News Corporation's  HarperCollins unit.</p>
        <p>''They were mesmerized by the events at City Hall,'' he said. ''If anything, they were even more excited about the book. National awareness and curiosity about Giuliani has been enhanced by his operatic departure.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kirtzman said he would revise his introduction, and in his final chapter track the mayor as he agonized over his final decision.</p>
        <p>Laura Leonard, a spokeswoman for Morrow, said the company had not yet decided how many copies of the book would be printed.</p>
        <p>''Of course we're disappointed he dropped out of the race, but he is still a national news figure,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett said he has added chapters to include this month's roller coaster ride for his biography, ''Rudy: Gotham's Goliath,'' for Basic Books, an imprint of the Perseus Books Group.</p>
        <p>''Rudy certainly has a much larger national profile now than when I originally signed the book, much larger even than a month ago,'' he said. ''But he's no longer running against the first lady, and that's got to have some effect on the interest in the book in other parts of the country.''</p>
