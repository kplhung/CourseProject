        <p>Instead of playing golf today, Tiger Woods spent the afternoon watching rain.</p>
        <p>The final round of the Memorial Tournament was suspended until Monday after rain saturated Muirfield Village Golf Club and made it impossible to continue. This is the second time in four years that the Memorial's fourth round has been pushed back to a Monday.</p>
        <p>Play was suspended at 11:15 a.m., long before the leaders could tee off. When play resumes Monday at 8 a.m., Woods (17 under par, 199) will hold a commanding six-stroke lead over Steve Lowery (11 under par), and a seven-stroke lead over Justin Leonard (10 under par). So while Woods wanted to finish today, he did not feel he would lose momentum after shooting a nine-under-par 63 on Friday and a seven-under-par 65 on Saturday.</p>
        <p>''You're not going to lose your entire game in one day if you're playing well,'' Woods said. ''You're not going to struggle to break 90 tomorrow. Mentally, you know you need to go out there and get the job done.''</p>
        <p>Asked what he did during the rain delay, Woods said, ''I ate a lot.''</p>
        <p>Corey Pavin and Don Pooley, who played in the first group, were the only golfers who finished today. They shot 71's. Forty of the 80 players in the field failed to complete even one hole.</p>
        <p>Woods, who is the defending champion at the Memorial, will be trying to become the first PGA Tour player to win four times this year. Phil Mickelson, who is not in this field, has three victories this year. Woods has already won the Mercedes Championships, the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am and the Bay Hill Invitational.</p>
        <p>Monday will probably be Woods's last round in competition before the United States Open from June 15 to 18 at Pebble Beach, Calif.</p>
        <p>Woods will not play this week's Kemper Open, nor is he expected to play the Buick Classic (June 8-11) at Westchester Country Club in Harrison, N.Y.</p>
        <p>This is the third Monday scheduled on tour this year, and Woods has been involved in all three. He won at Pebble Beach in February on a memorable Monday, overcoming a seven-stroke deficit with seven holes to play. At the Players Championship in March, Woods lost a Monday final-hole duel with Hal Sutton, who won by a stroke.</p>
        <p>But with Woods holding a six-stroke lead, this Monday finish may not be as dramatic.</p>
        <p>''Not too often I've had a six-stroke lead,'' Woods said. ''If it's calm and soft tomorrow, you'll have to make birdies. If the wind blows, you won't have to go as low.''</p>
