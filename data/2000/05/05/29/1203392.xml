        <p>Storm clouds were about to burst again, but red rose petals showered first, embracing Juan Montoya in victory lane.</p>
        <p>He smiled his milk mustache for 400,000 fans after the winner's annual swig of milk, a 24-year-old from another country and another racing league now understanding the tradition of the Indianapolis 500. Even better, though, Montoya showed he understood the legendary track in his first try and the 84th running of the race.</p>
        <p>He savored the moment for what it was: a dominating victory, regardless of location, regardless of racing league affiliation, just a Sunday afternoon drive spent looking in the rear-view mirror and for the checkered flag.</p>
        <p>''I think it will take time to realize what I just won,'' said Montoya, who became the first rookie to win the Indianapolis 500 since Graham Hill -- like Montoya a success in another series -- in 1966. ''I wanted to win here, like any other race, it's fantastic.''</p>
        <p>Montoya led for an astounding 167 of 200 laps when the Indy 500 finally started after a 3-hour-9-minute rain delay. He won with an average speed speed of 167.607 miles an hour, holding off three late but unsuccessful charges from Buddy Lazier, the 1996 Indy winner, from Laps 161 to 170, and easily finished 7.184 seconds in front of him. Montoya won $1,235,690 of the  $9,476,505 purse.</p>
        <p>''When you win this race, you earn it,'' Lazier said. ''He ran a real good race. They've dominated in the other series. They've won what, 60 percent or something of those races?''</p>
        <p>Montoya is the reigning Championship Auto Racing Teams winner, racing for the Chip Ganassi team that had won the past four CART titles but had not competed at Indy since 1996 because of a feud with the rival Indy Racing League.</p>
        <p>This year Ganassi decided he would be the first CART team since then to come to Indy, shrugging off the boycott by his league that began when Tony George, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway president, formed the rival I.R.L. and required different engine specifications and chassis from CART's.</p>
        <p>Even before storm clouds blew over the track in early morning, the confrontation between the I.R.L. and CART was brewing. When the reigning I.R.L. champion, Greg Ray, snatched the pole away from Montoya last week in qualifying, race day was already billed for a duel between the fledgling league and the one with the better-known stars.</p>
        <p>Montoya and Jimmy Vasser, the 1991 CART series winner, had given the suffering Indy 500 some recognition, if not better competition.</p>
        <p>That was how the other drivers saw it today, much to Lazier's disappointment. With part jest after the race, Lazier said he had hoped the 31 I.R.L. drivers might try to contain the CART drivers.</p>
        <p>''There was very good sportsmanship,'' Lazier said. ''I was hoping the I.R.L. guys would stay with each other. But I got hammered and boxed, and they were all I.R.L. drivers. I wish they didn't have that good of sportsmanship.''</p>
        <p>Fans, however, did recognize the controversy almost as much as they appreciated the driving from CART's Montoya. ''I heard the fans chanting 'I.R.L.! I.R.L.!' '' Montoya said after he had come from victory lane. ''We were here like any I.R.L. teams, we weren't here with a CART flag. I look at myself and I'm just like any other driver out there.''</p>
        <p>But as the Indy 500 is not just another race, neither is Montoya just another driver. He won seven poles and seven races last season in CART. This was his first victory in five races this season and came a day after the Ganassi team flew to Nazareth, Pa., to run a 225-mile race rescheduled because of snow from April. Montoya finished fourth.</p>
        <p>Today he started in second position, and early, when lapping Lyn St. James, he had to avoid her. ''Lyn St. James nearly put me in the grass, that was the closest call in the race,'' Montoya said.</p>
        <p>St. James, however, ended up in a worse place -- on the cement wall. She and the 19-year-old rookie Sarah Fisher bumped coming up on Turn 1 on Lap 74, and St. James crashed, followed by Fisher, cutting short the historical aspect of having two women starting the race together for the first time.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Montoya was building his lead. He passed Ray on Lap 26. Ray crashed into the wall in Turn 1 on Lap 66, and the two-time Indy winner Al Unser Jr. got caught in the debris, which punctured his radiator and forced an early exit.</p>
        <p>Both came back to the track. But Unser decided he was too far behind and retired on Lap 103. Ray's final exit was more spectacular when he crashed after just three more laps.</p>
        <p>Montoya would not be challenged again until Lap 161, following a restart from an accident. Lazier was coming up on him, 0.127 of a second behind Montoya's G Force-Aurora. He passed Montoya momentarily, but Montoya regained the lead by the end of Lap 163, by 0.137 of a second. By Lap 171, he led by 2.506 seconds.</p>
        <p>When Montoya took the checkered flag, Ganassi shouted into his headsets: ''You're world famous!''</p>
        <p>But Montoya just shrugged afterward. He was thrilled, he admitted, to see the fans in the infield and in the grandstands. But he treated it like any other race. ''I feel the same, happier than I was an hour ago,'' he said with a smile.</p>
