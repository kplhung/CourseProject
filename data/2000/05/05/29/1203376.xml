        <p>It wasn't much of a spider, but the pinhead-size critter evidently chose the wrong fist to climb across.</p>
        <p>State Senator William L. Gormley -- former Marine captain, Villanova rugby star and the kind of guy who enjoys jogging before dawn -- was vigorously gesticulating over a plate of fried eggs as he tried to differentiate himself from the three other Republicans running for the United States Senate in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The spider was not helping Mr. Gormley make his case.</p>
        <p>Squish.</p>
        <p>The spider was no longer a distraction.</p>
        <p>With eight days to go before the June 6 primary, an unwieldy pack of Republican candidates is struggling against an epidemic of obscurity. More than 50 percent of potential voters surveyed say they do not even know the Republicans vying for the seat that Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democrat, is trading for retirement.</p>
        <p>But few of the homeowners in Chatham who answered a knock on their door two weekends ago are very likely to forget the sight of a sweat-soaked Mr. Gormley bouncing on their thresholds. In his effort to meet as many voters as possible, Mr. Gormley, wearing shorts and sneakers, was running  -- literally -- door to door.</p>
        <p>''I think this kind of campaigning makes an impression on the voters,'' he said with the kind of grin that proved he knew its shock value.</p>
        <p>No one has ever accused Mr. Gormley of failing to make an impression. A powerful Atlantic City lawmaker who heads the Judiciary Committee in the State Senate, Mr. Gormley, 54, is well known in Trenton for his fiery temperament, intense exchanges and the ability to strategize like a military field commander under siege.</p>
        <p>''Bill doesn't bumble or fumble,'' said Senator Gerald Cardinale, a Bergen County Republican who counts himself a Gormley supporter. ''When he focuses on something he wants to get done, it gets done.'' Beyond his hurricane-size persona, Mr. Gormley has another trait that sets him apart from his primary rivals: a knack for raising money. So far he has collected $2.4 million; Robert D. Franks, the United States representative from Union County who is considered the other front-runner, has raised just under $1.6 million.</p>
        <p>In a race that features three like-minded moderates -- Mr. Gormley, Mr. Franks and James W. Treffinger, the Essex County executive -- and a former Libertarian, Murray Sabrin, Mr. Gormley's stockpile of cash will buy the kind of commercials that makes all the difference in New Jersey, a state that, depending on geography, gets its network television from New York and Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>As the gatekeeper of legislation affecting Atlantic City, Mr. Gormley has benefited from casino industry largess, prompting some to question his fund-raising ethics. Over the years he paved the way for 24-hour gambling and championed another measure allowing patrons to buy chips with credit cards. He pushed through legislation that funnels a tax on gambling revenue into casino expansion, and through his efforts, the state is constructing a $330 million tunnel that will bring patrons to the doorstep of a planned casino.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gormley insists he has never let contributions from gambling executives influence his legislative work. ''Every vote I've ever made concerning casinos has been for my constituents,'' he said. ''That's the standard. Period.''</p>
        <p>While many of his colleagues in the Legislature, both Republican and Democrat, were critical of his style, no one suggested that Mr. Gormley was under the spell of the gambling industry.</p>
        <p>''Listen, if Boeing is the largest employer in your town, are you going to be for them or against them?'' asked Richard J. Codey, the Senate minority leader. ''But on the other hand, if he doesn't agree with the casino people, he'll say so.''</p>
        <p>After 23 years in the State House, Mr. Gormley is eager to move on. Not that he has not tried in the past. A 1989 run for governor went badly (he finished fourth out of four), and in 1994 he lost a vicious congressional fight against Frank A. LoBiondo, a conservative Republican who tried to link him to Gov. Jim Florio and his unpopular tax increases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gormley was better financed  and better known than his rival, but in the end he was overwhelmed by conservatives and gun advocates, who were infuriated by his vote against assault weapons. (In 1991, a year after that well-publicized vote, Mr. Gormley nearly lost his Senate seat to an unknown Republican whose candidacy was largely financed by the gun lobby.)</p>
        <p>This time, Mr. Gormley has turned his stand on gun control into a purple heart. At nearly every public appearance, he reminds people that he was the only Republican to vote for the ban on assault weapons.</p>
        <p>''When I was in the Marine Corps, I fired an M-16, and I've seen the damage they can do,'' he said. ''I don't think we need these weapons in New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gormley has been around guns and law enforcement officials all his life. His father was the sheriff of Atlantic County for two decades, and the family spent most of the year in an apartment attached to the jailhouse, which is still known as Gormley's Hotel.</p>
        <p>Local judges would stop by for lunch, and prisoners would sometimes baby-sit for the Gormley children. For a change of scenery, the Gormleys would summer at the seaside funeral parlor where Sheriff Gormley was undertaker.</p>
        <p>After graduating from law school, Mr. Gormley enlisted in the Marine Corps, where he learned some valuable lessons about the commonweal. When his commander spotted a package of chocolate chip cookies sent by his mother, he chastised Mr. Gormley for not sharing and forced him to consume the entire two-pound box as his unit looked on. In telling the story, Mr. Gormley made it clear he was not knocking the corps. ''I loved being in the Marines,'' he said wistfully, chin cocked high.</p>
        <p>It did not take long for him to pick up the political baton from his father, who was also the local Republican ward leader. In 1975, a week after Mr. Gormley's honorable discharge from the military, he was nominated county freeholder. It was an easy win, and the Gormley name, he said, did not hurt. ''People down there thought the world of my father,'' he said. Two years later Mr. Gormley was elected to the General Assembly, and in 1982, he was elected to the Senate.</p>
        <p>As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Gormley controls all appointments by the governor and judicial nominations. It is a powerful post, and colleagues from both parties described Mr. Gormley as fair, someone who rarely holds up appointments for the sake of politics.</p>
        <p>But fans and foes agree that Mr. Gormley can as graceful as a drill sergeant. Animated and loud, he has a tendency to bring his face within six inches of an opponent's in an argument. Often one hand will grab the other person's arm while his other hand jabs the air for emphasis. He is the kind of guy who delivers unkind words through a game-show host smile.</p>
        <p>Others say his behavior can be disturbing and self-defeating.</p>
        <p>''Bill has a short temper and a long memory,'' said Steve Salmore, a Republican consultant who worked on Mr. LoBiondo's congressional race against Mr. Gormley. ''He's very bright, but he's very pugnacious and has a tendency to polarize people.''</p>
        <p>Supporters call his ferocity an asset. ''He's an ex-Marine, what can I say?'' said his campaign consultant, David Murray. ''He's a passionate and intense guy. You want a laid-back nice guy who equivocates, you can have Bobby Franks. But if you want a risk-taker, someone with courage and character, Bill Gormley's your guy.''</p>
