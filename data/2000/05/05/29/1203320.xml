        <p>Moving to expand its presence in the fast-changing optical networking sector, Lucent Technologies Inc., North America's No. 1 maker of communications equipment, is in advanced negotiations to acquire Chromatis Networks Inc., a small private company, for as much as $5.5 billion in stock, people close to the companies said over the weekend.</p>
        <p>While the talks could still fall apart amid wrangling over price and lingering interest from other companies in Chromatis, including the Nortel Networks Corporation of Brampton, Ontario, one person close to the companies said the likelihood of Chromatis completing a deal with Lucent was ''over 90 percent.''</p>
        <p>If Lucent and Chromatis do cement a deal, it will almost surely be announced in time for the big Supercomm 2000 communications equipment trade show, which begins June 4 in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Based in Herndon, Va., Chromatis makes equipment that pulls together data and voice communications traffic from within a large corporation or among many smaller businesses, and then transmits that information using light waves  across high-capacity optical networks within cities.</p>
        <p>Optical networking transmits millions or billions of bits of information a second using pulses of light, emitted by lasers, rather than pulses of electricity. Most of the advances in optical networking in recent years have applied to so-called long-haul networks that transmit information among cities or across continents. Now, a number of start-up companies, including Chromatis, are developing products to add capacity and flexibility to optical networks within metropolitan areas.</p>
        <p>Lucent has long been a force in optical networking, but in recent years it has appeared to cede its lead among major communications equipment manufacturers to Nortel, Lucent's long-time rival. While Nortel and Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 maker of Internet communications equipment, have been aggressive in acquiring optical networking companies, a deal for Chromatis would be Lucent's first major acquisition of an optical systems company.</p>
        <p>According to people close to the companies, the Chromatis negotiations are being driven by Lucent's senior executives, including Richard A. McGinn, the company's chairman, Patricia F. Russo, chief of the unit that sells equipment to big communications carriers, and Harry L. Bosco, head of the optical unit.</p>
        <p>But one person close to the company said that at least some of Lucent's less-senior technical employees are lobbying internally against such a deal. They prefer the technology of one of Chromatis's competitors, Astral Point Communications, based in Chelmsford, Mass. Lucent already has an agreement to sell Astral Point's equipment under the Lucent brand.</p>
        <p>In many ways, the products from Astral Point and Chromatis are meant to do similar things, but according to communications equipment experts, the two companies systems' have particular strengths in different areas.</p>
        <p>The systems created by Chromatis are thought by some experts to be better at handling traffic transmitted in the language of the Internet, or Internet protocol, while Astral Point's systems are considered more adept at handling a different communications language known as asynchronous transfer mode, or A.T.M.</p>
        <p>Both languages split communications into small pieces of data to transmit them.</p>
        <p>But while the data packets created by Internet protocol are often of different sizes, A.T.M. breaks down communications into pieces of a uniform size, often making asynchronous transfer mode ''cells'' easier to handle than Internet protocol ''packets.'' That is why A.T.M. has become the underlying network protocol of choice for most big communications carriers.</p>
        <p>Data being transmitted using Internet protocol can ride ''on top'' of asynchronous transfer mode, meaning that an Internet e-mail message from Los Angeles to New York might actually be carried on a network that uses A.T.M. While Astral Point's products might be more attractive to big local communications carriers like the Bell companies, the gear developed by Chromatis might be more suitable for Internet service providers.</p>
        <p>While Lucent already has a strong position selling equipment to big telephone companies, it has not been as adept at selling to Internet providers, which may explain why Lucent's senior management seems to be pushing Chromatis.</p>
        <p>In addition to Nortel Networks, Sycamore Networks Inc. expressed some interest in Chromatis, according to people close to the companies, but those discussions appeared strictly preliminary.</p>
        <p>A Lucent spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
