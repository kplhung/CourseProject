        <p>They strode off the court with wide grins and wacky statistics, believing that no matter what happened in the first half, they would prevail against the doomed Portland Trail Blazers. After cruising to a 103-91 victory today, the Los Angeles Lakers also believed they had just stolen the Western Conference finals.</p>
        <p>Not even the Lakers figured on beating the Trail Blazers twice at the Rose Garden, where the Trail Blazers were 5-0 in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Such thinking was as seemingly absurd as Shaquille O'Neal making every free-throw attempt, or guard Ron Harper becoming an inside force with 18 points and 7 rebounds, or Glen Rice scorching the Blazers for 21 points, including 9 in a row to start the third quarter.</p>
        <p>But these are once again the ultraconfident Lakers, who toyed with the Trail Blazers in Game 4 and turned a rugged, evenly matched series into a lead of three games to one in this four-of-seven-game series.</p>
        <p>The Lakers fell behind by 11 points early, cut the deficit to 5 by halftime, outscored Portland by 34-19 in the third quarter and could wrap up the series at home on Tuesday night in Game 5 at the Staples Center.</p>
        <p>''We gained a lot of confidence coming in here and winning two games on the road in a pressure situation,'' said Kobe Bryant of the Lakers, who finished with 18 points after a slow start. ''We just came out in the third quarter, executed and put it on them.''</p>
        <p>O'Neal led the Lakers with 25 points and 11 rebounds, and he foiled the Trail Blazers' strategy of fouling him as often as possible, which began with 5 minutes 53 seconds remaining and the Lakers ahead by 89-77.</p>
        <p>A 52 percent shooter from the line this season, O'Neal made six consecutive free throws and finished 9 of 9 from the line.</p>
        <p>''Excuse me, excuse me,'' O'Neal said as he cleared a path through a crowd of reporters in the Lakers'  locker room. ''The big Maravich coming through,'' he said, referring to Pete Maravich, a career 82 percent free-throw shooter .</p>
        <p>O'Neal added: ''I was talking to my 3-year-old daughter before the game, and all she said was, 'Good luck, Daddy, and bend your knees.' The first one fell, the second one fell, and I just got in a rhythm.''</p>
        <p>O'Neal's mood was as infectious as the Lakers' free-throw shooting. They made 31 of 34 attempts, including 12 straight late in the game.</p>
        <p>After O'Neal made his six free throws in a row, the Trail Blazers also tried to foul Harper, but the veteran also knocked down six straight.</p>
        <p>With his backup Brian Shaw suspended for today's game for leaving the bench during an altercation in Game 3, Harper was forced to play 34 minutes. He hit 6 of 12 shots.</p>
        <p>''They probably still won't start guarding me,'' Harper said. ''They probably still think I'm not out there. But my teammates know I can hit shots, and they got me the ball.''</p>
        <p>Nothing worked for Portland in the second half. Rasheed Wallace, who finished with a career playoff-high 34 points, scored 13 straight during the fourth quarter, but all that did was prevent further embarrassment.</p>
        <p>The Trail Blazers shot 29.4 percent (5 of 17) in the third quarter while the Lakers shot 70 percent (14 of 20).</p>
        <p>''The only thing we have to draw on is that we have the ability,'' Portland Coach Mike Dunleavy said. ''It's not uncharted territory for us. That's the main thing right now. Our focus has to be playing one game right now. You don't look at the whole series unless you're a New Jersey Devils fan. We just have to get one game and bring the series back here.''</p>
        <p>Steve Smith scored 20 points for Portland. Scottie Pippen, who was held to 11 points, managed only 4 in the second half.</p>
        <p>''They broke us down in the second half and we didn't have a chance to make adjustments on defense,'' Smith said. ''We weren't that bad in the second half, it's just that they had guys get hot.''</p>
        <p>Rice, celebrating his 33rd birthday, started the sudden momentum swing in the Lakers' favor, sinking his first four shots in the third quarter. At halftime, the Lakers decided to set more screens to free Rice for more shots and he responded.</p>
        <p>''I had my mind made up I was going to come out and take more shots and give us a spark,'' Rice said.</p>
