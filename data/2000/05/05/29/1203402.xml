        <p>For the longest time tonight, it appeared that Dale Earnhardt Jr. would expand on a distinguished Winston Cup Series rookie season. Instead a far less heralded rookie, Matt Kenseth, quietly upstaged him.</p>

        <p>For the longest time tonight, it appeared that Dale Earnhardt Jr. would expand on a distinguished Winston Cup Series rookie season. Instead a far less heralded rookie, Matt Kenseth, quietly upstaged him.</p>
        <p>Kenseth took the lead on Lap 375 of the 400-lap Coca-Cola 600 and held off Bobby Labonte to win his first Winston Cup Series race before an estimated 183,000 fans at Lowe's Motor Speedway. He celebrated by skidding sideways in the infield across the Lowe's name and then doing a reverse victory lap.</p>
        <p>''My heart started beating pretty hard there near the end,'' Kenseth said. ''I never really thought we had it in the bag until the final two laps. I started getting a little teary. I kind of had to keep my head about me and hit my marks and make sure I didn't mess up any corners.''</p>
        <p>Dale Earnhardt Sr. wound up third. Earnhardt Jr., who has a series-leading two victories this year and led for 175 laps, finished fourth.</p>
        <p>Kenseth said he was ''pretty surprised'' by the victory. ''I'm used to being kind of overshadowed by Dale Jr.,'' he said, noting that Earnhardt beat him in the Busch Series championship the last two years and has defeated him frequently this year.</p>
        <p>Kenseth proved his versatility tonight, dealing with heat and rain over a five-hour-plus race.</p>
        <p>The Coca-Cola 600 is Nascar's testament to endurance and versatility. Not only is it the longest race among the 34 contested this year in the series, but it is also the only one that fully embraces the challenging variances of day and night racing.</p>
        <p>The race began under a brilliant sun at 6:15 p.m. By 7:30, clouds were forming on the speedway's east side.</p>
        <p>The question became whether the leader could reach 200 laps, enough to make the race official in the event it could not be restarted. Earnhardt Jr., the leader, completed his 200th lap at 8:17 p.m. Thirty minutes later, the race was halted by rain.</p>
        <p>Its resumption came 51 minutes later, and it was a different world. For one thing, the track temperature, which read 103 degrees late in the afternoon, was down to 89.4, triggering numerous tire adjustments.</p>
        <p>Jerry Nadeau clearly had the fastest car for most of the race's first half, leading 104 of the 200 laps. His only problem: others had better pit crews. A Nascar rule stipulates that the order on the restart following a caution is determined by the fastest pit stops among those on the lead lap.</p>
        <p>Nadeau led by a wide margin when the second caution came out. He restarted in third place. He easily regained command before the next caution, but was in the eighth spot when full racing resumed.</p>
        <p>Nadeau's pit crew finally did him a small favor on the fourth caution of the race. He improved from fifth to third -- then quickly took the lead.</p>
        <p>As nightfall came, though, his car was not nearly as effective. Nadeau lost all chance of winning once he had to pit shortly after the rain delay ended because of engine trouble.</p>
        <p>Earnhardt Jr. and his father emerged as 1-2. The kid looked for the longest time as if he would win. But then came the last caution flag of the evening, 40 laps from the finish. He lost the pit road battle to Labonte, Kenseth and his father.</p>
        <p>The rain delay allowed one driver to achieve a rarity. Robby Gordon's plan to become just the third driver to compete in the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on the same day -- joining John Andretti and Tony Stewart -- appeared dashed by a rain delay in Indianapolis. But the rain delay here allowed him to take over the No. 13 car for the final 140 laps.</p>
        <p>Still, Gordon was penalized five laps at the restart for working on his car during the rain delay. His team's offense: putting in a seat pad tailored for him. He finished 35th.</p>
