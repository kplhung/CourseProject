        <p>Dominik Hrabty and Karol Kucera led Slovakia to its first World Team Cup title yesterday in Dusseldorf, Germany, coasting to singles victories against Russia, which fielded two players ranked in the world's top 10.</p>
        <p>Hrabty beat a struggling Yevgeny Kafelnikov, 6-4, 7-6 (1), while Kucera followed with a 6-3, 6-2 victory against Marat Safin, one of the tour's hottest players.</p>
        <p>The Slovaks, who dropped only one match between them in the weeklong tournament, kept whistling shots down the line and finding the corners at the $1.9 million event, which featured eight nations split into two groups.</p>
        <p>That was not the case for Kafelnikov and Safin, two players with a chance to claim the French Open, which starts tomorrow.</p>
        <p>The fourth-ranked Kafelnikov, the 1996 winner of the Grand Slam event, and No. 9 Safin helped the Slovaks with their erratic play, giving away too many points.</p>
        <p>Hrabty, ranked 16th, blasted a forehand down the line just inside the left corner at match point to close out the match against Kafelnikov in 1 hour, 18 minutes</p>
        <p>PAVEL WINS IN AUSTRIA: Andrei Pavel, an unseeded Romanian, defeated Andrew Ilie, 7-5, 3-6, 6-2, yesterday in St. Polton, Austria, to win the $425,000 Raiffeisen Grand Prix for his second career tournament title.</p>
        <p>Pavel needed 2 hours 16 minutes to defeat the seventh-seeded Australian.</p>
        <p>N.C.A.A. FINAL SET: Carlos Drada of Kentucky will meet Alex Kim of Stanford in the final of the Natinal Collegiate Athletic Association tennis tournament in Athens, Ga.</p>
        <p>The unseeded Drada upset top-seeded Jeff Morrison of Florida, the defending champion, 6-2, 6-4, yesterday while Kim beat his teammate K.J. Hippensteel, 6-2, 6-7 (1), 6-2.</p>
        <p>Morrison entered the semifinals with a 40-4 record, but one of those losses was a 7-5, 7-5 loss to Drada on March 26</p>
        <p>Morrison, who said his serve was less effective because of a sore back, was attempting to become the first player to defend his title since Georgia's Mikael Pernfors did so in 1985.</p>
        <p>Drada is 29-20 this year and will try to become the first unseeded player to win the singles title since 1997. In the other semifinal match, Kim had six match points in the second set, but Hippensteel rallied from a 5-2 deficit to force a tie breaker. He dominated the tie breaker, but tired in the third set.</p>
