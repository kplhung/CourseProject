        <p>David Auburn's ''Proof'' at the Manhattan Theater Club is a family play of ideas. With intricate twists and turns, it takes a dramatic and comic ride through the lives of a brilliant, deranged mathematician and his two daughters, one of whom has devoted herself to taking care of her father.</p>
        <p>Although this is not Mr. Auburn's first play, it is his first major production and it has been a heady experience for the 30-year-old playwright. ''Proof'' opened last week starring Mary-Louise Parker and directed by Daniel Sullivan. For the author, the sequence of events was quick and stunning: from page to stage in less than two years, and then surrounded by praise from critics and theatergoers.</p>
        <p>In his first extended interview, Mr. Auburn spoke modestly about his accomplishment. He said that he had written the first draft of the play very quickly and, accepting suggestions from his agent and friends, he painstakingly revised it. Then he submitted it to the Manhattan Theater Club. Last April the company had a reading with Ms. Parker playing the central role.</p>
        <p>''She nailed it,'' he said. ''With no prompting and no direction, she surpassed all my expectations and was unafraid to be scary'' and to stress the critical edginess of her character.</p>
        <p>Almost immediately the play was scheduled for this season. With a year to wait -- a year in which his play was still his secret -- Mr. Auburn took a job writing scripts for television documentaries and wrote a new play. He also got married: he and his wife, who is a historian, live in Brooklyn. Before ''Proof'' opened, he won a Guggenheim Foundation fellowship and a Helen Merrill Playwriting Award.</p>
        <p>Tracing the genesis of the play, he said he began with two ideas: ''One was to write about two sisters who are quarreling over the legacy of something left behind by their father. The other was about someone who knew that her parent had had problems of mental illness,'' and when she reached the age of the onset of his madness, was beginning to worry that ''she might be going through the same thing.''</p>
        <p>There were many possibilities for that legacy, or, as he said, ''any number of Maguffins.'' He decided to use mathematics, and, for plot, the question of the authorship of a brilliant mathematical proof. Explaining that choice, he said: ''The great thing about math is that it's a kind of scientific activity that's still done in a solitary way. Most science is now with big teams on big projects. In math, someone could have done something major working alone in an attic.''</p>
        <p>Although the play is filled with mathematical references and amusing asides about scholarship and rivalry in the field, it is not, he said, a play about math. More important, it deals with the family under stress, especially with the daughter ''and her desire to follow in her father's footsteps and also her fear of doing that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Auburn is not a math scholar, but he studied calculus at the University of Chicago and has a great interest in popular science. ''I knew a lot of science and math guys in school,'' he said. ''You'd go to the gym and you'd hear them talking pure math talk, locker room talk, University of Chicago style.''</p>
        <p>For research, he read many books, beginning with ''A Mathematician's Apology'' by G. H. Hardy: ''It's a classic work about doing math and science and their aesthetic appeal. It communicates the passion and excitement'' -- as does the play.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Auburn began the play, Sylvia Nasar's book ''A Beautiful Mind'' had not been published, but he was aware of the subject, John Forbes Nash Jr., a Nobel Prize-winning mathematician who had paranoid schizophrenia. In some ways, Nash could have been a model for the father in the play (played by Larry Bryggman). Along the way the playwright talked to mathematicians, partly to decide on his use of language. He was told that some of it was so arcane that even those in the field did not always understand it.</p>
        <p>One major decision was how much technical information to include. In contrast to Michael Frayn's ''Copenhagen,'' he chose ''to err on the side of less information.'' It is not until the closing minutes that theatergoers have more than an inkling of the nature of the proof. The title came early, and intentionally has metaphorical intimations.</p>
        <p>The academic context of the play comes from the playwright's own experience. He was born in Chicago and grew up in Arkansas, where his father was an English professor (he is now a college dean). He is an expert on Richard Brinsley Sheridan, and the first play his son saw was ''The School for Scandal,'' eventually many times in many productions.</p>
        <p>His days at the University of Chicago were transforming. He joined a theater troupe called Off Off Campus and acted and wrote comedy sketches, very much in the Chicago tradition of Second City. Writing sketches, he said, ''you develop a rough toolbox of techniques,'' and with that as a base he moved to one-acts.</p>
        <p>As a critic on his university newspaper, he immersed himself in Chicago theater, seeing a diversity of plays at Steppenwolf, Goodman and other theaters. He especially liked Steppenwolf, where he was excited by ''that immediate roughhouse style.'' Although Mr. Auburn has great admiration for David Mamet, Tom Stoppard would seem to be more of an influence, for his ''playfulness and the rigor of his construction.''</p>
        <p>Following up an interest in political science, he had an offer to work for Senator Paul Simon during the summer of his sophomore year but turned it down to join his theater company at the Edinburgh Festival. After a Stephen Spielberg fellowship writing screenplays in Los Angeles, he came to New York to continue his writing.</p>
        <p>Accepted into the Juilliard School's playwriting program, he was in the first class taught by Marsha Norman and Christopher Durang. His classmates included Stephen Belber, Kira Obolensky and Julia Jordan, all promising playwrights. He wrote plays as well as monologues, several of which were later published in Middlebury College's New England Review. One of the plays was ''Skyscraper,'' a free-flowing comedy about urban architecture and couples uncoupling in Chicago. It had a brief run Off Broadway in 1997 and was, he said, a learning experience.</p>
        <p>After Juilliard he worked in book publishing and for a documentary film company, quitting to join his wife-to-be in London, where she was doing research for her Ph.D. Living abroad, he began writing ''Proof,'' approaching the play in a more realistic, less absurd style than his previous work.</p>
        <p>For background, he reflected on his university days in Chicago, remembering the eccentric people in the Hyde Park section around the university(the setting of the play). He recalled one professor who taught chemistry all day and ''then would spend his free time marching around his neighborhood with a broomstick chanting the song from 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' at the top of his voice.''</p>
        <p>''I think there is some connection between extremely prodigious mathematical ability and craziness,'' he said. ''I don't think that math drives people crazy, but those with edgy or slightly irrational personalities are drawn to it.''</p>
        <p>Asked if the character played by Ms. Parker was based on anyone, perhaps his wife, he said, ''No,'' and added emphatically, ''My wife is a very intelligent and beautiful woman. You can put that in: intelligent and beautiful.''</p>
        <p>Again he emphasized that the family was at the center of his play, ''I think everyone thinks about their relationship to their parents, what they're getting from that relationship, what they're not getting, what they will give back to them.''</p>
        <p>Before the play opened, he was upset by a line in a magazine suggesting that it was about ''your fear of being like your parents.'' After that appeared in print, he telephoned his parents in Ohio to make sure they knew the fear was that of the character and not the fear of their son. Several weeks ago, the Auburns saw ''Proof'' at a preview. ''Mom says thumbs up and Dad does too,'' he said. ''I hope they'll be quoted in the ads.''</p>
        <p>Along with his gift for dialogue and characterization, he has a strong sense of narrative. ''Proof'' has a series of dramatic surprises, including a first-act curtain that audiences greet with an audible sigh.</p>
        <p>Recently he watched the screenwriter Richard LaGravenese on television saying he was thinking of writing a play because then he would not have to worry about plot and ''could just have people talking.''</p>
        <p>''Just people talking!'' said Mr. Auburn in disbelief. ''I practically threw my shoe at the television.''</p>
