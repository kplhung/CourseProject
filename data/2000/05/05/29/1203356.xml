        <p>In this densely packed city, where property is the coin of the realm, Raymond Kwok is as close as one gets to royalty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kwok's 46th-floor office looks out on a forest of skyscrapers, dozens of them built by his family. Across the harbor in Kowloon are sawtooth rows of apartment houses, also built by the family. The Kwok's real estate empire is one of the largest in Asia, making Raymond, 46, and his two brothers fabulously wealthy, even by Hong Kong's baroque standards.</p>
        <p>These days, however, Mr. Kwok is worried about something that has little to do with concrete, glass and steel. ''We always follow closely what is happening in the U.S.,'' he said. ''In America, we see how technology is changing business, how technology is creating a lot of new businesses.''</p>
        <p>As the Internet sweeps across the Pacific, Mr. Kwok believes technology will unleash the same frenzy of sudden wealth and disorienting change in Asia. If his family wants to keep its place among Hong Kong's commercial elite, he says, it must join the revolution. So Mr. Kwok, a Harvard M.B.A., has devised one of the most ambitious Internet strategies of any old-line Asian company, creating a diverse portfolio of Internet start-ups related to his family's business.</p>
        <p>The Kwoks are one of several wealthy Asian clans determined not to be left behind. From Taiwan to Thailand, the region's most powerful families have started a blizzard of online ventures. Whether their core businesses are in property, telecommunications or banking, Asia's tycoons are seizing on the Internet in hopes of expanding their reach.</p>
        <p>In the process, the Internet is transforming the way business is done here and elsewhere in East Asia. With its emphasis on speed, openness, and collaboration, the Net is challenging traditional Asian values of prudence and family control. Decisions, which used to be made by the patriarch behind a veil of secrecy, are being pushed down the ranks as Asian companies embrace Silicon Valley-style management.</p>
        <p>''The classic Asian family dynasty probably isn't the best suited to succeed on the Internet,'' said Peter Yip, the chief executive of Chinadotcom, one of Asia's first publicly traded Internet companies. ''But I've been amazed by how quickly they've learned the business.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone is so sanguine. Despite their chameleon-like adaptability, Asia's tycoons may have trouble making the leap into cyberspace, critics say. For the last quarter-century, the tycoons rode a wave of double-digit growth. In countries like Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, cozy ties with governments sheltered them from market forces.</p>
        <p>''These guys think the Internet will bring them prosperity for the next 25 years,'' said Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong publisher who is putting his media properties online and starting an Internet shop-from-home service. ''But to unlearn the lessons of the last 25 years is impossible.''</p>
        <p>Over time, Mr. Lai (pronounced lie) predicts, the culture of the Internet will erode the dominance of family dynasties in Asian commerce. By making information widely available, the Web will gradually devalue the networks of personal contacts -- known in Chinese as guanxi -- amassed over decades.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kwok, though, thinks he can ride the technology tidal wave. He spent much of 1999 in the United States, roaming around conferences and quizzing entrepreneurs.</p>
        <p>He discovered some online businesses that play to the strengths of property owners. One is providing specially outfitted office space to house computer servers. Another is creating Internet sites, including chat rooms and bulletin boards, for the residents of the apartment complexes owned by the Kwok family's company, Sun Hung Kai Properties.</p>
        <p>Soon, Mr. Kwok packaged his collection of start-ups into a holding company, Sunevision, which went public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. While Mr. Kwok is the chairman, he has recruited an outside executive to run it.</p>
        <p>''The mind-set of a technology company is very different from a property company,'' Mr. Kwok said. ''We needed to remove a lot of baggage.''</p>
        <p>For Jeffrey Koo Jr., the challenge was persuading his elders that the Internet was more than a fad. Mr. Koo, 35, is a fourth-generation member of a family that controls a vast empire in banking, telecommunications, cement and cable television.</p>
        <p>In talking with classmates from the Wharton School in 1997, Mr. Koo became convinced that his family had to lash its future to the Internet. As president of the family's Chinatrust Commercial Bank, Mr. Koo began taking baby steps online. But his father turned down his first request for $10 million to finance an Internet service provider.</p>
        <p>''My father and his brothers were against me doing this because they thought of it as a form of gambling,'' Mr. Koo said. ''When I would talk excitedly about a new venture, they would look at me blankly.''</p>
        <p>In Mr. Koo's case, the elders came around when Microsoft bought a 10 percent stake in his start-up, GigaMedia, an entertainment and information service. Earlier this year, GigaMedia became the first Taiwan Internet company to go public on the Nasdaq exchange. Although it was caught in Nasdaq's downdraft, it is still worth well over $2 billion.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Koo is developing online banking and a regional e-commerce service to complement the family's 75 percent stake in GigaMedia. Less than two years after his father gave the Internet the cold shoulder, Jeffrey Jr. said, he now talks constantly about the cyberworld.</p>
        <p>To some students of Asian business, this is merely a new chapter in an old story. Ethnic Chinese families have traditionally prospered by adapting to new circumstances. Kwok Tak-seng, the patriarch of the Kwok family, started as a trader in southern China. By the 1950's, he had migrated to Hong Kong and become the local agent for the Y.K.K. zipper company of Japan.</p>
        <p>Sensing more opportunity in property than zippers, Mr. Kwok began building apartment houses. By the 1980's, he was a leading real estate developer. Mr. Kwok died in 1990, but under his three sons, Sun Hung Kai grew into a conglomerate with interests in toll roads, cargo handling and mobile telephones.</p>
        <p>''One good thing about old-economy companies is that they have profits and cash flow,'' said Raymond's older brother, Thomas, who oversees Sun Hung Kai's real estate business. ''But old-economy companies need new-economy ideas to survive.''</p>
        <p>For all their rock-solid stature, however, Asia's tycoons face challenges from a host of upstarts. Mr. Lai, the publisher and a self-styled maverick, offers himself as an example. Last year, he started a venture that lets customers order groceries and other goods by phone or over the Internet. The company, adMart, delivers from its warehouses, cutting out the middleman.</p>
        <p>In Hong Kong, the middleman for many of these goods is Li Ka-shing, a billionaire who owns one of the two local supermarket chains. When Mr. Lai's delivery business began to pinch Mr. Li's stores, he canceled his company's advertising in Apple Daily and Next magazine, the outspoken newspaper and weekly magazine at the heart of Mr. Lai's company.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Lai, the lost revenue has hurt. But after years of tweaking Hong Kong's establishment in his newspaper, Mr. Lai relishes mounting a frontal assault on its most powerful local businessman. ''I could never take on Li Ka-shing before,'' Mr. Lai said. ''But if I'm riding on the back of a huge market force like the Internet, then even he can't stop me.''</p>
        <p>In a sense, the Internet is the second revolution to rumble through Asia recently. In 1997 and 1998, the regional financial crisis brought many family empires to the brink of ruin. Even in Hong Kong, property prices plunged by more than half, and are only now recovering.</p>
        <p>In the aftermath, many Asian governments took steps to clean up their banks, tighten commercial regulations and force companies to improve their disclosure.</p>
        <p>''Before the crisis, Asian firms regarded financial disclosure and minority shareholders as a necessary irritant,'' said Peter Churchouse, co-head of research at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Hong Kong. ''Now they know they can't get away with that.''</p>
        <p>But if Asia's tycoons were humbled, the crisis did not dull their entrepreneurial instincts. Watching start-ups like Amazon.com become  sensations in America, the tycoons saw a chance for a quick score. Virtually every conglomerate rushed out an Internet unit.</p>
        <p>Li Ka-shing started e-commerce ventures through his two companies, Hutchison Whampoa and Cheung Kong Holdings. He also backed a Chinese-language portal, Tom.com, which prompted a near-riot among investors when it went public last February. Tom.com tumbled in the global technology sell-off. But thanks to Mr. Li's gold-plated reputation, it still trades above its offering price.</p>
        <p>''You've got to hand it to the conglomerates, they've maintained their position in a radically different economy,'' said Mark Duff, the founder and chief executive of Boom.com, an online stock-trading company here.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Duff and other entrepreneurs fear that the tycoons are colonizing Asia's cyberspace. They say that the family companies can soak up money and talent that could have gone to more daring ideas.</p>
        <p>It is true that the tycoon-backed ventures are often unimaginative. Sunevision's concept of providing warehouses for Web servers was pioneered in the United States by Exodus. Tom.com promoted itself as a mega-portal for Chinese audiences around the world. When it went public, its Web site consisted of a home page and links that went nowhere.</p>
        <p>''Some of the initiatives in Asia are extremely shallow,'' Mr. Duff said. ''But the brand names of the families are so strong that it doesn't matter. They get funded.''</p>
        <p>A few executives are trying to force deeper changes in Asian culture. Richard Li, the son of Li Ka-shing, is building an office park here. The 64-acre complex, known as Cyberport, is supposed to offer tenants a campus-like environment where ideas can be swapped and new businesses hatched.</p>
        <p>Just 33 years old, Mr. Li is the brashest Internet entrepreneur in Hong Kong and a symbol of Asia's headlong flight into cyberspace. His two-year-old company, Pacific Century Cyberworks, recently won a $36 billion takeover battle for Hong Kong's main telephone company. Mr. Li is also building a satellite-delivered Internet service.</p>
        <p>Mr. Li epitomizes the contradiction in Asia's version of the Internet. A scion of the Li dynasty, he has created a cyberage company crackling with the energy of employees hoping to strike it rich on stock options. The company's latest conquest has been likened to America Online's acquisition of Time Warner.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Li would never have triumphed without a $12 billion syndicated loan arranged by the Bank of China to finance the deal. And analysts agree that Mr. Li would never have landed such a loan without his father's connections.</p>
        <p>Likewise with the Cyberport. It may plant the seed for a fertile technology culture in Hong Kong. Yet rivals of the Li family have criticized the project because it was awarded to Pacific Century by the Hong Kong government in a back-room deal.</p>
        <p>These days, the tycoons stop short of extolling Asian values, but they make no apologies for their privileges. ''There's a blend of Western and Asian elements here,'' said Alex Arena, Mr. Li's top lieutenant. ''It's not a question of being like the U.S. It's a question of cherry-picking from the U.S.''</p>
