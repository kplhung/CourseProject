        <p>Is the United States prepared to discard an arms control system that has been a policy goal of every president since Dwight D. Eisenhower?

        <p>William Safire (column, May 25) doesn't mention a number of important issues in the debate about a national missile defense system.</p>
        <p>Is the United States prepared to discard an arms control system that has been a policy goal of every president since Dwight D. Eisenhower? Is it prepared to ignore the concerns of key allies like Germany, France and Japan? Is it prepared to undermine the deterrence capacity of other nuclear countries, including Russia, China, India and Pakistan?</p>
        <p>On the one hand, we have a proven system that situates the assurance of retaliatory destruction within a framework of treaties. On the other hand, we have an unproven system that could provoke a new arms race.</p>
        <p>Whether the threat of ''rogue states'' is serious enough to require a missile defense system is an assessment that should not be made during the heat of an election campaign.</p>
