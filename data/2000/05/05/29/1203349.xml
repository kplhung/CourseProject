        <p>What a difference a candidate makes.</p>
        <p>In state budget talks in April, the Legislature was prepared to have New York join a new program to let thousands of disabled people stay on Medicaid, the federal health insurance plan for the poor, even after getting jobs. But Gov. George E. Pataki's office balked at the cost, and the plan was dropped, apparently dead for the year.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, it is very much alive again, and state officials and lobbyists say it stands a good chance of approval. Why? Because its primary author is Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republicans' new candidate for the United States Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mr. Lazio was chief sponsor of the bill that created the program and set aside $250 million to help the states pay for it.</p>
        <p>Republican legislators confess to daydreaming about a bill-signing at which they would join Mr. Lazio, the Republican governor and a few dozen people in wheelchairs -- a politically valuable photo opportunity for the evening news. That notion, they say, has been enough to sway the governor, a prime sponsor of Mr. Lazio's candidacy, into reconsidering the issue.</p>
        <p>Officials in the governor's office confirmed that the program was once again under consideration but would not say why.</p>
        <p>''Besides the merits -- and we supported it all along -- this thing is golden politically,'' a Republican state senator said.</p>
        <p>Many of the Republicans who hold a majority in the State Senate are seen as vulnerable this year, and they see the United States Senate race as being crucial to their chances in November. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, is not expected to carry New York, so Republican lawmakers want a strong Senate candidate near the top of the ticket.</p>
        <p>For more than a year, that candidate was Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, but he dropped out of the race after learning that he had prostate cancer. Mr. Lazio, who is from Suffolk County, will be formally nominated for the Senate at his party's state convention in Buffalo on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>While the Republicans in the State Senate assert that Mr. Lazio is just as strong a standard-bearer as Mr. Giuliani, they fear that his low name recognition and late start in the race could harm him -- and them -- and they have been eager to bolster his standing with voters.</p>
        <p>The Medicaid effort for the disabled is a perfect fit, the kind of social program more commonly identified with Democrats. And it contrasts with the image that Mrs. Clinton is trying to impose on Mr. Lazio -- that of a far-right, ideological conservative.</p>
        <p>Her campaign has noted that she, too, favored the Medicaid program for the disabled, emphasizing the fact that her husband, the president, signed it into law.</p>
        <p>Michael Kink, a lobbyist for Housing Works, an advocate for people with AIDS, said, ''It's pretty clear that Lazio's entry into the race reignited interest in this.''</p>
        <p>In conference committees last month, the Assembly, controlled by Democrats,  and the Senate agreed to have New York join the new Medicaid program. But the governor's budget office said it would cost the state $24 million a year, twice as much as estimated by both houses of the Legislature and by advocates for the disabled.</p>
        <p>In budget talks, the governor's office insisted that if the program were to be included in the budget, the Legislature would have to give up $24 million worth of its pet projects, to keep within the overall spending caps the lawmakers had agreed to. Faced with that, the Legislature dropped the idea, and the $77.5 billion budget was approved without it in early May.</p>
        <p>But in the last week, as Mr. Lazio emerged as his party's uncontested Senate candidate, several Republican state senators -- including two influential Long Island representatives, Kemp Hannon, the Health Committee chairman, and Dean G. Skelos, the deputy majority leader -- pushed to resurrect the idea. Officials say both houses of the Legislature are still willing to approve it, though that would break the spending cap. The question remains whether Mr. Pataki will go along.</p>
        <p>Normally, people lose Medicaid benefits if they get full-time jobs. Advocates for the poor have urged softening this, so that the poor do not have to choose between employment and health care, which they say impedes efforts to move people off welfare.</p>
        <p>The new program allows people with disabilities to keep Medicaid coverage after finding work, if they do not earn more than $45,000 a year. But each state must decide whether to opt into the program and share in its cost. A disabled person earning more than about $17,000 a year would have to pay a monthly premium to stay in Medicaid. The premium would vary depending on the income, ranging from $25 to $333.</p>
