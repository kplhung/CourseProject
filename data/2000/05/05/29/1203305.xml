        <p>Internet users are accustomed to, and typically embrace, rapid-fire change. But some types of change can make Internet users downright grumpy, as the online magazine Salon recently learned.</p>
        <p>Salon introduced a redesigned site (www.salon.com) last Monday. It did not take long before critiques started pouring in by e-mail from hundreds of readers: the site had technical bugs; it was too cluttered; its new, smaller type font was too hard to read.</p>
        <p>Salon's editor, David Talbot, responded on Wednesday with a ''We feel your pain'' letter to the site's readers. The note said Salon was tinkering with the site to fix the bugs and to address concerns about the font size.</p>
        <p>But Salon's readers are not the only audience that matters. Mr. Talbot said in an interview that one reason for the redesign was to give more prominent placement to advertisers.</p>
        <p>''Advertisers pay the freight here,'' he said, adding that readers need to understand that the advertising revenue makes it unnecessary to charge subscription fees for the site. ''We have to make more room for sponsorship.''</p>
        <p>A second business reality, Mr. Talbot said, is that the new design will make it easier to find room for continuous breaking news. He said Salon was moving away from a magazine format and into that of a ''continuously published newspaper,'' including the use of news agency reports.</p>
        <p>That vision may initially meet resistance from some of Salon's three million monthly visitors, Mr. Talbot acknowledged. But he said that in the long run, Web publications that survive must take advantage of the speed and immediacy of the Internet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Talbot said he was not overly concerned about last week's reader complaints, noting that readers also protested last year when the site had a less ambitious revamping.</p>
        <p>Readers are now arguing to keep some of the same features they vehemently objected to when they were added last year. ''I'm actually flattered by how passionately and seriously people regard Salon,'' he said.</p>
