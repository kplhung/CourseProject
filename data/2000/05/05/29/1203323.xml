        <p>Cut from its moorings at the 92nd Street Y, the New York Chamber Symphony has been working the past few years toward a new identity and a permanent sense of home. Much of what was good remains. The core of principal players survives, as does Gerard Schwarz, the music director. Mr. Schwarz is still a thoughtful and adventurous conductor, and the tendency to micromanage -- to fiddle with details seemingly for the sake of fiddling -- seems to have subsided.</p>
        <p>Wednesday's playing of Haydn's Symphony No. 97 substantiated all this: straightforward, buoyant, with Haydn's martial timpani parts and splendid surprises coherently managed. Playing in Alice Tully Hall has helped this group, freeing it from the dry and claustrophobic acoustics of the Y. Cellos and basses now have room to resonate. The rawness of the upper string sound may have had to do with Haydn's tone colors as transferred to modern instruments, but one knew one was hearing good players well rehearsed.</p>

        <p>Cut from its moorings at the 92nd Street Y, the New York Chamber Symphony has been working the past few years toward a new identity and a permanent sense of home.

        <p>Wednesday's playing of Haydn's Symphony No. 97 substantiated all this: straightforward, buoyant, with Haydn's martial timpani parts and splendid surprises coherently managed. Playing in Alice Tully Hall has helped this group, freeing it from the dry and claustrophobic acoustics of the Y. Cellos and basses now have room to resonate. The rawness of the upper string sound may have had to do with Haydn's tone colors as transferred to modern instruments, but one knew one was hearing good players well rehearsed.</p>
        <p>Dvorak's brief Notturno in B for strings added a novel touch. Its beauties are dark and slow-moving and decorated with the curlicued ornamental turns so favored by Wagner. At the end was Brahms's Double Concerto. Hearing big Brahms for reduced strings had its purposes, reminding us of a composer more interested in clear if acerbic part writing than in the grand, smothering effect. Lynn Harrell played the cello with both warmth and precision. The violinist Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, her tendencies toward overexcitability curtailed by the format, was a passionate and generally effective partner.</p>
        <p>One could hardly find an unkind word for the evening's new piece, Philip Lasser's ''Circle of Dreams.'' Dulcet and pastoral, filled with ingratiating harmonies and modal gestures, Mr. Lasser's three movements float between early-20th-century France and a Vaughan Williams country scene. ''Circle of Dreams'' wouldn't hurt a fly.</p>
        <p>It did make you think. Clearly, new music's insistence on groundbreaking -- its contempt for grammars that are not original and different -- is wrong. Haydn spoke in received languages, so why not Mr. Lasser? ''Circle of Dreams'' is well made. The uneven phrase lengths engage the ear, and the composer's ability to manage long lyrical lines with grace is considerable. Why, then, does this music sound so pointless? Perhaps because it occupies an older era while bringing nothing fresh from it. The texture sounds not so much antique as antiqued, like a shiny Grand Rapids copy of 18th-century furniture that in the end is neither new nor old.</p>
        <p>Tully Hall was virtually full on Wednesday. Too big for string quartets, too small for symphony orchestras, this is a space that suits an ensemble of 40 to 50 well. There will be six subscription programs there next season, and expansion is on the minds of its directors.</p>
