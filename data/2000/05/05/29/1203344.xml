        <p>More than 200,000 people, a crowd larger than any expected at the Olympics here in September, marched today to support campaigns for social justice for Australia's black minority.</p>
        <p>The largest civil rights gathering in Australian history clogged Sydney, a sprawling city of eight million people, and forced the police to close much of the city to traffic for up to eight hours.</p>
        <p>High above the river of people who delivered the country's sharpest political street message since anti-Vietnam war demonstrations in the 1970's, a sky-writer left a white vapor trail in the blue sky, tracing the simple message: ''Sorry.''</p>
        <p>Police officials estimated the crowd at more than 150,000. Rally leaders claimed that the total was much higher, and a national TV network gave an estimate of 250,000.</p>
        <p>Geoff Clark, chairman of Australia's leading indigenous lobby group, the Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander Commission, called the strong showing ''a huge success,'' while other march organizers were swift to take the size of the gathering as a mandate to press the government for a formal treaty on the status and rights of Australia's 380,000 Aborigines.</p>
        <p>Evelyn Scott, chairwoman of the multiracial Reconciliation Council that organized the march, noted that such agreements have been negotiated for minorities in Canada, Scandinavia and New Zealand.</p>
        <p>The Sydney parade -- a three-mile walk through downtown with the air of a family outing in brisk fall weather -- was the centerpiece of a weekend of nationwide ceremonies and rallies organized by the council to acknowledge mistreatment of Aborigines and to press for future equity for them.</p>
        <p>From early morning to midafternoon, a river of people flowed across the eight-lane, mile-long Harbor Bridge on which the Australian national flag and the black, red and yellow Aboriginal political flag were flying. Organizers chose the route to symbolize hopes for bridging two centuries of estrangement between the white majority and Aborigines in this country of 19 million.</p>
        <p>European settlement began in Australia in 1788 with a British convict colony on Sydney Harbor. Aboriginal history here goes back to 600 tribal groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers who roamed this vast island continent for 40,000 years.</p>
        <p>Today's marchers were overwhelmingly white, but included Asians, Australia's latest immigrants. Both black and white civil rights leaders concede that recent surveys have revealed that deep national divisions still exist about what to say and do about Aboriginal grievances and aspirations.</p>
        <p>Australia's Prime Minister John Howard, a conservative elected in 1996, has rejected the demands of Aborigines for a formal government apology for past mistreatment as well as calls for a civil rights treaty.</p>
        <p>Today's march started from an intersection near his official waterfront residence, but Mr. Howard did not join the gathering.</p>
        <p>The Reconciliation Council acknowledges that its own extensive research shows majority support for Mr. Howard's position. The surveys show 58 percent oppose special rights for Aborigines to reflect their historic position. Some 62 percent reject an apology now for previous wrongs, some fearing retrospective compensation claims.</p>
        <p>Mr. Howard, 61, a political professional known as a close student of such polls, says he favors what he terms ''practical reconciliation.'' On Saturday, he declared again that this is more likely to be achieved by popular action than by official words and legislation.</p>
        <p>Some of his critics turned their backs on Mr. Howard and yelled ''Say sorry!'' as he spoke at a reconciliation ceremony on Saturday to a mostly white audience of about 1,500 at the Sydney Opera House, which is located on Bennelong Point, named for the chieftain who greeted the British invaders there.</p>
        <p>Since then, the first Australians have become the worst-off Australians.</p>
        <p>In this generally affluent nation, they have levels of health, education, income, employment, housing, and life expectancy far lower than those of whites and Asians, and the highest rates of imprisonment and welfare dependency. Until recently, their plight has attracted more indifference than understanding.</p>
        <p>Aborigines have had full civil rights since the 1960's and in the 1990's made political gains. For most, those advances have not lifted living standards much, despite welfare and other government funding of $1.5 billion this year.</p>
        <p>The rising generation of Aboriginal leaders, like Senator Aden Ridgway, 38, the only indigenous member of the federal Parliament, and Mr. Clark, 47, both of mixed parentage, say the problems and answers are more matters of self-esteem and self-determination than of more money.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 31, 2000, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about a demonstration in Sydney in support of social justice for Australia's black minority misstated the city's population. It is four million, not eight million.</p>
