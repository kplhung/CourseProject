        <p>With the historic drop in violent crime beginning to take hold in even the most blighted urban areas, cities across the country are being transformed, as neighborhoods that had become frightening wastelands are showing glimmers of renaissance.</p>
        <p>From Boston to New Orleans and Los Angeles to Miami, neighborhoods where drug gangs controlled the streets, commandeered empty houses and terrorized residents are beginning to seem safer and more livable, according to interviews with people in nine cities that have seen sharp drops in violent crime.</p>
        <p>New homes are being built, stores are opening, subway and bus lines are adding service, and banks and shopping strips are breaking ground. There is less graffiti and fewer abandoned cars and vacant lots. And, for the first time in years, people are sitting on their front porches and parents feel safe letting their children walk to school.</p>
        <p>In the U Street neighborhood of Washington, the subway system is operating later at night, and an organic grocery store and a private jazz club with a $2,500 annual membership fee are to open soon. In the Oakwood section of Los Angeles, forbidding eight-foot fences are being replaced with lower picket fences and other inviting designs. And in the Overtown and Liberty City neighborhoods of Miami, textile plants, production studios and a food processing plant are opening.</p>
        <p>Especially striking is that people are beginning to move to these neighborhoods from more stable urban areas and the suburbs, the interviews suggest.</p>
        <p>''There is a sense that cities are safer,'' said Robert Sampson, a professor of sociology at the University of Chicago. ''And there is a return to the city among not just empty nesters, but people with kids.''</p>
        <p>Most of these neighborhoods are still struggling with crime and poverty. But the improvements have taken on such momentum that they do not appear to be slowed by increases in some violent crimes in several cities last year, including Boston, Houston, New York, San Antonio and San Diego.</p>
        <p>In Chicago, surveys conducted by a Northwestern University political scientist, Wesley G. Skogan, have found that in the sections of the city where crime has declined sharply, primarily African-American neighborhoods on the South and West Sides, there have been ''extremely large increases in the quality of life,'' Professor Skogan said.</p>
        <p>He said residents in those neighborhoods had reported a lessening of drug and gang activity, declines in public drinking, loitering and disorder in the schools and streets that were cleaner and had fewer abandoned buildings and cars.</p>
        <p>Changes like that were clear last week in one neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago. In a city where neighborhoods are a source of strong local pride, this section about five miles west of the Loop did not even have a name until recently and had virtually fallen off the map, longtime residents say. Now they say the area has revived enough to be considered part of the Tri-Taylor neighborhood, which is near the University of Illinois.</p>
        <p>''We were considered nowhere really,'' said Nancy Echevarria, 46, who has lived on Taylor Street almost all her life. ''The neighborhood was taboo. It was like the O.K. Corral here. Gangs of 30 guys would position themselves right on the street selling drugs.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Echevarria and her husband, Fidel, who are raising two children, ages 7 and 9, and a granddaughter, age 3, used to call the police frequently, and in retaliation, she said, gang members put a bullet through her front door a couple of years ago.</p>
        <p>But in the last few years, the rampant crime in the police district that includes the neighborhood dropped more than in any other section of Chicago, 36 percent from 1992 to 1998, police figures show. Ms. Echevarria said she sees far fewer drug dealers and there is only one vacant house left on her block. On Taylor Street, $350,000 condominiums are being built, and the value of three houses owned by Ms. Echevarria has skyrocketed, to more than $150,000 each from about $15,000 some 10 years ago.</p>
        <p>Her children skate and bicycle on the streets, which have new sidewalks. ''The other day,'' she said, ''it was so nice to come out in the morning and just sit and hear the birds.''</p>
        <p>Experts say such progress results from a number of social and economic factors that have helped bring the decrease in crime and are benefiting from it. The booming economy has created so much urban development that builders and businesses are venturing farther away from well-established neighborhoods into ones that were on the edge of livability.</p>
        <p>Cities are using budget surpluses to offer tax incentives to businesses that open in these areas. And in some places, like Chicago, other major changes are under way in these communities, including changes in schools and the dismantling of huge, crime-plagued housing projects, like Rockwell Gardens, not far from Ms. Echevarria's home.</p>
        <p>With less crime, there have been more jobs. In Miami, Frank R. Nero, the president of the Beacon Council, a private, nonprofit economic development agency, said factories and other businesses had been moving into neighborhoods like Overtown and Liberty City.</p>
        <p>''Investors are starting to feel more comfortable,'' Mr. Nero said. ''The more investment you have in an area, the safer it is and the safer it will become.''</p>
        <p>In addition, as things improve and as new policing strategies concentrate on community outreach, residents have become more willing to cooperate with the police, which has helped reduce crime.</p>
        <p>Henry Flack, who has lived in the Skyline Park neighborhood of San Antonio for 15 years, said he sees the police on patrol much more often and has developed more of a relationship with them.</p>
        <p>''I know them, and they know me,'' Mr. Flack said as he sat on his porch the other day. ''If they've got a problem, they let me know, and if I've got a problem, I know just who to call.''</p>
        <p>There was a shooting near his house several days ago, he said.  ''The police came by and told me that a kid had shot at another bunch of kids and I said, 'Oh, that would be so-and-so who lives in that green house over there,' '' he said. ''They had that deal wrapped up in a couple of hours.''</p>
        <p>In city after city, the changes are seeping into the fabric of neighborhood life.</p>
        <p>In the Uphams Corner section of Boston's Dorchester neighborhood, an area known for crimes like the 1992 slaying of a man who was eating dinner with his wife at the Tasty Chicken restaurant, drug houses have been shut down and businesses have opened, including a children's clothing shop and a housewares store. Youth programs have sprung up, a park that used to be littered with used condoms and drug needles is being renovated, and the community has begun sponsoring a street festival.</p>
        <p>''I see fewer bars on windows,'' said Jan Mattimoe, a middle-school teacher who helps organize a community improvement project. ''This spring I've seen more flowers in this area than I've ever seen. There is real desire to get out there and make things look pretty.''</p>
        <p>In Washington's U Street neighborhood, Cici Mukhtar, the owner of a cafe, said she was glad to have a fancy organic supermarket and an exclusive jazz club moving in. That is all part of what has made the neighborhood more attractive, she said.</p>
        <p>''It's amazing, just amazing what's happening here,'' Ms. Mukhtar said.</p>
        <p>Myra Power, 28, who lived in the neighborhood from 1991 until moving to New York in 1997, was back last week, looking for work and a place to live. She said she noticed a huge change.</p>
        <p>''When I lived here, I wouldn't leave home without my Mace,'' Ms. Power said.</p>
        <p>Now, children stay out late playing basketball and waiting in line to use the playground swings. Construction crews are busy renovating old buildings and building new ones.</p>
        <p>Ms. Powers said her friends now leave belongings out on their porches. ''It used to be that the only thing they'd leave out was barbed wire,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Instead of worrying about break-ins, she said, they fret over how to plant the most attractive garden.</p>
        <p>In New Orleans, the crack houses and blighted buildings that choked the city's Irish Channel neighborhood are beginning to give way to avant-garde galleries, clothing shops and even a designer jewelry shop on Lower Magazine Street.</p>
        <p>''There used to be a grocery next door that would sell one beer and one cigarette, and there was a pay phone there, so there was a lot of loitering,'' said Patty Spinale, who opened her lingerie shop, House of Lounge, on Lower Magazine Street two years ago. ''The neighborhood has really significantly cleaned up in the last two years, in terms of people investing in it. More tourists are comfortable with venturing into the neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>And in Houston, Capt. Mark L. Curran, commander of the Eastside Division for the Police Department, said he hears evidence of improvement in the complaints he fields at civic club meetings.</p>
        <p>''Back in the early 90's, it was rape and burglaries,'' Captain Curran said. ''Now it's, 'I want you to take care of my neighbor's barking dog.' ''</p>
        <p>But as their neighborhoods have become more attractive, some residents have found themselves pushed out, along with the criminals.</p>
        <p>The end of the gang warfare that had terrorized the Oakwood section of Los Angeles, just blocks from Venice Beach, meant safer streets in an area that had been the city's only black neighborhood near the ocean.</p>
        <p>It has also meant that some people who had lived there for more than 30 years lost their leases, as landlords sold property to affluent newcomers or raised rents.</p>
        <p>''Up and down the street you see whites walking these days,'' said Melvyn Hayward Sr., a neighborhood organizer and director of the Vera Davis Community Center. ''In 20 years, you would never see that. They wouldn't come down here.''</p>
        <p>The changes are still quite new in most of these neighborhoods, and some residents are skeptical that the improvements will endure.</p>
        <p>''There is still crime,'' said Cynthia Harris, a case worker for a health center, who lives in Uphams Corner in Boston. ''My son finds needles in the driveway where he plays. And if I had an opportunity to move, I would.''</p>
        <p>In the Taylor Street neighborhood of Chicago, one developer, Senan Nugent, hires gang members to watch his properties so that other gang members will not steal plumbing pipes and supplies.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Nugent and others say they would not be there if they were not convinced that it was a safe, promising place to invest.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dave Williams bought a new three-unit condominium on Taylor Street for $367,000 this year, and he is renting it and three other buildings to students at the University of Illinois and employees at Rush Presbyterian Hospital. The renters are people who would not have dared live here in the past, Dr. Williams said. Many of the students come from the suburbs and drive sport utility vehicles, but they have no trouble getting their parents to co-sign their leases.</p>
        <p>And although he put up high wrought-iron fences with electronic security systems at the condominium, he said that only 2 of his 12 tenants bothered to turn on their systems. ''We were actually quite skeptical and nervous when we first invested,'' said Dr. Williams, an emergency room physician who lives downtown. ''But things have gotten steadily better. It's really one of Chicago's new frontiers now.''</p>
