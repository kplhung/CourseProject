        <p>Increasingly, as the major classical record labels undergo seismic reorganizations, followers of new music are finding that independent boutique labels like C.R.I., New World Records and Bridge are becoming the only companies willing to record new works. At Sony Classical, for example, film scores, crossover projects and topical works dominate the contemporary music releases. New music was never a priority at BMG, and it is unlikely to fare well as the company reconsiders its classical music lines this spring.

        <p>Increasingly, as the major classical record labels undergo seismic reorganizations, followers of new music are finding that independent boutique labels like C.R.I., New World Records and Bridge are becoming the only companies willing to record new works.

If it leaves EMI a free hand, perhaps that label's recent flirtations with new music, by way of the young English composer Thomas Ades and others, may continue.</p>
        <p>But in the last decade it is C.R.I. especially that has been a vital home for both traditionalists and listeners with eclectic tastes, thanks to the efforts of Joseph R. Dalton, the label's 37-year-old executive director. During his decade at the venerable label, Mr. Dalton has restored C.R.I. to its original mission: partly to be an alternative to the big commercial labels, which have always kept new works at arm's length, and partly to document the major currents and obscure tributaries of the developing American style.</p>
        <p>For about three decades, starting in the mid-1950's, C.R.I. (which stands for Composers' Recordings Inc.) was the first place collectors turned for new works, but when Mr. Dalton arrived in 1990, it had gained a reputation as a dusty repository of austere academic music. By seeking out musicians that his predecessors had ignored -- including post-Minimalists, young composers and performers with pop music sensibilities, and Asian and Latin American composers whose music bears the accents of their own cultures -- Mr. Dalton has revitalized the label.</p>
        <p>Recently Mr. Dalton surprised much of the new-music world by abruptly announcing his resignation. He left C.R.I. on Friday and says he plans to take a few months off before deciding what to do next. C.R.I. has moved quickly to find a successor -- some 30 candidates are under consideration -- but its first choice has reportedly turned down the job. There is talk of bringing the label under the umbrella of the American Music Center, but the discussions are said to be preliminary.</p>
        <p>''I was surprised to hear that he was leaving,'' said Mr. Kernis, whose first recording was released on C.R.I. in 1992. ''I'm sorry for us, sorry for the business of new music. He's given a lot of composers and performers wonderful opportunities. It's hard to imagine the label finding someone who will have the same kind of openness and flexibility and who is interested in so many styles and in exploring so many ways of seeing new music.''</p>
        <p>Given the extent to which C.R.I. has been revived under Mr. Dalton's leadership, the question of whether he was pushed is barely worth asking. People close to him say the frustrations of working for a nonprofit arts organization -- principally, working long hours at comparatively low wages with a skeleton support staff -- caught up with him. (Nonprofit tax status allows an organization to seek subsidies and grants. Most performing arts groups are nonprofit because the income from ticket sales does not cover costs. C.R.I, New World Records and several other small, specialist labels have nonprofit status.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Dalton, after a brief demurral, agreed with this analysis.</p>
        <p>''I'm surprised at the range of emotions I'm having,'' he told a visitor to the company's offices on Spring Street in SoHo during his final days at the label. ''People say, 'How can you leave C.R.I.? You are C.R.I.' Well, to be C.R.I. for 10 years is a lot. It's hard. It needed that -- someone to be a man about town, identified with the label as I have been, to help it break out of its sleepy, dusty academic image. But it wears on you.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the greatest frustration is one that is increasingly common in the nonprofit world: the sense that while the artists reap the benefits that nonprofit organizations bring them, those who keep the machinery running get few rewards.</p>
        <p>''There really needs to be something prior to a lifetime achievement award for the people who serve the arts as faithfully as the artists,'' Mr. Dalton said. ''It's almost a vocation, getting into this work, but there is very little nourishment. I got pats on the head from my board. But I didn't sign on to be a starving artist. I have an M.B.A. Caring for administrators, not just training them, is something I don't think is addressed enough, and it's crucial for the arts.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Dalton arrived at C.R.I. in 1990, the label had a distinguished history and a catalog of about 400 discs. It was started in 1954 by the composers Otto Luening and Douglas Moore, and Oliver Daniel, an arts executive, who included in the company's charter the guarantee that C.R.I.'s recordings would not go out of print so long as the company existed. Its early projects included works by experimenters like Henry Cowell, Lou Harrison, Harry Partch and John Cage as well as a full complement of Serialists, neo-Romantics and composers of other mainstream and academic persuasions. But by 1990, much of the adventure had left the label, and it had come to be regarded as crusty and out of touch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dalton, then 26, was exactly what the company needed. With a music degree from Catholic University in Washington and an M.B.A. from Southern Methodist University in Texas, he had worked for a season at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and for three years at Sony Classical.</p>
        <p>''At my first interview, I told them I came to New York because I was attracted to the works of Laurie Anderson, Philip Glass and Steve Reich, who were working here,'' Mr. Dalton said. ''And I saw their backs tighten, but when I met with some of the businessmen on the label's board, I said, 'These people are on major labels, and they sell.' It was clear to me pretty quickly why things weren't happening at C.R.I.''</p>
        <p>An early priority was to mend fences with composers who felt poorly treated by C.R.I. Another was to address C.R.I.'s reputation as a vanity label. Originally composers had to subsidize their recordings, usually with grants and awards, although it was never as if anyone with the cash could buy a place in the catalog: from the start, an adjudication committee screened submissions.</p>
        <p>''We have guidelines on how to submit work,'' Mr. Dalton said, ''and when I arrived, the guidelines said that if you don't have complete funding, don't send us your music. I stopped sending that out immediately; I thought it was appalling. My view was that an arts organization decides what it wants to do and then finds the money to do it. And that's how we operate now.''</p>
        <p>That said, C.R.I.'s projects are still subsidized by grants, sometimes arranged by the composers, but often arranged by C.R.I. once a recording has been approved by its editorial committee. The adjudication process, too, has changed during Mr. Dalton's tenure.</p>
        <p>''One of the things that Jody and I have tried to do is keep the committee rotating and anonymous,'' said the composer Chester Biscardi, referring to Mr. Dalton by his nickname. Mr. Biscardi is a member of the company's board and the chairman of its editorial committee. ''There are nine of us, and in terms of race, gender and style, it is very diverse in its representation so that we can get a balanced response. We get the tapes and scores, we listen to them, we have informal discussions and we come to a consensus about what's good for the label and whether it's possible financially.''</p>
        <p>Fairly quickly, Mr. Dalton was able to open C.R.I.'s gates to composers who had previously been excluded. Beginning with a handful of recordings inspired by the Bang on a Can Festival, he established the Emergency Music series as a home for downtown composers who bring together popular music influences, Minimalism and traditional techniques in their work. Another series, Exchange: Music at the Crossroads, has focused mostly on immigrant composers whose works embrace their cultural roots. He reissued the label's older recordings in an American Masters series that reminded collectors that the catalog was full of neglected gems and important scores. And a jazz series that he planned will have its first release this year.</p>
        <p>The yardstick for success at C.R.I. is modest. A collection of works by gay composers was a runaway hit with sales of 7,000, a minuscule figure by pop standards. The company's all-time best seller, a decades-old collection of works by Harry Partch, has sold about 25,000 copies.</p>
        <p>''Another thing one runs into at nonprofits,'' Mr. Dalton said, ''is that there is always a board member saying, 'Why are we nonprofit anyway?' And you get board members who think they are going to come in and give you 'business sense.' I let them argue that among themselves because, frankly, it's abusive to hear board members telling you that 'C.R.I. is a business and has to be run like a business' when you're spending 10 hours a day doing paperwork for grants. They don't get it. It's not that being called nonprofit makes us struggling and poor. It's that we're dedicated to something that will not survive commercially.''</p>
        <p>C.R.I. has, at any rate, upheld its pledge to keep its discs in print, no matter how slowly they sell. The company has a warehouse of LP's that collectors can still order through its Web site (www .composersrecordings.com) and if someone wants an LP that has not made the transition to CD and is out of stock, the company will make a cassette dub and photocopy the liner notes. In recent months, Mr. Dalton has been negotiating with Emusic, a company that will allow collectors to either download works from the Internet or order custom compilations of pieces from the C.R.I. catalogue. He expects that service to be available within a year.</p>
        <p>''What C.R.I. does is of the utmost importance,'' said Fran Richard, who runs the concert music department at Ascap, the performing rights organization. ''Every composer needs recordings. Without them, they're dead in the water, because not everyone attends concerts, and even for those who do, it takes time to get to know the piece. And to me, Jody was a real hero of this business. He was a discerning impresario, with courage and vision, and the choices he made were significant predictions of the important works of the end of the 20th century. He produced a legacy that has added immensely to the richness of the field, and he's going to be missed.''</p>
