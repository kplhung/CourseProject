        <p>A New York Post delivery truck collided with a police car headed to a report of gunfire early yesterday morning, killing the driver of the truck and a police officer, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The authorities described the accident as a horrendous crash.</p>
        <p>The 33,000-pound truck struck the passenger side of the police car at 3:37 a.m. at Bay Ridge Parkway and 18th Avenue in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. The truck driver, Jacques Lavache, 38, was thrown from the cab. He was pronounced dead at Lutheran Medical Center.</p>
        <p>The authorities said the truck barreled on after the collision, pushing the police cruiser over the curb and crushing it against the wall of the New Way Supermarket.</p>
        <p>Two police officers -- David Regan, 27, and Kenneth Waszak, 34 -- were trapped inside the car.</p>
        <p>An Emergency Service Unit removed them from the wreckage, but Officer Regan, who was in the front passenger seat, was pronounced dead at Maimonides Medical Center.</p>
        <p>Officer Waszak, the driver, suffered internal bleeding and a fractured spine. He was listed in serious condition at Lutheran Medical Center. Capt. June Martucci, a police spokeswoman, said he was expected to recover.</p>
        <p>''As of now, they said he is not going to be paralyzed,'' she said. ''But they said he is going to be hospitalized for a while.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who offered condolences to Officer Regan's parents at the hospital, said he reviewed pictures of the accident. ''It was one of the worst impacts I have ever seen,'' he said.</p>
        <p>No citations were issued after the crash.</p>
        <p>The authorities said Mr. Lavache, of the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn, had a valid driver's license and the truck appeared to have no mechanical defects or safety problems.</p>
        <p>The cruiser's flashing lights and siren were on before it entered the intersection, they said. It was not clear whether the truck had a green light as it drove through the intersection.</p>
        <p>The police said the matter was being investigated, as was the reason for the 911 call reporting gunfire. No evidence of gunfire was found, the police said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lavache was the father of a newborn, the police said. Formerly a longtime driver for The Daily News, he had recently been working part time for The Post.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lavache's phone number is unpublished, and efforts to reach his family were unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>Ken Chandler, the publisher of The New York Post, issued a statement.  ''This was a tragic accident,'' he said. ''Our sympathies go to the families and we hope the injured policeman recovers quickly.''</p>
        <p>Officers Regan and Waszak both joined the department in the fall of 1998. They were classmates at the Police Academy and were assigned to night tours on patrol in the 62nd Precinct.</p>
        <p>The authorities said Officer Regan, who lived in Garden City, N.Y.,  would have turned 28 on Thursday and planned to ask his girlfriend to marry him when she visited him from Texas next weekend.</p>
        <p>Officer Regan had recently told the department that he would leave his job this summer to move to Texas, and he had begun packing for the move, said Chief Christopher T. Austin of the Garden City Park Volunteer Fire Department, in which Officer Regan served as a lieutenant.</p>
        <p>Chief Austin, who is also a New York City police officer, said Officer Regan wore badge 102 -- the number that was on his grandfather's shield when he served in the same fire department years ago -- on both his police and fire uniforms.</p>
        <p>''He was always there for us with whatever we needed,'' the chief said. ''The guys are taking it rough.''</p>
