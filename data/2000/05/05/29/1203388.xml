        <p>Legend has it that the longest commencement address, said to have been given in the early days of Harvard University, lasted six hours -- the first three in Latin, the latter in Greek. The shortest, alternately attributed to Andy Rooney or Woody Allen, was just two sentences: ''We've given you a perfect world. Don't screw it up.''</p>
        <p>Every spring, they parade to the podiums of colleges and universities across the country, offering sage advice -- or at least a few one-liners. Poets and politicians. Athletes and artists. Diplomats and do-gooders.</p>
        <p>This year seemed an especially auspicious opportunity for keynoters, as the Class of 2000, the first of the new millennium, switched their tassels from side to side.</p>
        <p>They spoke of global responsibility -- to end poverty, fight disease, keep peace. They talked about technology, its gifts and its perils. They marveled at society's progress -- and questioned whether it has been swift enough in the field of human relations. They urged graduates to value time over money: ''You must place interest in principle above interest on principal,'' Julian Bond, the chairman of the N.A.A.C.P., said at Washington University in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>Many mentioned their own parents, and nearly all promised to keep their speeches shorter than the ones they could not remember from their own commencements. ''I intend to stop speaking before you stop listening,'' George J. Mitchell, the former senator from Maine, told his audience at Washington &amp; Jefferson College in Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>Following are excerpts.</p>
        <p>Seamus Heaney  Nobel laureate. University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>There is a dreamlike quality to every commencement day. But the veil trembles more mysteriously if you are graduating in the year 2000. It makes you wonder if the date is a destiny or an accident. A turning point in your life coincided with a turning point in our era. It is like the moment when a tide has risen to its highest and then rests: everything is at the full and yet everything is volatile.</p>
        <p>You stand at a boundary. Behind you is your natural habitat, as it were, the ground of your creaturely being, the old haunts where you were nurtured; in front of you is a less knowable prospect of invitation and challenge, the testing ground of your possibilities. You stand between whatever binds you to your past and whatever might be unbounded in your future.</p>
        <p>Anita Hill  Professor. Simmons College, Boston.</p>
        <p>First question that I want to ask you is, and I want you to really seriously ponder this, are you happy with the person you are today?</p>
        <p>Did you keep the promises you made to yourself and apply all of your energies and resources to soak up every ounce of learning and life at Simmons and Boston? And on your way to this degree, did you help a child learn to read or do long division or, more likely today, write a computer program?</p>
        <p>Did you visit an elder, listen to her story and learn to see the world vividly through dimmed and failing eyes? Did you maintain, or in some cases develop, a sense of humor, especially about yourself and even more importantly about the difficulties life sometimes brings?</p>
        <p>And finally, on your way to your current learned state, did you remember to keep those parts from birth that endeared you to your family -- the innocence, the wonder, the naivete? . . .</p>
        <p>Now I'm sure you're asking yourself, ''What's with all the questions? Classes are over!'' Well, consider this the last exam that you will have, and it's one you don't even have to take. It certainly isn't going to be graded; it's a self-examination.</p>
        <p>Julian Bond  N.A.A.C.P. chairman. Washington University, St. Louis.</p>
        <p>If we can shrink the world's population to a village of only 100 people, keeping all existing ratios the same, that village would look like this: there would be 57 Asians, 21 Europeans, 14 from the Western Hemisphere -- north and south -- and 21 Africans; 52 would be female; 70 would be nonwhite and 30 white; 70 would be non-Christian and 30 would be Christian.</p>
        <p>Six of the 100 people would own 59 percent of all the wealth in the world, and all 6 of those people would be from the United States. Eighty of the 100 people would live in substandard housing. Seventy would be unable to read and write. Fifty would suffer from malnutrition. One would have a college education.</p>
        <p>Bill Amend  Cartoonist. Amherst College, Amherst, Mass.</p>
        <p>For a graduating senior, it's got to be like music from heaven to hear that an Amherst education can actually lead to a job where you can wear sweats all day, sleep in late, play your stereo all you want, and get paid lots of money to draw silly little pictures in between games of Quake on your computer. . . .</p>
        <p>Knowing you have an audience, especially one that matters to you, can be utterly paralyzing. The fear of failure, the weight of expectation, the indecision that comes from striving for perfection can transform even simple tasks into brain-melting impossibilities. But knowing you have an audience can also elevate you to do more than you might otherwise. And to do it better. To consider what you're doing from more that one view.</p>
        <p>As a syndicated cartoonist, I have a huge audience. They tell me it's over 25 million readers. This might be cause for a little intimidation were it not for my handy science background reminding me that this is merely one 250-billionth the number of sodium ions in a single grain of salt. Trust me, anybody can write for salt.</p>
        <p>Henry G. Cisneros  President of Univision Communications. Occidental College, Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Over the years I have learned that the people who are the most successful, the people I have admired the most, are not necessarily those who are the most brilliant, or witty, or have mastered a particular discipline, but those who had the stamina to stay the course over a long period of time. . . . It's like the difference between the shooting star that flashes across the sky and is gone -- you're not even sure it was there -- and the North Star that is there every night, night after night.</p>
        <p>Desmond Tutu  Retired Archbishop of Cape Town, South Africa. Brandeis University, Waltham, Mass.</p>
        <p>You know the story of the farmer who in his backyard had chicken, and then he had a chicken that was a little odd looking. . . . It behaved like a chicken. It was pecking away like other chickens. It didn't know that there was a blue sky overhead and a glorious sunshine until someone who was knowledgeable in these things came along and said to the farmer, ''Hey, that's no chicken. That's an eagle.'' . . .</p>
        <p>And this man took this strange-looking chicken and climbed the mountain and waited until sunrise. And then he turned this strange-looking chicken towards the sun and said, ''Eagle, fly, eagle.'' And the strange-looking chicken shook itself, spread out its pinions and lifted off and soared and soared and soared and flew away, away into the distance.</p>
        <p>George F. Will  Columnist. Lafayette College, Easton, Pa.</p>
        <p>The demoralization of society is advanced when the word ''values'' supplants the word ''virtues'' in political and ethical contexts. When we move beyond talk of good and evil, when the categories virtue and vice are transcended, we are left with the thin gruel of values talk.</p>
        <p>Unlike virtues, everyone has lots of values. Everyone has as many as they choose! Hitler had lots of values. George Washington had virtues.</p>
        <p>Values are an equal-opportunity business. They are mere choices. In contrast, virtues are habits, difficult to develop and therefore not accessible to all. Therefore, speaking of virtues rather than values is elitist, offensive to democracy's egalitarian, leveling ethos, which I say is precisely why talk of virtues should be revived and talk of values should be abandoned.</p>
        <p>The purpose of American higher education is not to serve as a values cafeteria where young people are encouraged to pick whichever strikes their fancy. Rather, the purpose of higher education for citizens of a democracy should be to help them identify excellence in its various realms and to understand what virtues make it so.</p>
        <p>George J. Mitchell  Former senator. Washington &amp; Jefferson College, Washington, Pa.</p>
        <p>John Gardner put it best when he wrote: ''An excellent plumber is infinitely more admirable than an incompetent philosopher. The society which scorns excellence in plumbing because plumbing is a humble activity, and tolerates shoddiness in philosophy because it is an exalted activity, will have neither good plumbing nor good philosophy. Neither its pipes nor its theories will hold water.''</p>
        <p>Madeleine K. Albright  Secretary of state. University of California at Berkeley.</p>
        <p>During the century just passed, we humans learned how to transplant hearts, fly spaceships, clone sheep and squeeze a library's worth of data into a single slender disk.</p>
        <p>But as world events reflect, we remain far from mastering the art of human relations. We have invented no technology that will guide us to the destinations that matter most.</p>
        <p>After two world wars, the Holocaust, multiple genocides and countless conflicts, we must ask how long it will be before we are able to rise above the national, racial and gender distinctions that divide us and embrace the common humanity that binds us.</p>
        <p>The answer depends not on the stars of some mysterious forces of history; it depends on the choices that you and I and all of us make.</p>
        <p>Benjamin S. Carson  Pediatric neurosurgeon. Ursinus College, Collegeville, Pa.</p>
        <p>How many of you remember your birthday? Can I just see your hands? . . . Now what did your brain have to do for you to respond to that question?</p>
        <p>Give you an example of the sophistication of your brain: First of all the sound waves had to leave my lips, enter your auditory meatus, travel down to the tympanic membrane, set up a vibratory force, which traveled across the ossicles of your middle ear to the oval and round windows, setting up a vibratory force in the endolymph, which mechanically distorted the microcilia, converting mechanical energy to electrical energy, which traveled across the cochlear nerve to the cochlear nucleus to the pons-to-medullary juncture, from there to the superior olivary nucleus ascending bilaterally up the brain stem to the lateral lemniscus and the anterior colliculus and the medial geniculate nuclei across the thalamic radiations to the posterior temporal lobes, going through the frontal lobes, coming down the . . .</p>
        <p>Anyway! You get the point. And that's the simplified version of what your brain had to do. It can do much more complex things than that and you barely have to think about it. So with a brain like that, why would anybody ever utter the words ''I can't?''</p>
        <p>Judy Chicago  Artist. Smith College, Northampton, Mass.</p>
        <p>I believe that one of the pernicious lies that has been told to your generation is that one can have it all. Although I can't explain how I knew it, I always knew that this was not possible. Again, I looked to history and discovered that those women who had achieved at the level at which I had set my sights had been childless and those that were not had suffered constant guilt at not being able to meet the demands of both their work and their children. And, believe me, I understand the irony of bringing this up on Mother's Day.</p>
        <p>Although I would be the first to say that this situation is not a fair one, I must also state that I would hate for you to discover that choices must be made after you had already made those whose consequences will shape your life for years to come. I believe that it is important to be clear about your goals and to be willing to shape your life in a way that makes them possible to achieve.</p>
        <p>John Wallach  Founder of Seeds of Peace. University of Southern Maine, Portland.</p>
        <p>In a vastly expanding global economy with ever faster and faster communication, there is also a danger we'll lose touch with each other, with our own humanity. People may become pixels on a screen. You can already stay home, or as that full-page ad shows, be on the summit of a mountain in Nevada with your laptop, and e-mail the office, get your paycheck via satellite, pay your bills and order what you want and have it delivered -- without getting up out of your chair. You can access your e-mail or eBay or stocks or sports scores on your cell phone. Soon you'll be able to read an electronic book with e-ink, then plug the book in, delete its contents and receive another whole book.</p>
        <p>Internet Telephony will soon revolutionize chat rooms. You'll be able to go online and chat with someone in China -- and see them. You'll be able to learn creative writing from Stephen King himself. Today, you can already have sex on the Internet, without the trauma of being rejected.</p>
        <p>Are we entering an era when you will never really touch or feel another human being? . . . Will we use this new technology to become closer? Or farther apart?</p>
        <p>Oprah Winfrey  Talk-show host. Salem College, Winston-Salem, N.C.</p>
        <p>What is your purpose, what is your calling? . . .</p>
        <p>What I know for sure is if you ask the question the answer will come. What I know for sure is, you have to be willing to listen for the answer. You have to get still enough to learn it and hear it and pay attention, to be fully conscious enough to see not just with your eyes but through them to the truth of who you are and what you can be.</p>
        <p>What I know for sure is, you cannot run your life without surrender. . . . What I know for sure is that God can dream a bigger dream for you than you can dream for yourself. Surrender to the universe's dream for you. . . .</p>
        <p>What I know for sure? You cannot let other people define your life for you. You are the author of your own life and your job is to align your will with that which is the greater will. . . .</p>
        <p>You know what real power is? Real power is when you are doing exactly you are supposed to be doing the best it can be done. Authentic power. There's a surge, there's a kind of energy field that says, ''I'm in my groove. I'm in my groove.'' And nobody has to tell you, ''You go girl,'' because, you know, you're already gone.</p>
        <p>Herbert W. Boyer  Founder of Genentech Inc. University of Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>One thing we have come to know is that our genes are not very different from many of our fellow travelers. Genes can be interchanged between man, mice, yeast and fruit flies. . . . Wonder is what sets us apart from all other life forms. . . . No other species wonders about the meaning of existence or the complexity of the universe or themselves. . . .</p>
        <p>It can be argued that we will never understand anything in complete detail. Our knowledge is cumulative and ever changing. If we manage to survive and evolve we have about five billion years to work on it. It is difficult to imagine a world in which there is nothing left to wonder about.</p>
        <p>Mumia Abu-Jamal  Death row inmate. Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio.</p>
        <p>Who do you admire? . . . On any given list, if logical, the following figures will be found: Nelson Mandela, Malcolm X, Ella Baker, and W. E. B. DuBois. . . . Add Paul Robeson to that list. Does that help? How about Angela Y. Davis. . . .</p>
        <p>We admire these people because, at critical junctures of their lives, they cast their lot with the oppressed, the poor, the worker or those in the third world. Now they didn't do this because it was popular; quite the contrary, it was quite dangerous for many of these people. . . .</p>
        <p>They joined, aided and/or formed the movements that they did because it was the right thing to do. . . .</p>
        <p>Have those lives had impact? Their lives have expanded the very notion of what freedom means in the minds of millions. . . . Their lives teach us all what it means to betray one's class, to contribute to the movements that have meaning and to work on behalf of the oppressed. You, at this commencement at Antioch, have the somewhat unique opportunity to prove that old axiom, that man is made for more than meat and life is more than bread.</p>
        <p>Andy Rooney  Humorist. University of Virginia, Charlottesville.</p>
        <p>We need more doctors and fewer medical programs. We need more mechanics and fewer car salesmen. We need more good television programs and fewer commercials.</p>
        <p>Someone has to make something. I mean, who's going to rebuild those 250 houses that burned down last week in Los Alamos? An interactive communications network? A virtual meeting? I don't think so. It's going to take carpenters, plumbers and electricians.</p>
        <p>When I don't have anything else to think about, I think about whether all of mankind cumulatively . . . whether we're all happier or not, or less happy, than we used to be. Used to be 100 years ago, 2,000 years ago, when people were living in caves without electric light, without automobiles, without airplanes, televisions, without computers, even without Diet Coke, are we happier now that we have all those things? . . . I'm puzzled about whether we're any smarter than people were at 1,000 or 10,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>Don't rule out working with your hands. It does not preclude using your head. There's no reason why education should be incompatible with craftsmanship. . . . I can imagine not too far in the future a carpenter making $250,000 a year building a house for a computer programmer making $150,000 a year.</p>
        <p>William Julius Wilson  Professor. Macalester College, St. Paul.</p>
        <p>As a new millennium dawns, the eradication of extreme poverty ought to be one of our most urgent and important goals. Extreme poverty breeds disease and shortens life expectancy. It reduces the aspirations and severely limits the potential of children, many of whom cannot and do not envision the future, free of deprivation and despair.</p>
        <p>In today's modern world, there is no reason why hundreds of millions of people and families have to live in extreme poverty. There is no reason why hundreds of millions of children have to grow up with little hope for a brighter future. Given the impact of modern technology, the unlimited growth and material resources and surplus wealth, it is possible to ensure that every man, woman and child experience a modicum of economic welfare.</p>
        <p>B. D. Wong  Actor. School of Visual Arts, New York.</p>
        <p>I've never been to a college commencement before. No, seriously, this is my first college commencement. Really. . . . Yeah, who knew that I would ever be able to thumb my nose at that lame-o state university I went to in my hometown for like 20, by standing up here in front of you all, all official and all. Being all wise. Having something to say. . . .</p>
        <p>I am asking you to commit yourself today to choosing the fork of integrity. . . . From this moment on, commit yourself to that original vision, honor and cherish that original vision, and be faithful to it. Yes, marry it. Get hitched. The old ball and chain. . . . Those of you truly self-involved, singularly brilliant artists, will have terrible trouble keeping relationships anyway, so you better marry something. . . .</p>
        <p>You won't be hearing from me when they say, ''If there is anyone here who knows why these artists should not be joined to their futures, speak now or forever hold your peace.'' When you receive that diploma, say ''I do,'' and marry yourself to that original vision. . . . I now pronounce you artists and lives.</p>
