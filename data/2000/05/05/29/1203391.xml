        <p>New York Mets pitcher Rick Reed, who strained muscle, will miss next start (M)2</p>

        <p>The Mets right-hander Rick Reed, who left Saturday's start after three innings with a strained left oblique muscle, was still sore today and will skip his next start. ''I'm going to miss a start, there's no doubt about it,'' Reed said. ''It's something that's not going to heal overnight, obviously.''</p>
        <p>Reed felt a sharp pain in his left side while throwing his warm-ups Saturday. He said he tried too hard to compensate for the discomfort, leading to his worst outing of the year: three innings, five runs on seven hits and three walks, and a 5-0 lead squandered.</p>

        <p>The Mets came back to win, 12-8, but Manager Bobby Valentine said he was disappointed Reed did not mention the problem until after the third inning.</p>
        <p>Reed's next turn in the rotation falls on Thursday, an off day. Valentine said he would skip Reed, hoping he could make his next start on June 6.</p>
