        <p>During the last gubernatorial elections, several regional governors lost their seats in multi-candidate contests. In contrast, no Russian leader has ever been defeated by ballot.</p>

        <p>Your May 22 news article implies that most of Russia's regional governors are authoritarian, when in fact some regions are more democratic than the federal government in Moscow.</p>
        <p>During the last gubernatorial elections, several regional governors lost their seats in multi-candidate contests. In contrast, no Russian leader has ever been defeated by ballot.</p>
        <p>And President Vladimir V. Putin's war in Chechnya can hardly be considered an exercise in democracy. No Russian governor is currently waging a war against his own population.</p>
        <p>In many regions, local legislatures and the judiciary are independent of the governor while the equivalent federal branches are dominated by the president.</p>
        <p>It would be a mistake to assume that Mr. Putin's move to tighten his rule over the regions would be a step toward a more democratic Russia.</p>
