        <p>Coach Bill Tierney of Princeton scanned the field uneasily Saturday and saw a strange mix of players in the waning minutes of the men's lacrosse national semifinal against Virginia. The coach saw untested Tigers: the freshmen Josh White and Sean Hartofilis and the sophomore attack Brendan Tierney, his son.</p>
        <p>He paused. There were two minutes remaining, and after trailing the Cavaliers for 43 minutes, the Tigers were tied, 11-11.</p>
        <p>''Are you sure you've got the people you want out there?'' he asked his offensive coach, David Metzbower.</p>
        <p>''Coach, we're O.K.,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Seconds later, Brendan Tierney received a pass from White and shoved a shot past Cavalier goalie Derek Kenney for his second goal of the game, both in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Tierney's son Brendan, who had been maligned in discussion groups on the Internet for being too small and too slow to play major college lacrosse and for capitalizing on his family connection at Princeton, had won the game. The coach's other son, the junior goalie Trevor Tierney, had preserved the victory with 14 saves.</p>
        <p>When asked about his sons' performances, Tierney bowed his head. ''You try so hard when coaching your sons not to be too hard or too soft on them,'' he said softly. ''It's a hard situation. It's hard to put into words what this means. It's every coach's dream, every dad's dream, and it all came together today.''</p>
        <p>The Tierneys and the rest of the third-seeded Tigers (12-2) will meet No. 1 Syracuse (14-1) Monday at 10:55 a.m. in the national title game. On April 23, the Orangemen raked the Tigers, 16-4. It was the worst Princeton defeat in 10 years.</p>
        <p>The game took place the day after Princeton sewed up the Ivy League championship by defeating Cornell. In that game the Tigers lost their second-leading scorer, the sophomore attack B. J. Prager, to injury. The reeling Tigers, unprepared and unsettled, staggered into the Carrier Dome and got crushed.</p>
        <p>Syracuse said it was ready for the revamped Tigers. ''This is a new season,'' said the Orangemen senior Tim Byrnes, citing Princeton's 5-0 record in title games. ''We're definitely playing a different team now.''</p>
        <p>Syracuse is the only team Princeton has lost to in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament since 1992. Against all other teams, the Tigers are 16-0. Against Syracuse, they are 3-3, including a 7-5 loss last year in the first round.</p>
        <p>In 1992 the third-seeded Tigers upset top-seeded Syracuse by 10-9 for their first N.C.A.A. title, despite not having any superstars. The current no-name Tigers cling to that victory as proof of the impossible.</p>
        <p>''We're an unbelievable bunch of overachievers,'' Trevor Tierney said. ''When I was a freshman, we were the team to beat. Now everybody is counting on us to lose.''</p>
        <p>It is a team that has relied on his slick saves. His 4.64 goals against average in Ivy League games was the lowest in league play since 1981.  Overall, he has a 7.57 goals against average and a .643 save percentage.</p>
        <p>For Trevor Tierney, the decision to play for his father was an easy one. Four years ago the coach was sitting at home when the phone, the one he used for recruiting, rang. He was ready to talk to a talented high school senior and roll out his best pitch.</p>
        <p>''Is this Coach Tierney?'' a young voice asked politely.</p>
        <p>''Who's this?'' the coach said.</p>
        <p>''Trevor Tierney.''</p>
        <p>''What are you doing?''</p>
        <p>''I wanted to let you know that I'm coming to Princeton.''</p>
        <p>They laughed.</p>
        <p>''It was exciting to get him,'' Tierney the coach said. ''We weren't sure if we were going to.''</p>
        <p>For Brendan Tierney, the choice was not as easy. ''I kind of wanted to get away for my whole life, like any normal teenager,'' he said. ''But it's hard to turn down such a great lacrosse program and the best education in the world.''</p>
        <p>So the brothers gritted their teeth when their father yells at them on the field, biting back responses they would blare out at home. The father forces himself through painful moments, like when he pulled Trevor after a poor first quarter last year against North Carolina.</p>
        <p>And they both know that when the coach screams on the sideline, his face red, it is a field persona and nothing personal. Not everyone knows that.</p>
        <p>''People think my dad is a raving maniac all the time,'' Trevor Tierney said. ''But he's a great dad.''</p>
        <p>And not a bad coach, either.</p>
