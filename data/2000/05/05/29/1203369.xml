        <p>After making it safely to the United States, Hans Peter Bieri faced the same problem that millions of illegal immigrants had faced over the years.  He had to persuade employers, government agencies and others that he was here legally.</p>
        <p>It was not long before Mr. Bieri discovered the little secret that for years has helped some illegal immigrants stay in the United States: in some states, like California, it is possible to adopt the identity of an American citizen by simply walking into the right government office and paying a few dollars for someone's birth certificate.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Bieri, a Swiss citizen, found a California native close to him in age and, knowing little more than his name and birth date, got a copy of his birth certificate from the local county clerk's office. Then, using the birth certificate as identification, Mr. Bieri got a California driver's license and later, during a visit to Hawaii, an American passport.</p>
        <p>Now he had three documents backing up his claim to American citizenship, and he began building a new life. He married, became a father and settled near Houston.</p>
        <p>It all fell apart last October -- 11 years after Mr. Bieri arrived in the country -- when the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service acted on a call from the man whose identity Mr. Bieri had assumed.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Bieri was caught, his case showed why experts considered the birth certificate to be the soft underbelly of America's interior defenses against illegal immigration.</p>
        <p>The Immigration and Naturalization Service says it seizes dozens of fraudulent birth certificates every day, either counterfeit copies or valid ones acquired by impostors.</p>
        <p>''The birth certificate is really the document of choice'' for illegal immigrants, said James R. Hesse, chief intelligence officer at the agency's Forensic Document Laboratory.</p>
        <p>''It shows both identity and nationality, and that's a big deal.''</p>
        <p>Because of that, Mr. Hesse said, the birth certificate can open the door to other documents coveted by illegal immigrants, like Social Security cards, driver's licenses and passports. The birth certificate is the document most frequently presented as evidence of American citizenship by first-time applicants for a passport, the State Department says.</p>
        <p>California, home to 40 percent of the 5 million to 6 million illegal immigrants that the immigration service estimates live in the United States, is particularly vulnerable to birth certificate fraud. An official at the Ventura County recorder's office said that to get a certified copy of someone's birth certificate, ''you just need to know the name on the birth certificate and the date of birth.'' The cost is $12, and the wait about 15 minutes, she said.</p>
        <p>The process is even easier in other counties. The Web site for Butte County in Northern California simply says to ''give as much information as possible'' along with the $12 fee when requesting a birth certificate, which can be done by mail.</p>
        <p>While studying the issue as a member of the Commission on Immigration Reform, a bipartisan group formed by Congress in 1990 to study United States immigration policy, Michael S. Teitelbaum was so shocked to hear how easy it was to get someone's birth certificate in California that he decided to try it.</p>
        <p>He went to the county clerk-recorder's office in Orange County and requested the birth certificate of someone he knew was born in the area. Within 15 minutes, he had a certified copy of the person's birth certificate. ''I basically walked out of there shaking my head in disbelief,'' said Mr. Teitelbaum, now a program director at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, a nonprofit philanthropic institution in New York.</p>
        <p>Now that office says that people asking for birth certificates in person may be asked to show picture identification. But all that is needed by mail is ''the person's full name, date of birth, and a credit card number,'' an official said.</p>
        <p>California is not the only state with such loose restrictions on access to birth records. An official at the Office of Vital Statistics in Frankfort, Ky., said that a name and birth date were enough to get a copy of a Kentucky native's birth certificate.</p>
        <p>In most states, however, the full names of both parents, including the mother's maiden name, must be provided to get a birth certificate. But critics say that the system is only as strong as its weakest link, because a birth certificate from a state with loose restrictions can be used to establish residency and employment eligibility in any other state.</p>
        <p>And even in the strictest states, the information required for obtaining a birth certificate can often be found easily, critics say. One way is to scan the obituary pages of a local newspaper and write down the background information on a person of the appropriate age. Since most states do not match death and birth records, or do so very slowly, experts say, illegal immigrants assuming the identity of the recently deceased face little risk of detection.</p>
        <p>The fraudulent acquisition of valid birth certificates is only part of the problem. The I.N.S. says that birth certificates are vulnerable to counterfeiting, largely because there is no single national standard for them. Instead of one version, thousands of different but valid birth certificates flow from the more than 7,000 local and state agencies authorized to issue them.</p>
        <p>That makes detection of counterfeits difficult, Mr. Hesse said. In 1994, the Commission on Immigration Reform recommended that the federal government adopt one standard design for all certified copies of birth certificates. Almost six years later, no such design exists.</p>
        <p>The commission also recommended a nationwide system for matching birth and death records, limiting the types of birth certificates accepted by federal agencies, standardized application forms for birth certificates and computerized storage of birth records by each state. None of those recommendations have been carried out.</p>
        <p>Robert C. Hill, the head of the commission, said the ''foot-dragging'' by Congress and the Clinton administration on birth certificate reform was ''indicative of a sort of attitude of neglect for overall reform'' that would prevent unauthorized employment of immigrants.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the I.N.S., under prodding from Congress, has been meeting with state and local officials during the last year to determine how to regulate the issuance of birth certificates. Susan Martin, the director of the Institute for the Study of International Migration at Georgetown University, said that if Congress expected to achieve real reform, it needed to provide more financial support for the agency. The movement toward reform has begun, she said, and ''now it's an issue of putting serious resources into it.''</p>
