        <p>In a Tale of Two Offerings, Best of Times Ends for One  On the list of 1999's best initial public offerings, Ditech Communications and FreeMarkets were among the best performers, with Ditech's stock ending the year up 611 percent from its offering price and FreeMarkets' ending with a gain of 750 percent.</p>
        <p>But that was then, and this is now. So far in 2000, their fates have diverged as much as any two stocks could. Ditech's share price is up nearly 90 percent this year, while FreeMarkets' is down by nearly the same amount. Unfortunately, FreeMarkets is more representative of what has happened to last year's hot new offerings than is Ditech, showing just how far stocks can fall when market sentiment shifts.

        <p>Lucent Seen in Deal for Chromatis  Moving to expand its presence in the fast-changing optical-networking sector, Lucent Technologies, North America's No. 1 maker of communications equipment, is in advanced negotiations to acquire Chromatis Networks, a small private company, for as much as $5.5 billion in stock, people close to the companies said over the weekend.

        <p>'Convergence' Still a Blank Slate  Of all of the buzzwords in the technology industry, perhaps none is invoked as reflexively as ''convergence,'' the melding of television, the telephone system and the Internet into an interactive world of information and entertainment. But convergence is not really happening, at least not yet. And when it does, it will probably take forms much different than those generally envisioned today. New Economy. [C3.]</p>
        <p>E-Darwinism May Not Spare Fittest  The recent closings of Toysmart, CraftShop.com, Brandwise.com and Boo.com have been the most visible e-commerce casualties to date, and the consensus within the Internet industry is that more closings will follow quickly. But analysts disagree about the meaning of the recent closings. Some say the shakeout represents a healthy dose of digital Darwinism. But others suggest that as investors continue their wholesale rejection of consumer e-commerce companies, they may be condemning some companies that deserve a better fate.

        <p>Film Web Sites Breaking Old Ground  The film industry loves the familiarity of sequels, so it comes as no surprise that the Web sites for this year's roster of potential summer box-office blockbusters are mostly formulaic rehashes of past sites. Media. [C7.]</p>
        <p>Salon Changes Prompt Complaints  Salon introduced a redesigned site last week, and it did not take long before critiques started pouring in by e-mail: the site had technical bugs; it was too cluttered; its new, smaller type font was too hard to read. Salon's editor, David Talbot, said Salon was tinkering with the site to fix the bugs and to address concerns about the font size. But Salon's readers are not the only audience that matters. Mr. Talbot also said that the redesign gave more prominent placement to advertisers and made it easier to find room for continuous breaking news. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Plot Twist for Giuliani Biographies  At first, the furor over the personal life of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, left, might have seemed like the ultimate publicity blitz for two New York journalists -- Wayne Barrett, an investigative reporter for The Village Voice, and Andrew Kirtzman, a political reporter for New York One, the cable TV news station -- who are rushing to complete biographies of the mayor. But now that Mr. Giuliani has withdrawn from the Senate race, publishing experts wonder whether the books have lost their urgency. Mr. Kirtzman said he would revise his introduction, and in his final chapter track the mayor as he agonized over his final decision. Mr. Barrett said he had added chapters to include this month's roller coaster ride for his book. [C7.]</p>
        <p>Inquiries Begun Into Airline Deal  The attorneys general of New York and Pennsylvania have begun inquiries into the effect the proposed United Airlines acquisition of US Airways would have on competition. [C4.]</p>
        <p>U.S. Markets Closed for Holiday  Financial markets, banks and government offices are closed today in observance of Memorial Day. In addition, markets, government offices and most businesses are closed in Britain for the spring bank holiday. Most other foreign markets are open.</p>
