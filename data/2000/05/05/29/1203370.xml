        <p>It is fitting that Robert Kaplan's slim book ''The Nothing That Is'' is a portrait of the numeral zero. The Harvard mathematician is among a wave of mostly scholarly writers whose recent books have left nothing in the place usually reserved for the pages upon pages where scholars lay out the sources for their findings and opinions.</p>
        <p>To skim through the 78 pages of bibliography for Mr. Kaplan's 225-page book, look elsewhere -- namely on the Internet, where the material resides on a Web site belonging to his publisher, Oxford University Press.</p>
        <p>In a growing number of instances involving both trade publishers and prominent academic publishers, bibliographies -- the traditional structural support system for an author's work -- have been severed from books and moved to digital outposts.</p>
        <p>There, publishers say, they are available to anyone who wants to read them; a note in the book gives the Web address where the bibliography can be found. The advantage, the publishers say, is a smaller, cheaper, more accessible book.</p>
        <p>Some authors, perhaps surprisingly, support the change, while others have fiercely opposed it.</p>
        <p>''Certainly we're encouraging our authors to put as much as they can on a Web site to try and clean up the books,'' said Larry Cohen, editor in chief of M.I.T. Press, which publishes scholarly and popular trade books. ''Manuscript sizes are getting longer and longer. We've been trying to figure out how to deal with it by separating parts of the book that perhaps a minority of readers would be interested in.''</p>
        <p>But not everyone agrees.</p>
        <p>''I think it's frightening,'' said Peter Lyman, a library science professor and former head of the campus library system at the University of California at Berkeley. ''Paper, by its nature, is a stable medium that will last for hundreds of years if it's acid-free and treated at a natural temperature and humidity. Digital material is fugitive, and most Web sites disappear in about 18 months. It's more than vanity to have a bibliography. It's part of a collaboration that stretches decades and maybe centuries.''</p>
        <p>Since the 18th century, the bibliography has underpinned the scholarship of books by organizing chaotic records of knowledge that came before. This list of references, titles and interviews that influence a new book is a road map for scholars and other readers, enabling them to follow the trail of supporting evidence for theories and controversial points.</p>
        <p>The decision to pare down books is provoking a practical intellectual debate among writers, publishers and archivists, and among its most provocative aspects is whether this sort of slice-and-dice Web publishing is an early step toward eliminating paper versions of some books.</p>
        <p>''I think the whole issue of a book is up for question,'' said Suzanne Calpestri, a librarian at the University of California at Berkeley who calls the division taking place grangerizing, which is an antique term for the clipping of book engravings. ''We don't know what kinds of issues are involved with maintaining equipment. We don't know how to save bytes for centuries. We know that rag paper has lasted for hundreds of years, but the digital is so ephemeral with changing platforms and equipment. Will you even be able to read it 15 years from now?''</p>
        <p>Many academic and trade publishers experimenting with these evolving forms concede that no one knows the answer to that question. The Library of Congress, for example, is seeking money for pilot programs on preserving digital material.</p>
        <p>Preservation is ''one of the key issues in our world,'' said Marlie Wasserman, the director of Rutgers University Press and president of the Association of American University Presses, which represents about 120 major academic publishers. ''There really are no standards that have been universally accepted, and it's a major problem.''</p>
        <p>The lack of answers notwithstanding, some publishers contend that splitting up a book is a way to sell, package and price a title in a commercially more appealing format.</p>
        <p>The information from the back of the book is a natural choice for excision, they say, because of the prevailing view that only a small portion of readers use the material. The word bibliography is derived from the Greek bibliographia, which literally means the writing of books; scholars often refer to this material as ''the academic apparatus.''</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, some writers feel fiercely proud of this trove of sources because it conveys the extent of their work and gives their theories more credibility. In March the writer Jill Watts was asked by her publisher, Oxford University Press, to consider an electronic split of the notes and bibliography from her yet-to-be-published portrait of Mae West, which explores the influence black culture had on the actress's performances.</p>
        <p>Ms. Watts, an associate professor of history at California State University at San Marcos, said she was stunned and started asking other writers and academics for advice.</p>
        <p>''If what's on the Internet doesn't last forever, then we've lost power,'' she said. ''If the academic apparatus disappears, then we're moving back to an earlier period when authors weren't citing sources and could just say whatever they wanted. We're coming out of an industrial-oriented society that wanted everything to be added up and quantified into a virtual society where that's less valuable.''</p>
        <p>With the agreement of her editor, Ms. Watts decided to include her bibliography and look for pages of notes and text to trim instead.</p>
        <p>One reason university presses show enthusiasm for severing notes and bibliographies is that they are often financially pressed. To expand readership and revenue, these publishers are trying to offer books that can find a popular market, and that means packaging that is not too weighty or academic.</p>
        <p>''We're realizing that an author can put the core ideas into a book,'' Ms. Wasserman said. ''But the kind of scholarly apparatus that went on for pages and pages -- that we had to knock down trees for -- can be posted on a Web site without interfering with the sales of a book.''</p>
        <p>Rutgers University Press is just starting to experiment with the idea. Recently the publisher asked one of its authors, Stephen G. Brush, to shorten a newly revised 500-page textbook, ''Physics: The Human Adventure.'' Instead of rewriting and trimming the text, Mr. Brush, a professor of science history at the University of Maryland, compromised with the publisher by agreeing to post his 100-page bibliography online.</p>
        <p>''It remains to be seen whether this will work,'' he said. ''It hasn't even been agreed whether the author maintains the site or the publisher does.'' He, too, regards the shift as a baby step toward something bigger. ''What I'm worried about is the pressure to put a book just entirely online,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The question of who maintains the sites leads to even more questions. If it's the author's duty, what happens in the case of illness or death? If it's the publisher's job, what if the publisher goes under?</p>
        <p>M.I.T. Press encountered some of these problems recently after a textbook author, a professor, went on sabbatical; for the last six months the professor has been unavailable to repair a Web site that includes an instructors' manual that, readers have complained, has suddenly become inaccessible.</p>
        <p>Some large publishers of popular trade books, like Random House, say they are not asking writers to divide titles into electronic and paper sections. But several authors said that other major publishers were beginning to raise the idea.</p>
        <p>One author said her publisher had asked about splitting off the bibliography but compromised by agreeing to put other information, like charts and illustrations, online instead.</p>
        <p>Other writers, however, are pressing for such divisions. Robin Marantz Henig said she asked her publisher, Houghton Mifflin, if she could detach the reference section from ''The Monk in the Garden,'' her new biography of the path-breaking genetic scientist Gregor Mendel. The publisher approved.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people take shortcuts and don't tell readers about the references for the sake of not weighing down a book,'' she said. ''This allows me to be serious about the references but not ponderous in the book. People ask me about whether Mendel fudged his data. This allows me to post the 1936 paper that suggested he might have and other papers that reassessed that information.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaplan, the author of ''The Nothing That Is'' (1999), is still evaluating the results of his experiment with a divided book. His electronic references have enabled him to make his bibliography organic -- constantly growing with feedback from reviewers and readers. And he credits the book's unexpected success to its slim size and format.</p>
        <p>''There was no other option,'' Mr. Kaplan explained. ''The publisher wanted to have the success that it wouldn't have if it was a larger, thicker book with a more scholarly appearance. And I didn't want my book to be published without a bibliography to back up what are often new and controversial points.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaplan's editorial director at Oxford, Peter Ginna, said the book was one of the company's top sellers. Still, there are issues to be worked out. The Italian and German translations of the book failed to make note of the existence of a Web site. Some reviewers criticized Mr. Kaplan for the lack of a bibliography, failing to see the reader's note in the front that said the material was on the Web.</p>
        <p>And one professor in Dublin simply could not download the information from the bibliography, whose references range from ''Khandakhadyaka, an Astronomical Treatise of Brahamagupta,'' an Indian treatise written in 1934, to ''The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat'' by Oliver Sacks, which was published in 1985 (with a bibliography).</p>
        <p>In that case, there was an old-fashioned, low-tech solution. Oxford University Press printed out copies of the bibliography and dispatched snail mail to Ireland.</p>
