        <p>Social Security has emerged as a critical issue in this year's presidential campaign, but neither candidate seems prepared to address the system's long-term financial problems. Instead, Gov. George W.

Neither proposal would really stabilize the system in the long run. In truth, though Social Security is projected to become bankrupt in four decades, the system is not all that far out of kilter.

        <p>Social Security has emerged as a critical issue in this year's presidential campaign, but neither candidate seems prepared to address the system's long-term financial problems. Instead, Gov. George W. Bush wants to let individuals invest a small part of their Social Security contributions in the stock market, where he thinks they will earn a better return, and Vice President Al Gore proposes to keep the system largely intact with an infusion of general tax revenues. Neither proposal would really stabilize the system in the long run. In truth, though Social Security is projected to become bankrupt in four decades, the system is not all that far out of kilter. It would not be hard for bold politicians to devise a fix.</p>
        <p>Social Security may well be, as Governor Bush has said, ''the single most successful government program in American history.'' It was created in 1935, during the depths of the depression, to provide a guaranteed income to retired workers for as long as they live. Unlike private pension plans, Social Security benefits keep pace with inflation and, unlike 401(k)'s and other popular private plans, Social Security benefits do not fluctuate with stock and bond markets. Social Security provides the majority of income for most retirees and all the income for about a fifth of the elderly.</p>
        <p>From its inception, the system has taken in payroll taxes from the working generation and turned almost all of them over to retirees. At the core of Social Security are the notions of social insurance -- everyone participates in a common plan -- and redistribution -- the program tilts in favor of low-paid workers. The benefits for low-paid workers are about 80 percent of their average lifetime earnings, while benefits for high-paid workers are about 30 percent of average earnings. The progressive formula has cut the poverty rate among the elderly by two-thirds, reducing their poverty to below that of the general population. That is a remarkable triumph.</p>
        <p>The question before voters is whether a program born out of depression -- when poverty was rampant, few married women worked for pay and no one had 401(k)'s or I.R.A.'s to provide for retirement -- needs to be revamped.</p>
        <p>One reason for thinking so is the projected bankruptcy -- a sobering but manageable situation. The system will run surpluses for the next 15 years, building a large reserve. But in 2010, the first wave of the baby boomers -- the nearly 80 million people born between 1946 and 1964 -- will begin to retire and collect retirement checks. The number of people in the work force for every retiree will fall from about five today to about three in only 30 years or so.  That, and the fact that people are living longer, will put a strain on workers to support the retirement needs of the elderly. The system will begin to run deficits around 2015. By 2037, the trust fund is expected to be empty.</p>
        <p>But for all the talk of bankruptcy, the system is not facing irreparable financial crisis. Even after 2037, payroll taxes will cover about 70 percent of promised benefits. Deficits over the next 75 years, the planning horizon for the program, will equal less than 2 percent of total payrolls -- hardly a catastrophic shortfall. If the economy were to grow only slightly faster than the actuaries at the Social Security Administration now project, the deficit would disappear.</p>
        <p>One proposed remedy for financial imbalance is partial privatization, the approach favored  by Governor Bush. Under current law, workers  and employers pay a 12.4 percent payroll tax that goes into a public trust fund. Under partial privatization, workers could divert, say, two percentage points of that tax to private accounts that the worker could then invest in stocks and bonds. Workers would collect less money from the trust fund when they retired, alleviating financial strain on  the system. But they would expect to more than make up for the loss by drawing from their private accounts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's sketchy proposal fails to answer where he would find the money to pay retirees as payroll taxes were diverted into private accounts. But there are other fundamental problems with the proposal as well.</p>
        <p>Proponents of private accounts say that investors, based on data going back to the early 20th century, can expect to earn about 5 percent annually above inflation on a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. By contrast, the taxes they ''deposit'' in the trust fund will earn an implicit return -- measured in future retirement benefits -- of only 1 to 2 percent above inflation.</p>
        <p>But that comparison is highly misleading. Private accounts invested in stocks and bonds may well earn less than 5 percent because the economy is expected to slow over the next several decades as the population ages and because stock prices are now overvalued.</p>
        <p>More important, the advantage that proponents cite on behalf of private accounts is an optical illusion. The trust fund faces the burden of paying trillions of dollars beyond what payroll taxes raise over the next 75 years to provide the benefits  the system is obligated to pay current and future retirees. The sole reason that private accounts look like a better investment than the trust fund is that proponents assume the private accounts would  be relieved of the burden of helping to pay that obligation. But that just deflects the burden onto someone else, requiring Congress to slash retirement checks or other government spending, or to raise taxes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush cites as an advantage that private accounts can be invested in stocks whereas the trust fund by law cannot. But if the law were changed to let the trust fund itself purchase stocks, as President Clinton has proposed, it could invest in the markets far more cheaply than could private accounts. The cost of administering 150 million individual private accounts would be huge, eating away 20 percent or more of worker deposits. Private accounts could also subject individuals, including the poor, to unacceptable investment risk at the most vulnerable time in their lives. Worse, they undermine the principle of social insurance, setting individuals off to fend for themselves without looking out for the needy.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore proposes to leave the basic system unchanged and would use general revenues to extend the life of the trust fund to about 2050. He ducks proposing tax hikes or benefit cuts that would be needed to solve the system's problems after that date. Indeed, he does the opposite by proposing new benefits for stay-at-home mothers and for widows and widowers, thereby increasing the financial strain on the system.</p>
        <p>The wiser solution is for Congress to cut benefits and raise taxes modestly, which is all that would be needed to close the system's financial gap. Congress could require all state and local government workers to join the system, boosting its tax revenues. Congress could also raise the cap on earnings subject to the payroll tax, now set at $76,200, to keep pace with the rising earnings of high-paid workers. It could invest Social Security surpluses in private, high-paying bonds, or allow the trust fund itself to invest in stocks.</p>
        <p>Raising the payroll tax by, say, a half percentage point in 20 or 30 years or transferring a small fraction of general tax revenues into the trust fund would go a long way toward solving the problem. If these and similar measures do not close the entire gap, Congress could hasten the transition to the higher retirement age, 67, that Congress passed in the 1980's. The Social Security ''crisis'' is less drastic than it seems, and can be fixed with relatively modest changes.</p>
