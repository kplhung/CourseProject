        <p>Carl Craig is an international music star. Every weekend he is somewhere in the world performing before sold-out crowds of swooning teenagers and twenty-somethings. In Belgium and Australia, fans clamor for his autograph and a glimpse of his hazel eyes. In London and Paris, they wait hours to tell him how his music has changed their lives.</p>
        <p>But here in his hometown, the place that spawned the sound known  as Detroit techno, the 30-year-old Mr. Craig remains an unknown. For nearly two decades, the city that set the 60's to music with the Motown sound has largely closed its ears to its other musical offspring, the techno sound.</p>
        <p>Many people here barely regard the pulsating electronic drum beats and synthesized rhythms that is techno as music. Few stores stock the music, and only loyalists -- a few thousand folks in Detroit -- are willing to pay to see Mr. Craig and the half-dozen others who have made it famous behind their turntables, keyboards and computers.</p>
        <p>''Techno music has done as much for Detroit as Motown did,'' Mr. Craig said. ''People all over the world see Detroit as this mythological music scene; they kiss the ground when they come here because it's where it started. They have no idea it's still a secret here.''</p>
        <p>But this holiday weekend, Mr. Craig is raising techno's profile by presiding over the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, a free three-day outdoor dance party on the city's waterfront. Some say that holding the festival in Detroit is a gamble, considering the music's relative obscurity in the city. About 85 percent of the CD's and 12-inch vinyl singles produced by the more than 25 independent record labels here are sold overseas.</p>
        <p>But on Saturday, as thousands of baby-toting and droopy-jeans-wearing music lovers endured showers to listen to the first of 70 international acts performing on four stages, it appeared that techno might finally become a hit at home.</p>
        <p>Hanna Prothero and her husband, Iron, drove two days from Denver. The couple, in their 30's, discovered the music 11 years ago while in London. ''You couldn't find a better dance party in America if you paid for it,'' Mr. Prothero said of the festival.</p>
        <p>Others came from countries like Japan, France, Germany and Canada. Yosaku Hagiwara, 24, of Osaka, Japan, said, ''To see these guys for free in the city where it all happened, I think is so cool.''</p>
        <p>The media also came. There are  TV broadcasters from France, London and Tokyo, and Canadian national radio is broadcasting portions of the concert live.</p>
        <p>International journalists have not watched Detroit like this since the 1980's when arsonists celebrated Halloween by torching abandoned homes. That tradition, called Devil's Night, has since been extinguished.</p>
        <p>''Look at it out here,'' said DJ Hannah, scanning Saturday's crowd. Hannah, a 28-year-old disc jockey from Britain, moved here two years ago and is married to Mr. Craig. ''This music has brought the world to Detroit. Asian, white, black, blue. They're all here.''</p>
        <p>Nine years ago Kenny Larkin, who is performing this weekend, postponed his dream of becoming a comedian to play the music he heard rising out of dark after-hour clubs in the 1980's. Mr. Larkin, of Detroit, said that hometown acclaim is what he has most wanted.</p>
        <p>''It's so frustrating to have to get on a plane every other weekend and fly 9, 10 hours away to get respect,'' said Mr. Larkin, 32, who owns a record label and plays regularly in Madrid, Berlin and Dublin.</p>
        <p>Last year, he logged one million frequent flyer miles. Like most techno artists, he does not discuss how much he makes from his weekend jaunts or from record sales, which rarely exceed a few thousand copies for any artist.</p>
        <p>''We're on MTV over there,'' Mr. Larkin. ''The record stores give as much room to Detroit techno as they give to American pop and rock music. It's sad we can't get people over here to see us as a legitimate genre of music.''</p>
        <p>This weekend, Mr. Craig hopes to attract a specific market: young  blacks.</p>
        <p>While white teenagers have made electronic music popular -- and in some cases infamous because of its association with illegal rave parties and the drug ecstasy -- black teenagers have mostly written it off as suburban noise.</p>
        <p>''Techno is faceless,'' said Mr. Craig, who is black. ''They don't  know it's black music, that it was created by young black men in the same way hip-hop was. We were more interested in mastering the machines and seeing how far the music could go without being typecast as something that came from the ghetto.''</p>
        <p>Whether the festival succeeds or not, Mr. Craig said Detroit affords techno artists one luxury other celebrities cannot claim.</p>
        <p>''Michael Jackson and people like Prince dream of going shopping or out to dinner without someone trying to tear their clothes off,'' he said.  ''Nobody knows who we are. Yet.''</p>
