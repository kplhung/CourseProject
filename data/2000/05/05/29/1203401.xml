        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani went to Forest Hills, Queens, yesterday to march in the community's annual Memorial Day parade. But a group of residents did not let him get away without a special performance: They sang ''Happy Birthday'' for the mayor, who turned 56 yesterday.</p>
        <p>The birthday was yet another cause for the mayor, who has prostate cancer and is separating from his wife, to contemplate his life.</p>
        <p>Despite these challenges, and his recent departure from the United States Senate race, the mayor said yesterday that he was having a ''great birthday.''</p>
        <p>''Birthdays are terrific,'' the mayor said to reporters, shortly after a crowd of about 150 people sang for him. ''It gives you a chance to reflect on how lucky you are, how fortunate you are. I am a very, very fortunate man.''</p>
