        <p>''There's a lot of lexical ambiguity out there,'' Carrie Brownstein said with a smirk during Sleater-Kinney's show last Monday night at Irving Plaza. ''Just be aware of it.''</p>
        <p>This wasn't typical rock 'n' roll stage patter, but in its bookish way it defined the trio's enterprise. In songs whose elements coiled together like the strands of an electrical wire, Sleater-Kinney confronted the slipperiness of definitions and of the convictions that arise from them.</p>
        <p>Steadfast feminists who emerged five years ago to become the standard-bearers for socially conscious rock, the members of Sleater-Kinney are now veterans surveying a dirty battlefield. ''Now who would have believed this riot grrrl's a cynic?'' Corin Tucker sang in ''No. 1 Must Have,'' from the group's new album, ''All Hands on the Bad One'' (Kill Rock Stars).</p>
        <p>Her admission fit into a song cycle that wrestles with the assaults against women at last year's Woodstock Festival, mainstream rock's renewed machismo and Sleater-Kinney's own struggle to remain true to a vision its critics call didactic. ''They hand you the world's smallest microphone,'' sneered Ms. Brownstein in ''The Professional.'' ''It's still too loud, and you're asked to go home.''</p>
        <p>Such incongruities only feed Sleater-Kinney's music. Entanglement is the fundamental theme. Last Monday Ms. Brownstein's roving guitar parts hooked into Ms. Tucker's elastic vocal leads, as Ms. Tucker's nervous strumming spurred on Ms. Brownstein's more conversational singing. The drummer, Janet Weiss, kept the commotion in check, but the sound was always on the verge: of breakthrough or collapse, no one could tell.</p>
        <p>The songs made equal room for Ms. Tucker's hair-raising wail (which she traced back to Grace Slick in the group's version of the Jefferson Airplane's ''White Rabbit''), Ms. Brownstein's inventive guitar breaks and Ms. Weiss's mighty percussion. In this nonhierarchical way, Sleater-Kinney challenged conventional pop song structure.</p>
        <p>It did so without being stern about it. ''All Hands on the Bad One'' tempers its politics with saucy humor and a renewed commitment to rock's liberating force. ''As the model breaks, take the stage!'' Ms. Tucker shouted in ''Male Model,'' the song that inspired Ms. Brownstein's comment about ambiguity. Music-making is the direct action that resolves these women's ideological questions.</p>
        <p>Sleater-Kinney applied its politics to its touring bill, and so two female-dominated groups joined the band at Irving Plaza. The Butchies, a lesbian trio, served up a melange of folksy crooning, 1970's rock riffs and punk beats. The Gossip, a mixed-sex band, got rowdy with an utterly enjoyable punk-blues set. Pundits may claim that brash female rockers are no longer fashionable, but they're still plenty of rock 'n' roll fun.</p>
