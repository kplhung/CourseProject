        <p>This week, the managers of the more than 200 television stations that are affiliated with CBS will attend their annual meeting with the network's top executives. It is to take place at the luxurious Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, but for the top CBS executives, this will be no holiday.</p>
        <p>Many CBS station managers are becoming impatient with the network's new morning program, ''Early Show,'' with Bryant Gumbel. At last year's meeting, they were told the program would prove to be a great ratings boon for them.</p>
        <p>But the show has actually done worse than the show that it replaced, ''This Morning,'' which was widely considered to be a half-hearted effort and did not have a star of Mr. Gumbel's caliber. ''Early Show,'' which is watched in an average 1.9 million homes, is down 22 percent from its predecessor's ratings.</p>
        <p>That has made for some very unhappy CBS station managers, who will make their feelings known when the meeting begins on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''There is a high level of disenchantment among stations with the progress of the program,'' said Robert G. Lee, president and general manager of WDBJ, the CBS affiliate in Roanoke, Va., who is also the treasury secretary of the affiliates advisory board.</p>
        <p>''It would be fair to say that patience is becoming thin.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee said that he is so unhappy with the show's performance, he would like to replace it with a local news program. But, he said, he is contractually obliged to continue carrying ''Early Show'' until 2002.</p>
        <p>Other station managers, while also displeased, were more temperate.</p>
        <p>Alan M. Bell, president of Freedom Broadcasting, which owns five CBS affiliated stations, said that while he has no plans to pull the show, he thinks the network has to do something, before viewers completely tune it out. ''What we have to do is get the show to work,'' he said. ''They know it and we know it: it doesn't.''</p>
        <p>Still, even executives at CBS admit that they would not force a station to hold onto the show if it is absolutely hurting its business. They say, however, that no one has formally discussed dropping the show.</p>
        <p>Of course, that is something that they want to avoid. So they are preparing to work hard at the conference to persuade the station managers to stand by ''Early Show'' and give it more time.</p>
        <p>Executives said they would argue that the program, which features Jane Clayson and Mr. Gumbel, is at least far better, qualitatively, than the one that it replaced and that its audience is bound to grow eventually. They also plan to announce some minor initiatives that they say will help it catch on with viewers.</p>
        <p>They said that they know there will probably be some serious hecklers in the crowd. That, however, is to be expected. As one TV executive who has spent plenty of time at affiliate conferences put it, ''At these events, it's like being tied to a tree and having the vulture come and pluck at your liver -- and that's in the best of times.''</p>
