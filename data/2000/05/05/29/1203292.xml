        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your May 25 front-page news article about teacher and student turnover notes some reasons for student turnover that are beyond the control of the schools.</p>
        <p>However, school systems countrywide can control one rule that increases turnover: the one requiring children to change to a new school when they move out of the district.</p>
        <p>Many schools insist on immediate transfer even when there are only a few weeks left in a school year and when parents would be happy to provide transportation to the familiar school. Children who move to a new home because of marital disruption frequently experience school changes at a time when they are least able to cope with it.</p>
        <p>Some of the characteristic alienation of many high school students may be traceable to the insensitivity of school districts to these issues.</p>
