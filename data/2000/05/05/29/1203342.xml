        <p>Something is afoot in Hanover. This country has built itself a 400-foot-long glass structure, called it ''Germany: Workshop of Ideas,'' and adorned it with 47 giant busts of great Germans that include one Jurgen Sparwasser, a soccer player, but not Goethe.</p>
        <p>The structure in question is Germany's pavilion at Expo 2000, the world's fair that opens on June 1. The absence of Goethe, eased out by the likes of Marlene Dietrich, is suggestive of an insistent national quest: to get people to think differently about Germany.</p>
        <p>True, the Berlin Love Parade (whose instigator, Dr. Motte, earns a bust) and a half-century of peace have already dented German stereotypes. But Nicholas Batten, an Expo spokesman, insisted: ''It is very important that we keep presenting a different face. We want to show we are not the bad Germans any more. We want to be unpredictable.''</p>
        <p>Predictions certainly look hazardous at the 370-acre Expo site on the southern outskirts of this modest north German city. With little time remaining until the opening, an air of disorder prevails. Distinctly un-German -- and perhaps that is the point.</p>
        <p>Many of the more than 170 national pavillions seem little more than half-finished and minor fiascos keep occurring, as when the sand recently air-freighted to Hanover in a jumbo jet by the United Arab Emirates was mistaken for garbage and removed.</p>
        <p>''The Expo grounds look chaotic at the moment,'' Wiebke Bruhns, an Expo official, conceded. ''But I am confident that 98 percent will be finished by the time we open. Even if that is not the case, it will not be a catastrophe. The Germans have a reputation for being perfectly ordered, but maybe that is not always true.''</p>
        <p>So, a freewheeling, free-spirited, good-luck-to-Goethe sort of Germany is preparing to greet millions of visitors -- 40 million, it hopes -- to the country's first world's fair since these gatherings started in 1851. The timing is awkward: many think the Internet has rendered the whole idea obsolete.</p>
        <p>For such on-line debunkers of Expo, the organizers have a line: these critics have embraced a globalizing technology at the expense of humanity. You can't eat the Internet, they say. You can't smell it; you can't drink it. And a world's fair should be ''a party, a feast, a great big easygoing get-together,'' in the words of Ms. Bruhns.</p>
        <p>The United States is not impressed. Indeed so underwhelmed is the world's superpower that -- with minimal tact -- it is snubbing the party in Chancellor Gerhard's Schroder's hometown.</p>
        <p>On the site long planned for an elaborate American ''Main Street'' exhibit, a Romanian pavilion is being hastily erected and a Big Wheel is planned.</p>
        <p>''We certainly tried and I personally put some time into trying to get something to happen,'' said John Kornblum, the American ambassador to Germany. ''But in the end, globalization did us in.''</p>
        <p>After what was widely viewed as the debacle of the Seville Expo in 1992, Congress passed a law saying no government money could be used for world's fairs. So William D. Rollnick, a New York businessman chosen as the United States commissioner for the Hanover fair, spent more than two years trying to raise money in the private sector for an American pavilion.</p>
        <p>His attempts ended in failure a few weeks ago -- much to the annoyance of German officials who see the decision as a further sign of the United States turning its back on the world since the cold war's end.</p>
        <p>A major reason for the decision is that many American corporations now see themselves as ''global players''; they do not wish to be associated with a national pavilion. So in the age of globalization, the country that has held world's fairs in New York, San Francisco and Chicago, among other cities, views an American pavilion as a waste of time, even poentially counterproductive for global movers and shakers.</p>
        <p>''This is a short-sighted, embarrassing and deeply disappointing attitude from the United States,'' said Friedbert Pfluger, a local politician who lobbied hard for an American presence. ''What message is being sent here to the rest of the world?''</p>
        <p>America will, however, be represented by some of its ''global players,'' including McDonald's, I.B.M. and Coca-Cola, corporations that have earned the title of ''Product Partners'' by contributing about $5 million each. The food and drinks and equipment of these companies will be much in evidence, with advertising tied to the Expo logo, but not under an American flag or roof.</p>
        <p>A brochure produced for Expo and designed to attract corporate support says. ''For companies, the park offers a wonderful and credible instrument for public marketing that will offer new ways to reach clients.''</p>
        <p>So is this just another theme park? It has the longest cable car in northern Europe, the biggest mosaic in the world (6 million pieces), the largest wooden roof over a building, and, in a partial revenge for Goethe, promises the longest-ever performance of an unabridged ''Faust'' (I and II) -- a mere 21 hours.</p>
        <p>But the organizers insist that bigness is not all. They point to the fact that this is the first Expo with a specific theme -- ''Humankind-Nature-Technology'' -- and that the common thread is precisely the need to find new balances between onrushing technology and human needs, soaring consumption and dwindling resources.</p>
        <p>Some of the responses are remarkable, including Japan's pavilion built almost entirely of recycled paper, Hungary's flower-like structure of wood, and a Dutch pavilion that superimposes different landscapes.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Finland best catches the tensions between -- but also the complementarity of -- technology and nature. It has produced a handsome ''wind-nest'' combining ecology-friendly energy sources and a high-tech display where Nokia cell phones serve as the bodies of birds and provide their ersatz ''birdsong.''</p>
        <p>For the first time, too, an Expo will have a series of pavilions that are not national but dedicated to issues. Rajeev Sethi of India is orchestrating a ''Basic Needs'' pavilion. He has assembled a wide array of exhibits from artisans throughout the world, as well as an intriguing creation by a British artist called ''From Muck to Gold'' that illustrates the potential uses of human excrement.</p>
        <p>''I want to ask questions,'' Mr. Sethi said. ''What is need, and what greed? What is livelihood? I feel America is disconnected from such issues. It is a land of excess. We are always crying over whales and tigers, but basic human skills are also a dwindling resource. Technology, yes, O.K., but let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater.''</p>
        <p>On such debates, at Hanover at least, the United States has turned its back. As for Germany, well, anything goes.</p>
