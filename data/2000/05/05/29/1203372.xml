        <p>ON a lazy Sunday afternoon in New York, a few Indiana Pacers trickled into Madison Square Garden yesterday for a light shoot-around. Larry Bird had called in the team to watch film but had given his players a day off from practice.</p>
        <p>With a crucial Game 4 against the Knicks coming up today and a difficult loss in Game 3 to digest, Bird figured a day of relaxation and contemplation in New York would serve his team well.</p>
        <p>Dale Davis sat in a chair on the sideline surrounded by the news media. Rik Smits, who played an unaccustomed 40 minutes on Saturday -- and looked it -- draped himself over a couple of chairs. Mark Jackson filed out to the floor and held court, then Reggie Miller sat down under a basket.</p>
        <p>Game 3, and the Knicks' 98-95 victory, was hashed and rehashed.</p>
        <p>Sam Perkins, the Pacers' 38-year-old sage, sat on a table and lamented Saturday's loss. ''Yesterday's game was a winnable game,'' he said. ''We only led by 1 point at intermission but we played well, we showed them that we could play well, we could beat them here, and 3-0 sounds a lot better than 2-1. You have to finish a team like this when you get the chance because you know how the Knicks are.''</p>
        <p>Asked what he meant, Perkins smiled. ''Anything can happen in this building,'' he said. ''Yesterday Spree is shooting a shot that has no chance of going in, they call a foul on Reggie that bails him out. Last year you had the 4-point play. And just all the other stuff.''</p>
        <p>Off by center court Bird, the Pacers' coach and, as it turns out, their most consistent money player, held court.</p>
        <p>In all the analysis of the game, Bird picked up on something that only a bird might truly see. From a height and a distance, with a panoramic vantage point, he talked about an opportunity lost in a crucial Game 3, with Indiana leading the series by two games to none. Patrick Ewing was injured, in street clothes, Marcus Camby slipped on the court and fell and was eventually wheeled out of the Garden.</p>
        <p>Bird watched his team disintegrate. Poor shots, sloppy passes, bad calls exaggerated by Miller's chirping at the officials. But this was not what Bird picked up on yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Pacers missed a subtle signal on Saturday that the Knicks were out of emotional steam. Some Pacers were too young to pick it up. A veteran like Smits was too old to do anything about it, a player like Miller was too self-absorbed to notice. Bird was not talking about a missed shot  or a bad pass, a loose ball the Pacers did not grab. Bird was referring to the Knicks' crowd. The fans. They were gone.</p>
        <p>At a critical point in the game, Bird felt an odd stillness fall over the Garden. He thought back on all the games he had played in this building as a Celtic, going back to 1979. He had never felt this before. Not from the never-say-die Knicks fans. The spirit was gone. The energy that usually leads a Knicks rally, the electricity that shoots through the corridors and up to the rafters. Gone.  ''I've never heard a Garden crowd as soft as this one was yesterday,'' Bird said.</p>
        <p>For someone like Bird, a basketball artist who prided himself on precision when he played, the choice of words was revealing.</p>
        <p>He did not say the Garden was flat. He did not say the crowd was quiet. Or worried or drained of hope.</p>
        <p>Bird referred to the Knicks crowd as he might refer to an opposing center he planned to attack. He said the Garden crowd was soft. He thought  the Pacers could make their comeback and get away without having to tear through the emotional concentration of Knicks fans in the Garden.</p>
        <p>''We had a great opportunity,'' Bird said. ''It was so important to get that game yesterday. Now we play them again and it's going to be a battle.''</p>
        <p>The Madison Square Garden crowd may have fallen silent with Camby's loss, but Indiana faded along with them. ''That's been our three-year pattern,'' Bird said. ''We play well with our backs against the wall when things aren't going well, but when things are going well, we can't close it out.''</p>
        <p>Now Sprewell comes down with a foot injury.</p>
        <p>Jalen Rose walked out of the building yesterday afternoon when someone asked how he felt a loss would affect the Pacers. His face tightened.</p>
        <p>''We're not going to lose this series,'' he said. ''I don't care what anyone says. We're going to win this series.''</p>
        <p>The coach was not so sure. ''It's not about X's and O's at this point,'' Bird said. ''It's a matter of showing up and playing.''</p>
        <p>Bird joked about the Garden crowd and said he hoped the spirit would somehow stay away today. He  realized the Pacers had a one-game pass and had blown it. Another missed opportunity.</p>
        <p>''I never heard the Garden so soft before,'' Bird said. ''I guarantee you, I'll never hear it again.''</p>
