        <p>A specter is stalking the Internet: the specter of the Web stalker.</p>
        <p>It can be a credit card issuer letting merchants of porn in on your buying habits or confiding your travel plans or medication purchases to private investigators.

        <p>A specter is stalking the Internet: the specter of the Web stalker.</p>
        <p>It can be a credit card issuer letting merchants of porn in on your buying habits or confiding your travel plans or medication purchases to private investigators. It can be a thief using your Social Security number to steal your identity and ruin your credit. It can even be a criminal searching the Web for your photograph, as has happened with tragic consequences.</p>
        <p>Not to worry, says an industry busily compiling dossiers on every American. Leave it to us to police ourselves. Someday -- after we have your personal history going back to grades in grammar school -- we'll get around to restraining our intrusiveness.</p>
        <p>Last week, after listening to false promises for five years, a majority of the Federal Trade Commission -- Republicans dissenting -- roused itself to suggest a law providing Americans the rudiments of privacy protection.</p>
        <p>The F.T.C. report revealed that fewer than 1 in 10 Internet sites that collect personal identifying data display the industry's voluntary privacy seal. ''Self-regulation'' promised by the mushrooming companies is a farce because they salivate at the heavy money to be made in shadowing the users of computers, snooping into their private lives.</p>
        <p>Robert Pitofsky, the F.T.C. chairman, told Senate Commerce that Web sites should be required by law to tell users in clear language what information they collect (often surreptitiously, through ''cookies'' implanted in computers to track your movements), and to whom they sell or trade your personal data.</p>
        <p>Such disclosure is long overdue; legal gobbledygook that passes for privacy policy conceals by confusing. Pitofsky also recommends that netties be given the right to see what's been collected about them, just as consumers already have the right to read and correct inaccuracies in their credit reports.</p>
        <p>So far so good, although the pro-snooping lobby protests that this is much too onerous and would slow the e-commerce boom. But then the F.T.C. flinched from its responsibility to consumers: it suggested merely that Web sites be obligated to offer consumers ''the choice'' of saying no to profiling.</p>
        <p>Sounds protective, but Web stalkers know that baby step to be a sham. Marketers call it ''opt out''; it puts the burden of protecting privacy on the consumer. Most people have neither the time, know-how or gumption to examine closely the uses to which their data will be put; they are unlikely to take the initiative to direct dozens of Web sites to not shadow and share.</p>
        <p>''Opt out'' is the marketer's public relations trick to provide the pretense of choice. That was the sellout that Senate Banking chairman Phil Gramm and Treasury Secretary Larry Summers engineered, at the banking lobby's urging, to let banks get away with new intrusions into depositors' financial privacy. We will have to wait until Senator Richard Shelby, the G.O.P.'s privacy champion, becomes Banking Committee chairman before that is changed to ''opt in.''</p>
        <p>The only genuine online privacy protection is informed, written consent. That is when the burden of getting permission to pass around personal data falls where it belongs, on the seller, who must explain the deal and persuade or offer inducements to the buyer to choose to give permission.</p>
        <p>Real privacy depends on who is required to do the asking. An online privacy policy that fails to conclude with ''now that you know exactly what we will do with your information, do you give your consent?'' is a phony privacy policy.</p>
        <p>At Senate Commerce last week, Democrats Jay Rockefeller and Fritz Hollings offered a bill to require Web sites to ask such consent. Chairman John McCain, in obeisance to evenhandedness, will offer online hardliners further hearings next week to promise the voluntary moon.</p>
        <p>''We would be taking on the most influential lobby in Washington today,'' McCain tells me. He thinks the Rockefeller-Hollings approach may be ''too encroaching'' on industry. Will he at least move the F.T.C.'s watered-down recommendations? ''I'll introduce a bill and we'll mark it up. But the way the Senate is being run these days, it may never come to a floor vote. In my 14 years here, I've never seen less done.''</p>
        <p>E-commercites: Until the online stalking and profiling is stopped, go to a store and pay cash.</p>
