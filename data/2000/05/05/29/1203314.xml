        <p>BIOGRAPHY OF A GERM  By Arno Karlen  178 pages. Pantheon. $22.</p>
        <p>Gaia is a term invented around 1950 by an English theorist, James Lovelock, suggesting a kind of ultimate ecological connectedness, the idea that living things are so interlocked in function that all of them, from microbes to elephants, are part of a single immense organism.</p>
        <p>In his informative and clever little book, ''Biography of a Germ,'' Arno Karlen, a psychoanalyst who has written other books on biology and medical history, rejects the more fuzzily spiritual concepts of gaia. He does not see the entire biosphere as ''one big pulsating organism.'' Still his description of the life of a single microscopic organism does bring into focus the interrelatedness of living things, in this instance of white mice, deer, ticks, the microbe Borrelia burgdorferi and the man-made condition of various flora.</p>
        <p>The germ in question, which is at the center of Mr. Karlen's book, causes Lyme disease, and that has made it an object of considerable interest in the last couple of decades.  Borrelia burgdorferi, known as Bb, was discovered only in 1982, not long after Lyme disease was identified, but it has been on the planet, living in nonhuman organisms, since before there were human organisms, and it will probably still be here after the humans are gone. That is one reason, Mr. Karlen says, that this germ is a good subject for a ''biography,'' as good in its way as a conventional biography of some influential human figure.</p>
        <p>''Life stories of animals and insects, like biographies of people, have a purpose,'' Mr. Karlen writes. ''They illuminate the community of life, showing what makes species different and what unites them. They show that by knowing any creature, one better understands the living web in which it, and we, are threads.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Karlen almost overdoes this point, prefacing his plunge into the germ itself with a good deal of throat-clearing, edging over from the clever to the adorable here and there and straining a bit too much both for literary effect and ecological enlightenment. The interrelatedness of things has been drummed into us enough these days, and Mr. Karlen's reiteration belabors the principle. But when he gets to Bb itself, Mr. Karlen's book becomes informative and entertaining at the same time, a fine piece of popular science writing that covers the biological basics for those who do not know them but covers them stylishly enough for the more informed to gain insight, too.</p>
        <p>The stress is on the biological diversity of microbes, such that ''Bb and the bacilli in sour milk differ from each other more than hummingbirds and eagles do,'' and the slyness of genetic adaptation. Along the way Mr. Karlen summarizes matters like the Linnaean system of classification, the 17th-century discovery of microbes and the various types and sizes of microscopic creatures.</p>
        <p>Bb is a spirochete, one of the three main shapes of bacteria; it is a long, slender spiral similar in some ways to the organism that causes syphilis.  It takes what Mr. Karlen calls a fantastic voyage to get into the human bloodstream, a voyage that provokes a fair degree of wonderment  about the complexity of things and about their unpredictability.</p>
        <p>Mr. Karlen clearly enjoys the irony that Bb in recent years invaded human beings, not as the result of our doing ''bad'' things like despoiling the environment or pushing other species into extinction but by doing such ''good'' things as protecting the natural world.</p>
        <p>The peregrinations of Bb take it from ticks to white-footed mice, which are warm-blooded, and back into the gut of a tick, which is, as Mr. Karlen graphically puts this, like being cast ''in one moment from a hot tub to a meat locker.'' He explains succinctly how the microbe manages to survive this shock and also to survive the intense invisible battle that all microbes must fight with the varied arsenals of their hosts' immune systems, the attacks of white blood cells, T cells and antibodies. Bb fights this battle continuously as it moves from its second tick to another warm-blooded animal, possibly a raccoon or a rabbit, then back to a tick, which then must pass a critical stage of its life cycle on a deer before infecting a human being.</p>
        <p>As he recounts Bb's life history, Mr. Karlen along the way addresses interesting questions like whether ticks themselves get sick from Bb, and if not, why not. He gives a brief history of the emergence of Lyme disease in Lyme, Conn., in the late 1970's, which is itself a fascinating story, and then the discovery of Bb by a Swiss biologist named Willy Burgdorfer, working in a lab in Montana.</p>
        <p>A critical part of the story was the long-term transformation of the landscape of the American Northeast, from forest to farm and then, in furtherance of the conservation movement, back to semi-forest again. The invasion of human beings by Bb, which depended on the reintroduction of deer into the habitat without the introduction of the deer's erstwhile natural enemies, was the unintended consequence.</p>
        <p>''Lyme disease could not have become epidemic until a changing ecosystem revived Bb and its hosts, and suburbanization thrust people into their midst,'' Mr. Karlen writes. He adds that the case of Lyme disease is not the only one in which humans have unwittingly placed themselves at the intersection of microbes and other animals. He provides the additional example of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, which became epidemic when insecticides ingested by lizards ended up killing the cats (which ate the lizards) that were the only natural enemy of the mice that bore the disease.</p>
        <p>Mr. Karlen closes with some facts and questions concerning Lyme disease itself, reassuring us that for most of us our immune systems take care of Bb's invasion without outside intervention, most commonly antibiotics. Indeed, there is a sharp debate among specialists about the usefulness of antibiotics, which some doctors feel are both unnecessary and likely to lead to more resistant Bb strains.</p>
        <p>Mr. Karlen handles his subject with wit and comprehensiveness. His book will help you know where you are going the next time you take a little walk in some pleasant meadow.</p>
