        <p>For years, advertisers and agencies seeking to reach the elusive male consumer had an inside joke: The only magazine most men read regularly was TV Guide.</p>
        <p>Yes, there were many publications aimed at men -- among them, Esquire, GQ and Playboy. But Madison Avenue considered television, particularly sports programming, the more efficient way to peddle products like cars, beer, fast food and sneakers.</p>
        <p>Men, especially in the category of free-spenders ages 18 to 34, were perceived to have a predilection for video over print. And the fabled limited male attention span was deemed ill-suited to magazine advertising, which takes more time to accumulate those all-important ''impressions,'' compared with the immediacy of TV.</p>
        <p>''The marketplace didn't indicate a broad interest in men's magazines,'' said Ellen Oppenheim, media director at the New York office of FCB Worldwide, an agency owned by True North Communications.</p>
        <p>Also, the sheer size of the male audience watching televised coverage of golf, tennis and professional team  sports made it simpler to reach men by buying commercial time on those shows. For instance, the average male viewership of one ''Monday Night Football'' game on ABC last season was about 12.8 million. That is only 400,000 less than the combined circulations of nine leading magazines with predominantly male readerships, including Sports Illustrated.</p>
        <p>Now, though, magazine publishers are battling back. They are aggressively trying to entice the agency executives who decide where to spend billions of advertising dollars to divert more money to print from television, or to at least earmark additional dollars for magazine ads.</p>
        <p>Aside from major sporting events, ''you don't see a lot of men at home sitting in front of the tube,'' said Valerie Salembier, vice president and publisher at Esquire in New York, part of Hearst Magazines. ''I asked a 26-year-old if he watches 'The Practice,' '' she added, ''and he said 'When is it on?' ''</p>
        <p>Publishers like Ms. Salembier are trying to persuade Madison Avenue that men's magazines offer real alternatives to programs aimed at men on broadcast and cable television -- particularly as the cost of TV commercials climbs to record levels for the 2000-2001 season.</p>
        <p>''With television, there's more demand than supply, so you go to them,'' said Steve Sturm, vice president for marketing at the Toyota division of Toyota Motor Sales USA in Torrance, Calif. ''With print, we can choose from 300 publications, so they come to you.''</p>
        <p>Among the newer choices are magazines like FHM and Maxim, with the personalities of fraternity brothers; Gear and Stuff, offering advice on buying gizmos and gadgets; Cigar Aficionado, Dads and Men's Health, with life style focuses; and ESPN, Maximum Golf and Men's Journal, for men who are armchair (or actual) athletes.</p>
        <p>''You see men embracing magazines more,'' said Melissa Pordy, senior vice president and print services director at Zenith Media in New York, a joint venture of the Cordiant Communications Group and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi that buys ad space and commercial time for major marketers.</p>
        <p>''Everybody wants TV because of its reach,'' Ms. Pordy said. ''But print has a strong story to tell.''</p>
        <p>That story is amplified when the newcomers are considered alongside established magazines with large male readerships. Among those are special-interest publications covering subjects like business, cars, fishing, hunting, music and sports; the mainstays like Esquire, GQ, Outside, Penthouse and Playboy; and even magazines read by gay men like The Advocate, Genre and Out.</p>
        <p>Also of potential appeal to advertisers is a spate of magazines intended for teenage boys, a coveted demographic group because they are typically still forming their brand preferences. The magazines are meant to provide articles on life style, entertainment, fashion and service topics the same way that Seventeen and YM do for teenage girls. One, already introduced, is Transworld Stance, a joint venture of Transworld Media, the publisher of Skateboarding, and Times Mirror Magazines. A second, due in September from Rodale, the publisher of Men's Health, is called MH-18.</p>
        <p>With all those options, magazines seem to be mounting a battle against television bellicose enough for that male TV favorite, ''W.W.F. Smackdown.'' But in competing for ad dollars, print still faces a struggle.</p>
        <p>''Let's not give up wrestling so fast,'' Alan Jurmain said with a chuckle. Mr. Jurmain is executive vice president and managing director for United States media services at Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide in New York, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
        <p>He and his media decision-making counterparts at other agencies described some doubts that magazines must overcome to turn the tide against TV.</p>
        <p>''You've got to question how broad an interest men's fashion is,'' Mr. Jurmain said, noting the subject that predominates among the articles in many men's magazines.</p>
        <p>More troubling, he added, are worries about the ''environment'' of some popular publications. He was using a shorthand term for editorial formulas that deliver large doses of articles celebrating hedonistic behavior and photographs of scantily clad women.</p>
        <p>''We have one client who has been uncomfortable with at least one men's magazine'' because of problematic content, said Dan Binder, vice president and director for print investment at Starcom Worldwide in Chicago, a media services agency owned by the B Com3  Group.</p>
        <p>''So we've taken special steps with the publication to ensure our ads are as far away from certain types of editorial as they can be,'' Mr. Binder said, ''with the option to move out of issues if there's no way to separate us.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes even those precautions are not sufficient. Fragrance brands carrying the Ralph Lauren name, for instance, are not being advertised in Maxim or Playboy magazines, said Jack Wiswall, senior vice president and general manager for the designer fragrance division of Cosmair in New York, the unit of L'Oreal responsible for those scents.</p>
        <p>''We just can't get settled on that particular pictorial,'' Mr. Wiswall said. ''It's not a venue we choose.'' Maxim is, however, on the media schedule for two of his other fragrance brands, Acqua di Gio and Emporio Armani for Him.</p>
        <p>Lance Ford, group publisher for Maxim and Stuff magazines at Dennis Maxim Inc. in New York, concedes that some advertisers remain reluctant. ''I think we can carry the bulk of categories that advertise in men's life style magazines, but some will take longer than others to come in,'' Mr. Ford said.</p>
        <p>''There was resistance in the beginning, no doubt about it,'' he added, particularly among marketers of products aimed at more affluent men, ''and I would think there is still some work to do.''</p>
        <p>Content, of course, is also an issue when agencies buy commercial time on TV. But the widespread availability of sports programming ameliorates those difficulties.</p>
        <p>Another challenge for magazines is the mortality rate among newer publications that were promoted to advertisers as guaranteed to attract younger male consumers.</p>
        <p>''We need to proceed with some caution,'' said Bobbi Silten, president for the Dockers and Slates United States unit of Levi Strauss &amp; Company in San Francisco. ''Not every magazine being launched will be a hit.''</p>
        <p>In fact, there is a lengthening list of titles being closed. Among them are Bikini, Blaze, Icon and P.O.V. And in March, Advance Publications suddenly stopped publishing Details, which is to return in October after a revamping.</p>
        <p>''There's something about a new magazine that advertisers find exciting,'' said Roberta Garfinkle, senior vice president and print media director at McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York. ''But you want the magazine to last for more than the launch.'' Her agency is part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group.</p>
        <p>''There is going to be some shakeout,'' predicted Thomas A. Florio, vice president and publisher of a venerable men's magazine, GQ, part of the Conde Nast Publications unit of Advance. ''I liken it to the Nasdaq,'' he added, laughing.</p>
        <p>Then, turning serious, Mr. Florio continued: ''Think about how successful the Internet is with men. They're getting information and entertainment by reading. That's good for men's magazines.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, according to Mr. Sturm of Toyota, pitting magazines and television against each other is so 20th-century -- such an old-media way to look at things.</p>
        <p>These days, Toyota spends about a quarter of its print ad budget on magazines read by men and about a third of its TV ad budget on programs watched by men. But online media have also become an increasingly important factor. ''You actually have a bridge now between television and print: the Internet,'' Mr. Sturm said. ''Fifty percent of my interactive plan is targeted to men.''</p>
        <p>''With the Web,'' he said, ''you can get the two-dimensional detail of print and the three-dimensional feel of television without having to spend three-dimensional dollars.''</p>
