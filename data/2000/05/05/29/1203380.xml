        <p>Van Chancellor always found it difficult to root for the Yankees. Not because he grew up in Mississippi, but because they spoiled the fun. ''I always pulled against them because they won so much,'' Chancellor said frankly in his Southern drawl.</p>
        <p>Now Chancellor can understand the trappings of such a dynasty, the predicament of privilege. If his Houston Comets are not the Yankees, they are the Chicago Bulls and the Dallas Cowboys of the Women's National Basketball Association. In its three years of existence, the W.N.B.A. has only known one champion.</p>
        <p>''I think it's good for the league,'' Chancellor said. ''Comets basketball has brought notoriety to the league.''</p>
        <p>Houston won when there were only eight teams in the league's inaugural season. And then when there were 10. And last year, the Comets were the best of 12.</p>
        <p>This season, the W.N.B.A. has expanded to 16 teams, a significant burst that could dilute the talent pool yet by the end of the season simply prove the theory of continuity.</p>
        <p>Houston's Cynthia Cooper, the league's two-time most valuable player, the All-Star forward Sheryl Swoopes and center Tina Thompson form an unbendable triangle. Chancellor, the three-time W.N.B.A. coach of the year, is the elixir for the team's potent, but potentially unstable, chemistry.</p>
        <p>Because of those four, the Comets are once again favored to capture the championship, a quest that begins today when they tip off the W.N.B.A. season in Houston against the Liberty, the team the Comets defeated for titles No. 1 and No. 3.</p>
        <p>Chancellor, doing his best Joe Torre imitation, said: ''Everyone always asks me if there is a lot of pressure. We don't think about four-peating -- we try to give our best.''</p>
        <p>The other teams have no choice but to credit Houston, for now. ''I personally don't mind it -- they are setting the standard,'' said Brian Agler, the Minnesota Lynx coach and general manager, who coached the only champion of the short-lived American Basketball League, the Columbus Quest, to two titles. ''It makes everybody better when we have someone to shoot for. We have to find a way to catch up.''</p>
        <p>The Comets represent consistency, the best tonic for a league that, as a result of last year's sticky labor negotiations with the players' union, might be expanding too soon, too fast.</p>
        <p>In a year when four new franchises -- Portland, Seattle, Indiana and Miami -- join the league, executives are hoping to establish some brand recognition. For the first time, the W.N.B.A. did not coin a new catch phrase like ''We Got Next'' or ''Join In,'' deciding instead to recycle ''We Got Game.''</p>
        <p>''We want to build a little of equity, creating something longer lasting than every season,'' said Val Ackerman, the W.N.B.A. president.</p>
        <p>Attendance last season was down (by about 100 a game) from the second season, averaging 10,704. But, as league officials are quick to point out, attendance had far exceeded projections (albeit deliberately set low) the first season. Success, however, has increased expectations.</p>
        <p>Whereas last season the league drew a total of 1,959,733 in 32 regular-season games, Ackerman said that this season the W.N.B.A. is hoping to draw 2.5 million fans from the 16 teams in a 32-game season. She projects 3 million in the fifth season.</p>
        <p>The three networks NBC, ESPN and Lifetime are in the fourth year of a five-year deal. And the W.N.B.A. is in the process of re-signing major sponsors, most of whom began with three-year packages. Television ratings held steady at NBC last season and increased marginally on cable.</p>
        <p>The average minimum salaries have increased slightly, though the average base salary for the league is still just below $36,000 for the three-month season.</p>
        <p>The W.N.B.A. is not yet turning a profit, Ackerman insisted, but it could be close within the next two years. ''Right now we are ahead of schedule,'' she said, ''with the early success and the surge of interest.''</p>
        <p>More than a league ideal, ''We Got Game'' could simply be the plea from the other would-be champions, a group of franchises that is expanding, especially in the Western Conference, and gunning for Houston.</p>
        <p>Houston has never been strong at point guard, still coping with the death of Kim Perot last August and then losing Sonja Henning in the expansion draft. The center position is also a concern.</p>
        <p>''They are still the team to beat, but I think we're capable,'' said Sacramento Monarchs Coach Sonny Allen, whose team is considered the most likely to dethrone the Comets.  Sacramento has no visible weakness. The Monarchs return five core players from a team that finished 19-13 in 1999 and which had the league's most valuable player, forward Yolanda Griffith. Griffith, a former M.V.P. with the A.B.L., was second in the league in scoring last season, averaging 18 points and 11.3 rebounds a game. Sacramento lost only the reserve guard Kate Starbird to the expansion draft.</p>
        <p>Sacramento now has the league's most explosive offense, as point guard Ticha Penicheiro dazzles with no-look passes and the sharpshooting Olympian Ruthie Bolton-Holifield is finally healthy.</p>
        <p>If the Monarchs represent the run-and-gun style common in the West, then the Liberty best characterizes the Eastern Conference. But the Liberty is burdened by the knee injury to Rebecca Lobo and is waiting for last year's star rookie, Tamika Whitmore, to get in shape.</p>
        <p>The East is aging, as well as plagued with injuries from Washington to Charlotte to Cleveland.</p>
        <p>Still, four teams from each conference will make the W.N.B.A.'s expanded playoffs this season, vying for a chance to dethrone Houston. The regular-season opener has been moved up two weeks and the league finishes on Aug. 9 to accommodate training for the Sydney Olympics. The playoffs will consist of three  rounds of two-of-three-game series this season, with no byes.</p>
        <p>Will it be Houston again? ''People are dying to see if they can do it again, and if they do, it is going to be worth talking about,'' Washington Coach Nancy Darsch said. ''If there had been three different teams then it wouldn't have been as emotional or as big a deal as it is to knock off the three-time champion.''</p>
