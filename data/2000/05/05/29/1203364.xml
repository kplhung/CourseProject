        <p>Two men robbed an electronics store yesterday across the street from the Wendy's restaurant where five people were killed in a robbery four days earlier, the police said.</p>
        <p>The men, armed with a black semiautomatic handgun, walked into The Wiz electronics store on Main Street in Flushing, Queens, at 1:22 p.m. and went to a back office where two managers were counting money, the investigators said.</p>
        <p>The men ''removed $18,000 to $20,000 from the safe, which was still open,'' said Sgt. Elias Nikas, a police spokesman. The men walked out with the money, and no one was hurt in the incident, the police said.</p>
        <p>The robbery alarmed merchants in the neighborhood. On Wednesday, five Wendy's workers were fatally shot and two others were wounded in a robbery. The police have charged Craig Godineaux, 30, and John B. Taylor, 36, a parolee who had worked at the fast-food restaurant, with murder and robbery.</p>
        <p>In both cases, officials said, the robbers seemed to be familiar with the stores, and in both, the robbers bound store employees with duct tape after packing up the money, officials said.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Nikas declined to say whether the suspects in yesterday's robbery had been identified.</p>
