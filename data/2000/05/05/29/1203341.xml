        <p>The rolling farmland that unfolds in all directions from here is so famous for its rich, black soil that the Germans carted a lot of it home during World War II. This was also the battlefield on which Peter the Great stunned Europe's monarchs by defeating the fabled Swedish war machine of Charles XII.</p>
        <p>And today, a burly agronomist with a Cossack's mustache is gaining a reputation for doing what many Communist overlords of agriculture repeatedly failed to do in the 20th century -- he is making money farming this land.</p>
        <p>Across a landscape of convulsing and collapsing communes that are the most prominent feature of post-Soviet agriculture, a small number of entrepreneurial private farmers, like Vasily T. Sluga, are using new land reforms in Ukraine to show others the way.</p>
        <p>Their success is by no means assured in a country the size of France whose official economy has contracted by half in a decade, whose population is producing less food and importing more and whose unofficial -- or underground -- economy is impossible to measure or predict. Just to borrow money for seeds and diesel fuel, Mr. Sluga must entice credit from local oligarchs.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Sluga says there are dozens, if not hundreds, of new entrepreneurial farmers like him in central Ukraine. In the capital, Kiev, Western officials say that anecdotal data is trickling in to suggest that private agriculture is developing, if not yet flourishing, on the fertile land that was once the granary of the Russian empire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sluga, 43, has no special business training for the life he is carving out for himself in the wreckage of 70 years of Soviet collectivization. He receives no grants from Western tycoons or advice from Western experts. But nearly a decade ago, he realized that Ukraine's communes were doomed and would not survive the transition from Communism, and he undertook a self-reliant course to build a private farming business with brawn and wit.</p>
        <p>''Life forces us to find ways,'' he said in an interview in his small brick home in the village of Chutovo, about 30 miles east of here. ''Under the conditions of agriculture today, no one is left to give orders from above and so everything depends on the individual farmer,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sluga began to run things himself in April 1993 after the first tentative land reforms in Ukraine allocated five acres to each member of the country's farm collectives, the communes that already were swamped with debt and unable to pay wages and pensions on time, if at all.</p>
        <p>Today he has 1,730 acres under production, with 20 employees and a fleet of tractors, combines and a harvester, all of which he parks in the garage of the bankrupt Soviet Ukraine commune, whose leaders have been only too happy to sell off their equipment and buildings as Mr. Sluga needs them.</p>
        <p>The commune's best foreman, Nikolai V. Ogiyko, is now Mr. Sluga's foreman. ''People realize now that they work for themselves,'' said Mr. Ogiyko, ''that we are on our own.''</p>
        <p>And when Mr. Sluga bought the commune's harvester, he also recruited its 72-year-old driver, Ivan Nimchin, who remains an avowed Leninist, but who now contributes his legendary harvesting skills to Mr. Sluga's holdings.</p>
        <p>''I think the old system was better,'' said Mr. Nimchin, ''but it is nice to get a paycheck.''</p>
        <p>In 1993, Mr. Sluga pooled his five acres of land with the plots of five of his friends and together they planted 30 acres with sugar beets and potatoes. A second land reform decree that came down from Kiev that year ordered the communes to make up to 10 percent of their land available for private farmers. Again pooling his land with several friends, Mr. Sluga had more than 350 acres ready for planting by the end of 1993.</p>
        <p>''These lands that were given out were usually the worst lands on the commune, on the slopes or far away from the town, but we were lucky,'' said Mr. Sluga. ''The land we got was pretty good.''</p>
        <p>But they had no money for seeds or equipment, and thus borrowed some $10,000 from a regional farmers' organization at interest rates of more than 40 percent.</p>
        <p>Their farming venture might have ended right there, but for additional assistance from a now defunct government fund to support farmers, and deft management. With their loan, they bought a harvester, two new tractors, one second-hand tractor, fuel and seeds. They planted winter wheat that fall, and in the spring of 1994, barley, rye, corn, millet, sunflower seeds and sugar beets. With their first harvest they paid off their debts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sluga's business plan was relentlessly simple: eliminate overhead costs, hire employees with multiple skills, reinvest all profits in the business and handle negotiations and contracts himself. The farm's office is a closet-size room in Mr. Sluga's modest brick home. His wife raises chickens, rabbits and three pigs in a muddy courtyard strewn with farm equipment and guarded by a boisterous German shepherd.</p>
        <p>''My wife is angry at me because I have not finished my own house yet,'' he said. ''All our money goes to the business.''</p>
        <p>In his first year of farming, Ukraine's economy was in free fall, with hyperinflation that reached 10,000 percent. ''Everybody was surviving in his own way,'' Mr. Sluga said, ''and somehow we managed to stay afloat,'' by bartering crops for fuel and seeds.</p>
        <p>As he had learned in agricultural school, Mr. Sluga rotated his crops and invested his profits in herbicides and fertilizers at a time when the communes were cutting corners, scaling back and surrendering more and more acreage to weeds. As their yields and output declined, Mr. Sluga's increased.</p>
        <p>In 1994, after his first successful harvest, Mr. Sluga split with his four partners in a disagreement over how to invest their profits, but within two years, ''some of my former partners rented their land to me because they could not continue on their own.''</p>
        <p>Over the years Mr. Sluga's farm holdings stabilized at about 300 to 400 acres, and although he was making money, his profit margins were thin.</p>
        <p>But last December, after President Leonid Kuchma issued the most sweeping land reform decree to date, privatizing all communes, dividing the ownership of the land equally among the commune members and withdrawing state support, a whole new opportunity opened up for Mr. Sluga's April Farm enterprise, named for the month it was started.</p>
        <p>''The first thing that happened was that last winter, the Soviet Ukraine commune made a proposition for me to become their chairman,'' he said. ''They wanted me to take over because it was the worst commune in the whole district and one of the worst in the region, and they had seen that my farming business was very much in order.''</p>
        <p>The commune, with 3,700 acres of land and debt of $360,000, was headed for bankruptcy. So Mr. Sluga made a counterproposal. The commune could fend for itself, he said, but he would rent land from 120 members of the commune, more than 1,200 acres in all, and he would pay the rent to the owners with shares of his harvest.</p>
        <p>In this way, he would avoid becoming entangled in the commune's debts, and probably get all of the commune's lands and equipment within two years.</p>
        <p>The commune accepted his offer, in part because no one in the commune had been paid for five months. And Mr. Sluga tripled his holdings to more than 1,700 acres. He had suddenly become a very big farmer, in need of yet more capital in a cash-starved land.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sluga went to a newly rich oligarch and borrowed more than $10,000 to buy seeds, fuel and additional farming equipment.</p>
        <p>''I understand that I am running a very big risk in taking another loan, because if we don't receive a good harvest all that I have is not enough to repay this debt. So we have done everything we could and the rest depends on the weather. If we are lucky, it will rain.''</p>
