        <p>THE film industry loves the familiarity of sequels, so it won't spoil the ending of this column to reveal that the Web sites for this year's roster of potential summer box-office blockbusters are mostly formulaic rehashes of past sites.</p>
        <p>Last year, the site for ''The Blair Witch Project'' seemed to signal a turning point. By supplementing the movie's faux-documentary footage with additional online ''evidence,'' the filmmakers simultaneously built an audience for their low-budget flick and showed Hollywood's new-media mavens that a successful site didn't  have to be a bland bouillabaisse of canned production notes, fuzzy video clips and simple games.</p>
        <p>But a tour of the promotional sites for some recently released or soon-to-open movies often felt like ''Nightmare on HTML Street 5'' -- it might have been horrifying if we hadn't seen it all before.</p>
        <p>In fact, if memory serves, the sites for ''Mission: Impossible 2'' (www.missionimpossible .com) and ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' (www.nuttyprofessor.com) are remarkably similar to -- and just as routine as -- the ones developed for their cinematic antecedents in 1996.</p>
        <p>Producers who say their budgets are ''all on the screen'' don't mean the computer monitor. Given that Hollywood spends millions of dollars on spectacular computer-generated special effects to attract summer crowds, some of that digital creativity might be expected to trickle down to the Internet. But except for the widespread use of animated pages requiring the Flash software plug-in, the multimedia possibilities of the Internet seem to be lost on the industry's high-technology wizards.</p>
        <p>Only one site, for ''The Cell'' (www.thecell .com), a movie set for release in August, provides a compelling online experience. Instead of relying on film stills and video clips, the site conveys the grim thriller's sick but stylish sensibility through a series of elaborate, effectively creepy animations.</p>
        <p>These are augmented by a database of information on serial killers and an interactive psychology test that seeks to draw visitors into the film's story -- the tale of a psychologically disturbed killer who drowns his female victims before mutilating the bodies.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere among movie sites, this kind of immersed content is hard to find. In the past, sites for films like ''Twister'' and ''Contact'' supplied all sorts of topical information and scientific background designed to support their cinematic version of reality.</p>
        <p>One of the few current sites that take such pains is the one for ''The Perfect Storm'' (www.perfectstorm.com), which provides enough context that it might actually encourage online visitors to shut off their computers and head for the movie theater.</p>
        <p>The site is easy to navigate and overflowing with multimedia features, including home video clips of the northeaster that walloped Gloucester, Mass., in 1991 and supplies the drama for the film's story. There also is a 14-minute documentary on residents who survived the real storm, as well as a series of video clips about the film's special effects.</p>
        <p>So the site for Disney's ''Dinosaur'' (http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/dinosaur) should be swamped with Mesozoic material, right? Strangely, no. The skimpy site highlights the digital cartoon's scaly characters and supplies a few rudimentary examples of animation, but it stomps on an opportunity to educate young visitors about the pleasures of paleontology.</p>
        <p>The Web site for ''The Patriot'' (www .thepatriot.com) is all too typical of the genre, with biographies of the cast and crew, a copy of the trailer and a bunch of photos and drawings.</p>
        <p>A Revolutionary War chronology is short on historical detail and pointlessly interactive. And the loopiest element is a discussion area that implies that Internet taxation might be a revolutionary cause, though it is unlikely that people will start tossing their personal computers into Boston Harbor anytime soon.</p>
        <p>Even more meandering is the ''Gladiator'' (http://gladiator-thefilm.com) site. Its circular interface -- meant no doubt to resemble the Coliseum in Rome -- was a constant battle to navigate. And to access special areas of the site, visitors must first traverse it and collect 40 different ''virtues,'' including ''changability'' and ''deceipt'' (but not ''spelling'').</p>
        <p>One final note: The ''Mission: Impossible 2'' site requires visitors to submit e-mail addresses to enter certain areas, but registrants then receive unsolicited promotional messages. Perhaps the plot of ''Mission: Impossible 3'' will be about the worldwide effort to end spam.</p>
