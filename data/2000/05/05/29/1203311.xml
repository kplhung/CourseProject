        <p>When rumors circulated last month that the American company StarMedia Network might be acquired by Terra Networks, the Internet industry found the story plausible.</p>
        <p>After all, StarMedia, based in New York, had one of last year's hot Internet stock offerings but had seen its shares fall precipitously. And its Web portal, which since 1996 had been the premier gateway to material on the Internet in Spanish and Portuguese, was facing increased competition in Latin America.</p>
        <p>The pressure has come from both local and international multimedia giants -- like Terra, which is owned by Spain's largest telecommunications company, Telefonica. Terra, in fact, had already bought up a handful of Internet service providers in Latin America to challenge StarMedia as the region's biggest player.</p>
        <p>But Terra was weak on content -- the news, information and entertainment that is StarMedia's specialty. So on the face of it, a deal made sense even if StarMedia continued to insist that it was holding no talks with Terra.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, StarMedia's denials were genuine. Two weeks ago, Terra did make a content play -- a $12.5 billion deal to buy Lycos, an American Web portal with international reach. So now, rather than having a partner, StarMedia must contemplate an even bigger, more powerful rival in the Latin American Internet market.</p>
        <p>StarMedia's charismatic 33-year-old founder and chief executive, Fernando J. Espuelas, is not one to voice anxiety, though. In Sao Paulo recently for the introduction of the company's redesigned portal, StarMedia 6.0, he brushed off worries of growing competition in Latin America.</p>
        <p>''It is our leadership to lose, and we are not going to lose it,'' said Mr. Espuelas, a native of Uruguay. ''Not because we are preordained to win, because nobody is. But we move very fast. We know this business very well. It is the only thing that we do, and we did our homework. We built a brand when those companies didn't believe in the Internet.''</p>
        <p>Yet, despite its early leadership in the Latin American market, the uncertainties are mounting for StarMedia. In the last year, huge international players like Terra and America Online have made Latin America's growing Internet market a major priority. And many of the region's dominant media and telecommunication companies are also devoting huge resources to building up Internet businesses. Some analysts say StarMedia no longer has what it takes to compete alone in the new highly competitive Latin American Internet market.</p>
        <p>''What looks on the basis of 1999 numbers as a commanding lead, will, on 2000 numbers, look like StarMedia is one of many rather than a clear leader,'' said Lars Schonander, a media analyst in Mexico City for the investment bank ING Barings.</p>
        <p>And investors are hardly sanguine about StarMedia's stance. After Mr. Espuelas announced in March that the company would confront its growing competition by increasing its marketing spending by $12 million in the first half of the year, the stock plummeted 33 percent in one day.</p>
        <p>Even before that announcement, StarMedia was well off its high of $70, reached last July, six weeks after its public offering. Recently, with the oscillations in the Nasdaq market, the stock has fallen even more, closing at $15.0625 on Friday.</p>
        <p>Until recently, StarMedia had seemed to lead a charmed existence. Mr. Espuelas met the company's co-founder, Jack Chen, in the sixth grade. Both of their families had recently immigrated to Greenwich, Conn.; Mr. Espuelas's was from Uruguay, and Mr. Chen's was from China. As children, they took English classes together. As teenagers, they jointly won a high school debate championship.</p>
        <p>While still in his 20's, Mr. Espuelas took a vacation in the Nepalese Himalayas. It was there that he visualized what would become the underlying goal of StarMedia: to knock down cultural barriers in Latin America through universal Internet access.</p>
        <p>''The whole cliche about why would an Argentine care about a Chilean is just not true,'' he said. ''It is part of the same type of propaganda that has been fed to us for 200 years about why there should be separate countries. Now, we are faced with a generation in Latin America in which 60 or 65 percent of the people are younger than 24 years of age. This is truly the Internet generation and this generation will grow with a completely different set of experiences.''</p>
        <p>In 1996, Mr. Espuelas quit his job as managing director for marketing for AT&amp;T's Latin American operations. Along with Mr. Chen, who was by then a Wall Street investment banker, he moved back to Connecticut to start StarMedia out of the Chen family's house.</p>
        <p>Noting the success of Yahoo in the United States, the two men designed StarMedia as a so-called content aggregator. StarMedia would build a gateway to various Spanish-  and Portuguese-language Web sites rather than go through the costly process of creating its own sites. At the time, Latin America was barely on the Internet radar screen.</p>
        <p>StarMedia used a storm of local television commercials to make itself a household name in the region. And while Latin America's nascent Internet service providers struggled to build the network capacity to meet the budding demand for Internet access, StarMedia was busy gathering Spanish and Portuguese content sites to give the new Web surfers places to surf.</p>
        <p>Multinational advertisers like I.B.M. and General Motors, looking to the Latin American Internet market, gravitated toward StarMedia on the strength of its brand and the conviction of its chief executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Espuelas's leadership is considered one of the driving forces behind the company's early success, and a reason why its stock was initially so popular with investors.</p>
        <p>''When you meet Fernando, it is kind of love at first sight,'' said Susan Segal, general partner at Chase Capital Partners, who, along with Fred Wilson, managing partner at Flatiron Partners, put up the initial $3.5 million in seed financing for StarMedia in 1997. ''He and Jack are a very charismatic management team.''</p>
        <p>In October 1997, StarMedia captured $80 million in its third round of financing, the largest equity investment in a private Internet company up to that time. The celebrity from that investment, in turn, helped the company raise $110 million in its May 1999 initial public offering. All told, StarMedia has raised almost half a billion dollars in the public and private markets.</p>
        <p>The company has put some of the money to use by buying Brazil's leading Internet search services, Zeek and Cade, and a handful of other Internet properties around the region to add to StarMedia's basic chat rooms and free e-mail service. New wireless and broadband-network units have been started to enable StarMedia to expand its audience to users of cell phones and high-speed cable modems.</p>
        <p>And the company's hefty marketing budget has made helped it become the Latin American leader in Internet advertising revenue -- $10 million in this year's first quarter. That outpaced Terra and the region's other publicly traded Web company, El Sitio.</p>
        <p>But StarMedia's first-starter advantages are quickly fading. In Mexico, StarMedia's strongest market, local competition is heating up. Telefonos de Mexico, the country's largest telecommunications company, has teamed up with Microsoft to start a portal and Internet access service called T1MSN.com. And two big Mexican media companies, Grupo Televisa (EsMas.com) and Televisa Azteca (todito.com) have also recently started Web portals.</p>
        <p>So far, though, StarMedia has preferred to remain independent.</p>
        <p>''We have 200 strategic relationships with content providers across the globe, which we think adds infinitely more value that having one big-name relationship,'' Mr. Espuelas said. ''I think that is something that is not really understood in Latin America, which has such an historic bias toward these big media monopolies.''</p>
        <p>But many analysts expect Latin America to mirror Internet development in Europe, where big telecommunications and media companies dominate the Web scene.</p>
        <p>StarMedia's experience in Brazil, seen as Latin America's most promising Internet market, provides a telling example of the challenges it faces.</p>
        <p>Here, where fewer than 7 million people out of a population of 165 million are online, and forecasts call for perhaps an additional 2 million people to get Internet access this year, StarMedia had a weak start. The company's underlying concept of a borderless pan-Latin community did not play well with the Portuguese-speaking Brazilians.</p>
        <p>''The problem with StarMedia is that it always tried to head the Latin American market, but Brazilians don't think that they are Latin,'' said Alvaro de Castro, new business director at the Internet consulting company Visualcom and author of books on e-commerce and e-marketing in Brazil. ''When Brazilians entered the StarMedia.com Web site and were asked to select what country they were from off of a list, they would say: What are we doing among all those other countries?''</p>
        <p>While StarMedia was busy rethinking its Brazilian strategy, local companies were making inroads into the market. Universo Online, or UOL, a joint venture of two Sao Paulo newspaper and magazine publishing giants, the Folha Group and Editora Abril, began providing Internet access and set up a comprehensive portal with content supplied by its parent companies. More important, UOL mounted a formidable advertising campaign using its parents' own media outlets, which include Sao Paulo's leading newspaper, Folha de Sao Paulo, and Brazil's leading weekly news magazine, Veja.</p>
        <p>In this year's first quarter, UOL said it logged 2.9 billion page views. Compared with StarMedia's 2.1 billion views, that would place UOL firmly in the lead among the region's Internet companies. But StarMedia contends that UOL's figures, which are audited by Ernst &amp; Young in Sao Paulo, would not hold up under the scrutiny of the Internet traffic auditor ABC Interactive, an American company that StarMedia says is the measurement standard.</p>
        <p>Recently, StarMedia had some success in giving its Brazilian site a more authentically local feel. The redesigned portal, StarMedia 6.0, takes Brazilian Web surfers directly to local news and issues. The company also introduced a new television and print advertising campaign that featured a local soap opera star.</p>
        <p>''As the first mover, StarMedia still occupies a lot of space in the market,'' said Marcos Moraes, founder of Zip.net in Brazil, which was recently acquired by Portugal Telecom's PT Multimedia for about $200 million.</p>
        <p>In Brazil, where a dozen portals vie for a limited audience, consolidation is soon expected to reduce the number of players to perhaps three or four. In competing to be one of the survivors, StarMedia's main rivals will be UOL, the Brazilian media power Globo, Terra/Lycos, Zip.net/PT Multimedia and AOL.</p>
        <p>Adding to the pressures, a group of Internet access providers shocked the market last December by offering free dial-up service in Brazil. Independent service providers, which used to feed traffic to StarMedia because they lacked content of their own, may now be forced to join with portals to compensate for their lost revenue streams.</p>
        <p>''None of the portals has any idea what will be at the end of this race,'' said Jack London, a Brazilian who founded Booknet, an online bookseller, and other Internet properties.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Espuelas contends that the strength of StarMedia's content will draw new users to its site.</p>
        <p>''The explosion of free I.S.P.'s in Brazil is a wonderful thing,'' Mr. Espuelas said, referring to Internet service providers. ''It is lowering costs, bringing more people online. We want to create the same dynamic in all of the major markets by essentially demolishing the paid I.S.P. model.''</p>
