        <p>This is the first Memorial Day of the new millennium, and thus an appropriate moment to examine the meaning of past Memorial Days</p>

        <p>These two ideas, remembrance and reconciliation, will surely survive in the century ahead. But there may be subtle changes in the spirit if not the essential purposes of the holiday, just as there have been changes in the demography of the marchers. It has been many years since old men in threadbare gray and blue uniforms paraded down the nation's main streets. It has been 20 years at least since we saw more than a few veterans of World War I. Now the cohort that fought World War II is diminishing. George Bush, senior, is almost certainly that celebrated generation's last president.</p>
        <p>Our cultural memory is also receding, especially the recollection of what it was like to have an entire country mobilized, body and soul, to fight an enemy. The First and Second World Wars were, to most Americans, unambiguously noble, and so in its goals of eliminating slavery and saving the union was the Civil War. But since then our conflicts have become less clear-cut -- most famously Vietnam, but also to some extent Korea and even Mr. Bush's Desert Storm.</p>
        <p>In this new century, wars are likely to become even more ambiguous and even less likely to muster automatic support. Indeed, we already know what it is like to engage in gray wars, rather than those in black and white -- murky, uncertain yet undeniably dangerous involvements like those in Somalia and Kosovo.</p>
        <p>The question is whether in such circumstances Americans will continue to honor their dead as wholeheartedly as they did in the past. The chances are good that they will. Honor came slowly to the veterans of Vietnam, but eventually it arrived. Five years ago, after many delays, a memorial was finally created for the veterans of Korea.</p>
        <p>Even if one questions the validity of a war, it is still possible to honor individual sacrifice. Indeed, it is obligatory.</p>
