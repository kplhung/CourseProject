        <p>It has been more than three decades since Senator Robert F. Kennedy cast a spotlight on the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn by making it the focus of a bold new economic development program. By uniting ''the best of community action with the best of the private enterprise system,'' he said, a model urban neighborhood could arise from the ashes of ''physical decay and human despair.''</p>
        <p>For a while, the plan worked. Its most visible achievement was the conversion of an abandoned milk bottling plant in the heart of the neighborhood into a shopping plaza and cultural center. But there was more: hundreds of homes were rehabilitated, thousands of jobs were created, the neighborhood got its first large supermarket in years (a Pathmark that is still operating), and I.B.M. brought in a computer cable production factory that once employed 450 people.</p>
        <p>A generation later, however, the predominantly black New York neighborhood that is reaping the benefits of a robust economy is Harlem, not Bedford-Stuyvesant.</p>
        <p>Far from being central to current political and economic plans for reviving neglected areas, Bedford-Stuyvesant has receded into the shadows, community leaders say. Some blame the perception of rampant crime, even though crime is down. Others say Harlem has more political clout in Washington.</p>
        <p>But many people both inside and outside Bedford-Stuyvesant also say that the organization that was intended to help bring prosperity to central Brooklyn -- the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation -- has served as an impediment to progress, an entrenched and sluggish bureaucracy instead of a spark plug for local entrepreneurs and nationally known merchants. Even the organization's new board chairman, Albert C. Wiltshire, says that Restoration needs to be put back on course.</p>
        <p>The lightning rod for some of the criticism is Roderick B. Mitchell, the president and chief executive of Restoration for the last 12 years. His detractors call him prickly and arrogant, incapable of working cooperatively with other community leaders and unwilling to endorse any proposal that does not give Restoration joint ownership. Some local business owners say he has opposed efforts to bring new jobs to the area.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Mitchell, who has a master's degree in business from Columbia University, contends that the Restoration has grown steadily stronger under his stewardship, having weathered the crisis that almost killed it during the Reagan years, when its financing dried up.</p>
        <p>He cited several new businesses in Restoration Plaza -- among them Score, a computer learning center for children, and a Sterling Optical Center -- and the organization's continuing support of several longstanding cultural programs, including an art gallery and two theaters. He also pointed to a long-term $9.8 million project, which is nearing completion, to make the fortresslike Restoration Plaza more inviting.</p>
        <p>''Restoration was always intended to be a catalyst to improve the quality of life, and we have held true to that mission,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''We have not deviated one bit. There's no question about it, that Restoration's achievements over the past 30 years have been extraordinary. And when you look at the amount of money that we have had available to us, it's even more extraordinary.''</p>
        <p>Restoration, a nonprofit corporation, oversees 11 subsidiaries. In its early years, Mr. Mitchell said, an estimated 80 percent of the company's revenue came from government sources, but in more recent years, it has received most of its money from rent and other earnings, he said. Last year, according to documents filed with the state attorney general's office, Restoration received $1 million in government grants and raised $1.3 million privately.</p>
        <p>But the organization's glory days seem to have ended. Once a model for about 2,000 community development corporations across the country, Restoration is now running large deficits ($990,000 this past fiscal year, and $1.6 million the year before). Restoration-sponsored construction has ceased, and the organization has managed to attract only a few new businesses to the neighborhood in recent years.</p>
        <p>When I.B.M. moved out in 1993, the company was replaced by an employee-owned computer repair business, where only 30 people now work. During the last fiscal year, Restoration reported that it spent $2.6 million on its programs, only $130,000 of which was used for economic development.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to say that Restoration has outlived its usefulness,'' said Carlton A. Brown, a developer and a Bedford-Stuyvesant resident. ''But they are stuck in a time warp. The organization under Mr. Mitchell has just not been that effective.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown, who is developing a commercial and residential project in Harlem that is also sponsored by the City Department of Housing Preservation and Development and the New York City Housing Partnership, said that Mr. Mitchell had failed to take advantage of similar opportunities in Bedford-Stuyvesant. (Mr. Mitchell, however, said that building housing was not part of his organization's mission.)</p>
        <p>Some of Bedford-Stuyvesant's problems are apparent on Fulton Street, the bustling main commercial thoroughfare. It has street vendors, 99-cent stores, beauty and nail salons, jewelry and liquor stores, but few essential services like dry cleaners and sit-down restaurants. There are no movie theaters, bookstores or record stores.</p>
        <p>''Recently, I needed to get an antenna for my television set,'' said Joanne Jeffrey, a neighborhood resident who works for the Police Department. ''I'm driving all over the place just to find an antenna. To me, that's ridiculous.''</p>
        <p>There are, of course, many other explanations for the slow pace of commercial development in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a community of about 140,000 people. Central Brooklyn, home to about 300,000 people, has no politician to match Charles B. Rangel, the Harlem congressman who was instrumental in freeing up hundreds of millions of federal, state and city dollars for the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone. Unlike Harlem, Bedford-Stuyvesant never had a glamorous aura. Nor does it have the high density that many retailers seek.</p>
        <p>To out-of-town retail executives (and many New Yorkers), Bedford-Stuyvesant is a still a scary place. Crime has decreased considerably in recent years, but not as much as elsewhere in the city, according to a  study sponsored by the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, an organization that assists community development corporations.</p>
        <p>Some merchants remain fearful. Nadi Ali, the owner of a men's clothing store on Fulton Street whose name he did not want published, keeps three German shepherds in back of his store as protection against break-ins. ''They need more security in the streets,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Felix Liz, the manager of Town of Bargains, a furniture store on Broadway, said the neighborhood had become far safer in the last six years. ''You could not walk on the street like you're walking today,'' Mr. Liz said.</p>
        <p>Bounded by Flushing Avenue on the north, Broadway and Saratoga on the east, Atlantic Avenue on the south, and Classon Avenue on the west, Bedford-Stuyvesant (then known simply as Bedford) was once a fashionable district and home to retail magnates like Abraham Abraham and F. W. Woolworth.</p>
        <p>With its hundreds of blocks of beautifully tended turn-of-the-century brownstones, Bedford-Stuyvesant has better housing stock than Harlem, a higher degree of home ownership and a larger proportion of middle-class residents. Property values in Bedford-Stuyvesant are rising, fueled by an influx of professionals seeking the kind of space and architectural details that are priced beyond their means in more gentrified Brooklyn neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Bedford-Stuyvesant could support some of the amenities that are cropping up in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn: coffee bars, art galleries and other urban ''eye candy,'' said Colvin W. Grannum, the chief executive of the Bridge Street Development Corporation, a church-affiliated group in Bedford-Stuyvesant that has worked closely with the New York City Housing Partnership to develop affordable housing.</p>
        <p>But first the community has to advertise its strengths, he said. ''Forty percent of the people are poor, and business people look at that and say, 'There is no way this is going to work,' '' Mr. Grannum said. ''But the other 60 percent is solid, working-class families, and there is even some affluence.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell of Restoration, who is paid $135,000 a year, said there was a ''red line that still circles this community,'' making it very difficult to get financing for economic development. He said it was practically impossible to get national retailers to return telephone calls, much less tour the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>But a number of people who have tried to work with Mr. Mitchell, in the financial community and nonprofit world, say he himself makes the job harder. Most, however, are afraid to take him on in public.</p>
        <p>People who are willing to speak on the record fault Mr. Mitchell in particular for failing to exploit opportunities to create more of the small businesses that can begin to turn around a neighborhood's image. Robert Simmons, a former McDonald's franchise owner who operates seven small businesses in Bedford-Stuyvesant -- all financed with his own capital -- said Mr. Mitchell rejected his proposal to develop long-vacant property at Fulton Street and Albany Avenue into a restaurant. Mr. Simmons said that Mr. Mitchell was ''contributing to the negative look of the neighborhood by letting that building stay vacant.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell acknowledged that he told Mr. Simmons he had other plans for the parcel. ''I can understand why Robert would be disturbed or even upset because he had a plan and that was a potential site,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''But then, we have a potential plan and a strategy also that we want to put in place. It doesn't mean that what Robert is doing I don't value.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell declined to disclose how he would use the site. ''Our strategic plan is for internal purposes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Other people say Mr. Mitchell is wasting an asset right in Restoration Plaza: a recording studio in the basement that was once known as the Platinum Factory. Mr. Brown, the Harlem developer, said he got the brush-off when he tried to help a music producer lease the studio. Kevin A. Griffith, a former engineer at the Platinum Factory, filed a lawsuit contending that Mr. Mitchell reneged on a deal to revive the recording studio and never returned a $25,000 investment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell said he planned to move the recording studio, because the A train runs below it. He had no comment on the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell has also come under attack for resisting a union drive by handymen, porters and superintendents employed by Restoration. In March, the employees voted to become part of Teamsters Local 966.</p>
        <p>Maintaining that he has been a friend to local entrepreneurs, Mr. Mitchell said that Restoration had lent more than $500,000 to small businesses in Brooklyn since 1995, including $150,000 to finance the Sterling Optical store (which is jointly owned by Restoration). One of the beneficiaries of the loan program was Howell Petroleum, a company that distributed automotive lubricant but was seeking to expand and become a general contractor.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Bill Howell, the president and chief executive of the company, now known as Howell Industries, and a Bedford-Stuyvesant resident, said that Restoration had failed to take a leadership role in bringing the community better retail services, a shortcoming that was underscored when no one from the organization showed up at a recent ''economic summit meeting'' made up of numerous church and neighborhood groups.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell said he did not know of such a meeting.</p>
        <p>''I always viewed Restoration as the center of the community for economic development,'' Mr. Howell said. ''I think it's falling short. A lot more can be done.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Howell said he expected Restoration to turn around under Mr. Wiltshire, who was elected board chairman in March. Mr. Wiltshire, the manager of government relations for Consolidated Edison and a board member of three other community organizations, also said that Restoration needed to work cooperatively with other groups.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wiltshire said he planned to hire a consultant to subject Restoration to the kind of scrutiny it has not previously encountered. The organization's board, of which he has been a member of 13 years, ''needs to be proactive, as opposed to reactive,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the board has lived up to its responsibilities,'' he said, ''and that includes me.''</p>
