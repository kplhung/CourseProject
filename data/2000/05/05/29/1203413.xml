        <p>Sean Lambert played an important role in the team title of Brooklyn's South Shore High School yesterday in the 95th Public Schools Athletic League outdoor championships at St. John's.</p>
        <p>Lambert, a senior, put on a brilliant display in the sprints, which gave South Shore 30 of its 94 points in winning its first outdoor crown to go with its initial indoor title last winter. Jefferson of Brooklyn was second with 82 points followed by Tottenville of Staten Island with 57.</p>
        <p>Lambert won the 100-meter dash in 10.66 seconds and the 200 in 21.36, and anchored the winning 4x400 relay with a split of 47.5 seconds, which clinched the team title.</p>
        <p>His teammate Nimal Bailey also had a hand in 30 points, winning the 400 hurdles and the pentathlon, and running the first leg on the 4x400 relay.</p>
        <p>A.P. Randolph of Manhattan had only three individual winners but tallied enough points to beat back Boys &amp; Girls of Brooklyn, 78-74, to win the girls' title. It gave Randolph's coach, Phyllis Anderson, her second straight sweep of P.S.A.L. indoor and outdoor championships.</p>
        <p>Neisha Bernard Thomas of Brooklyn's Tilden was first in the 400 in 54.56 and the 800 in 2 minutes 11.44 seconds, and ran a second-leg 400 split of 54.7 on the winning 4x400 relay (3:46.43). Her 800 time is the fastest in the state this year.</p>
        <p>Paula George of Taft in the Bronx won the 100 in 12.14 and the long jump at 19 feet 5 3/4 inches, and was third in the 200.</p>
