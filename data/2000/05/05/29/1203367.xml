        <p>For nearly a century, the compact between ranchers and oilmen created the huge wealth that built modern Texas. The ranchers owned the land, the wildcatters found the oil, and everyone got rich together. Oil money built universities and football stadiums, gaudy hotels and world-class art museums.</p>
        <p>Even today, an estimated one million people in Texas receive some sort of oil or gas royalty check.</p>
        <p>But oil is no longer king in Texas, and as the economy has changed, the state has grappled with a less glamorous legacy of the high-flying days. There are 25,000 abandoned oil wells in Texas, an additional 15,000 sitting idle and tens of thousands of others that could be leaking and threatening underground aquifers at a time when drought has made water the state's most precious natural resource.</p>
        <p>Now, the ranchers and the oil producers, the mythic figures of modern Texas, are fighting over cleaning up the mess. A growing number of prominent ranchers, including former Gov. Dolph Briscoe and the caretakers of the fabled King Ranch, are organizing against the oil industry, seeking changes in environmental and royalty laws, and portraying state regulators as toothless. Oil producers, on the other hand, say the landowners are just grabbing for money as the industry is only now recovering from its latest downturn.</p>
        <p>''Some of these guys are out here biting the hand that fed them,'' said John Bell, an independent oil producer.</p>
        <p>In the Texas of old, what was good for Big Oil was considered good for Texas. But attitudes are gradually changing as industries like high technology and health care lead the state's thriving economy. In recent months, citizens' groups in central Texas have fought plans to reopen a 700-mile underground gas pipeline, fearing that a leak could pollute the region's water source. In Houston, a new generation of business leaders, alarmed by the city's smog problem, is calling for solutions that include sharp reductions in pollution from nearby refineries.</p>
        <p>Here in the harsh mesquite desert of West Texas, where the underground sea of crude oil known as the Permian Basin once made Midland a boom town, the bravado of the bygone era is not yet gone. Thousands of oil pumps still bob slowly up and down in the surrounding flat terrain, where the average summer temperatures exceed 100 degrees. Hotels still decorate rooms with paintings of oil wells.</p>
        <p>A huge white Cadillac rumbling down Big Spring Street summarized the enduring local sentiment with a bumper sticker: ''Wake Up America: For Our Security We Need American Oil.''</p>
        <p>Inside his office at the Permian Basin Petroleum Association, the executive director, Morris Burns, brightened at the memory of the region's past influence. ''This was what won World War II,'' Mr. Burns said, recalling that the Permian Basin produced 25 percent of the world's oil to keep the American war machine going.</p>
        <p>But production peaked in 1972, the oil bust came in the 1980's, and in the 1990's oil production in Texas dropped by a third. The recent spike in oil prices has helped producers recover from the disastrously low prices of 1998, but the overall trend is the slow decline of what analysts describe as a ''mature'' industry. For more than a decade, the major oil companies have been pulling out of West Texas, and this week Mr. Burns wearily absorbed another defection, as ARCO announced it would close its local office, which employs 165 people.</p>
        <p>The newfound public advocacy of the ranchers is only the latest blow. Like so many in the oil industry, Mr. Burns says he suspects that trial lawyers in search of a new source of fees may account for part of it. He acknowledged that a small number of ''bad actors'' in the oil industry had behaved irresponsibly, but he said many of them had left the business over the past decade as regulations tightened.</p>
        <p>''Producers have become much more environmentally aware in the last 15 years,'' Mr. Burns said.</p>
        <p>Yet drive an hour west of Midland, past tiny oil towns like Goldsmith and the aptly named Notrees, and the environmental legacy is evident on the 174,000-acre Frying Pan Ranch. The property's owner, D. K. Boyd, bought it four years ago, adding it to his five other ranches in West Texas and New Mexico.</p>
        <p>In all, his properties contain more than 2,000 oil wells. But when Mr. Boyd hired a San Antonio environmental consulting company to audit his properties, it found about 1,000 contaminated sites, with environmental damage estimated at more than $25 million.</p>
        <p>There is heated disagreement about who is responsible for the mess, and Mr. Boyd is tied up in fiercely contested litigation with several of the oil producers leasing mineral rights on his property.</p>
        <p>But regardless of blame, a short tour of the Frying Pan reveals obvious examples of the problems that ranchers say exist across Texas. A tank where crude oil is separated from salt water has spilled into the surrounding soil. A pipeline that burst a few weeks ago has left a brown stain across a 50-yard section. Mr. Boyd's ranch foreman, Bill Warbois, said some oil companies did little more than dump dirt to cover up the problems.</p>
        <p>''That's wet oil,'' Mr. Warbois said, pinching some of the brown sand between his fingers. ''You can smell it. You can pick that dirt up and literally squeeze the oil out of it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyd, who ran his own independent oil company for 20 years, said the city of Midland had approached him about water rights in recent weeks for an aquifer that extends more than 20,000 acres beneath the Frying Pan. He said that he had not thoroughly tested the water source, but that a handful of test wells had shown some evidence of contamination.</p>
        <p>''Water is more valuable than oil and gas, and becoming more so every day,'' Mr. Boyd said.</p>
        <p>Vince Matthews, director for the Center for Energy and Economic Development at the University of Texas of the Permian Basin in Midland, said many of the wells on ranches like the Frying Pan had been drilled by the major oil companies more than 50 years ago and were now inevitably showing signs of deterioration. Mr. Matthews said smaller independent oil companies eagerly bought the properties with the exodus of the major concerns, but they did so as federal regulation tightened and environmental awareness started to take hold.</p>
        <p>''The large oil companies saw this coming,'' Mr. Matthews said. ''They said, 'We don't need this. We can go to plenty of places around the world, find bigger reserves, and we don't have to put up with this litigious society.' ''</p>
        <p>Environmental complaints have grown steadily in the past decade. Richard Lowerre, an environmental lawyer in Austin, said lawsuits over the contamination of ground water had become more common, particularly in West Texas. Oil companies often settle cases with an agreement requiring landowners not to disclose the terms, Mr. Lowerre said.</p>
        <p>In 1997, the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the oil industry, reported 77 cases of ground water contamination from oil and natural gas activities, the majority of them in the Permian Basin, the most drought-stricken section of the state. In 1998, the commission received 976 complaints of oil field pollution from landowners.</p>
        <p>In November, a number of prominent ranchers and large landowners founded the Texas Land and Mineral Owners Association. The approximately 500 members, who control millions of acres, include many from the ranching families that helped found Texas.</p>
        <p>''This has never happened before in Texas,'' said Doug Beveridge, who manages land and oil leases for the King Ranch in South Texas. ''You have never had landowners come together like this, exclusively. It should have happened 10 years ago.''</p>
        <p>Property rights are a passionate political issue in Texas, and in broad terms, the landowners are concerned primarily with pollution cleanup and royalties and their belief that the regulatory and legal landscape favors the oil and natural gas companies.</p>
        <p>In Texas, unlike in many states, land ownership is severed between the surface and the minerals below. As a result, a landowner may or may not control the rights to any oil or natural gas below the ground. The oil companies sign leases with mineral owners, which grant them rights to drill wells and build pipelines. The mineral owners are paid royalties on any oil or gas production, while the landowners usually receive only a one-time payment of several thousand dollars for the use of their land.</p>
        <p>In many cases, including that of Mr. Boyd, landowners also hold most of the mineral rights on their property. Usually, a company will sign a surface damage agreement with a landowner that stipulates cleanup responsibilities. But many landowners say there are companies that disregard the agreements or refuse to sign one.</p>
        <p>The state requires that oil companies seal a well with cement plugs once production has stopped in order to prevent contaminants from escaping. The cost of plugging a well usually runs as much as $4,500. But some companies have just abandoned wells unplugged, particularly since 1998, when low prices drove many smaller independent companies to bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>The landowners' association is lobbying for new laws addressing concerns about royalties and the legal rights of landowners in disputes over property damage, Mr. Beveridge said. The group is also proposing a bill to block oil and natural gas companies from abandoning wells.</p>
        <p>The Texas Legislature has sporadically addressed the problem of abandoned wells by, among other things, passing a law that imposed a fee on oil and natural gas production to pay for plugging them. Last year, the state plugged about 1,600 wells. But declining production has meant fewer dollars coming into the cleanup fund. Oil companies also benefit from a state program that allows them to pay $100 for annual extensions on plugging wells. In some cases, companies have used these extensions to delay plugging for years. Officials estimate that 15,000 wells remain idle and unplugged because of this program.</p>
        <p>Public attention to the problems was heightened in September when The San Antonio Express-News published a series of articles detailing the full scope of the problem. The Express-News series also explored the historically friendly relationship between the railroad commission and the oil industry. The commission's three members are elected and often receive large contributions from oil producers.</p>
        <p>''Historically, there has been a great deal of cynicism, and people have characterized the railroad commission as a captive agency,'' said Tony Garza, a Republican member of the commission since 1998. ''From time to time, their concerns have been extremely borne out.''</p>
        <p>In recent months, Mr. Garza has pushed the commission to be more aggressive in addressing abandoned wells and has met with resistance. At last month's commission meeting, Mr. Garza's proposal to curtail the $100 program was never brought to a vote. In the coming days, the commission's chairman, Michael Williams, is expected to make a recommendation on the fee program based on the findings of a commission he appointed to address the issue.</p>
        <p>Just as the oil industry is declining, so, too, are many cattle ranches across Texas. Jan Wheelis, whose family has owned the McFaddin Ranch in Victoria County in South Texas since 1840, said she must find every way imaginable for her land to make money. She is considering harvesting mesquite trees, and she has leased hunting rights.</p>
        <p>''You can make more money off hunting than oil in this place,'' Ms. Wheelis said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wheelis still keeps 250 head of cattle, but she has found that the drought makes it increasingly difficult to do so.</p>
        <p>And so, she said, does the legacy of oil. Many of the 57 wells on her land are abandoned. Last month, she filed a suit against two companies, claiming that their failure to mend broken pipelines and other problems had created an environmental mess. In all, Ms. Wheelis said, she had lost 40 of her 2,664 acres to contamination.</p>
        <p>Driving toward a lake of old cypress trees recently, Ms. Wheelis stopped her truck and listened to a metallic sound coming from a neighboring property.</p>
        <p>''They're drilling another well,'' she said, and she drove away.</p>
