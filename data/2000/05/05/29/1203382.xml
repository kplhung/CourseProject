        <p>Two men facing an avalanche of evidence in last week's execution-style massacre at a Wendy's restaurant stood silently at their arraignment as a prosecutor described in chilling detail how the victims were bound, gagged and blindfolded, their heads covered with plastic bags, and shot one by one as they knelt in a freezer room.</p>
        <p>The district attorney in charge of the case said each defendant, who faced 25 counts, including murder and robbery, had made a videotaped confession implicating himself and his accomplice.</p>

        <p>Two men facing an avalanche of evidence in last week's execution-style massacre at a Wendy's restaurant stood silently at their arraignment as a prosecutor described in chilling detail how the victims were bound, gagged and blindfolded, their heads covered with plastic bags, and shot one by one as they knelt in a freezer room.</p>
        <p>The district attorney in charge of the case said each defendant, who faced 25 counts, including murder and robbery, had made a videotaped confession implicating himself and his accomplice.</p>
        <p>The admissions, he said, include a ''calculated plan'' to rob the restaurant on Main Street in Flushing, Queens, where one had worked last fall, and to kill the workers to eliminate witnesses. The statements also include numerous details about how the executions were carried out and how $2,400 in cash was stolen.</p>
