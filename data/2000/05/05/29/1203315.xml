        <p>DAVID LORD seemed in remarkably good spirits last Tuesday -- considering that a day earlier, Mr. Lord, chief executive of the online toy retailer Toysmart.com, had announced he was closing the company and laying off its 170 employees. ''We all knew there'd be a shakeout this quarter,'' Mr. Lord said, then laughed. ''We just didn't think it would include us.''</p>
        <p>Toysmart, a unit of Walt Disney based in Waltham, Mass., was one of three Internet retailers to cry uncle last week. CraftShop.com, one of the earliest online craft stores, filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, having ceased operations earlier this month. And Brandwise.com, a joint venture between Hearst and Whirlpool, ceased operations on Thursday.</p>
        <p>The previous week, Boo.com, an Internet sportswear merchant in London with a global sales operation and about $135 million in financing, announced that it was liquidating.</p>
        <p>Although other e-tailers have quietly suspended operations this year -- Viacom's online toy store, RedRocket.com, and Cybershop.com, a gift shop, are but two examples -- the recent shutdowns have been the most visible e-commerce casualties to date.</p>
        <p>The consensus within the Internet industry is that more closings will follow quickly, as investors continue to turn a cold shoulder to Web merchants that burned through the venture financing they received last year. But analysts disagree about the meaning of the recent closings.</p>
        <p>Some analysts say the shakeout represents a healthy dose of digital Darwinism -- the market's acknowledgment that it does not need dozens of online toy sites or craft stores, when just a few will do. But other analysts suggest that as investors continue their wholesale rejection of consumer e-commerce companies, they may be condemning some companies that deserve a better fate.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the chief executives of Boo, Toysmart and CraftShop said they, too, deserved better. But they also acknowledged committing crucial mistakes that led to their demise -- mistakes they said they were determined not to repeat in their next e-commerce endeavors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lord of Toysmart said one of the first e-mail messages he received after announcing his company's shutdown came from a venture capitalist. ''It was one of those I-told-you-sos; I knew it was coming,'' Mr. Lord said, declining to identify the note's sender. ''He offered me $25 million last year, and I turned him down.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lord said he had rejected the deal because he believed at the time that he had a better offer on the table -- an investment of roughly $45 million from Disney, which included $20 million in cash and the rest in advertising across Disney's media properties.</p>
        <p>In that deal, which was announced in August, Disney secured a controlling interest in Toysmart. In turn, Toysmart got an enthusiastic supporter in Chuck Davis, who was then the president of e-commerce for the Buena Vista Internet Group, the unit that oversees Disney's Internet properties.</p>
        <p>More than anything else, Mr. Lord said, the Disney alignment caused Toysmart's demise. ''They're a great company,'' he said. ''It just operates on a different timetable. And when time is running out, you don't want to operate on a slow timetable.''</p>
        <p>Practically speaking, time ran out on Toysmart at the end of last year, when the stock market began to flee Internet retailers en masse, before Mr. Lord could take Toysmart public. Toysmart had spent $20 million on holiday marketing, and with the capital markets closed, the company's prospects dimmed.</p>
        <p>Because Disney works more slowly than venture capitalists, Mr. Lord said, ''the deal cost us four months.'' And with that time, he said, the company might have been able to go public before the window for stock offerings in e-tailers slammed shut.</p>
        <p>Disney's initial ardor for Toysmart had meanwhile faded after Mr. Davis left Buena Vista late last year for another Internet company. Then, two months ago, Disney announced that its Internet focus had shifted from commerce to entertainment and leisure.</p>
        <p>''We certainly knew it wasn't good for us,'' Mr. Lord said.</p>
        <p>''If corporations call me now to come lead their dot-com, I'll think about what would happen if, two years down the road, the strategy changed,'' he said. ''Or if it takes six months to fund instead of three. It's all about time. Time, time, time.''</p>
        <p>For Boo, time was one of many enemies. The European fashion e-tailer had ambitious plans to sell luxury sportswear brands in 18 nations through one of the most technologically sophisticated Web sites available in e-commerce. And it raised about $135 million for the effort.</p>
        <p>But when the Boo.com site opened in November, five months behind schedule, the company had already spent tens of millions of dollars on marketing in the United States and Europe.</p>
        <p>The late start hurt in several ways, according to Ernst Malmsten, Boo's chief executive. Because the marketing had created huge expectations, particularly in Britain and on the Continent, the company was unable to test the site with a quiet rollout, in which traffic builds gradually and kinks can be worked out before visitors start showing up in droves.</p>
        <p>Instead, Boo.com had a decidedly noisy introduction, which led to a chorus of journalists complaining that features like 3-D photography and a talking saleswoman left those Internet users with slow modem connections -- the majority of users, in other words -- waiting endlessly for pages to load. The company added a low-bandwidth feature in February, to make the site work faster for the modemed masses. But by that time many of the consumers Boo had reached with its advertising campaign had visited, and sworn off, the site.</p>
        <p>Boo's staff, meanwhile, had grown to about 400 people, who worked feverishly to support a complex sales-fulfillment operation that allowed users to see only the items that Boo's distributors had in stock, in their preferred language, with prices in their nation's currency. One Boo executive estimated that the nonmarketing costs associated with building its global operation were $50 million to $70 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Malmsten said that aside from coordinating the site's rollout with its marketing -- and perhaps waiting until shoppers were more comfortable buying apparel online -- he should have tried to restrain the expectations raised by the company. ''But we all make lots of mistakes all the time,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mackie of CraftShop had more modest goals for his site -- and more modest financing to go with it. He said he had raised  $3 million to $5 million for the site, which went online in January. But he, too, was a victim of bad timing and less-than-perfect execution. The company originally sought to open the site before Christmas but failed because the technology was not ready; nor were there photographs of the 40,000 or so craft products the site sold.</p>
        <p>When the site did get up and running, Mr. Mackie said, it was not even close to meeting its sales goals, in part because it converted less than 1 percent of its visitors into buyers. ''We didn't have our merchandising department fleshed out,'' he said, ''so we didn't do a very good job of merchandising.''</p>
        <p>Because CraftShop's investors, including the venture firm CMGI, tied their financing to performance, the company did not receive the bulk of a $15 million pledge earlier this year. By that time, other venture capitalists were far too leery of e-tailing to come to the rescue.</p>
        <p>One final lesson for CraftShop, which may hold some truth for the broader e-commerce market, was that investors' timetable did not coincide with the demands of customers.</p>
        <p>''I knew when we got our early angel financing in March '99 that we were probably too late,'' Mr. Mackie said. ''People were already beginning to ask the hard questions about performance. But if we'd been earlier, the craft shoppers wouldn't have been ready, willing and able. The marketplace is just now warming up to this.''</p>
