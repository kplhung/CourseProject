        <p>A team-by-team look at the now 16-team league which kicks off it's 2000 season today with the Liberty playing Houston, the defending champions. Records and finishes are for last season.</p>

        <p>EASTERN CONFERENCE</p>
        <p>NEW YORK LIBERTY (18-12, first in East)</p>
        <p>Coach Richie Adubato Key Players Teresa Weatherspoon, 5-8 G; Vickie Johnson, 5-9 G; Sue Wicks, 6-3 F; Venus Lacey, 6-5 C  Season Outlook Nobody thought the Liberty could win last season, but they took Houston to three games in the finals. Even though center Kym Hampton retired, and Rebecca Lobo may not be available until July, the reserve center Lacey has been the biggest surprise of training camp. Crystal Robinson led the league in 3-pointers last season, and along with reliable veterans in Weatherspoon and Wicks, the Liberty could win a weak conference.</p>

        <p>EASTERN CONFERENCE</p>
        <p>NEW YORK LIBERTY (18-12, first in East)</p>
        <p>Coach Richie Adubato Key Players Teresa Weatherspoon, 5-8 G; Vickie Johnson, 5-9 G; Sue Wicks, 6-3 F; Venus Lacey, 6-5 C  Season Outlook Nobody thought the Liberty could win last season, but they took Houston to three games in the finals. Even though center Kym Hampton retired, and Rebecca Lobo may not be available until July, the reserve center Lacey has been the biggest surprise of training camp. Crystal Robinson led the league in 3-pointers last season, and along with reliable veterans in Weatherspoon and Wicks, the Liberty could win a weak conference.</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON MYSTICS (12-20, fifth)</p>
        <p>Coach Nancy Darsch Key Players Chamique Holdsclaw, 6-2 F; Nikki McCray, 5-11 G; Vicky Bullett, 6-3 F Season Outlook This could be the most improved team in the East, with Holdsclaw, the rookie of the year and McCray, an All-Star, joining Bullett. But there are early concerns because those two are battling injuries and Bullett is still playing in Brazil.</p>
        <p>ORLANDO MIRACLE (15-17, tied for second)</p>
        <p>Coach Carolyn Peck Key Players Shannon Johnson, 5-7 G; Nykesha Sales, 6-0 G; Taj McWilliams, 6-3 C. Season Outlook This team has one of the best backcourts in the conference, with the all-star Johnson and an improved Sales. McWilliams, who had eight double-doubles last season, brings leadership. The first-round pick Cintia Dos Santos, a 6-4 center from Brazil, needs experience but could solidify the frontcourt.</p>
        <p>CHARLOTTE STING (15-17, tied for second)</p>
        <p>Coach T.R. Dunn, first year Key Players Dawn Staley, 5-6 G; Tracy Reid, 6-0 F; Andrea Stinson (N.C. State '91), 5-10 G. Season Outlook Charlotte returns most of its core, after trading Vicky Bullett to Washington, but that core has also been prone to injuries in the preseason. The Olympic point guard Staley is recovering from knee surgery. Reid, the 1998 rookie of the year, is also injury prone and the lack of height could hurt the team.</p>
        <p>CLEVELAND ROCKERS (7-25, last)</p>
        <p>Coach Dan Hughes, first year Key Players Eva Nemcova, 6-3 F; Merlakia Jones, 5-9 G; Ann Wauters, 6-3 C; Suzie McConnell Serio, 5-6 G Season Outlook Wauters is a 19-year-old who can dunk, but she is slight and inexperienced. Nemcova is one of the sharpest shooters and most athletic players in the league, while Jones is a creative guard. Even though the Rockers might struggle at the point, they will be improved this year.</p>
        <p>DETROIT SHOCK (15-17, tied for second)</p>
        <p>Coach Nancy Lieberman-Cline Key Players Dominique Canty, 5-9 G; Wendy Palmer, 6-2 F; Edwina Brown, 5-9 G Season Outlook Brown, the first player selected in the draft, is a versatile addition to a team that lost three Australian players, who chose to train for their Olympic team instead. But Canty and Tamicha Jackson, the speedy rookie point guard, will make games interesting.</p>
        <p>INDIANA FEVER (Expansion team)</p>
        <p>Coach Anne Donovan (interim) Key Players Kara Wolters, 6-7 C; Stephanie McCarty, 5-9 G; Gordana Grubin, 5-11 G Season Outlook Wolters has had a strong preseason and will develop with tutoring from Donovan, the interim coach until the Olympic coach Nell Fortner arrives next season. McCarty, who won the 1999 N.C.A.A. title with Purdue, will be a draw for fans. But on a down note, Grubin, one of the best guards in the league last year at Los Angeles, injured her ankle in the preseason.</p>
        <p>MIAMI SOL (Expansion team)</p>
        <p>Coach Ron Rothstein Key Players Marlies Askamp, 6-5 C; Debbie Black, 5-2 G; Sharon Manning, 6-3 F Season Outlook Askamp, acquired from Minnesota, brings much-needed help in the paint. The scrappy point guard Black, acquired from Utah, is recovering from back surgery. The two best players Miami acquired will not be in uniform: center Elena Baranova blew out her knee and Sandy Brodello is training with the Australian national team.</p>
        <p>WESTERN CONFERENCE</p>
        <p>HOUSTON COMETS (26-6, W.N.B.A. Champion)</p>
        <p>Coach Van Chancellor Key Players Cynthia Cooper, 5-10 G; Sheryl Swoopes, 6-0 F, Tina Thompson, 6-3 F Season Outlook Once again, it is the Comets' championship to lose. Point guard is a small concern, with the former Connecticut star Jennifer Rizzotti set to split time with the Brazilian Janeth Arcain.</p>
        <p>SACRAMENTO MONARCHS (19-13, third in Western Conference)</p>
        <p>Coach Sonny Allen Key Players Yolanda Griffith, 6-3 F; Ticha Penicheiro, 5-10 G; Ruthie Bolton-Holifield, 5-9 G Season Outlook On paper, the deepest, most talented team in the league. Griffith is the league's reigning m.v.p. and defensive player of the year. Adding the former Olympian Katy Steding, the Monarchs could dethrone the Comets.</p>
        <p>PHOENIX MERCURY (15-17, tied fourth)</p>
        <p>Coach Cheryl Miller Key Players Jennifer Gillom, 6-3 C; Tonya Edwards, 5-10 G; Brandy Reed, 6-1 F Season Outlook The Mercury has been a dominating team in the West since the league began, and this year should be no different. Edwards and Reed, coming in a trade with Minnesota as the Lynx's leading scorers last year, have stepped right in, adding exciting offense to an already deep team.</p>
        <p>LOS ANGELES SPARKS (20-12, second in Western Conference)</p>
        <p>Coach Michael Cooper Key Players Lisa Leslie, 6-5 C; DeLisha Milton, 6-1 F; Tamecka Dixon, 5-9 G Season Outlook An underachieving team that finally broke through last season, the Sparks could be just as good this year. But four head-coaching changes in four years have underlined instability in management. Leslie and Milton are proven leaders in the paint, but L.A. might be shaky at point guard.</p>
        <p>UTAH STARZZ (15-17, tied fourth)</p>
        <p>Coach Fred Williams Key Players Natalie Williams, 6-2 F; Korie Hlede, 5-9 G; Margo Dydek, 7-2 C Season Outlook The Starzz are dangerous and very capable of finishing as high as second in the conference, even with point guard Jen Azzi sidelined until July with a broken hand. Utah could have its first winning season.</p>
        <p>MINNESOTA LYNX (15-17, tied fourth)</p>
        <p>Coach Brian Agler Key Players Katie Smith, 5-11 F; Kristin Folkl, 6-2 F; Andrea Lloyd-Curry, 6-2 F Season Outlook Agler traded veterans to receive eight draft picks. In the meantime, Smith, Lloyd-Curry and a fast-improving Folkl are all healthy and will help Minnesota stay competitive.</p>
        <p>PORTLAND FIRE (Expansion team)</p>
        <p>Coach Linda Hargrove Key Players Sophia Witherspoon, 5-10 G; Lynn Pride, 6-2 F; Tari Phillips, 6-1 F Season Outlook The Liberty lost Witherspoon in the expansion draft, and now she anchors a surprisingly deep team of other W.N.B.A. castoffs and young, versatile players like Pride.</p>
        <p>SEATTLE STORM (Expansion team)</p>
        <p>Coach Lin Dunn Key Players Edna Campell, 5-8 G; Kamila Vodichova, 6-4 F; Sonja Henning, 5-7 G Season Outlook This is probably the weakest of the four new franchises, but Dunn, a veteran coach, should coax some victories out of her limited talent. Vodichova, from the Czech Republic, could be the steal of the draft.</p>
