        <p>Over the din of a multi-screen sports bar, Dallas Hyde recalled the magical moment at a Calgary Flames hockey game, when ''he'' stood up in the crowd.</p>
        <p>''Everybody in the crowd went nuts,'' Mr. Hyde, 24, an oil change supervisor, recalled of the moment when Jeff Douglas stepped before a microphone to deliver The Rant.</p>
        <p>''I'm not a lumberjack or a fur trader; I don't live in an igloo, eat blubber or own a dogsled,'' the Nova Scotia actor said, repeating lines from a Molson Canadian beer commercial that has become a nationalist mantra for 30 million Canadians this spring.</p>
        <p>Addressing an invisible American audience, ''Joe Canadian'' patiently continued his lesson: ''I have a prime minister, not a president. I speak English and French, not American.''</p>
        <p>''I can proudly sew my country's flag on my backpack,'' he said, uttering patriotic lines that now are recited in bars and high school hallways from Vancouver to Halifax. ''I believe in peacekeeping, not policing; diversity, not assimilation.''</p>
        <p>By now the television version is flashing images of maple leaves and beavers as Joe Canadian reaches his climax, bellowing: ''Canada is the second-largest land mass, the first nation of hockey and the best part of North America. My name is Joe and I am Canadian.''</p>
        <p>Canadian hockey teams struck out in the Stanley Cup for a record-breaking seventh year in a row, the Canadian dollar is stuck at two-thirds of the United States dollar, a southern brain drain is cherry-picking this year's crop of college graduates, but Canadians have found a powerful spine-stiffening elixir: a nationalistic beer commercial.</p>
        <p>Tired of being measured against the eternal American yardstick, Canadians are doing something uncharacterically Canadian: beating their chests with patriotism.</p>
        <p>The Rant, as the 60-second commercial is known, has won cheers in movie theaters, endless debate on talk radio, fist-pumping ovations by fans at National Hockey League games and 14,000 e-mail messages to a special Web site created by Molson, www.iam.ca.</p>
        <p>''We were taken aback by how much it struck a chord with everybody,'' said Paul Thomson, a Molson spokesman, who quickly put the ''Joe Canadian'' actor on a national tour of hockey rinks. ''There was a lot of Canadian pride that was below the surface, exploding the myth that young adult Canadians are not proud of their country.''</p>
        <p>At Schanks Athletic Club, the sports bar here, Kim Anderson said of the ad, ''It's kind of neat for him to yell it out,'' though adding, ''After all, everything here is American.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, in a nation with the highest level of foreign economic ownership in the developed world -- 23 percent of company assets -- the beer-drinking patrons of Schanks were sitting in the electronic wash of ESPN.</p>
        <p>From British Columbia, long a liberal bastion, Lisa McCaskill, a sales manager, said, ''I saw it in a movie theater in Vancouver, and people were cheering -- real patriots.''</p>
        <p>Glen Hunt, 35, a Toronto advertising executive, wrote the ad after returning to Canada last fall from a three-year stint in New York.</p>
        <p>''We sent people out on the street to see how young people felt about being Canadian,'' said Mr. Hunt, a creative director for Bensimon Byrne D'Arcy. ''They started pretty quiet, but once they got going it was a dormant volcano ready to erupt.</p>
        <p>At the same time, this flag-waving surge has collided with two forces that historically have deflated chest-pumping patriotism here: English Canada's cutting humor and the nation's unity-defying regionalism.</p>
        <p>''I can proudly sew my country's flag on my backpack,'' Mark Steyn, a National Post newspaper columnist, wrote recently. ''That's because even though I am a beer-guzzling hockey fan, I took sewing classes in Canada's non-gender-stereotyping school system.''</p>
        <p>He noted that many Canadians feel squeamish about reciting the national oath of allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II. On one hand, they gripe, pledging allegiance seems so American. On the other hand, swearing allegiance to the queen seems so British. Mr. Steyn concluded: ''If you drink enough Molson, eventually even Canada makes sense.''</p>
        <p>In a country where east-west links are tenuous, comedians quickly deconstructed The Rant into a series of regional mini-rants.</p>
        <p>From this western province, an ''I am Albertan'' parody hails John Deere for making ''the best hats'' and then rants, ''I speak flawless English and gripe to the store manager about French labels on cereal boxes.''</p>
        <p>From Quebec an English-language radio station aired this satire that contradicted any notion of unity there: ''I believe in language police, not equal rights,'' the announcer says in a heavy French accent. ''I believe Club Supersex is an appropriate place for my wife and I to celebrate our anniversaire.''</p>
        <p>''The land where everybody is shacking up and the legal drinking age is just a suggestion,'' he continues. ''Je m'appelle Guy -- and I am not Canadien.''</p>
        <p>From Newfoundland a regional rant concludes: ''Newfoundland is the second island province, the first nation of drinking and the best party in North America! My name is Baz, and I am Newfie!''</p>
        <p>Despite the inability of some Canadians to take patriotism seriously, The Rant is believed to have prompted the government of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, to announce that starting in September, each student will start the day by standing at attention, singing the national anthem, ''O Canada,'' and pledging allegiance to the queen.</p>
        <p>Here in Alberta, governing Conservative Party lawmakers are considering legislation that would require schoolchildren to sing ''O Canada'' at least weekly. In Quebec, which has been governed by the separatist Parti Quebecois since 1994, Canadian symbols like the national flag and anthem are officially ignored and Molson Canadian is not marketed.</p>
        <p>The new nationalist mood has won applause in Ottawa, the national capital.</p>
        <p>''Someone has decided nationalism sells,'' Charles Gordon, a columnist for The Ottawa Citizen wrote approvingly in Maclean's magazine. ''If that's true, it's good. It means that a unique culture, in art and music and theater and writing, can survive in this country, survive in the face of a powerful culture pouring over our border every day.''</p>
        <p>Recently, Canada's heritage minister, Sheila Copps, went to Boston and showed the commercial to an International Press Institute panel, ''American Culture -- the People's Choice or a Form of Imperialism?''</p>
        <p>But unless a giddy new nationalism can really bubble out of a beer commercial, The Globe and Mail of Toronto offered this sobering cup of expresso. A few years ago the Charles R. Bronfman Foundation, a private cultural group, tried to spoon-feed history to the Canadian masses with a series called ''Heritage Minutes.''</p>
        <p>''All they sparked,'' the newspaper editorialist recalled, ''was a series of parodies on the Comedy Network called 'Sacrilege Moments,' financed by -- wait for it -- Molson.''</p>
