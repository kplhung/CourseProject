        <p>St. Anthony's of South Huntington, N.Y., completed a sweep of six Catholic High Schools Athletic Association boys' and girls' team titles this academic year yesterday. The Friars captured the C.H.S.A.A. cross-country, indoor and outdoor titles in each division.</p>
        <p>But it wasn't easy for them yesterday at St. John's in Queens. The boys' team finished in a tie with its Long Island rival, Chaminade of Mineola, for the 74th annual C.H.S.A.A. outdoor crown. Chaminade earned the tie at 36 points when it finished second in the 4x400-meter relay, the final event, and the Friars were fifth. St. Anthony's was defending champion while Chaminade had won the two previous years.</p>

        <p>St. Anthony's of South Huntington, N.Y., completed a sweep of six Catholic High Schools Athletic Association boys' and girls' team titles this academic year yesterday. The Friars captured the C.H.S.A.A. cross-country, indoor and outdoor titles in each division.</p>
        <p>But it wasn't easy for them yesterday at St. John's in Queens. The boys' team finished in a tie with its Long Island rival, Chaminade of Mineola, for the 74th annual C.H.S.A.A. outdoor crown. Chaminade earned the tie at 36 points when it finished second in the 4x400-meter relay, the final event, and the Friars were fifth. St. Anthony's was defending champion while Chaminade had won the two previous years.</p>
        <p>The girls' competition was almost as close with St. Anthony's winning the title on the strength of a first in the 4x800 relay, one of the final events. The Long Island school won with 44 points to 41 by the runner-up, St. Francis Prep of Queens, which has won more times than any other school in this meet.</p>
        <p>Laurin Kilduff of St. Francis was responsible for 17 of her school's total points. She was first in the high jump and triple jump and second in the 400 meters. Pilar Marin led St. Anthony's with firsts in the 1,500 meters (4 minutes 48.3 seconds) and 3,000 (10:34.6).</p>
        <p>Standouts among the boys were Ron Hussey of Mount St. Michael in the Bronx and Carlos Bedoya of Archbishop Stepinac in White Plains.</p>
        <p>Hussey won both sprints, the 100 in 10.6 seconds and the 200 in 21.7. Bedoya, the national indoor 200 titleholder, won the 400 in 47.8 seconds.</p>
