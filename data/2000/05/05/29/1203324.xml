        <p>When will music aficionados stop worrying about the state of America's soul? The genre, that is, not the divine spirit, although many think the former lacks a sufficient amount of the latter. Soul music became mechanical in the 1980's, as name producers trotted out myriad faceless groups. But the soul renaissance is now in full force, and it's time to stop trumpeting the saviors and just listen.</p>
        <p>A case in point is Lucy Pearl, which made its debut on May 21 and played again on Tuesday at S.O.B.'s. With Raphael Saadiq, formerly of Toni! Tony! Tone!, leading the band along with Dawn Robinson, once of En Vogue, and Ali Shaheed Muhammad, erzatz D.J. for a Tribe Called Quest, this is as super as a supergroup gets. In Lucy Pearl, each member aims to push further artistically than their stellar former projects allowed.</p>

        <p>When will music aficionados stop worrying about the state of America's soul? The genre, that is, not the divine spirit, although many think the former lacks a sufficient amount of the latter. Soul music became mechanical in the 1980's, as name producers trotted out myriad faceless groups. But the soul renaissance is now in full force, and it's time to stop trumpeting the saviors and just listen.</p>
        <p>A case in point is Lucy Pearl, which made its debut on May 21 and played again on Tuesday at S.O.B.'s. With Raphael Saadiq, formerly of Toni! Tony! Tone!, leading the band along with Dawn Robinson, once of En Vogue, and Ali Shaheed Muhammad, erzatz D.J. for a Tribe Called Quest, this is as super as a supergroup gets. In Lucy Pearl, each member aims to push further artistically than their stellar former projects allowed.</p>
        <p>But innovation is not the only point of neo-soul. Augmented by a funky seven-piece band, Lucy Pearl offered hearty rhythm-and-blues focusing on time-tested themes like jealous love and lustful romance. The hourlong set, repeated both nights, stressed potential hits from the group's eponymous debut on Pookey/Beyond Records. The group's new single is a case in point. ''I want to dance tonight,/I want to toast tonight,/I'll spend my money tonight,/I want to get freaky tonight,'' Mr. Saadiq sang, stating the immortal creed of the party people.</p>
        <p>Lucy Pearl's strength is in its execution of these truisms. Mr. Mohammed's samples and turntable scratching collude with Mr. Saadiq's guitar, bass and vocals, fusing the warm outreach of the soul man with the cool pose of the hip-hop player. Ms. Robinson adds a diva's glamour and sass, and the all-too-rare mix of male and female voices lends new perspective. Soul's standard parts get an attentive tuneup.</p>
        <p>Live, Lucy Pearl's machine is still finding its track. The band fumbled some cues on the first night, and Ms. Robinson complained of hoarseness. By Tuesday, the group had jelled, connecting fully with the audience. But the set list dwelled too much on the trio's former projects. Lucy Pearl's album has songs as strong as those old crowd pleasers. Soon the band should be able to stress its new classics over the old ones.</p>
