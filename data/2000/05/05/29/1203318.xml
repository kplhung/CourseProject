        <p>Fox executives are hoping that the Internet can do for junk TV what eBay did for junk: make it a hot commodity.</p>
        <p>Last winter, the network disavowed programs like ''When Good Pets Go Bad and ''World's Scariest Police Chases'' after the mother of the genre, ''Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' became a considerable embarrassment.</p>
        <p>But reality programming will again emerge under the Fox banner this fall, when the network begins TooHotForFox.com, a Web site displaying clips from the specials now banned from the TV network.</p>
        <p>They will be listed under different subject headings, like ''Pets Gone Bad'' and ''Police Chases,'' said Jon Richmond, president of Fox's digital media division. The site will also include some newly produced segments.</p>
        <p>TooHotForFox will represent one of the bolder uses of the Internet by a major broadcast network. Ever since cable became nearly ubiquitous, broadcast executives have complained that they are at a disadvantage because they are so heavily scrutinized and, thus, restricted in what they can show.</p>
        <p>With the Web site, Fox is in essence creating a new kind of channel where its very popular reality programming can live beyond the scrutiny reserved for the networks, lost in the clutter of lurid Web sites.</p>
        <p>''We realized it would be a great testing ground for things like viewer choice, where you can program your own reality experience,'' Mr. Richmond said. ''We felt TooHotForFox would be a great test tube for what the future of narrowband and broadband content might look like.''</p>
