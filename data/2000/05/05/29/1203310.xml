        <p>Four of the country's best women's teams began semifinal play yesterday in Raleigh, N.C., to select the American representatives in the world championships to be played in August in Maastricht, the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>A foursome headed by Cheri Bjerkan of Elmhurst, Ill., faced Petra Hamman of Dallas and her team in one match. In the other, Lynn Baker of Austin, Tex., and her team opposed Gail Greenberg of Manhattan and her group.</p>
        <p>The Greenberg team, which includes Jacqui Mitchell, Irina Levitina, Stasha Cohen, Judi Radin and Sylvia Moss, is the most experienced in the field. All except Moss have won world titles, and she came close two years ago.</p>
        <p>Mitchell and Greenberg have, after a 19-year hiatus, resumed a partnership that was very successful in national and world competition. They were North and South on the diagramed deal and reached a normal four-spade contract. A trump lead would have been best, but West chose the obvious club queen.</p>
        <p>South won with the club ace and led a diamond. West put up the king, guarding against the possibility that South's suit was headed by Q-J-10, and now led the spade seven. The declarer captured the queen with the ace, ruffed a diamond and cashed the heart ace. She then ruffed a heart, ruffed a second diamond and ruffed another heart. The position was now this:</p>
        <p>(Diagram)</p>
        <p>At this point Greenberg had seven tricks and could not be prevented from making three more when she led another diamond. West ruffed to keep the spade nine from scoring, and South threw a club from the dummy. A heart would have been equally effective. West's heart return was ruffed, and the last diamond insured that the spade nine would score the 10th trick.</p>
        <p>The same contract failed in the replay, and the Greenberg team gained 10 imps.</p>
