        <p>France Telecom is planning to announce tomorrow that it has agreed to acquire Orange P.L.C., Britain's third-largest wireless phone operator, from Vodafone AirTouch for more than $37 billion, executives close to the negotiations said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The sale would conclude one of the most highly anticipated deals in Europe, which was supposed to attract bidders from around the world.</p>
        <p>As part of its blockbuster acquisition of Mannesmann A.G., the German industrial and telecommunications conglomerate, in early February, Vodafone was required to sell Orange to appease regulators.</p>
        <p>Telecommunications companies in Europe and even some in the United States seeking to establish a foothold in Britain's lucrative wireless market expressed interest in Orange, but the expected auction never came.</p>
        <p>Instead, France Telecom, which had been talking to Vodafone even before its acquisition of Mannesmann was completed, fired the first, final and only shot for Orange before its rivals could arrive at the table with an offer.</p>
        <p>According to the executives close to the talks, France Telecom will pay about 40 billion euros in cash and stock, or $37.4 billion. It will also assume about 10 billion euros, or $9.4 billion, in debt. Vodafone, which will announce its 1999 earnings tomorrow, will hold about a 10 percent stake of nonvoting shares in the French company, though it may eventually have to dispose of its new stake to placate regulators.</p>
        <p>For France Telecom, the acquisition of Orange vaults it into the upper echelon of European telecommunications competitors, giving it substantial reach beyond its own borders. Orange has six million customers in Britain plus alliances and other licensing arrangements across Europe.</p>
        <p>With the purchase of Orange, France Telecom would obtain a universal mobile telecommunications system license to offer fast Internet access on cellular phones. In April, a British subsidiary of NTL of New York, backed by France Telecom, withdrew from the bidding.</p>
        <p>The deal would put France Telecom in direct competition in Britain with Vodafone, the largest wireless operator in the world; as well as with British Telecommunications, which operates BT Cellnet; Deutsche Telekom, which owns One2One; and TIW UMTS Ltd., which is owned in part by the Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, another recent winner of a so-called third-generation wireless license. Hutchison had owned a majority stake in Orange before it was acquired by Mannesmann in October, which set off the entire series of acquisitions.</p>
        <p>France Telecom plans to merge Orange with its own wireless unit, which includes Itineris, the largest wireless company in France, which has more than 10 million subscribers and operations in Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Austria and Switzerland. It will then spin off the combined company within a year, executives close to the negotiations said, adding that Hans Snook, chief executive of Orange, would run the new company. Mr. Snook had initially been opposed to selling the company directly to a competitor but has since become amenable to the deal, the executives said.</p>
        <p>Vodafone's sale of Orange directly to a rival is a reversal of its original plan to spin off Orange and sell shares to the public.</p>
        <p>In part, the sale comes as a result of the recent spate of high-revenue auctions across Europe for the third-generation wireless licenses -- for mobile phones that may include Web browsing and video conferences. Vodafone recently paid $9.42 billion for a license in Britain and is competing for similar licenses across the Continent. The higher-than-expected license fees have forced Vodafone to try to raise cash. And amid plunging telecommunications share prices generally, the company's stock has sharply fallen since its acquisition of Mannesmann, a deal valued at the time around $183 billion. On Friday, Vodafone shares closed here at $:2.8125, down from $:3.855 in February.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, Vodafone said it would sell its entire stake in Cegetel, a French phone company, to its partner Vivendi. Vodafone had earlier said it would sell 7.5 percent of Mannesmann's stake in Cegetel, but it decided to sell the whole stake -- 15 percent -- to raise more cash. Vodafone also sold Mannesmann's engineering and automotive unit, Atecs, for 9.6 billion euros to the German companies Siemens and Robert Bosch in April.</p>
        <p>To support its acquisition of Orange, France Telecom is also going on a selling spree to raise cash. It said on Friday that it would sell most of its stake in Telefonos de Mexico to raise $1.9 billion. Telmex said it planned to buy the remaining stake for $600 million.</p>
        <p>Vodafone is being advised on the deal by Goldman, Sachs; Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette; Dresdner Kleinwort Benson; and UBS Warburg. France Telecom is being advised by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Credit Suisse First Boston and N. M. Rothschild.</p>
