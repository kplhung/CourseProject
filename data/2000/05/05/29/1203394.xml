        <p>The Devils consider themselves very similar to the Dallas Stars, their opponent in the Stanley Cup finals that begin here Tuesday night. Both teams have proven goaltenders, solid defenses and explosive forwards. But the Stars are the defending champions and have more experienced veterans.</p>
        <p>Dallas also defeated the Devils the two times they met in the regular season, but the playoffs are different. Just ask the St. Louis Blues, who finished the regular season with the best record in the league and took the first exit in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''The regular season doesn't mean a thing,'' said Alexander Mogilny, who scored three goals against the Stars as a member of the Vancouver Canucks before joining the Devils hours before the trading deadline in March. ''I don't even remember who I scored against,'' Mogilny said when asked whether he scored against the Stars' Ed Belfour.</p>
        <p>''They have great goaltending, mobile defense and guys who can score,'' Mogilny said. ''I think we have all those things, too.''</p>
        <p>The Devils finished the regular season with 103 points to 102 for the Stars. They both have playoff records of 12-5. The Devils eliminated Florida, Toronto and Philadelphia, while the Stars eliminated Edmonton, San Jose and Colorado.</p>
        <p>Because they finished with 1 point more than than the Stars in the regular season, the Devils have the home advantage, but they have a better record on the road (7-2) than at home (5-3) in these playoffs. The Stars are 9-1 at home and 3-4 on the road.</p>
        <p>Martin Brodeur's and Belfour's playoff statistics are very similar. Both have played every minute in goal for their teams in the tournament.</p>
        <p>Brodeur has allowed 30 goals to 31 for Belfour, who has the edge in save percentage, .931 to .923.</p>
        <p>Belfour has played 125 games in the playoffs and has a record of 73-47.</p>
        <p>''Eddie is an excellent goalie with a lot of success in his career,'' Brodeur said. ''He gives his team a chance to win every game.''</p>
        <p>Those are the precise words that others use about Brodeur, who has played 78 games in the playoffs with a record of 46-32. Each has won the Stanley Cup once, Belfour last year and Brodeur in 1995.</p>
        <p>One slight edge the Devils may have against the Stars is an extra day's rest. The Devils completed their physical seven-game series against the Flyers on Friday after rallying from a 3-1 deficit, while the Stars edged Colorado in Game 7 Saturday night in Dallas. The Stars flew to New Jersey today, while the Devils practiced for an hour this afternoon.</p>
        <p>Most of the Devils said they preferred Dallas as an opponent because of the high altitude they would have had to deal with in Denver.</p>
        <p>''I would have trouble breathing in Colorado,''  John Madden said. ''From that standpoint, Dallas is probably better. For us, it doesn't matter. We have to play our game. We cannot count on Marty to hold up from beginning to end.''</p>
        <p>When Coach Larry Robinson was asked about his Devils' chances against the Stars, he said,  ''Fifty-fifty.'' Most of his players echoed his sentiment, but some went a little further.</p>
        <p>''Larry told us that if we put our minds to it we can do it,'' Sergei Brylin said. ''We did it with Philly and we believe we can do it.''</p>
        <p>The Devils' advancement to the finals has been credited in part to Robinson's tirade after a loss in Game 4 against the Flyers.</p>
        <p>''This speech has been blown out of proportion, and I want to put an end to it,'' Robinson said. ''It's not me who has done anything here, it's the players on the ice.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>SERGEI NEMCHINOV practiced Sunday and will play Tuesday after missing the last two games against the Flyers with a cut to his forehead that required 40 stitches.</p>
