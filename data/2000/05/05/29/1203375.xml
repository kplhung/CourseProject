        <p>Jeff Van Gundy is used to getting the knock on the office door from an unsatisfied player with the latest complaint about minutes or shots or both. But he did not expect the knock to come from Chris Dudley.</p>
        <p>While Van Gundy, the Knicks' coach, praised Dudley for being ready when the little-used center was pressed into the starting lineup for Game 3 on Saturday, it did not surprise him. Before the start of the series, Dudley went to Van Gundy and told him he was prepared to play. Van Gundy, unaware that his big men would start dropping so steadily that he would wind up playing power forward himself in today's practice, had sympathy, but little else, to offer Dudley at the time.</p>

        <p>Jeff Van Gundy is used to getting the knock on the office door from an unsatisfied player with the latest complaint about minutes or shots or both. But he did not expect the knock to come from Chris Dudley.</p>
        <p>While Van Gundy, the Knicks' coach, praised Dudley for being ready when the little-used center was pressed into the starting lineup for Game 3 on Saturday, it did not surprise him. Before the start of the series, Dudley went to Van Gundy and told him he was prepared to play. Van Gundy, unaware that his big men would start dropping so steadily that he would wind up playing power forward himself in today's practice, had sympathy, but little else, to offer Dudley at the time.</p>
        <p>''I told him that I appreciate his work, but I can't promise him anything,'' Van Gundy said. ''I'm not a promiser.''</p>
        <p>Besides, Van Gundy said: ''I like the eight that we play. It just so worked out, he goes from not playing to starting.''</p>
        <p>Dudley had played less than a minute in each of the previous two rounds of the playoffs, and he had played little more than that in the final six weeks of the regular season.</p>
        <p>Van Gundy said he admired the way Dudley handled not playing.</p>
        <p>''He's not a high-maintenance guy, so you don't have to sit there and stroke him all the time,'' Van Gundy said. ''Chris never ever did anything less than professionally.''</p>
        <p>Dudley, who signed a four-year, $28 million deal with the Knicks two years ago, was willing to wait his turn to play, but at 35 years old, the wait was getting difficult to take. But he worked, practicing through the pain of a bad back and a sore knee.</p>
        <p>''It's something that, you don't want to be in that situation,'' Dudley said of trying to keep ready. ''I take pride in being professional. If I'm not playing, I'm not happy about it, but I'm still going to stay ready.''</p>
        <p>Last year, Dudley stepped in and started six postseason games in Patrick Ewing's place. On Saturday, he found himself getting the word less than two hours before the start of Game 3 that he would be starting.</p>
        <p>Dudley provided a steady defensive hand against Pacers center Rik Smits in 25 minutes and even sank a pair of free throws that pulled the Knicks even early in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>He spent time after practice today working on his free throws -- he is a 46 percent career free-throw shooter -- and taking one-on-one tutelage from the assistant coach Brendan Malone on how to deny Smits the ball in the post, hoping he will be more prepared for Game 4 on Monday. But he was uncertain whether he would get the call again. ''I'll know 20 minutes before the game,'' Dudley said. ''With Pat, I think he'll do everything possible to play.''</p>
        <p>Dudley planned to be ready, just in case.</p>
        <p>Wallace Is Ready, Too</p>
        <p>Like Chris Dudley, John Wallace has waited through more games without playing than he would care to recall. His chance came in Game 2 against the Pacers when he entered in the second quarter for his first postseason action this year.</p>
        <p>Four minutes later, he was back on the bench after contributing little, and he has remained there since. But with the Knicks' injuries piling up and the possibility that Latrell Sprewell could be sidelined for Game 4, Wallace was considering the improbable circumstances that could put him in the starting lineup.</p>
        <p>''I'm definitely ready,'' said Wallace, who earned points today by playing alongside Jeff Van Gundy in the team's scrimmage. ''It's easy for me to sit here and tell you I'm ready, but I've got to go out there and give my teammates something, as opposed to the last time, when I didn't give them anything.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''You couldn't tell from the way I played last time, but I was ready. I didn't go in there and play like I was ready, but I was ready.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dependable</p>
        <p>Larry Johnson pointed to Charlie Ward sitting alone after practice and joked that Ward was the healthiest player on the Knicks' roster. Ward had 14 points, 9 assists and 4 rebounds in Game 3.</p>
        <p>''You take what you can,'' Ward said. ''Being a role player, that's the way it is. I do my job and try to do the best I can. I did this last year. Everyone's looking at the scoring numbers, but I've always done this.''</p>
