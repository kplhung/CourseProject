        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article about salary increases at law firms (Business Day, May 22) neglects one of the most disturbing potential consequences: a decline in the pro bono activities of firm lawyers. The nation's larger law firms have traditionally played a central role in providing legal assistance to the poor and disadvantaged. Concerns about maintaining firm profitability could certainly put a damper on volunteer work if law firms do not aggressively support pro bono work.</p>

        <p>Your article about salary increases at law firms (Business Day, May 22) neglects one of the most disturbing potential consequences: a decline in the pro bono activities of firm lawyers. The nation's larger law firms have traditionally played a central role in providing legal assistance to the poor and disadvantaged. Concerns about maintaining firm profitability could certainly put a damper on volunteer work if law firms do not aggressively support pro bono work.</p>
        <p>All firms should follow the example of several of the nation's largest leading law firms and reward volunteer work by counting pro bono hours toward billable hour benchmarks and eligibility for bonus pay. If not, in abandoning pro bono, lawyers and law firms will divest themselves of the core value that makes the law a profession and not simply a bottom-line business.</p>
