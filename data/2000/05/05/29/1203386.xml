        <p>Internet Transforms East Asia  From Taiwan to Thailand, the region's most powerful families have started a blizzard of online ventures. Asia's tycoons are seizing on the Internet in hopes of expanding their reach and making even more money. In the process, the Internet is transforming the way business is done throughout the region.</p>

        <p>President of Israel to Resign  President Ezer Weizman of Israel, denounced for financial misdealings, will resign on July 10, his spokeswoman said, putting a scandal-tainted end to what had been one of the most distinguished careers in Israeli public life.</p>

        <p>Israel-Lebanon Border Violence  Israeli soldiers fired on Lebanese and Palestinian civilians who were throwing stones and trying to push across the border from what was until last week the Israeli-controlled buffer zone between the two countries. Four people were wounded.</p>

        <p>Senior Palestinian officials, speaking outside their weekly cabinet meeting, said they expected that peace talks -- suspended by Israel last week in protest of anti-Israeli violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip -- would resume in the next few days.</p>

        <p>Credit for Improving the U.N.  The United States General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, has said in a surprisingly positive report on the United Nations that the administration of Secretary General Kofi Annan has made considerable strides in improving management of the organization.</p>

        <p>Civil Rights March in Australia  More than 200,000 people, a crowd larger than any expected at the Olympics in Australia in September, marched to support campaigns for social justice for the country's black minority. The largest civil rights gathering in Australian history clogged Sydney and forced the police to close much of the city to traffic for up to eight hours.</p>

        <p>Poland Government Imperiled  The junior party in Poland's center-right governing coalition voted to withdraw its ministers, which will probably cause the collapse of the two-and-a-half-year-old government of Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek. The party, Freedom Union, was unhappy with Mr. Buzek's inability to control maverick lawmakers from his own Solidarity bloc.</p>

        <p>Leone Rebels Free Hostages  Liberian and United Nations officials said they believed that Sierra Leone rebels had released the remaining hostages among some 500 United Nations peacekeepers who were captured earlier this month.</p>

        <p>Blighted Areas Are Revived As Crime Drop Takes Hold  Cities across the country are being transformed as neighborhoods that had become frightening wastelands are showing glimmers of renaissance, with the historic drop in violent crime beginning to take hold in even the most blighted areas.</p>

        <p>Crime in New York City remains at a 30-year low, but officials have been trying to allay fears that the city may be headed back to the days when more than 1,500 homicides a year were not uncommon.</p>

        <p>Texans Fight Over Oil Cleanup  Ranchers and oil producers are fighting over cleaning up a less glamorous legacy of the high-flying days when oil was king. There are 25,000 abandoned oil wells in Texas, an additional 15,000 sitting idle and tens of thousands of others that could be leaking.</p>

        <p>Briefing Bush on Security  Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, left, invited Gov. George W. Bush and his national security advisers to the Pentagon for a briefing on the nation's strategic nuclear arsenal after criticizing Mr. Bush's recent pledge to reduce the number of American nuclear warheads.</p>

        <p>Step Toward Missile Defense  An Air Force rocket built of scrapped missiles was successfully launched yesterday at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. The rocket, intended to be used in creating a missile defense system, was made of three stages from Minuteman II missiles, including one built in 1966, a base spokesman said. The launching was a test of whether such a rocket could be used as a cheaper target for interceptor missiles. It cost $11 million, compared with $21 million for a regular Minuteman II.</p>

        <p>Deficiencies in Care of Dying  Millions of Americans have signed living wills and power-of-attorney documents, thinking the papers would help them avoid unwanted treatment and prolonged deaths, but in many cases those measures turn out to be useless. The failure of these advance directives is just one symptom of a much larger problem in the care of people who are dying.</p>

        <p>Stricter Hand Rules At Greener Central Park  New York City is getting fussy about Central Park after having spent $250 million on it, turning the dust bowls of a few years ago into luxurious carpets. In enforcing long-ignored rules, the city is posting signs about littering and ordering the park's musicians and dancers to lower the volume and perform less often.</p>

        <p>Two Arraigned in Massacre  Two men facing an avalanche of evidence in a case that could lead to the death penalty were arraigned in a Queens court on murder and robbery charges in last week's execution-style massacre at a Wendy's restaurant that left five workers slain and two others shot and left for dead.</p>

        <p>Lazio's Plan Revived  A failed plan to let thousands of disabled New Yorkers stay on Medicaid even after getting jobs, is suddenly very much alive again. Governor Pataki's office had balked at the cost, and the plan was dropped, apparently dead for the year. But it now stands a good chance of approval because its primary author is Representative Rick A. Lazio, the new Senate candidate.</p>

        <p>Bibliographies on Reserve  Bibliographies, the traditional structural support system for an author's work, have been severed from books and moved to Web sites, in a growing number of instances involving both trade publishers and prominent academic publishers. The advantage, the publishers say, is a smaller, cheaper, more accessible book.</p>

        <p>Music Label Loses a Champion  Joseph R. Dalton, the 37-year-old executive director of the independent boutique label C.R.I., left his position on Friday, saying that he planned to take a few months off before deciding what to do next.</p>

        <p>Middleware as a Challenger  One of the most remarkable byproducts of the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft is that a nerdish bit of computer plumbing called middleware has emerged as the star of the case and a focus of public-policy debate in the Internet age.</p>

        <p>Lucent Looks to Buy Chromatis  Lucent Technologies, North America's No. 1 maker of communications equipment, is in negotiations to acquire Chromatis Networks for as much as $5.5 billion in stock, people close to the companies said.</p>
