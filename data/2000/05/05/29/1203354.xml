        <p>As a sign of spring, it ranks well below the sprouting of the tulips or the lengthening of the ice cream lines. But each year when the weather warms, officers from the Central Park Precinct can be spotted pedaling the pathways of the 843-acre park on bicycle patrol.</p>
        <p>Anyone who thinks the job is about as taxing as, well, a day in the park, has not been trained by Sgt. Tara Murphy. In a three-day course, she teaches officers the sort of bike-riding skills and stunts that would have gotten them into trouble as children.</p>
        <p>One-legged dismounts. Power slides. How to go down stairs.</p>
        <p>''We have to be able to recreational ride while on patrol,'' said Sergeant Murphy, who has been training officers since 1996. ''But we also have to be able to go to a crime in progress and apprehend a criminal without hurting ourselves. And we have equipment on, like guns and vests and belts, that we have to be able to get to even while we are riding the bike.''</p>
        <p>All that takes a level of agility with the bicycle, Sergeant Murphy said, that goes beyond what is normally acquired by the Sunday rider.</p>
        <p>This month, for the first time, the Central Park officers were trained in the park itself instead of at the bicycle training center at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn. The instructors think that the park terrain, with its abrupt changes in elevation, narrow corners and unpaved paths, is unique and requires a training session that orients the riders to the topography.</p>
        <p>Bicycles, which are used for patrol across the city by some 2,000 officers, are particularly useful in Central Park, where the same nooks and crannies that give the place its charm can become impossible obstacles to an officer pursuing in a car, officials said. The precinct has 30 officers trained in the use of bikes, and usually puts 8 to 12 on patrol during the day.</p>
        <p>''Without bikes, there would be areas of the park that would be patrolled very infrequently,'' said Capt. James O'Neill, the precinct commander. ''Even on the paved roads, on a crowded day, it is virtually  impossible to bring a patrol car down the drives.''</p>
        <p>In addition to teaching agility skills, the training course offers lessons on bicycle safety and maintenance, how to use the bicycle as a shield (keep the bike between you and the suspect), how to pedal efficiently, and a tip that is a blessing for even the most athletic riders: how to adjust the seat for comfort during long hours of patrolling.</p>
