        <p>One of the dead young men, on a southern Eritrean slope of shattered stones and soldiers' bodies, left behind the start of a journal. He was born on Oct. 5, 1980. His father died when he was young, so he moved in with an uncle. They did not get along. His grades were good.</p>
        <p>He learned something about life working in a market near Nazret, Ethiopia, where he grew up, he wrote in English, one of the languages used in his country.</p>
        <p>''There are so many kinds of man,'' he wrote in a notebook with a cover picture of Leonardo DiCaprio on the Titanic. ''For example, the person who is a thief.'' Cattle traders and laborers are better, he said.</p>
        <p>He wrote nothing about the war that killed him, but then again he only got two pages through his life. He was one of at least 24 dead Ethiopians near the town of Adi Keshi in southern Eritrea, cut down in battle six days ago. There were said to be many more bodies, but it was too dangerous around a jagged bend, and who had the stomach to look anyway.</p>
        <p>On Monday, senior officials from Ethiopia and Eritrea are to meet in Algeria, to talk about ending a two-year war that has killed tens of thousands of young men like this one and,  here in Eritrea, women serving as soldiers too. After a two-week offensive by Ethiopia, Eritrea agreed last week to pull back from the border territory both countries claim -- paving the way, in theory, for peace.</p>
        <p>But this war, which has perplexed the outside world with the ferocity of the fight between brother nations on the Horn of Africa, has become only more complex in recent days. Despite Eritrea's retreat, Ethiopia shows no signs of stopping the fight, continuing its push into southern Eritrea. Only this morning, an Ethiopian warplane reportedly bombed what officials said was a new power plant near the Eritrean port city of Massawa, far from the border.</p>
        <p>Ethiopian officials say they will not end the war until a final peace accord is signed and they themselves have verified that Eritrea has left the last of the land that Ethiopia  claims. Ethiopia maintains that it was invaded two years ago and has made no secret of its desire to punish Eritrea for that.</p>
        <p>Eritreans, meantime, say they do not know what else to give up but vow to keep fighting until Ethiopians leave the territory they have captured in the last two weeks, indisputably Eritrea's.</p>
        <p>''We will fight to the last, and still we are fighting,'' said Mehari Gebrehiwet, 39, a teacher in the southern Eritrean town of Mendefera, surrounded on three sides by fighting. Still, he despaired: ''It's a meaningless war. Meaningless loss of lives. It diminishes the economies of both countries.''</p>
        <p>''War,'' he added, ''cannot be a solution.''</p>
        <p>The likelihood of finding peace at the talks in Algeria this week seems remote -- especially since the two nations had already agreed on all but the fine print of a peace deal brokered by the Organization of African Unity, but still went on with this latest round of fighting.</p>
        <p>''I want to be an optimist,'' said one Western diplomat here, who did not sound very optimistic. His conversation today was interrupted twice in several minutes with phone calls about the Ethiopian bombing near Massawa.</p>
        <p>The war between Ethiopia and Eritrea began in May 1998, after months of skirmishes along a 620-mile border that was never officially marked off. Since then, the war has taken on significance greater than a mere border spat. These are two proud nations: Eritrea, born only in 1993 after a 30-year struggle against two regimes in Ethiopia, and Ethiopia, with a strong sense of its 3,000-year history of repelling invaders.</p>
        <p>Eritrea is tiny -- with only 3.5 million people to Ethiopia's 63 million -- but its long struggle has defined it as a nation of fighters. And during the two years of war, it has held its own.</p>
        <p>But Eritrea has had the worse of it since Ethiopia began its new offensive on May 12, saying it wanted a quick end to the war that has cost so much money and so many lives. First, Ethiopia captured large areas of Eritrean territory to the west. Then on Thursday, Eritrea pulled back from the central front, south of Asmara, and even said it would pull out of two towns on Ethiopia's specific request.</p>
        <p>In the face of what appears to be military defeat along the border, Eritreans seem glum but say they still support their president, Isaias Afwerki, viewed as the father of the Eritrean nation. He has portrayed the withdrawal as a ''tactical'' retreat that saves lives, in a nation with far fewer to spare than Ethiopia. And some military analysts say the Eritrean Army is far from destroyed -- though that appears to have been a prime goal of Ethiopians in this latest offensive.</p>
        <p>The turmoil here, though, is tremendous.</p>
        <p>During the last few days, as Ethiopians have continued to push north, towns and villages, some less than 30 miles south of the capital here, are emptying out -- adding to the several hundred thousand people already displaced by fighting in the west. Roadsides are jammed with people, some carrying a bag or two of clothes, but many empty-handed, as they flee from the towns of Adi Keyh, Adi Quala, Mendefera, Maimine and Areza.</p>
        <p>Adi Quala, 44 miles by road from Asmara, is now deserted except for perhaps two dozen people, most of them women and children. They are living under a concrete bridge, in case of shelling. ''Where else can we go?'' said Roma Gebrekidan, a woman in her 60's who was scrunched under the bridge, waving away swarms of flies with a eucalyptus branch.</p>
        <p>For the last two days, the Eritrean government has been moving many refugees by bus and truck to the grounds of a secondary school in Dbarwa, about 12 miles north on the road toward Asmara. By today, relief officials said at least 18,000 people were there, and busloads more were still arriving early this evening. Many had slept in the open. Latrines were dug in V-shapes in front of the school buildings but so close to the crowds that people seemed too embarrassed to use them.</p>
        <p>Solomon Embaye, an official with the Eritrean Relief and Refugee Commission, who had to leave his own home, said that for the moment, officials have enough cornmeal, oil and sugar to feed the crowds who were there already. But he said the amount was ''just enough for survival.''</p>
        <p>''We don't have shelter, blankets, clothing, utensils for cooking,'' he said. ''It all came as a surprise that we have thousands of displaced people. These people came from their homes only with the clothes on their backs.''</p>
        <p>As for the fighting, the Eritrean Army seems eager to show that it has pulled back from the areas claimed by Ethiopia but that it is still intact and will fight where it suits Eritrea. On Saturday, government officials escorted reporters to Adi Keshi, just south of Adi Quala, where the young man with the journal died, apparently to demonstrate that they can hold their own.</p>
        <p>For three days, ending on Wednesday, soldiers said they repelled an advance of Ethiopian troops across a plain and up a steep slope -- well inside Eritrean territory. They said the combat was heavy, in battles through the day and night.</p>
        <p>''Their attempt was to eat breakfast here,'' said the local commander, Lt. Col. Tibabo Sium. ''It didn't happen.''</p>
        <p>But he said it was possible that they would continue to pull back deeper inside Eritrea if the Ethiopians continued to advance.</p>
        <p>''We fight on our own terms,'' he said. ''If need be, we will pull back in some areas. But we will make sure they pay a heavy price.''</p>
