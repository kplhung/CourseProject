        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The May 23 news article about the boycott of Merck &amp; Company products that has been called by the Federation of Physicians and Dentists underscores why allowing doctors to form cartels to raise prices, boycott drug companies and national health plans, and deny medical services to patients is a bad prescription for our country's health care.</p>
        <p>Inflated doctors' bills, higher premiums and fewer benefits won't help working families meet their health care needs. But that's what we'll get if Congress passes an anti-competitive bill, H.R. 1304, granting doctors the same collective bargaining rights enjoyed by unions but without government protections to prevent predatory pricing practices.</p>

        <p>Inflated doctors' bills, higher premiums and fewer benefits won't help working families meet their health care needs. But that's what we'll get if Congress passes an anti-competitive bill, H.R. 1304, granting doctors the same collective bargaining rights enjoyed by unions but without government protections to prevent predatory pricing practices.</p>
        <p>Collusion pricing is illegal under antitrust laws, and the Federal Trade Commission has recently stepped in to break up doctor cartels in Wisconsin and Texas. Do we want to repeat that experience in all 50 states?</p>
