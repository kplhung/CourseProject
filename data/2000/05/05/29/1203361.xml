        <p>The F train rattled above McDonald Avenue, tossing glints of twilight at the storefronts of Gravesend. It was another dusk in southern Brooklyn, a time when a young man's thoughts turn toward the night ahead and those of an old mob lawyer toward the nights that have already gone by.</p>
        <p>Albert C. Aronne sat at his regular table at Fiorentino's, his back to the wall and his fingers wrapped around a tumbler of Scotch. In his three-piece pinstriped suit, he sipped at his drink in little pensive draws, as if the liquor itself could resurrect the past.</p>

        <p>The F train rattled above McDonald Avenue, tossing glints of twilight at the storefronts of Gravesend. It was another dusk in southern Brooklyn, a time when a young man's thoughts turn toward the night ahead and those of an old mob lawyer toward the nights that have already gone by.</p>
        <p>Albert C. Aronne sat at his regular table at Fiorentino's, his back to the wall and his fingers wrapped around a tumbler of Scotch. In his three-piece pinstriped suit, he sipped at his drink in little pensive draws, as if the liquor itself could resurrect the past.</p>
        <p>''It all started right here on Avenue U,'' he said, gazing past the crowd that was watching a Yankees game at the bar. ''This guy I went to high school with, name of Alphonse, I helped him out of a little trouble a long while back, and over the years, he sent a lot of guys my way.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Aronne is an elegantly hard-boiled man of 77 who has been representing wise guys around the city for decades. After almost 50 years on the job, he has earned the title of Godfather of New York mob lawyers, and he can still be found in the neighborhoods today, dispensing legal advice to a roster of gangsters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aronne has harvested most of his clients from Gravesend and Bensonhurst, strongholds of the Bonanno and Colombo crime families. He was born in the area, attended Abraham Lincoln High School on Ocean Parkway and has lived for years with his wife in the house where she grew up on quiet Quentin Road.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aronne will be the first to point out that he knows every player in the Kings County legal system, from the greenest prosecutor to the grandest don.</p>
        <p>''Everybody knows Al Aronne,'' he said recently without a trace of bombast. ''I know the judges, the D.A.'s and, of course, the boyas, too. Hoof! My name's like a standard to them, they all come to me. I waltz them outta their maladies. They get themselves in trouble, and then I get them out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Aronne's career began in 1951 after he graduated from the law school at St. John's University in Queens. His father had wanted him to become an accountant, but he chose a life in criminal law instead. ''Why?'' he asked. ''Because I knew so many criminals, I guess.''</p>
        <p>Although his first case was so long ago that he cannot recall who he represented, he does remember that one of his first jobs was helping his old pal Alphonse out of a little jam.</p>
        <p>Not 30 minutes after entertaining his memories of Alphonse and the old days, Mr. Aronne looked up from his meal, set down his fork and called out, ''Ho-ohhh! Ho-ohhh!'' to a grandfatherly gentleman in a white polo shirt and oversize glasses who had just walked into the bar. It was Alphonse himself. The old friends shook hands.</p>
        <p>''How's your wife doing, Al?'' Mr. Aronne asked, as calmly as a barber waiting to cut a familiar head.</p>
        <p>Alphonse, whose last name was never revealed, seemed pained at first, then pleased by the question. ''She's recovering 10 times faster than she ought to,'' he said and paused. ''Look, Al, I'd love to talk, but, you know, there's someone I got to see.'' And with that, he disappeared into another room as Mr. Aronne shook his head and said, chuckling, ''What a guy, what-a-guy.''</p>
        <p>From his days canvassing for clients in gangland social clubs and bars, Mr. Aronne has come across plenty of other guys, many more renowned than Alphonse, he said. He tells the story of ''visiting the territory'' in Bensonhurst on Saturday afternoons and another of discussing grandchildren with John J. Gotti, the jailed Gambino family boss, in a Little Italy joint called the Hawaiian Moonlighter's Club.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aronne said he had also spent time in a bar on 18th Avenue in Bensonhurst that was once the headquarters of Salvatore Gravano, the Gambino informer and hit man better known as Sammy the Bull.</p>
        <p>One night, he recalled, Mr. Gravano asked him to take on a case for a friend for a $5,000 fee. Mr. Aronne gladly accepted, but he said the client paid only $4,500. After chasing the man for the balance for weeks, Mr. Aronne said, he went back to Mr. Gravano for some help. Days later, or so the story goes, Mr. Gravano  told the lawyer that he had secured the cash. But, as Mr. Aronne tells it, the gangster also said that he had spent the money just that night on dinner for himself and friends.</p>
        <p>''So I told Sammy, 'Lotta nerve you got having me pay for dinner and not even inviting me along,' '' Mr. Aronne recalled with a laugh. ''And trust me, that's the only thing I coulda said. Anything else might not have been appreciated.''</p>
        <p>One oddity of Mr. Aronne's practice is that he rarely appears in court for trials. Strictly a pregame lawyer, he is more interested in the give-and-take of back-room haggling than in the daily bother of courtroom harangues.</p>
        <p>''Al's style of plea bargaining starts with being indignant, as in:  'Hey, whaddya talking about!' '' said Gerald L. Shargel, a prominent lawyer whose clients have included Mr. Gotti and who has known Mr. Aronne for more than 30 years. ''I'd see these people with long criminal histories -- they've been arrested 20 or 30 times, say, and never gone to jail -- and then I figured out that the guy they had as their attorney was Al.''</p>
        <p>James M. LaRossa, another lawyer who routinely represents the mob, said Mr. Aronne had succeeded by knowing his limitations.</p>
        <p>''Most of us who are trial lawyers came through the Justice Department or the D.A.'s office in our youth,'' Mr. LaRossa said. ''Al never had that. What he has is a great street sense and a tremendous amount of moxie.''</p>
        <p>But one law enforcement official  said Mr. Aronne had failed to learn a crucial lesson about being a lawyer for the mob. ''That is, not to visit social clubs to socialize with the clients -- it is important to respect the line,'' said the official, who refused to provide his name because he might one day find himself in a courtroom with Mr. Aronne.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Aronne admits that he has been around forever -- ''Hoof! I've being doing this for a week or two'' -- he insists that he is hardly larger than life. If he is anything at all besides a lawyer, he is simply the guy who knows the guys it's good to know.</p>
        <p>''Ho-ohhh! Ho-ohhh!'' he called out again during dinner, this time to a pair of heavyset young men with ferociously ruddy suntans of the kind that come only as a result of wintering in Florida or working for a construction company.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Aronne,'' one of them said deferentially as he leaned across the table to shake hands. ''How are you feeling tonight? How's your health?''</p>
        <p>After a bit of pleasant chatter, the men moved on, greeting others and leaving Al Aronne aglow with a sort of know-your-community pride. And the men? Who are the men?</p>
        <p>''Hoof! Don't ask. There's just some things you're not supposed to know.''</p>
