        <p>The Indiana Pacers want to squeeze life from the Knicks this afternoon in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals at Madison Square Garden. If they can push a 2-1 series lead into a 3-1 advantage, the Pacers believe the Knicks could become breathless, introspective and numb.</p>
        <p>Which is how the Pacers felt after losing Game 3 at the Garden on Saturday. A three-game lead in the four-of-seven-game series was there to be swiped, the Pacers said, but they slipped.</p>
        <p>''Instead of beating up on them and taking the life out of them, we gave them life,'' Pacers forward Dale Davis said. ''And, you know, they can take a little life and make a big thing out of it. They have a history of performing some miracles.''</p>
        <p>Pacers forward Austin Croshere said: ''We always seem to bounce back when we have to. This is a game where we have to.''</p>
        <p>Pacers Coach Larry Bird talked about how his team led Game 3 by a point at halftime, during which he talked to his team about taking away the Knicks' life, bounce and spirit. He said his team could put the Knicks ''in a whole world of hurt.'' But the Knicks -- without Patrick Ewing and Marcus Camby because of injuries -- heartily inhaled and exhaled with playoff highs from Latrell Sprewell (32 points) and Allan Houston (28 points) that helped foil the Pacers.</p>
        <p>''We gave them life,'' said Bird, who canceled practice yesterday but watched film and talked strategy with his team. ''And now it's going to be a battle, a war. I've never come to Madison Square Garden and heard a crowd as soft as they were. And I'll never see it again.''</p>
        <p>That is because Bird believes the Knicks and their fans have new life.</p>
        <p>And yet both teams keep the same mission.</p>
        <p>''We are still in control of this series,'' Indiana's Jalen Rose said. ''We win two more games, and we're in the N.B.A. finals.''</p>
        <p>Davis added: ''Their heels are still against the wall. We're still the same team that got the No. 1 seed in the East.''</p>
        <p>Bird and his players must keep that as their focus. The Pacers enter Game 4 tonight pondering three key elements: How to keep a hot hand going, how to negate Sprewell and Houston and how to jolt their bench.</p>
        <p>Pacers center Rik Smits scored 21 points in the first half of Game 3 but only 4 in the second half.</p>
        <p>''Their defense was good, but I think we had a lot of guys that wanted to get involved in things and that's our offense,'' Smits said about his fancy start and dull finish. ''I have no idea this time if Patrick Ewing will play, and it really doesn't matter. We want to concentrate on us.''</p>
        <p>Actually, of course it matters. The Knicks play more halfcourt basketball with Ewing, who can give Smits trouble on both ends. Without him they are more loose on the perimeter and they run more, allowing Sprewell and Houston to slash.</p>
        <p>''If you get 21 points in the first half it is not a guaranteed blueprint to get 21 in the second,'' forward Sam Perkins said of Smits's flip-flop game. ''But you should get more touches. And when the team starts doing things that are not working, well, you just have to know the game, know your plan. That's what the Knicks did. They went to things working for them -- Sprewell and Houston -- and we didn't and couldn't stop it.''</p>
        <p>Bird said: ''Rik couldn't get a 40-point game because we stopped throwing him the ball and started moving side to side. I knew we were in trouble at the start of the second half when there were two loose balls on the floor and we didn't get either one of them. We know that Sprewell and Houston can light it up and we will mix it up on them if they get going. It is a matter of showing up and playing. Everybody talks about doubling those guys, but all I visualize when we start talking about doubling them is Larry Johnson wide open under the basket.''</p>
        <p>The Pacers kept finding themselves in one-on-one situations with Sprewell and Houston, and too often for the Pacers they lost the matchups. Both players are exceptional at forcing switches and sizing up defenders before slashing toward the basket or taking a quick shot. Indiana appears to have decided, especially late in Game 4, to double both players to take the ball out of their hands in the final critical moments.</p>
        <p>''We usually play better every other day,'' Bird said. ''I expect our team and especially our bench to come back and play well.''</p>
        <p>With vigor. With the sole purpose of extinguishing the Knicks' new life.</p>
