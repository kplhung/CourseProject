        <p>Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen today invited Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and his national security advisers to the Pentagon for a briefing on the state of the nation's strategic nuclear arsenal after criticizing Mr. Bush's recent pledge to reduce the number of American nuclear warheads.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's campaign aides responded by pointing to the military credentials of his advisers and suggesting that the campaign of Vice President Al Gore was playing politics with the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen extended the invitation after Mr. Bush proposed last week to consider making unilateral reductions in nuclear weapons, possibly deeper than those now being negotiated between the United States and Russia. Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, also pledged to construct a far larger antiballistic missile defense than the one now contemplated by the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen, appearing today on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' said Mr. Bush's proposals contained ''internal inconsistencies.'' Building a larger missile defense than the administration's limited one, Mr. Cohen added, would force the Russians and other nations, like China, to increase their own offensive nuclear arsenals, making negotiated reductions far less likely.</p>
        <p>''Any military commander will tell you, it's far better to have more numbers against a defense than to have a higher defense,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''And so what you do by going up higher on defense, you will force the Russians and others to raise their limits much higher.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen's objections echoed those Mr. Gore made during his commencement address at the United States Military Academy on Saturday, when he said Mr. Bush's proposals were harmful to arms control and threatening to global stability.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen tried to couch his remarks as a nonpartisan effort to inform the emerging political debate over the nation's nuclear arms and military strategy. Mr. Cohen, a former senator from Maine and the only Republican in Mr. Clinton's cabinet, expressed his ''high regard'' for the governor and his advisers, who include a number of members from past Republican administrations.</p>
        <p>He said he would invite Mr. Bush to meet with members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Adm. Richard W. Mies, commander of the American nuclear arsenal, as a matter of fairness in the presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>''I think the Joint Chiefs would be willing certainly to do this, and I think it would be important,'' Mr. Cohen said, ''because if this is going to become an area of debate in the fall elections, then I think both candidates ought to have equal opportunity to have access to the information that the vice president does.''</p>
        <p>''I think that he and then Vice President Gore will be in a better position to debate this in a way that's responsible and, I think, informed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mindy Tucker, the Bush campaign's press secretary, said in response to Mr. Cohen's proposal, referring to two key Bush advisers:</p>
        <p>''Surely Secretary Cohen is not suggesting that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and General Colin Powell, who led our defenses, don't understand them. And we are confident that the Joint Chiefs of Staff would welcome Governor Bush's proposal because it allows military planners to determine the appropriate levels of security based on new guidance and a new security era.''</p>
        <p>''We would hope that Al Gore would call on his administration not to play politics with these briefings or the Joint Chiefs of Staff,'' Ms. Tucker said.</p>
        <p>Pentagon officials said the invitation to Mr. Bush was Mr. Cohen's idea. While it is common for a president-elect to receive high-level national security briefings as part of the transition to the White House, it is unusual to extend such an early invitation to a presidential candidate from the party out of power, especially one who has not yet received his party's formal nomination.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Cohen said he ''was appointed in this position to take the politics out of national security debates.'' The invitation, nonetheless, offered tantalizing political implications.</p>
        <p>In light of Mr. Cohen's criticism, the invitation could be seen as a suggestion that Mr. Bush's ideas are ill-formed. At the same time, having Mr. Bush discuss nuclear strategy with senior commanders could lend weight to the governor's handling of military issues in the campaign.</p>
        <p>Pentagon officials said they had not yet made arrangements for a briefing. One potentially knotty problem could be the degree of secrecy concerning nuclear weapons. Since Mr. Bush does not have a security clearance, his briefing might be limited to unclassified information.</p>
        <p>In his proposal last week, Mr. Bush did not say he would reduce the number of nuclear weapons automatically. Instead, he said he would consider reductions based on recommendations by the Pentagon's military commanders. Last Tuesday, even as Mr. Bush made his proposals, those commanders appeared on Capitol Hill and said they would oppose reducing the number of warheads below the 2,000 to 2,500 being negotiated under the third strategic arms reduction treaty, or Start 3.</p>
        <p>Under Start 2, which Russia's Parliament recently ratified, the American and Russian arsenals are supposed to come down to 3,000 to 3,500, from roughly 6,000 today.</p>
        <p>In his remarks today, Mr. Cohen defended the administration's efforts to negotiate the Start 3 reductions with the Russians, as well as changes to the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 that would allow for a limited missile defense against emerging threats from countries like North Korea.</p>
        <p>''I think we have to do it in the context of how we balance the defense and the offense,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''And we should do so in a very methodical, thoughtful, and intellectually sound way.''</p>
