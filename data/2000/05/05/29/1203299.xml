        <p>Alone in third place another stroke back was Nancy Ramsbottom after a somewhat erratic 70.</p>
        <p>Kim, who began the day with a two-shot lead over King, Ramsbottom and Cindy Flom, self-destructed with a 76, as did Flom.</p>
        <p>NELSON GRABS LEAD: Larry Nelson shot a six-under-par 66 yesterday to take a one-stroke lead over Tom Watson after the second round of the Senior PGA Tour's Boone Valley Classic.</p>
        <p>After two inches of rain hit the water-logged course last night, tour officials said they will make a decision today on whether to cancel the final round. If the round is played, the course will be closed to spectators, sponsors and volunteers.</p>
        <p>Nelson had seven birdies and a bogey for a 12-under 132 total.</p>
