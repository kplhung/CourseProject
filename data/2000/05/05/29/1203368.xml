        <p>OTHER athletes are known today as the Rocket, notably pitcher Roger Clemens, the tennis legend Rod Laver and receiver Raghib Ismael, but they plagiarized the nickname. To anyone who saw Maurice Richard play hockey, he was not only the original Rocket, he also deserved to be remembered as the real Rocket, the only Rocket.</p>
        <p>Just as Babe defined George Herman Ruth, Rocket defined the Montreal Canadiens' folk hero who set all the National Hockey League goal-scoring records that Gordie Howe and Wayne Gretzky eventually shattered.</p>
        <p>Whenever Richard scored in the hockey cathedral that was the Montreal Forum, hats, programs, galoshes and newspapers were tossed onto the ice in celebration as the public-address announcer boomed formally, first in French and then in English, ''Goal by Maur-eees Reee-chard.''</p>
        <p>But his coach and former linemate at left wing, Toe Blake, usually referred to him as ''Rocket.'' So did his teammates.</p>
        <p>''I sat beside Rocket in the dressing room for the seven years I played with him,'' center Jean Beliveau once said. ''He was an inspiration and the idol of my generation. On the team we all knew he was kind of an introvert and not the greatest talker.</p>
        <p>''But in his own way, he was a leader and, as players and as a team, we followed him because we were inspired by his desire to win. When we lost, Rocket did not need to say anything to show how hard he accepted defeat. You could see it in his eyes.''</p>
        <p>Yes, those blazing eyes, which finally closed Saturday when he died at 78 after a two-year struggle with abdominal cancer.</p>
        <p>When he had the puck and swooped toward them, goaltenders compared those eyes to headlights and searchlights. Chuck Rayner, once a Rangers goaltender, said that Rocket's hand-eye coordination as a right wing with a left-handed shot put every puck ''an inch inside'' the goal post. He made the No. 9 on his bleu-blanc-rouge uniform hockey's most fashionable number, worn later by Gordie Howe, Bobby Hull and Andy Bathgate, among others.</p>
        <p>''There are better hockey players,'' Richard once said, ''but they don't work as hard. I like to win.''</p>
        <p>In his 18 seasons, the Canadiens won the Stanley Cup eight times, including a record five in a row when he was their captain. He still holds the career record for most overtime playoff goals (6), including three in 1951, and shares the record for most goals in a playoff game (5).</p>
        <p>Of his 82 goals in 133 playoff games, 18 were game-winners. Gretzky is the record-holder with 24, in 221 games. The Devils' Claude Lemieux is next with 19 in 215 games.</p>
        <p>''Rocket always enjoyed scoring goals,'' Beliveau added. ''I'll always remember that he scored four goals in the scrimmage that morning in the fall of 1960, then announced his retirement. He was 39 and had had a couple of injuries, including a torn Achilles' tendon.''</p>
        <p>Richard once spent a day helping to move furniture into a new home for his wife, Lucille, then scored five goals that night. He set 17 records, such as 544 regular-season goals and 50 goals in the 50-game season of 1944-45 during the final months of World War II, prompting some observers to wonder if he was merely a wartime wonder.</p>
        <p>But when many quality players returned to the N.H.L. from military service, Richard was even more dynamic, more famous. Of all his contemporaries, only the younger Howe would eventually be rated better all-around in that six-team league, long before Gretzky and Mario Lemieux thrived in an N.H.L. diluted by expansion.</p>
        <p>With his slick black hair and sturdy 5-foot-10 1/2-inch frame, Richard was an eight-time first-team All-Star, the sociological pride of the French-speaking province of Quebec.</p>
        <p>Richard was not only the best of the French-Canadian players that stocked the Montreal team in those years long before the integration of the American and European players, he was also the best of all the players from the other Canadian provinces where English is the primary language.</p>
        <p>Often fined for flare-ups, his internal flame sometimes exploded. When cut by Hal Laycoe's stick late in the 1954-55 season at the Boston Garden, he attacked the Bruins defenseman with his stick. When the linesman Cliff Thompson tried to stop the assault, Richard punched him twice in the face.</p>
        <p>Clarence Campbell, then the N.H.L. president, suspended Richard for the three remaining games of the season and the entire playoffs.</p>
        <p>When Campbell, whose office was in Montreal, took his seat at the Forum for the Canadiens' next game, he was pelted with trash and someone threw a tear-gas canister on the ice. The fumes sent a sellout crowd hurrying onto Ste. Catherine Street, where store windows were broken and merchandise looted in what was called ''the Richard Riot.''</p>
        <p>The next day Richard was persuaded to go on the radio to calm the city, but the Montreal fans never forgave Campbell for the suspension that cost him the N.H.L. scoring title (which he never won) as well as the Canadiens' bid that year for the Stanley Cup, which they lost to Detroit in the finals.</p>
        <p>Even so, Campbell appreciated Richard.</p>
        <p>''Never,'' Campbell once said, ''have I met a man with such singleness of purpose and so completely dedicated to his profession.''</p>
        <p>The N.H.L. created a new award a year ago, the Maurice Richard trophy for the regular-season's goal-scoring leader. And as well as his youngest brother by 15 years, Henri, naturally nicknamed the Pocket Rocket, played as a member of a record 11 Stanley Cup champions in Montreal, Maurice remains the original Rocket, the only Rocket.</p>
        <p>''People still tell me,'' Henri has often said in recent years, ''that I'm Maurice's little brother.''</p>
