        <p>Late last week, Devils Coach Larry Robinson praised Scott Stevens by invoking a name: Bob Gainey. Robinson said Stevens, his captain and star defenseman, reminded him of Gainey, a former captain of the Montreal Canadiens. Robinson and Gainey played for Montreal in the mid-1970's through the  1980's, when the franchise won six of its 24 Stanley Cup championships.</p>
        <p>''They don't speak a lot,'' Robinson said of Gainey and Stevens. ''But when they do, there is a lot of meaning there.''</p>

        <p>Late last week, Devils Coach Larry Robinson praised Scott Stevens by invoking a name: Bob Gainey. Robinson said Stevens, his captain and star defenseman, reminded him of Gainey, a former captain of the Montreal Canadiens. Robinson and Gainey played for Montreal in the mid-1970's through the  1980's, when the franchise won six of its 24 Stanley Cup championships.</p>
        <p>''They don't speak a lot,'' Robinson said of Gainey and Stevens. ''But when they do, there is a lot of meaning there.''</p>
        <p>Although Gainey's reputation may not be widely known throughout the entire sports world, his name is generally understood in hockey to stand for leadership by example, for competitive integrity and for quiet dignity. From an ex-Canadien of that era, comparison to Gainey is high praise.</p>
        <p>Robinson and Gainey will compete for the Stanley Cup again this week, wearing business suits instead of sweaty uniforms. But only one will get his name engraved in silver this spring. Robinson coaches a Devils team that qualified for the championship round by beating Philadelphia in seven games in the Eastern Conference finals. Gainey is the general manager of the Dallas Stars, the defending cup champions who qualified again by ousting Colorado in Game 7 of the Western finals on Saturday night.</p>
        <p>''We still talk from time to time,'' Robinson said of Gainey. ''I respect and cherish our friendship.''</p>
        <p>When the series begins at Continental Arena tomorrow night, Gainey's Stars will be favored. Not only are they the defending champions, but they also represent a conference that has won the cup the last four seasons. The last time an Eastern team won it was in 1995. That team was the Devils, and they were the underdogs that spring to Detroit.</p>
        <p>There are not many other direct connections between the Devils and the Stars, but one of them is Kirk Muller.</p>
        <p>Now a veteran role player with Dallas at age 34, Muller began his career in 1984 with the Devils, with whom he became a high-scoring power forward before being traded to Montreal in 1991.</p>
        <p>''They're the team I grew up with,'' he said of the Devils. ''I've got a lot of great memories going back. It will be an interesting feeling going in there to play the finals.''</p>
        <p>Muller also has a connection to Gainey and two Dallas teammates. Like Gainey, he is a former captain of the Canadiens. So are Guy Carbonneau and Mike Keane.</p>
        <p>The three of them work together as a checking line. Between Games 1 and 2, Keane, Muller, Carbonneau and Gainey are expected to travel to Montreal to honor another former Canadiens captain. They will attend a memorial service for Maurice Richard, who died on Saturday of cancer at age 78.</p>
        <p>The mourning for Richard, known as Rocket, and the championship-round presence of Robinson and Gainey provide a Memorial Day reminder of the temporal nature of both legendary players and sports dynasties. For much of the 20th century, spring and the hockey playoffs used to mean an intense focus on Montreal. But the Canadiens have won just two championships in the last two decades, and they have missed the playoffs the last two seasons.</p>
        <p>Like Robinson and Gainey, pieces of the last great Montreal group -- the four consecutive championship teams from 1976 through 1979 -- are scattered about the league and doing well. Ken Dryden, the former goalie, is the president of the Toronto Maple Leafs; Scotty Bowman, the coach, runs a good team in Detroit. Other ex-players like Serge Savard, Rejean Houle, Jacques Lemaire, Mario Tremblay, Doug Jarvis, Doug Risebrough and Guy Lapointe have all tried coaching and managing with varying degrees of success. Houle is general manager of the Canadiens; Jarvis is a Dallas assistant coach.</p>
        <p>So why bring up the Canadiens again in this way when they did not even make the playoffs again? Precisely because they are so far from here. It has been a good tournament this spring, and it might be a great final round. But hockey as a whole, expanding wildly to Sun Belt states and college football cities and Nascar counties, needs and misses the mystique of the Montreal Canadiens in the springtime. The appearance of leaders like Robinson and Gainey are a constant reminder, evoking mixed feelings.</p>
        <p>Dryden, an occasional author who also wrote and narrated a television documentary, wrote of these players, that franchise and this sport in his 1983 book, ''The Game.'' At the time, his description of Gainey was an insightful observation about a contemporary player on a great team. Seventeen years later, his words seem like an amber memory from a franchise that has lost its luster.</p>
        <p>''If there is such a thing as a 'player's player,' it would be Gainey,'' Dryden wrote. ''Someone who has the personal and playing qualities that others wish they had, basic, unalterable qualities -- dependability, discipline, hard work, courage -- the roots of every team.</p>
        <p>''And if you want a team game, where the goal is the team and the goal is to win, you need a player with an emotional and practical stake in a team game, a player to remind you of that game, to bring you back to it whenever you forget it, to be the playing conscience of the team. Like Bob Gainey.''</p>
