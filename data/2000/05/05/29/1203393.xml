        <p>In a runoff vote long on protest but short on suspense, President Alberto K. Fujimori swept to victory today against an opponent who had urged his supporters to abstain because of what he called vote fraud and an array of campaign irregularities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori had hoped for a third landslide victory that would venerate his successes in defeating two terrorist groups and hyperinflation and making peace with Ecuador after decades of border tensions. Instead, the 61-year-old president won a hollow victory leaving the country badly polarized and facing possible economic sanctions just as it tries to emerge from recession.</p>
        <p>The balloting capped a campaign full of dirty tricks, violent demonstrations and condemnations from Mr. Fujimori's opponent, Alejandro Toledo, who dropped out on May 18, although his name remained on the ballot. The United States, France, Britain, Canada, Argentina and Costa Rica echoed his criticisms.</p>
        <p>Even before the voting drew to a close, demonstrations grew more intense, and downtown Lima was filled with the pungent smell of tear gas. Government helicopters buzzed overhead as tens of thousands of demonstrators assembled tonight. That scene was played out in cities across the country.</p>
        <p>Speaking to the enthusiastic, chanting crowd, in which many were carrying lit candles, Mr. Toledo said he planned to lead a nonstop, nationwide movement to nullify the election.</p>
        <p>''Dictatorship degrades people,'' the 54-year-old American-trained business professor said. ''It silences people. Dictatorship is the impotence of reason that brings repression.''</p>
        <p>''We need to mobilize people across Peru peacefully,'' said Mr. Toledo, standing in blue jeans and a button-down shirt on a platform overlooking one of Lima's main plazas.</p>
        <p>In a particularly provocative gesture, Mr. Toledo introduced a retired general, Francisco Morales Bermudez, who was the last military president of Peru, to speak to the crowd. ''I've read many chapters of the history of Peru,'' said the general, who ruled Peru in the late 1970's, ''but I have never seen such a shameful thing as this election in the history of our country.''</p>
        <p>Based on exit polls and most of the votes counted, Mr. Fujimori had more than 50 percent, while Mr. Toledo had about 16 percent. The rest of the ballots were left blank or nullified.</p>
        <p>The Organization of American States released a report last week saying, ''The Peruvian electoral process is far from one that could be considered free and fair.'' It said government funds were used in the Fujimori campaign, media access was dominated by the president, and there was not enough time to inspect new computer vote tabulation software to ensure a fair count.</p>
        <p>Before a single vote was cast, election observers from the Organization of American States and the Atlanta-based Carter Center withdrew in disgust after they failed to persuade the government to postpone the election. Mr. Toledo, the only challenger on the ballot, did not vote and told reporters the election was as ''fraudulent as a soccer game in which the field is tilted and one side chooses the referees and the reporters who cover the contest.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori's bid for a third term has stirred opposition here ever since Congress fired three judges more than two years ago for ruling that a constitutional ban on a third presidential term prohibited the president from running. Mr. Fujimori argued that he could run since the Constitution was written after his first term, meaning the ban would apply only if he ran for a fourth term.</p>
        <p>Many voters appeared to be going through the motions of voting in an election that lacked drama after Mr. Toledo pulled out 10 days ago.</p>
        <p>''There is no institution in this country that is free anymore,'' Enrique Fernandez, a 48-year-old folk music promoter, said before voting in the working-class neighborhood of Rimac in order to avoid a $35 fine for not voting or problems with the police. ''The Justice Ministry and election authorities are totally controlled, and this is all a fraud.''</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Toledo predicted that protests around the country would continue to gather momentum. There have already been strikes and road blockades in the cities of Iquitos, Cuzco and Chiclayo in recent days, as well as several violent incidents in Lima, including stone and firebomb attacks by university students on the presidential palace.</p>
        <p>The tainted Peruvian election will dominate a meeting of foreign ministers of members of the Organization of American States in Canada this week. The ministers could ultimately decide on sanctions, although in the past severe action has been taken only in cases of coups or other overt interruptions of democratic process.</p>
        <p>It is more likely that sanctions will come from the United States, where Congress has already passed a joint resolution calling for a review of all political, economic and military relations. Still, it remains doubtful that Washington will cut very deeply into assistance that goes into Peru's efforts at combating terrorism and narcotics trafficking.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration pushed hard for Mr. Fujimori to hold a second-round vote during a questionable slow count in the days following the first-round balloting on April 9. But in recent weeks Washington has softened its criticism of Peru and allowed the Organization of American States, a usually cautious organization, to take the lead in pushing for democratic reform here.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, President Clinton had strong words for Peru on Friday, the day after the election authorities had decided to go ahead with the vote. ''Free, fair and open elections are the foundation of a democratic society,'' he said. ''Without them, our relationship with Peru inevitably will be affected.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori is counting on the United States to go easy on him, rather than jeopardize the cooperation of the two countries in economic, anti-terrorism and especially anti-drug programs that have halved this country's coca plant production in the last five years.</p>
        <p>''It would be terrible if our anti-narcotics collaboration was upset, and we will continue to welcome U.S. investment,'' Mr. Fujimori said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori used an assortment of carrots and rather sharp sticks on his way to a third five-year term. In a wave of populism, he raised the minimum wage and handed out land titles to 150,000 peasants during the campaign. But he was also besieged by criticism by international election observers for a range of campaign irregularities. Mothers dependent on government milk and food handouts were pressed to attend Fujimori rallies, for instance, and intelligence agents harassed opposition leaders.</p>
        <p>Many tabloid newspapers that have connections to Mr. Fujimori's intelligence service and all television networks save one cable station either did not cover the Toledo campaign or tilted their coverage toward salacious and unproved allegations of financial fraud, sexual innuendo and claims that he had an illegitimate daughter.</p>
        <p>Just this week, a journalist who said he had videotapes showing Mr. Fujimori's intelligence chief meeting with election officials was assaulted by three unidentified men. From a hospital bed, he said the assailants had cut his wrist to the bone with a saw as they demanded that he disclose his sources inside the intelligence agency.</p>
        <p>Immediately after the April 9 vote, cries of fraud arose when ballots and tally sheets disappeared for several hours. The election authorities announced that Mr. Fujimori had not received the required majority to avert a second round only after three days of heavy international pressure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Toledo ran a strong race in the April first round, promising to give the poor jobs and to disentangle the courts and congress from the tight grip of presidential control.</p>
        <p>But he appeared to fumble badly when he suddenly dropped out of the race, claiming that he was not willing to lead his supporters into a fraudulent vote unless the election date was postponed several weeks to give international observers an opportunity to audit computer software designed to count ballots.</p>
        <p>He slid in a variety of opinion polls, as voters either expressed disappointment in his apparent surrender or dismay that he was willing to incite unrest and damage the image the country.</p>
        <p>A poll conducted by Datum Internacional between May 19 and 22, which only the week before showed a virtual tie between the two candidates, showed that 55 percent of voters disapproved of Mr. Toledo's decision to drop out of the race. The poll also showed Mr. Fujimori leading Mr. Toledo by a 54 to 46 percent, suggesting that Mr. Fujimori could win a clean, free election anyway.</p>
