        <p>Onward and Upward  Regularly to be found at Avery Fisher Hall, Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic are fixtures of Manhattan's Upper West Side. But today they are going higher -- to 112th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, to be exact, where they will give their ninth annual free Memorial Day Concert at 8 p.m. in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. The program features Bruckner's Symphony No. 7, composed in 1883, introduced in 1884 in Leipzig, Germany, and given its Philharmonic premiere in 1886. Information:  (212) 875-5656.</p>

        <p>EVENTS</p>
        <p>Onward and Upward  Regularly to be found at Avery Fisher Hall, Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic are fixtures of Manhattan's Upper West Side. But today they are going higher -- to 112th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, to be exact, where they will give their ninth annual free Memorial Day Concert at 8 p.m. in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. The program features Bruckner's Symphony No. 7, composed in 1883, introduced in 1884 in Leipzig, Germany, and given its Philharmonic premiere in 1886. Information:  (212) 875-5656.</p>
        <p>Site and Sound  Because Memorial Day honors the dead of all wars, both martial music and a cemetery seem appropriate to the occasion. At 2 p.m. today, the 478-acre Green-Wood Cemetery, at Fifth Avenue and 25th Street between Park Slope and Bay Ridge in Brooklyn, will be the site of a free concert by the Goldman Memorial Band. Led by David Eaton, the band, first organized in 1911 by Edwin Franko Goldman as the New York Military Band, will play works like  ''The Star-Spangled Banner,'' ''The Battle Hymn of the Republic,'' the Goldman marches ''Chimes of Liberty'' and ''On the Mall'' and, with the Fanfare Trumpets of the Merchant Marine Academy, the ''1812 Overture.'' Also on the program are works by by Leonard Bernstein and Gottschalk. Information: (212) 807-4915.</p>
        <p>Shakespeare and Company  The seasons and the centuries roll by, and still the glory of ''Hamlet'' endures. So fittingly the 2000 season of the Shakespeare Festival of Canada, founded in 1953, will start today in Stratford, Ontario, with Shakespeare's great tragedy. But the play, with Paul Gross in the title role, is only the opening attraction of the repertory company's 48th season, which runs until Nov. 5. Other openings this week include ''As You Like It'' tomorrow; ''The Three Musketeers,'' adapted by Peter Raby from the Alexandre Dumas novel, on Wednesday; Wendy Kesselman's new adaptation of ''The Diary of Anne Frank,'' on Thursday; ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' on Friday and ''The Important of Being Earnest,'' on Saturday. Information: (519) 271-4040.</p>
        <p>Art Spectacle  Thanks to major renovations that began last fall at the Musee de l'Orangerie in Paris, some of the world's great art has been on the move. Beginning on Thursday, more than 81 masterpieces from the Jean Walter and Paul Guillaume collection, including 14 paintings by Cezanne, 10 by Matisse, 16 by Renoir, 6 by Derain, 7 by Picasso, 6 by Henri Rousseau and 3 by Utrillo, will alight at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts for a stay through Oct. 15. ''From Renoir to Picasso: Masterpieces From the Musee de l'Orangerie'' includes many paintings never previously exhibited in North America. Information: (514) 285-1600.</p>
