        <p>The New York City Ballet honored its founding choreographer on Friday night with a program at the New York State Theater that celebrated George Balanchine's extraordinary creative versatility.</p>
        <p>There were many exhilarating moments. Nevertheless the evening was dominated by ''Robert Schumann's 'Davidsbundlertanze,''' Balanchine's melancholy masterpiece of 1980. The title, which refers to the accompanying piano score and its composer, reveals no hint of the work's emotional content. As a result the changing choreographic moods come as surprises.</p>
        <p>At first the ballet seems to be a suite for some ardent young people dancing in an unaccountably gloomy ballroom designed by Rouben Ter-Arutunian. The dancers on this occasion were Helene Alexopoulos, Maria Kowroski, Kyra Nichols, Wendy Whelan, Charles Askegard, Nikolaj Hubbe, Nilas Martins and Jock Soto, and all but Ms. Nichols and Mr. Hubbe were making debuts in their roles.</p>
        <p>At times the dancers looked blithely innocent, and at other times passionate. But it soon became apparent that Ms. Nichols and Mr. Askegard were an unusual couple, for he appeared to be wandering off into a dream world all his own while Ms. Nichols tried to steady him.</p>
        <p>Over the years some balletgoers have interpreted the character Mr. Askegard portrayed as a symbol of Schumann himself, who had mental illness. But this role could represent any emotionally disturbed or physically ill person who finds himself divorced from reality and unable to cope with life.</p>
        <p>As the entire cast's dancing grew increasingly intense, as if in response to the troubles of Mr. Askegard and the ever solicitous Ms. Nichols, one could understand the reason for the gloomy scenery, and the sense of drama was enhanced by Richard Moredock's introspective performance of Schumann's score.</p>
        <p>Balanchine turned courtly and convivial in ''Le Tombeau de Couperin.'' In this intricately patterned work to Ravel, two groups of dancers move as if they were mirror images of each other, and on Friday they moved with considerable charm.</p>
        <p>Charm was also one of the virtues of ''Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux.'' This virtuosic duet can be danced with extroverted flair. But Margaret Tracey and Robert Tewsley, a guest artist from the Stuttgart Ballet, emphasized the choreography's graciousness, and Mr. Tewsley's control, ease and sense of quiet joy were especially appealing.</p>
        <p>The program, conducted by Maurice Kaplow, also included a repeat performance of ''Symphony in Three Movements,'' an exciting ballet to Stravinsky in which Balanchine appears to be trying to turn dancers into lightning bolts.</p>
