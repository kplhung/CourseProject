        <p>Take that, Roger. Next time keep your comments to yourself.</p>
        <p>Roger Clemens, producing his best performance of the season, yelled at Trot Nixon in the first inning last night and paid for it in the ninth.</p>
        <p>''He fired me up after the first at-bat,'' said Nixon, whose two-out, two-run home run in the ninth inning gave Pedro Martinez and the Boston Red Sox a 2-0 victory over Clemens and the Yankees in one of the most scintillating pitching duels of the offense-laden season.</p>
        <p>In the first inning, Nixon took a pitch that Umpire Ed Rapuano called strike three.</p>
        <p>''I'm not questioning him; I'm not questioning the umpire,'' Nixon said. ''I couldn't have hit it. I just didn't think he needed to yell. If I get a hit, I'm not going to yell at him. I wasn't trying to show him up at all. I've never done that before. I have the greatest amount of respect for Clemens. I have no idea why he did it. I guess I have one year in the big leagues and he has 20. I've always beefed him up as one of the best pitchers I've faced. I've always admired him growing up and in the minor leagues.''</p>
        <p>So what did Clemens yell?</p>
        <p>''He blurted something,'' Nixon said. ''I caught the tail end of it. I'm not going to question what he did. I guess he yelled, 'That's a strike.' I didn't think it was. But the umpire called it a strike.</p>
        <p>''If he doesn't respect me, that's O.K. It's a war out there. I understand the kind of emotions he has from playing in Fenway for the Red Sox. He's an intense player. So am I. I guess he can do that, but that kind of fired me up. I don't know why he did it. It doesn't matter, though.''</p>
        <p>Yell at Nixon? Who yelled at Nixon? Not Clemens, Clemens said.</p>
        <p>''I didn't say anything to Trot,'' the pitcher said. ''I talk to myself on the mound a lot.''</p>
        <p>In the fourth inning, Nixon struck out again, this time swinging at the third strike. Then he went back to the Red Sox dugout and leveled a whole row of paper cups.</p>
        <p>''The first at-bat and the second at-bat were really poor,'' Nixon said. ''That was time to get out of this little funk or whatever I'm in and start being aggressive at the plate. I said enough of this, go out and attack the ball. Don't look at who's on the mound, look at the baseball. He had his stuff tonight. He's a great pitcher. A lot of people probably question what he can do on the mound nowadays. Just watch this game and you'll see what he can do.''</p>
        <p>In the seventh inning, Nixon lashed a fly ball to the gap in left-center field with one out and hustled it into a triple, although he could just as easily have been called out at third.</p>
        <p>''I was just trying to be aggressive on the bases and get something going,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Red Sox had been through this kind of game before with Martinez pitching. They lost to Tampa Bay,  1-0, on May 6 for Martinez's first loss. But Nixon's aggressiveness did not change the zeroes on the scoreboard. Clemens struck out Brian Daubach and Nomar Garciaparra (for the third time), continuing to rack up strikeouts that would total 13 by night's end.</p>
        <p>Nixon nearly didn't bat in the ninth inning. With two out, Jeff Frye hit a hard one-bouncer to Clemens's glove. If it stuck, Clemens was out of the inning. But it bounced out and Frye got a single when third baseman Scott Brosius had no play.</p>
        <p>''As soon as it hit his glove, obviously he didn't know where it went,'' Nixon said. ''I knew Brosius was playing kind of deep so he didn't have a shot at Frye. I had to continue the inning, just get a hit somewhere. I ended up getting a pretty good pitch and I was able to put a good piece of wood on it.''</p>
        <p>Clemens had been successful all night with his split-fingered fastball, so this time Nixon wanted to avoid it. ''I wanted to get to him as early as possible to keep him from throwing his split-finger,'' Nixon said. ''It had been working all night. I'm sure it wasn't a pitch he wanted to throw there, a four-seamer.''</p>
        <p>The fastball that stayed up wound up in the bleachers in right-center field. All that was needed now was for Martinez to retire the Yankees in the ninth. Easier said than done, as it turned out.</p>
        <p>''The reason I probably got into a little trouble at the end was I wanted to make sure I didn't do what Roger did in that situation,'' Martinez said. ''Nixon was taking some good hacks. He made a mistake and it cost him the game. One little mistake.''</p>
        <p>What Martinez did was hit two batters when he was ahead in the count. ''That's not good,'' he said. ''I want to get them out, not hit them, especially leading off the inning. It's very difficult to overcome.''</p>
        <p>Why did he hit Chuck Knoblauch and Jorge Posada? ''I wanted to hit my spot,'' Martinez said. What he didn't want to do was throw the ball over the middle of the plate. As a result, he threw too far inside and helped the Yankees load the bases.</p>
        <p>But then he got Tino Martinez on a grounder to second base for the final out of a game in which no one suggested the balls were juiced.</p>
