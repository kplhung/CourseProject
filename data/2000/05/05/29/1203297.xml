        <p>It has become increasingly difficult to read a newspaper or magazine without encountering the details of extravagant, conspicuous consumption, usually on the part of new millionaires, or billionaires, usually under 30.

        <p>It has become increasingly difficult to read a newspaper or magazine without encountering the details of extravagant, conspicuous consumption, usually on the part of new millionaires, or billionaires, usually under 30. Stories of $1,000 spent on a bottle of wine. Reports of a dish of boiled sole and a roasted new potato that costs $60, not counting, of course, tips and taxes. Apartments in New York City formerly considered marginally uninhabitable snapped up at the price of half a million dollars.</p>
        <p>Our imaginations are drawn to these stories; they have the allure of soft porn, at least for those of us who congratulate ourselves on not jumping for the bait, those of us who believe ourselves capable of the statement, ''It isn't worth it.''</p>
        <p>But what do we mean by ''worth''?</p>
        <p>When we use the word, we are talking about a system of equivalencies -- a transaction between the symbolic and the actual which many people believe is the most real thing there is, but which is, in fact, a sheer act of imagination. Whose idea was it that a hard, inedible and unprotecting substance (stones, shells, metal) could be traded for food, clothing, shelter?</p>
        <p>The use of money is the purest act of faith; no anchorite who has followed a vision into the desert has acted on an idea as far-fetched as our belief that if we put a dollar in a machine we will be drinking a Diet Coke in a minute. Of course, we don't think of this strangeness all the time, but sometimes, when the numbers seem to have reached the fantastical, we question the idea of worth: how much should be handed over for what things?</p>
        <p>These decisions are often based on personal history or biography. My mother's sense of worth, for example, was much different from mine. She had been a young woman during the Depression and was always haunted by the specter of real poverty, even during the prosperous 50's and 60's. She supported us on a secretary's salary, so we were never able to live luxuriously, but she suspected all expenditure, almost for its own sake.</p>
        <p>She saved wrapping paper and tinfoil and Saran wrap. Closets and drawers were full of discolored papers and crinkled squares of foil and ill-smelling plastics. She usually waited for someone to die before replenishing her wardrobe: wearing the clothes of the dead seemed to her a superior choice to a purchase in a store. She deprived herself of the real pleasures of consumption: we never ate in restaurants or stayed in hotels.</p>
        <p>My cousin and I (he was the son of her sister) feel that every time we buy something that gives us pleasure, we are undoing an old curse. We refer to such activities as ''mental health purchases.''</p>
        <p>The flexibility of a sense of worth was brought home to me last week when my oldest friend and I sent our children shopping in Harvard Square. Thirty years ago, we had spent the summer in Cambridge, she studying physics (she later became a doctor), I working as a secretary in an insurance company (I later became a novelist). That summer, we made a weekly decision about whether we would share a frankfurter at a German restaurant, or a piece of apple cake.</p>
        <p>Half a lifetime later, we dropped our teenage daughters off, shoving bills at them through the car window.</p>
        <p>''How much did you give them?'' my friend asked.</p>
        <p>''Fifty dollars,'' I said.</p>
        <p>''Me too,'' she told me.</p>
        <p>Neither of us believed we had been extravagant, but we noted the difference 30 years and increased prosperity had made. Fifty dollars was liberal, it made us happy that we could offer our children an ease we hadn't had ourselves.</p>
        <p>But what if we had given them $500? Is there ever a point at which it is important to say, ''this far and no further''? Isn't there a moment when we question the relationship between what we paid and what we got?</p>
        <p>Was the plate of sole really worth $60? Was the studio apartment really worth $500,000?</p>
        <p>We use the word ''disposable income,'' but shouldn't we consider what's being disposed of?</p>
        <p>Is it only hypocritical or absurd to question what the poor could do with the money?</p>
        <p>The fact that I have to fear that mentioning the poor will induce only yawns or groans, as if I'd questioned the propriety of sleeveless dresses, tells us something about what seems important, even discussable, to us now.</p>
        <p>In these cloud-cuckooland times, there seems to be a gap between price tag and worth. Shouldn't we consider, without fearing that we've turned into Puritans or killjoys, taking a deep breath before speaking sentences whose language is made up of numbers that seem incomprehensibly distant from what once seemed reasonable?</p>
        <p>Is this a real question, or just my version or my mother's shouted admonition: ''Don't rip that wrapping paper off that box so fast! Do you think I'm made of money?''</p>
