        <p>The Orchestra of the S.E.M. Ensemble paid tribute, before a warmly appreciative audience last Monday night, to the American composer Earle Brown.</p>
        <p>Almost half a century has passed since Mr. Brown, then in his mid-20's, secured his place in musical history with a series of works exploring new kinds of notation and new sorts of floating rhythms. One of his scores looked more like a Mondrian than anything published as music before: an assemblage of slim black rectangles on a white ground, it is visually beautiful and, being completely devoid of traditional notation, has encouraged imaginative performances from pianists.</p>
        <p>But this was only one aspect of Mr. Brown. In the 1960's he produced a number of what he calls musical ''mobiles.'' These scores were open to improvisation and to reordering of segments. Again, they were, as printed objects, elegant to look at. Three of them were included in this concert: ''From Here'' for chorus and orchestra, ''Event: Synergy II'' for two ensembles and ''Modules I and III'' for two orchestras, all requiring two conductors.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Brown was a vital communicator about other people's music. In particular, he produced a series of recordings that, before anyone else was interested, gave wide dissemination to the music of such composers as Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen.</p>
        <p>It was appropriate, therefore, that a work of Mr. Boulez's was included on this program: his first ''Improvisation sur Mallarme,'' sung by Elizabeth Farnum, with the S.E.M. director Petr Kotik conducting the piece's shimmering-tolling ensemble of harp and percussion.</p>
        <p>Also appropriate was the presence here of Edgard Varese, the senior composer to whom Mr. Brown is closest not only personally but also musically in his Franco-American allegiances, his feeling for color and his sense of sound as movement. ''Integrales'' was the work chosen, and it was played strongly, under Mr. Kotik, until the musicians ran out of steam a little before the end.</p>
        <p>But the major emphasis was rightly on Mr. Brown's creative contributions. If the openness of his mobiles now seems less impressive than it did in the 1960's (and the need for two conductors less pressing), the rich, curtainlike chords of the ''Modules'' remain impressive, and the idea in ''From Here'' of chorus and orchestra as separate entities is remarkable.</p>
        <p>Best of all, Mr. Brown is still at work. He was Mr. Kotik's confederate in his double-conductor pieces, and alone led his ''Tracking Pierrot,'' a sextet for the ensemble of Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire'' plus percussion, bristling with surprising contrasts. There was also a recent example of his creative activity in ''Special Events'' for cello (Ariane Lallemand) and piano (Joseph Kubera), the two instruments sparking spasmodic messages to each other.</p>
