        <p>Two men facing an avalanche of evidence in a notorious case that could lead to the death penalty were arraigned in a Queens court yesterday on murder and robbery charges in last week's execution-style massacre at a Wendy's restaurant that left five workers slain and two others shot and left for dead.</p>
        <p>As the suspects, John B. Taylor, 36, and Craig Godineaux, 30, stood silently in a packed courtroom in Kew Gardens, a prosecutor described in gripping detail how the victims were bound, gagged and blindfolded with duct tape, their heads covered with plastic bags, and shot one by one as they knelt in a freezer room.</p>
        <p>''They were marched single file into a big freezer box,'' the prosecutor, Gregory L. Lasak, told Judge Michael Aloise of Criminal Court in a voice trembling with emotion. ''They were told to get on their knees, and they were each shot by the defendants once in the head.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lasak, the executive assistant in charge of major cases in the office of the Queens district attorney, said the defendants, who were arrested on Friday less than 48 hours after the killings, had each made a videotaped confession implicating himself and his accomplice.</p>
        <p>The admissions, he said, included a ''calculated plan'' to rob the Wendy's on Main Street in Flushing, where Mr. Taylor had worked last fall, and to kill the workers to eliminate witnesses. And the confessions included numerous details about how the executions were carried out and how $2,400 in cash was stolen.</p>
        <p>Besides the confessions, Mr. Lasak said, three witnesses, including one of the surviving victims, have identified the defendants as the assailants. And the police found in Mr. Taylor's possession the gun used in the crimes and a videotape from Wendy's surveillance camera showing both suspects, he noted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lasak described the victims as seven hard-working people, and added, ''The evidence we have to tie these defendants to the case is overwhelming.''</p>
        <p>The defendants were each charged with 25 counts -- 5 of first-degree murder for intentionally killing multiple victims, 5 of first-degree murder for the intentional killing of people during a robbery, 10 of second-degree murder not necessarily involving intent to kill, 2 counts of attempted murder, robbery in the first degree and weapons possession in the second and third degrees.</p>
        <p>Conviction of first-degree murder carries a possible death sentence or life in prison. Under the law, the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, has 120 days to decide whether to seek the death penalty. He said yesterday that he had not yet decided, and would consider many factors, including the wishes of the victims' families and what he called the ''callousness, ruthlessness, character, criminal record and motivation'' of the defendants.</p>
        <p>''It's a decision that I do not take lightly,'' Mr. Brown said at a news conference, at which he spoke with somber confidence about the strength of the case, calling the evidence ''overwhelming'' and saying he expected a grand jury next month to return indictments on first-degree murder and other charges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor has worked at fast-food restaurants in New York in recent years and, the authorities say, tried to rob five fast food outlets last year and has been a fugitive since November for jumping bail. Mr. Godineaux, who has recently worked as a security guard in a clothing store, has served three prison terms in the past decade for robbery and drug offenses.</p>
        <p>The suspects did not enter pleas during the arraignment; that is customary in hearings when a grand jury has not yet returned an indictment, especially in potential death-penalty cases. Standing with their lawyers -- John Youngblood of the state's Capital Defender Office for Mr. Taylor, and Heidi Segal of the Legal Aid Society's capital defense unit for Mr. Godineaux -- they said nothing during a 20-minute hearing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor, short and heavyset in a black denim suit, stared straight ahead, while Mr. Godineaux, a tall, rangy man in a black T-shirt and blue jeans, gazed at the floor. Neither was handcuffed, but security in the court was tight, with 10 police and court officers, many of them wearing bulletproof vests, standing by. The wood-paneled courtroom was crowded mostly with reporters, although Judge Aloise excluded cameras.</p>
        <p>There was little discussion of bail. ''There is no greater risk of flight than someone who would have this hanging over their heads,'' Mr. Lasak said when the subject came up. Mr. Youngblood and Ms. Segal did not pursue it, reserving their bail requests, and Judge Aloise remanded the suspects for a hearing on June 26.</p>
        <p>Both men, officials said, will be held in maximum-security cells at either Rikers Island, the city's sprawling East River prison complex, or the Brooklyn House of Detention. At Mr. Youngblood's behest, the judge ordered a suicide watch placed on Mr. Taylor, who, in his confession, said that in the hours before his capture he had thought about killing himself.</p>
        <p>While there appeared to be no friends or relatives of Mr. Taylor in the courtroom, there were a handful of supporters of Mr. Godineaux, and as the suspects were being led away after the hearing, a woman wearing a red sweater over her head shouted, ''I love you, Craig,'' and broke out in sobs, crying, ''Oh, God!''</p>
        <p>Someone else shouted, ''Burn in hell!''</p>
        <p>Unable to get into the small courtroom, which can hold only about 75 spectators, more than a dozen friends and relatives of the victims waited outside in a hallway, many of them with eyes red from crying and the toll of grief and anger etched on their faces.</p>
        <p>''They deserve what they got coming,'' said Louis Bossler, a friend of the Wendy's night manager, Jean Dumel Auguste, 27, of Brooklyn, who had fired Mr. Taylor last October and, investigators said, was the only one of the victims that Mr. Taylor acknowledged shooting with a Bryco .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol he bought for $250 earlier this year on a street in Jamaica, Queens.</p>
        <p>Dramatic details from the confessions of the two men were disclosed by the investigators yesterday. Among other things, Mr. Taylor acknowledged that Mr. Auguste, facing the gun, had begged Mr. Taylor not to harm his employees.</p>
        <p>An investigator, paraphrasing Mr. Taylor's confession, said: ''The manager says, 'I'll give you whatever you want. Just don't hurt anyone,' and he says, 'Don't worry, I won't hurt anyone.' ''</p>
        <p>Officials quoted Mr. Godineaux as saying that Mr. Taylor, after killing Mr. Auguste, gave him the gun, and that he then shot five of the victims. Three of them -- Ramon Nazario, 22, of South Jamaica; Jeremy Mele, 18, of Neptune, N.J.; Ali Ibadat, 40, of Ridgewood, Queens; -- were killed, while two others, Patrick Caruso, 22, and Jaquione Johnson, 18, both of Queens, survived.</p>
        <p>Mr. Castro, shot through both cheeks, played dead and recovered sufficiently to identify both suspects in a lineup over the weekend. Mr. Johnson remained in critical condition at New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens yesterday, but relatives said he had opened his eyes and showed other signs of recovery.</p>
        <p>Both suspects denied having killed Anita C. Smith, 22, of South Jamaica. Given the extent of the suspects' admissions, it was unclear why each refused to admit shooting the woman, insisting that the other did so. Referring to Mr. Taylor, an investigator said, ''He has himself looking away as the shots go off.''</p>
        <p>Investigators said that Mr. Taylor's demeanor in a 45-minute videotaped confession -- a condensed version of his more extensive written statement -- was calm and without apparent remorse. ''His affect was somewhat flat,'' a senior law enforcement official said. ''There was no demonstration of remorse. It was basically like he was just talking about an incident.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Godineaux, by contrast, ''did show more emotion'' in his 30-minute videotaped confession, the official said. ''Whether it was real or feigned I couldn't tell you,'' he went on. ''There was some tears on Godineaux's video. He cried around the time he spoke of the killings.''</p>
        <p>Investigators said that the confessions, in the casual descriptions of horrific details, conveyed a sense of callousness.</p>
        <p>''I think the evidence is pretty clear that they went in there with the intent to kill everyone,'' a senior law enforcement official said. ''It was like a moral vacuum, like it was two guys going to the movies deciding what to go to. It doesn't seem like any more thought went into it.''</p>
        <p>As pieced together by investigators, the story of the association between the two men was relatively brief and banal, aside from its horrendous outcome. They met a couple of months ago when Mr. Taylor took a job at SC&amp;R Clothing, a shop at 89-74 165th Street, in Jamaica, where Mr. Godineaux has been working as a security guard.</p>
        <p>Apparently, officials said, they confided criminal pasts to each other and spoke of committing a robbery together. Mr. Godineaux suggested robbing a livery cab, but Mr. Taylor said too many such crimes had raised surveillance and the dangers. He suggested hitting Wendy's, where he knew the layout and even some of the workers.</p>
        <p>They said they met on Merrick Boulevard on Wednesday night and took an E train from Jamaica to 74th Street-Broadway in Jackson Heights, where they transferred to a No. 7 train that took them to Main Street in Flushing. Mr. Godineaux had duct tape, and Mr. Taylor the gun.</p>
        <p>They entered Wendy's separately shortly before the 11 p.m. closing, ordered food and sat at separate tables. Mr. Taylor glared at a patron, who remembered him and later picked him out of a lineup. After closing time, Mr. Taylor asked Ms. Smith for Jean Auguste, and was directed to the basement office. There, he confronted the manager at gunpoint.</p>
        <p>On orders from Mr. Taylor, Mr. Auguste, using the intercom, called his six staff members downstairs. They were followed by Mr. Godineaux, who ripped the intercom out of the wall before going down. All of this was caught on the Wendy's surveillance tape, but what happened downstairs was not.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Thomas held everyone at gunpoint and Mr. Auguste pleaded that no one be harmed, Mr. Godineaux bound, gagged and blindfolded the victims with duct tape. Plastic bags were slipped over their heads, apparently to catch the blood when they were shot. They were marched into a walk-in refrigerator.</p>
        <p>Mr. Auguste, unable to breathe in the bag, began struggling and almost broke his bonds, according to the suspects' written statements, and Mr. Taylor shot him in the back of the head. He then gave the gun to Mr. Godineaux, who said he shot the other men. Someone also shot Ms. Smith.</p>
        <p>Taking cash, much of it in coins, from the office, and the surveillance tape and the store keys, the men locked and left the restaurant, and were seen by at least one witness, officials said. They then walked south on Main Street, caught a Q-58 bus to Queens and Junction Boulevards, took a cab to Sutphin Boulevard and Archer Avenue in Jamaica, and another cab to Archer and 165th Street.</p>
        <p>They then walked to an apartment on 171st Street, where Mr. Taylor was staying, and split the money. The next day, Thursday, Mr. Taylor went to work at the clothing store. It was unclear if Mr. Godineaux did so. On Friday, Mr. Taylor, listening to a television news report, was stunned to hear that the police, acting on a tip, were seeking him in the Wendy's case.</p>
        <p>He took a Long Island Rail Road train to Brentwood, N.Y., and went to the home of a relative, but he was taken into custody there later in the day. Mr. Godineaux was also arrested on Friday while working at the clothing store. Within hours, the suspects had implicated each other.</p>
        <p>A funeral for Mr. Auguste was held on Saturday at Guarino Funeral Home in Canarsie, Brooklyn. His body was to be returned today or tomorrow to his native Haiti for burial. A service for Mr. Nazario is set for 10:30 a.m. tomorrow at St. Michael's Church in Flushing, and a funeral for Mr. Mele is scheduled for 11 a.m. Wednesday at Clayton &amp; Son Funeral Home in Adelphia, N.J. Funeral arrangements for Ms. Smith and Mr. Ibadat were incomplete.</p>
        <p>The families of all the victims were expected to meet over the next few weeks with Mr. Brown, the district attorney, to discuss their views on whether he should seek the death penalty.</p>
