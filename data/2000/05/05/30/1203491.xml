        <p>Within a few weeks this spring, J. C. Penney, Sears and Kmart all announced they were looking for new chief executives. These separate recruiting drives have essentially created a referendum on which of the ailing businesses is the sickest.</p>
        <p>Finding first-rate talent in the retail industry is notoriously difficult, in part because the best and the brightest are not drawn to a business that often makes executive prospects do time as stock boys.</p>
        <p>But this time, each company expects its competitors' searches to increase the difficulty.</p>
        <p>''If you have a shallow pool and three fishermen instead of one, the one who gets up earliest and spots the jumping fish has an advantage,'' said Gerard R. Roche, the chairman of Heidrick &amp; Struggles, which is conducting Sears's search for Arthur Martinez's replacement.</p>
        <p>The three-way race ''gives a sense of urgency,'' says Hal Reiter, chief executive of Herbert Mines Associates, a New York search firm that is widely believed to be conducting the hunt for Floyd Hall's replacement at Kmart (neither Mr. Reiter nor Kmart would confirm this). It forces companies to ''play the game I call 'head cheerleader.' Everyone wants to date the head cheerleader.''</p>
        <p>But on whose arm do the head cheerleaders want to be escorted? In many ways, the companies are in similar positions. All three are retail chains with revenues of about $30 billion to $40 billion a year, which are being squeezed hard between efficient low-price discounters like Wal-Mart on the one hand and more fashion-conscious speciality chains like Limited and Gap on the other.</p>
        <p>Still, there is general agreement among headhunters and retail stock analysts that Kmart presents the least desirable opportunity. The discounter, which was fast losing ground to Wal-Mart, brought in Floyd Hall, a former executive with the Museum Company and Grand Union in June 1995. Mr. Hall has put the company on a steady train of earnings and sales growth by introducing private brands like Sesame Street Kids and by expanding into Super Kmart formats, extra large stores that sell groceries as well as dry goods.</p>
        <p>Still, Kmart trails its rivals in almost insurmountable ways. Its real estate is older, is cash flow is weaker and computer systems are not as evolved and fully integrated into all aspects of the business. Its stock closed at $7.6875 last Friday, compared with a 52-week high of $17.50.</p>
        <p>And then there is the Martha factor. Kmart brings in some $1 billion in annual revenues from the Martha Stewart brand of 200-thread-count bed linens and coordinated pool furniture. The formidable Ms. Stewart has made it clear that Mr. Hall has not been as responsive as she would like and that she would want to work a little more closely with a new executive.</p>
        <p>''While all our suppliers are important,'' said the Kmart spokeswoman, Shawn M. Kahle, ''they do not have a say in the process. It is a decision to be made by our board of directors.''  Nevertheless, any candidate must know that Ms. Stewart and her penetrating critiques will be constant companions for whoever takes the job.</p>
        <p>It adds up to a particularly challenging package. ''There is always some reluctance to take on a business perceived as having problems,'' Mr. Mines said. ''The person will have to be smart as well as courageous.''</p>
        <p>The company that might be most attractive to candidates is J. C. Penney. Penney's stock closed last Friday at $17.875, compared with a 52-week high of $52.94.</p>
        <p>Whereas Sears and Kmart have already tried turnarounds and made the easiest fixes, like closing the most nonproductive stores and adding more high-margin branded merchandise, there are still many basic changes to be made at Penney, changes that could lead to quick payoffs. ''No outsider has yet come into Penney to cull the low-hanging fruit,'' said Kirk Palmer, who runs a recruiting firm that specializes in retail jobs. ''There is much more upside potential. Plenty of room to hit home runs.''</p>
        <p>Sears is in the best shape of the three, as Mr. Martinez has closed over 100 underperforming stores and slashed 50,000 jobs. Its shares closed at $35.375 on Friday, compared with a 52-week high of $51.19.</p>
        <p>But Sears has a rough road ahead, especially as Home Depot has taken direct aim at its lucrative appliance business. And Mr. Martinez's successor will not find a lot of obvious fat left to cut.</p>
        <p>The last time three rivals had such an obvious face-off was last summer, when Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq were looking for chief executives. Christian &amp; Timbers, a search firm based in Cleveland, came up with the flashiest find at least in Carleton S. Fiorina for Hewlett-Packard. Jeffrey E. Christian, who ran the search, offered this advice. ''By definition, great leaders are few and far between. You've got to find the up-and-comer, the person who will be great.''</p>
        <p>But even great leaders have their limits, something that Wall Street is not likely to forget. Richard L. Church, a stock analyst for Salomon Smith Barney who follows all three chains said that a superstar hire could make a difference in the companies' stock valuations but added, ''the long-term issue these companies face are formidable.''</p>
