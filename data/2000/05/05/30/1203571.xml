        <p>After spraining the medial capsule in his right knee during Game 3, Marcus Camby was not as mobile or as explosive as he would have liked in Game 4, but he was effective. In 18 minutes, Camby came up with eight rebounds, three blocked shots and a big assist to Larry Johnson for a key 3-pointer with 6 minutes 22 seconds left in the game.</p>
        <p>''For the most part, I feel fine,'' Camby said. ''I didn't expect to come here and play big minutes. I did what I could do. I just wanted to go out there and contribute. My lateral movement was kind of shaky. It was tough to push off of my right leg. But I was able to move on my feet, stay in front of guys and block a couple of shots.''</p>
