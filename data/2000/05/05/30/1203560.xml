        <p>Marcus Camby, you break the news to him. ''Not me,'' Camby said. ''I wouldn't want to be the one to do that.''</p>
        <p>Then you do it, Chris Dudley. You took his place in the starting lineup. It is your duty. ''Sorry, you got the wrong guy.''</p>
        <p>Someone, please, tell Patrick Ewing before he comes back and -- heaven forbid -- plays. Monopolizes the ball. Clogs the lane. Kills the Knicks' hopes of making the finals. Ruins the season.</p>
        <p>After 13 postseasons, 131 playoff games -- more than 2,500 points and 1,300 rebounds each May and June since 1988 -- this is hard to say:</p>
        <p>Take a seat, Big Fella. You heard us. Bum foot or not, you're on the bench for the rest of the Eastern Conference finals against the Indiana Pacers.</p>
        <p>And you can stay there -- until the Knicks need a clutch hoop and touch foul in the final 30 seconds of an elimination game. At which point, we will again serenade you, apologize for ever cursing your name and realize how infantile it was to think the Knicks could do this without you, that somehow they are better off when you're not on the floor.</p>
        <p>What reactionary ever made us think otherwise, Joe Benigno?</p>
        <p>Benigno, the WFAN radio host, is a swell guy, more passionate about games than most people who paint their faces and ruin their marriages. Look, we</p>
        <p>Joe.</p>
        <p>But last night, after the Knicks emasculated the Pacers by 91-89 in Game 4, he was warming up for his graveyard-shift show.</p>
        <p>''For some reason, against this team, they're better off without Ewing,'' Benigno said in the postgame locker room. ''I know it sounds crazy. But they don't need him against this team.''</p>
        <p>It gets better. A longtime fan wanted to know at halftime if Jeff Van Gundy is secretly making Ewing's injury sound worse than it is, the idea being that the Knicks' coach understands that his team matches up better with Indiana without Ewing. That, rather than saving the Big Fella the embarrassment of playing him 20 paltry minutes, he now has the luxury of an excuse.</p>
        <p>Even Rik Smits got on the ''Take Your Sweet Time, Pat'' bandwagon. Asked if the Knicks are more potent against the Pacers without Ewing, Smits replied: ''Sure seems that way, doesn't it? They really stepped up their game, all the guys, individually.''</p>
        <p>Smits failed to mention he has been misused in the last two games. After exploiting the Ewing-less Knicks in the fourth quarter of Game 2 and erupting for 21 points in the first half of Game 3, he has not used his 7-foot-4-inch frame for much more than offensive fouls and dislodging the hotel shower head.</p>
        <p>Hard to fathom from a superior offensive team, but the Pacers are playing into the Knicks' hands, making themselves a smaller, slower jump-shooting team.</p>
        <p>Of course, this, too, is Ewing's fault. The most bandied-about statistic after Game 4 was not the Knicks' 41-32 rebounding edge. It was their  5-1 record against Indiana in complete games in the playoffs without Ewing the past two seasons.</p>
        <p>''You know what makes me laugh about that number now is how the media can manipulate it,'' Van Gundy said. ''He played seven minutes in the last game at Indiana, but we count that as with him. Plus, he's never played a home game in that stretch. That makes it look a little better, too.''</p>
        <p>Van Gundy added: ''We play well when we share the ball and we play inside-out. We have four guys we basically go into the post: Pat, Larry, Latrell and Allan. We play off them. So when he is out, we still have three post-up guys that we can go to.''</p>
        <p>All debate aside, the Knicks swung the ball around the perimeter as if they were in concert last night, finding the open man for either a 3-pointer or a layup as they have never done with such precision all season.</p>
        <p>If Larry Johnson was not waiting on the right baseline to knock down a pendulum-swinging shot, Kurt Thomas was tunneling through the nooks and crannies of the Pacers' front line to score a tough layup.</p>
        <p>At one point, Thomas looked Allan Houston off as he came around a screen, like a quarterback faking a handoff to a running back. He knocked down a 15-footer, with all the confidence of a Larry Bird.</p>
        <p>The Game 3 victory was more about adrenaline than great basketball. The Knicks completed all the requisite tasks and received a huge performance from Latrell Sprewell. Game 4 was about a team playing to its strength without Ewing, pushing the ball upcourt as fast as it could, scoring 12 points on the break, using its speed instead of its guile.</p>
        <p>The Knicks had to. It was the only way. Think about it. The Knicks made 10 of 14 3-pointers and they won by 2.</p>
        <p>''If there is one blessing about Patrick being out, it's that we're fortunate we've been through it before,'' Dudley said. ''We had to learn to play without him a year ago. But everybody knows we need him. That's not even a question.''</p>
        <p>Sprewell, when asked about the Knicks' 5-1 record without Ewing, said: ''I don't think that means anything. It's not fair to say we can win without him in there. He was so effective in Game 1 when he was in there. We need him.''</p>
        <p>Ewing said he might play tomorrow night in Game 5. The Knicks will probably not be as unpredictable, the seat-of-their-pants unit that confounded the Pacers here over the weekend. But they will still be better. At 3 in the morning, it is not even worth staying up to debate.</p>
