        <p>With bipartisan political support and a growing national awareness of public health issues, the Irish government is taking aggressive steps that could result in Ireland being the first European country to seek damages from tobacco companies for the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses.</p>
        <p>In April, Irish lawyers and members of Parliament traveled to New Orleans to seek advice from people involved in the landmark American tobacco settlements, including Hubert H. Humphrey III, the former attorney general of Minnesota, and Ron Motley, a leading plaintiffs' lawyer. A parliamentary health committee will soon begin investigating whether three Irish tobacco companies knew about research by their American parent companies into the dangers of smoking and the addictive nature of nicotine.</p>
        <p>In a report published last November, the cross-party committee recommended that the Irish government, the eight regional health boards, the partially state-owned health insurance company and the country's private hospitals should sue the tobacco companies for damages. The committee is currently hearing legal advice before requesting so-called powers of compellability -- the right to subpoena documents and witnesses. But all the nation's political parties have already approved such a move. Batt O'Keeffe, the chairman of the committee, said he wanted to make sure that tobacco companies would not be able to question the legality of the investigation's findings, based on background issues like the membership of the committee.</p>
        <p>A spokesperson for the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers Advisory Committee said that the industry had seen the committee's report, but would have no comment until a specific government proposal is made by the Department of Health.</p>
        <p>While the government's case might not go to trial for several years, 300 civil suits by individuals claiming personal injury damages have already been filed and will reach the courts within a year, plaintiff's lawyers said.</p>
        <p>Peter McDonnell, a lawyer representing 204 personal injury claims against Irish tobacco companies, said that Ireland's small size and relatively simple legal system offer a tremendous advantage in litigation. Cases begun in Ireland's High Court can be appealed only once, to the Supreme Court here.</p>
        <p>And since tobacco companies here act mainly as distributors, the industry has no local lobbying power to create opposition within the government, he argued. ''It's like pushing an open door,'' Mr. McDonnell said.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. McDonnell's clients, Anne Moloney had a lung removed in 1996, along with part of her heart lining, after being diagnosed with lung cancer, she said. Ms. Moloney, now 47, who said she started smoking at 13, contended that she was unaware of any health risks until 1973. (Warnings on cigarette packages appeared in Ireland in 1978, 10 years after they appeared in the United States.) ''My doctor advised me to stop smoking because I would have a small baby,'' she said. ''It never dawned on me that it would cause cancer.''</p>
        <p>The rate of smoking still runs highest among teenage girls, at 40 percent, according to the nonprofit group Action on Smoking and Health. The smoking population dropped to a historic low of 28 percent six years ago, but has since risen to 32 percent. The government attributes 6,500 deaths per year to smoking-related causes in a country of four million people.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Keeffe estimates that the Irish government spends between $570 million and $1.15 billion a year on health-care for tobacco-related illnesses. Mr. McDonnell argues that the potential damages run much higher: based on the damages awarded to the state of Minnesota, he says that Ireland is eligible for a $23 billion settlement. Only two years ago, Brian Cowen, then Ireland's health minister, said that the cost to the government of treating tobacco-related illnesses was just $115 million Irish pounds.</p>
        <p>Micheal Martin, the current health minister who took office in January, has helped set the aggressive tone with his calls for Ireland to become ''a tobacco-free society.'' Recently, he proposed legislation to raise the legal smoking age from 16 to 18 and to sharply restrict smoking in public. He hopes to push the bill through Parliament on a fast track to approval before this summer. In advance of a deadline called for by the European Union, he has promised to implement a complete ban on tobacco advertising in July.</p>
        <p>Ireland's tobacco industry points out that a ban on print advertising makes little sense, because British newspapers with cigarette ads command significant space on newsstands here. ''It's difficult to see the wisdom in Ireland moving ahead of the U.K.,'' the spokesperson said. ''The industry feels that the current packet of regulation, along with the E.U. directive, is one of the strictest in the world and is very adequate.'' Most smokers, of course, resent restrictions on their habit. But the government's initiatives have not raised much of a protest. ''I think Irish people are becoming more aware of their health, and more assertive of their health rights,'' said Hugh Ward, a lawyer who is representing 50 bartenders in lawsuits against their employers. The bartenders claim that extended exposure to second-hand smoke constitutes dangerous working conditions.</p>
        <p>Ireland's pub culture is where widespread acceptance of smoking is more difficult to shake. For more than half of Ireland's pubgoers, a pint glass in one hand is accompanied by a cigarette in the other. Pubs that have attempted to curtail smoking quickly reversed the policy after losing business, according to Dick Dunne, president of the Vintners' Federation of Ireland, the national pub owners' trade association.</p>
        <p>''A blanket ban on smoking would be detrimental to our business,'' said Mr. Dunne, a third-generation publican. Such a ban would be impossible to enforce at small pubs around the country, he said. Instead, the federation wants the tobacco industry to subsidize modern ventilation systems. ''Just because something was taboo overnight doesn't mean we were irresponsible,'' he said in defense of the pub owners. ''A lot of pubs had machines for years, but they didn't work properly.''</p>
