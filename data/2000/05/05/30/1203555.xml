        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A few weeks ago, while sailing my boat in Buzzard's Bay near Nashawena Island, one of my little Cub Scouts sighted a huge bird. He told us all, with extreme confidence, that it was a yellow-nosed albatross. It was a large bird and we didn't give the little Cub Scout much credit because we didn't think he knew what he was talking about. I was dead wrong. The article ''Is It a plane? No, It's a Bird and a Very Rare Bird Indeed'' (May 23) confirmed the young Cub Scout's rare sighting.</p>
