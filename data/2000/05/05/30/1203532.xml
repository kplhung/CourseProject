        <p>From Coach Larry Robinson down to the fourth-line players, the Devils said today that they match up well with the Dallas Stars and are confident they can defeat the defending champions in the Stanley Cup finals, which begin here Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>''This team grew together so much in the last series,'' Randy McKay said of the Devils. ''It has given us so much confidence that we believe we can accomplish anything.''</p>
        <p>The Devils don't seem upset by observers who believe that Dallas will successfully defend its cup. Perhaps those opinions were based on the fact that Western Conference teams had captured the cup the past four years.</p>
        <p>The Stars have an abundance of experienced players, including three former Montreal captains in Guy Carbonneau, Kirk Muller and Mike Keane. And the Stars have snipers like Brett Hull, Mike Modano and Joe Nieuwendyk.</p>
        <p>''I think these teams are closely matched, and it will probably come down to the special teams,'' Robinson said. ''Both teams are built along the same lines believing that the game should be played a certain way. I think it'll be an exciting series.''</p>
        <p>As he did in the previous rounds against the top lines of Florida, Toronto and Philadelphia, Robinson will most likely use his top line of Patrik Elias, Jason Arnott and Petr Sykora to counter the Stars' scoring line of Modano, Hull and Nieuwendyk.</p>
        <p>''They have a few great players on their team that can rip the puck in,'' Elias said, referring to Modano's line. ''We just got to play smart when we're up against these guys.''</p>
        <p>Robinson also said he would be using the defensive tandem of Scott Stevens and Brian Rafalski against the Modano line. That pairing helped contain Florida's Pavel Bure, Toronto's Mats Sundin and Philadelphia's top line in the first three rounds of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Stevens has been the Devils' most dominant player in the postseason. He has a number of memorable playoff hits, like the one on Slava Kozlov against Detroit in 1995, when the Devils captured the cup. His latest one may have ended the career of Philadelphia's Eric Lindros.</p>
        <p>Along with Stevens, the Devils will counter Dallas's snipers and experience with youth and exuberance. The Devils also have more balanced scoring. While the Stars do not have a player with more than two goals after Modano and Hull (with nine each) and Nieuwendyk (with six), the Devils have six players with three or more goals from players not on the top line, which has produced 17.</p>
        <p>Elias leads the Devils with seven goals in the playoffs, Sykora has six, and Arnott, Claude Lemieux, Scott Gomez and Scott Niedermayer have four. Bobby Holik, Alexander Mogilny and Sergei Nemchinov have three apiece.</p>
        <p>''We have more balance and we have commitment,'' said John Madden, a defensive specialist, who has two goals in the playoffs despite  missing three games in the previous round because of an injury to his right knee. ''All I can say is that we've challenged some people in these playoffs, and we'll continue to do so. I think we've come together as a team. It's a great feeling to look around and see that the next guy is as committed as you are.''</p>
        <p>One of four rookies on the Devils -- Gomez, Rafalski and Colin White are the others -- Madden said he was impressed by the way all the players on the Devils had committed themselves to Robinson's system and philosophy.</p>
        <p>''It is so hard to get that at the pro level,'' Madden said, ''because there are so many egos involved. That's why I believe in this team.''</p>
