        <p>The Senate race in New Jersey, lately overshadowed by the recent political drama in New York, now moves to center stage with two hotly contested primary elections on June 6. Voters must choose Democratic and Republican nominees for a general-election contest that could figure in the battle for control of the Senate.</p>
        <p>The Democratic race offers a choice between Jon Corzine, an earnest, big-spending political novice, and Jim Florio, a battle-scarred but knowledgeable former governor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio's strong record of achievement has vastly improved the lives of New Jersey residents, while his strong personality has also created an army of enemies, even within his own party. Mr. Florio's scrappy nature helped produce such gems as the Pinelands Preservation Act that now protects one million acres in the state. During his terms in Congress and as governor, he fought to create the Superfund, as well as to clean up and preserve the state's beaches. As governor, Mr. Florio stood up to the auto insurance industry, and his success in making New Jersey the first state to outlaw semi automatic assault weapons made him a favorite enemy of the National Rifle Association.</p>
        <p>In anticipation of a court order, Mr. Florio increased education financing by springing a surprise tax increase of $2.8 billion on New Jersey voters. The political blunder, now the stuff of legend in New Jersey, led to his defeat by Christine Todd Whitman in 1993. But it is important to remember that Mr. Florio's failure was one of salesmanship, not in his choice of remedies for schools that needed the money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine is also an advocate of educational improvement and such worthy goals as universal health care. The fact that he is a former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company who retired with a $400 million fortune makes his unabashed, old-fashioned liberalism all the more striking. But an unselfish nature cannot substitute for deep knowledge of public policy. When it comes to such details as explaining the $30 billion price tag of his health insurance proposal, Mr. Corzine is simply not in Mr. Florio's league.</p>
        <p>He is also tone deaf on the issue of money in politics. Mr. Corzine has spent more than $30 million  in a largely self-financed campaign and has used his deep pockets for contributions to local parties as a way to win the support of other Democrats. In an age when candidates should be moving toward financial transparency, he has cited partnership agreements with Goldman Sachs as the reason for refusing to release a detailed account of his sources of wealth. All that might be tolerable if Mr. Corzine had advanced a detailed plan for campaign finance reform, but his grasp of that issue seems hazy and perfunctory.</p>
        <p>For all these reasons, we urge New Jersey Democrats to vote for Mr. Florio as the more seasoned and knowledgeable candidate. We do so with full respect for the nobility of Mr. Corzine's political impulses and with the hope that he will become a more articulate student of public policy.</p>
        <p>On the Republican side, the four contenders include three moderates and one former Libertarian. James Treffinger has gotten excellent reviews as Essex County executive, but the real race is between Representative Bob Franks and State Senator William Gormley.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gormley, a forceful ex-Marine, is widely admired in some circles for the independence he showed in 1990 as the only Senate Republican voting for Mr. Florio's ban on assault weapons. That is a considerable badge of honor. Mr. Franks was in the New Jersey Assembly at the time, but skipped the key votes. As a congressman, however, Mr. Franks has supported gun control measures.</p>
        <p>Neither of these candidates is free of weaknesses. Although they have similar moderate Republican views, Mr. Franks tends to circle issues more tentatively, coming around slowly even to the strongest issue in his portfolio, campaign finance reform. Mr. Gormley, whose fulminations in Trenton are legendary, has less difficulty standing firm. But he has a mixed record on the environment, and his campaign is shadowed by his reliance on campaign contributions from the casino industry and shoreline developers in his Atlantic City area. Mr. Franks, for his part, has voted to support campaign finance reform, although he is not a leader on the issue. Despite a troubling committee vote in 1995 to weaken regulations under the Clean Water Act, Mr. Franks has since won improving marks from New Jersey environmentalists.</p>
        <p>On the basis of his overall record as a dependable member of the G.O.P.'s moderate wing and his better record on campaign finance, we urge New Jersey Republicans to choose Mr. Franks as their Senate nominee.</p>
