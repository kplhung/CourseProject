        <p>Fourteen hours later, it was no longer Roger against Pedro in front of a spellbound crowd on a memorable night at Yankee Stadium. Instead, it was Andy against Omar on a more subdued afternoon. There were different names and a drastically inferior ring to yesterday's two starting pitchers, but Andy Pettitte's performance was as stupendous as that of Roger Clemens and Pedro Martinez on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Pettitte was not as overpowering as Roger and Pedro, and there was almost no need for a K corner because he struck out only three, but he allowed just two hits in calmly guiding the Yankees to a 4-1 victory over the Oakland Athletics. Jason Giambi doubled in the first inning, and Pettitte did not permit another hit until Randy Velarde, who turned the 10th unassisted triple play in major league history yesterday, homered in the ninth.</p>
        <p>While Pettitte opposed Omar Olivares, not Pedro or the Red Sox, he was as dominant in efficient fashion. Pettitte used a sinking fastball, a cut fastball and precise control to induce 17 groundouts and erase any possibility that the Yankees would experience a hangover on the day after Boston stymied them and on the day they received their 1999 World Series rings.</p>
        <p>''We needed that game,'' Tino Martinez said. ''Last night was a draining game for us. It was a tough game to lose. To come back today at 1 p.m., we wanted to find a way to win this game. Andy picked us up big time.''</p>
        <p>Pettitte was like a frustrating pitching machine to a team that leads the American League in runs scored. Put in a dollar, watch Pettitte uncork sinking fastballs and the A's slap grounders. He uncorked 110 pitches in the complete game and estimated that 65 of them were sinkers. There were no reasons for Pettitte, who clutched his three-carat diamond World Series ring after winning his second straight start, to tinker with what has generally worked for him.</p>
        <p>''It was a special day, us getting the rings,'' Pettitte said. ''It reminded us that we are the world champs. I definitely wanted to go out there and pitch like I was a pitcher for the world champs.''</p>
        <p>The game took 2 hours 30 minutes, and the Yankees appreciated how quickly Pettitte worked in pitching the first two-hitter of his career. His speedy pace allowed some of the Yankees to dress, shower and breeze to Madison Square Garden for the Knicks-Pacers game.</p>
        <p>Pettitte also kept the infielders alert, especially the embattled Chuck Knoblauch, who might have had his best defensive game as a Yankee with nine assists from second base and a sweet basket catch of a pop-up along the right-field line.</p>
        <p>Six days ago, Knoblauch made a terrible throw that bounced about 30 feet from first base against the Chicago White Sox. Afterward, he hinted at retirement while discussing the stress from the throwing woes that have hampered him since the 1998 season. But eight of Knoblauch's nine throws to first against the A's were solid, and he ranged behind second to field a carom off Pettitte's glove and complete a snazzy play in the eighth.</p>
        <p>''It's a step in the right direction,'' Knoblauch said.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch's two-out single in the third was the first hit against Olivares, and he scored when Derek Jeter smashed a double into the left-field corner. Bernie Williams tripled to knock in the second run in the sixth, the third run scored that inning on Velarde's error and Williams added a homer in the eighth.</p>
        <p>Velarde followed his error by spearing Shane Spencer's liner with two runners moving for the 10th unassisted regular-season triple play in baseball history.</p>
        <p>Still, this day was mostly about Pettitte. Giambi called it death to hit grounders at the Stadium because the grass is thick, so Pettitte used the perfect way to kill the A's. Pettitte was not Roger or Pedro, there were 41,284 fans at the game instead of the sellout crowd Sunday night, and the opponents were not the hated Red Sox. But Pettitte, in his own way, dominated like the pitchers who were on the same mound several hours before him.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>ROGER CLEMENS finally received a World Series ring, ending a 16-year wait through his career. ''Every time I look at the ring, I'll know how hard it was and how long it took for me to get it,'' Clemens said. But apparently Clemens needs to have a correction made to the ring. DEREK JETER said Clemens's ring has the wrong number on it. Clemens started the 1999 season with No. 12 but switched to 22, the number worn by his 13-year-old son, KOBY. . . . ORLANDO HERNANDEZ (stiff back) felt some improvement, and Manager JOE TORRE is leaning toward starting him against the Atlanta Braves on Friday.</p>
