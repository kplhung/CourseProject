        <p>Behind the privet hedges that shield the many monstrous mansions in this village by the sea, something semi-revolutionary is brewing.</p>
        <p>The rich people who summer in the Village of Southampton are up in arms, in an understated, law-abiding kind of way, about an American principle for which Colonial patriots tossed tea into Boston Harbor: taxation without representation.</p>
        <p>''We don't say we cannot afford to pay the taxes -- we never admit to that -- but we don't like to pay taxes that are onerous and we don't like to be ripped off,'' said Lowell Harwood, a seasonal resident. Though he owns a beach house here that he estimates is worth $6 million, Mr. Harwood, like others with a permanent residence elsewhere, cannot vote in village elections.</p>
        <p>The seasonal residents of Southampton are hardly alone in their hunger for a vote away from home. From Cape Cod to Colorado, second-home owners are clamoring -- usually with the help of their lawyers -- for a limited franchise. They want a voice in how their tax dollars are spent and in how much year-rounders may charge them for services they seldom use.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harwood, 70, who made his fortune in parking and property development in Manhattan and whose glass-and-wood home in the dunes has a swimming pool, tennis court and putting green, doesn't expect sympathy.</p>
        <p>''Nobody is going to feel sorry for us,'' he said, referring to himself and his wealthy neighbors on Southampton's Meadow Lane. ''That is not what we are looking for. We just want justice.''</p>
        <p>This village, which predates the Boston Tea Party by 133 years, has been floating in a deep green sea of property tax money since the 1890's. That's when plutocrats like W. K. Vanderbilt began to erect gargantuan houses that they insisted on calling cottages. Since then, in an inexorable march of the moneyed to the sea, more and more summer people have bought their way into Southampton, as more and more year-round village residents have been bought out.</p>
        <p>Village officials say that about three-quarters of the village's property taxes are paid by summer people, who have no vote in local elections unless they choose to make Southampton their permanent residence. The justice that summer people seek is the right to vote on village matters, like who will be mayor and the setting of special tax assessments for roads and water service, while keeping their permanent residence back home, which usually means Manhattan or the suburbs of New York.</p>
        <p>Like most states, New York allows residents to claim only one legal residence for voting purposes. ''You can't have two addresses for voting,''  said Lee Daghlian, a spokesman for the State Board of Elections. ''That is the election law.''</p>
        <p>Yet even some year-round residents of resort communities are beginning to agree with summer people that the law should bend to the reality of an increasingly affluent nation where sales of vacation homes continue to soar. According to a survey this month by the National Association of Realtors, 377,000 vacation homes were sold in 1999, an increase of 9.3 percent from the last survey in 1997.</p>
        <p>''It really is a taxation-without-representation thing up here,'' said John Quenell, a year-round resident of Lower St. Regis Lake in the Adirondacks and a councilman in the Town of Brighton, N.Y. ''The way things work out in the eastern end of Long Island or up here, it is the people who don't live year-round and don't use the services who end up footing most of the bills. It is not fair.''</p>
        <p>In the Adirondack village of Speculator, year-round residents approved spending $5.3 million last year to build a school for 103 students. In response, part-time residents, who account for about 40 percent of the school district's tax base and could not vote on the proposal, filed a federal lawsuit, which is pending.</p>
        <p>There are about a dozen states, including Connecticut, Colorado, North Dakota and Indiana, that grant nonresidents a vote on some local issues. The right was endorsed three years ago by a federal appeals court in Denver, which ruled that seasonal residents who owned property in the tiny resort of Mountain View could vote on all local matters, in a town where they pay eight times more property taxes than year-round residents.</p>
        <p>''It is clear that the nonresident property owners have a sufficient interest in town affairs to make it rational for the town to include them in the political process,'' the Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled.</p>
        <p>That is exactly what Bill Hattrick, a former mayor of Southampton, believes is both fair and inevitable for summer communities on the South Fork of Long Island.</p>
        <p>''It is a grave injustice in this country to take the money of the summer residents and not give them full membership in the club,'' said Mr. Hattrick, a year-round village resident who is president of the Southampton Association, a group of about 700 mostly part-time residents who own large estates.</p>
        <p>Scholars who study tax policy in the United States dispute just how grave that injustice may be.</p>
        <p>''I have never been too concerned that the very wealthy are underrepresented by our political system,'' said James Hines, a professor of business economics at the University of Michigan Business School and director of the school's Office of Tax Policy Research. ''Even if they have one vote, or in this case, no votes, their interests are still represented by their economic power.''</p>
        <p>There is a limit to how much the locals can charge the rich, Professor Hines said, because the rich can simply move away. But he added that in the Hamptons, where competition is keen among the rich and celebrated to flaunt their money and celebrity, the soak-the-rich limit might well be incalculable.</p>
        <p>''On one hand, it is unfair,'' said Professor Hines, referring to what he said is a well-established pattern of year-round residents' extracting high taxes from seasonal property owners. ''On the other hand, it is hard to cry your eyes out about it, given all the other tragedies in the world.''</p>
        <p>Year-round residents of the Hamptons, who spend their summers stuck in traffic and who have seen countless potato farms gobbled up by supersized mansions, certainly are not shedding tears for the disfranchised pain of summer people.</p>
        <p>''You can't really make an intelligent decision as a voter if you are only out here three months a year,'' said Francesca Haley, a waitress at Silver's Restaurant on Main Street in Southampton, who lives in nearby Bridgehampton. ''I don't feel they have a right to dictate how my life is going to be when they are not here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harwood, the wealthy developer who lives on Meadow Lane in Southampton, says he does not want to dictate anything to the year-round residents. He merely wants to fix a costly problem with his water bill, which he says is a monument to ''taxation without representation and taxation without service.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harwood and about 100 other similarly rich property owners on Meadow Lane pay hefty water taxes to the nearby Hampton Bays Water District, although they do not receive a drop of water from the district.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harwood pays $1,800 a year for this nondelivery of water. He also pays about $700 a year for water that he does receive from the Town of Southampton Water Authority.</p>
        <p>Since a hurricane severed a water line in 1938, no one in Southampton Village has been able to take water from the Hampton Bays Water District. But this has not stopped the annual billing. The 5,900 or so people who do receive water (and who live next door in Hampton Bays, a moderate-income community) like having their water taxes subsidized by rich Southampton people who cannot use what they must pay for.</p>
        <p>''If I can afford a house like mine, these people feel that I can afford to pay their water bill,'' Mr. Harwood said. ''I don't mind giving money away to charity, but I don't like it taken away.''</p>
        <p>A referendum has been proposed that would allow voters in the water district to decide if the 100 Southampton property owners in the district who get no water can stop paying bills, which average $1,500 a year. The rub in any such referendum is that property owners like Mr. Harwood, whose permanent residence is in Short Hills, N.J., would not be eligible to vote.</p>
        <p>''We are going to see if we can get the vote,'' Mr. Harwood said. ''Then we are probably going to have to sue.''</p>
        <p>Politicians in the Hamptons say  they are sympathetic to both the frustrations of summer residents and resentments of year-rounders.</p>
        <p>''Permanent residents feel they can't drive around any more because of traffic, and sometimes they can't even walk around because of the crowds of summer people,'' said Joseph Romanosky Jr., the mayor of Southampton Village, which has a year-round population of 3,900 and a summer population of 25,000.</p>
        <p>''And now you are telling them that the summer people should have the right to vote?'' asked the mayor. ''They don't know these people and they don't trust them.''</p>
        <p>Fred Thiele, the assemblyman whose district includes Southampton, said the Legislature in Albany would sooner or later be forced to address the voting matter seriously. In his district on the South Fork, nonresidents own more than half the residential property.</p>
        <p>''This issue is not going to go away,'' he said.</p>
