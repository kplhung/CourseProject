        <p>When he surfaced 14 months ago as a contender for the United States Senate, Jon S. Corzine seemed to have come out of nowhere in a cloud of dust and dollar bills.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, 53, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, is running solely on his record in business, but voters have been given little information about it. His opponent in the Democratic primary on June 6, former Gov. Jim Florio, asserts that Mr. Corzine left a trail of financial victims around the globe. Mr. Corzine defends himself but has revealed little else about his background. He says he remains bound by an ironclad confidentiality agreement, and has refused to release his tax returns.</p>
        <p>But interviews with Mr. Corzine and his former colleagues suggest that in his quarter of a century at Goldman Sachs he was a bundle of contradictions: a trader with a conscience, a capitalist icon with a socialist streak as wide as Wall Street, the head of one of the financial industry's most secretive and profitable institutions who was so generous that, the story goes, if you so much as bumped into him in the hall he practically begged you to take a $5,000 donation to your favorite charity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine followed one of the most humiliating exits in the history of high finance -- in January 1999 he became only the second chief executive to be ousted in the firm's 130-year history -- with an audacious political conceit: despite giving hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates over the years, he had never run for so much as the City Council in Summit, where he lives, and was unknown to all but a few New Jersey politicians.</p>
        <p>But, like the steely bond trader he had been in the 1970's and 1980's, once he assessed the risks and decided on his course, he threw everything he had into his campaign, including a determination that borders on hardheadedness and a large part of his $400 million fortune.</p>
        <p>This much is certain: Mr. Corzine had been laying the groundwork for a political career throughout his rise to power and ultimate downfall at Goldman Sachs.</p>
        <p>A native of Illinois, Mr. Corzine went to Goldman in 1975 with a master's in business administration from the University of Chicago and a year's experience as a bond trader in Ohio. He joined Goldman's fixed-income department, a backwater that had never made any money, which he calls a lucky opportunity. ''I was there as a young, bright guy, and ended up making it successful,'' Mr. Corzine said, ''and much more important to the firm.''</p>
        <p>Janet Tiebout Hanson, who joined the department in 1977, said Mr. Corzine inspired devotion among his troops by remaining calm during even the most disastrous market meltdowns.</p>
        <p>''He was soft-spoken, but he wasn't wimpy,'' said Ms. Hanson, who spent 10 years working three desks away from Mr. Corzine. She now runs her own asset-management firm. ''I used to stand there and watch Jon do half-billion-dollar transactions in a single trade. This was how he, on a daily basis, earned the respect of traders. He didn't have to yell, scream or throw things, like some other people did.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's unusual ''people skills'' may have had something to do with his ambitions beyond Wall Street. Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary who was co-chairman of Goldman from 1990 until he joined the Clinton administration in 1993, remembers Mr. Corzine's confiding in him in the early 1980's that he wanted to run for Congress someday.</p>
        <p>''I was surprised,'' Mr. Rubin said. ''Obviously, being a congressman is a very important thing, but it's a very different thing.''</p>
        <p>As his department ballooned from 80 to nearly 2,000 people and provided more and more of the firm's profits, Mr. Corzine shot up through the ranks. He was made a partner in just five years and given a seat on the management committee in 1985.</p>
        <p>His performance during a nearly catastrophic episode in 1986 made his reputation and ''singled me out as a likely future chairman,'' Mr. Corzine said. The crisis arose when Japanese holders of one issue of government securities failed to adhere to custom and exchange them for a newer issue, meaning that the price of the older securities did not fall, as it ordinarily would have. Goldman, like other Wall Street firms, had bet that the price would drop, and when it did not, the firm's paper losses quickly soared into the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>''We were getting our tails kicked,'' Mr. Corzine said. ''So I came out of my office as a manager, rolled up my sleeves and went back to trading.''</p>
        <p>Convinced that the situation would resolve itself in time, he persuaded Goldman's leaders to hold fast, even as he traded nearly round the clock to maintain the firm's ability to benefit from an eventual turnabout. After five months, he was proven right.  ''And instead of losing hundreds of millions'' -- as other firms had -- ''we ended up making an equivalent amount,'' Mr. Corzine said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's rise culminated in 1994, when he was named to succeed Stephen Friedman, the firm's senior partner, who resigned suddenly after enduring seven months of heavy losses in bond trading. ''Trading had become such a big part of the business that Goldman had to have someone who understood that business,'' said Lisa Endlich, a former vice president who wrote a best-selling history of the firm, ''Goldman Sachs: The Culture of Success.''</p>
        <p>In 1994, she said in an interview, the losses of tens of millions of dollars caused by Goldman's traders had opened a deep rift between them and its risk-averse investment bankers. Mr. Corzine, she said, was a natural choice to put the pieces back together. ''A more strident individual might not have been able to heal those wounds,'' she said.</p>
        <p>By all accounts, Mr. Corzine was about as touchy-feely as they come on Wall Street. In a forest of pinstripes and power ties, he wore a beard and sweater vests. In a world where rank, wealth and ego are often interchangeable, he was as chummy and sincere with chauffeurs and waiters as he was with his peers. ''He's always somebody who would go out with his employees, sit and talk with them, or drop by for a drink,'' Ms. Endlich said.</p>
        <p>He was also famously generous, writing checks to charities, no questions asked, and stepping in to help those in need. When he learned that a secretary who worked late every night was having trouble paying her mortgage, he took over the loan, then helped pay her son's college tuition.</p>
        <p>He talked a Goldman messenger into going back to school and paid his tuition, too, asking only to see the man's report cards. His financial disclosure form as a Senate candidate lists two personal loans, which Mr. Corzine said he was forgiving. One, for more than $500,000, was to the widow of a good friend. Another, for more than $15,000, is to a schoolteacher who moonlighted as a chauffeur and drove Mr. Corzine home every night.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, who had made Ms. Hanson the firm's first female sales manager, showed his progressive bent as chairman by spurring Goldman to recruit and promote blacks and women. And he expanded a one-day-a-year volunteering program to the firm's offices worldwide.</p>
        <p>But his signal achievement was prodding Goldman Sachs to go public. The move, for which Mr. Corzine campaigned relentlessly, eventually, at his insistence, enriched even secretaries and clerks, but ultimately cost him his job.</p>
        <p>Repeated attempts to make a stock offering over the decades had failed. There was a generation gap, in that junior partners who had smaller stakes in the firm would receive far less than older partners. And many feared that the firm's insular, secretive culture would be lost. But Mr. Corzine believed that after the upheaval of 1994 the firm  needed the stability and flexibility that public ownership would bring.</p>
        <p>His colleagues say Mr. Corzine worked Goldman's headquarters  like a political pro, cajoling and glad-handing for support. But his first attempt at a stock sale was a failure: in 1996, he brought the proposal to a partnership vote, but withdrew it at the last minute when he realized that he had little support. Some colleagues viewed this as a terrible blunder; others say it was a master stroke, recalling that Mr. Corzine was given a standing ovation, and that he won changes in the firm's management structure that would help pave the way for an initial public offering.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine made two more changes that proved costly. In 1998, another year of heavy trading losses, he relinquished sole control over Goldman; Hank Paulson, the firm's vice chairman who had long resisted an I.P.O., was elevated to co-chairman and became a cautious supporter of a stock sale. Another change Mr. Corzine made, this time in the name of efficiency, was to pare down the executive committee to just six members, including himself.</p>
        <p>But the shrunken committee led to his undoing: in January 1999, a few months after one of Mr. Corzine's two closest allies on the committee retired, Mr. Corzine was forced to step down as co-chief executive by Mr. Paulson and two of the other members. He kept the title of co-chairman until the public offering was completed in May 1999, when he resigned, taking with him 4.4 million shares of stock.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine said there were three ''conflict points'' between him and his opponents on the executive committee: the I.P.O. itself, the firm's philanthrophy, and its responsibilities to the financial system. He notes that while he sought to carve out $500 million from the stock sale to endow a charitable foundation, the amount was lowered to $200 million when the firm finally went public in 1999.</p>
        <p>But former colleagues say Mr. Corzine erred by behaving like the head of a public company before Goldman had become one. At times, he could seem a loose cannon, failing to build consensus before pushing ahead. The last straw may have been his role in a $3.6 billion bailout of Long Term Capital Management, the hedge fund based in Greenwich, Conn.</p>
        <p>In a few weeks beginning in August 1998, the fund lost billions. Mr. Corzine and the heads of other firms, as well as the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, feared that a fire sale of the fund's assets could take down several Wall Street houses as well. Taking the lead, Mr. Corzine committed $300 million of Goldman's money. He viewed this as the firm's duty to the financial industry. Others at Goldman, he said, ''wanted to walk away.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's opponent in the Senate primary, Mr. Florio, has sought to lay at Mr. Corzine's feet every controversial deal Goldman was involved in during his years as a manager and chairman of the firm. And Mr. Florio has had plenty to choose from: Goldman paid $253 million in 1995 to settle a lawsuit charging that it conspired with Robert Maxwell, the British publishing magnate, to defraud pensioners, rather than risking a jury verdict; in 1998, Goldman rushed into Russia to raise more than $1 billion for that country's nascent capitalists, pocketed huge fees, then stood by as bondholders were left with nearly worthless paper; and it remains indirectly linked to two companies involved in a pipeline venture in Sudan, a deal that critics say is funneling money to a government at war with its own people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine defends himself in each case, saying that he was an early and outspoken advocate for the Maxwell settlement, and that the firm's more controversial overseas activities nonetheless had the blessing of the United States government.</p>
        <p>But he has done little to make his business background clearer, resisting Mr. Florio's daily demands that he divulge his personal income tax returns. Some answers have seemed politically obtuse: he reacted to accusations about Goldman's connections to gun makers by defending the need for the police and the military for well-made weapons.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Corzine's eyes and in the eyes of his former colleagues, his legacy has far more to do with his efforts to take Goldman public, which may provide lessons about the sort of politician he would become.  As chairman he was an optimist, an idealist and an expansionist, so much so that he provided his detractors in the top ranks with ammunition to use against him. By the time they acted in January 1999, after a reprise of the trading losses of 1994, Mr. Corzine had exhausted whatever political capital he had with his fellow executive committee members.</p>
        <p>''If I wanted to stand there and tear the firm apart, we could've had a plebiscite to decide my fate,'' Mr. Corzine said.</p>
        <p>But he said he closed the books on his career at Goldman knowing he had accomplished his principal goal. And if he had used up all his influence in doing so, so what? ''Political capital, unused,'' he said, ''is irrelevant.</p>
        <p>''It's to accomplish things. It's to get things done.''</p>
