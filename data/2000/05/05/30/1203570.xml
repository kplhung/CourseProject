        <p>In one of the more unusual penalties imposed by the National Basketball Association, Rick Carlisle, an assistant coach with the Indiana Pacers, was fined $10,000 yesterday for tripping the Knicks' Latrell Sprewell during the third quarter of Game 3.</p>
        <p>Sprewell, after converting a short jumper with 4 minutes 54 seconds to play in the quarter, spun to head upcourt, passing along the sideline in front of the Pacers' bench. Carlisle, whose feet were sticking out, although out of bounds, tangled with Sprewell's feet, tripping him up.</p>

        <p>In one of the more unusual penalties imposed by the National Basketball Association, Rick Carlisle, an assistant coach with the Indiana Pacers, was fined $10,000 yesterday for tripping the Knicks' Latrell Sprewell during the third quarter of Game 3.</p>
        <p>Sprewell, after converting a short jumper with 4 minutes 54 seconds to play in the quarter, spun to head upcourt, passing along the sideline in front of the Pacers' bench. Carlisle, whose feet were sticking out, although out of bounds, tangled with Sprewell's feet, tripping him up.</p>
        <p>After the incident, Sprewell spoke to Referee Bob Delaney, who later approached Carlisle.</p>
        <p>''I did not want this to happen,'' Carlisle said after the fine was announced. ''I got tangled up with him. My feet were in the wrong place. I acknowledged that in this situation, players are responsible when they make mistakes; I made a mistake for being in the wrong place and not getting out of the way. Well, I have size 15 feet. I'm sorry it happened. That's all I care to say about it.''</p>
        <p>Carlisle spoke with league representatives and did not dispute the events, although he did not acknowledge that what he did was deliberate. He also spoke to Sprewell after Game 3, which the Knicks won, 98-95, and offered his apologies.</p>
        <p>''I talked to Latrell about it after the game, downstairs in the parking area,'' Carlisle said. ''I just want to say that he was very classy as a person and as a competitor, and very graciously accepted my apology. I think things were O.K. in that respect.''</p>
        <p>Sprewell said: ''The incident was unfortunate, but we've put it behind us. He apologized.''</p>
