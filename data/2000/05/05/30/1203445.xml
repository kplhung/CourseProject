        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>We were disappointed by Henry Wong's May 24 Op-Ed article, ''Help China and Help Chinatown.'' His mother's unionized garment job has supported the family, providing health insurance and other benefits, and Mr. Wong is currently receiving a $250-a-year textbook scholarship from Unite Local 23-25.</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, the reasons Mr. Wong states for supporting free trade have created the hardships faced by his mother -- factory closings, depressed wages and worsening conditions. Increased competition has led to the loss of thousands of manufacturing jobs, causing domestic garment production to drop to just 12.4 percent in 1999. Present trade agreements only exacerbate this situation, as corporations continue to leave New York in search of cheap labor.</p>

        <p>The writer is manager of Local 23-25 of Unite (Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees).</p>
