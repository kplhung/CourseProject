        <p>In the nearly two weeks since a 5-year-old girl with cerebral palsy was found dead in her Bronx apartment, her body no more than a 17-pound skeleton pocked with roach bites, investigators have been sifting through the details of her short, ailing life. Did she die of malnutrition, as a preliminary autopsy suggested? Was it her mother's fault? Should anyone have spotted the dangers that awaited the child, or prevented her decline?</p>
        <p>The answers to those questions are weeks away, and who, if anyone, is culpable for the death of the child, Ahsianea Carzan, is far from certain. The medical examiner's report will take another week, and the city's Administration for Children's Services is conducting its own internal inquiry.</p>
        <p>But interviews and a review of records suggest that over the last few years, Ahsianea and her family came into frequent contact with a web of private social service agencies and government officials charged with helping families in crisis.</p>
        <p>Mired in many difficulties at once -- bouncing from one apartment to another, a bitter custody fight, domestic violence charges against the children's father, Caseim Brown -- the Carzans had paraded through Family Court on several occasions. Child welfare caseworkers visited their home at least twice. A probation officer may have, as well.</p>
        <p>They were seen by doctors -- as recently as November -- as well as by school officials, a psychologist and at least two private social service agencies that work with needy children.</p>
        <p>At almost each point, the family was referred to a sprinkling of services. Whether they were appropriate and whether the mother, Ebony Carzan, availed herself of those services or found them helpful remain unclear.</p>
        <p>She seems to have alternately rejected and sought help, particularly when it came to raising Ahsianea, sometimes following the suggestions of professionals, sometimes missing doctors' appointments. She has refused to speak to a reporter.</p>
        <p>In the end, it seems, none of those who came into contact with the family were able to pinpoint the perils that Ahsianea faced. Nor, apparently, were they able to aid her mother, a 24-year-old unemployed woman and former orphan who had fled an allegedly abusive boyfriend and was raising four children alone on welfare and disability benefits for her severely disabled daughter.</p>
        <p>As for her other children -- 1, 6 and 7 years old, and now in the city's custody -- the attorney appointed by the court to represent them says they, too, suffered.</p>
        <p>''It appears there may have been some form of corporal punishment,'' the lawyer, Aleza Ross, said. She could not say, however, if and how the child welfare agency failed to protect them.</p>
        <p>The Carzans first came to the attention of the city school system in April 1998. A doctor at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, where Ahsianea was seen, recommended that she be evaluated for a preschool special education program, according to a spokeswoman for the Board of Education, Margie Feinberg.</p>
        <p>School officials in Staten Island, where the family lived at the time, sought the mother's consent, as required by state law. But consent never came. Ahsianea was never evaluated.</p>
        <p>A few months later, in October, during a custody battle in Manhattan Family Court, the children came to the attention of the Administration for Children's Services. Mr. Brown accused Ms. Carzan of neglect. Child welfare caseworkers visited her home, and the court ultimately granted custody to the mother and visitation rights to the father. (For her part, Ms. Carzan had already accused Mr. Brown of a string of domestic abuse incidents. His criminal case is pending.)</p>
        <p>They may have been visited by a probation officer, frequently used by the courts to inspect homes in contested custody cases, around that time as well. Probation department officials were unable to confirm whether that happened in this instance.</p>
        <p>The child welfare agency's investigation found no evidence of neglect. Still, a portrait of a family in crisis emerged. A spokeswoman for the agency, Jennifer Falk, said they referred Ms. Carzan to a shelter for domestic violence victims and suggested that she seek counseling at the Puerto Rican Association for Community Affairs, a troubled agency shut down a few months later.</p>
        <p>Ahsianea was also referred for evaluation to the Lucille Murray Child Development Center, a private group in the Bronx that assesses and provides day care services for developmentally disabled children.</p>
        <p>There, on Jan. 13, 1999, Ahsianea was seen by a social worker, an occupational therapist, a psychologist and a speech pathologist. Her needs, recalled the social worker, Yolande Schelling, were plainly daunting. The child could not speak or move her limbs. She was blind. She needed intensive treatment -- the sooner the better, by Ms. Schelling's account.</p>
        <p>Ms. Carzan, the social worker noticed, had no help in caring for the child. Indeed, their apartment in the Patterson Houses is not even equipped with a wheelchair ramp.</p>
        <p>''When the child came in for evaluation, I saw possible signs of neglect,'' Ms. Schelling said in an interview last week. ''The child was not receiving any services, and the child was a paraplegic.''</p>
        <p>But to get Ahsianea into a program, her mother needed to submit a doctor's report. Two weeks later, when she failed to do so, officials at Lucille Murray said they became worried. On Feb. 4, they faxed a note to the Administration for Children's Services; officials there responded by saying the family was already known to them.</p>
        <p>Over the next two months, the center twice dispatched a social worker to the family's home, each time pressing Ms. Carzan to furnish a medical report for Ahsianea. ''I was a bit fearful about this case,'' Ms. Schelling said. ''She seemed so overwhelmed, having to bring all these kids. We went to her.''</p>
        <p>The home visits did not put Ms. Schelling at ease. Ahsianea was sitting in a stroller. Why had her mother not acquired a chair especially designed for paraplegic children, she wondered. The girl's hands were clenched in a fist -- cerebral palsy can severely restrict motion -- and the inside of her palm was covered with festering wounds.</p>
        <p>Ms. Carzan did not seem uncaring, Ms. Schelling recalled, just overwhelmed. ''She said, 'I try to do my best,' '' Ms. Schelling said. ''I thought this was a young parent who needed to get that child to treatment.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Carzan finally furnished the doctor's report in April. Though it was not as thorough as she would have liked, Ms. Schelling said, it allowed Ahsianea to be enrolled in a special education program.</p>
        <p>In the end, Ms. Schelling's efforts bore no fruit. The next month, school officials in the Bronx recommended the Lavelle School for the Blind, a private academy in the Bronx under contract with the state. As a kindergarten student, Ahsianea was to attend classes five hours a day, five days a week, and receive language, occupational and physical therapy.</p>
        <p>But according to the spokeswoman for the city schools, Ms. Feinberg, the girl's mother refused. And that was her prerogative: state law does not require a child to be in school until first grade.</p>
        <p>So even after the mother refused, the school system had no reason to call the state central register on child abuse and neglect, Ms. Feinberg said. ''At no time was there any neglect seen,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Officials at the Lavelle School never saw Ahsianea. The next time they heard of their would-be pupil, she was dead.</p>
        <p>For its, part, the Administration for Children's Services closed the Carzans case last August, having found no evidence of neglect.</p>
        <p>A few months later, in October, Mr. Brown was back in court, again seeking custody and again charging that the children were neglected.</p>
        <p>By then, the children's grandmother, Alberta Hanley, had also complained to the agency about possible neglect and abuse. Another visit by a child welfare investigator followed. The older children were interviewed, the home inspected. It does not appear that the caseworker saw Ahsianea. No evidence of abuse or neglect was turned up.</p>
        <p>The next month, a doctor at Lincoln Hospital saw the child. Hospital officials said they could not comment on the doctor's diagnosis, except to say that she had been seen at the hospital twice earlier that year. She had also missed a number of appointments, said a hospital official who spoke only on the condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>The caseworker's report, prepared after the second visit, did not appear to indicate whether the family had received any of the services to which they had been referred the first time around, or whether Ahsianea was receiving treatment.</p>
        <p>Should the caseworker have done more?</p>
        <p>Agency officials said they would not comment until an internal investigation is completed. ''We're looking into whether all proper casework was followed,'' Ms. Falk said.</p>
