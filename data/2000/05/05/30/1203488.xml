        <p>Despite the Clinton administration's hope for a quick resolution to a multibillion-dollar dispute with the European Union over corporate tax policy, the problem appeared to be escalating today on the eve of President Clinton's meeting with European leaders in Lisbon.</p>
        <p>In a statement issued here before Mr. Clinton's departure, Stuart E. Eizenstat, the deputy treasury secretary, said he was saddened and disappointed by a rebuff on Friday by Pascal Lamy, the European Union's trade commissioner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamy said the administration's proposed revision in the way some foreign sales by United States-based corporations were taxed would still not bring the United States into compliance with the World Trade Organization's rules against subsidizing exports.</p>
        <p>''We firmly believe that our proposal is W.T.O. compliant, in fact and in law,'' Mr. Eizenstat said in his statement.</p>
        <p>He added, ''I am saddened that the E.U. has not yet seized this opportunity to negotiate a solution based on our proposal. We are disappointed that a chance may be lost to accomplish this goal.''</p>
        <p>The dispute is over a tax break, worth billions of dollars, that federal law currently allows exporters through the use of so-called foreign sales corporations, subsidiaries set up in places like the Virgin Islands, Barbados and Guam.</p>
        <p>Overseas sales channeled through these subsidiaries escape both sales tax and duties. In 1999, hundreds of United States companies, including Boeing, Microsoft and General Motors, saved about $4 billion by using these legally sanctioned offshore tax havens.</p>
        <p>Despite an agreement between the United States and the European Union not to challenge each other's tax policies, the E.U. challenged the policy on the ground that amounted to an illegal effort to subsidize exports by making them more competitive.</p>
        <p>An appeals panel of the W.T.O. agreed in a ruling three months ago, setting off the administration's effort to come up with an acceptable alternative.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eizenstat said today that even in the absence of a negotiated solution, the administration would work with Congress to enact new tax legislation that in its opinion met the world trade body's objections.</p>
        <p>The tax issue is only one of several trade-related disputes, including skirmishes over bananas, genetically modified products and aircraft noise, that have cast a shadow over economic relations between the United States and members of the European Union.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Eizenstat's plan, the United States would repeal the foreign sales corporation plan and replace it with special income tax rates for both export and nonexport foreign sales by eligible manufacturers.</p>
        <p>The commission said, however, that the changes meant United States-based companies would still have to export to benefit -- the very aspect of the original plan that was condemned by the W.T.O.</p>
        <p>The United States proposal also contained two other elements that the commission considered incompatible with global trade rules -- a 50 percent United States content requirement for products benefiting from tax breaks and a transfer pricing plan that allocates a proportion of profits to the foreign sales corporation.</p>
