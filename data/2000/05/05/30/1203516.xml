        <p>A city councilman from Queens criticized United States Census Bureau officials yesterday for declining an offer from city officials to pay for photo identifications for all census workers in the city.</p>
        <p>The councilman, Walter L. McCaffrey, warned that the lack of photo identification could result in city residents refusing to open their doors to census takers and thieves posing as census workers.</p>
        <p>The councilman's complaints come as thousands of census takers continued to fan out across the city to interview city residents who failed to return detailed questionnaires mailed to their homes in April. Fifty-three percent of city residents returned the mail-in questionnaires, a rate that matched the 1990 figure but included a sharp drop in responses from black households.</p>
        <p>Councilman McCaffrey predicted that the failure to have photo identifications would lead to an undercount that would deny New York the federal funds and seats in legislative bodies it deserved. He predicted that New Yorkers who were reluctant to open their doors to strangers would refuse to speak to census workers.</p>
        <p>''For the city of New York, the census is life or death,'' Mr. McCaffrey said. ''Without an accurate census count, we stand to lose hundreds of millions of dollars.''</p>
        <p>Census officials could not be reached for comment yesterday. But Mr. McCaffrey said bureau officials had told him that providing census workers with photo identification was impractical. Such a move is not being made in other cities, they said, and the turnover rate is so high among the temporary workers that issuing and collecting photo identifications would be nearly impossible.</p>
        <p>At a news conference yesterday on the steps of City Hall, Mr. McCaffrey dismissed those arguments as stalling and ''bureaucratic rigmarole.''</p>
        <p>Hiram Monserrate, a vice president of the Latino Officers Association who appeared with Mr. McCaffrey, said the lack of photo identification created a risk of crime. Officer Monserrate said that he did not know of any cases to date of thieves posing as census workers but warned that the possibility existed.</p>
        <p>He said thieves had been known to pose as workers for Consolidated Edison. ''When we first learned the census would not have photo ID's, we were stunned,'' he said.</p>
