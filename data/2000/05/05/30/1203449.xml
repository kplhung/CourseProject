        <p>Social insurance began in Europe, principally in Germany in the Bismarck era. In 1911, Winston Churchill carried unemployment insurance in the House of Commons, representing the Liberal government. The Tories opposite said the workers would spend the money on drink; Churchill said it was their money. Whereupon a first principle was established.</p>
        <p>The American Association for Labor Legislation, an academic group, was established in 1906. Workers' compensation laws began to appear. Soon, in Albany, Al Smith and Robert F. Wagner brought us ''mothers'  pensions'' and the like.</p>
        <p>In the 1930's, for the first time we enacted national legislation providing unemployment insurance, an old-age pension to be known as Social Security, and a mother's pension, Aid to Families with Dependent Children. The first two programs were presented as contributory insurance. I knew Frances Perkins, who was then the secretary of labor, and have talked with one of the experts involved, Luther H. Gulick of Columbia University. Both would go on about Franklin Roosevelt's insistence that each worker have a separate account, like a bank account. His or hers. As F.D.R. put it to Gulick, so that ''no damn politician can ever scrap my Social Security program.'' (Observe that A.F.D.C. was not contributory. Soon it became known as ''welfare,'' and it was repealed in 1996.)</p>
        <p>President Eisenhower brought us  disability insurance, expanding workers' compensation. Then came President Johnson with Medicare, a contributory health insurance plan, and Medicaid, a welfare measure. A once-a-generation sequence had evolved.</p>
        <p>And now we have the opportunity for a grand culmination, starting this century with a system of voluntary, contributory savings plans such that Americans will end their working lives with a measure of wealth. An estate. And for the first time, an American idea!</p>
        <p>A bit of background. In 1977, Social Security, the retirement program, was changed from a pay-as-you-go system to a partially funded system. The revered Robert J. Meyers, who was present at the creation in 1935 and still analyzes Social Security financing, records, ''The underlying financing mechanism was to build up a reserve.'' No one noticed this. I was a member of the 1977 House-Senate Conference Committee that enacted the law, and I surely didn't notice. Nor was it reported.</p>
        <p>We added two percentage points to the F.I.C.A. tax -- Federal Insurance Contribution Act -- such that today some 80 percent of American households that pay this tax pay more in Social Security than in income taxes. In time, larger Social Security surpluses appeared, enough to moderate the even larger federal budget deficits of the 1980's, and then to bring us into the overall budget surplus of today.</p>
        <p>Now here is the point. If we will make a few, admittedly difficult but wholly defensible changes in the existing program, those two extra percentage points won't be needed. Workers could take back their half -- the employer keeps the other half -- or could choose to invest the two percentage points in a personal savings plan modeled on that available to federal employees since 1987. Let the magic of compound interest work its magic.</p>
        <p>Here are the main changes.</p>
        <p>Use an accurate cost-of-living adjustment. The consumer price index overstates inflation by about eight-tenths of a percentage point, even after recent improvements made by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
        <p>Next, provide normal taxation of benefits, which are now only partially taxed. Then extend coverage to all newly hired state and local workers, a quarter of whom don't pay into Social Security from their primary earnings but get benefits through part-time jobs.</p>
        <p>Finally, increase the number of years counted in computing benefits from 35 to 38. Of a sudden you are in 75-year actuarial balance and don't need those two percentage points of payroll taxes.</p>
        <p>On March 18, 1998, Senator J. Robert Kerrey and I introduced the Social Security Solvency Act, with these benefit adjustments and a provision for a  ''voluntary investment of payroll tax cut by employees.'' In 1999 it became the Social Security Solvency Act of 1999, the first Senate bill introduced in the 106th Congress other than those reserved for the two leaders. We also included Senator Kerrey's proposal to provide every child with a nest egg of $3,500: $1,000 at birth and $500 on each of the child's first five birthdays.</p>
        <p>With respect, this is where the coming presidential debate should begin. The numbers add up; they are from the actuaries at Social Security. There are some tricky details, including a far-off increase in retirement age. (But note that now most folk, 76 percent, retire before reaching 65, the so-called normal retirement age.) And of course the main debate will concern the personal savings accounts.</p>
        <p>It would be unforgivable to label this ''privatization.'' But it has already begun. These savings accounts are being referred to in New York Times reporting as ''partial privatization.''</p>
        <p>The term goes back to the presidential campaign of 1964, in which Barry Goldwater made an offhand remark that Social Security should be made voluntary. In the definitive study, ''Policy Making for Social Security'' (Brookings, 1979), Martha Derthick explained that though the remark was ''not the party's position and not even clearly the candidate's position,'' it was ''transformed by media coverage and the ridicule of rival candidates (including other candidates for the Republican nomination) into a symbol of Goldwater's radical conservatism.'' As such, she wrote, ''it figured conspicuously in the campaign.''</p>
        <p>Doris Kearns Goodwin, a distinguished historian of the period, recently described a Democratic ad of that campaign depicting scissors cutting a Social Security card in half.</p>
        <p>The charge is hurled at every opportunity. Establishing personal savings accounts is described as turning Social Security over to Wall Street. Dock workers would become day traders. A market downturn could wipe out benefits.</p>
        <p>The latter charge is obscene. The present progressive retirement benefit is fixed in our bill. There is no occasion to touch it. We add a savings plan modeled on the Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees, including senators. The government matches up to 5 percent of an employee's pay. The money is invested, at the employee's choice, in one of three plans, ranging from government bonds to a stock index fund. The employee can switch around from time to time. If there is an element of risk even in a 40-year stretch, at no time are basic Social Security benefits at risk. Those are funded and solid, just as they are today and have been for 60 years.</p>
        <p>The Thrift Savings Plan was essentially an adaption for federal workers of various retirement plans, principally the 401(k), as it is known, which were passing the tax committees in the 1970's and 1980's. In the Senate it emerged from the Government Affairs Committee. Al Gore, then a senator and a member of the committee, said on July 30, 1985, ''An employee savings plan with government matching funds will give every worker the opportunity to supplement a defined and predictable pension amount.'' He praised a Congressional Research Service report, ''Civil Service Retirement: Capital Accumulation Plans for Federal Employees.''</p>
        <p>A parallel arrangement under Social Security would, at a 7 percent non-inflation-adjusted rate of return, provide an average worker (making $30,000 a year), with $350,000 of savings at the end of 45 years. A measure of wealth.</p>
        <p>In 1944 the British came up with the slogan of ''cradle to grave'' protection. We propose something beyond: an estate! For doormen, as well as those living in the duplexes above.</p>
