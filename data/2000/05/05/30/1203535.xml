        <p>Hanging on a wall inside Larry Johnson's Westchester County home, there is a photograph of the Knicks' broad-shouldered forward with his three children, all standing in a back corridor of Madison Square Garden. In front of the camera, Johnson is posed with his forearm in the shape of his ''Big L'' while the little ones do their best to copy their dad with what amounts to three lowercase ''L's''.</p>
        <p>''Guess that was taken about a year ago,'' Johnson said last night after the Knicks defeated the Indiana Pacers, 91-89, in Game 4. ''Just after that 4-point play.''</p>
        <p>On that night, Johnson punctured the spirits of the Pacers with a play that became one of the signature moments during an improbable run to the finals for the Knicks. Last night, when the Knicks' 17-point halftime lead had been sliced down to a precarious 1 point, Johnson took his place on the far sideline and waited for a chance to undo Indiana again.</p>
        <p>Marcus Camby grabbed a rebound and whipped the ball to Johnson, who sent a 3-pointer arching off his fingertips and splashing down into the net with 6 minutes 22 seconds remaining in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals. Two minutes later, he escaped the attention of the Pacers one more time and delivered another three to the delight of a Garden crowd in the middle of a flashback.</p>
        <p>It was last year revisited. It was Johnson at his 3-point best, hitting 5 of 5 3-pointers, anchoring an offense without Patrick Ewing and coming up with 25 points to give the Knicks a remarkable victory to even the four-of-seven-game series at two games apiece. Game 5 will be played in Indiana tomorrow night at Conseco Fieldhouse.</p>
        <p>''They was creeping back into it, got it back to 1 point,'' Johnson said. ''That was a big three . That one was a momentum changer.''</p>
        <p>At that moment, every ache and pain the Knicks were feeling went numb for a team that used adrenaline as a wonder drug. Only Ewing, unable to play with the pain from tendinitis in his sprained right foot, was unable to play in Game 4. Latrell Sprewell danced around on a bad foot, Camby leaped on a sore knee and Johnson hung out on the wing unencumbered by a chronically sore back.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't surprised that they gave full effort,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said of his banged up team. ''I don't think there is any question about if they were able to play, how hard they'd play. It was about how effective they could be, how long they could play, and they did a great, great job.''</p>
        <p>They simply ignored the pain. Sprewell had  trouble getting the lift he normally does and was a little slow in tracking Jalen Rose (18 points) in the second half, but he had 12 points and drew double teams each time he slashed inside.</p>
        <p>''I was going to try and suck it up and do what I could,'' Sprewell said. ''I felt like I couldn't explode like I normally do, but I was just trying not to think about it. It's the playoffs, no way I wasn't going to play.''</p>
        <p>There was a temporary burst of excitement during pregame warm-ups when Ewing trotted through the tunnel as the last man out and bounded onto the court. But after a couple of layups, plus a spin move on the sideline, Ewing went back to the locker room.</p>
        <p>''I was in too much pain, I couldn't cut, I would have been a liability,'' Ewing said after the game.</p>
        <p>Asked whether he would play in Game 5, Ewing said: ''It feels a lot better today than it did yesterday and the day before, so I'm hoping that by Wednesday it will be fine and I'm able to play.''</p>
        <p>Even with a small lineup, the Knicks out-rebounded the Pacers, 41-32. And the Knicks found high percentage shots by pushing the ball on the break and finishing with layups. They shot 49 percent while the Pacers hit 45.6 percent.</p>
        <p>Once again, the ubiquitous Charlie Ward (16 points, 7 assists, 6 rebounds) was the choreographer. In transition, he directed guys in place as he fired passes through keyholes to Thomas and Johnson for layups.</p>
        <p>''Charlie is really playing his heart out,'' Johnson said. ''There's always been this back-and-forth with the fans on how they want a different point guard. But they love him now. It's nice to see that, really is.''</p>
        <p>Penetrating, running and slashing through the lane, Ward had the Pacers panting at the action. By halftime, the Knicks held a shocking 57-40 lead after Ward put up 10 points, 5 assists and 5 rebounds. Johnson had 12 points, as did Thomas, who exceeded his playoff career high of 11 points in 19 minutes of playing time.</p>
        <p>But the Pacers came out much more assertive in the third quarter. They got the ball to Rik Smits, Rose came alive and challenged Sprewell's mobility, and Reggie Miller submerged his ego and let his teammates have their chances.</p>
        <p>''We had our usual start,'' Coach Larry Bird said. ''We didn't play any defense in the first quarter. They were hitting shots, just ripping us apart. We gave them too many offensive rebounds and every one of them killed us.</p>
        <p>''We knew this series was going to be tough. They were coming out of Miami after seven grueling games. Maybe they had to catch their breath. We know they are not going to give up.''</p>
        <p>The Pacers showed some resiliency, too. The Knicks were sloppy at the start of the third quarter with two straight turnovers. With a quick 12-5 run, the Pacers cut the Knicks' lead to 10 points. With a 73-65 lead by the Knicks entering the fourth, Miller (24 points) started to shake free of Allan Houston (17 points). Getting open in transition off a turnover by Johnson, Miller punctuated a 6-0 run with a 3-pointer to close the Pacers to within 1, at 77-76.</p>
        <p>''It's like us in Game 1,'' Sprewell said. ''They expended a lot energy to get back into the game and make up that 17-point lead we had. But then I'm not sure how much they had left. Larry stepped up huge for us. He hit those big threes and really gave us some breathing room.''</p>
        <p>And yet, there was drama at the end. After the Pacers pulled to within 3, at 90-87, with 6.4 seconds remaining, Sprewell missed two free throws with 4.1 seconds on the clock. But on the second miss, Rose was called for a lane violation. On the third try, Sprewell connected and gave the Knicks an impenetrable 4-point lead.</p>
        <p>''I had to hit that one,'' Sprewell said. ''I had a second chance. I relaxed, took a breath and hit it.''</p>
        <p>The Pacers didn't have a 4-point play in their bag. They could not unearth the kind of miracle Johnson came up with a year ago.</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>After being found to have an incomplete fracture of the fifth metatarsal in his left foot, LATRELL SPREWELL played last night knowing there was a slight risk that he could complicate the fracture and need surgery.</p>
