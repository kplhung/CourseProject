        <p>The ruling council of the Ulster Unionist Party in Northern Ireland made a momentous and mature decision on Saturday when it voted to resume participation in the government established by the Good Friday peace accords. Britain had suspended the home-rule government in February after only two months because the Irish Republican Army refused to turn over any of its weapons. Earlier this month the I.R.A. offered instead to permit international inspectors to verify that it had put some of its arms caches out of service. The Unionist vote to accept this offer, although by a narrow margin, shows that both Protestant and Catholic leaders can make the compromises necessary for a lasting peace.</p>
        <p>The vote was a tribute to the statesmanship of the Unionists' leader, David Trimble, who has resumed his post as Northern Ireland's first minister.  Mr. Trimble spent the last week in an energetic effort to convince his party not to abandon the peace accords. Gerry Adams, who leads the I.R.A's political wing, Sinn Fein, took the personal and political risks of pressing the I.R.A. to make its arms proposal.</p>

        <p>The ruling council of the Ulster Unionist Party in Northern Ireland made a momentous and mature decision on Saturday when it voted to resume participation in the government established by the Good Friday peace accords. Britain had suspended the home-rule government in February after only two months because the Irish Republican Army refused to turn over any of its weapons. Earlier this month the I.R.A. offered instead to permit international inspectors to verify that it had put some of its arms caches out of service. The Unionist vote to accept this offer, although by a narrow margin, shows that both Protestant and Catholic leaders can make the compromises necessary for a lasting peace.</p>
        <p>The vote was a tribute to the statesmanship of the Unionists' leader, David Trimble, who has resumed his post as Northern Ireland's first minister.  Mr. Trimble spent the last week in an energetic effort to convince his party not to abandon the peace accords. Gerry Adams, who leads the I.R.A's political wing, Sinn Fein, took the personal and political risks of pressing the I.R.A. to make its arms proposal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trimble's last hurdle turned out to have nothing to do with disarmament. Unionists were furious that Britain had proposed changing the name of Northern Ireland's police, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, to the more neutral Northern Ireland Police Service. The change was one of dozens of necessary reforms recommended by a commission headed by Chris Patten, the former governor of Hong Kong, that sought to make Northern Ireland's police more inclusive and accountable. Currently, 93 percent of its members are Protestant.</p>
        <p>Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, cooled Unionist passions by deleting mention of the name change from the police bill now before the British Parliament and announcing that other contentious symbolic issues would be decided later. That debate, however, obscures more serious problems with the police bill. The Patten commission, for instance, wanted Catholics to make up half of each new class of recruits for 10 years. Mr. Mandelson's bill would cut the time period to three years. Mr. Patten wanted a strong ombudsman and civilian oversight board that could demand documents and investigate allegations against police. Mr. Mandelson proposes much weaker versions of both these oversight agencies.</p>
        <p>Parliament needs to make the police bill truer to the Patten recommendations. A durable peace in Northern Island will require not only the kind of political changes that are developing but also a change in powerful institutions like the police.</p>
