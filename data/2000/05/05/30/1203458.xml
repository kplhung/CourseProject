        <p>In an unusually collaborative act of restitution, the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the State Art Collections in Dresden, Germany, announced today that five works of armor that entered the Philadelphia collection in 1977 had been returned to the State Art Collections, which claimed ownership of the pieces five years ago.</p>
        <p>Rather than just having the Philadelphia museum return the rare ceremonial armor, the agreement between the institutions provides for a series of exchange loans, including three major examples of armor from Dresden that have just been put on display in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>The Dresden museums have also agreed to let four colletins, or neck defenses, made for Johann Georg and other Electors of Saxony remain in Philadelphia through 2004 before returning to Dresden.</p>
        <p>The Dresden museums will also lend three other pieces from their collection to Philadelphia through 2004: field armor; gilded tournament armor; and a shield matching an armor in Philadelphia used for jousts celebrating the marriage of Prince Elector Frederic August II of Saxony to Archduchess Marie Josephe of Austria.</p>
        <p>In return the Philadelphia Museum will lend Dresden five paintings from its collection: Courbet's ''Waves,'' Cassatt's ''Woman With a Pearl Necklace in Loge,'' Monet's ''Morning Haze,'' Braque's ''Still Life With Fruit Dish'' and Matisse's ''Still Life on a Table.'' The Matisse will go to Dresden for five years, and the other paintings for six months.</p>
        <p>In 1995 the Dresden museums formally requested the return of five works of armor. After studying their provenance, the Philadelphia concluded that they had been put on the market without the knowledge of the State Art Collections, museum officials said. Originally part of the armory of the Electors of Saxony, the pieces disappeared from a remote storage site to which they had been sent by the Dresden museums for safekeeping during World War II.</p>
        <p>By the early 1950's the objects were on the open market. They were purchased by Carl Otto Kretzschmar von Kienbusch, an internationally known collector who bequeathed his entire collection of arms and armor to the Philadelphia Museum in 1976.</p>
        <p>''We're happy with the loans because we've made a good relationship with a distinguished museum,'' said Anne d'Harnoncourt, director and chief executive of the Philadelphia Museum. She said  that the idea of exchanges had grown out of years of discussions.</p>
        <p>''Museums are born to collaborate with each other,'' she added. ''We all have the same mission:  to connect great works of art with our public.''</p>
