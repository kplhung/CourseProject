        <p>For the first time in more than two years, South Korea posted a current account deficit of $257 million in April, the Bank of Korea said. The central bank attributed the deficit to local banks' repaying large amounts of interest on loans that matured last month. The April deficit compared with a surplus of $181.3 million in March and $1.66 billion a year earlier. The aggregate current account surplus during the four months of the year also declined to $1.03 billion, from $7.82 billion a year earlier.</p>
