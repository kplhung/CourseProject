        <p>There is a story, perhaps apocryphal, that late one evening a few years ago a young father brought his baby son to the Alamo. With spotlights bathing the limestone mission in a yellow glow, the father supposedly lifted the newborn above his head, oblivious to the workings of the modern city, as if making an offering at an ancient altar.</p>
        <p>This, it might be said, was a real Texas baptism.</p>
        <p>Stephen Harrigan, who heard the story while researching his new historical novel, ''The Gates of the Alamo,'' passes it along not necessarily as fact but as a reminder of the enduring claim made by the Alamo on the imagination and identity of Texas. Even today grade school students across the state are taught the Alamo's legend of doomed sacrifice and valor, as a sort of spiritual bedrock upon which Texas was born and built.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harrigan, now 51, was once one of those students. He visited the Alamo as a 7-year-old on a family trip and left transformed. When he decided as a teenager to become a novelist, he concluded that he would write about the Alamo. Three decades intervened before he managed to take up the subject, but much to his surprise he found it largely unplowed, at least in fiction.</p>
        <p>''Everybody thinks it's hackneyed,'' Mr. Harrigan said recently over lunch at the Menger Hotel, a block from the Alamo. ''When I would tell people I was writing a book about the Alamo, they would tend to roll their eyes: Hasn't that story been done to death? But, in fact, as I started doing the research I realized, no, it hasn't. The mythological story is very, very familiar, but the real story is not.''</p>
        <p>Of course, the real story remains a subject of debate. The central tenets, at least as told on the Texas side, is that the vastly outmanned defenders, including William Barret Travis, Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett, refused to surrender although no help was coming, and fought to the death against Santa Anna and his Mexican Army. When Santa Anna was later defeated in the Battle of San Jacinto, thus liberating Texas from Mexico, the victorious Texas army famously shouted, ''Remember the Alamo!'' Recently academics and Alamo enthusiasts convened at the University of Texas in Austin to consider the authenticity of the diary of Jose Enrique de la Pena, a Mexican soldier who took part in the Alamo assault. The diary includes a small passage that describes the capture and subsequent execution of Crockett. That Crockett would have surrendered suggests that perhaps the defenders were not quite so eager to die, and many ''Alamoheads'' claim the diary is a fake. But if academics could not determine its truthfulness, they did confirm its authenticity.</p>
        <p>This tension between mythology and revisionism meant that Mr. Harrigan's novel would require as much historical research as imagination. Determined to provide a ''cold splash of reality,'' he repeatedly interviewed experts: Stephen L. Hardin, the historian, and Thomas Ricks Lindleyan, an independent scholar. He pored over old medical journals, military manuals and records of the Mexican government. From diaries he picked up period expressions like ''Well, if that don't take the dilapidated linen!''</p>
        <p>Ultimately, and not surprisingly, he discovered that many of the old myths he had learned as a child were not true. Perhaps the most famous Alamo story is of Travis gathering his men inside the besieged garrison, informing them that reinforcements were not coming and drawing a line in the sand with his sword and challenging his men to cross it and fight to the death for freedom. It is a stirring anecdote but one considered a fabrication by many modern Alamo scholars.</p>
        <p>''That moment to me is the linchpin of the Alamo myth,'' he said. ''Once that is gone and once that idea of deliberate self-sacrifice is gone, the Alamo story becomes a human story and not a mythological one. You realize these guys were not intent on dying, they were intent on living.''</p>
        <p>One problem in plotting a novel around the real events of the Alamo is that the end is something of downer: everyone dies. To navigate this, Mr. Harrigan framed his book around fictional characters, Texan and Mexican, tossed in a love story and took pains not to tread too fearfully around the historical icons. He paints Bowie as something of a charming swindler and Travis as a foolish but magnetic leader enthralled with his presumed destiny. He admits to being charmed by the homespun Crockett.</p>
        <p>''I was surprised in my revisionist heart how much I like Crockett,'' he said. ''What a good guy he seems to have been.''</p>
        <p>Bruce Winders, the resident historian and curator of the Alamo, credits Mr. Harrigan with creating a vivid story but one based on credible historical assumptions he described as ''extremely current.'' Recent new research suggests that reinforcements were en route to the Alamo, Mr. Winders said, and that Travis, contrary to popular interpretation, knew it.</p>
        <p>''There is much more willingness to accept new interpretations when it's based on solid research,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harrigan, who has written two other novels, a nonfiction book about scuba diving and two collections of essays, has enjoyed the success of his latest book. The novelreached The New York Times hardback fiction bestseller list for one week in April and has enjoyed almost universally glowing reviews. His publisher, Knopf, sent him on a national 11-city tour, which ended this month.</p>
        <p>''I draw the line at wearing a coonskin cap,'' he said with a smile. ''You wouldn't believe how many people have asked me to do that. And on me, a coonskin cap looks like a toupee.''</p>
        <p>Born in Oklahoma City, Mr. Harrigan grew up in Corpus Christi on the Texas coast, attended the University of Texas in Austin and published his first novel, ''Aransas,'' about a dolphin trainer. In the early 1980's he joined the staff of Texas Monthly, the magazine that has nurtured many of the best Texas writers, and for a decade the job allowed him to explore Texas.</p>
        <p>With three daughters and a wife to support, Mr. Harrigan began writing screenplays after leaving Texas Monthly in 1991. Now he is part of a small but successful weekly breakfast club of Austin screenwriters who include Bill Broyles, whose credits include ''Apollo 13,'' and Lawrence Wright, the novelist, screenwriter and writer for The New Yorker. Mr. Harrigan's credits range widely, from the critically acclaimed television drama ''Beyond the Prairie: The True Story of Laura Ingalls Wilder,'' broadcast in January, to far less acclaimed screenplays like the recent ''John Denver Story.''</p>
        <p>He began ''The Gates of the Alamo'' eight years ago, working weekends, nights and mornings around his ''day job'' of writing screenplays. When he finally finished the book, he struggled with a title, dismissing ''Remember the Alamo!,'' out of fear that it would evoke a B-movie cheesiness. One day as he drove down the highway groping with different titles, he looked up and saw a sign that read, ''Alamo Title Co.'' He considered it but thought otherwise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harrigan's ultimate target in writing about the Alamo was Texas itself and ''the death grip'' its history holds on its inhabitants. Even today, the Alamo remains the most visited historical site in the state, with more than three million visitors every year. And Mr. Harrigan believes that even if the real story of the Alamo is something less than the legend, it is no less powerful, or to him, inspiring.</p>
        <p>''The Alamo as an icon speaks to an ideal that I think is very legitimate and very alive and transcends all sorts of cultural and ethnic boundaries,'' he said. ''The ideal is that there is something worth dying for, there is something you would willingly give your life for. Whether that's the liberation of Texas from Mexico, or the stealing of Texas from Mexico, or any other enterprise is kind of irrelevant. What matters is that people have faith in that concept. That's why people remember the Alamo, because that ideal is worth remembering.''</p>
