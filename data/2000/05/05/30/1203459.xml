        <p>If you know something about ''The People's Court,'' Korean animation, N.B.A. players or the movie ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'' you might find something good for a giggle -- or at least a knowing smile -- in the premiere of ''Clerks,'' an animated series based on Kevin Smith's 1994 film.</p>
        <p>You might also shrug your shoulders, wondering how the film's uncompromised slacker characters have gone from fresh and real to cutesy and flat in their journey from a low-budget, black-and-white film to a higher-budget network show.</p>

        <p>If you know something about ''The People's Court,'' Korean animation, N.B.A. players or the movie ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'' you might find something good for a giggle -- or at least a knowing smile -- in the premiere of ''Clerks,'' an animated series based on Kevin Smith's 1994 film.</p>
        <p>You might also shrug your shoulders, wondering how the film's uncompromised slacker characters have gone from fresh and real to cutesy and flat in their journey from a low-budget, black-and-white film to a higher-budget network show.</p>
        <p>Since ABC's ''Clerks'' can't really ape the movie -- which is a different animal, after all -- it sensibly looks to ''The Simpsons'' (with its relaxed zingers that scatter layers of subversive humor) and ''South Park'' (with its strange little universe that skewers ours). ''Clerks'' is after similar territory, but it seems desperate to be clever, with ideas from hither and yon and whatever's nearby bearing down hard on the show's setting: a New Jersey Quick Stop and its neighbor, RTV Video.</p>
        <p>The show's blend of familiar elements is its most successful conceit. The title characters, Dante and Randal, may be convenience store clerks, but they also star in their own pop cartoon and thus mix with the pop culture that swamps their town of Leonardo.</p>
        <p>''Clerks'' can be inventive, and its star voices, Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson (in reprises of their film roles), adjust well to the cartoon universe. But the humor rarely feels organic, and its reach seems far less successful in the remaining episodes that were made available for preview. The jokes at the expense of gays and blacks aren't really offensive; they're just dull. Well, a jokey look at the Challenger explosion isn't dull; you can make your own decision about its merits.</p>
        <p>This series could be more interesting if it trusted its potential. Think of it: two cartoon clerks keep encountering the pop culture that overwhelms their lives, with a biting, class-conscious interchange. Could be good. Could be funny.</p>
        <p>But not if Dante and Randal are going to battle the town's cliched billionaire and a bunch of unhealthy Arab children. In an analysis of funny, such scenes have their own category: not.</p>
        <p>So we have another show for adolescent males. Go for it, guys. This one's all yours.</p>
