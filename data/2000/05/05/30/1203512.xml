        <p>In the hallways, bathrooms and lunchroom of the Bandai Corporation, a major Japanese toy maker, the talk these days revolves around one topic -- an announcement that the company will pay employees one million yen, or $10,000, for every baby they have after their second child.</p>
        <p>Although many other companies give congratulatory bonuses to workers who become parents, Bandai is offering the largest baby bounty in Japan, which is struggling to reverse record-low birthrates that pose many long-term problems.</p>
        <p>Bandai, which makes Power Ranger toys and Tamagotchi electronic pets, said its incentive was intended to help employees defray the high cost of raising children and to expand the company's shrinking customer base -- children.</p>
        <p>''Our employees have been speculating on who will be the first one to take advantage of the offer,'' said the deputy general manager, Yusuke Fukuda. ''We realize that it costs more than one million yen to raise a child from birth to adult. But we are hoping that this large sum will inspire our employees.''</p>
        <p>The offer, which began last month, is part of an effort by the government and employers to persuade the Japanese, who have one of the lowest birthrates in the world, to go forth and multiply. Most initiatives focus on making it easier and more economical to raise children, extending flexible work hours, family leave and child care. Some incentives pay cash and monthly subsidies.</p>
        <p>A law that goes into effect next month will more than double the number of preschool children whose parents qualify for monthly government subsidies. Currently, qualified parents who have children younger than 3 receive allowances of $50 a month for the first and second children and $100 a month for every child thereafter. Under the new law, the subsidies will continue until the children reach 6.</p>
        <p>Welfare officials estimate that 70 percent of preschool children will qualify for the program, which is restricted to households with annual incomes of less than $43,000 for self-employed workers and $67,000 for salaried workers.</p>
        <p>The officials said the $50 subsidy, though seemingly small, covered 25 percent of the basic monthly expense, including food, clothing and utilities for young children. The officials said that by extending the program to 6, they hoped to alleviate some of the financial burdens of child rearing. But they flatly denied that the effort was directly intended to promote childbirth.</p>
        <p>''The Japanese government does not meddle in a woman's decision to have a baby, because that's an individual's personal choice,'' said Tomohiro Onishi, deputy director of the child-rearing promotion division in the Welfare Ministry. ''But our intention is to reduce many of the concerns and hesitations that Japanese people have about having children.''</p>
        <p>The government also plans to expand child care to accommodate the increasing number of working mothers who do not have access to ''affordable'' day care. There are plans to open centers with longer hours.</p>
        <p>It remains unclear whether those efforts will succeed in raising the birthrate. Past efforts have had scant effect, experts said.</p>
        <p>''I have to say that what they have done so far has not been effective,'' said Toshinari Ogino, chief researcher for the Institute of Labor Administration, a research concern. ''Even with these new incentives, most Japanese, especially women, feel that it's just too difficult and expensive to have more than two children.''</p>
        <p>The average birthrate for a Japanese woman was 1.38 children in 1998, a record low for Japan and one of the world's lowest. The government worries that the declining birthrate and rapidly aging population will stem economic growth, because there will be fewer workers to support the growing ranks of the elderly.</p>
        <p>The population is 126 million. But demographers estimate that the number will fall, to 105 million, by 2050, with the median age expected to increase, from 41 to 49. The proportion of the population 65 or older is expected to increase, to 32 percent from 17.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the main factor behind the dropping birthrate is that Japan remains a traditional society where women are still expected to work and take care of the household with little participation by men, Mr. Ogino said. With more Japanese women graduating from universities and obtaining well-paid jobs, many are marrying later and enjoying their independence.</p>
        <p>''Japanese women have more options today than ever before, and they are increasingly saying that they don't want to have a house full of kids that they alone have to raise,'' Mr. Ogino said.</p>
        <p>Yutaka and Yoko Takeda, who have two daughters 11 and 8, said they had long considered having a third child, but that the weak economy and high education costs had discouraged them. Mr. Takeda, 45, said if his company offered a bonus like Bandai, he would strongly consider having another child.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Takeda, 40, said, ''It's just million yen, and that wouldn't substantially change our financial situation.''</p>
        <p>None of the 950 employees at Bandai have qualified for the bonus. The company said it had 140 employees with two or more children. Last year, four employees had their third child, and the company expects that four or five workers a year will receive the bonus.</p>
        <p>''This problem is not something that can be only resolved with money,'' said Mr. Fukuda, the executive. ''As a society, we have provide a more hospitable environment that facilitates child rearing.''</p>
