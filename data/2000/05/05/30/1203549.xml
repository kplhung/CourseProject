        <p>Orni Petruschka, the co-chairman of Chromatis, said he ''could not say anything'' regarding reports that his closely held optic communications company was being acquired by Lucent Technologies for some $5 billion. If concluded, the transaction would represent the largest sale ever of an Israeli-run firm to foreign investors. Though based in Virginia, Chromatis was founded in Israel in 1997 and maintains research operations outside Tel Aviv. The company's flagship product, Metropolis, is a switching system for fiber optics networks.</p>
