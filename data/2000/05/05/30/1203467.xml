        <p>Recently a group of schoolchildren in Harlem heard the soprano Leontyne Price do something she had not done for over two years: sing in public. She had gone to PAL, the Police Athletic League building, a gleaming modern structure for after-school activities at Manhattan Avenue and 119th Street, to read a book she has written to about 30 fourth and fifth graders from P.S. 180. Recently published by Gulliver Books of Harcourt Brace, the book is a children's version of the opera Ms. Price was most identified with during her illustrious career, Verdi's ''Aida.''</p>
        <p>After the reading, which took place in a small classroom, Ms. Price met with some 300 elementary and middle school students from the neighborhood to talk about her life and take questions. The assembly was in a big gymnasium with the students seated on the floor. Ms. Price, 73 and as striking as ever, her black dress adorned with a colorful cape and matching turban, stood on a stage. Looking out at the eager youngsters, she was visibly moved.</p>
        <p>''You have no idea how much it means to me to stare the world's future in the face,'' she told them. ''To see your beautiful eyes, your beautiful skin, your beautiful hearts -- it warms my heart.''</p>
        <p>Touched, she started to sing, without accompaniment, ''This Little Light of Mine,'' her ''mother's favorite spiritual,'' as she used to describe it in recitals. In an interview later that day, she admitted ''never being more nervous'' than when she saw the anticipation on the faces of her young listeners. ''I didn't know whether the word 'opera singer' would intimidate them,'' she said. ''But I didn't want to be condescending either. Kids can always detect that.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, when she began singing, some of the boys and girls initially reacted with grimaces and squelched laughs. To many children everywhere, the sound of an operatic soprano's voice must seem weirdly loud and strange. But most of the youngsters listened agog. Even those pretending to cover their ears seemed stunned. When Ms. Price ended her performance of the tender spiritual with a gleaming high note that sopranos 40 years her junior would covet, the children cheered, applauded and asked for more. She eventually complied, with a grandly moving solo of ''America the Beautiful.'' It has been 15 years since Ms. Price retired from the opera stage by singing ''Aida'' at the Metropolitan Opera, a historic performance broadcast live on television. At the time most critics felt that she was still in impressive vocal condition. ''I was sensitive enough to leave my era and not have it leave me,'' she said during the interview. For the next dozen years Ms. Price sang recitals, though with decreasing frequency. Finally, without drawing attention to herself, she gave her last public recital in Chapel Hill, N.C., two years ago.</p>
        <p>Now she has the time to do things like visit Harlem from her Greenwich Village town house to see schoolchildren and read her ''Aida'' book, colorfully illustrated by Leo and Diane Dillon. She was approached with the idea of writing it by her longtime record company, RCA Red Seal, which has released a compact disc of her reading the story, interspersed with excerpts from her acclaimed 1970 recording of the opera. Record company executives accompanied her on this visit to the PAL building. So the event, of course, had a promotional aspect to it.</p>
        <p>But not to the children, who had been told by their teachers who Leontyne Price is and what she represents to black Americans. However much they knew of her life and work, the young students seemed to respond to her aura, as if some amazing African-American queen mother had come to them.</p>
        <p>At the reading, the fourth and fifth graders listened restlessly at first but soon became absorbed by Ms. Price's calmly compelling account of an Ethiopian princess who is captured and enslaved by her Egyptian enemies yet falls in love with Radames, the Egyptian military hero, who at first does not know her true identity. When Ms. Price finished, the young people sensed that, for all her grandeur, she was no unapproachable diva. They gathered around her to ask for autographs, mug for photographers and exchange hugs and kisses with the special visitor.</p>
        <p>Ms. Price, who will also take her reading to grade schools in Chicago and other cities, has a natural empathy for children from underprivileged backgrounds. She was born in Laurel, Miss., to a father who worked in a sawmill and a mother who was a midwife. They must have been remarkable parents, considering the accomplishments of their two children: Ms. Price and her younger brother, George, who became a brigadier general in the army and who was with her on this day. Since his retirement, General Price, who lives in Washington and is a tall, hardy man with a deep, robust speaking voice, has been his sister's personal manager.</p>
        <p>As a young woman, Ms. Price was encouraged by her church choir director to pursue a career in music. Wanting to be sensible, though, she enrolled at Central State College in Wilberforce, Ohio, and graduated with a degree in music education. But as her teachers made clear, hers was not a ''teaching talent,'' Ms. Price said. So she decided to audition for Juilliard. One of the judges was Florence Page Kimball, who became her devoted teacher. ''She told me that she thought that my voice was a brook that might be Niagara Falls some day,'' Ms. Price recalled.</p>
        <p>But that was her first trip to New York. Was it intimidating? ''Are you serious?'' she said. ''I had heard about the Empire State Building. So the day after the audition I took a double-decker bus and went there, went to the top. It was the most frightening experience of my life. I looked over and said to myself: 'You can't even see the size of the cars down there. You're out of your mind! You're not going to survive a night in this town.' But then I thought, 'I'm going to conquer this place.' Still, I called my mother and daddy and told them, 'Be prepared; I may be overwhelmed by this city.' ''</p>
        <p>In fact, her first great triumphs came in San Francisco and Chicago and Europe. But by 1961, with her Met debut in ''Il Trovatore,'' she finally conquered New York as well.</p>
        <p>At the assembly Ms. Price was introduced by her brother. After greeting the youngsters and singing, she stood onstage and invited them to ask her anything they wanted to. As the students raised their hands and walked one by one up to a microphone in front of the stage, Ms. Price offered motherly encouragements like, ''Come here, angel, talk to me.'' Some of the children instinctively felt that this grand lady was someone they could confide in, for many of their questions were revealing and poignant.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, there were several inquiries about fame. One young man asked, ''How do you become famous?''</p>
        <p>''You earn it,'' Ms. Price said. ''I am still earning it right now with you.''</p>
        <p>''How do you keep your beautiful voice so perfect?'' one small girl asked.</p>
        <p>Ms. Price beamed. ''I love you, dear,'' she said, adding, ''You do it by constant work and constant vocalizing.''</p>
        <p>One student asked, ''How does it feel to be an opera singer?''</p>
        <p>''I feel as close to God as I can be,'' Ms. Price answered.</p>
        <p>When asked why she became an opera singer, Ms. Price said that one day when she was a young girl her mother took her to Jackson, Miss., by bus for a voice recital by ''this beautiful, graceful lady'' who was a ''great concert singer.'' It was Marian Anderson. ''I decided right then I wanted to be her,'' Ms. Price said.</p>
        <p>Several children who had been at the reading asked about ''Aida.'' One wondered simply why Aida was her favorite role. ''When I sang Aida,'' Ms. Price answered, ''I used the most important plus that I have. You have it; I have it: this beautiful skin. When I sang Aida, my skin was my costume.''</p>
        <p>Another youngster had clearly been struck by the sad ending of the story: when Radames is condemned as a traitor and buried alive in a stone tomb, he discovers that Aida, who had escaped, has hidden herself there as well. ''If you could change the story,'' the boy asked, ''what would happen?''</p>
        <p>''That's a very interesting question,'' Ms. Price said. She spoke of how important duty had always been to her, then said: ''I think when Aida was in bondage, she maybe would have fought harder against her strong feelings for Radames and for her feelings for her family and her country, so she might have returned home and fulfilled her responsibilities as a leader of her people.''</p>
        <p>At one point Ms. Price told the children to appreciate that being born an American is ''the most incredible thing to have happened to you,'' a statement that carried special resonance coming from a woman who attended segregated schools in the Deep South.</p>
        <p>Asked what she did as a child in Mississippi, Ms. Price talked about playing hopscotch and dancing around a maypole with streamers made of fabric strips left over from her mother's quilting. Later in high school she loved being a drum majorette. Asked how her parents felt about her wanting to be an opera singer, Ms. Price answered, ''They loved it and they loved me.''</p>
        <p>Then an awkward young girl timidly approached the microphone and asked in a soft voice, ''Was it difficult for you growing up?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Price, quite touched, said, ''Well, sweetheart, let me turn the question around. Is it difficult for you growing up?''</p>
        <p>The girl nodded her head and said, ''Yes.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Price inquired further. Was it problems with friends, school, homework, family, things like that? The girl nodded yes again.</p>
        <p>''Angel,'' Ms. Price said, ''what I can tell you is that it does get better. All the things you think are negative now will change. I promise you; I promise you.''</p>
        <p>The assembly ended when an adorably sassy young girl, signaled by a teacher, headed straight up to the microphone and rather than asking a question, thanked Ms. Price for coming and declared her to be a ''really beautiful 'go girl.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Price roared with laughter and gratitude, started gyrating on stage, dancing and waving her arms -- proving to these Harlem youngsters that she has rhythm as well as soul.</p>
