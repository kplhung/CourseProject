      <block class="full_text">
        <p>THIS sanctioned gab session -- he asked permission from his boss, the shock jock Don Imus -- with one of talk radio's more controversial purveyors is conducted inside a claustrophobic bunker at WFAN's basement studios and kicks off with a binge-and-purge exercise.</p>
        <p>Its instigator is Bernard McGuirk, for 13 years the producer of the wildly, make that wickedly, popular ''Imus in the Morning,'' and its purpose, according to him, is to get the expletives out of the way sooner so he can be more articulate later. You go, guy. After all, you've been up swilling caffeine since 3:45 a.m. and spilling insults on the air since 5.</p>
        <p>So the tape recorder is switched off and Mr. McGuirk, shrieking like an X-rated Richard Simmons in front of a transfixed class of two -- a reporter and photographer -- gets the nasties out of his system with a bang. And has significant fun expelling them before smoothing his dress-down-Friday chinos and settling into a squeaky executive chair from which, between PG-rated answers, he alternately yanks at and shoves away his microphone like a toddler confronting a spoonful of vegetables.</p>
        <p>Believe it or not, Mr. McGuirk, who calls Mr. Imus his lord, master and mentor and happily submits to being labeled ''a bald-headed stooge'' by the boss in return for all that homage, was once an altar boy back in the South Bronx. And wore a jacket and tie to Cardinal Hayes High School. Easier to believe the producer's mother used to routinely scrub out his mouth with soap when she caught him using it to utter forbidden epithets.</p>
        <p>''I thought it happened to everybody,'' he says, noting that it hasn't happened yet to his own children, 7 and 4, but that he'll be armed and ready if insurrection invades their Lido Beach, N.Y., household. ''And I won't be using wimpy soap, either. No Irish Spring,'' sneeringly says Mr. McGuirk, whose strict Irish immigrant parents ''came off the boat with barely two nickels to rub together.''</p>
        <p>Lately other authoritarian types, the CBS correspondent Mike Wallace among them, have suggested that the mouthy Mr. McGuirk, now 39 and coaching Little League in suburbia in his spare time, has again qualified for the soap treatment despite being old enough, as Mr. Imus delights in observing, to be losing his hair at a rapid clip. Only this time Mr. McGuirk's supposed transgression is bigotry, not blasphemy.</p>
        <p>UNSETTLED by the producer's irreverent parodies of black sports stars -- notably the Nets' Jayson Williams -- and his embellishments to Mr. Imus's periodically toxic diatribes, Mr. Wallace charged that Mr. McGuirk ''glories in the role of resident bigot'' on the program, and an on-line opinion journal recently seconded the assault.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGuirk, who describes himself and Mr. Imus as equal opportunity satirists and their subjects as fair game for verbal evisceration, begs to differ. He mutters that a defanged and declawed Imus show would pack all the punch of NPR and alienate its listeners: ''They don't want to hear nice guys; nice guys are a dime a dozen.''</p>
        <p>Not that he thinks of his humor as mean; just cynical, very cynical.</p>
        <p>''I don't glory in anything,'' he says. Like the times he refers to the New York Knicks, his least favorite N.B.A. team, as chest-bumping pimps?</p>
        <p>''It's meant to be descriptive, not pejorative. If the N.B.A. were peopled by a bunch of Romanians, we'd be making fun of Romanians. To not satirize someone just because of their race, I think that would be patronizing and racist in itself.'' Now there's thesis fodder.</p>
        <p>''The bottom line is, I'm not a bigot,'' insists Mr. McGuirk, who put himself through the College of Mount St. Vincent in Riverdale, and earned ''a fluff degree'' in communications, by driving a cab after his father, a city bus driver, kicked him out at 18.</p>
        <p>''I lived amongst blacks all my life,'' he says of his childhood in the James Monroe Houses, where white Irish boys were minority figures. ''I lived in Long Beach in a co-op where the directory read like Schindler's List, for crying out loud. Yes, I arrive at the studio at five a.m. each day, but before I do, on my way out I shine my lawn jockeys, and then I stop at the cemetery and knock over Jewish tombstones. Oh, please.''</p>
        <p>Of Mr. Wallace, he says: ''People can be so humorless: that's what Mike Wallace is, part of the humor Gestapo. The humor Gestapo -- hey, I like that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McGuirk says he and Mr. Imus, who hired him at WNBC in 1987, police themselves on what is and isn't offensive . Here is what the jokesters consider off-limits: ''Overt racism, making fun of cripples or people with cancer, Christopher Reeve jokes . . . there's definitely a line.''</p>
        <p>Not that Mr. McGuirk set out to become a wise guy in what he calls Mr. Imus's Greek Chorus of sycophants and lackeys. He just didn't want to spend his life driving a taxi. After being thrown out by his dad, in a rift that lasted a decade, he spent four years hanging with ''hoodlums,'' entered college at 22, and had an internship at NBC where, on his first day, Mr. Imus made a lasting impression.</p>
        <p>''He had a big drug and alcohol problem then, and he was running around the station in his boxer underwear screaming and cursing at the top of lungs,'' Mr. McGuirk recalls. ''And of course I thought, 'that's the man I want to spend the next 20 years with.' ''</p>
