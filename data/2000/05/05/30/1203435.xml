        <p>A Designer Shows (Yes, Shows) Her Styles</p>
        <p>Not long ago, Elisa Jimenez, a flower-power-minded designer whose answering machine asks callers to ''be well, be blessed,'' sent some dresses encased in hardened clay to a Los Angeles shop, Naked. To see just what a dress looks like, you'd have to crack open the packaging at home.</p>

        <p>A Designer Shows (Yes, Shows) Her Styles</p>
        <p>Not long ago, Elisa Jimenez, a flower-power-minded designer whose answering machine asks callers to ''be well, be blessed,'' sent some dresses encased in hardened clay to a Los Angeles shop, Naked. To see just what a dress looks like, you'd have to crack open the packaging at home.</p>
        <p>''This is going to be a hard thing to sell,'' Steven Russell, an owner of the store, recalls telling Ms. Jimenez. He suggested she send at least one dress in an open case. Ms. Jimenez would not. Buying a dress is all about taking a risk, she told Mr. Russell, and hey, some risks don't work out.</p>
        <p>A commercial instinct is not Ms. Jimenez's forte, she admitted the other day, although she is trying to acquire one. The designer, who is 35 and lives in Hell's Kitchen, sews one-of-a-kind dresses directly on her customers, typically dousing the garments with oils for an aromatherapy effect. Last week, she introduced her first full ready-to-wear line at Kirna Zabete on Greene Street.</p>
        <p>''I need to make some money,'' she said. She has had a following among stylists and celebrities like Courtney Love, but few women with more pedestrian lifestyles buy her clothes.</p>
        <p>The collection consists of one-size-fits-all polymorphous items, like halters that transform into skirts. ''There are about 10 different ways to wear everything,'' said Sarah Hales, an owner of Kirna Zabete, adding that so far Ms. Jimenez's clothes were attracting ''experimental'' customers.</p>
        <p>But some pieces are too advanced even for the daring. Last week, Ms. Hales returned a sequined orange cape to the designer. ''I told her: 'Take this home with you. It's scaring customers.' ''</p>
        <p>Where's the 'Beauty' in Beauty Pageants?</p>
        <p>Beauty pageants are generally not the sort of spectacles that draw people with an aversion to camp -- people like the the German photographer Juergen Teller, who is best known for saturnine fashion images in magazines like Index and W. But last fall, Mr. Teller, a pioneer of the unglamorous documentary style of fashion photography of the 1990's, found himself captivated by the 1999 Miss World Competition in London. He was on assignment from the Goethe Institute of Caracas to take a portrait of Miss Venezuela. Once there, Mr. Teller photographed all 88 contestants.</p>
        <p>''I was pretty much blown away by how determined they all were,'' he said last week. ''They were just standing in front of my camera, each one, and smiling. They were not necessarily smiling at me. When a model smiles at me, I feel she means it to a certain extent.''</p>
        <p>The results of the Miss World project will be on view starting Thursday at the Lehmann Maupin gallery on Greene Street, in Mr. Teller's first commercial exhibition in the United States. The show will also feature images from his ''Go-Sees'' project, candid photographs of aspiring models who visited his London studio, taken in 1998.</p>
        <p>''I looked at their portfolios,'' he said, ''and most of them were much sweeter and more beautiful than they looked in their books.''</p>
        <p>From X-Rays to Image Making</p>
        <p>There is nothing aggressively groovy in Patrick Li's look -- no Yves Saint Laurent suit, no glasses that look like German surgical instruments, nothing suggesting that he landed a job at Interview magazine in 1990, the day after he moved to New York, or wound up as a protege of the graphic designer Fabien Baron. ''I wanted to be a radiologist,'' Mr. Li said in his Mott Street studio recently. ''Look at X-rays, right? They're amazing.''</p>
        <p>With two Paris-based partners, Ezra Petronio and Suzanne Koller, who edit the avant-garde French fashion magazine Self Service, Mr. Li, 31, has become a sought-after image maker in the fashion world. He and his partners have designed ads for Jean Paul Gaultier and packaging for a Commes des Garcons fragrance, Odeur 71. The team was recently asked to help reshape the image of the French fashion house Cacharel, which has just hired the British team of Suzanne Clements and Inacio Ribeiro as head designers.</p>
        <p>''Their work is very graphic and clean,'' Annick Gorman, creative director of Cacharel, said. ''We don't want to be as romantic as we have been.''</p>
        <p>Recently, Karl Lagerfeld asked Mr. Li to produce Chanel's next in-store catalog, which Mr. Lagerfeld has always designed. ''I was, like, 'Karl Lagerfeld -- oh, no!' '' Mr. Li said. ''But behind the fan, there's amazingly little pretense.''</p>
