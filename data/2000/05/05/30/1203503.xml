        <p>After a long weekend of mourning, more than a thousand residents of this small city gathered at a rally to call for an end to violence and to remember a popular teacher slain on Friday by a seventh grader.</p>
        <p>Neighbors, family and students of the teacher, Barry Grunow, 35, held hands and encircled Bryant Park here to remember the teacher. They prayed and talked about ways to prevent yet another school shooting. The slogan of the rally, held aloft on banners and printed on T-shirts was ''stop the violence and nurture the family.''</p>
        <p>Residents called on lawmakers to  take gun control more seriously. If violence could happen in their community, they said, it could happen anywhere.</p>
        <p>''The sad part is, it keeps happening,'' said Barbara Lynch, who has lived in Lake Worth for 15 years. ''It happened to a lovely man, to a community man.''</p>
        <p>As many current and former students cried and embraced at the  rally, they spoke about Mr. Grunow's gentle nature. They said the teacher used to lovingly tease his students, and reward them with cookies and doughnuts.</p>
        <p>''He was the kind of teacher you'll never forget because he believed in hands-on learning,'' said Crystal Bruder, 16, a former student. ''When we were studying Greek mythology in class, he'd have us all dress up, and he made me dress up as a tree for scenery. His lessons were unforgettable.''</p>
        <p>Students said they would remember Mr. Grunow as a friend, a teacher who tried to be approachable.</p>
        <p>''A lot of my friends would go to him when they had problems,'' said Amber Hart, 12, a student of Mr. Grunow's. ''We felt comfortable talking to him. He was so nice. I don't understand why this happened to him.''</p>
        <p>Amber said she also knew 13-year-old Nathaniel Brazill, who is being held in the death of Mr. Grunow.</p>
        <p>The boy had been sent home from school on Friday, the last day of school before summer, for throwing water balloons. According to the police, he returned two hours later with a handgun and shot Mr. Grunow once in the head.</p>
        <p>''Nate was in my advanced math class,'' Amber said. ''He's a nice boy. I don't know why he did that to Mr. Grunow. It's all so confusing.''</p>
        <p>The police said today that two boys had told them that Nathaniel showed them a gun at his home on May 23, said Lt. Raychel Houston, a spokeswoman for the Lake Worth Police Department.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, while searchingNathaniel's room, the police found computer games and magazines featuring helicopters and guns, which suggested that Nathaniel was interested in weapons and the military, Lieutenant Houston said.</p>
        <p>State Attorney Barry Krischer said he would call for a grand jury this week to consider the boy's case. ''It is my intent to try him as an adult,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Helaine Rayman, a Lake Worth resident who organized today's rally, said the solution to school shootings like the one at Lake Worth Middle School was simple.</p>
        <p>''Let's start listening to our children,'' she said. ''Let's be there for them and nurture them like we are supposed to.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Grunow, who was married with two young children, will be buried here on Tuesday morning.</p>
