        <p>Weird things happened in a 20-hour span at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees played two games against two different teams, and those juiced baseballs everybody talks about didn't show up for either game.</p>
        <p>Sure, three home runs were hit in the two games, but that 1.5-a-game average was more than one below the major league average of 2.63.

        <p>Weird things happened in a 20-hour span at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees played two games against two different teams, and those juiced baseballs everybody talks about didn't show up for either game.</p>
        <p>Sure, three home runs were hit in the two games, but that 1.5-a-game average was more than one below the major league average of 2.63. Furthermore, the Yankees, the Boston Red Sox and the Oakland Athletics scored a total of seven runs, only one-third of the 21.4 runs the major leagues average for a pair of games.</p>
        <p>One pitcher, Pedro Martinez of the Red Sox, pitched a shutout Sunday night. Roger Clemens, who pitched against him, had a shutout for eight and two-thirds innings. Yesterday, Andy Pettitte of the Yankees was two outs away from pitching a shutout against the Athletics, the highest-scoring team in the American League.</p>
        <p>If they were using a bag of dead balls that someone slipped into the Yankee Stadium supply, their performances could be more readily understood. But maybe it was their pitching that was responsible for the low scores of the games. Maybe Martinez, Clemens, Pettitte and even Omar Olivares of the Athletics showed that the location of their pitches is more important to the location of the balls after the batters swing at them than the hardness of the ball or the texture of the cover or the height of the seams.</p>
        <p>Pettitte exhibited a simple truism in his two-hit, 4-1 victory over Oakland. If the batters keep hitting the balls on the ground, the balls can't fly over the fences. The Athletics pounded 17 balls into the ground; not one went for a home run.</p>
        <p>Olivares was even smarter in one instance. He threw a triple-play pitch to Shane Spencer yesterday. If Jose Lima of Houston could develop the pitch, he wouldn't be leading the major leagues with 20 home runs allowed. But Olivares didn't just throw a triple-play pitch; he threw an unassisted triple-play pitch.</p>
        <p>Randy Velarde, the Oakland second baseman, was the fielder who made the pitch work, and he became the first player to execute an unassisted triple play in the history of  major league baseball in New York City. According to research by the Elias Sports Bureau, the feat had never been pulled off at a park where the Yankees, the Mets, the Giants or the Dodgers played their home games.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of neat, the first one to get a triple play in the history of the city,'' Olivares said. Without it, he acknowledged, the sixth inning yesterday could have become ''real ugly.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees had scored two runs in the inning and had runners at first and second with no one out. Spencer was the batter, and with the count 3-2, Manager Joe Torre had both men running with the pitch.</p>
        <p>''I was just trying to make the guy hit the ball on the ground somewhere,'' Olivares said. ''I know they are running, so if I get a strikeout we might throw someone out for a double play.''</p>
        <p>Spencer smartly didn't try to pull the changeup. He went the other way with it, toward the right side of the field, but he hit it directly at Velarde.</p>
        <p>Fielders are taught to think, before the pitch, what they will do with the ball if it is hit to them. Infielders, however, never anticipate a triple play. ''What are the chances of that happening?'' Velarde said. ''I think you have a better chance of getting struck by lightning.''</p>
        <p>Unassisted triple plays are one of the rarest, if not the rarest, feats in baseball. Pitchers, for example, have thrown 16 perfect games, including one in a World Series. Batters have hit four home runs in a game 12 times. But infielders have executed unassisted triple plays only 11 times, including once in a World Series.</p>
        <p>Velarde knew exactly what to do when he caught Spencer's soft liner because he had rehearsed it in spring training. That's what spring training is for, isn't it?</p>
        <p>Velarde was playing shortstop in a Yankees exhibition game against the Los Angeles Dodgers after the players' strike ended in 1995. With runners breaking from first and second, Mitch Webster swung at a John Wetteland pitch. ''He hits the exact same soft liner and I catch it,'' Velarde recalled. ''It's just instinctive from there.'' He tagged Eddie Pye coming from first, then stepped on second, which Reggie Williams had vacated.</p>
        <p>In the scenario that counted, Tino Martinez was the runner at second and Jorge Posada the runner at first. ''Everything was right there in front of me,'' Velarde said. ''I know both runners are going. I catch the ball, I see Jorge right there. All I have to do is tag him and take the forceout at second. It was just deja vu. It was wild.''</p>
        <p>Spencer, who said his reaction went from ''hit'' to ''oh'' to ''oh, gosh,'' said he couldn't get upset. ''It happens,'' he said. In fact, when he was told he was the first to make it happen in New York City, he said: ''That's great. It's something to be proud about, I guess.''</p>
        <p>The play certainly served as a different kind of encore to the scintillating pitching duel the previous night between Martinez and Clemens. They pitched a game that will remain one of the best games of the season, even if Eric Chavez was disappointed. Chavez, an Athletics third baseman, and a teammate went to the game, but they left after the eighth inning. ''It was a fun game,'' Chavez said, ''but, oh man, I wish I would have seen a little more hitting.''</p>
