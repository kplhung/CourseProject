        <p>The wildfire that swept through Los Alamos, N.M., this month is setting off alarms across the mountain West, where more and more Americans have chosen to live on the forest's edge.</p>
        <p>Experts say that housing shift has multiplied the danger that fires could kindle similar disasters elsewhere. And the shift is behind an urgent new Congressional quest for millions of dollars in emergency money to try to ease the risk.</p>
        <p>The blaze in Los Alamos, which consumed hundreds of homes, was a pre-emptive fire gone awry. But in communities like Ashland, Ore., and Missoula, Mont., whose populations have swelled with former city dwellers, the fire has served fresh notice that residents sit astride a volatile mix.</p>
        <p>''It's not a matter of if the fire occurs, it's a matter of when,'' said Paul Summerfelt, a top Fire Department official in Flagstaff, Ariz., which is surrounded by the world's largest forest of Ponderosa pines and where half of the 60,000 residents are said to face a severe wildfire risk.</p>
        <p>Across the country, the damage caused by wildfire to homes and property increased sixfold from the 1980's to the 1990's, to a total of $3.2 billion over the last 10 years, federal officials say. In an average year over the past decade, 1,200 homes burned, more than double the number over the previous decade.</p>
        <p>Already this year, more than 40,000 wildfires have consumed more than a million acres, more than in any similar period since 1996.</p>
        <p>With the lesson of Los Alamos in mind, Congress and the Clinton administration are working on a plan that would focus an urgent new round of fire-prevention efforts this summer in the danger zones where populations and wild land meet.</p>
        <p>''As people get their homes closer and closer to nature, they become more and more at risk,'' said Kenneth O. Burris Jr., chief operating officer of the United States Fire Administration, which is based in Emmitsburg, Md.</p>
        <p>The emergency measure is being drawn up by Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, and other Western lawmakers with help from the Forest Service and other federal agencies. It would nearly double, to $115 million from $65 million, the amount of money available to the government this year for efforts intended to prevent wildfires.</p>
        <p>In part, the plan would pay for more prescribed fires, like the one that ignited the Los Alamos blaze, in a fiasco for which the federal government has accepted responsibility. It would also emphasize safer but more costly efforts, relying in part on manual cutting and thinning of the dense, overgrown forests that surround many Western mountain communities and lie at the heart of the fire risk.</p>
        <p>''The events of the past two weeks in New Mexico demonstrate that we cannot simply allow nature to take its course,'' Senator Bingaman wrote in a May 19 letter to Mike Dombeck, the Forest Service chief.</p>
        <p>Fire, of course, is a natural event, but few Western forests remain in their natural state. Experts say the current fire problem is a legacy of the last 100 years, in which most fires have been suppressed and large trees logged, leaving today's forests unnaturally dense, choked with debris and fire-prone.</p>
        <p>Those years of fuel accumulation have made it more likely that even a small fire caused by lightning will spread. That danger is reflected in statistics showing that the number of wildfires that destroy 1,000 acres or more in the United States has increased to a recent average of about 80 a year from 25 a year in 1984.</p>
        <p>But there is no doubt, the experts say, that the wildfire problem has been compounded by rapid population growth in the nation's most forested states, particularly by the building of legions of ranchettes, vacation homes and developments near forest boundaries. That trend has added new fronts to the kind of threat that has long plagued places like Southern California, where population growth into remote canyons and hillsides began several decades ago.</p>
        <p>For one thing, the proximity of people to forests makes it more likely that a cigarette or a lawn mower spark, for example, might ignite a blaze; an estimated 90 percent of wildfires are caused by humans. Of even more concern, the experts say, is the fact that the presence of houses makes forest fires more difficult to control, because priority is given to protecting property, and more difficult to prevent, because traditional fire-prevention methods like controlled burns are often unpopular with residents.</p>
        <p>''We've created a situation in which the forest is like a wood stove,'' said Andy Stahl, executive director of the Association of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics, a group of 13,000 current and former employees that is based in Eugene, Ore. ''We've loaded that stove with paper and shavings and sticks and the like, but now it's sitting in the middle of a living room, and we're telling the forest managers, O.K., take care of this stuff, but don't burn the house down.''</p>
        <p>The Forest Service estimates that some 40 million Americans live in what it calls the ''urban/wildland interface,'' directly adjacent to or scattered within unpopulated areas with wild land vegetation. The agency's estimate does not say how many of those people face a wildfire risk, but separate findings by some fire-prone states leave little doubt that the number is high.</p>
        <p>In California and Colorado alone, officials there say, about three million people face at least a moderate wildfire risk, including the many who have built new homes in recent years in areas like the Sierra Nevada foothills in California and Jefferson County, west of Denver.</p>
        <p>A study by Dave Theobold, a researcher at Colorado State University, focusing on areas within two miles of forest boundaries found that population densities in those once remote parts of the state had quadrupled from 1960 to 1990, even before the last decade's building boom.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, the states with a lot of forests have through most of the last decade shown disproportionate growth and disproportionate home building, and that implies that we're going to have more people living close to the forest than in the past,'' said Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of Homebuilders.</p>
        <p>What happened in Los Alamos has dealt a major setback, at least for now, to prescribed fire, the method most commonly used by federal officials to reduce fire risks on Forest Service and National Park Service lands. In that case, what was to have been a controlled blaze in the Bandelier National Monument quickly spread out of control, ultimately burning more than 46,000 acres.</p>
        <p>The 30-day moratorium on such burning imposed by the federal government remains in effect, and last week Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt extended the ban indefinitely on park service land. Across the West, the example is bound to harden local resistance to the setting of blazes like the one in Los Alamos.</p>
        <p>The main alternative, the manual trimming of countless commercially worthless small-diameter trees, faces problems of its own. It is so costly that the Forest Service has typically enlisted timber companies to do the work as part of contracts that also allow traditional logging activity. But such arrangements have also tended to stir strong opposition from environmental groups.</p>
        <p>For example, in Ashland, Ore., a community popular among wealthy former city dwellers, a Forest Service plan to reduce the risk of a fire that could cut off the city's water supply has been blocked for the last four years by critics opposed to the fact that it would allow timber companies to carry out new logging.</p>
        <p>Frank Carroll, a spokesman for the Potlatch Corporation, a timber company based in Spokane, Wash., criticized such opposition as shortsighted. ''We have got to face reality,'' Mr. Carroll said, ''and what's happening now is that various groups are absolutely bent on a course of catastrophe for communities in the West.''</p>
        <p>As one potential model, some Congressional and administration officials have been looking to a project under way in Flagstaff, where a coalition of government, industry and environmental groups has begun to make a dent in trimming the dense Ponderosa forest that extends even within the city limits.</p>
        <p>Even there, however, opposition from groups like the Forest Guardians, an organization based in Santa Fe, N.M., has acted as a brake. The group opposes what it calls the commercialization of the national forests, and its executive director, Rex Wahl, suggested that residents worried about fire danger should not expect someone else to solve the problem for them.</p>
        <p>''They move to the forest and then they want to get rid of the forest, because it's being touted as a threat to their property,'' Mr. Wahl said. ''They need to take some responsibility for the danger themselves.''</p>
