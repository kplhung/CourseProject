        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The National Education Association is disingenuous when it asserts that home schooling cannot provide a comprehensive education (front page, May 24). Of course, the association can't come right out and say it feels threatened by children leaving or staying out of public schools, which decreases schools' budgets and therefore reduces the amount of money made available for paying and hiring teachers.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The National Education Association is disingenuous when it asserts that home schooling cannot provide a comprehensive education (front page, May 24). Of course, the association can't come right out and say it feels threatened by children leaving or staying out of public schools, which decreases schools' budgets and therefore reduces the amount of money made available for paying and hiring teachers.</p>
        <p>Home schooling parents who do not feel competent enough to guide their children through certain subjects do as we do: they seek out community resources or barter services with other families. When our 12-year-old son took the SAT this year, his score was markedly above that of the average, college-bound 12th-grader -- in spite of the fact that both his father and I shunned mathematics in school. As the saying goes, ''when it comes to school, there's no place like home!''</p>
