        <p>What a Difference An Hour Makes</p>
        <p>NBC's plan to add an hour to the ''Today'' show has executives of ''Live With Regis and Kathie Lee'' checking their deals with 59 NBC-affiliated stations that carry their show, which is also syndicated to 78 ABC stations, 42 CBS stations and 14 Fox stations nationwide. Most, including WABC-TV in New York, carry ''Live'' from 9 to 10 a.m., an hour that the networks have traditionally let local stations fill.</p>

        <p>What a Difference An Hour Makes</p>
        <p>NBC's plan to add an hour to the ''Today'' show has executives of ''Live With Regis and Kathie Lee'' checking their deals with 59 NBC-affiliated stations that carry their show, which is also syndicated to 78 ABC stations, 42 CBS stations and 14 Fox stations nationwide. Most, including WABC-TV in New York, carry ''Live'' from 9 to 10 a.m., an hour that the networks have traditionally let local stations fill.</p>
        <p>For now, no one is certain whether the NBC stations will move ''Live'' to other time slots to make room for the longer ''Today'' show or whether ''Live'' will move to competing local stations that could carry it at 9.</p>
        <p>MICHAEL GELMAN, the executive producer of ''Live,'' said he did not see the extra hour of ''Today'' as a threat, even though it comes as KATHIE LEE GIFFORD is preparing to leave ''Live.''</p>
        <p>''Regis is still the hottest guy on TV,'' Mr. Gelman said, referring to the show's longtime host, REGIS PHILBIN. ''The prime time population is just now appreciating the real talent that he shows in the morning. This show, as a live one-hour, takes a lot more of Regis's skills than 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' does.''</p>
        <p>This much is certain: the longer ''Today'' show will keep the hosts from appearing as guests on each other's shows, as they have done in the last month when Ms. Gifford was on ''Today'' and MATT LAUER of ''Today'' was on ''Live.''</p>
        <p>A Well-Traveled Cigarette Case</p>
        <p>''Small Time Crooks,'' which opened 10 days ago, is not the only Woody Allen film that JOHN TRAINA has had something to do with. Mr. Allen rented a Faberge cigarette case from Mr. Traina, a San Francisco collector, for ''Small Time Crooks.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Traina's son, Trevor, appeared in Mr. Allen's first film, ''Take the Money and Run,'' in 1969. ''We rented him out when he was a baby,'' Mr. Traina said, saying that his one scene zipped by ''in the blink of an eye.''</p>
        <p>''He made his first $50 off of Woody Allen,'' Mr. Traina said. ''We had to get him a Social Security number, and he got a paycheck. At 5 months old, that was pretty good. He's since gone on to sell his company to Microsoft.''</p>
        <p>As for the cigarette case, which served as a present that TRACEY ULLMAN gives to HUGH GRANT, it went to New York twice. ''Woody Allen asked for it back a second time to film it again,'' Mr. Traina said. ''I was almost sorry I got it back. They insured it for $1 million. These things are expensive, but that's way too high.''</p>
        <p>Keeping a Story In the Family</p>
        <p>Last month, PAUL D. POPE announced a $1 million reward for information about the death of his father, Generoso Pope Jr., the owner and publisher of The National Enquirer, who died in 1998. At the time, the authorities said the death was from a heart attack. But Paul Pope, a 32-year-old venture capitalist, says he has never been satisfied with explanations of what he calls his father's ''mysterious death'' at 61.</p>
        <p>Now he has chosen a co-author for a book on his family: SAM GIANCANA, the nephew, godson and namesake of a notorious Chicago organized-crime figure.</p>
        <p>''From meeting different writers, from the Norman Mailers of the world to Dan Moldea, it was frustrating because they didn't get the material,'' said Mr. Pope, who also wants the book to cover his grandfather, Generoso Pope Sr., who founded the  Italian-language New York newspaper Il Progresso. (Mr. Moldea wrote ''Dark Victory: Ronald Reagan, MCA and the Mob,'' which alleged that the Justice Department under Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy had subpoenaed Mr. Reagan's tax returns from the 1950's.)</p>
        <p>''The other gentlemen authors, they focused more on The Enquirer, which isn't the story,'' Mr. Pope continued. ''Then I met with Sam. Within 15 minutes, he understood the power my grandfather wielded over the politicians, the intelligence community. The others, you could sit there for years and try to explain it to them, but unless you lived in that world, how would you know? Sam understands.''</p>
