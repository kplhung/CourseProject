        <p>The sun sidled up over Manhattan ever so quietly yesterday, indifferent to the chill of the air. It matched the mood of the city: introverted, solitary, almost secretive.</p>
        <p>Deserters who thought that they were leaving the city to be overrun by holiday tourists could think again. What they left behind was a muted New York, with sparse streets and unhurried pedestrians.</p>
        <p>With summer, like a watched pot, refusing to boil, everything seemed subdued and, after a frenzied weekend, eerily serene. Taxis scudded through Times Square with nary a honk. A movie director could not have arranged for sidewalks so modestly populated. At a Starbucks, the young baristas who usually juggle orders from a crowd four deep took it easy while a man in a black velvet coat and black shades napped in an overstuffed armchair.</p>
        <p>Even the shoppers on 34th Street moved more as if nursing hangovers than hunting down Memorial Day bargains. Those who normally considered themselves lucky to get a seat in the small sliver in the center of Herald Square presided over entire tables. Enisa Terzic, a Macy's clerk with cropped dark hair and lips lined in black, read her copy of Cosmopolitan with as much composure as if she were sitting in the window of Dean &amp; DeLuca's.</p>
        <p>But for Rene Ramirez, a Barnes &amp; Noble deliveryman, and many others who tried to conduct business yesterday, the ease of getting around, and in Mr. Ramirez's case, the promise of $3 instead of $2 for every book that safely reached its purchaser, did not make up for the absence of people. ''Today, maybe a lot of people go upstate or to other places, and it's not easy to find them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At a street fair on Madison Avenue below 53rd Street, business was hardly any better for Paul's Concessions, a sausage stand. ''I got a break all day long,'' carped Paul's son, Eric Behling, 31, giving away two corn dogs.</p>
        <p>At the Empire State Building, the yards of velvet rope used to control traffic hung undisturbed and unemployed. What was usually a three- to four-hour wait had dropped to 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>''This is the deadest I've ever seen it for Memorial Day,'' said Joey Lopez, an observatory guard, shaking his head as though in sorrow for all those who would miss the sight of four states from one spot. ''It's unlimited today. The view is impeccable.''</p>
        <p>Theories. There were theories. ''I think a lot of people come to New York for the shows, and there are no shows today,'' said Marie Burke, up from Boston for the shows and a little shopping.</p>
        <p>Behind her, a Japanese woman had pulled a chair up to Bryant Park's grassy lawn as if it were a breakfast table, and sat down to peruse her newspaper. She did not have much to say, not even her name. ''I'm just enjoying this solitariness,'' was all she would venture.</p>
        <p>Resting together on the largely vacant steps of the main branch of the New York Public Library, two retired women from Flatbush, Brooklyn, who had walked uptown after shopping, made their guesses.</p>
        <p>''Everyone's going to the parade, and I think it's not high summer yet,'' Elsie Fabio said. Then, she conjectured that it was simply a matter of locale. ''While we were walking up, everyone seemed to be going down,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But even the usually clogged sidewalks of SoHo were free-flowing enough to attract even those accustomed to avoiding that part of town. Susan and Jason Salgado, TriBeCa residents who identified themselves as ''members of the financial community,'' had come home early from a weekend in Syracuse just for the pleasure of having the city (almost) to themselves. ''That's what we love about New York, finding times when the city is less crowded,'' Mrs. Salgado said.</p>
        <p>The afternoon shadows were lengthening, people were returning from their long weekends, and the air was beginning once more to strum and vibrate. A not-so-distant car honked. But the Salgados grinned at each other, the errands they had saved up for weeks completed, and a few shopping bags over Mr. Salgado's arm. ''It just has a very kind of European feel to it, just walking out on the streets,'' he said. ''Nothing to do, nowhere to go. We don't have to be any place.''</p>
