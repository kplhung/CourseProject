        <p>Correction of May 25 article on proposed regulations to limit arsenic in tap water</p>
      </abstract>
    </body.head>
    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A front-page article on Thursday about proposed regulations to limit arsenic in tap water referred incorrectly to estimates of the cancer risk under the proposed standard of five parts per billion. The Environmental Protection Agency's estimate of risk, approximately 1 in 10,000, pertains only to bladder cancer, the most thoroughly studied health risk, and does not reflect other forms of cancer that can also be caused by arsenic.</p>
        <p>The article also referred incompletely to environmentalists' threat of a lawsuit if the Clinton administration did not propose the new regulations quickly. The Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group, filed such a suit on May 10 to force the release of the proposal.</p>
