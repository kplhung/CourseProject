        <p>While the Ford Motor Company recently acknowledged that sport utility vehicles can be hazardous to other motorists, law professors and plaintiff lawyers say that it remains difficult to win lawsuits based on the damage that sport utilities inflict in crashes.</p>
        <p>Trial lawyers and automakers say that they are aware of only one lawsuit so far in which a car occupant has sued the manufacturer of the sport utility that hit her. That case, against Land Rover, was summarily dismissed in January by a Superior Court judge in Los Angeles who concluded that the automaker had no legal duty to consider what would happen to other vehicles and motorists struck by its products.</p>
        <p>Still, some plaintiff lawyers say that even before Ford's recent pronouncements, they were searching for cases in which tall sport utilities overrode cars. ''We're just waiting for the right case to come along, where someone isn't sodden with alcohol or going 100 miles an hour,'' said Robert Palmer, a lawyer in Springfield, Mo., who is the vice president of the Attorneys Information Exchange Group, a national group of trial lawyers who sue automakers.</p>
        <p>Legal scholars say that while Ford and other sport utility makers have a strong legal case, liability law can evolve quickly in response to shifts in public sentiment, as shown by recent litigation against tobacco companies and gun makers.</p>
        <p>''If I were the Ford Motor Company, I wouldn't treat this very cavalierly, but at this point in the development of tort law, they have the better argument,'' said Roger C. Henderson, a law professor at the University of Arizona. Most legal experts agree that Ford's recent acknowledgment of the dangers posed to occupants of other vehicles by sport utility vehicles is unlikely to help trial lawyers. The legal issue is not whether sport utilities are particularly deadly to other motorists, but whether that deadliness results in legal liability for automakers.</p>
        <p>The manufacturers have lost many lawsuits over the years in which they were accused of designing automobiles that inadequately protect occupants during crashes. Some of the suits have involved occupants injured or killed when sport utilities rolled over. But successful suits holding automakers liable for the harm that their products cause to other vehicles and their occupants are another matter.</p>
        <p>In a report distributed at its annual shareholders meeting in Atlanta on May 11, Ford attributed the heavy damage inflicted during crashes by sport utilities and other so-called light trucks to the big vehicles' design -- not just their weight.</p>
        <p>''Trucks are also built with a more rigid frame and higher stance --  important for towing and hauling cargo -- but this means that the stiff parts of the truck may not engage all the parts of a car designed to absorb impact,'' the company said, vowing to continue its efforts to find solutions.</p>
        <p>Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for safety and the environment, said that sport utility manufacturers and their customers were not exposed to litigation because the vehicles were not defective or negligently designed. She depicted the report as containing a scientific discussion of sport utility safety rather than an admission of defects or negligence in design.</p>
        <p>Manufacturers have several strong defenses against litigation involving damage and injuries caused by sport utilities during crashes. Legal tradition holds that makers of large cars, pickups and trailer trucks are not liable just because these vehicles inflict severe damage on small cars during crashes. Trucks and large cars need to be big to haul freight and plenty of people. And most state courts allow some balancing of a product's usefulness with its risk to society, along with the cost of design changes to reduce those risks.</p>
        <p>But a few legal experts suggest that sport utilities may not pass muster on this balancing of risk and usefulness. Richard Friedman, a law professor at the University of Michigan, questioned whether off-road capability -- for which they have high ground clearance and high bumpers -- justified the extra damage and injuries caused when the tall vehicles override cars' bumpers and door sills in crashes.</p>
        <p>Such arguments are quite theoretical. In an actual crash, it is very difficult for experts, much less juries, to distinguish between damage caused by sport utilities' height and damage caused by their considerable weight.</p>
        <p>Large, heavy cars have always done a lot of damage to other vehicles, though they are far less likely than sport utilities to kill the other motorist in a crash. The line between heavy cars and sport utilities has been blurred by the introduction of vehicles like the Lexus RX300, which is essentially a tall Toyota Camry wagon with all-wheel drive.</p>
        <p>Much of the evidence on the deadliness of sport utilities is based on national statistics, rather than specific crashes. Midsize sport utilities are three times as likely as midsize cars to kill the other driver in a crash. This is true even though occupants of midsize sport utilities are also more likely to die in crashes than occupants of midsize cars. That is because the sport utilities are more prone to rolling over and have limited crumple zones.</p>
        <p>Such statistics tend to be easier to use in a class-action lawsuit rather than a specific personal injury claim, but it is unclear whether people hit by sport utilities represent what courts would accept as a legal class. The usual basis for establishment of such a class is a contractual relationship between a manufacturer and the people who are harmed -- when people buy a defective product, for example. No such relationship exists between automakers and people who have been hit by sport utilities.</p>
        <p>Only recently have some courts allowed class-action lawsuits by people without such contractual relationships, notably by people who sued tobacco companies because they were exposed to colleagues' second-hand smoke. But such class-action cases remain uncommon.</p>
        <p>''There isn't any clear duty by Ford to other motorists, they owe a duty to their customers,'' said John C. Coffee, a Columbia law professor.</p>
        <p>There are also no federal regulations requiring automakers to limit the damage that their products may inflict. Sport utilities are specifically exempt from federal regulations on bumper height, so as to preserve their off-road driving capability. Land Rover emphasized the absence of bumper-height regulations in persuading Judge Jan A. Pluim of the Los Angeles Superior Court earlier this year to dismiss the lawsuit filed against it by Diane Y. Diaz de Veer, who suffered brain injuries when her Saab was hit by a Range Rover. Arnold Schwartz, the woman's lawyer, said he would appeal.</p>
        <p>Some lawyers believe that by forthrightly addressing sport utilities' problems now, Ford may have actually reduced its potential exposure to large verdicts for punitive damages. Indeed, Ford may have transferred some of its liability to owners of sport utilities. ''It was a very wise statement for them to make because they're putting the world on notice that if you're in a sport utility and drive it negligently, then you could be responsible,'' said Ralph Knowles, a plaintiff lawyer in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, a particularly gruesome aspect of accidents involving sport utility vehicles also discourages plaintiff lawyers from filing lawsuits over their designs. Statistics show the high front ends of sport utilities make them more likely to hit other motorists in the head, neck and upper torso and kill them, instead of crippling them with injuries to the waist or leg. Large liability awards tend to go to people who are severely injured but survive to provide vivid testimony.</p>
        <p>Mr. Palmer said that he had just turned down a sport utility case mainly because the car driver had died in the crash. Preparing a lawsuit that breaks new legal ground costs $200,000 to $400,000, he said, adding, ''A wrongful death case in most parts of the country is just not worth a lot of money.''</p>
