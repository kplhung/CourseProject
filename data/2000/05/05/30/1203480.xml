        <p>After 14 years in the beer-making business, Richard Doyle, a founder of the Mass. Bay Brewing Company, no longer pays much attention to the humid, bready scent of barley malt and yeast bubbling over into foam-topped buckets. But the smell is still comforting, reminding him that the brewery is running all out,  producing nearly two million gallons of Harpoon beer a year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Doyle recently added a sixth 24-hour production day to the brewery's workweek. Indeed, business is as good as it ever was at the height of the specialty beer boom in the mid-1990's.</p>
        <p>But some of his colleagues in the Massachusetts microbrewing industry have not been so fortunate. Local brewers like Bristol, Middlesex, Pilgrim and Old Newbury have all closed their doors. Thinking back on the boom, Mr. Doyle, who is also chairman of the Brewers Association of America, described the rush to market as a busy intersection without a traffic light.</p>
        <p>''There was so much product going through, it was just crashing,'' he said. ''We needed time to kind of tow it all away.''</p>
        <p>The craze in the 1990's for craft-brewed beers with a variety of tastes (and names) suddenly jammed store aisles with fanciful brews like Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsner, Long Trail Double Bag Ale, Rogue Shakespeare Stout and Pig's Eye Pilsner. For consumers used to basic labels like Coors and Bud, it was a bit much. Some microbrewers collided with distributors who refused to carry their products and financiers who clamored for profits even as sales slowed.</p>
        <p>As a consequence, for the first time, more microbreweries in the United States closed last year than opened. And more bottles will head for the clearance shelves this year.</p>
        <p>But those craft brewers that lived through the shake-up -- and there are many -- are telling a tale of leaner, more economical brewing, more conservative growth and more thoughtful business plans. They are taking a breather before making another, more sober run on the American beer market, which is dominated by three companies that have 80 percent of the market: Anheuser-Busch; Miller Brewing, a unit of Philip Morris; and Coors.</p>
        <p>Above all, the independent beer makers say they are paying more respect to their roots. The craft beer industry grew at a euphoric rate of 50 percent in both 1994 and 1995, spurring some regional brewers --  heady as prom queens with their local popularity -- to rush their products into new markets. But when  growth stalled in 1997 and 1998, many retreated to their home states and the comforting loyalty of customers in their own backyards.</p>
        <p>Deschutes Brewery of Bend, Ore., stopped shipments to Colorado and San Diego. Pyramid of Seattle and the Breckenridge Brewing Company in Denver cut back on their out-of-state attempts as well.</p>
        <p>What they found, said David Edgar, president of the Institute for Brewing Studies in Colorado, was that beer drinkers in Oregon had a special affection for their Black Butte Porter, and Alabamans stuck with their Red Mountain Red Ale.</p>
        <p>''The industry will always be primarily about local beers,'' he said. ''The lesson was learned that just because you were the cat's meow in Portland doesn't mean that automatically consumers are going to embrace your brand as strongly in Seattle.''</p>
        <p>The Shipyard Brewing Company in Maine, for one, began on the Kennebunk River in 1992, but within a few years expanded into New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Chicago, Florida and parts of Virginia. Then sales slumped. Shipyard retrenched to New England, where it currently sells 75 percent of its product. Fred M. Forsely, its co-founder, has not given up thoughts of going national, but meanwhile he is coping with ''being able to accept a small piece of a very loyal market.''</p>
        <p>''If we go to Chicago again,'' he said with humility, ''we won't expect to sell three trailer loads a month again.''</p>
        <p>There have been a handful of closings in New York as well. In upstate New York, where the trend was slow to dig in, there are about a dozen working microbreweries, including Brewery Ommegang in Cooperstown, which opened in 1998, and Flying Bison in Buffalo, which began brewing last year. All have set their sights on the local market, which gives them good odds of succeeding, said Bill Metzger, a trade publisher in Buffalo.</p>
        <p>Many brewers call New York City a hard market to break into. But the Brooklyn Brewery built a loyal following by handling its own distribution. Sales have grown consistently since it began in 1988, said Stephen Hindy, president and co-founder. Last year, Brooklyn Brewery sold 32,000 barrels, 80 percent of them in the metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>''It was a slow way to grow, but owning our own trucks and doing our own deliveries has taught us a lot about the beer business,'' Mr. Hindy said. ''We know a lot about what our customers are saying.''</p>
        <p>At the Sunset Grill and Tap in Boston, which offers about 60 American craft brews from its 112 taps, beer enthusiasts still sample the occasional seasonal Summer Wheat Ale or Octoberfest brew. But instead of jumping on the new brand of the month, drinkers generally stick with established products from Sam Adams (made by Boston Beer and the biggest and best-advertised craft beer in the country), Sierra Nevada (a best-seller from California) and New England makers like Vermont's Magic Hat and the Tremont Brewery, a tiny Boston producer.</p>
        <p>''A lot of it, at this point, is just credibility,'' said Marc Kadish, the bar's owner. ''Breweries change, and the owners change. Or it's simply not fresh. Somebody takes a chance, tries an interesting microbrew and is disappointed. Why do people go to McDonald's? It's consistent, and people know what they're going to get.''</p>
        <p>Even very good beer makers ran into problems. Some, expecting the euphoria of the beer craze to continue, poured borrowed money into beer-making and were caught with a lot of shiny equipment to make too much beer for too few drinkers. Catamount, Vermont's first microbrewery, completed a $5 million dollar plant just as growth began to top out. It closed last month.</p>
        <p>The Frederick Brewing Company of Maryland found itself in a similar predicament in 1997. It built an $8 million beer-making plant with a 100,000-barrel annual capacity, but wound up producing only about 32,000 barrels there. Last year, Frederick was bought by the Snyder International Brewing Group of Ohio.</p>
        <p>Irene Firmat, a founder of the Oregon-based Full Sail, has seen several brewers in her region merge or consolidate. Others continue to struggle with whether to go public, stay private or form a partnership with an industry giant. Her own company faced the same question when two of her partners recently wanted out of the business. Full Sail employees bought them out in 1999, and the brewery is now worker-owned.</p>
        <p>Ms. Firmat credits Full Sail's survival, in part, to the Pacific Northwest's taste for better beer. ''Craft beer is part of the consciousness of the region,'' she said, pointing out that special brews account for about 10 percent of beer sales in the area, as opposed to about 3 percent nationally. ''That helps a lot to buffer the changes in the industry.''</p>
        <p>One change was increased competition from imported beers. If a customer was willing to spend a little more for a six pack, it turned out he was more likely to buy a brand that had been around for 50 years than 50 days. East Coast brewers in particular felt the competition of brands like Heineken, Corona and Bass, which helped push consumption of imports to 9.2 percent of the American market last year.</p>
        <p>The craft beer promoters have themselves to blame.</p>
        <p>''In general, tastes have definitely developed,'' said Mr. Kadish, the bar owner. ''People were so scared of the imports and the dark beers, and now I.P.A. is a household word.'' As with India Pale Ales, customers barely sputter when they order a Bitburger, Warstiener or Hackerphscorr.</p>
        <p>To further erode consumer confidence, the megabrewers played an awkward role in the specialty beer field. The large beer makers answered the call for unique beers with their own homespun-sounding labels, including Anheuser-Busch's Red Wolf, Coors's Killian's Red and Miller's Red Dog. As if that scarlet trio were not confusing enough, consumers were unsure whether they were drinking a hometown favorite or a quaintly packaged version of a megabrew.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, some smaller companies, eager for expansion money, became megabrewer protectorates. Miller, the Milwaukee-based giant, bought a 50 percent stake in the fast-growing Shipyard in 1995. In exchange, Shipyard gained access to Miller's laboratories and, probably most important, its distribution system. But Miller apparently lost interest when Shipyard's barrel production dropped from 39,500 in 1996, to 25,300 in 1998. Last month, Shipyard announced it was taking on some debt to buy back those shares.</p>
        <p>Despite the recent doldrums, industry analysts are optimistic. Beer sales increased 1.6 percent last year, primarily because the prime beer drinking population, considered to be people (mostly men) in their 20's and early 30's, is also up. Beer prices, which have lagged behind inflation for some 15 years, have climbed.</p>
        <p>There are still over 420 small brewers in the United States -- up from about 200 in 1994 -- and their stories are as varied as their labels. Together, sales at four of the largest specialty brewers -- Boston Beer, Pete's Wicked, Redhook and Pyramid -- fell 24 percent between 1996 and 1999. Yet half of the top 50 craft brewers had double digit sales growth last year.</p>
        <p>Some have been blissfully unaffected by the turmoil. New Belgium sales were up more than 40 percent last year. Sierra Nevada, the second-largest craft brewer in the United States, has grown right along since its founding in 1981, increasing its sales nearly 15 percent last year and 26 percent the year before.</p>
        <p>Mr. Doyle, the beer association chairman, said resisting the temptation to go for maximum growth  helped his Harpoon Brewery keep its footing as others around him slipped. ''We were not leveraged, we're not highly leveraged now,'' he said. ''Our focus was making sure that we were very profitable at the size we were, to store up resources for the time when the industry thawed again.''</p>
        <p>So far this year, most of the specialty brands have reported an upturn in sales, said Frank C. Walters, the director of research for the trade newsletter Impact. ''A lot of the streamlining, getting rid of the deadwood brands, we think was probably completed in the last half of 1999,'' he said. ''Things are starting to grow again.''</p>
        <p>Shakeouts have their advantages. At the National Craft Brewers Conference in Milwaukee last month, attendees were mostly experienced brewers interested in seminars like Hopping to Perfection and The Biodiversity of Yeast. There were fewer newcomers looking to hop on a bandwagon. ''These events used to be full of tire kickers,'' said Gary Fish, president of the Deschutes Brewery. ''There's not so many of those people any more.''</p>
