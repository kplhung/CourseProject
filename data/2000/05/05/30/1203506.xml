        <p>NEW YORKERS being a highly knowledgeable lot, Knicks fans even dispense advice on the proper way to dress before a game.</p>
        <p>''Tie 'em tight,'' somebody shouted to Latrell Sprewell yesterday afternoon, as he laced up the sneaker on his injured left foot.</p>
        <p>Ever solicitous, the fans wanted to see the most possible support of the tiny fractured bone, and they had other advice bordering on the inspirational for the assorted walking wounded. This was before the Knicks stunned the fans -- but probably not themselves -- by embarrassing Indiana, 91-89, to tie this series at two games apiece.</p>
        <p>It perhaps should be no surprise, since the Knicks jolted the Pacers the same way last year, also without Patrick Ewing. In the process, the Knicks have turned the corner from a headstrong and occasionally loutish bunch in the Pat Riley era to gallant and even resourceful players under Jeff Van Gundy who fit into the demanding standards of New York fans.</p>
        <p>The fans were looking for miracles when the day began. The Knicks' predicament was stated quite baldly on the pregame lineup notes:</p>
        <p>Patrick Ewing: ''Acute peroneal tendinitis right foot, day to day.''</p>
        <p>Marcus Camby: ''Sprained medial capsule, right knee, day to day.''</p>
        <p>Latrell Sprewell: ''Incomplete fracture of fifth metatarsal, left foot, day to day.''</p>
        <p>This is a serious load of injuries. The players reported for pregame workouts looking pretty good. Of course, they were well rested, having snoozed on the training tables while the training staff performed miracles on damaged tissue.</p>
        <p>The trainers, meanwhile, looked positively awful. Mike Saunders and Said Hamdan looked as if they had not slept in days, which, of course, they had not. ''We pulled out all the stops today,'' Hamdan said.</p>
        <p>Normally, the trainers do not report to the Westchester County training site before a day game, but there was work to be done, so Hamdan made the long schlep from Nassau County to the Connecticut border to administer to the legions. ''I've been in restaurants and bakeries with shorter lines for a table or a loaf,'' Hamdan said.</p>
        <p>The work paid off in bodies, since Spree and Camby were able to stay in uniform for the game, while Ewing had to change into a handsome dark striped suit, and do his best work waving an orange rally towel.</p>
        <p>''There wasn't any question of how hard they would play,'' Van Gundy said. ''The question is whether they'd be able to play.''</p>
        <p>It is to the credit of the Knicks and the league that they disclosed the injuries. This would never happen in hockey, where teams conveniently forget to disclose minor details like broken bones and wrenched joints, for the very good reason that somebody on the other side would be sure to test that injury early.</p>
        <p>Such opportunism seemed beyond the Pacers, sportsmen to the core. In the absence of Ewing, the Pacers rarely lobbed the ball to the 7-foot-4-inch Dutchman, Rik Smits, to try to isolate Smits for his characteristic soft shots.</p>
        <p>The Pacers seemed to want to win fair and square, perhaps confirming Larry Bird's own worst suspicions about his team, that it does not know how to finish off a damaged opponent.</p>
        <p>Yesterday brought back memories of last year, when Ewing was also wobbly, when the Pacers appeared on a straight path to the finals, only to have uproarious things happen. For the record: the Knicks won in six games.</p>
        <p>It seems almost laughable that the Knicks could be so smooth, so fine, so accurate, with so many injuries. Sprewell seemed to have plenty of forward leap, but his lateral moves were suspect. Camby was visibly hobbling, and Van Gundy saved him for a late spurt.</p>
        <p>Late in the game, the fans applauded the Knicks. These were not the artificial cheers spurred on by the witless sounds from the public-address system, but rather the warm and impromptu sounds of fans who had gotten more out of this cool, sweet Memorial Day weekend than they ever could have imagined.</p>
        <p>The franchise that had self-destructed in fights and suspensions in the past is now showing the resourcefulness that New York fans used to expect. One glaring statistic from the Indiana playoff series of last year and this is that the Knicks have now won five and lost one when Ewing could not play at all. Van Gundy said this fact has been ''manipulated'' by the news media, but it is a fact nonetheless.</p>
        <p>The trainers are working on Ewing's tendinitis for Game 5. The few traveling Knicks fans will no doubt dispense medical, emotional and strategic advice tomorrow night in Indiana, too.</p>
