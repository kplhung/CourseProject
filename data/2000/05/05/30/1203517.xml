        <p>Winning a golf tournament is not supposed to look as easy as Tiger Woods made it look today.</p>
        <p>Woods was like the driver of a car on cruise control, and he was never forced to hit the gas. There was a fleeting moment on the back nine when Ernie Els closed within four strokes, but Woods birdied the next hole and Els bogeyed to fall six strokes behind again.</p>
        <p>Forget drama. Woods prefers dominance. Starting the day with a six-stroke lead at the Memorial Tournament, Woods eased to a five-stroke victory over Els and Justin Leonard in an event that ended one day late because of rain.</p>
        <p>But for Woods, who won $558,000, the wait was worth it. Finishing at 269 (71-63-65-70), 19 under par, Woods bogeyed the final hole to fall one stroke short of the tournament record, 268, set by Tom Lehman in 1994. But that was hardly a concern for Woods, who captured his 19th PGA Tour victory today at age 24, tying Ben Crenshaw for the most victories among active full-time tour players. Woods also became the first player to win the Memorial in back-to-back years, as he successfully defended a tournament for the first time in his career.</p>
        <p>Think Woods is ready for next month's United States Open at Pebble Beach? Consider this. He is the only tour player with four victories this season. He leads the money list with more than $4.1 million. And in his last 20 starts on tour, he has 11 victories and 18 top 10 finishes.</p>
        <p>No wonder Woods is looking forward to Pebble Beach. His game is more consistent than ever.</p>
        <p>''That's something I've been working toward,'' Woods said. ''That's what you're supposed to do, continue to try and get better. It doesn't mean you're going to get better, but I'm trying to get better. I'm trying to give myself chances in every tournament I play.''</p>
        <p>Woods was presented the winner's trophy by Jack Nicklaus, the tournament host, who won 18 professional major championships, the record Woods covets most. After watching Woods overwhelm the Muirfield Village Golf Club course that Nicklaus designed, while averaging 298.9 yards in driving distance, Nicklaus was asked to compare his game in his prime to Woods's.</p>
        <p>''If I was hitting the ball the way I wanted to, I always felt like everybody else was going to play for second,'' said Nicklaus, who at age 60 tied for 65th place after a final-round 73. ''I think he feels the same way. Nobody in golf today can stand there with a driver and say, 'I'm going to hit the ball 295 yards and shape it the way I want to shape it and put it on that side of the fairway.' He is the only guy that can do that.</p>
        <p>''I think he manages his game well. I managed my game well. I think he can play right-to-left or left-to-right. He probably plays better right-to-left than I did. He's got a far better short game than I ever had. His short game is phenomenal. He's got every shot around the green. He's a terrific putter, but I think I was a good putter, too.''</p>
        <p>Woods ended any chance for suspense early, with birdies on Nos. 3, 6 and 8 to reach 20 under par. Terrific approach shots set up each birdie. At No. 3, he hit a pitching wedge shot to 6 feet from the hole. At No. 6, he hit a 9-iron to 4 feet. At No. 8, he hit a 9-iron to 6 feet.</p>
        <p>From that point, his march toward victory was almost a formality. Els had the best round of the day, a 65, while Leonard was solid with a final-round 68. But Els and Leonard were playing for second place. And when Els was asked what he would do if Woods got even better, he had to smile.</p>
        <p>''He's 24,'' Els said. ''I guess he's got to get better. In his own mind, he can get better. In everybody else's mind, he's probably as good as we want to see him.''</p>
        <p>It was Leonard's first top 10 finish this year, and he hoped it signaled the end to his slump.</p>
        <p>''I told myself that no matter how I played today I was going to take some positives from this week,'' Leonard said. ''This is the first time I even came close to putting four rounds together.''</p>
        <p>Woods does not seem to need much, and no matter how much he wins, the feeling never gets old. ''It's not easy, especially how deep the fields are now,'' he said. ''I appreciate every victory I get.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>GREG NORMAN, who started the final round tied for 50th place, withdrew because he had a meeting today with Gov. JEB BUSH of Florida. . . . TIGER WOODS's five-stroke victory was the widest winning margin on tour since PAUL AZINGER won the Sony Open in Hawaii by seven strokes in January.</p>
