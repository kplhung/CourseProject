        <p>Anthony Tommasini reviews New York Philharmonic performing Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7, the Leningrad, and Lowell Liebermann's Concerto for Trumpet and Orchestra under direction of Kurt Masur at Avery Fisher Hall; photo (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>As with many of Shostakovich's works the subtext of the Symphony No. 7, the ''Leningrad,'' has long been  debated. It was composed in 1941-42, when the city was under siege by invading German forces. Is the work essentially program music, a depiction of brutal attackers and a beleaguered people? Or is there a secret anti-Stalinist protest buried in it, as some claim? Is this tumultuous 70-minute symphony to be heard as a bitter, sarcastic outcry or the musical equivalent of poster art?</p>
        <p>Kurt Masur is clearly enthralled with the work, and his performance with the New York Philharmonic on Thursday night at Avery Fisher Hall was fascinating. He pays special attention to every passage, every stretch of the score where the music turns introspective and quizzical, making the work seem more subtle and complex. Even the extended march segment in the first movement, which, like Ravel's ''Bolero,'' builds up from quiet stirrings to bombastic outbursts, came off here as dramatic and inexorable though this is the very music that Bartok parodied in his Concerto for Orchestra.</p>

        <p>As with many of Shostakovich's works the subtext of the Symphony No. 7, the ''Leningrad,'' has long been  debated. It was composed in 1941-42, when the city was under siege by invading German forces. Is the work essentially program music, a depiction of brutal attackers and a beleaguered people? Or is there a secret anti-Stalinist protest buried in it, as some claim? Is this tumultuous 70-minute symphony to be heard as a bitter, sarcastic outcry or the musical equivalent of poster art?</p>
        <p>Kurt Masur is clearly enthralled with the work, and his performance with the New York Philharmonic on Thursday night at Avery Fisher Hall was fascinating. He pays special attention to every passage, every stretch of the score where the music turns introspective and quizzical, making the work seem more subtle and complex. Even the extended march segment in the first movement, which, like Ravel's ''Bolero,'' builds up from quiet stirrings to bombastic outbursts, came off here as dramatic and inexorable though this is the very music that Bartok parodied in his Concerto for Orchestra.</p>
        <p>Ultimately the symphony's flaw is its length. Almost any stretch of 5 or 10 minutes is riveting. But the work runs on and inevitably seems ponderous. The Philharmonic played it magnificently for Mr. Masur. Their performance can also be heard on a new Teldec recording.</p>
        <p>The concert began with the premiere of a Concerto for Trumpet and Orchestra by Lowell Liebermann, a lifelong New Yorker who is 39 and very successful. With three degrees from Juilliard, Mr. Liebermann brings clear skills to his work. But here his accessible Neo-Romantic musical language seems tame and derivative.</p>
        <p>Wanting to explore the lyrical qualities of the trumpet in the first movement, he gives the soloist a breezy melody that is spun out over the lapping arpeggios of the orchestra's accompaniment. Mr. Liebermann says that after completing this movement he realized to his surprise that the main melody was rather like that favorite ditty of trumpeters, ''The Carnival of Venice.'' That the concerto's melody is so similar in contour and mood suggests that Mr. Liebermann was not working too hard to be original.</p>
        <p>As the music proceeds, the melody is picked up by the violins playing in gushy unison. The harmony is spiked with ''wrong note'' dissonance, but the result is very tepid. The molto adagio second movement begins with a sort of wistful chorale and church bell chimes. The last movement is a slapstick comedy, the composer says, but the galumphing humor is heavy-handed.</p>
        <p>The problem for any composer working in such a derivative vein is the inevitable comparisons with the original models. You are tempted to say that this music was better when Barber wrote it. Or, in this case, Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev as well. Still, the concerto certainly offered Philip Smith, the principal trumpet of the Philharmonic since 1978, ample opportunity to display his brilliant technique, elegant lyricism and wide range of colors.</p>
        <p>Thursday night was the annual occasion for plaques and speeches in honor of retiring orchestra players. The cellist Lorin Bernsohn, retiring after 42 years, and the bassoonist David Carroll, retiring after 16 years, were enthusiastically applauded, as was in absentia the clarinetist Michael Burgio, retiring after 40 years.</p>
