        <p>Vice President Al Gore commemorated the nation's war dead today by recounting his own military experiences in Vietnam and the complex web of emotions, from patriotism to family devotion to guilt, that caused him to enlist three decades ago.</p>
        <p>In a speech before several hundred people gathered for a Memorial Day ceremony here, Mr. Gore acknowledged that his five months in Vietnam as an Army reporter had not been the most grueling or dangerous, saying, ''I know that my service doesn't in any way match that of the heroes we honor on this day.''</p>
        <p>But his time in a combat zone taught him much about sacrifice, honor and loyalty among soldiers, he said in a speech largely devoid of policy, politics or any mention of his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>''Those veterans who are here, whether you served in Vietnam or Korea, the Persian Gulf or World War II or another conflict, you have that bond with those you served with,'' he told the crowd in this small town along the Monongahela River just south of Pittsburgh. ''You felt the same feelings. You saw the same things. You made the same sacrifices.''</p>
        <p>Governor Bush, who was a fighter pilot in the Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam War, attended another Memorial Day event, delivering brief remarks that were less personal than Mr. Gore's but that also steered mostly clear of politics and the presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>''What do we owe the brave?'' he said to several hundred veterans, local residents and Army men and women outside the Killeen Community Center in Killeen, Tex., home of Fort Hood. ''It is our first duty to honor what they have done, and that should not be hard, because it is one of the greatest stories of human history.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Gore, the deeply personal speech today fit into a broader effort by his campaign to reintroduce him to voters through television commercials, speeches and other events that highlight his biography. Later this week he is to promote cancer programs by discussing the death of his sister, Nancy, of lung cancer.</p>
        <p>Nestled in a valley of rolling hills and shuttered steel mills, Elizabeth provided an ideal locale for today's speech by the vice president. The region has large numbers of not only war veterans but also union members and conservative Democrats whose support is seen as vital to his chances of winning Pennsylvania's 23 electoral votes.</p>
        <p>Although he opposed the war in Vietnam, Mr. Gore enlisted in the Army just two months after graduating from Harvard in 1969. Friends have said he signed up in part to protect his father, Senator Albert Gore, an antiwar Democrat who was running for re-election, from criticism by Republicans who supported the war effort. That was a factor to which one longtime associate of the vice president referred in the ceremonies today.</p>
        <p>But in his own talk here, Mr. Gore offered another reason for enlisting, suggesting that he could not have faced the guilt in knowing that some other young man from his Tennessee town had gone in his place, and perhaps been killed.</p>
        <p>''When I went to Vietnam, I had many misgivings,'' he said. ''But my draft board was in Carthage, Tenn., and that made a big difference because, you know, if you found some way not to go, you would know the person who went in your place. That person would have a place and a name and a family and a face.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore described feeling disillusioned upon returning to a nation that was ambivalent, and sometimes hostile, toward Vietnam veterans. That disillusionment, he said, kept him from running for public office for several years.</p>
        <p>''Do you remember that parade that was waiting for us?'' he said of his homecoming. ''One of the reasons Vietnam veterans always say welcome home to one another was of course there wasn't a parade.''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Bush, who spent much of the last month trying to bolster his foreign-policy credentials with proposals related to national defense and remarks on international affairs, he made only the slightest detour in that direction today, calling anew for the development of a vast national defense against ballistic missiles. Both Mr. Gore and Defense Secretary William S. Cohen have recently questioned the prudence of his call for a system much larger than the limited defense the Clinton administration has proposed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush reiterated his own position in a context of a general plea for strengthening the country's armed forces.</p>
        <p>''Those who man the lighthouse of freedom ask little of our nation in return,'' he said. ''But what they ask, our nation must provide: a military of high morale, a military that's well paid and well housed, a military well prepared and well equipped, a military respected by those in authority, a military that's got a coherent vision of America's duties -- a clear military mission in a time of crisis -- and a modern defense system aimed to protect our homeland and to protect our allies.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mr. Gore said his time living in a trailer park with his wife, Tipper, while he was in training in Alabama had taught him about the need to improve the pay, benefits and housing of active-duty military personnel. And both men said that while it was important to pay tribute to war service with monuments and medals, it was even more important to share with young Americans the details of sacrifice.</p>
        <p>''We must pass stories of American courage and character to the next generation, to capture their imaginations, to raise a monument in their hearts,'' Mr. Bush said. ''This is the way our democracy renews its promise: by celebrating American heroes and American values without hesitation and without apology.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Gore, quoting President John F. Kennedy, said, ''Democracy is a call to untiring effort, to continual sacrifice and to the willingness if necessary to die in its defense.''</p>
