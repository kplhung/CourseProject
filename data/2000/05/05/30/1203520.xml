        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton chose to spend Memorial Day walking in a parade in her adopted hometown today and offering an attack, though indirectly,  on her soon-to-be-nominated Republican opponent for the United States Senate over his opposition to handgun registration.</p>
        <p>On a day when Memorial Day parades throughout the state attracted political candidates of every stripe,  Mrs. Clinton said she selected the relatively modest parade in the town where she moved five months ago because it reminded her of commemorations in the Chicago suburb where she was raised.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee for Senate, did not mention her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, by name. But she indirectly criticized the congressman's opposition to handgun registration by re-emphasizing her own position.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to reiterate my call for the licensing and registration of handguns,'' Mrs. Clinton said, speaking to reporters after a Memorial Day ceremony in front of the Chappaqua railroad station. ''I just think we ought to do everything we possibly can to keep them away from people who are criminally inclined.''</p>
        <p>She said several people at the program had told her of their horror concerning the recent killing of five employees at a Wendy's restaurant in Queens.</p>
        <p>''I want to stress what a lot of my neighbors and a lot of people in the community are saying to me, 'We have to do more, not only to be tough on criminals, but we have to be tough on the weapons that criminals use,' '' she said.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Lazio's campaign, Bryan Flood, declined to respond directly to Mrs. Clinton's comments, but he reiterated that Mr. Lazio favors many forms of gun control but not registration.</p>
        <p>''Congressman Lazio has long supported common-sense gun control, often breaking with his own party,'' Mr. Flood said by telephone from Buffalo. For example, he said, Mr. Lazio supported the Brady Bill and the ban on assault weapons.</p>
        <p>''But he believes that before we take the dramatic step of registration, we ought to look at insuring that existing common-sense gun laws are enforced, and this administration's record on enforcing those gun laws is poor,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the days since Mr. Lazio emerged as the Republican candidate, Mrs. Clinton's aides have been preparing to emphasize his opposition to some forms of gun control and to public financing of abortions for the poor. Both are issues that her campaign aides suggest could help her standing among female voters.</p>
        <p>The first lady was received enthusiastically on her first Memorial Day as a Chappaqua resident. Many along the quarter-mile parade route along Kind Street cheered as she walked by, amid a small contingent of Girl Scouts. (Mrs. Clinton is the organization's national honorary chairwoman.)</p>
        <p>She did not speak at the ceremony after the parade, but she lingered long after it had ended, shaking hands and posing for photographs when people asked.</p>
        <p>''I marched in parades with the Girl Scouts probably every Memorial Day ever since I was in first or second grade, all through high school, in a town that was about the size of Chappaqua,'' Mrs. Clinton said, referring to her hometown of Park Ridge, Ill. ''I loved being here and meeting a lot of my neighbors and seeing a lot of the kids. It was a great day and it was pretty nostalgic.''</p>
