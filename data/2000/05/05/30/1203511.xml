        <p>Worldcom Deal May Be End Of Sprint Brand and Service  As Worldcom continues to negotiate for the Justice Department's approval for its pending $115 billion acquisition of Sprint, people close to the talks said in recent days that the discussions could lead to the sale of the Sprint brand and its long-distance service.</p>
        <p>Components of the deal, particularly in the long-distance telephone business, may violate antitrust laws. But it is unlikely that those concerns will derail the entire transaction. Instead, Washington is expected to require that parts of Sprint be sold to outside companies as a condition of approval. [Page C6.]</p>
        <p>Japanese Toy Maker's Baby Bonus  At Bandai, a major Japanese toy maker, the talk these days revolves around one topic -- an announcement that the company will pay employees one million yen, or $10,000, for every baby they have after their second child. Bandai is offering the largest baby bounty in Japan, which is struggling to reverse record-low birthrates that pose many long-term problems. [A1.]</p>
        <p>Hyundai Fails to Finalize Rescue Plan  South Korea's largest conglomerate, the Hyundai Group, and its creditor banks failed to reach an agreement on Hyundai's revamping plans, its main creditor, the Korea Exchange Bank, said. Hyundai and its creditor banks met to develop plans, including a self-rescue plan for a troubled construction unit, which is led by Chung Mong-hun. [C14.]</p>
        <p>European Trade Dispute Escalates  Despite the Clinton administration's hope for a quick resolution to a multibillion-dollar dispute with the European Union over corporate tax policy, the problem appeared to be escalating on the eve of President Clinton's meeting with European leaders in Lisbon. Stuart E. Eizenstat, the deputy treasury secretary, said he was saddened and disappointed by a rebuff on Friday by Pascal Lamy, the European Union's trade commissioner. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Retailers Compete for Top Talent  Finding first-rate talent in the retail industry is notoriously difficult, in part because the best and the brightest are not drawn to a business that often makes executive prospects do time as stock boys. J. C. Penney, Sears and Kmart, which are looking for chief executives at the same time, expect their competitors' searches to increase the difficulty. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Ireland May Seek Tobacco Damages  With bipartisan political support and a growing national awareness of public health issues, the Irish government is taking aggressive steps that could result in Ireland being the first European country to seek damages from tobacco companies for the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses.

        <p>U.S. Markets Reopen  Financial markets in the United States are open today; they were closed yesterday in observance of Memorial Day.</p>
