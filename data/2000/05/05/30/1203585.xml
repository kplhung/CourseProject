        <p>FURST-Sidney S. We of the Psychoanalytic Research and Development Fund sadly record the death of Dr. Sidney S. Furst, our Professional Director for 40 years. Dr. Furst was our friend, companion and colleague, and a dedicated resourceful worker for the Fund. His vigorous efforts on the Fund's behalf were responsible for its many successes and its recognition within the profession. He oversaw its operations and participated actively in its scientific projects. He taught, inspired, wrote and published, all the while conducting a distinguished practice. His affability and intelligence colored all of the Fund's activities. We are grateful for his participation in our endeavors. We share his loss with his family. Mortimer Ostow, President Peter B. Neubauer Henry Nunberg Bernard L. Pacella Vice Presidents</p>
        <p>FURST-Sidney S. Miriam Furst Ostow and Mortimer Ostow mourn their loved brother and brother-in-law, Sidney, who died on May 26. We join his wife and children in sorrow. Shiva at 5021 Iselin Avenue, Riverdale, through Thursday evening.</p>
