        <p>Editorial says bankruptcy legislation being put together by Congressional Republicans contains few constructive ideas and is gift to credit card industry which has gained leverage in Congress through millions of dollars in campaign contributions (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Congressional Republicans had a decent impulse in seeking to tighten bankruptcy laws because filings were soaring and cheats were seeking bankruptcy to evade creditors. But the kernel of good purpose has now mushroomed into House and Senate bills stuffed with gifts to the credit card industry, which has gained leverage in Congress through millions of dollars in campaign contributions.</p>
        <p>The Republicans are now putting together a proposal that would combine elements from each bill. It would impose a rigid means test for determining which petitioners could afford to repay creditors, thereby stripping judges of discretion to weigh individual cases. The goal is to force more petitioners to file under Chapter 13, which could require them to repay creditors at least $170 a month for up to five years. Fewer petitioners would be allowed to file under Chapter 7, which wipes away most debts.</p>

        <p>Congressional Republicans had a decent impulse in seeking to tighten bankruptcy laws because filings were soaring and cheats were seeking bankruptcy to evade creditors. But the kernel of good purpose has now mushroomed into House and Senate bills stuffed with gifts to the credit card industry, which has gained leverage in Congress through millions of dollars in campaign contributions.</p>
        <p>The Republicans are now putting together a proposal that would combine elements from each bill. It would impose a rigid means test for determining which petitioners could afford to repay creditors, thereby stripping judges of discretion to weigh individual cases. The goal is to force more petitioners to file under Chapter 13, which could require them to repay creditors at least $170 a month for up to five years. Fewer petitioners would be allowed to file under Chapter 7, which wipes away most debts.</p>
        <p>The proposal contains a few constructive ideas. It would partially override laws in states that allow debtors to hold on to their homes no matter how much they are worth, though the Republicans threaten to build in loopholes. It would also put a million-dollar cap on individual retirement accounts that debtors could keep out of the reach of creditors.</p>
        <p>But the overwhelming impact would be to hurt unsophisticated debtors and go easy on the well-heeled. The proposal fails to override state laws that allow debtors to lock away millions in trust, a huge benefit to the wealthy. Yet it would make debtors repay more of their credit card debt after they emerge from bankruptcy, forcing those on modest incomes to put repayment to credit card companies in competition with paying for child care. The provisions on repaying loans would force many more people to lose vehicles needed for work.</p>
        <p>The proposal would also make bankruptcy procedures needlessly expensive and complicated. Yet it would do little to rein in credit card companies -- not even forcing them to disclose on the monthly statement how long the cardholders would need to repay loans if they paid only the minimum due.</p>
        <p>Drastic measures might be justified if cheating were rampant. It is not. A prominent study estimated that less than 4 percent of petitioners can afford to pay creditors. So far, Senators Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Patrick Leahy of Vermont, both Democrats, have scuttled Republican efforts to attach the proposal onto unrelated legislation where critics would get little opportunity to amend its punitive provisions. They have received only timid support from the White House. If President Clinton displayed some anger, perhaps he could sidetrack the worst features before they wind up on his desk.</p>
