        <p>In the war on cancer, researchers seem to have reached a plateau in the benefits from chemotherapy, the drug combinations that kill cancerous cells as well as normal ones. So cancer researchers have been exploring original approaches.</p>
        <p>A new hope is to tap into insights about the machinery of cancer cells that scientists have gained in the laboratory in recent years and to convert this knowledge into novel therapies. It is a type of research known as molecular targeting, and it is in its earliest phases of testing on humans.</p>
        <p>Molecular targeting gets its name from the use of experimental drugs that strike selectively at specific areas in cancerous cells to disrupt their functions.</p>
        <p>Other drugs, known as angiogenesis inhibitors, are used to thwart the growth of new blood vessels and to starve malignant cells from their supply of oxygen and nourishment. These drugs have achieved striking results in reversing cancer in mice and have raised hopes that they will be effective in humans.</p>
        <p>In initial testing on humans, many new experimental therapies produce unexpected findings, and those reported at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology here last week were no exception.</p>
        <p>The surprises included some benefits where none were expected, validating the concept. But there were also some lethal effects, raising concerns about their safety.</p>
        <p>Despite the mixed reviews, researchers said they saw enough potential to push on.</p>
        <p>Novel therapies are usually first tested on the sickest patients, those with most to gain and least to lose. Under the Food and Drug Administration's three-stage testing system, the first phase focuses on the safety of experimental drugs. Randomized controlled trials, regarded as the scientific gold standard because they compare new therapies with standard ones or placebos, usually come later.</p>
        <p>Thus, tests on more humans will be needed before the F.D.A. will license any of the experimental therapies. Meanwhile, the doctors conducting the trials and the manufacturers of the experimental drugs have eagerly promoted the early findings, in part to solicit new patients and strengthen their stock prices.</p>
        <p>Among those that the oncology society highlighted are these:</p>
        <p>*A monoclonal antibody that ImClone Systems has developed as C225 has shown promise in testing among people with advanced cancers of the colon, head and neck. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that are engineered to detect and bind to other proteins that are present on cancer cells and that aim at thwarting a cancer's ability to grow. All 15 patients with advanced head and neck cancers who received a combination of radiation and of C225 had full or significant shrinkage of their tumors, Dr. James A. Bonner of the University of Alabama reported.</p>
        <p>The participants were followed for more than two and a half years. Six have died, and the other nine are alive, apparently free of disease. The shrinkage has lasted for 27 or more months in four patients. Normally, fewer than half survive after one and a half years, Dr. Bonner said.</p>
        <p>*AstraZeneca's drug known as ZD1839 is designed to block a protein, epidermal growth factor. The drug unexpectedly shrank tumors and prolonged survival in a first stage study, where efficacy is rarely shown, said Dr. David Ferry of the Institute for Cancer Studies in Birmingham, England. The study included patients from two hospitals in the United States.</p>
        <p>*Genentech's Rhumab is a monoclonal antibody and anti-angiogenesis drug designed to block a growth factor in blood vessels. In a randomized controlled trial involving 99 patients at Vanderbilt University, the lung cancer spread after 7.4 months  in a group receiving Rhumab and standard chemotherapy, compared with 4.2 months among those who received chemotherapy only, Dr. Russell DeVore reported. But, unexpectedly, six patients taking Rhumab suddenly began coughing up blood and four of them died, Dr. DeVore said. Because the four deaths occurred in patients with the squamous cell form of lung cancer, researchers are trying to determine whether something about this type of tumor would preclude use of Rhumab for such patients.</p>
        <p>*In a study involving 28 patients, intravenous injections of Sugen's drug, SU5416, combined with standard chemotherapy stopped advanced colon cancer growth for a median of nine months, compared with six months for standard therapy alone, said Dr. Lee Rosen of the University of California at Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>*Removing a cancerous kidney and delivering an immune therapy known as interferon alfa 2b increased survival to an average of 12 months compared with immune therapy alone in a study begun in 1991 and conducted in several hospitals, said its leader, Dr. Robert Flanigan of Loyola University in Maywood, Ill. Although the improvement in survival was relatively small, longer benefits may come from trials involving newer immune drugs and surgery in advanced kidney cancer, Dr. Flanigan said.</p>
        <p>Until major new therapies and preventions knock cancer out as the second leading cause of death among Americans, after heart disease, doctors will often have to deliver bad news to such patients. Dr. Robert Lenzi of the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston conducted a survey of his colleagues at a society meeting in 1998. More than 90 percent of the 500 oncologists surveyed said they had no formal training in  breaking bad news and managing related emotional reactions.</p>
        <p>Top challenges were being honest without destroying hope and effectively communicating with crying or angry patients. About one-quarter of those surveyed had a consistent strategy for breaking bad news.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lenzi said there were signs that medical schools and teaching hospitals that train residents were beginning to use methods known to be effective, like role playing, group discussion, videotaping and feedback in training programs.</p>
