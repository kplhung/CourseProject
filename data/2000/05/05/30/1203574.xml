        <p>THE COACHES -- Larry Robinson of the Devils, who speaks with brevity and bluntness, won six championship rings as a top defenseman; Ken Hitchcock of the Stars, a more garrulous man, never played in the National Hockey League. Hitchcock coached his team to the championship last year; Robinson never won a single playoff round until this spring. Both will be challenged with personnel adjustments under pressure and personality management under stress.</p>
        <p>THE GOALIES -- Ed Belfour of the Stars and Martin Brodeur of the Devils have nearly identical statistics in this year's playoffs. Belfour is 12-5 with a 1.81 goals against average and a .931 save percentage. Brodeur is 12-5 with a 1.77 goals against and a .923 save percentage. All this merely means they play for good teams. In the last round, Brodeur slumped for three games, then regained his equilibrium. Belfour has yet to skid in this way, but he is known for his temper. With creases more crowded this season due to rule changes, a loss of poise by a goalie can change a game and a series.</p>

        <p>THE CAPTAINS -- Each side has a leader from the same mold. Scott Stevens of the Devils and Derian Hatcher of the Stars are both big defensemen and heavy hitters who don't pile up too many offensive statistics. Both have led their teams to championships: Hatcher last year and Stevens in 1995.</p>
        <p>THE SNIPERS -- Against Philadelphia, the Devils' line of Jason Arnott, Petr Sykora and Patrik Elias sparked the team with 17 points and two dozen good scoring chances. But neither they nor any of their fellow forwards can match Dallas's dynamic duo of Mike Modano and Brett Hull. Hull has 20 points this spring and Modano has 19. They are tough, crafty veterans who thrive under pressure.</p>
        <p>THE ENVIRONMENT -- Up to three games will be played in Dallas, where temperatures in June often stay in the 90's with high humidity. The ice at Reunion Arena gets mushy and the Devils are not accustomed to playing on it, especially at this time of year. The Stars are.</p>
