        <p>Invasion of the Ants</p>
        <p>In Stanislaw Lem's 1961 science fiction classic ''Solaris,'' a group of scientists encounters a world covered by a sentient ocean, a single, giant organism that invades every nook and cranny of the planet (and, unfortunately for the scientists, every nook and cranny of their minds).</p>
        <p>Nothing quite that creepy is going on in California, but the state has been overrun by a species of ant that, researchers say, has essentially formed a single giant colony from San Diego to San Francisco and beyond. The researchers, from the University of California at San Diego, discovered a lack of genetic variation in the insect, the Argentine ant, which has allowed the species to spread to nooks and crannies up and down the state, particularly in coastal areas.</p>
        <p>Individual ants are so close genetically, the researchers report in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, that they consider all their fellows to be close relatives and thus do not engage in the kind of fierce intercolony death matches that limit the ants in their native Argentina.</p>
        <p>A lack of genetic diversity is normally considered bad for a population, making it vulnerable to disease, among other problems. The ants are unusual: their lack of variation is beneficial, allowing them to thrive.</p>
        <p>The sameness results from the insects' having gone through a genetic bottleneck -- all of them having descended from a relatively small group. That makes sense given the ants' history. They are believed to have entered the United States aboard ships that were carrying coffee and sugar from Argentina in the 1890's.</p>
        <p>Patterns in the Forest</p>
        <p>Creamy or chunky? That's a thorny issue among children, and also among ecologists who study the distribution of trees in tropical forests. Are forests creamy, with trees of the same species dispersed randomly, or chunky, with the trees clumped together? As with peanut butter, each side has strong opinions on the matter.</p>
        <p>A new report in Science appears to have settled the question. Researchers from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and other institutions surveyed six forest plots of 60 to 130 acres in Asia and Central America, noting the location of all trees. They found that almost all the species, numbering more than 1,700, grew in clumps.</p>
        <p>The researchers found that the results were the same both for smaller trees and for those with trunks larger than four inches in diameter. And at all but one site, rare species were substantially more clumped than common ones. The highest degree of clumping was found among crape myrtles in a Thai forest, where 51 of 59 specimens grew within about 20 yards of one another.</p>
        <p>The work should help conservationists develop forest reserves and determine harvest patterns that will sustain, not destroy, a forest.</p>
        <p>Where to Point the Hubble</p>
        <p>The Hubble Space Telescope needs some help getting pointed in the right direction. It's not that its gyroscopes are shot -- they were just replaced, after all, by a shuttle maintenance crew. No, the Hubble just needs to be told what to look at, and the public is invited to make suggestions.</p>
        <p>The Hubble Heritage Project, an educational group at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, is conducting an online vote to help select the next object to be observed. Visitors to the project site (heritage.stsci.edu) can make suggestions until June 6, with the final decision being made by the heritage team. The observation will be made in August.</p>
        <p>The site has guidelines for the kinds of objects that can be suggested (nothing in the solar system is acceptable for this project, because of the complexities involved in training the Hubble on a close moving object), as well as a link to astronomy education resources for those who do not know the Milky Way from a Mars bar. Votes to focus the instrument on your neighbor's house will not be counted.</p>
