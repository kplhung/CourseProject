But Torre's comments about wanting to remain with the Yankees for a while seemed to open up the possibility that Torre would consider signing an extension.</p>
        <p>''When I say a while, I mean this year and next year,'' Torre said. ''I don't know about beyond that. I'll keep doing this as long as it remains fun,  and it's fun right now.''</p>
        <p>Torre, who makes $3 million a year, has not talked to George Steinbrenner about his future because he will not make a decision until he sees how the 2001 season unfolds.</p>
