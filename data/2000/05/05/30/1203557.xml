        <p>THIS is the sort of afternoon that made Larry Bird want to retire now. Go fishing now. A day after he challenged his team to disregard the X's and O's and just show up and play, the Pacer team that came here with so much momentum dropped a second straight game to the Knicks.</p>
        <p>If the Pacers should lose this series -- and they really deserve to lose it after yesterday's performance -- Game 4 will be circled in red in the Pacers' scrapbook.</p>
        <p>The Knicks had no wheels and Indiana -- a team from the city of speed, a team founded on the premise that it would ''set the pace'' in pro basketball -- was effectively lapped. The Pacers were lapped by a team whose best player has a broken bone in his foot, whose most versatile player has a sprained knee, whose small forward has a stiff back and whose center didn't even suit up.</p>
        <p>Bird, who has said this season is his last as coach, blamed the Pacers' lack of defense for the loss. ''It was all defense,'' Bird said. ''They were hitting shots and they were just ripping us apart.''</p>
        <p>With all due respect to Larry Legend, it ain't ''D.'' It's ''O.'' Slow offense is killing the Pacers and pushing them very close to another dismal ending.</p>
        <p>Bird should go back at look at tapes of the last few weeks of the Knicks' regular season last year; he'll see a team and a coach very much a mirror image of these Pacers. A slow, thuddish team, with Knick Coach Jeff Van Gundy insisting on using Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby off the bench. Yes, in retrospect it seems like going across the ocean with a twin-engine prop, but that's the way it was. Plod, plod, throw the ball in to Patrick Ewing.</p>
        <p>The Pacers, with the same predictable lineup, the same predictable plays, are pushing the ball up with 35-year-old Mark Jackson at point guard, and sending it in to the lumbering 33-year-old Rik Smits.</p>
        <p>''We're not exactly a speed-demon team,'' said Travis Best, the guard who who backs up Jackson.</p>
        <p>Asked if he could go into a room and throw a faster lineup together using players on this Pacer team, Best said he could.</p>
        <p>But then someone would have to be out of the starting lineup. ''That will never happen,'' Best said.</p>
        <p>Jalen Rose was asked the same question. Yes, he said, there are players on the team who can run. He refused to mention names.</p>
        <p>''Let me say it this way,'' he said. ''We run a lot of set plays. This time of year in the playoffs, teams know your plays. They defend them. You have to do something different.''</p>
        <p>Rose pointed out that the Pacers have had practically the same lineup for the last couple of seasons. No change, no variation. The Knicks were fortunate in an unfortunate way last year when Ewing was injured and that injury opened the floor for Sprewell, Camby, Larry Johnson and Allan Houston. Now, even the usually conservative Charlie Ward is playing more aggressively, pushing the ball up, using his athleticism much more freely at both ends of the court to make the Knicks a faster, more diverse team.</p>
        <p>If Bird glances over at the Knicks' bench, he'll notice that as soon as the the Knicks grab a rebound, Van Gundy is jumping out of his skin, waving his arms and telling his team to push it, push it, hurry up and attack. Is Bird watching?</p>
        <p>''We're playing too slow,'' Rose said. ''We have to find a way to get easy baskets. They have a great halfcourt defense; we have to force the tempo.''</p>
        <p>Jackson started and played 24 minutes. Maybe that's too many. Best came off the bench and played 24 as well. Maybe that's too few. Young Austin Croshere played only 17 minutes. Young, versatile Jonathan Bender, the Pacers' Camby-to-be, didn't play at all.</p>
        <p>The Knicks celebrated a stolen victory at home yesterday and tied the series, and if Bird and the Pacers don't adjust, the Knicks will be celebrating a stolen game at Conseco in Game 5 or Game 7. The Pacers need a facelift.</p>
        <p>If you're a Knicks fan, you're praying mightily for the Pacers to keep fielding the same lineup and taking the same approach. Indiana is praying for Ewing to get well and be inserted back into the lineup. The new face of the Pacers must be Rose, with Best and Croshere and even Bender if he's healthy and ready. For 13 seasons the Pacers' face has been Reggie Miller. He will go down as one of the deadliest outside shooters in league history, but Miller, 34, hasn't carried his team to a championship, or even to a final series, and his jump shooting won't carry this Pacer team, either.</p>
        <p>Bird, somewhat like Magic Johnson during his brief, frustrating stint as the Lakers' coach, sees himself in these games and sees his era, and he can't understand why this team just won't listen and do it his way. He has told the Pacers that if they listen to him, they will win a championship.</p>
        <p>Maybe it's time that Bird listens, or reads between the lines of his players. The Pacers need a new face for the long run, and a new scheme for the short run. In any event, they need to run. And Larry Legend needs to listen.</p>
