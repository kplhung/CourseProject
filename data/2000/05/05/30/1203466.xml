        <p>The holiday weekend, spurred by a spectacular opening for Tom Cruise's ''M:I-2''; a solid debut for Jackie Chan's comic western, ''Shanghai Noon''; and strong holdover business for May hits like ''Dinosaur,'' ''Gladiator'' and ''Road Trip,'' has seen a Memorial Day record of $174.7 million in ticket sales for the top 12 films.</p>
        <p>''That's huge; it's amazing,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor Relations, a Los Angeles company that monitors box-office performance.

        <p>The holiday weekend, spurred by a spectacular opening for Tom Cruise's ''M:I-2''; a solid debut for Jackie Chan's comic western, ''Shanghai Noon''; and strong holdover business for May hits like ''Dinosaur,'' ''Gladiator'' and ''Road Trip,'' has seen a Memorial Day record of $174.7 million in ticket sales for the top 12 films.</p>
        <p>''That's huge; it's amazing,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor Relations, a Los Angeles company that monitors box-office performance. ''Typically, Memorial Day is totally dominated by one film, but this shows a real depth at the box office that you don't normally see.''</p>
        <p>It also smashes the record of $148 million -- for the top 50 films -- set over the four-day Memorial Day weekend in 1997, when ''The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' opened with $90.2 million. Exhibitor Relations charts only the performance of the top 12 films in its initial estimates, released today, but when the numbers are compiled for the top 50 in coming days, Mr. Dergarabedian said, the 2000 Memorial Day cumulative box office could well rise above $190 million.</p>
        <p>''It is amazing how big the smiles are around our business this weekend,'' said Chuck Viane, president for distribution at Disney. ''It really sets everybody up for the summer.''</p>
        <p>The movie landscape may be shifting, as many here believe, with audiences demanding offbeat stories, studios pushing for lower costs, and rapidly changing technologies constantly rattling the firmament. But when the weather gets hot and schools begin to let out, audiences apparently want what they have always craved: big stars doing big stunts in big movies and, of course, dinosaurs.</p>
        <p>''During the course of the year we will seek out movies that are a little bit different, but when it comes to the holidays, when you want to be with your family, you look for star-driven vehicles or technological vehicles or comedies or something that you are sure is going to work,'' Mr. Viane said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cruise's film, whose title stands for ''Mission: Impossible-2,'' earned an estimated $71.8 million in 3,653 theaters over the four-day weekend, making it the second-biggest opening ever, after the ''Jurassic Park'' sequel, stronger even than last year's holiday weekend showing for the heavily hyped ''Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace.'' The original ''Mission: Impossible'' film, released on Memorial Day weekend in 1996, earned $56.8 million in its four-day opening.</p>
        <p>''Clearly this record was spurred by the success of 'Mission: Impossible 2,' '' said Robert G. Friedman, vice chairman of the Paramount Motion Picture Group, which is distributing the film. ''What's amazing is that the good will left over from the first film combined with the enormous popularity of Tom Cruise and the adoration toward director John Woo from some in the movie audience came together to create this tremendous opening.''</p>
        <p>Not long ago, after the disappointing box office performance of Mr. Cruise's previous two films -- Stanley Kubrick's ''Eyes Wide Shut'' and Paul Thomas Anderson's ''Magnolia'' -- there was some speculation in Hollywood that the actor's star might be dimming. All that will be forgotten now.</p>
        <p>''M:I-2'' should pass the $100 million mark on Tuesday or Wednesday; it has already earned $92.8 million since its opening on Wednesday. Early estimates are that it will be the first of what may be several $200 million movies this summer. Last summer a record number of films earned more than $100 million and, based on the early box office strength shown this year, studio executives are predicting a repeat.</p>
        <p>''Look at what's out there already,'' Mr. Viane said. ''It will be hard for me not to believe there will be a dozen, if not more, $100 million movies this summer.''</p>
        <p>Coming potential blockbusters include Nicolas Cage in ''Gone in 60 Seconds,'' an auto-theft thriller; Mel Gibson in ''The Patriot,'' a Revolutionary War epic; and George Clooney in ''The Perfect Storm,'' an adaptation of the nonfiction best seller about fishermen fighting a raging storm in the North Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Disney's computer-animated ''Dinosaur'' finished in second place over the weekend, earning $33.5 million for a cumulative total of $81.9 million since its May 19 opening. The newcomer ''Shanghai Noon,'' another Disney film, finished third with $19.5 million.</p>
        <p>DreamWorks' ''Gladiator'' was fourth with $17.3 million and a cumulative total of $127.2 million since its May 5 opening. ''Road Trip,'' another DreamWorks film, was in fifth place with $14 million and a cumulative total of $35.8 since its May 12 debut.</p>
        <p>The box office estimates are for the four-day holiday weekend, meaning that it includes actual ticket sales from theaters on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, plus each studio's estimates of ticket sales for today. Adjusted final figures, including actual ticket sales today, will be released on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Not all the news for studios was good, though. ''The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas'' did not click with family audiences in May and has already dipped to 11th place at the box office, while John Travolta's ''Battlefield Earth'' has tumbled out of the top 12 after only 18 days of release.</p>
        <p>''This weekend's box office sort of flies in the face of what everybody thought was a sea change in terms of summer blockbusters, especially in light of 'The Blair Witch Project' and 'The Sixth Sense' last summer,'' Mr. Dergarabedian said. ''Typically, popcorn movies are what rules the summer and that hasn't changed. This is just what people want in the summer.''</p>
