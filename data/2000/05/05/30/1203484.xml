        <p>Borrowing a page from OPEC's strategy book, the world's leading coffee producers have agreed to withhold beans from the market to raise the price from seven-year lows.</p>
        <p>But since they reached that agreement a little more than a week ago, cracks in the unity of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries and its allies have already appeared.</p>
        <p>The price of coffee, which rose in the days immediately after the agreement, has since relinquished some of that gain. On the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, coffee for July delivery  reached nearly $1.04 a pound after the agreement, but by last Friday it had retreated to $99.2 cents a pound.</p>
        <p>Meeting in London on May 19, the 14-member association, working with five nonmember coffee producers, said they were prepared to withhold 20 percent of coffee crops from the market. The producers, which make up about 85 percent of the world's coffee production, said they would come up with a more detailed plan by June 16 when they return to London for another meeting.</p>
        <p>Commodities analysts have grown increasingly skeptical, however. They point to the lack of specifics about how such a plan would work, in the face of an increasing world supply of coffee beans.</p>
        <p>''The market is in a vacuum,'' said  Arthur Stevenson, a commodities analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. ''Only once we find out how the governments involved intend to effectuate those plans and how they intend to finance them will we know whether this whole thing has any real legitimacy and credibility.''</p>
        <p>Doubts about the success of such an agreement started appearing even before the meeting began, when some of the major world coffee producers, including the leading robusta bean producer, Indonesia, said that they lacked the resources to pay coffee growers to withhold supply.</p>
        <p>''I think that one of the challenges in such a plan is putting in the financial or economic mechanisms to be able to fund those within the coffee sectors that would be receiving money to retain their crop,'' said Robert Nelson, president and chief executive officer of the National Coffee Association of the United States. ''That is going to be of primary concern to the farmers.''</p>
        <p>Mexico, one of the coffee producing association's nonmember observers, along with Vietnam, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua, has said that it planned to offset the lost exports by stimulating domestic consumption of coffee. But stimulating consumption is a long-term process that is unlikely to absorb the excess supply of coffee. Brazil, which is the world's leading producer and exporter of coffee beans, will be the pivotal player in the success of the plan to withhold coffee beans. At the moment, Brazil seems committed to seeing that the plan is successful.</p>
        <p>''The government wouldn't being doing all of this if it didn't want the plan to work,'' said David Nahum Neto, the general secretary of the Association of the Coffee Industry of Brazil.</p>
        <p>Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes, the agriculture minister of Brazil, said after the meeting in London that the country had already allocated $167 million to financing the retention of about 3 million 60-kilogram bags of coffee from Brazil's total crop for 1999-2000 of about 27 million bags.</p>
        <p>But Brazil's coffee industry, which is expected to expand sharply in the coming years, is taking an increasingly larger share of the world market. That is something that experts say the country will be unlikely to jeopardize by restricting supply over the long term.</p>
        <p>Theoretically, at least, withholding coffee is akin to the strategy of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to curtail the production of oil. OPEC has been successful the last few years in restricting how much each member produces, a strategy that has raised the price of oil.</p>
        <p>But that may be where the comparison with coffee ends. Coffee, unlike oil, is not critical to the smooth functioning of the world economy, so producers have less influence over the market. To make matters worse for the coffee exporting countries, history does not provide any examples of successful agreements to keep beans off the market.</p>
        <p>''In the past, these types of agreements have proven ineffective and unenforceable,'' said Mr. Nelson of the National Coffee Association of the United States.</p>
        <p>Until the June meeting of the coffee producing nations, analysts say, coffee prices will remain vulnerable to speculation about an eventual agreement. Traders will also be keeping a close eye on Brazil, where the onset of winter in June could affect the coffee crop. A damaging frost in the coffee belt of Brazil could make a price agreement unnecessary.</p>
