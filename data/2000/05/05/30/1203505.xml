        <p>In New York City's restaurant firmament, where establishments ceaselessly open and close, where fortunes are made and lost overnight, and where chefs can go as hot and as cold as the soup, there are few unchanging truths.</p>
        <p>But one reality has dominated the city's enormous inventory of distinguished restaurants: a scarcity of black waiters.</p>
        <p>''For anyone who eats in high-end restaurants in Manhattan, it is impossible to ignore the fact that there is very little, if any, diversity in many, many restaurants,'' said Andrew G. Celli Jr., the bureau chief for civil rights in the New York State attorney general's office. ''It's really in your face.''</p>
        <p>While more than 26 percent of New York City's population is black, only 10.5 percent of its 48,176 waiters and waitresses are black, according to 1996 census data. Since many of those are working in low-end neighborhood restaurants, the racial disparity among waiters in mid-to-high-priced places is greater.</p>
        <p>For many city restaurantgoers, though, that truth takes awhile to sink in.</p>
        <p>''People are so used to the exclusion of African-Americans, you don't even notice,'' said David A. Paterson, a black state senator whose district includes Harlem and part of Washington Heights.</p>
        <p>The reasons for the disparity are as complicated as diners' orders. Interviews with dozens of restaurant owners and waiters, and with state, city and labor leaders reveal an industry that acknowledges a dearth of black waiters, but offers several reasons for their absence.</p>
        <p>At many Chinese, Japanese, Italian and other ethnic restaurants, for instance, owners say that they employ no blacks as waiters because they need to hire employees sharing their own backgrounds. They say that customers demand the authenticity implied by the presence of ethnic waiters in ethnic restaurants.</p>
        <p>Other restaurateurs say few blacks apply for the jobs even though new restaurants are plentiful and waiters are scarce. And both black waiters and leaders acknowledge that black Americans may be rejecting what they perceive as a servile profession.</p>
        <p>But many blacks working in high-end restaurants in New York City say that the real reason their numbers are so small is racism.</p>
        <p>Waiting jobs could have considerable economic significance in black neighborhoods where boom times have certainly not brought full employment. Jobs in the city's 20,000 restaurants have increased 24 percent since 1992 in an industry that generated about $7.2 billion in revenues in 1998. Waiters at top city restaurants can earn from $40,000 to $70,000 a year or more.</p>
        <p>''Restaurant jobs are steppingstones into careers and opportunities for many,'' said Lloyd A. Williams, president of the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce. ''There is absolutely no question that blacks are being discriminated against as waiters and waitresses.''</p>
        <p>Certainly many black waiters perceive this to be true. Chris Harvey, a waiter at Aquagrill in SoHo, said he had been shut out of previous jobs because of his skin color. ''Young whites come and go, but it takes me longer to find a job,'' Mr. Harvey  said. ''So when I find a place, I stay.''</p>
        <p>George Thomas, 35, remembered the days when he was trying to get a toehold in the industry. ''I have faxed restaurants with my qualifications,'' recalled Mr. Thomas, who is black, ''and they expressed excitement. Then they saw me in person, and the whole conversation changed.''</p>
        <p>He kept applying for jobs, refused to take no as an answer, and became a waiter, a maitre d'hotel and sommelier at Gotham Bar and Grill in Greenwich Village. He later became a waiter captain at the three-star restaurant Daniel on East 65th Street, and for the last year, he has been a captain at the four-star Bouley Bakery in TriBeCa.</p>
        <p>But his is the exceptional story. ''In some respects there is a ceiling for black people,'' Mr. Thomas said, adding that in regard to managers, maitres d'hotel and captains, ''there are not many blacks at fine restaurants.''</p>
        <p>One of them, Daniel Smalls, 36, a former waiter, is now a manager at Guastavino's at Bridgemarket, where 40 percent of the waitstaff of 120 is black. ''A lot of black people began to apply here when they saw me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>White waiters predominate at many of New York's better-known restaurants. For example, of the 10 waiters and 5 captains in the dining room of La Cote Basque, the haute cuisine doyenne at 60 West 55th Street, none are black.</p>
        <p>Only one of the eight waiters and three captains at Le Perigord, the 36-year-old French grande dame at 405 East 52nd Street, is dark-skinned -- a server from Bangladesh. Of the 48 waiters in the dining room and banquet operation of the four-star Le Cirque 2000, on Madison Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets, two are black.</p>
        <p>But the owners of Le Perigord, La Cote Basque and Le Cirque 2000 say they do not have racist employment policies. ''The majority of our people working here are minorities,'' said Sirio Maccioni, the owner of Le Cirque 2000, ''including our chef,'' who is Cambodian.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Brooks Bitterman, research director of Local 100 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union, which organizes the city's nonhotel waiters, said the whiteness of waiters was striking considering ''that 99 percent of low-wage kitchen workers are nonwhite minorities, Hispanics and Asians.'' Dr. Bitterman added, ''That contrasts with white senior cooks in many kitchens, and the primarily white front-of-house staffs.''</p>
        <p>While women's groups and the state attorney general's office have challenged sex discrimination at some of New York's elite restaurants, racial discrimination has not really registered on the official radar screen. Mr. Celli of the attorney general's office said, ''We have several open investigations involving several high-end luxury restaurants,'' but these cases focus on sex discrimination. Racial discrimination may be involved, he added, because ''when you look at one thing, you often find other sorts of things.''</p>
        <p>Restaurant discrimination cases have traditionally been difficult to prove, but in 1998, the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission won a prosecution at the Harley-Davidson Cafe in Midtown: an African-American waitress, Lisa McDonald, won $175,000 after complaining that she had been verbally insulted (she accused the manager of saying ''you look like Buckwheat'') and ordered to redo her hair at the restaurant.</p>
        <p>In February 1999, the Times Square Brewery agreed to pay $450,000 to $650,000 to settle a lawsuit involving accusations of discrimination and racial slurs, filed on behalf of 27 employees, but it admitted no wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams, of the Harlem chamber of commerce, suggested that a more representative labor organization might encourage black waiters to enter the restaurant industry. Yet currently only a little more than 10 percent of the city's waiters are represented by the two principal restaurant unions. Leaders of Local 6 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union said the union has little control over whom restaurants hire. The local represents nearly 4,000 New York hotel waiters earning $25,000 to $100,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Some unionized restaurants contend that seniority rules make new job openings for blacks very scarce. ''Our waiters are here for life, and last September we had our first job opening in three or four years,'' said Georges Briguet, owner of Le Perigord, explaining how he had hired the restaurant's Bangladeshi server.</p>
        <p>Individual restaurateurs have made efforts to hire more blacks. Danny Meyer, co-owner of the Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern, Tabla and 11 Madison Park, said that five years ago, he became concerned about the ''sameness'' of his front-of-house staff. ''I asked managers why the staff wasn't more diverse,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''I wasn't satisfied with their answer that 'no minorities applied.' ''</p>
        <p>So Mr. Meyer gave blacks visible jobs as hostesses and maitres d'hotel, blacks noticed and began applying, and ''things have changed dramatically now that we have people of color right at the front door.'' He added that now his staff is more diverse and so is his clientele.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meyer does not insist that his Indian-themed restaurant, Tabla, employ only Indian waiters. Some restaurateurs, though, maintain that they cannot hire black servers because doing so may make ethnic restaurants seem less authentic to customers. ''In the older, high-end French and Italian places -- where the proprietor is of a certain age -- these people want to surround themselves with members of their own culture and their own age,'' said Eric Weiss, whose company, Service Arts Incorporated, has hired the staffs of many high-end restaurants.</p>
        <p>But Peter Ward, president of Local 6 of the hotel and restaurant employees' union, said that ''it is ridiculous to suppose that you need to be Italian to serve Italian food.''</p>
        <p>Some black waiters say they have faced racism from customers, too. Mr. Thomas said he would not soon forget the customer at Gotham Bar and Grill who told him, ''For a colored boy, you're not too bad.'' And Mr. Smalls of Guastavino's, who previously worked his way up to manager at the four-star Jean Georges near Columbus Circle, remembers customers there who kept insisting on speaking to the real boss. ''I'd have to say to them, 'No, the manager -- that's me,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>Some blacks say that another problem is the lack of black chefs in New York City's finest kitchens. Carl Redding Jr., 36, said that he was not able to find a top cooking position in a white-owned restaurant, so he opened his own, Amy Ruth's, which serves up home-style Southern cuisine on West 116th Street in Harlem.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Redding said that racism works both ways: ''there is racism on the part of blacks against whites,'' meaning that several Harlem restaurants hire only black waiters.</p>
        <p>Bedelia Woods of Sylvia's, the soul-food landmark in Harlem, said this is not the case at her restaurant. ''Our doors are open to everybody,'' said Ms. Woods, a daughter of the owner, Sylvia Woods. She added that when white servers answer the restaurant's job advertisements and ask for directions, ''when we say uptown in Harlem, they may not come.''</p>
        <p>Part of the reason for the scarcity of black waiters, some suggest, may be a self-fulfilling prophecy. ''Young African-American women and men don't go out for those jobs,'' State Senator Paterson said. ''They think those jobs are closed off to them.''</p>
        <p>And it may be that the idea of serving people is the hurdle. Perhaps other blacks ''think it's a belittling job,'' Mr. Smalls suggested.</p>
        <p>Can patrons change the status quo? Some black leaders suggest that their buying power can speak volumes. ''We should not eat where we can't work,'' said State Assemblyman Keith L. Wright, who represents Harlem.</p>
        <p>Mr. Celli of the attorney general's office agreed that the diners hold the cards. ''The restaurant industry is driven by consumer likes and dislikes,'' he said. ''If we change the culture so that, as a society, it is no longer attractive to have an all-white, all-male work force, then the customer will have to be right. And there will be change.''</p>
