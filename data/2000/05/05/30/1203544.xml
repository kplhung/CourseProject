        <p>The students have been back in the streets, throwing Molotov cocktails at the presidential palace, and the police have been firing back, with tear gas and water cannon. A journalist was tortured last week after he said he had evidence that the intelligence chief was conspiring with election officials.  The army called for order.</p>
        <p>On the surface it appeared so familiar, as President Alberto K. Fujimori rode to a third term on Sunday in an election so full of dirty tricks that Alejandro Toledo, the opposition candidate, withdrew from the race, and all the international election monitors backed off, too, before a single vote was cast.</p>
        <p>But this battle has a different script. Issues that were important before the end of Communism are not the issues any longer, and the same is true around the region.</p>
        <p>Old issues of land, class conflict and resistance to imperialism that were foremost during the waves of guerrilla insurrections, university revolts and military coups in Peru from the 1960's into the early 1990's  are no longer setting the sparks.</p>
        <p>The new dominant issue facing Peruvians is whether the nation is best served by politicians who put democracy first, or those who put stability first. It is a question that was not resolved Sunday, because the election was effectively not contested.</p>
        <p>''Before, the issue was survival,'' said Francisco Diez Canseco, a former congressman and human rights activist. ''Now it's about whether the virtues of authoritarianism are to be replaced by the growing desire of people for broader political participation.''</p>
        <p>The question crosses class and ideological boundaries. It raises uncomfortable choices for a nation whose few experiments in democracy brought corruption, inefficiency, instability and economic chaos.</p>
        <p>And United States policy makers also find themselves in a quandary, wanting to encourage free elections but also to support a government that has been a strong ally against terrorism and drug trafficking.</p>
        <p>The cast of characters and alliances would have seemed impossible before Communism's collapse, when the political currents flowing across Latin America originated in Washington, Moscow and Havana.</p>
        <p>Take Mr. Toledo, whose resume  and platform would have been unthinkable just a few years ago for someone proposing to annul an election and overthrow a government.</p>
        <p>Though he comes from a poor family, Mr. Toledo is a former World Bank employee and business school professor, and has a doctorate from Stanford. He says his first project, if he ever makes it to the presidential palace, would be to create an independent uncorrupt judiciary. His core constituency is the urban middle class.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Toledo, the choice for Peru now is between ''democracy and dictatorship.''</p>
        <p>In the past, moderates like him usually found themselves facing a choice between the right and the left, and they usually lost out in coalitions with Marxist guerrillas or right wing generals. Today in Peru, the moderates are leading the revolution and the leftists are following.</p>
        <p>Standing between this rather unrevolutionary lot and power is President Fujimori. The son of Japanese immigrants, Mr. Fujimori remains in many ways the ultimate outsider even after 10 years in power. He is still the target of nasty racial jokes by the Lima elites, and he is proud that his core constituency entails the urban shantytown dwellers and Indian villagers in regions most severely attacked by Maoist terrorists in the 1980's and early 1990's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori has a long list of accomplishments, ranging from the defeat of two terrorist groups and hyperinflation to making peace with Ecuador after more than a century of border strife. He has probably built more schools, roads and health clinics to serve the poor than every other Peruvian president combined.</p>
        <p>The problem with Mr. Fujimori, according to his critics, is that he fires judges when they disagree with him, he uses his intelligence agency to harass his opponents, he finds ways to put cronies in charge of television stations, and is willing to convict suspected terrorists without giving their lawyers the benefit of cross-examination. In short, he does not give democratic rules a very high priority.</p>
        <p>In an interview last week, Mr. Fujimori said his muscular tactics may not be pretty but they are necessary. ''In emergency situations,'' he said, ''I had to take emergency measures that may have appeared anti-democratic.'' He promised that once he is inaugurated on July 28, ''there will be certain corrections.''</p>
        <p>In 1992, Mr. Fujimori temporarily disbanded the Congress and Supreme Court, saying he needed more powers to defeat the terrorists and narcotics traffickers. The traditional political parties that controlled those institutions, he argued, only stood in the way. Washington and Latin democracies were highly critical, but the Peruvian people went along enthusiastically, and Mr. Fujimori won a re-election landslide in 1995.</p>
        <p>Opinion polls suggest that the Peruvian president might well have won a clean, uncontested election this year again, although by a much narrower margin. With Peru no longer in crisis, a growing number of voters appeared ready to give democracy a chance again.</p>
        <p>In the end, historians will probably judge Mr. Fujimori on the basis of how he puts Peru in shape for an eventual change to democratic rule.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Toledo and Mr. Fujimori have in common is their blurring of ideological distinctions. What does it mean to be conservative or progressive -- when the two candidates, who otherwise seem to be at war with each other, essentially share economic and social goals?</p>
        <p>It is much the same in Mexico, where some left-leaning activists are backing the conservative presidential candidate as the best way to crack the dominance of a ruling party that has been in power for seven decades. Or in Chile, where the first  Socialist president in a generation has embraced the heart of the free market economic policies first put in place by the Pinochet dictatorship.</p>
        <p>Or in Bolivia, where a former military dictator now rules as a democratically elected president in alliance with former guerrillas. Or even in Colombia, where guerrillas with Marxist origins recently took to exchanging views with visiting investors from Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Political turbulence continues to roil much of the region. Only the whiff of tear gas remains the same.</p>
