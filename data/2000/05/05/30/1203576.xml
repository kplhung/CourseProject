        <p>Tired, drained and pained by headaches, Eric Lindros is not sure if he will play hockey again.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what the future holds,'' the 27-year-old center said yesterday, less than three days after his latest concussion knocked him out of the Stanley Cup playoffs.</p>
        <p>The former captain of the Philadelphia Flyers, Lindros has had six concussions in slightly more than two years. He is considering retirement or sitting out as much as a full season.</p>
        <p>''I haven't thought about the future to the point I want to discuss it publicly,'' Lindros said, speaking after a season-ending team meeting. ''I'm tired of the whole grind of it all.''</p>
        <p>Lindros becomes a restricted free agent July 1. The Flyers must make a qualifying offer of $8.5 million -- equal to this year's salary -- to retain the rights to match another team's offer or receive compensation if he moves.</p>
        <p>Roger Neilson, Lindros's coach, yesterday denied a report that said he would return to the Flyers only as head coach.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to get permission to speak to other teams about being a head coach,'' Neilson said. ''Failing that, I'll consider everything.''</p>
        <p>The 65-year-old Neilson stepped down as coach of the Flyers to undergo cancer treatment in February. He spent the last two playoff series assisting from the press box while Craig Ramsay ran the team behind the bench.</p>
        <p>LEAGUE MEETINGS POSTPONED: The National Hockey League has postponed the general managers' meeting and draft drawing scheduled for tomorrow so that league officials can attend Maurice Richard's funeral.</p>
        <p>Richard, the first N.H.L. player to score 50 goals in a season and a national hero in Canada, died Saturday at the age of 78. He will be given a state funeral that will be televised nationally in Canada.</p>
        <p>The general managers' meetings will be rescheduled. The draft drawing was pushed back a day, to Thursday, as was the coin flip to determine the order in which expansion teams Columbus and Minnesota will draft.</p>
