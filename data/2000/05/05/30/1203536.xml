        <p>Re ''Learning at Home, Students Take the Lead'' (front page, May 24): One of the strongest arguments for keeping children in the school system is to foster the development of their social skills and their ability to get along with others from all walks of life.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Learning at Home, Students Take the Lead'' (front page, May 24): One of the strongest arguments for keeping children in the school system is to foster the development of their social skills and their ability to get along with others from all walks of life. The problem is that schools can also be breeding grounds for social comparisons that ruin self-esteem as much as they encourage it.</p>
        <p>Very early in life, those who are ''different'' in one way or another are ostracized, or ostracize themselves, into social groups based on race, gender or stereotypes that may take years to undo. If a student comes to believe that society expects less from those of his race or gender, he will expect less of himself. The answer isn't to shield children from society either, but let's not make the opposite mistake that all socialization is good.</p>
