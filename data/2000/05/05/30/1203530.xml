        <p>Rik Smits will be anxiously awaiting the pregame decision tomorrow night on Patrick Ewing. Smits, the Indiana Pacers' center, has great respect for Ewing, knows he is one of the finest centers of his generation, that he will one day be in the Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>Smits also knows that the Knicks are a much less predictable team when Ewing is cheering from the bench in street clothes. Their athleticism comes to the fore, more players get involved and they are quite successful against the Pacers, having won five of six playoff games over the last two years.</p>
        <p>So Smits hopes the tendinitis in Ewing's right foot, which has kept him out of the last two games, loosens up. He would like to see the Knicks great in uniform for Game 5.</p>
        <p>''If you look at the percentages with or without him, I guess I hope he comes back,'' Smits said.</p>
        <p>Smits, who stated last week his preference for facing Ewing rather than Kurt Thomas and Chris Dudley, was asked if the Knicks are better against the Pacers without Ewing.</p>
        <p>''It sure seems that way, doesn't it?'' he said. ''All the guys individually really step up their game. They play with a lot of intensity. That's the sign of a good team.''</p>
        <p>None of the other Pacers were willing to add fuel to Smits's fire after last night's 91-89 loss at Madison Square Garden evened the Eastern Conference finals at two games apiece. But one by one, they spoke of how the Knicks present more matchup problems for the Pacers when Ewing is not involved.</p>
        <p>Jalen Rose, who was outscored by Allan Houston, 11-3, in the first half, even said he sensed more assuredness on the part of the Knicks when playing without their big man. ''I just think they're more confident,'' Rose said. ''They get more touches, and it's a different look. It's not really a look that you can prepare for because they pretty much open it up. Jeff Van Gundy's doing a good job of putting in different plays every game that enable them to get the ball in the lane or to get the ball to people in positions where they like to score.''</p>
        <p>The Pacers say that when Ewing is not in uniform, Houston and Latrell Sprewell react like birds released from a cage. Without Ewing demanding the ball on the post, the Knicks' perimeter duo, salivating at the sight of the open lane, beats the Pacers' players off the dribble and slashes to the basket. That forces other Pacers to help, which frees up other Knicks on the perimeter.</p>
        <p>That was a major reason the Knicks made 10 of 14 3-pointers, and why Larry Johnson, in particular, was able to crush Dale Davis in the power forward matchup. Johnson made all five of his 3-point attempts and also scored on several short and midrange jump shots.</p>
        <p>The Pacers know they do not have strong one-on-one defenders, so their chances of stopping the Knicks from driving are minuscule. Mark Jackson will not stop Charlie Ward or Chris Childs from going to the basket. Reggie Miller is not going to hold Houston, and apparently Rose cannot keep Sprewell from driving, even with Sprewell's injured foot.</p>
        <p>''We don't really have a lot of athletic guys,'' Travis Best admitted. ''And they're a quicker team and they're getting out in transition, and guys are taking it upon themselves to go to the hole strong. They've been isolating us, and we haven't been able to defend that. They've been taking us one-on-one, whether it's L. J., Spree or Allan.''</p>
        <p>That analysis also accounts for why the Knicks outrebounded the Pacers by 41-32 last night for the first time in the series. When the Pacers' big men are forced to move in and help their perimeter teammates on defense, they are taken out of rebounding position, which allows the Knicks to slide in and grab boards. Witness Johnson's seven rebounds and the six apiece by Houston and Ward. Those numbers did not result from them leaping over Pacers. They resulted from Indiana's players being out of position.</p>
        <p>Ward has pretty much outplayed Jackson and Best combined the past two games. After scoring zero points in Game 2, he posted 14 points and 9 assists in Game 3 and 16 points and 7 assists last night.</p>
        <p>Best said Ward's aggressiveness, perhaps another byproduct of the freedom granted by Ewing's absence, has surprised him.</p>
        <p>''I know he's a solid point guard and I know he's athletic,'' Best said. ''I think this is the most aggressive I've seen him.''</p>
        <p>Jackson seems tickled by the talk of the Knicks benefiting from the loss of Ewing, his good friend, and he mocks those who think they are better off without him. ''If you guys think they're better without Patrick, then leave him home,'' he said. ''We look forward to not seeing him on Wednesday.''</p>
        <p>Speak for yourself, Smits says.</p>
