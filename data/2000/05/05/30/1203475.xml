        <p>Under intense public pressure to get tough, the Indonesian government placed former President Suharto under house arrest today as it sought to try him on charges of corruption and abuse of power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Suharto, 78, has been debilitated by three strokes and is apparently able to communicate -- sometimes incohererently -- only in his native Javanese language.

        <p>Under intense public pressure to get tough, the Indonesian government placed former President Suharto under house arrest today as it sought to try him on charges of corruption and abuse of power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Suharto, 78, has been debilitated by three strokes and is apparently able to communicate -- sometimes incohererently -- only in his native Javanese language. He has managed, with the help of his lawyers, to complicate repeated attempts by investigators to question him in his home.</p>
        <p>The house arrest, which does not materially change Mr. Suharto's living conditions, was instituted ''to smooth the investigation and in order to finish the case as scheduled,'' said Yushar Yahya, a spokesman for Attorney General Marzuki Darusman.</p>
        <p>The move came almost exactly two years after Mr. Suharto, the all-powerful president for 32 years, stepped down on May 21, 1998, in the face of riots and student protests and under pressure from defecting government ministers and even from his most loyal military leaders.</p>
        <p>The two-week house arrest order, renewable in 30-day increments, carried a powerful symbolism in a nation that is struggling, sometimes chaotically, to convert itself from Mr. Suharto's iron-fisted rule to an open democratic system.</p>
        <p>It responds to an overwhelming public desire for accountability that has shown itself most forcefully in frequent, sometimes violent, student demonstrations. They have taken place in the dappled streets outside Mr. Suharto's home in a quiet neighborhood of central Jakarta, where he lived throughout his presidency and retreated in calm retirement two years ago.</p>
        <p>It is also part of a broad government program to investigate and potentially mete out punishment for a broad array of abuses ranging as far back as the massacres of hundreds of thousands of people during an anti-Communist purge in 1965 and 1966, when Mr. Suharto seized power.</p>
        <p>Though he seemed halting, forgetful and confused during a round of questioning at his home this morning, said people who were there, Mr. Suhato signed an acknowledgement of the order placing him under house arrest.</p>
        <p>During the three-hour session, Mr. Suharto ''had difficulty grasping the questions, because they were too long,'' said his lawyer, Juan Felix Tampubolon. ''He haltingly tried to answer the questions, but what came out was different. There were a lot of things he could not remember.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Suharto is accused of abusing his power in issuing presidential decrees that he used to enrich himself, his six children and his cronies and supporters. The case focuses particularly on seven charitable trusts that Mr. Suharto fed by mandating donations from the national budget.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marzuki, the attorney general, has said he expects the investigation to be completed and any charges brought by Aug. 10. At that time, President Abdurrahman Wahid must present the legislature with an annual state of the nation address.</p>
        <p>But much of Mr. Suharto's wealth, estimated in the billions or even tens of billions of dollars, has so far been difficult to trace. Like the ''hidden wealth'' of Ferdinand E. Marcos, the president of the Philippines who was forced from office in 1986, it may never be recovered.</p>
        <p>''There are many ways of laundering money,'' a diplomat said. ''This was a very methodical man.''</p>
        <p>Separate investigations have been opened against some of the Suharto children who continue to control large portions of the Indonesian economy. The man known as Mr. Suharto's ''first friend,'' Bob Hasan, is also under investigation in connection with corruption allegations.</p>
        <p>These investigations, although seemingly slow and politically difficult, are one of the clearest signs that Mr. Wahid's administration represents a break with the past.</p>
        <p>His predecessor, B. J. Habibie, an acolyte of Mr. Suharto who held office for 17 months, tiptoed around the corruption issue and formally dropped an investigation as one of his last and most unpopular acts, just before being voted out of office last October.</p>
        <p>Days later, the new attorney general, Mr. Marzuki, reopened the case, and in February Mr. Suharto was formally cited as a suspect.</p>
        <p>But treading a delicate political line, Mr. Wahid said he would pardon Mr. Suharto if he was convicted, provided that the former president returned his stolen wealth to the nation.</p>
        <p>Though sick, disgraced and out of sight, Mr. Suharto remains one of the dominant personalities in Indonesia. Until two years ago he was the only president 65 percent of the population had ever known. The currency still carries his portrait.</p>
        <p>And although Mr. Suharto is out of power, his shadow still casts a chill among many Indonesians. Many see his hand, or the hand of his disenfranchised supporters, behind a continuing series of destabilizing violent incidents around the country.</p>
        <p>In the latest eruption, in the last two days at least four bombs have hit Christian churches in the Sumatran city of Medan in this largely Muslim nation. More than 60 people were reported to have been injured.</p>
        <p>Other violence that has also been fomented or aggravated by outsiders continued in the far eastern Spice Islands and in the northern Sumatran province of Aceh. In Jakarta during the weekend, student protests demanding a trial for Mr. Suharto turned violent, and many analysts and officials said they believed that the violence had been instigated by paid agitators.</p>
        <p>''When you talk of burning cars and vandalism and so on, that's not done by students,'' said Mulya Lubis, who heads a group that fights corruption. ''That's done by people who want to provoke chaos.''</p>
        <p>Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono said: ''There are a lot of people disgruntled with government, including former cabinet members, both civilian and military. They have too much money and nothing to do, and they want to frustrate the Gus Dur,'' the nickname of President Wahid.</p>
        <p>The house arrest order will allow investigators to question the former president every day if they choose to, Mr. Yahya said. He added without elaborating that it would also ''prevent him from destroying evidence.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tampubolon objected, saying the house arrest order ''deviated from the proper procedure, so we feel that it is a baseless decision.''</p>
        <p>''There is no legal basis for such a move,'' he said. ''Security is in the hands of the police, not the attorney general.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the order was something of a retreat for Mr. Marzuki, who had said he planned to move Mr. Suharto into government custody elsewhere. That suggestion received opposition even from within the cabinet, with some members calling it excessively harsh and warning about the fragility of the former president's health.</p>
        <p>Taking a hard line, Mr. Marzuki warned on Friday that the large deployment of police officers that has held protesters at bay in front of Mr. Suharto's house would be withdrawn if Mr. Suharto did not begin to offer more cooperation to investigators.</p>
        <p>It is not clear, though, how the formal detention order will affect the course of the questioning, which apparently proceeded as best it could earlier in the morning.</p>
        <p>''The target has been met, meaning that all the questions have been answered,'' said Dr. Supardi Sudibyo, head of the state-appointed medical team for Mr. Suharto.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tampubolon had tried to cut short the session, complaining that Mr. Suharto's blood pressure had soared when he had been questioned about the charitable foundations. But Dr. Sudibyo said the former president's blood pressure ''normally goes up after a questioning session.''</p>
