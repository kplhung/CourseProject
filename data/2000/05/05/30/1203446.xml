        <p>Ever since designers and fashion editors started tossing about the term ''ladylike dressing'' like a threadbare muffler from Gimbel's, one has had the feeling they don't know what they are talking about. Oh, sure, they have contacts in the world of thin women -- what is Vogue if not an illustrated Social Register? And there's no telling how many designers have set their speed dials to BUtterfield-8.</p>
        <p>But just because the fall collections are loaded with examples of upper-echelon chic doesn't mean they jibe with the reality.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there is any such thing as ladylike dressing, said Nan Kempner, the Park Avenue hostess and champion clotheshorse. ''I think you're the lady and the clothes are just a reflection of you.''</p>
        <p>Certainly, Mrs. Kempner, who will be 70 in July, is unique, with her 40 years of wearing Saint Laurent couture. ''I mean,'' her friend Bill Blass said, ''have you ever had the statistics on what Nan has purchased or seen?'' But as she herself would point out, she isn't the only socialite with an informed view of the new dressing up.</p>
        <p>Here are four women -- Amanda Hearst, Brooke de Ocampo, Mrs. Kempner and Brooke Astor, four generations of New York women, age 16 to 98 -- defining what it means to dress like a lady.</p>
        <p>Outgrowing Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</p>
        <p>''I was just at Scoop and I bought a lavender tube top and a pair of hazel capri pants in linen,'' said Amanda Hearst, the 16-year-old daughter of Anne Hearst and a great-granddaughter of William Randolph Hearst.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hearst is blond and pretty and very poised. A sophomore at a boarding school, she follows what's in fashion. ''I buy stuff at Prada, but mostly it's shoes and coats,'' she said. ''That's what my friends and I do. I also like stuff from Tocca and Katayone Adeli. Stuff you see on Barneys eighth floor. We really don't go in for the top labels.''</p>
        <p>Lately, Ms. Hearst said, she has noticed a sea change among her friends, even as they slave away at school. ''Last year the look was Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and Ralph Lauren polo shirts and khaki pants,'' she said. ''Right now, we're into blow drying our hair, wearing delicate jewelry and clothes that fit, especially skirts. We're always into makeup.''</p>
        <p>But can a tube top be ladylike?</p>
        <p>''Yeah, I think so,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ladylike Without the Rules</p>
        <p>''The girls who come to us are, for lack of a better word, more earthy,'' said Josh Patner of the dress house Tuleh. ''The Nan Kempners of the world, in my imagination, float on clouds. Brooke very much is putting her heel to the pavement.''</p>
        <p>He was referring to Brooke de Ocampo.</p>
        <p>With three small children, a busy social life with her husband, Emilio, and a book in the works with the photographer Jonathan Becker, Ms. de Ocampo, at 33, has a lot on her mind other than clothes. Yet, every day she gets dressed as if she's going somewhere -- last Monday, in a white Marc Jacobs peasant top with fuchsia Helmut Lang trousers and Manolo Blahnik sandals. ''I'm dressed in a way that helps me get things done,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. de Ocampo is part of a junior crowd of socialites, though none really like the term. Still, it was obvious to her and her friends that a number of designers, notably Michael Kors, were thinking of this younger group when they showed their ladylike fall collections. ''Some of these designers are pals of mine,'' she said hesitantly, ''but what they were doing looked like a caricature of all of us.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''I feel that if you're going to have a cashmere coat with fur, then show it with jeans and high-heeled boots. It would look ladylike without looking stamped.''</p>
        <p>In a sense, what Ms. de Ocampo and women her age want is a put-together look that still says girlishly casual, even sexy. She brought out a couple of things from her closet: a cinnamon-and-pink polka dot Tuleh skirt she has worn with a hot-pink sweater, and a purple chiffon Helmut Lang top she wore with pants to a dressy Sotheby's dinner.</p>
        <p>''I hardly ever wear suits,'' she said. The last time she did was for a wedding. It was by Chloe, and it fit beautifully, she said. ''The skirt was practically riding on my hips.''</p>
        <p>Dressed to Please</p>
        <p>To give some idea how crazy Nan Kempner is for clothes, in 1957, when she was pregnant with one of her three children, she had her maternity clothes made at Patou in Paris.</p>
        <p>''Don't you love that?'' she said one afternoon in the Park Avenue duplex where she and her husband, the investment banker Thomas Kempner, have lived for 42 years.</p>
        <p>What is more, the clothes were made by Karl Lagerfeld, then known at Patou as Mr. Karl. Mrs. Kempner shrugged. ''Everybody's got to start somewhere,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She had just come from having lunch at Swifty's, which she treats like a canteen, and she had on a beige sweater with a 20-year-old Saint Laurent python skirt. ''Everything recycles,'' she said. ''So if you keep clothes long enough, you have a good wardrobe.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kempner doesn't wear only couture, but she buys a lot of it, and at half price, since the samples fit her. ''Couture is like a second skin -- it moves with you,'' she said. ''And the more you wear it, the better it feels. You break it in.'' She added, apropos of both Saint Laurent and herself, ''If you've got a great look, you don't really improve it. You master it.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kempner, who recently bought a cream-colored Saint Laurent pantsuit and a leopard chiffon blouse (''I'm mad about that shirt,'' she said), thinks the most important thing about dressing is to put yourself together -- and then forget about it.</p>
        <p>''I dress to be appealing -- to anything and everybody,'' Mrs. Kempner said. ''That's a wonderful thing about Brooke Astor. She always dresses appropriately. And when she goes to these big charity things, sure, she brings out all the jewelry. Why not? Everybody wants to see it.''</p>
        <p>So dressing is a social grace?</p>
        <p>''You got it. You dress to please people.''</p>
        <p>And Don't Forget Your Hat</p>
        <p>Recently, in one of a series of articles she has written for Vanity Fair about modern manners, Mrs. Astor recalled some advice from her grandmother: A lady should always leave something on her plate.</p>
        <p>''On looking back,'' she wrote, ''I recognize a philosophy behind this admonition. To want to enjoy one's dinner is correct, but greed is not.'' Mrs. Astor, every bit the lady, has given millions to worthy causes.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I dress so extraordinarily,'' she said by phone.</p>
        <p>Though feeling a bit under the weather, she  was on her way to her home in Maine. ''Some of my suits I've worn for ages, because they're taken very good care of,'' she said. ''I have a very good French maid whom I've had for years. She always sees that all my clothes are in very good condition. I buy a couple of new evening dresses every year. I buy Balmain from my friend Oscar. I like those clothes very much.</p>
        <p>''I always wear a hat -- you see, I was brought up to all that. Wearing a hat is also good for your eyes. My eyes are marvelous. I can see right the way across the river. Which at 98, is pretty good.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Astor had some plain old wisdom for the new business of dressing up. ''I think your clothes should be very clean and fresh and always in good shape,'' she said. ''I think all your things ought to be in order. Go along that way, and you'll be all right.''</p>
