        <p>Representative Robert D. Franks, just in from Washington and a vote on the House floor, breezed into a candidates' night not long ago at the Days Inn in Roxbury, N.J., wearing his political experience as comfortably as his unwrinkled dark suit.</p>
        <p>After some small talk about the cloud formations he had seen as his plane landed, Mr. Franks ticked off a series of accomplishments of the Republican majority in Congress, and argued that his party deserved more credit than President Clinton did for the declining budget deficits and the roaring economy. Then he moved on to his role on the Transportation Committee and the specifics of legislation to ease congestion on state roads.</p>
        <p>''I'm the one candidate in this race who has served in federal office,'' said Mr. Franks, a four-term member of Congress who is among the four Republicans seeking the party's Senate nomination in the June 6  primary. ''And I believe I have accumulated the experience to weigh in on your behalf.''</p>
        <p>Such declarations of Beltway familiarity sometimes breed contempt -- or paeans to  term limits -- but Bob Franks projects his Washington experience as a plus.</p>
        <p>He has spent a lifetime steeped in politics and government. It started at age 15, when he worked as a youth coordinator in an early State Assembly campaign of Thomas H. Kean, who would later become governor.  Mr. Franks himself was elected to the Assembly at 28, and later served as the state Republican chairman from 1989 to 1992, the year he won his seat in Congress.</p>
        <p>During that rise he forged relationships with county leaders, healed divisions in the state party and exuded an earnestness and ambition that Mr. Kean said came across to most as ''a love and enthusiasm for government that is very rare.''</p>
        <p>''But he's different from a career politician, because he takes courageous stands,'' said Mr. Kean, a reference to their shared views in favor of abortion rights and on other social issues. ''He is one of those people who can bring people together in the center, because he is not off to the right or the left.''</p>
        <p>Despite these encouraging words, the former governor has not endorsed anyone in the primary race, which also includes State Senator William L. Gormley, another of his longtime political allies. The other candidates are James W. Treffinger, the Essex County executive, and Murray Sabrin, a former Libertarian.</p>
        <p>Still, in a state where Republicans seeking to advance to higher office are stacked up like jets waiting to land in fog at Newark International Airport, Mr. Franks has had his share of problems lately in promoting amity and bringing people together. His ''career track,'' according to one prominent Republican, had always pointed toward running for governor in 2001.</p>
        <p>But that goal put him on a collision course with his fellow Union County Republican, Donald T. DiFrancesco, the State Senate president. That played out in a battle for control of the Union County Republican Party chairmanship in 1998, a fight Mr. DiFrancesco's side won.</p>
        <p>When Gov. Christine Todd Whitman decided last fall not to run for the Senate seat being vacated by Frank R. Lautenberg, Mr. Franks  averted any further confrontation by shifting to the Senate race. But it may be a temporary cease-fire. ''Bob's modus operandi is collaboration,'' one Republican leader said, ''but all bets may be off if he doesn't win the Senate nomination and decides to return to a run for governor.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Franks, 48, admitted that as a career politician, he could face hostility from time to time. But he has tried to blunt the label by voluntarily returning 5 percent of his annual Congressional salary of $141,300, adopting a gift ban in his Congressional office and donating his frequent flier miles to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, which grants wishes to children with life-threatening illnesses.</p>
        <p>''I'm not your father's politician,'' he said, ''and that's why I have won consistently in a district that has 22,000 more Democrats than Republicans.'' He was born in Hackensack but spent part of his childhood in the Chicago suburb of Glen Ellyn.</p>
        <p>It was there that his passion for politics seems to have surfaced. At 13, he found himself drawn to a storefront plastered with campaign posters for Charles Percy, a Republican candidate for governor of Illinois.  Mr. Franks said he walked in and emerged with the job of handing out campaign literature, ''a fun thing to do.'' Mr. Percy lost, but two years later Mr. Franks worked on his successful Senate campaign.</p>
        <p>Soon after, the Franks family returned to New Jersey. Mr. Franks recalled his father, a pharmaceuticals salesman, softening the blow of the relocation by telling him that their new community of Summit was staunchly Republican. The teenager  quickly became active in the party, helping to resuscitate the local Young Republicans and recruiting volunteers in local campaigns.</p>
        <p>He attended college at DePauw University in Greencastle, Ind., and later earned a law degree from Southern Methodist University in Dallas.</p>
        <p>After returning to New Jersey, he began his political career in earnest, with a plan to run for the Board of Freeholders in Union County in 1979. But then a veteran state senator decided to step down, allowing the area's Republican assemblyman to move up. Mr. Franks set his sights on Trenton. He won, and served 13 years in the Assembly.</p>
        <p>By 1989, the Republicans were in disarray, unable to hold the governor's mansion against the onslaught of Jim Florio. The party chairman resigned, and Mr. Franks, who had developed a reputation as a diligent lawmaker who could bring factions together, was tapped to be leader of the state party.</p>
        <p>Three years later, Representative Matthew Rinaldi, a veteran Republican, left the party in the lurch when he resigned and ended his re-election bid just three months short of the general election. The well-liked Mr. Franks was a shoo-in as a last-minute replacement.</p>
        <p>In the race for the Senate nomination, Mr. Gormley has raised the most money, but Mr. Franks is not far behind with his goal of raising $2.5 million for the primary. And he has something that Mr. Gormley does not, Sheriff Edward Rochford of Morris County said: a grass-roots network around the state made up of people whom Mr. Franks helped as a state legislator, party chairman and congressman.</p>
        <p>''I met him when he was my instructor in Republican 'candidates school' when I first ran in 1992,'' Sheriff Rochford said. ''He taught me what he does, and that is to try to make most of the people accept you  by sitting down and explaining your positions to them and by embracing your opponents and not going negative.''</p>
        <p>That has changed some in the thick of the battle with Mr. Gormley, as Mr. Franks has been aggressive  in recent debates.</p>
        <p>Glenn Paulsen, the Republican chairman in Burlington County and a Franks supporter, recalled how 11 years ago when Mr. Paulsen sought to oust a longtime Republican officeholder who had made a racial slur, Mr. Franks, then party chairman, stood with him ''without flinching and on principle.'' Mr. Franks used to show up unannounced at the campaign headquarters to help out.</p>
        <p>''He seemed young but tremendously energetic, and you knew this wasn't just another politician, but a real guy,'' Mr. Paulsen said. ''So when he announced that he was running for the Senate nomination, I didn't hesitate and was on the phone to him asking what he needed me to do.''</p>
        <p>One of the keys to Mr. Franks's seeming broad appeal is his moderate record. While he voted with the Republican majority to impeach President Clinton and joined with  Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, in pushing the Republican Contract With America in 1994, he continued to be moderate on domestic economic issues as well as on foreign policy, while liberal on many of the social and cultural issues dear to conservative Republicans.</p>
        <p>''On the core values of the Republican Party, which are freedom, economic opportunity, personal responsibility, I'm a bedrock Republican,'' Mr. Franks said. ''While in Washington I have concentrated on sending the power and the authority back to the states.''</p>
