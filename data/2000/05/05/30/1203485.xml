        <p>A court here delayed a decision today on whether to release two abducted Lebanese guerrilla leaders whose freedom has been demanded by Hezbollah as a condition for halting anti-Israeli hostilities.</p>
        <p>Judge Uri Goren of the Tel Aviv District Court said he would rule on July 12 on the cases of Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid of Hezbollah, or Party of God, and Mustafa Dirani of the Amal movement, who have been held without trial since they were forcibly taken from Lebanon.</p>
        <p>Sheik Obeid, 43, was seized in 1989, and Mr. Dirani, 49, was taken in 1994 -- both as bargaining chips for the release of Capt. Ron Arad, an Israeli airman whose plane went down over Lebanon in 1986.</p>
        <p>The court hearing was the first time the men had appeared in public since their abduction. Earlier hearings were behind closed doors.</p>
        <p>Wearing a full gray beard and a large white skullcap, Sheik Obeid sat  next to the bearded Mr. Dirani as both men followed the proceedings through an interpreter.</p>
        <p>Hezbollah leaders have asserted that they will continue fighting Israel until it releases the two guerrillas and other Lebanese prisoners.</p>
        <p>The United Nations special envoy to the Middle East, Terje Roed Larsen, who is verifying the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, said on Sunday that Israel's release of the Lebanese prisoners ''would give an additional impetus to the restoration of international peace and security in the area.''</p>
        <p>Aside from Sheik Obeid and Mr. Dirani, the Israeli authorities say they are holding 15 other Lebanese prisoners, who have been convicted of attacks in the former Israeli-held zone in southern Lebanon.</p>
        <p>Foreign Minister David Levy said today that none of the prisoners could be released at this time and that everything depended on whether quiet would prevail along the Israeli-Lebanese border.</p>
        <p>The court hearing centered on the question of whether Sheik Obeid and Mr. Dirani posed a danger to Israeli security.</p>
        <p>Following a Supreme Court ruling last month that barred holding Lebanese prisoners as bargaining chips, the government has argued that Sheik Obeid and Mr. Dirani should stay in jail because they pose a security risk.</p>
        <p>''They've become a symbol for the struggle of the terrorist organizations against Israel,'' said Devora Chen, the government attorney. ''If they are released, they will continue to play an active role in the terrorist organizations and go back to very senior positions there.''</p>
        <p>Zvi Rish, the lawyer for the guerrillas, responded that now that Israel has withdrawn from Lebanon, his clients no longer pose a risk, because they had vowed to fight Israel until it pulled out.</p>
        <p>''When they leave Lebanon, that's the end,'' he quoted Sheik Obeid as saying.</p>
        <p>''If we're talking about state security, it could be that the danger lies in the very continuation of their imprisonment,'' Mr. Rish told the judge, alluding to the Hezbollah threats to fight on if the prisoners are not freed.</p>
        <p>Sheik Obeid and Mr. Dirani, in remarks reported by their lawyer and translator, sounded a similar warning, saying their continued imprisonment could lead to increased tension and anti-Israeli attacks.</p>
        <p>At the conclusion of the hearing, Mr. Dirani asked to give his version of the disappearance of Captain Arad, whom he held prisoner before the airman vanished.</p>
        <p>Speaking briefly before he was cut off by the judge, Mr. Dirani said the airman was ''stolen'' by Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Bekaa region in April 1988 when his captors left him in a rush to identify bodies of guerrillas killed in an Israeli attack on the village of Maidun. Mr. Dirani said he had made a ''great effort'' to recover the airman, but Israel ''complicated the situation'' and assassinated the Hezbollah leader Sheik Abbas Musawi.</p>
        <p>Judge Goren ruled that given ''the newness of the issue'' and in order to examine further arguments made today, he would decide the case on July 12. Until then, he said, the guerrilla leaders will remain in jail.</p>
