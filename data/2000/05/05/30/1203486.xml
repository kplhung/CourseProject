        <p>Yankee Victor outran seven of the fastest milers in racing yesterday and added his name to a long and distinguished list of star horses when he won the 107th running of the Metropolitan Handicap at Belmont Park.</p>
        <p>It was the fourth victory in his last five starts, and he flew home in 1:343/5 , beating the filly Honest Lady by four and three-quarter lengths and last year's winner, Sir Bear, by three-quarters of a length more. Farther back came Big Jag, who won the Dubai Golden Shaheen in March, and Richter Scale, who had won four straight stakes before finishing sixth yesterday.</p>

        <p>Yankee Victor outran seven of the fastest milers in racing yesterday and added his name to a long and distinguished list of star horses when he won the 107th running of the Metropolitan Handicap at Belmont Park.</p>
        <p>It was the fourth victory in his last five starts, and he flew home in 1:343/5 , beating the filly Honest Lady by four and three-quarter lengths and last year's winner, Sir Bear, by three-quarters of a length more. Farther back came Big Jag, who won the Dubai Golden Shaheen in March, and Richter Scale, who had won four straight stakes before finishing sixth yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Met Mile, a kind of defining race for mile runners in New York, has been won by legendary horses like Equipoise, Native Dancer and Forego. And for Yankee Victor, a 4-year-old son of Saint Ballado who has won 8 of his 18 starts, it could open the way to stardom.</p>
        <p>''Everything went our way,'' said Carlos Morales, who trains Yankee Victor. ''I asked for no rain because he doesn't like a wet track, and it didn't rain. I asked for nice weather, because it is better for him when it is cooler. And I asked to be outside the other speeds, and I was outside both of them.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Yankee Victor was outside everybody in the gate, breaking from the No. 8 post position. He wasted no time closing on the heels of Straight Man, who led for a quarter-mile before fading to eighth place. For a while, Richter Scale gave chase, but by the time Yankee Victor solidified his lead as they turned for home, it was Sir Bear and Big Jag in pursuit. But at the finish, Yankee Victor had nearly five lengths on Honest Lady, who closed from last place to second.</p>
        <p>Yankee Victor, third choice in the betting at 4-1, paid $10.60 for a $2 bet to win and earned $460,000. He has finished in the money 12 times, and Morales said his next start might come in the $100,000 Hanshin Handicap at Arlington Park on June 25 -- at one mile, naturally. ''I would like to keep him at a mile,'' Morales said, with appreciation. ''There is no sense in changing.''</p>
        <p>Heberto Castillo Jr., who rode Yankee Victor, said, ''This horse was on top of his game.''</p>
        <p>Ralph Ziadie, the trainer of Sir Bear, who is 7 years old and entered the race with a 4-for-4 record at one mile, said: ''I was hoping for more pace, but they went the first quarter in 23 seconds, and that was slower than I wanted.''</p>
        <p>Jerry Bailey, the jockey on Honest Lady, the only filly in the race, said: ''She ran great. We saved ground, and I angled her out for the drive. She was moving, but no one was going to beat the winner.''</p>
