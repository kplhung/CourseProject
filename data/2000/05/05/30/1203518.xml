        <p>Theirs is a familiar procession through Family Court.</p>
        <p>Sometimes barely old enough to shave but charged with crimes, both felonies and misdemeanors, they shuffle in before a judge for violating the terms of their probation. They are locked up as they await trial, swelling the population of the city's juvenile detention facilities.</p>
        <p>And if found guilty and ordered incarcerated, they usually return to court, their youthful forays into criminal activity likely to turn them into recurrent adult criminals.</p>
        <p>Now, to block the revolving doors of the juvenile justice system, officials with the state court are planning to establish a specialized court to keep a vigilant eye on young probation violators.</p>
        <p>More than a third of juvenile delinquents -- children under 16 charged with felonies and misdemeanors and tried in Family Court -- who are put on probation violate the terms of the sentence, by missing an appointment or failing a drug test, or sometimes by being arrested for another offense.</p>
        <p>Under the new plan, they will not be supervised by probation officers alone. A Family Court judge will keep tabs on them directly. The youths' school records will be examined, since law enforcement officials consider truancy to be an indicator of more dangerous forms of misbehavior.</p>
        <p>They will be tested for drugs and offered treatment if needed as soon as they come into court. Court employees who report directly to the judge will refer the youngsters and their families to whatever services are deemed needed to keep the youngsters out of trouble. A judge will summon the youngsters back to court as often as needed.</p>
        <p>The new court, said Judge Jonathan Lippman, the chief administrative judge of the state courts, is intended for those put on probation and thought to be at risk of failing the terms of the sentence. It is aimed at ''the ones who are really on the cusp,'' he said, ''that can go either way, and to give them the intensive monitoring, the treatment, the family intervention so they don't go the wrong way.''</p>
        <p>Scheduled to start this summer as a pilot project in the Bronx and eventually to handle 100 to 150 cases a year, the new project joins a constellation of small, specialized state courts that have been set up in recent years. Each court has a target population, a judge that sees arrestees' cases from start to finish and court staff hired to evaluate their social service needs as well as matters of law and order.</p>
        <p>A special court in Brooklyn handles domestic violence cases. A judge in Manhattan Family Court deals with child welfare cases involving parents who agree to treatment for drug and alcohol abuse. In the criminal system, special courts  offer treatment to low-level drug offenders.</p>
        <p>The new juvenile probation court, officials said, is based on the premise that more vigilance can save the youngsters from being swallowed up by a life of crime.</p>
        <p>''Juveniles, by nature, are in their formative years,'' Judge Lippman said. ''They may have just dipped their toe in criminal or semicriminal conduct.''</p>
        <p>The new court will be run by Judge Clark V. Richardson, the supervising judge in Family Court in the Bronx, and is expected to cost $100,000 a year, 10 percent more than what it costs to detain one youngster for a year.</p>
