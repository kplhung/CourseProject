        <p>Without false modesty or subtle psychological manipulation, Coach Ken Hitchcock verified today what most people already knew: that his Dallas Stars are expected to beat the Devils in the Stanley Cup finals, which begin on Tuesday night in Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>''I think we should be the favorites because we're the defending champions,'' Hitchcock said. But he quickly added that such an evaluation can change as soon as these two unfamiliar teams play the first period of their four-of-seven-games championship round.</p>
        <p>As both squads gathered for news conferences on a holiday afternoon, coaches and players spoke carefully of rivals who, in some respects, reflect each other in personnel, style and history.</p>
        <p>Both have won the trophy in recent seasons -- Dallas over Buffalo last spring, the Devils over Detroit in 1995.</p>
        <p>Both teams survived seven-game conference finals this spring: the Stars over Colorado in the West, the Devils over Philadelphia in the East.</p>
        <p>Both captains are big defensemen -- Derian Hatcher of the Stars, Scott Stevens of the Devils -- whose body-check totals far exceed their scoring statistics.</p>
        <p>Both have top goalies in Ed Belfour of the Stars and Martin Brodeur of the Devils.</p>
        <p>Because they met only twice this season -- with Dallas winning both games, 2-1 and 3-2 -- it might take a while for these opponents to figure each other out. Kirk Muller, a Stars veteran, noted that both teams are coming off triumphs over close rivals and that it might take time for the finals to reach the same level of intensity.</p>
        <p>''It's easy to get up for those games,'' Muller said of rivalries within the conference. ''When you throw an Eastern and Western team together, sometimes it takes a couple games to kind of get that hate going again. But I don't think our team can afford that. We don't have home-ice advantage.''</p>
        <p>According to Joe Nieuwendyk, a Dallas center: ''Both teams are very similar. Obviously, both goaltenders are solid. The defensemen are big and physical. There's a lot of skilled forwards on both teams. Both teams are almost a mirror image. It will be interesting to see how it plays out.''</p>
        <p>But they are not so similar in the scoring forward roles. Although the line of Jason Arnott, Patrik Elias and Petr Sykora leads the Devils with 17 playoff goals, that total does not even equal that of the Dallas's Mike Modano and Brett Hull, who have combined for 18.</p>
        <p>Both are older and more experienced than the Devils' snipers. Hull scored five times in the seven games against Colorado. Last season, he scored the game-winner in overtime against Buffalo to clinch the championship in Game 6 of the finals.</p>
        <p>Hull played that game with groin and knee injuries. Modano played most of that series with a broken wrist. In the Colorado series that ended last Saturday night, Modano left Game 6 after a check by Adam Foote injured his leg and his head.</p>
        <p>He returned later in that game and, in Game 7, scored a goal and an assist. Modano was once thought to be a soft player who did not compete well against a physical challenge. Hull was said to be a fun-loving individual who lacked the dedication to play for a championship.</p>
        <p>''Well, It's always an ongoing battle with people's opinions about how I play and how it's come full circle,'' Modano said. ''When I first came in the league, you have certain perceptions people make about you. Those are hard to change. It's taken a long time to do that. I have grown to enjoy the physical part of the game.''</p>
        <p>It comes to him because teams think they can stop the Stars if they stop Modano. So they hit him, often and hard. ''I just have to deal with it and work through it,'' Modano said.</p>
        <p>Regarding the collision with Foote that sent him limping off the ice, Modano said that he suffered a charley horse and that Foote's stick ''kind of got me in the jaw a little bit.''</p>
        <p>''I was a bit stunned,'' he said. ''I needed some time to get off the ice and get regrouped.''</p>
        <p>Hull, who often tests the patience of his coaches, seems to have a pleasantly edgy relationship with Hitchcock. They sparred orally at the podium today.</p>
        <p>When asked if their relationship was a work in progress, Hull said, ''I'm still working on it.'' Hitchcock said of Hull: ''I like the music that he likes. I like that he is great at crossword puzzles. We still pretty much disagree on everything hockey-wise. He either plays my way or doesn't go on the ice and he knows that.'' Both men were smiling as the coach said this.</p>
        <p>Some perceive that Hull has altered his attacking style a bit to conform to the demands of Hitchcock's defensive approach.</p>
        <p>Stevens, a Devil defenseman, played with Hull for one season in St. Louis and noticed a difference in a recent game. ''I saw him the other day trying to block a shot, which I had never seen him do before,'' Stevens said. ''He is playing more of a team game. Probably being in Dallas a lot has rubbed off on him. But, obviously, he is still very good at scoring and he is having his best playoffs yet. We have to keep a close eye on him.''</p>
        <p>Several Stars and their coach said pointedly that hockey teams gain special recognition not by winning just one championship but by repeating the next season.</p>
        <p>Detroit did it in 1997 and 1998; Pittsburgh did it in 1991 and 1992; Edmonton won five times in seven seasons from 1984 through 1990, but never more than twice in succession. The last team to do better was the Islanders, winning four in a row from 1980 through 1983.</p>
        <p>''There is a certain status that goes with teams that have won two cups, especially two in a row,'' Hitchcock said. ''And we want that status badly.''</p>
