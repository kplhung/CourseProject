        <p>Breaking ranks with the powerful ''Wintel duopoly,'' based on Intel hardware and Microsoft software, Gateway and America Online plan to announce on Tuesday that they will use a processor from an upstart Silicon Valley chip maker and a version of the Linux operating system in a new Internet home appliance scheduled to go on sale later this year.</p>
        <p>The decision is a big victory for the Transmeta Corporation, a chip design company in Santa Clara, Calif., that has developed a microprocessor intended to be a low-power and inexpensive alternative to Intel's microprocessors.</p>
        <p>Transmeta, which was founded five years ago by David Ditzel, the former Sun Microsystems hardware designer, with backing from George Soros, the financier; Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder; Deutsche Bank; and others, said last month that it had raised an additional $88 million in financing from Compaq Computer, Gateway, Samsung, Sony and a number of Taiwanese manufacturers.</p>
        <p>The deal is a portent of the arrival of what is being popularly referred to as the post-PC computing era, a world in which the personal computer is displaced by an expanding array of digital cellular phones, personal digital assistants, Webpads, which are tablet-style computers, and other appliance-like devices.</p>
        <p>Both Intel and Microsoft have largely resisted this vision, maintaining instead that the PC will remain at the center of the computing world for many years to come and that the new devices will function more or less as peripherals to a central PC.</p>
        <p>Gateway executives on Friday said that they decided to break with Intel and Microsoft because the new devices were not personal computers.</p>
        <p>''We're not building a personal computer, we're building an appliance,'' said Peter Ashkin, Gateway's senior vice president and chief technology officer. ''Hence, there was no strong requirement for Windows.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashkin said the choice of the Transmeta chip was appropriate to the new devices, which are intended to sit on the kitchen counter or the desk in the den and eventually be carried around the home as wireless Webpads always connected to the Internet.</p>
        <p>He said Transmeta turned out to be an excellent choice. ''Their chip offered a unique combination of low power and low cost,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Many executives in the computer industry believe that the next generation of computing will offer fresh opportunities for competitors like Transmeta to offer alternatives to the dominant industry powers.</p>
        <p>''This is Microsoft off the desktop, and Intel out from inside the desktop,'' said Robert Enderle, a market researcher who is vice president for desktop and mobile technologies at the Giga Information Group.</p>
        <p>The challenge to the Wintel duopoly is a replay of an earlier skirmish that became one of the central points of contention in the Microsoft antitrust trial last year.</p>
        <p>During the trial, a Gateway executive, James Von Holle, served as a witness for the Justice Department and described how Microsoft had put pressure on Gateway after it pursued a strategy of installing the Netscape browser and placing an AOL icon on the desktop of its computers.</p>
        <p>Now both America Online and Gateway have potentially found a way to displace Microsoft's software entirely by using a special version of the free Linux operating system that will run the Netscape browser customized for each company's online service.</p>
        <p>''People are definitely willing to take more risks today,'' Mr. Ditzel said. ''The truth is that the phrase Internet appliance has become a code word in the industry meaning 'no Windows.' ''</p>
        <p>In addition to the Internet appliance market, Transmeta is also trying to push into the market for portable computers. The first portables based on the Transmeta chips are likely to be announced next month at the PC Expo computer trade show in New York City, Mr. Ditzel said.</p>
        <p>Transmeta gained significant visibility in January when, after five years as a secret design laboratory, it announced two new chips that were compatible with Intel's X86 design, which include the Pentium chips, yet consumed only about one watt of power, much more efficient than Intel's. The company's microprocessors use a novel Very Long Instruction Word, or V.L.I.W., processing approach that tries to simplify computing hardware by shifting many functions to software.</p>
        <p>Intel has since shown a technology demonstration of one of its chips consuming only about a watt of power. Many analysts, however, are skeptical that the chip-making giant can push aggressively into the low-power market without harming its other businesses.</p>
        <p>Early on, Transmeta garnered a great deal of attention when it hired Linus Torvalds, a Finnish programmer who created and led the open-source effort to develop the Linux operating system as a free alternative to Microsoft's and other operating system programs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ditzel said on Friday that Mr. Torvalds had led an effort to modify Linux to run without a hard disk to make it usable by inexpensive consumer appliances. Gateway executives said on Friday that the first ''tethered'' version of the new Internet appliance would go on sale during the fourth quarter and that wireless versions would be available some time in the future.</p>
        <p>Gateway will sell the machines through its network of 260 retail stores, while America Online will market them directly to its subscribers. Neither company is certain about the final price of the product, which is aimed at below $500.</p>
        <p>''There's a place up on my wall where people come in and scribble numbers between $99 and $499,'' Mr. Ashkin said.</p>
