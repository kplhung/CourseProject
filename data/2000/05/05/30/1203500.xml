        <p>Of all the dying mill towns in New England, this was the deadest.</p>
        <p>By the mid-1980's, 70 percent of its storefronts were empty. The Sprague Electric Company, the city's largest employer and long its dominant presence, closed in 1985, putting 4,137 people out of work and affecting virtually every family in North Adams, a city of 18,000.</p>
        <p>The unemployment rate, the highest in Massachusetts, ran from 25 percent to 30 percent. The local newspaper kept a front-page box score on plant closings. A developer suggested that the whole town, at the foot of steep mountains, be flooded to provide lakefront property.</p>
        <p>''We had hit rock bottom,'' recalled John Barrett III, the city's mayor for the last 17 years. ''We were the butt of jokes. The Adams Print Works closed, another 2,200 jobs. The hotel went bankrupt; it was the third time. Everything was bankrupt.''</p>
        <p>But now North Adams is in renaissance, a nascent Soho in the Berkshires.</p>
        <p>More than two-thirds of the town's shops are occupied, including a downtown-slick restaurant, 55 Main, with spotlights and arty furnishings. Artists have moved into some of the long brick mills, and one old mill  houses a farm that grows shiitake mushrooms.</p>
        <p>This month, plans were announced for a $5 million project to turn a deteriorating stretch of Victorian houses into a bed and breakfast to be run by the Red Lion Inn of nearby Stockbridge.</p>
        <p>''I think it's wonderful to have an excuse to be doing something in North Adams. I think it's a great place,'' said Nancy Fitzpatrick, president of the Red Lion, a favorite with the crowd that frequents Tanglewood.</p>
        <p>The unlikely catalyst of this change, a gigantic museum in an abandoned factory featuring maple trees growing upside down and sculptures made out of tons of industrial debris, was nearly hooted out of existence as a $35 million boondoggle before it could be born.</p>
        <p>''You've got to understand, everybody laughed at this,'' said Mr. Barrett, who remembers and bristles at every slight North Adams has ever suffered.</p>
        <p>In the year since it opened last Memorial Day weekend, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, known as Mass MOCA, has been hailed as a wild success, drawing more than 105,000 visitors to its galleries, 25,000 more to performing arts events, garnering architectural and preservation awards, and, in an arrangement that is crucial to its financial security, renting commercial space to eight tenants so far, with 60,000 square feet scheduled to be occupied by October.</p>
        <p>It was a hard, 14-year struggle into being, a cliffhanger of state funding cut-offs, small-scale fund-raising,  deadlines missed and extended, plans juggled and changed.</p>
        <p>Much of the credit goes to Mr. Barrett, the blue-collar mayor, and Joseph C. Thompson, a soft-spoken art historian from Williams College via Oklahoma, who has devoted most of his working life to the project.</p>
        <p>Refusing to give up a dream, Mr. Thompson and his development director, Jennifer Trainer, went for months without pay, turned down lucrative job offers and, along the way, fell in love, married and now have an infant son. And an infant museum.</p>
        <p>''Without Joe, this wouldn't have happened,'' said Michael Conforte, director of the Clark Art Institute in neighboring Williamstown.</p>
        <p>Mass MOCA also owes much to three post-modern phenomena.</p>
        <p>The first is the tendency of artists to create works that, although they are called minimalist, are huge, so huge that art experts say 90 percent of them cannot be exhibited. Some are so big and so minimalist that they do not even exist; they are just instructions as to how to build them in the unlikely event there should be room.</p>
        <p>The second phenomenon, as manufacturing is abandoned, is the existence of big empty industrial spaces.  New York's Soho neighborhood was a manufacturing center, after all, before artists (and later investment bankers) inhabited its lofts.</p>
        <p>The third, is the explosive growth of e-commerce and Internet companies in this region, which is being called the Silicon Village. Web companies are among the museum's main tenants, including eZiba.com,  which markets exotic crafts over the Internet.</p>
        <p>The museum also owes much to Williams College, five miles to the west. Williams gave crucial initial backing to the museum. Some of the college's wealthy and well-connected alumni, who bear a fond allegiance to the surrounding hills, invested in the project. And since the 1960's, the college's art history department has spawned a network of museum directors and curators, including the current director of the Guggenheim, Thomas Krens.</p>
        <p>Mr. Krens conceived of Mass MOCA while running a more traditional expansion of the college's Museum of Art, where he was director.</p>
        <p>In 1986, when Mr. Krens came looking for more display place, Mayor Barrett showed him the abandoned Sprague plant. It sprawled over a third of the town, with 27 buildings on 13 acres, and resembled  a walled medieval city, though in rough industrial brick, with a clock tower, courtyards and a branch of the Hoosic River flowing through it. The plant was built in 1874 for a thriving textile industry; when that went under in 1942, it was bought by Sprague, which made the trigger for the atomic bomb, components for the Gemini moon mission and electronic capacitors.</p>
        <p>Entranced, Mr. Krens spun a vision for a museum, involving a luxury hotel, the architect Frank Gehry and the collection of an Italian industrialist, Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo, who had more than 200 artworks from the 1960's and 1970's.</p>
        <p>Michael S. Dukakis, then the governor, bought into the idea as a development plan for this forlorn corner, which had been bypassed by the state's economic boom in the 1980's.  Mr. Krens estimated that the museum could be opened by 1990.</p>
        <p>But in 1988, Mr. Krens left for the Guggenheim, Mr. Gehry and the Italian count went with him.</p>
        <p>In a sense, the Guggenheim's much-hailed museum in Bilbao, Spain, is a flossier version of Mass MOCA, an effort to revive a faded Basque industrial city with a government-funded museum.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson, a protege of Mr. Krens, inherited the project, but by the next year the ''Massachusetts Miracle'' went bust. Mr. Dukakis was out by 1990, and the Republican administration of the new governor, William F. Weld, cut the $688,000 in development money that Mr. Dukakis had slipped in the budget.</p>
        <p>The Boston Globe sneered at the plan as ''endive economics'' and other newspapers were equally dismissive, calling it a pipe dream and a hare-brained scheme.</p>
        <p>But the sometimes puckish Mr.  Weld visited the old factory in the fall of 1992 and, like others, fell under the spell of its space, saying later that he liked its karma. After contemplating an exhibit displayed at the factory, a work by Mario Merz that resembled a spiral of mismatched tables set up for a hotel buffet, Mr. Weld gave the go-ahead for a gradual release of state funds.</p>
        <p>But there were more problems, and at one point even the Mayor Barrett said ''I'm all MOCA'd out.''</p>
        <p>The project was finally saved in 1994 when the Jacob's Pillow dance center became a sponsor, as required by legislation. This also changed the plan significantly, adding dance, movies and concerts by singer Patti Smith and others.</p>
        <p>Still, even after the years of struggle, the mayor is unable to stifle a giggle as he walks past the art that is saving his town.</p>
        <p>Like Joseph Beuys's ''Lightning With a Stag in its Glare'' which is owned by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, but is too big, at 3,000 pounds and 22 feet tall, to be shown there. It is a huge bronze triangle suspended from the ceiling with an aluminum sawhorse-looking thing and a bunch of little metal lumps.</p>
        <p>There is some difference of opinion about which is the lightning (Mr. Thompson says it is the big triangle), but it seems impossible to construe the lumps as anything but, well, deer droppings.</p>
        <p>''I can't keep a straight face,'' Mr. Barrett said. ''Droppings, hee, hee, hee. My citizens say they've got stuff like this in their basements.''</p>
