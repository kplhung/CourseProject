        <p>Two months after China's largest oil company staggered onto the stock market here, the country's second-largest telecommunications company announced today that it would seek to raise as much as $5.26 billion in an initial public offering in Hong Kong and New York.</p>

        <p>Two months after China's largest oil company staggered onto the stock market here, the country's second-largest telecommunications company announced today that it would seek to raise as much as $5.26 billion in an initial public offering in Hong Kong and New York.</p>
        <p>The company, China Unicom Ltd., hopes to get a warmer reception than PetroChina, a state-owned oil company that was tarred before its offering by charges of labor and human rights abuses. China Unicom will probably be spared those brickbats, analysts said, because it is an upstart phone company rather than a vast oil giant with operations as far apart as Tibet and the Sudan.</p>
        <p>''China Unicom is a very different animal than PetroChina,'' said Andrew Look, an independent fund manager here. ''PetroChina is a typical old-economy company. China Unicom doesn't have that baggage. It is a technology play, and a play on China's entry into the World Trade Organization.''</p>
        <p>But Unicom, which was started by the government six years ago to challenge the state monopoly, China Telecom, has its own problems. It recently shelved plans to upgrade its network with a mobile phone technology licensed from Qualcomm. And it has had to unravel joint ventures with more than 20 foreign partners, whose investments the Beijing authorities declared illegal.</p>
        <p>Most troubling, China Unicom has only a 14 percent share of the country's burgeoning cellular phone market. China Telecom, which raised $4.2 billion in a stock offering in 1997, has the bulk of the business -- plus the favor of market analysts, who consistently put its shares at the top of their recommended lists.</p>
        <p>''Unicom has yet to prove its mettle in the marketplace,'' said Rohit Sobti, an Asian telecommunications analyst at Salomon Smith Barney here, in a report published in February. ''We believe the company has a long way to go before it can effectively compete'' with China Telecom.</p>
        <p>China Unicom said in its prospectus that it would issue almost 2.46 billion shares, each at a price between 11.50 Hong Kong dollars, or $1.48, and 14.50 Hong Kong dollars, or $1.87. It will also offer 2.34 billion shares in the form of American depository receipts in a price range of $14.76 to $18.61.</p>
        <p>If the offering is fully subscribed at the middle of the price range, the company said, it would raise nearly $4 billion. At the top end of the range, the proceeds would be $5.26 billion -- making Unicom the largest stock offering in Asia outside Japan. The Japanese phone giant N.T.T. spun off its cellular operation, NTT DoCoMo, in an offering that raised $18 billion.</p>
        <p>Unicom said it planned to use the cash from the offering to underwrite a $12 billion expansion of its cellular, long-distance and data networks. Although the company is an also-ran in the mobile phone market, it operates the largest paging business in China, with 43.5 million subscribers.</p>
        <p>''The Chinese authorities have helped Unicom by giving it licenses and injecting the paging business,'' Mr. Look said. ''This is a very sexy story.''</p>
        <p>Certainly, China Unicom's story has had corporate soap opera qualities. In its early years, the company's status as an upstart was appealing to foreign investors like Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom. They agreed to put in money, even though it meant setting up awkward joint ventures to circumvent China's restrictions on foreign investment in telecommunications networks.</p>
        <p>Then, in 1998, Beijing declared these arm's-length investments illegal, and ordered the company to dissolve them. China Unicom spent many months in often-rancorous negotiations with the partners -- in the process becoming a symbol of the perils of foreign investment in the country.</p>
        <p>China Unicom said it would take a one-time charge of about $100 million to buy out the remainder of the joint ventures. As part of the settlement, it will also issue warrants that allow its former partners to buy shares of China Unicom six months after the initial public offering.</p>
        <p>The company's technology foray has been similarly ill-starred. In February, it signed an agreement with Qualcomm to upgrade its network with a digital mobile phone technology known as C.D.M.A., or code division multiple access. Today, it told investors in Hong Kong that it would abandon the plan because C.D.M.A. was in danger of being superseded in two years by so-called third-generation cellular technology.</p>
        <p>With this record of flip-flops and false starts, some analysts say that China Unicom is destined to be a weak sister to China Telecom. But Unicom can take solace from PetroChina: after being picketed by protesters and initially spurned by investors, it now trades comfortably above its offering price.</p>
