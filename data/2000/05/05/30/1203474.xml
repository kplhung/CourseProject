        <p>Edele Nielsen Holtz, who helped create the Clark Center for the Performing Arts in Manhattan and played an important role in Alvin Ailey's early career, died on May 20 at the Asheville Health Care Facility in Swannanoa, N.C. She was 82 and lived in Swannanoa.</p>
        <p>Ms. Holtz and her husband, Alwin, who died last year, became friends with Ailey in the early 1960's when a colleague of the young choreographer approached Ms. Holtz about rehearsal space at a new branch of the Young Women's Christian Association on Eighth Avenue and 53rd Street in Manhattan, where she was director of activities.</p>
        <p>Ms. Holtz, a peppery, no-nonsense social worker, agreed and eventually set up programs to benefit dancers, musicians and actors working in the theater district. Many of the programs, including a series of workshop performances for new choreographers, were suggested by Ailey. The performances were presented at Clark Center, a theater carved out of space that had been a hotel ballroom. The series provided crucial exposure for young choreographers who came of age artistically in the 1960's, 70's and 80's.</p>
        <p>Ms. Holtz and her husband came to New York after working in refugee and education programs in the Middle East for 10 years, beginning in 1948 as field staff members of the United Nations-Quaker Project for Palestinian Refugees in Gaza. The experience served them well in helping Ailey as much-needed surrogate parents and de facto booking agents and accountants in the tumultuous early days of Ailey's company.</p>
        <p>During her long career with the Y.W.C.A., Ms. Holtz was also the executive director of branches in Brooklyn and New Orleans and was a staff member of the group's national board.</p>
        <p>Ms. Holtz is survived by two sisters, Greta Rikard of Salem, Va., and Inga Hoffman of Santa Cruz, Calif.</p>
