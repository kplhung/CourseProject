        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The May 23 article depicts the sad state of affairs regarding the ''bitter medical debate over Lyme disease.'' Who would have thought back in the late 70's when Dr. Allen Steere described the clinical syndrome that we know today as Lyme disease that he would be the subject of complaints by patients who do not agree with his diagnoses.</p>
        <p>Increasingly, groups of patients (who may or may not have Lyme disease) are attempting to impose their will on governmental agencies charged with health care and research, and thus to subvert the scientific process. The ''bitter debate over Lyme disease'' is not that at all; it is a debate between science and ignorance, with science on the side of Dr. Steere.</p>
