        <p>In another sign that Glen Sather is closing in on a deal to join the Rangers, Wayne Gretzky, Sather's close confidant and longtime friend, said over the weekend that he had counseled Sather to take the Rangers' job.</p>
        <p>''I hope so,'' Gretzky said Sunday night on John Davidson's nationally syndicated radio show, Inside the N.H.L.''I've talked to Glen a couple of times. I've encouraged him to take on this challenge of being the guy in New York.''</p>
        <p>Last Friday night, Gretzky agreed to become a part owner of the Phoenix Coyotes. His participation in the Phoenix developer Steve Ellman's bid to purchase the Coyotes probably saved the franchise from moving to Portland, Ore.

        <p>Last Friday night, Gretzky agreed to become a part owner of the Phoenix Coyotes. His participation in the Phoenix developer Steve Ellman's bid to purchase the Coyotes probably saved the franchise from moving to Portland, Ore. But the Coyotes are expected to lose $11 million each of the next two seasons as they await the construction of a new arena. Sather, therefore, does not seem to be a fit in Phoenix.</p>
        <p>And even though Sather has said he has talked to teams other than the Rangers and the Coyotes, New York still seems to be the best fit.</p>
        <p>''I really think that it would be good for both,'' Gretzky said. ''New York needs a guy like Glen Sather. They need a guy with the reputation of being a champion, of being a winner.''</p>
        <p>In a telephone conversation yesterday, Sather again indicated that he would have been at the league's general managers' meeting in New York tomorrow if he were indeed a general manager by then. But because Maurice Richard's funeral is tomorrow in Montreal, the meeting has been postponed indefinitely. So, too, it appears, has Sather's official appointment by the Rangers, though they are believed to be extremely close to a deal.</p>
