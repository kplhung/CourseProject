        <p>The French commander of this volatile town, Gen. Pierre de Saqui de Sannes, told a visiting United Nations Security Council delegation recently that the place was calm.</p>
        <p>Minutes later, before the visitors had even left town, the first stones were thrown in a weekend of street violence that left six French soldiers and one United Nations police officer injured, several buildings burned and dozens of foreign cars damaged.</p>
        <p>It is the nature of Mitrovica, the last town in Kosovo with a significant presence of Serbs, to explode without warning, and no one knows better than the general. In February, on his second day in the job, the town exploded in the worst night of rioting that the NATO-led forces, known locally as KFOR, has seen since foreign troops arrived in Kosovo in June.</p>
        <p>Three months later, as he prepared to hand over the job to another French general, General de Saqui de Sannes conceded that the situation remained extremely delicate and that there was no guarantee against further violence.</p>
        <p>''I cannot stop another attack occurring in north Mitrovica,'' he said in an interview. ''There are a number of extremists on both sides. It could happen again.''</p>
        <p>Foreigners who are working here complain that despite 2,000 troops, including a contingent from the French Foreign Legion, and several hundred international police officers, the forces are still not in control of either the Albanian-dominated southern part of Mitrovica or its northern Serbian enclave.</p>
        <p>''KFOR and the U.N. have been unable to become the ruling power here,'' said a senior officer who works for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  ''They have never been the governing authority, except on paper.''</p>
        <p>Former members of the now disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army rule the Albanian side, and the Serbs are in charge in the north, the officer said, adding, ''There is a climate of complete impunity here that has to be changed.''</p>
        <p>Some changes have been instituted since the violence in February and March, with troop reinforcements arriving and the appointment of a retired American general, William Nash, as the new regional administrator. General Nash, who has experience as a peacekeeper in nearby Bosnia, has injected a certain dynamism into decision making.</p>
        <p>After the violence, he had a stream of people attend meetings in his office and reintroduced joint police and military patrols, a recognition of the poor cooperation that has existed.</p>
        <p>From the street, Mitrovica's divisions look uglier than ever. The boundaries between the Serbian northern district and the Albanian areas are now defined by coils of razor wire and sandbagged checkpoints. In the name of security, the troops have reinforced the divisions between the two.</p>
        <p>Some Albanians expelled in February have returned to a designated zone around the Ibar River, the waterway that divides the Serbian and Albanian districts. The Albanians returned under armed protection and now live behind armor and barbed wire.</p>
        <p>The United Nations high commissioner for refugees estimates that 60 percent of the estimated 2,000 who fled in February have not returned.</p>
        <p>Izet Jaha, 72, an Albanian, has French soldiers watching over him from an observation post in the house next door. ''While KFOR is up there,'' Mr. Jaha said, ''we can take our socks off while we sleep. If they were not here, none of us would be here.''</p>
        <p>The Serbs also feel insecure, distrustful of the peacekeepers and the United Nations, while fearing that a mass influx of Albanians into their district would force them to flee. Dusko Prodanovic, a Serbian bank manager who lives a block from the dividing line, said that the increased security was ''just a charade'' and that he saw little prospect for peace.</p>
        <p>''I think the Albanians hate us so much that they do not want to live with us,'' Mr. Prodanovic said.</p>
        <p>''The Americans are just waiting to expel us,'' said his wife, Bosanka.</p>
        <p>If the Albanians suffered more directly from the violence in February, the Serbs have lost out overall, said a member of the O.S.C.E. office here. ''The Serbs have lost a lot in these last three months,'' she said, adding that if the violence had been planned, it was a mistake.</p>
        <p>''They managed to expel a few hundred Albanians,'' the member said. ''But the reaction of the international community was very strong against them.''</p>
        <p>After trying to negotiate with the Serbs to return the Albanians and establish a safety zone, General de Saqui de Sannes did it by force. He also used force to push back from one bridge the Serbian thugs who keep watch on the river to deter Albanians from crossing to the northern side.</p>
        <p>''We showed that we will not accept partition, and the Albanians feel that,'' the general said. ''Now we must show that we will also not accept that Serbs be pushed out.''</p>
        <p>General Nash arrived last month with a mission to prevent the partition of the city and the northern Serb-dominated part of Kosovo. His goal has already shifted to returning the Serbs to Kosovo.</p>
        <p>''The issue we now face today is not partition, but the prosperous and safe return of Serbs to their homes.'' the general said in an interview.</p>
        <p>But violence simmers on. After the outburst on April 29 that followed the Security Council visit, one additional elderly Albanian couple was evicted from an apartment in northern Mitrovica. And the Serbian bridge watchers remain in charge on the main bridge, threatening Albanians and, sometimes, foreigners.</p>
        <p>The international forces have failed to arrest anyone for the killings in the riots in February and the damage on April 29. Police cells are full of petty criminals and drug addicts, but the general conceded that arresting the real troublemakers ''could spark a bigger problem.''</p>
        <p>The approach has raised questions about the determination of the French troops to enforce order. In the smaller Serbian enclave of Gracanica, by contrast, Swedish troops move in forcefully to arrest troublemakers immediately in commotions.</p>
        <p>A Swedish soldier recently shot one man in the leg to deter an attack, and several men have been expelled for three months, said a Swedish officer. ''You have to show them force,'' the officer said. ''Otherwise they don't stop.''</p>
