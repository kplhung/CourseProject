        <p>I just completed a book-related tour around the U.S., which left me feeling that a backlash may be brewing against all the technology hype now dominating our lives. If 1998 was the year of Internet hope, and 1999 the year of Internet hype, maybe 2000 will be the year of Internet reality. Here's my diary.</p>
        <p>Day 1: New York's 92nd Street Y. A young professional woman introduces herself something like this: ''Hi, my name is . . . and I work for a dot.com that's running out of money and about to go out of business.''</p>

        <p>I just completed a book-related tour around the U.S., which left me feeling that a backlash may be brewing against all the technology hype now dominating our lives. If 1998 was the year of Internet hope, and 1999 the year of Internet hype, maybe 2000 will be the year of Internet reality. Here's my diary.</p>
        <p>Day 1: New York's 92nd Street Y. A young professional woman introduces herself something like this: ''Hi, my name is . . . and I work for a dot.com that's running out of money and about to go out of business.''</p>
        <p>Day 2: Dinner at the Motorola Museum in Chicago. The conversation shifts to how sterile life can become when everything gets done on networks. A Motorola exec tells this story: She called her bank the other day to do some banking by phone. You know, press a few buttons and move your money around. But this time when she called her bank she got a real shock: a person answered.</p>
        <p>Yup, she said, a real live person. The bank's automated teller system was broken so they had to resort to the human variety -- those that that run on chocolate chips, not microchips. The woman described how much she savored the human interaction, and we all nodded knowingly.</p>
        <p>Day 5: Minneapolis. I am visiting hometown friends, Ken and Jill Greer, who own an ad agency that advertises its services on a Web site, Thinkgreer.com. Under photographic services, the Greers offered potential clients two choices of photography: ''Digital'' or ''Silver Halide.''</p>
        <p>''People would call us,'' Ken recalled, ''and say, 'I'm familiar with digital photography, but what is this new silver halide? What sort of technology is that?' You know, on the Internet everyone wants to be the first to discover something new, and they assumed that silver halide was this hot new technology.''</p>
        <p>Silver halide is just a fancy term for plain old film. But the name is so high-techy sounding that some people assumed it was the new, new thing, and they had to have it.</p>
        <p>Day 10: Las Vegas, the shopping center convention. My relatives are in the mall business, where everyone is worried about all the stories of the high-tech age, just around the corner, when you will be able to do all your shopping online from your Palm Pilot, and your refrigerator will automatically order more milk via the Web when its high-tech sensors indicate you're low. I jokingly suggested to the shopping center folks that they run an ad that would say: ''Imagine a world in which you will be able to go to just one place, walk from shop to shop, and see, touch, feel or try on anything you like, and then buy it right there and take it home with you -- without worrying about your credit card number being stolen, or how U.P.S. will deliver it, or how you will ship it back if it doesn't fit. Imagine such a world! It's also just around the corner -- right now. It's called a mall.''</p>
        <p>I believe in the possibilities of the new technologies as much as anyone. But it seems that while we started by surfing the Web, the Web is now surfing us. Technology is making life more complicated, not less, and we haven't found the balance yet.</p>
        <p>American Express has been running a TV ad showing a teenage girl at the kitchen table with her dad. The girl is working on her laptop and the father is paying bills by hand. The girl says to her dad: ''You're so analog!'' So the father asks: ''Analog? Is that good?'' The daughter says: ''Quaint.'' The father asks: ''Is quaint good?'' The daughter says: ''Sometimes.''</p>
        <p>More than sometimes. Walking through the casino in Las Vegas I was struck by all the shouting around the craps tables -- strangers high-fiving each other in victory and consoling each other in defeat. You can't do that gambling online alone in your basement. Las Vegas is thriving today precisely because it is such a tactile place, so full of people rubbing against people -- at shows, in casinos, in fantasy hotels and in giant swimming pools. Las Vegas is the future because it's the past.</p>
        <p>Day 11: I call my wife. She teaches fifth grade in a public school. She sounds tired. I ask what's new. She says she had to call some parents to come into school for special parent-teacher conferences before the school year ends. I think: Who is going to do that when education moves online?</p>
        <p>I recall another ad I saw along the way for a global phone company. It said: ''I phone, I fax, I surf at the same time -- because I can.''</p>
        <p>But who wants to?</p>
