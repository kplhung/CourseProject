        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a longtime public school classroom teacher, I must say that home schooling is not exclusive of public schooling (front page, May 24). I have seen some excellent results, especially when the adult in charge is a teacher or college graduate.</p>
        <p>I have taught many ''home-schooled'' students for the simple reason that parents who teach their children are aware of their limitations and seek public school foreign language teachers and math teachers as tutors.</p>
        <p>Many homeschoolers begin their public school education in the ninth grade. I welcome this small cohort of students who are, by and large, very polite and read above their grade level. I wish I could say that about even 30 percent of my high school students.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, if public schools are safe, clean and have high standards, then they have nothing to fear from competition from homeschoolers.</p>
