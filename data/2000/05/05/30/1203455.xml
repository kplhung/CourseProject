        <p>Pilgrimages  When the complete edition of Goethe's ''Italian Journey,'' recounting his travels in the late 1780's, was published in 1829, scores of German artists were inspired to make their own artistic pilgrimages to Rome.

Beginning today 40 paintings and drawings from 22 public and private collections in Germany will be assembled at the Dahesh Museum, 601 Fifth Avenue, at 48th Street, in an exploration of the vision and of these artists from 1829 to 1865.

        <p>Pilgrimages  When the complete edition of Goethe's ''Italian Journey,'' recounting his travels in the late 1780's, was published in 1829, scores of German artists were inspired to make their own artistic pilgrimages to Rome. Many were professors and students from Dusseldorf, where the Prussian Academy was a center of European art training and production. Beginning today 40 paintings and drawings from 22 public and private collections in Germany will be assembled at the Dahesh Museum, 601 Fifth Avenue, at 48th Street, in an exploration of the vision and of these artists from 1829 to 1865. ''In the Footsteps of Goethe: Paintings and Drawings From German Collections'' continues through Aug. 19.</p>
        <p>Russian Steps  In the year that the American colonies declared their independence from Great Britain, the Bolshoi Ballet was established in Russia. Through the centuries a bridge to the world beyond, the Bolshoi returns to the United States for the first time in more than a decade at 8 tonight to begin an American tour with an engagement through Sunday at the Kennedy Center Opera House in Washington. The opening attraction is ''Romeo and Juliet,'' with Nina Ananiashvili as Juliet and Andrey Uvarov as Romeo. Besides ''Romeo and Juliet,'' tomorrow and Saturday, the company will perform a new ''Don Quixote'' on Thursday, Friday and Sunday.</p>
        <p>Curtain Call  From ''True West'' come Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly. From ''The Music Man'' come Craig Bierko and Rebecca Luker. Two by two and one by one, as in the cases of Eartha Kitt from ''The Wild Party,'' Bernadette Peters from ''Annie Get Your Gun,'' Glenn Carter from ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' and Patrick Stewart from ''The Ride Down Mount Morgan,'' the stars are coming out to play. The time is 11:30 a.m. tomorrow. The place is Shubert Alley, west of Broadway between 44th and 45th Streets. The occasion is the annual ''Stars in the Alley'' free concert of the League of American Theaters and Producers, which includes music and dance numbers performed by over 60 cast members from Broadway's most popular musicals.</p>
        <p>Majestic Occasion  While Britain was losing its American colonies, George III was losing his mind. The London of his time and the madness of the monarch furnish the context for ''It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad King,'' the final concert of the 2000 season of the Eos Orchestra. At 8 p.m. on Thursdayat the Society for Ethical Culture Auditorium at 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, Jonathan Sheffer is to lead the ensemble in J. C. Bach's Overture to ''Orione'' and Haydn's Symphony No. 104, the ''London.'' The two works provide a framework for Peter Maxwell Davies's ''Eight Songs for a Mad King.'' Directed by Gregory Keller and featuring the baritone Dean Elzinga, the monodrama depicts the king's descent into a madness.</p>
