        <p>Navah Harlow, director of Center for Ethics in Medicine at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan, has created a system in which friends and relatives of a patient who is not competent and has not left a health-care proxy or living will can meet with her and tell her what they think or know the patient would have wanted; she can then present the case to an ethics panel; photo (M)</p>

        <p>What happens to people who have no health-care proxy or living will, and who wind up being kept alive by machines with little or no hope of recovery? In New York at least, for life support to be withdrawn, state law requires ''clear and convincing'' evidence that the patient would not want such treatment. That requirement can in effect punish people who never put their wishes into writing.</p>
        <p>But one hospital has made a special effort to help patients who lack written advance directives. Navah Harlow, director of the Center for Ethics in Medicine at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan, said, ''If a patient has told his loved ones what his wishes would be, and has lived life in a certain way so there is no doubt, can't we find a way to honor his wishes, to listen to his oral advance directive, as related by family and friends?''</p>

        <p>What happens to people who have no health-care proxy or living will, and who wind up being kept alive by machines with little or no hope of recovery? In New York at least, for life support to be withdrawn, state law requires ''clear and convincing'' evidence that the patient would not want such treatment. That requirement can in effect punish people who never put their wishes into writing.</p>
        <p>But one hospital has made a special effort to help patients who lack written advance directives. Navah Harlow, director of the Center for Ethics in Medicine at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan, said, ''If a patient has told his loved ones what his wishes would be, and has lived life in a certain way so there is no doubt, can't we find a way to honor his wishes, to listen to his oral advance directive, as related by family and friends?''</p>
        <p>She and others at the hospital have created a system in which friends and relatives can meet with her and tell her what they think or know the patient would have wanted. Then, the case is presented to an ethics panel.</p>
        <p>The process is not fast, and patients sometimes die before it can be completed. But, Ms. Harlow said, it is imperative to go slowly. ''I tell the families, 'Let's go through this process, because two or three months from now you'll be lying in bed, wondering if you acted too fast, and in the long run this will give you added piece of mind.' ''</p>
        <p>''I will then ask family members to write me a letter giving me clear and convincing evidence that this is what they know the patient would want. This is for the patient's wishes, not the family's wishes. We honor these oral advance directives. I have binders full of the most beautiful statements, from people of every level of education, in many different languages.''</p>
        <p>Last year, Patrick Bedford, a 67-year-old actor from Dublin who performed on Broadway and in films, was treated for cancer at Beth Israel and eventually was put on a respirator. Mr. Bedford had no living will or health care proxy, but at Ms. Harlow's suggestion, friends and relatives wrote letters on his behalf.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bedford had been an uproarious fellow, a singer and dancer and storyteller who loved to give parties.  One friend said that Mr. Bedford had declared he knew he had a tumor and wanted to die.</p>
        <p>''He told me he never wanted to be hooked up to any kind of machines,'' the friend wrote. ''Let him go to heaven to spin his tales and tell his stories, to be with all the other cast of partygoers the way he was meant to be and has not been for the last couple of weeks and will never be again.''</p>
        <p>Another wrote, ''We are certain that a man like Patrick would not want to be forced to live artificially.''</p>
        <p>''And we also want to respect his life,'' she continued, ''how he lived it and how he would like to have it end.''</p>
        <p>The letters were clear and convincing, Ms. Harlow said. But Mr. Bedford died before doctors could act on them.</p>
