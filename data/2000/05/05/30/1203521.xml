        <p>Unless action is taken now, gasoline prices will hit $2.25 a gallon this summer followed by a spike in heating oil costs worse than the one last winter, Senator Charles E. Schumer predicted yesterday. But federal energy officials disputed his figures.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer, a Democrat from New York, urged the Clinton administration to help drive prices down by releasing federal oil reserves into the market. He made his proposal in a joint letter dated Friday with Senator Susan M. Collins, a Republican from Maine, to the federal energy secretary, Bill Richardson.</p>
        <p>But Secretary Richardson disagreed with both the premise and the proposal. ''These are unnecessarily alarmist views, as they do not reflect current market conditions or projections,'' he said yesterday. His agency's experts forecast a national average price of $1.40 to $1.45 a gallon by the end of summer.</p>
        <p>The average price for regular unleaded gasoline in New York City is $1.64 a gallon, up from $1.27 a year ago, according to a recent survey by the AAA automobile association.</p>
        <p>The two senators blamed the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, charging that it had failed to keep its promise to increase production enough to hold crude oil prices to $28 a barrel. Instead, the price has been hovering around $30.</p>
        <p>''If OPEC continues to constrict supplies of oil and we fail to release reserves, the price of gasoline will go to $2 this summer and $2.25 by Labor Day, and home heating oil prices will be through the roof,'' Mr. Schumer said at a news conference in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Such increases would divert money from other needs and could curtail summer vacation plans, he said. Worse, increased fuel charges would raise the price of food and other commodities because of higher trucking costs. Such inflation could lead the Federal Reserve to push interest rates up, which would slow the economy. ''It points a dagger at the heart of our economy,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''Gasoline at $2.25 a gallon is not just a nuisance; it's a crisis.''</p>
        <p>The nation's oil reserve is about 600 million barrels stockpiled in Texas and Louisiana, set aside by law for emergencies.</p>
