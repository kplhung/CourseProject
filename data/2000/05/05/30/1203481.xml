        <p>Not far from the outlet where the Baikalsk Pulp and Paper mill discharges chlorine into the world's largest body of fresh water, Oleg Dolgov has dropped a line to fish.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists accuse the mill of polluting Lake Baikal, a mile-deep cleft in the Siberian earth that contains one-fifth of the planet's fresh water. But Mr. Dolgov, who has already caught a dozen small fish, shrugs off the danger of contamination. A cargo handler at the company store, he regularly eats what he catches, and he has never noticed ill effects.</p>
        <p>''The unemployed come down here all the time in the summer and catch fish with nets,'' Mr. Dolgov said.</p>
        <p>Locals may be insouciant, but among environmentalists in Russia and abroad, the Baikalsk Pulp and Paper mill symbolizes the abuse of an environmental treasure. An international campaign is seeking to close the plant, and Greenpeace is running television advertisements assailing the factory. But even as critics say the mill threatens this gem of a lake, management says the demands for a shutdown are blocking efforts to clean the plant up.</p>
        <p>The issue goes beyond the lake. Throughout the former Soviet Union, industry has turned waterways into environmental catastrophes.</p>
        <p>The city of Vladivostok pumps raw sewage into its bay; the Aral Sea has been gradually emptied and polluted by agricultural runoff; and the navy used to dump radioactive waste into the White Sea and the Sea of Japan.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists have long had trouble making their case in a nation predisposed to heavy industry. This time around, the Baikalsk mill is attempting to blame environmentalists themselves for the pollution.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, Greenpeace and all the environmental organizations prevent us from improving the environmental situation of the lake,'' said Anatoly Steinberg, president of Baikalsk Pulp and Paper, a joint stock company.</p>
        <p>Lake Baikal is 5,370 feet deep and contains 5,500 cubic miles of water. Believed to be 25 million years old, the lake floor's sediment is five miles deep, recording eons of life. Buried in its mud are traces of magnolia pollen, deposited when this northern lake had a subtropical climate.</p>
        <p>Today, Baikal is filled with rare species such as freshwater sponges and seals. Sixty percent of the lake's life forms are unique, biologists say.</p>
        <p>Its pure water and the region's virgin forests helped draw the Baikalsk mill here in the 1960's, a decision that critics see as a particularly unfortunate case of Soviet central planning.</p>
        <p>''Communist industrialists put a factory here because there is a lot of forest here,'' said Vladimir Fialkov, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences' Lake Baikal Museum. ''Then they passed a decree prohibiting cutting the woods around Baikal, to protect it. So they had to deliver timber from 1,000 kilometers away.''</p>
        <p>Baikalsk itself is a typical Siberian town -- rows of block apartments and neighborhoods of log houses with heaps of coal or wood in back. There is a monument to World War II veterans and a Soviet-era sculpture of youths reaching for the heavens, as if grasping for a socialist future. The air is permeated with the rotten-egg smell of pulp making.</p>
        <p>The plant produces 176,000 tons a year of high-quality pulp for domestic and foreign markets. Some of the chlorine, despite filtration, is discharged into the lake. Jennie Sutton, an Englishwoman who lives in Irkutsk not far away and is a leader of a local group, the Baikal Environmental Wave, said the chlorine is converted to deadly dioxins in the bodies of seals and other animals. And although the pollution is in a tiny part of the lake, the impact is disproportionate, she said. Animals flock to the warm outflow from the mill.</p>
        <p>''The actual management of the mill is irresponsible economically,'' Ms. Sutton said. ''They have found ways of hiding their profits to avoid paying for the damage they are doing.''</p>
        <p>After years of answering reporters' questions and watching environmentalists hang banners from his mill's smokestacks, Mr. Steinberg has little patience for the subject of pollution ''Why are foreigners so primitive?'' he pondered aloud in an interview. ''Why do they ask such stupid questions?''</p>
        <p>He insists that the mill causes a minute amount of harm that the vast lake is capable of handling. ''This is the best quality of water coming from any paper mill in the world,'' Mr. Steinberg said.</p>
        <p>Many scientists agree that the damage to Baikal has been minimal so far, and the pollution is restricted to a small portion of the south part of the lake.</p>
        <p>In any case, Mr. Steinberg says he has plans for reducing the pollution discharge to zero.</p>
        <p>Another lakeside mill in the town of Selenginsk, about 120 miles away, produces an inferior grade of paper in a plant that recycles waste water, so that, theoretically at least, it discharges nothing into the lake. The shareholders of the Baikalsk mill have decided that they will follow suit. They plan to convert the mill to producing a cheaper grade of pulp that does not require bleaching and will use a closed filtration system. Mr. Steinberg refuses to estimate the cost of remodeling or say where the money will come from.</p>
        <p>But he is bitter that environmentalists, rather than embracing this plan, are in his view blocking any solution short of shutting down the mill. ''Some critics,'' he asserted, ''have built entire careers around closing his plant. They are being parasites on the problem.''</p>
        <p>As the environmentalists see it, the plant's management simply cannot be trusted. They say that even mills with supposedly closed systems often discharge pollutants into the surrounding water.</p>
        <p>''The people responsible for checking independently are highly corruptible,'' Ms. Sutton said.</p>
        <p>Grigory Galazy, an environmentalist, retired biologist and former legislator in the regional parliament, says the mill is not needed. Downstream on the Angara River, which flows from Lake Baikal, two other pulp and paper mills could pick up the slack, he said, adding, ''While these two factories work at only 30, 40 percent of their capacity, this Baikalsk mill keeps stubbornly contaminating the lake.''</p>
        <p>Other scientists are divided on how serious the damage is. ''In 1989, there were massive deaths in the population of freshwater seals,'' said Nadezhda Basharova, a hydrobiology professor at Irkutsk State University. Autopsies showed that the seals were abnormally infested with parasites.</p>
        <p>Some scientists think that the seals were weakened by toxins from the mill and less able to resist the parasites, Ms. Basharova said.</p>
        <p>Still, she does not think that the mill should be closed. ''If you close it and go away,'' Ms. Basharova said, ''it will be worse for Baikal because there is a lot of contamination in the soil and it will find its way into the lake.''</p>
        <p>Environmental warnings carry little weight with many of Baikalsk Pulp and Paper Mills workers. Closing the mill would be devastating for the work force of 3,500 in a nation where the economy is deeply depressed.</p>
        <p>Baikal Environmental Wave is establishing a small business incubator to encourage alternative employment. The region, advocates say, could attract foreign hikers, boaters and hunters. But a program with a budget equivalent to a few thousand dollars would not have the resources to help a town full of people thrown out of work.</p>
        <p>''The factory was built at the same time as the town,'' said Mr. Dolgov, the fisherman. ''If there was no factory, there would be no jobs. It would be worse than any village could take. The town would die.''</p>
        <p>But others see hazards of another kind. ''The danger is that we could lose the uniqueness of Baikal,'' Mr. Galazy said. ''The loss will be irreparable. There is no other lake like this in the world.''</p>
