        <p>The huge lead had been wiped away midway through the fourth quarter and the cold-blooded scorers were rising out of the scrum on the Madison Square Garden floor. Reggie Miller and Jalen Rose were taking turns tightening the throats of the Garden crowd, and Larry Johnson, Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston were doing their best to hang on.</p>
        <p>And then the ball swung to Kurt Thomas on the left side of the lane, 14 feet from the basket. While the Indiana Pacers eyed the Knicks' scorers around the 3-point arc, trying to anticipate where the pass would go, Thomas eyed the basket through the din. With 5 minutes 12 seconds left in the game, Thomas lined up the shot and fired, believing the ball could not have been in better hands.</p>
        <p>''He always thinks he's a scorer, anyway,'' Marcus Camby said, joking afterward. ''He always talks about how he led the nation in scoring in college. He talks about it all the time. We can't get him to shut up about that.''</p>
        <p>The argument to shut Thomas up may be a tougher case today because that shot dropped, helping preserve a tenuous lead as the Knicks beat the Pacers, 91-89, to even the Eastern Conference finals at two games each. It gave Thomas a career playoff high of 16 points on 6-of-11 shooting. With Patrick Ewing out because of tendinitis in his right foot, Thomas was an offensive presence in the middle.</p>
        <p>When the shot dropped, Thomas danced down the court as the Pacers called a timeout, pumping his fist and smiling widely, a look far different from the usual. And the only shouting Thomas usually does is often followed by a technical foul as he struggles to contain his emotions after foul calls that pile up quicker than points on most nights.</p>
        <p>''I was just a little excited,'' he said, almost embarrassed, pointing out that he would hear it from his teammates at today's practice for being invited to the interview room. ''I was pumped up. I was just enjoying being out there on the floor.''</p>
        <p>Thomas does have the scoring ability, showcased during his days at Texas Christian, and a proven toughness. But last night he also displayed skills that have rarely been exhibited. Thomas did what he could to counter the 7-foot-4-inch Rik Smits, outscoring him, 16-13, and outrebounding him, 6-1.</p>
        <p>''Kurt did a good job giving us some additional points that we obviously needed today,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ''He got on the board, defended Smits as well as you can at 6-foot-8. And I thought he just played a really, really good game.''</p>
        <p>It was Chris Dudley, however, who got the start again. Dudley provided stable defense in Game 3 on Saturday, but last night he was quickly saddled with fouls: five in eight minutes. So, Thomas, who has grumbled to Van Gundy about playing time during the postseason, found himself on the floor for 35 minutes.</p>
        <p>He had not played more than 16 minutes in the first two rounds of the playoffs and played just 13 minutes in Game 1 of this series. But when Ewing went down with an injury in Game 2, Thomas played 28 minutes and scored 10 points on 5-of-6 shooting. He went 27 minutes in Game 3, and found himself last night as much of a focus as any Knick.</p>
        <p>''This was one of the biggest, I would say,'' Thomas said of his performance. ''I don't really think about games, certain games. I just go out there and play and just contribute and hope that my team comes out with the win.''</p>
        <p>Thomas said he had confidence in the Knicks' bench. ''We know that we have guys who can step their game up,'' he said. ''When the opportunity is there, when Jeff calls our number, we are ready.''</p>
        <p>Van Gundy said: ''I think he went through a period of adjustment when he wasn't playing as much. I thought going into Game 7 at Miami, he came in with a better mental approach to that game and has carried on forward from there. I think he is doing a really good job.''</p>
        <p>Thomas said his baskets resulted from the double-teams that scrambled toward Johnson and the other Knicks. But his teammates congratulated Thomas for his play.</p>
        <p>''They were all saying, 'Great job, great job, Kurt,' '' he said. ''That is what we do after every game, just congratulate each player on the things that they did out there on the floor.</p>
        <p>''I am ready every game. I prepare as if I am going to play 30 minutes, and if I play only six, I just have to keep my head up and keep playing. I'm not amazed at what we did. I know the character of this team and how hard we prepare for every game. No matter what the situation is, we know we can come out on top.''</p>
