        <p>The Vision Festival, New York's annual mixed-media display of jazz's bohemian tendencies, is a model of a self-sustaining subcultural event that draws consistent crowds, an undertaking of fairly major size (11 nights of seven-hour shows) without corporate sponsorship. It is remarkable in that this isn't necessarily a youth-movement event. The festival draws a post-collegiate to late-middle-aged crowd and has its aesthetic roots in art movements of the 1960's and 70's.</p>
        <p>This year's festival, mixing music, dance and visual art, took place at the New Age Cabaret, former site of the rock club Electric Circus. It's the best space the festival has found yet, and the first with a raked auditorium. Sunday night's lineup had some pleasant surprises amid self-indulgent moments, but the full crowd's constant effusion of enthusiasm was the sort of ''my music,  right or wrong'' spirit that you don't often witness in this city.</p>

        <p>The Vision Festival, New York's annual mixed-media display of jazz's bohemian tendencies, is a model of a self-sustaining subcultural event that draws consistent crowds, an undertaking of fairly major size (11 nights of seven-hour shows) without corporate sponsorship. It is remarkable in that this isn't necessarily a youth-movement event. The festival draws a post-collegiate to late-middle-aged crowd and has its aesthetic roots in art movements of the 1960's and 70's.</p>
        <p>This year's festival, mixing music, dance and visual art, took place at the New Age Cabaret, former site of the rock club Electric Circus. It's the best space the festival has found yet, and the first with a raked auditorium. Sunday night's lineup had some pleasant surprises amid self-indulgent moments, but the full crowd's constant effusion of enthusiasm was the sort of ''my music,  right or wrong'' spirit that you don't often witness in this city.</p>
        <p>In New York, acceptance of out-jazz, or the experimental jazz fringe, has always had a political element, the notion that it is a music of willed resistance against all dominant orthodoxies. Heroes of the movement stay heroes, whatever the state of their musical gifts.</p>
        <p>Early on Sunday, the 10th day of the festival, DJ Spooky, with a laptop, turntables and double-bass, and Matthew Shipp, on piano, played one of the evening's more curious shows. Curious because electro-acoustic improvisation, growing fashionable quickly among experimental musicians around the world, has only started to make a dent in this corner of the improvisation world.</p>
        <p>And where the tendency in this kind of performance is often to shed one's instrumental language and work with the computer's possibilities as a sound manipulator, both players stayed firmly within their own styles. Mr. Shipp used wide, dark chords in staccato rhythms, quoting from Thelonious Monk and Dave Brubeck and frequently lapsing into ''Greensleeves,'' a piece he has recently recorded, playing it absolutely stiff and straight.</p>
        <p>DJ Spooky used his computer only sporadically, tapping his bass to get droning sounds, splicing bits of drum-and-bass records and during one particularly good stretch panning between two turntables with a bebop drum solo playing on each.</p>
        <p>William Parker's Little Huey Creative Music Orchestra, a 15-piece band that brings together many of the out-jazz scene's moving parts -- players like the saxophonists Rob Brown and Ori Kaplan, the trumpeter Roy Campbell, and the trombonist Alex Lodico -- performed a good set that went on too long. ''Kaleidoscope,'' the long piece it performed (one of two pieces commissioned this year by the festival's nonprofit organizing outfit, Arts for Art), sounds like much of the band's other music. Over the rhythm section's fluctuating patterns, which Mr. Parker guided with strong, thick bass notes, saxophones on one side and brass on the other read from charts.</p>
        <p>The music meandered through full-ensemble passages that sounded like continents shifting past one another; once in a while the band spat out blaring, percussive single notes. At times it recalled Charles Mingus at his wildest, especially in Mr. Parker's connection with his drummer, Andrew Barker. Unfortunately most players were given a turn to solo, and finally there was a sense of interesting formal ideas toyed with but prematurely abandoned.</p>
        <p>At the end of the night the guitarist James Blood Ulmer appeared with a reunited version of his Music Revelation Ensemble, a band he recorded with a decade ago, including the tenor saxophonist David Murray. Over steady-boil drum rhythms and only a loosely defined pulse, Mr. Ulmer played his electric guitar with his fingers, double-stopping and bending notes like a mixture of old acoustic blues and Indian music. It was mysterious, powerful music. In each piece he established a grounding drone with the bassist Calvin Jones; Mr. Murray played along for the themes, and then roamed freely in the wide-open structure of the tunes, flying up into virtuosic high-register trills.</p>
