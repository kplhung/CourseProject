        <p>GRUNBERG-Emanuel (Lica), the love of my life, my husband God gave me for 55 years has left me on May 28, 2000. Evelyne (Evy) nee Wechsler. Born in Roumania, he was, during the difficult years of war, a pillar of the Jewish community-their pride. Not allowed to practice the law he had studied, he went into the educational field. At the Moria Gaster School where he was principal, he was instrumental in establishing the ''Micul (Little) Gulliver'' Children's Theatre, writing and directing plays that brought so much to young and old. They all respected and loved him dearly for the gift he gave them when they needed a smile on their sad faces. He left for Israel in 1949, where his talent as a playwright and stage director was appreciated when he joined the Li-La-Lo and Do-Re-Mi Theatres. He also published his poetry in the Roumanian newspaper ''Viata Noastra.'' They were pearls of wisdom. In 1967, he came to the United States. His love for books made him choose the career of editor with the Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Division Academic Press, publisher of scientific books, where he worked for 20 years. He was a remarkable human being. His wit, his humor, his sensibility, his integrity, his modesty were unique. The Wechsler, Kastner, Kimmel, Cherches, Finkelstein, Nagler, Auer and Sebastian families and his many friends in Israel, France and Brazil mourn his passing. Services Wednesday 11:30AM at ''The Riverside,'' 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.</p>
