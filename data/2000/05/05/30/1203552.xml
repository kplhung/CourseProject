        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I have had disabling health problems for many years and wasted thousands of dollars and years of my life on pointless medical and psychiatric testing and treatment.  Only recently did anyone bother to test me for Lyme disease (''Questioning Long-Term Lyme Cases,'' May 23). I tested positive.</p>
        <p>I am profoundly disturbed by the predominant medical attitudes about Lyme disease. Suppose a man is exposed to tuberculosis. He contracts TB and it is diagnosed. After a course of treatment, his symptoms remain. Would any doctor then tell him that he no longer had tuberculosis simply because he had already been given antibiotics? Of course not! Only with Lyme infections does this sort of irrational thinking prevail. Why aren't more doctors lobbying for a completely accurate test and a truly effective cure?</p>
