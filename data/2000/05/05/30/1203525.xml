        <p>As WorldCom Inc. continues to negotiate for the Justice Department's approval for the company's pending $115 billion acquisition of the Sprint Corporation, people close to the talks said in recent days that the discussions could lead to the sale of the Sprint brand and its long-distance service.</p>
        <p>Key members of the Justice Department team reviewing the merger plan have said privately that components of the deal, particularly in the long-distance telephone business, may violate antitrust laws. But it is unlikely that those concerns will derail the entire transaction. Instead, Washington is expected to require that parts of Sprint be sold to outside companies as a condition for the merger's approval.</p>
        <p>But, like Br'er Rabbit being thrown into the briar patch, there is a distinct possibility that at least some of the Sprint units the government wants to be spun off are those that WorldCom was least interested in acquiring, anyway. And any compromise acceptable to WorldCom is certain to include what it most desires: Sprint's nationwide wireless operation.</p>
        <p>Last week, Bernard J. Ebbers, chief executive of WorldCom, and William T. Esrey, his counterpart at Sprint, met Joel I. Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, and talks are expected to continue into June.</p>
        <p>It has been clear since the WorldCom-Sprint deal was announced last year that WorldCom -- already the No. 1 Internet carrier around the globe -- would not be allowed to acquire Sprint's Internet business. That may be somewhat disappointing for WorldCom, but it certainly will not come as any surprise.</p>
        <p>The plans of the regulators and of WorldCom's executives may diverge, however, regarding just what is meant by ''Sprint's Internet business.'' And that should be no surprise, either. Indeed, after WorldCom agreed to acquire MCI in 1999, regulators required that MCI's Internet business be spun off. But in the eyes of at least some communications experts, that spin-off was as flawed in its execution as it was noble in its intent.</p>
        <p>What happened? Regulators allowed WorldCom to sell MCI's Internet customers and Internet switches to Cable &amp; Wireless of Britain, but did not require that the deal transfer ownership of any long-distance fiber optic communications network. So while Cable &amp; Wireless acquired a big business, it found it difficult to generate profits from that operation because it still had to buy long-haul communications capacity from MCI WorldCom.</p>
        <p>Regulators are not likely to let themselves be outfoxed in the same way again. That's why it would be a surprise if the sale of Sprint's Internet operation did not include at least some fiber optic assets.</p>
        <p>And that will not go over nearly as well with WorldCom's executives.</p>
        <p>Ever since acquiring the Wiltel fiber optic network in 1995, Mr. Ebbers has recognized that sustainable profits in the telecommunications industry rest on ownership of physical assets, and he will be loathe to give up any of Sprint's.</p>
        <p>The same dynamic -- with WorldCom far more willing to give up customers than network assets -- may very well come into play regarding Sprint's long-distance telephone business as well.</p>
        <p>Some people at the Justice Department appear concerned that a combined WorldCom-Sprint would control too much of the long-distance telephone industry. If the department simply asks WorldCom to sell off Sprint's consumer long-distance unit, the response will probably be clear: no problem.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ebbers and other members of his team have never been enamored of the consumer long-distance market. As far as they are concerned, it is a low-margin, high-cost sector best left to others, like AT&amp;T and, perhaps in the future, the Bell companies. As long as regulators do not ask WorldCom to sell some of Sprint's fiber optic network to go along with them, WorldCom would probably have no problem selling Sprint's millions of residential long-distance customers to another telecommunications company.</p>
        <p>As part of that discussion, Justice Department regulators have been expressing concern about WorldCom's control of the Sprint brand, say people close to the negotiations. There too, it appears that WorldCom would not protest too much. After all, WorldCom has already stripped the MCI name from the combined company's formal identity.</p>
        <p>Far thornier than the fate of Sprint's consumer long-distance business, however, will be the disposition of Sprint's unit that sells long-distance phone service to business customers. The regulators may well ask WorldCom to sell big parts of that operation as well, but at that point WorldCom is likely to throw up a whole host of arguments.</p>
        <p>The long-distance phone business, WorldCom executives have reasoned, is quickly becoming merely one indivisible component of a larger basket of communications services that the company sells to business customers. The most likely argument goes something like this: If WorldCom is using a unified network to sell advanced data services in an integrated bundle along with voice communications and advanced functions to tie corporate locations together, how can it be expected to peel out the voice segment?</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, it could be done, analysts say, but it would not be easy. And it remains unclear just how far down that road the Justice Department is prepared to go.</p>
        <p>For all of the concessions that WorldCom will have to make, none are likely to tarnish the deal's crown jewel: Sprint's wireless operation. If Sprint did not own a nationwide wireless telephone network, the acquisition would have never been struck.</p>
        <p>WorldCom and Sprint may run into some minor opposition regarding the combined companies' extensive holdings of wireless licenses used for transmitting data to fixed locations. But WorldCom never had a mobile phone business and so the cellular component of the deal is not likely to face any serious hurdles.</p>
        <p>And for Mr. Ebbers, that appears to be the most important thing.</p>
