        <p>After Stanley Leibman was arrested last year on federal bank fraud charges, he was so distraught, the government said, that he called an old pal, Vincent Scarabino, to complain about his lot.</p>
        <p>As federal prosecutors described the conversation, Mr. Leibman, who once owned a string of Brooklyn electronics stores, told Mr. Scarabino that he had been caught floating thousands of dollars in bad checks through a bank in downtown Brooklyn. Mr. Leibman, the prosecutors said, went on to explain that he was deathly afraid that his partner in the criminal scheme had cut a deal with the government and would testify at his trial.</p>
        <p>In early January, court documents showed, Mr. Scarabino, a former deputy director at the Brooklyn office of the United States Small Business Administration, listened attentively to his friend's nervous ramblings from his winter home in Spring Hill, Fla., north of Tampa. But toward the end of the month, the government said, Mr. Scarabino crossed the line between comradeship and criminality by proposing a radical solution to Mr. Leibman's woes: have the former business partner and potential witness killed by a pair of seasoned murderers for hire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scarabino, 60, is to go on trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn this morning on charges of trying to arrange the killing of Mr. Leibman's former partner, Davinder Bakshi. Mr. Scarabino has denied the charges and has asserted in court that he is a legally blind diabetic who can barely dress himself, let alone concoct a murder plot.</p>
        <p>The trial, which is scheduled to open with jury selection today, promises to permit at least a peek into central Florida's criminal underbelly. After all, Mr. Scarabino was caught on tape, the government said, telling Mr. Leibman that the primary hit man contracted for the job was an old pro who already had ''a couple of notches in his belt.''</p>
        <p>Michele Adelman, the assistant United States attorney who is trying the case, said Mr. Scarabino met Mr. Leibman and Mr. Bakshi through the Small Business Administration in 1985 or 1986, when the two entrepreneurs were looking to expand their string of electronics emporiums. Over the course of nearly a decade, Mr. Scarabino helped the men get agency loans of more than $300,000, she said.</p>
        <p>But by September 1998, the business dealings that once connected the three had soured to the point at which Mr. Scarabino and Mr. Bakshi had an irreconcilable falling out, Ms. Adelman said. By the next year, she added, the two men broke off all contact, even though Mr. Bakshi still owed Mr. Scarabino and the agency $50,000.</p>
        <p>Despite the argument with Mr. Bakshi, Mr. Scarabino and Mr. Leibman remained close friends, the government said. They harbored a lingering ill will toward Mr. Bakshi, whose name figured prominently in their discussions, particularly after Mr. Leibman's bank fraud arrest.</p>
        <p>A Federal Bureau of Investigation affidavit summarizing the case says  Mr. Leibman and Mr. Scarabino saw Mr. Bakshi as both an annoyance and a threat. Mr. Leibman, the affidavit says, feared that Mr. Bakshi's testimony might be enough to send him to prison. Mr. Scarabino, it suggests, was still perturbed that Mr. Bakshi had never repaid his loans.</p>
        <p>The government asserts that a criminal plot was born from this mutual antipathy. At the time the plot was supposedly hatched, Mr. Leibman was the beneficiary of a $500,000 life insurance policy in Mr. Bakshi's name and, the authorities say, planned to use the insurance money to pay Mr. Scarabino for the murder after their victim's death.</p>
        <p>But the plot was foiled when Mr. Leibman was arrested for cheating the Atlantic Liberty Bank last April and agreed to help the government build a case against Mr. Scarabino. Joining forces with federal agents, Mr. Leibman taped a series of telephone conversations in which Mr. Scarabino is heard discussing some of the details of their plan.</p>
        <p>The agents contend that Mr. Leibman called Mr. Scarabino on Jan. 5 to tell him to ''call off Bobby and Joey,'' the killers for hire, because his trial had been pushed back. But, according to the government, Mr. Scarabino shrugged off his friend's concerns and told him that he ''should go through with it.''</p>
        <p>About two weeks later, court documents say, Mr. Scarabino was caught on tape telling Mr. Leibman that he had spoken to ''an old friend'' about the ''predicament'' and that this friend was ''the guy you've been looking for.''</p>
        <p>The documents go on to say that Mr. Scarabino then told Mr. Leibman that his friend would ''make it look good,'' just ''like a robbery.''</p>
        <p>On the basis of these taped conversations, Mr. Scarabino was arrested in Florida by the F.B.I. in February. When he appeared before a judge in federal court in Tampa, he said he was not a killer but an old man, suffering from blindness and disease, who depended on his wife to dress him every morning.</p>
        <p>''I am legally blind,'' he told Magistrate Thomas B. McCoun. ''God bless my wife. She does everything for me.''</p>
