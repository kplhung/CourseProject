        <p>The Board of Education plans to allow each of the city's local school districts to decide whether to open its summer school program to students from private and parochial schools or to public-school students who want extra instruction, Harold O. Levy, the interim schools chancellor, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>In outlining the board's plans for its huge summer program, Mr. Levy said roughly 19,400 teachers had applied for summer jobs, enough to provide enough teachers and classrooms for virtually any student who wanted to attend.</p>

        <p>The Board of Education plans to allow each of the city's local school districts to decide whether to open its summer school program to students from private and parochial schools or to public-school students who want extra instruction, Harold O. Levy, the interim schools chancellor, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>In outlining the board's plans for its huge summer program, Mr. Levy said roughly 19,400 teachers had applied for summer jobs, enough to provide enough teachers and classrooms for virtually any student who wanted to attend.</p>
        <p>But he said he would leave to district superintendents the decision whether to allow the enrollment of the extra students, who have been permitted to attend in previous years, or to use the extra teachers to reduce class sizes for the six-week summer program. Mr. Levy said he believed a majority of the districts would offer expanded programs, but he did not identify which ones intended to do so.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy also said he would ask the board for authorization to petition the State Legislature to change the education law and make summer school mandatory for the 250,000 students at risk of failing.</p>
        <p>Summer school is not currently covered by the state's compulsory school attendance law. Last year, only 55 percent of the 26,676 students who did not meet promotion standards in grades three, six and eight attended summer school.</p>
        <p>This year's mandatory summer program is expected to be 10 times the size of last year's, because the required attendance is being expanded from those three grades to all students, from third grade up, at risk of failing.</p>
        <p>Final decisions on which students will be required to attend summer school will be made no later than June 9, Mr. Levy said.</p>
        <p>Students still face the possibility of being taught this summer by uncertified teachers, who make up 25 percent of the current city teachers who have applied for summer jobs.</p>
        <p>Although 1,000 teachers from other districts have also applied for summer jobs in New York City, the board's contract with the teachers' union requires that uncertified teachers who work in the system be hired before anyone from outside districts, even if those applicants are certified.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy has been criticized by some board members in recent weeks for not yet producing his summer school plans, which he said were delayed because of a dispute between City Hall and the teachers' union over how summer teachers would be compensated.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Levy's detailed management plan received a mixed reception from board members. Three members, Irving S. Hamer, Ninfa Segarra and Irene H. Impellizzeri, gave critical assessments, saying the plan lacked necessary details.</p>
        <p>But Terri Thomson, the Queens board member, complimented the plan, saying it was ''great to see that all of the things that bothered us last year are being addressed early on.''</p>
