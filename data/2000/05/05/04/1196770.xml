        <p>Representatives of the heavy-metal band Metallica went yesterday to the headquarters of Napster Inc. with 13 boxes of papers said to list more than 300,000 computer users who, without the band's permission, had recently downloaded Metallica music from other users listed on Napster's Internet site.</p>
        <p>Repeating statements made by band members Tuesday during an interview broadcast over the Internet, Howard King, the band's lawyer, said the band did not intend to bring any of the computer users into its previously filed lawsuit against Napster for copyright infringement. He said that the names had been gathered and submitted to Napster after the company said it could not do anything to stop the free trade in Metallica songs without specific information about which Napster Web site users were involved.</p>

        <p>Napster, through a lawyer, said yesterday that it would review the papers and take steps to disable those users Metallica identified if the claims had been properly submitted. The statement, issued by Laurence Pulgram, a San Franciso lawyer, went on to say that the result might be to force it to knock the users off its site.</p>
        <p>Napster, which is based in San Mateo, Calif., functions as a meeting place for computer users willing to share their music files over the Net.</p>
