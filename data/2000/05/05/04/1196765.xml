        <p>A top Consolidated Edison official said today that the radioactive leak at the Indian Point 2 nuclear plant in February might have been avoided if the plant's most recent inspection had employed the kind of advanced technology that was available but not yet widely used by the industry.</p>
        <p>Speaking at a meeting of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in suburban Washington, James S. Baumstark, a vice president of engineering for Con Edison, offered the fullest account to date as to why a corroded tube in one of the plant's steam generators cracked on Feb. 15, allowing radioactive water to mix with clean water and forcing the utility to shut the plant down.</p>
        <p>In particular, Mr. Baumstark spoke about the plant's 1997 inspection, which the regulatory commission recently criticized as too lax. While he insisted that the utility had used the best technology then available to inspect the steam-generator tubes, he acknowledged that it had failed to spot structural flaws that would have been detected had more sophisticated technology been used.</p>
        <p>As a result, Mr. Baumstark said, the Feb. 15 incident ''most likely would have been preventable'' had the utility been using such sophisticated technology, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which recorded the meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baumstark's comments expanded on a Con Edison report issued this week in which the utility concluded that the ''principal cause of the leakage was the inability to detect the indication'' in 1997.</p>
        <p>It will take at least a few weeks, said Neil Sheehan, a commission spokesman, to determine if the generators should be replaced, and when -- or even if -- Indian Point 2 can reopen. Con Edison has said that replacement would cost $100 million and result in long delays.</p>
