        <p>As word spread late last night that Cardinal John O'Connor's protracted struggle with brain cancer had ended in his death, New Yorkers bid silent farewells to the controversial, ever visible archbishop, whose months of suffering had made them pray for his passing.</p>
        <p>Though Cardinal O'Connor's life in his 16 years as head of the New York archdiocese was often marked by division and the drawing of battle lines, in his death, both adversaries and allies stood together in recognizing the worth of a man who defied easy categories.</p>
        <p>Speaking in front of Gracie Mansion last night, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who received a diagnosed of prostate cancer days ago, spoke of Cardinal O'Connor as a ''moral compass'' and ''a man of principle to whom the city is very much in debt.''</p>
        <p>''The city lost a special friend, a very special religious leader, and I lost a friend, someone that I felt would always give you straight and honest advice and would give it in a charitable and loving way,'' Mr. Giuliani said.</p>
        <p>In a written statement, the mayor's opponent in the race for New York's Senate seat, Hillary Rodham Clinton, called Cardinal O'Connor's death ''a great loss'' not only for the archdiocese, but for ''millions of Americans who looked to him for religious and moral guidance.''</p>
        <p>Though the cardinal joined conservatives in opposing abortion and gay rights, he also fought against the death penalty. He was a forceful advocate for the disabled and the poor, and personally intervened to help settle labor disputes by pressing for workers' rights.</p>
        <p>Kevin Finnegan, a gay activist who is also involved in labor issues, said that despite his disagreement with the cardinal on matters of gay rights, he had ''seen the church reach out to disenfranchised communities and be very Catholic and do good things'' under the cardinal.</p>
        <p>Though he was, strictly speaking, leader of a diocese that covered Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island, along with seven counties north of the city, Cardinal O'Connor's influence reached throughout the country, as the most visible spokesman for the Vatican in the United States.</p>
        <p>Word that Cardinal O'Connor had died came from Joseph Zwilling, who served as the cardinal's spokesman  throughout his tenure as archbishop of New York. In an emotional news conference, Mr. Zwilling said that Cardinal O'Connor ''has completed his earthly journey and gone home to God.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zwilling said the cardinal had received last rites, known as the sacrament of the sick, several times throughout his illness, most recently last Saturday.</p>
        <p>The cardinal, spiritual leader of 2.4 million Catholics in the New York area, had waged a largely private battle through brain surgery followed by radiation, disappearing from public view over the last 10 weeks, as his illness -- which he never named -- claimed the last of his vitality.</p>
        <p>It was only after his death that the word cancer was used, as Mr. Zwilling explained the cause of death.</p>
        <p>He said the cardinal, who lost consciousness in the afternoon, had not been in any pain. Cardinal O'Connor's sister and other family members were at his side, as were the priests who lived with him and a few close friends.</p>
        <p>Though New Yorkers had been expecting the news, particularly after an afternoon news conference in which the archdiocese announced that Cardinal O'Connor stood ''at the hour of his death,'' last night's confirmation transformed their prayers into grief.</p>
        <p>''It's like losing a member of your family,'' said Father John Flynn, pastor of St. Martin of Tours parish in the Crotona section of the Bronx. Father Flynn said he felt the archbishop's passing personally.</p>
        <p>Father Flynn said the cardinal was instrumental in helping him start a program for youngsters in his parish called Save a Generation.</p>
        <p>''When I wrote and told him that I was sorry that he was sick, he wrote back saying, 'More good than you'll ever know will be accomplished by that work that you're doing,' '' Father Flynn recalled. ''He was always thinking of other people.''</p>
        <p>Former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who wrote a book with Cardinal O'Connor called ''Hizzoner and His Eminence,'' called Cardinal O'Connor ''an extraordinary man who was perceived by everyone as the number one clerical figure in the city, irrespective of faith.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Koch, who, like the cardinal, seldom shrank from a good confrontation, praised the cardinal's work to mend ties between the Catholic church and the Jewish people. He said the cardinal had once told him that ''one of his major goals was to have the Vatican recognize diplomatically the state of Israel, and there is no doubt in my mind that the pope was moved to do that by the cardinal's intercession.''</p>
        <p>Kevin Lynch, the director of organizing for District 15 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said that the cardinal had been instrumental in the union's efforts last year to organize the livery drivers who serve downtown financial firms.</p>
        <p>''He sort of adopted those guys,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''He contacted people on Wall Street when we wanted to get some of the big financial houses to start using union drivers. It helped turn around this campaign.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynch said he attended a fund-raising dinner for Catholic Charities at which the cardinal made it clear where his sympathies were.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'I told the pope there was only two requirements for the guy who replaces me. One is he has to be a Catholic; two is he has to be a union guy.' For him, it was a moral thing.''</p>
        <p>Father Gerald Walsh, a former private secretary to the cardinal who is now pastor at St. Elizabeth's parish in Washington Heights, called his death ''very, very sad,'' adding, ''He's a presence in the city that's not easy to replace.''</p>
