        <p>In his first town hall meeting upstate, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said today that he would, if elected senator, support Jesse Helms as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but that he would not share a ballot with Patrick Buchanan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said his support of Mr. Helms reflected his belief that Republicans should broaden their party to different points of view. That would make it ''much healthier than a party dominated by one part.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani is running as a moderate Republican, and Mr. Helms is ardently conservative, opposed to abortion and equal rights for gay people.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Giuliani, who is seeking the endorsement of the state's fractious Independence Party in his campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton for United States Senate, also said he would not accept the endorsement if the party put Mr. Buchanan on its ticket for president.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I could do that, but I'm hoping they don't do that,'' Mr. Giuliani said.</p>
        <p>The mayor was interviewed by Chris Matthews, the host of MSNBC's cable program, ''Hardball,'' at the Rochester Institute of Technology here. More than 500 students attended the event, which was telecast live. Mr. Matthews and the students asked questions on topics as diverse as Elian Gonzalez, police brutality and AIDS.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Matthews sat in straight-back chairs, surrounded by students as Mr. Giuliani's media consultant, Adam Goodman, recorded the scene on film.</p>
        <p>One student asked the mayor if he thought he had a good chance of winning the Senate race, even if ''you have a reputation of supporting police brutality.'' Mr. Giuliani, referring to the Amadou Diallo shooting, responded that: ''It was a terrible thing that happened. It was a great tragedy.'' But he added that a racially mixed jury had found the police officers not guilty and that the police were more restrained in New York than in other cities. ''You just don't know that because the media doesn't cover that,'' the mayor said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani appeared relaxed throughout the hourlong program even as Mr. Matthews and some other students sometimes questioned him aggressively. Afterward his campaign aides sought out reporters to impress on them their view of the mayor's steadiness under pressure.</p>
        <p>''We think that Mrs. Clinton would never allow herself to get in this environment,'' said Juleanna Glover Weiss, the mayor's campaign press secretary. ''It's free flowing, it's thoughtful, it's completely unpredictable.''</p>
        <p>The mayor said tonight that he ''very much'' wanted to run for the Senate -- ''I'm looking forward to it,'' he said -- despite his recent discovery that he has prostate cancer. He added, ''My whole hope and intention is to do it. I'd be very disappointed if I didn't.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Matthews also presented the mayor with quotes from a now-well-known paper that Mr. Giuliani wrote as a student at Manhattan College, in which he said that objections to Robert F. Kennedy's running for Senate from New York as a carpetbagger were ''truly ridiculous.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani laughed tonight, and responded by quoting Winston Churchill: ''Any person who isn't a liberal at 20 has no heart. And any person who isn't a conservative by 40 has no brain.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 5, 2000, Friday  An article yesterday about a town hall meeting held by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in Rochester referred incorrectly in some copies to his remarks about whether he would seek the endorsement of the Independence Party if Patrick J. Buchanan was its presidential nominee. The mayor said he would ''have to think long and hard,'' adding, ''I probably wouldn't want to be on that ticket.'' He did not explicitly say he would not appear on the ticket with Mr. Buchanan.</p>
