        <p>''Come and have a go if you think you're hard enough'' is a popular taunt dispatched by English football fans. Oasis took the chant to heart on Monday at Radio City Music Hall, displaying a stalwart machismo that belied the band's failed conquest of the United States.</p>
        <p>Pity these self-styled hellions, setting foot on these shores; nearly royals at home, they're treated like one-hit wonders here, after two albums that have fallen far short of their 1995 breakthrough album, ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'' The bluster that translates into instant news in London seems like pointless grandstanding in New York.</p>
        <p>But some locals do love Oasis, and the capacity audience at Radio City reveled in the band's dense fuzz-rock, cheering the sneers of the singer, Liam Gallagher, and the more congenial attempts to emote by his brother, the songwriter, guitarist, and occasional singer Noel. Working through a set that emphasized the band's latest effort, ''Standing on the Shoulder of Giants,'' Oasis absorbed adulation with steely arrogance.</p>
        <p>Thick music complemented the band's stance. The touring keyboardist, Mike Rowe, filled in any space between the guitars of Noel Gallagher, Gem Archer and the bassist Andy Bell. Alan White's big, broad drumming further activated the aggression meter. Pretty melodies pushed through the mix like flowers growing through a grate, helped along by Liam's irreparably wistful voice. But the sound was meant to tackle listeners, to prove that this music not only deserves but also demands to be heard.</p>
        <p>The band delivered its assault stonily. Liam stood like a policeman guarding a protest when not hunched before his microphone. Noel's amiable bellow made his songs, especially ''Don't Look Back in Anger,'' more agreeable, but he also barely shook a limb while rocking. No players seemed particularly engaged with the others. They were completing a mission, not enjoying themselves.</p>
        <p>The newfound sobriety of the Gallagher brothers, both of whom recently became fathers, has been touted as the reason for this tour's serious mood. It seems equally likely that Oasis, acutely conscious of its place in history, is trying the old trick of letting the music persuade.</p>
        <p>The band paraded its sources, showing video images of Strawberry Fields in Central Park while Noel aped the riff from the Beatles song it is named for, and later covering the Fab Four's ''Helter Skelter'' alongside Neil Young's ''Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black).'''' Like sportsmen rather than artists, these musicians stressed power and dependability over originality. For its fans, this worked; for a nonbeliever, Oasis seemed steeped in conservatism, satisfying on rock's basic level but tongue-tied behind the virile facade.</p>
        <p>Travis, the rising Scottish band that opened the show, is as derivative as Oasis, even borrowing from that band like a kid pilfering his big brother's soccer jersey. But the commonplaces Travis explores are more emotionally rich, and their spacious, tuneful songs sneak under the skin. ''This song is about being open,'' said the singer and chief songwriter, Fran Healy, introducing ''Driftwood.'' The artistic openness of Mr. Healy and his band mates was more winning, ultimately, than Oasis's show of strength.</p>
