        <p>His designation yesterday as American League pitcher of the month for April did not spare Pedro Martinez the iron fist of Major League Baseball's dealer of discipline, Frank Robinson.</p>
        <p>Robinson, vice president for on-field operations, suspended Martinez yesterday for five games for hitting Roberto Alomar with a pitch last Sunday after both teams had been warned about throwing at batters.</p>
        <p>Martinez immediately appealed the suspension, meaning he will be able to make his scheduled start Saturday against Tampa Bay. Bob Lenaghan, a union lawyer, said the pitcher's appeal would be heard next week at the earliest.</p>
        <p>Last week Robinson, who has replaced the extinct league presidents as the official who disciplines uniformed personnel for on-field incidents, suspended 1 coach, 2 managers and 13 players a total of 82 games for brawls in a game between the Detroit Tigers and the Chicago White Sox.</p>
        <p>The incident that gained Martinez a suspension that the players association believes is unprecedented occurred in a game between Boston and Cleveland. Martinez, en route to his fifth victory against no defeats for the Red Sox, brushed back Einar Diaz in the bottom of the seventh inning. Charles Nagy, the Indians' pitcher, hit Jose Offerman with a pitch in the eighth. The umpires issued a warning at that point, but Martinez nevertheless hit Alomar with a pitch in the Indians' eighth.</p>
        <p>Robinson, who also fined the two pitchers, did not explain the Martinez suspension, but a person familiar with baseball's disciplinary measures said Martinez might have avoided it if he had not acknowledged publicly that he deliberately hit Alomar.</p>
        <p>Lenaghan, however, questioned that explanation as a reason for the suspension. The disciplinary notice, the union lawyer said, cited only Martinez's throwing at and hitting Roberto Alomar after a warning had been issued.</p>
        <p>''A guy being disciplined,'' Lenaghan said, ''has the right to know what he's being disciplined for. He's not being disciplined for any public comments.''</p>
        <p>Lenaghan also said he believed there was no precedent for a five-game suspension for a pitcher who hits a batter after being warned when no fight erupted as a result.</p>

        <p>TWO TIGERS TO APPEAL SUSPENSIONS, FINES: Detroit's Juan Encarnacion and Robert Fick will appeal fines and suspensions levied against them by baseball following brawls with the Chicago White Sox on April 21.</p>
        <p>Fick was suspended for five games and Encarnacion for three for their roles in the bench-clearing fights. Keith Foulke of the White Sox and Luis Polonia and Jim Poole of the Tigers appealed their punishments earlier.</p>
        <p>Paul Beeston, baseball's president and chief operating officer, will hear the appeals. Six other players dropped their appeals.</p>

        <p>Prep Player Hits Safely in 52 Games</p>
        <p>Brandon Boles, a senior shortstop at Taylor High School in Kokomo, Ind., has set a national scholastic record by hitting safely in 52 consecutive games.</p>
        <p>His single off Eastern's Rich Lacy in the first inning Tuesday broke the previous record of 51 games he shared with two others -- Stan Brown of Cass High School in Indiana, who set the record in 1985, and Shawn Gallagher of Wilmington, N.C., who tied it 10 years later.</p>
        <p>Boles, who started his hitting streak in May 1998, went 2 for 4 with two runs batted in in the 7-1 victory over Eastern.</p>
