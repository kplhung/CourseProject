        <p>Accolades  In this season of honors, figurative laurels bedeck Lena Horne, Bernice Johnson Reagon and Deborah Eisenberg. On Saturday night Ms. Horne will receive the ''Living the Dream'' mentor award of the Manhattan Country School, 7 East 96th Street, at its annual Rent Party, a jazz benefit for its scholarship fund. Ms. Reagon, professor of history at American University, curator emeritus at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History and a 1989 MacArthur fellow, has been named the first recipient of the Leeway Foundation Leeway Laurel. The award, in recognition of a woman's lifelong achievement in the arts, carries a prize of $100,000. Ms. Eisenberg, cited for her ''luminous fiction,'' is this year's winner of the $30,000 Rea Award for the short story.</p>
