        <p>Both of his goals were nice, each in its own way, but neither was the best play of Jaromir Jagr's performance. His singular moment came on his assist -- what an assist! -- against the Philadelphia Flyers Tuesday night in Game 3 of the Pittsburgh Penguins' second-round series of the Stanley Cup playoffs.</p>
        <p>Skating with the puck on his stick, Jagr turned away from the Flyers' net and took off in the opposite direction. By the time he neared the blue line, Jagr had drawn three of the five Flyers' skaters into a merry chase. ''Of course, I know that,'' Jagr said, when asked about the people behind him. ''I was waiting for our defenseman to jump in the hole. You know where guys are.''</p>

        <p>Both of his goals were nice, each in its own way, but neither was the best play of Jaromir Jagr's performance. His singular moment came on his assist -- what an assist! -- against the Philadelphia Flyers Tuesday night in Game 3 of the Pittsburgh Penguins' second-round series of the Stanley Cup playoffs.</p>
        <p>Skating with the puck on his stick, Jagr turned away from the Flyers' net and took off in the opposite direction. By the time he neared the blue line, Jagr had drawn three of the five Flyers' skaters into a merry chase. ''Of course, I know that,'' Jagr said, when asked about the people behind him. ''I was waiting for our defenseman to jump in the hole. You know where guys are.''</p>
        <p>When the Penguins' defenseman, Bob Boughner, moved into the vacated space, Jagr turned and flipped a pass over a stick to him. Boughner redirected the puck diagonally across the zone to Martin Straka, who cut to the suddenly vulnerable net and knocked it past the goalie, Brian Boucher.</p>
        <p>It was no surprise that Jagr had created all three Pittsburgh goals. He is the league's reigning scoring champion and most valuable player. Going into games tonight, Jagr led the tournament in goals with 8 and in points with 16. Although his performance Tuesday was brilliant, it was not enough to avoid a 4-3 defeat in overtime, which left the Penguins leading the four-of-seven-game series by 2 games to 1. Game 4 is here on Thursday night and Jagr is confident. He said his team can play better and so can he.</p>
        <p>''Oh, of course,'' Jagr said. ''We lost one game in overtime. All of a sudden we're going to say 'They're better'? We're good enough to beat anybody.''</p>
        <p>Jagr said he had not fully recovered from the leg and back injuries that limited him to 63 appearances in the 82-game regular season.</p>
        <p>''Today I feel a little bit better,'' he said. ''It's going to be better and better, hopefully. My confidence is not here yet. My skating is not there.'' He said his current play is ''60 percent or 70 percent'' of his capability.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully, it's going to come,'' Jagr said, referring to his peak level. ''I need it. The team needs it.''</p>
        <p>The National Hockey League needs it, too. With Wayne Gretzky retired and Eric Lindros injured again, the sport needs a star-hook on which to hang its hype helmet, a charismatic attacker to improve the entertainment level from the defensive-deadened depths of recent seasons. Jagr, who apprenticed under Mario Lemieux in the 1990's, might be that man. In his 10th season, Jagr, 28, is the team's captain and the symbol of its composition.</p>
        <p>He is from the Czech Republic, and so are five of his teammates. Six more Penguins are from other European nations. The coach-in-waiting is Ivan Hlinka, the associate head coach, who is expected to replace Herb Brooks in the top job next season. Hlinka coached the Czech Republic to the Olympic gold medal in 1998. During practice today, while Hlinka spoke and gestured with his hands, Jagr rested on one knee in front of him, head raised, eyes fixed.</p>
        <p>The Penguins are owned now by Lemieux, who rescued them (and the money owed to him) from bankruptcy court. The general manager is Craig Patrick. Both men are among the progressives in their business. They are matched in this round against the Flyers, whose chairman, Ed Snider, and general manager, Bob Clarke, are among the league's traditionalists in terms of roster makeup. For the game on Tuesday, all but one of the Flyer players were from North America.</p>
        <p>In Game 2, frustrated by Pittsburgh's surprising two victories in Philadelphia, the Flyers started a 10-man brawl. Darius Kasparaitis, the Pittsburgh defenseman from Lithuania, was attacked by Keith Jones. ''This is the year 2000,'' Kasparaitis said. ''Not the year 1960. I don't know what they're trying to prove, but they don't scare us.''</p>
        <p>In terms of playing style, the Penguins are what is called an ''east-west'' team that attacks by skating and passing from side to side while waiting for the perfect shooting moment. The Flyers are a ''north-south'' team that rushes down lanes and fires lots of shots. In Game 3, the Flyers outshot the Penguins by 44-18. They have many good players suited to this style. Among them is John LeClair, the big left wing, who scored once and knocked two Pittsburgh defensemen out of the game, at least temporarily, after heavy, unpenalized collisions.</p>
        <p>No doubt the Flyers would love to do the same to Jagr, but he is both strong and slippery, difficult to hit. Commit too soon and he will embarrass you, the way he did several times Tuesday against Philadelphia defenseman Eric Desjardins, the Flyers' captain and one of the best at his craft. ''What are they going to do?'' Jagr asked rhetorically. ''I've played the game long enough to control it the way I want to.''</p>
        <p>Like Lemieux before him, Jagr complains frequently about the holding, hooking, tripping and interference that often goes without penalty and allows mediocre players to bring good players down to their level. For relaxation, Jagr said, he has an interesting choice of sports on television.</p>
        <p>''I don't watch hockey, I watch basketball playoffs,'' Jagr said. ''Look at Allen Iverson. If you are good enough and fast enough, no way they are going to stop you. In hockey, they play physical, with body checks, and they put the stick on you. In basketball, they can't even put a hand on you. That's what I like about that game. In hockey, it's not that easy.''</p>
        <p>Certainly, he was exaggerating for effect. But his analogies and observations suggest a larger issue. In the immediate sense, the Penguins and Flyers are playing only for the right to meet the Devils or Toronto in the Eastern Conference finals. In the larger sense, it sometimes seems as if these two teams are struggling for the soul of their sport.</p>
