        <p>JONATHAN TELLER resorted to an appeal to the chairman of Bell Atlantic. Denise Klarquist lost her telephone service entirely. Bill Hipps sent letters to his local newspaper. For weeks James Williams couldn't figure out why he was dropped at precisely the same time every night.</p>
        <p>They are strangers to one another, living different lives thousands of miles apart. Yet they have the same problem: all were thwarted in their attempts to establish and maintain D.S.L. service in their homes. All four reached levels of vexation that they did not know were possible when dealing with their local phone companies.</p>
        <p>Just getting a phone company to fill an order and install D.S.L. may seem to be a major hurdle. But for these subscribers, getting their orders filled was the easy part.</p>
        <p>For them, and for many others, the real nightmare of D.S.L. began after the installation. That's when customers can experience a range of problems, from misconfigured software to widespread service outages.</p>
        <p>Demand continues to swell for D.S.L., or digital subscriber line, service, a form of high-speed Internet connection that is becoming as familiar a term to the online world as http. By the end of this year, said Fritz McCormick, an analyst at the Yankee Group, there will be 900,000 D.S.L. subscribers in the United States and more than double that number by the end of 2001.</p>
        <p>But D.S.L., as a new technology, is bound to have unexpected hiccups. Add to that the huge demand for the service, mix in a lot of competitive fervor on the part of the local phone companies and dozens of other D.S.L. providers, and you have a recipe for a genuine mess.</p>
        <p>High-speed Internet connections via cable modems, which currently outsell D.S.L., have their share of problems, too. But many of the complaints about cable modems focus on the slowdowns that occur when the connection is shared by multiple customers.</p>
        <p>The beauty of D.S.L. is that it delivers fast Web connections to homes and small businesses over ordinary telephone lines. D.S.L. users can make or receive calls on the same lines used to connect to the Internet.</p>
        <p>One customer whose patience wore thin is Bill Hipps. ''My take on the whole situation is probably that the D.S.L. industry is growing too fast,'' he said, ''and that the technology hasn't been tested enough with all the volume and variables.''</p>
        <p>For nearly nine months, Mr. Hipps, a software developer in Salt Lake City, has had D.S.L. service from U S West.net. Half the time he has had ''really great service,'' he said, and the rest of the time he has been unable to get a connection. At one point, he said, his service was down for a month, and none of the dozens of customer service representatives he spoke with could help.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hipps had all but given up. When he wanted a reliable connection, he used his old dial-up connection. It was slow, 56 kilobits per second, but not nearly so fickle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hipps likened his predicament to being in an abusive relationship. ''When I could get on my computer, and things were working properly, it was great, it was fast,'' he said. ''But you never knew if that guy was going to come home drunk and slap you around a little bit. You never knew what to expect when you sat down to the computer.''</p>
        <p>As it turned out, the problem lay with a computer at U S West.net. The problem was fixed, and for now at least, Mr. Hipps is a happy customer. ''I'm kind of waiting for the other shoe to drop,'' he said. ''It won't surprise me if I turn on my computer and it doesn't work again.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, for every dissatisfied customer around the country, there are many others who couldn't be happier with D.S.L. ''The vast majority of our customers are just thrilled with it,'' said Mike McLeland, vice president of operations at SBC Advanced Solutions, a subsidiary of SBC Communications, a regional phone company that provides D.S.L. service in 13 states. Mr. McLeland is downright sanguine about the situation. ''Managing growth is a great problem to have,'' he said.</p>
        <p>SBC has promised to make D.S.L. available to 80 percent of its telephone customers by the end of 2002 through an accelerated $6 billion effort called Project Pronto. The company already has 201,000 subscribers with service up and running.</p>
        <p>Further, Mr. McLeland said, SBC is ''well down the path'' in achieving what he called the ''five 9's'' network: D.S.L. service that is up and running 99.999 percent of the time. Bell Atlantic said it currently had its service up about 99.5 percent of the time.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Teller, an Internet consultant in Manhattan, has trouble believing those numbers. One day late last month, his service went down, and no amount of tinkering with his computer's settings could bring the connection back.</p>
        <p>After days of calling customer support in vain, Mr. Teller sent a letter via Federal Express to Bell Atlantic's chairman, Ivan Seidenberg. He got a phone call from someone on the company's presidential appeals team, who conferred an elevated status to his ''trouble ticket.'' When he called customer support after that, Mr. Teller said, ''a supervisor would say, 'Oh, wow, you have a presidential appeals ticket.' '' But he added, ''They'd be really impressed, but it wouldn't get me anywhere.''</p>
        <p>Seventeen days and countless telephone calls after his service went out, Mr. Teller said, he received a call from a Bell Atlantic networking expert, perhaps the one remaining person at the company he had not yet spoken with.</p>
        <p>''He hung up, then called back a few minutes later and said, 'Try it now,' '' Mr. Teller recalled. The connection was back. As it turned out, the company had upgraded some hardware and the settings on his account needed a simple tweak.</p>
        <p>Mr. Teller has since switched service providers, to a company called ACE D.S.L., but he had some trouble getting Bell Atlantic to process his request.</p>
        <p>When they hear stories like Mr. Teller's, Bell Atlantic officials acknowledge their unhappiness with the current quality of service. ''We are absolutely not satisfied,'' said Myles Mendelsohn, vice president and general manager of Bell Atlantic Internet Solutions, the Internet service provider for Bell Atlantic. ''Bell Atlantic is addressing it as aggressively as they can.'' The company has added 600 people to its maintenance, technical support and sales force and has ''teams working around the clock to address issues that impact customers,'' said Joan Rasmussen, a Bell Atlantic spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Bell Atlantic appears to have the biggest share of D.S.L. glitches -- enough, that is, to inspire a lawsuit. Filed in New York State Supreme Court in February on behalf of seven dissatisfied customers, the lawsuit accuses the company of deceptive advertising and breach of warranty.</p>
        <p>''They promote their product by saying it's fast, easy to install and reliable, but it's none of those things,'' said Mark S. Kaufman, a lawyer in New York who is representing the plaintiffs. ''In fact, it's a beta product. They're basically distributing a beta product before it's final and ready for mass consumption.''</p>
        <p>Bell Atlantic has responded with a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that customers clicked on an ''I accept'' button during installation, thereby agreeing to all service terms, including a disclaimer of any warranty for error-free service.</p>
        <p>Enough Bell Atlantic subscribers are in high dudgeon that an independent noncommercial Web site called Bell Watch 2000 has sprung up in recent weeks. The site is a repository for both complaints and praise from Bell Atlantic subscribers; it also provides tips for visitors to the site that include contact numbers at Bell Atlantic.</p>
        <p>''It is not our desire to sling mud at Bell Atlantic,'' the site says. ''We want this great corporation to understand that their success should mean that new technology should work properly before it's foisted upon the public.''</p>
        <p>The greatest source of annoyance is the level of customer support or, as many companies now label it, customer care.</p>
        <p>Phone companies and other D.S.L. service providers need hundreds of customer service representatives to handle the flood of inquiries and service and repair requests, so they are retraining and hiring workers. Along with the shortage of trained personnel has come a lack of efficiency and, some say, a lack of competence.</p>
        <p>Some frustrated D.S.L. subscribers have even taken to logging the number of fruitless hours they spend on the phone with customer support employees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hipps said he had racked up 65 hours, acquainting himself with every aspect of U S West's customer support hierarchy.</p>
        <p>James Williams, a police officer in Philadelphia, is all too familiar with Bell Atlantic's customer support. Mr. Williams said he had encountered three serious problems since he first got his D.S.L. service three months ago. With each problem, he said, he talked to a minimum of five people.</p>
        <p>In the process, Mr. Williams became something of a D.S.L. expert. He tosses  around D.S.L. jargon as if he invented it. Terms like DSlam (digital subscriber line access multiplexer, the equipment that sends data into a bigger data pipe), C.O. (central office, the place where the switching equipment resides) and throughput (transmission speed) trip off his tongue.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Williams, who prefers to do his Web surfing before dawn, would gladly have traded all that knowledge for a cure for his strangest problem. At least twice a week at 4:30 ''on the dot,'' he said, his service went down. ''I took that as my cue to go to bed,'' he said. Mr. Williams was assured that the service was not being taken down for routine maintenance. The problem has been fixed, but its cause remains a mystery.</p>
        <p>Trying times call for creative measures.</p>
        <p>Bell Atlantic has taken to dispatching technicians to customers' homes. ''If all the basic things we do can't help us nail it down, we'll send someone out with a laptop,'' Mr. Mendelsohn said. By using the company's computer instead of the customer's, the technician can determine whether the problem is with a setting in the customer's computer or with the D.S.L. service.</p>
        <p>It's nice to have technicians come to the house -- until it begins to look as though they may never leave.</p>
        <p>Ms. Klarquist, marketing director for a market research firm in San Francisco, ordered D.S.L. service from Pacific Bell, which is owned by SBC, at the end of March. The installer arrived at 4:30 one afternoon and stayed until 9 p.m. trying to get her service up and running. ''It worked for about 5 or 10 seconds, then it didn't work at  all,'' she said. That went on all evening. ''Every time something came up, he said, 'Gee, I've never seen that before.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Klarquist said she had considered offering him a beer but thought better of it. ''I thought that would probably really mess him up,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Several days passed and she still had no service. She devoted hours to calling the customer support line. Then she came home one day to find that all telephone service to her house had been obliterated, and she was forced to make all calls from her cell phone.</p>
        <p>Five days later, her phone service was restored, and when a friend stopped by for a visit, she asked him to take a look at her D.S.L. setup. ''He said, 'I think I can figure this out,' and within 20 minutes it was up and running,'' she recalled. As it turned out, a Web browser setting needed to be changed.</p>
        <p>Now, finally, Ms. Klarquist has D.S.L. service, ''but no thanks to Pacific Bell,'' she said. ''Now every time I see a PacBell Internet commercial, I feel like drop-kicking my television.''</p>
        <p>The frustration runs both ways, of course. ''We've seen, as you can imagine, everything under the sun,'' said Mr. Mendelsohn,  of Bell Atlantic. ''People who've moved jacks and plugged into the wrong line, and customers installing other software. All of that fouls up communication.''</p>
        <p>To cope with the explosion in demand, SBC, Bell Atlantic and other companies are moving toward having customers do their own installations -- the D.S.L. provider simply sends customers the hardware and software they need to do it themselves. Eighty-five percent of Bell Atlantic's D.S.L. customers handle their own installations, and SBC plans to start offering the option by May. U S West has offered customer installation since 1998.</p>
        <p>Another solution being considered by Bell Atlantic and others is remote diagnoses of customers' computer setups. That is, each support technician, with the customer's permission, is given remote access to the customer's computer to check settings and other potential causes of a snag.</p>
        <p>And one novel approach to the shortage of customer service technicians is to let technicians work from home. Telocity, a broadband provider in Cupertino, Calif., that uses D.S.L., has hired 100 part-time customer support employees in the Chicago area. Instead of requiring them to work in large call centers, the company routes calls to the employees' homes.</p>
        <p>''They provide the computer, two phone lines and a quiet professional environment,'' said Jim Rohrer, Telocity's customer care officer. ''No barking dogs and no children in the background.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rohrer said he was convinced that this approach would attract a higher caliber of employee. ''We're getting college-degreed folks who would never come to work at a call center,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Yet the learning curve remains steep, and for some customers, it is already too late. Earlier this month, Ajit Tharaken, a programmer in Manhattan, canceled his D.S.L. service from Bell Atlantic after two months of spotty connections and ordered service from a competing D.S.L. carrier. ''When I canceled, they did not ask me for my reasons for canceling,'' Mr. Tharaken said. ''I do not think they care.''</p>
