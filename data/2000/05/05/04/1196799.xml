        <p>Connecticut lawmakers put the finishing touches on a $12.3 billion state budget today, ending this year's legislative  session on an unusual note of bipartisan amity.</p>
        <p>Before the clocks struck midnight, ending this year's 12-week session, the General Assembly had unanimously passed the state budget for the 2001 fiscal year and allocated this year's approximately $250 million surplus to several projects, including a bailout of the state's largest hospital and giving $34 million extra to cities and towns.</p>
        <p>All 187 lawmakers voted for the budget, which includes a 7-cent-a-gallon cut in the state gasoline tax and an exemption on sales tax for up to $300 in back-to-school clothes, as it sailed through Connecticut's House of Representatives and Senate Tuesday evening.</p>
        <p>''I cannot remember a unanimous budget in both chambers,'' said Kevin B. Sullivan, the State Senate president pro tempore, who has been in office since 1986. ''This is the most clear demonstration of consenus that I have ever seen, ever.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, with their big bills out of the way and a near-perfect spring day beckoning from outside, lawmakers seemed usually giddy today, like college kids in their final class before spring break. Several times, House and Senate leaders had to stop and scold their colleagues for chattering and not paying attention to the matter at hand.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to ask once again to please keep the noise level down,'' Lieutenant Governor Jodi Rell, the Senate president, told Connecticut's 36 state Senators, sounding more like a lunchroom monitor than the state's second-ranking executive. After they quieted down, she warned, ''If I have to ask you again, I may have to ask you to leave the chamber.''</p>
        <p>Their exuberance was perhaps understandable. On Tuesday, after three days of squabbling that nearly sank a $771 million construction and redevelopment package for downtown Hartford, the Democratic-led House and Senate passed the bill and Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican,  quickly signed it.</p>
        <p>Leaders of both parties hailed the project, the state's largest urban construction project in nearly 40 years, as the advent of a new era in a city with persistent economic problems.</p>
        <p>The bill allocates $529 million in public funds -- most of it from state bonds -- to build a hotel and convention center, college football stadium and luxury apartment tower along Hartford's long-ignored riverfront. Last Friday, disagreements between labor unions and the project developer, the Waterford Group, threatened to scuttle the 33-acre project, known as Adriaen's Landing.</p>
        <p>Last-minute negotiations Monday saved the deal, which includes about $230 million in private investments. The deal assured that Hartford and East Hartford, its impoverished neighbor across the Connecticut River, where the new University of Connecticut football stadium will be built, will be clogged with construction cranes for at least two years, starting next spring.</p>
        <p>''Adriaen's is the toughest thing I've ever had to deal with,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''It will never make Hartford into what Baltimore is,'' he added, contradicting some of the more lofty predictions heard at the Capitol lately, ''but it might make Hartford into what Providence has become.''</p>
        <p>Tony Caruso, the executive director of the Hartford Downtown Council, a business group, said Adriaen's Landing was ''a great start for the next millennium.''</p>
        <p>The budget agreement includes Governor Rowland's top fiscal priority: a 7-cent reduction in the state's 32-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax, the highest in the nation, beginning July 1.</p>
        <p>The new budget also includes much of the Democrats' wish list. It  increases the price of clothing exempt from the state's sales tax from  $50 to $75 per item and creates another tax exemption for up to $300 worth of clothing and shoes bought at any one time in August, before school resumes.</p>
        <p>Other major items this session included a bill that authorized a referendum in November, on whether to abolish the state's sheriff's system.  One sheriff faces charges of carrying an assault rifle into a courthouse; a sheriff's deputy faces charges of firing a gun at motorists after a traffic dispute.</p>
        <p>Governor Rowland signed a bill that tightens the rules limiting who may collect a finder's fee for arranging investments of state money.</p>
        <p>The measure was prompted by the case of a former state treasurer, Paul Silvester, who pleaded guilty in September to charges of racketeering and money laundering. He admitted accepting kickbacks from finder's fees paid by companies with which he invested state pension money.</p>
