        <p>Though Bestfoods rejected an $18.4 billion takeover outright on Tuesday, Unilever seemed poised to sweeten its offer yesterday for the company, which makes Hellmann's mayonnaise and Thomas' English muffins.</p>
        <p>Two executives close to the situation said they expected Unilever to raise its existing cash bid of $66 a share by the end of the week. Unilever first bid a range of $61 to $64. A stock analyst in New York said a price of $70 was possible, given the target company's solid business and the eagerness of Unilever, which makes household products as well as packaged foods, to expand in the food industry.</p>
        <p>Investors seemed to favor a deal as they sent the stock of Bestfoods up $10.6875 yesterday, to $61.25, in New York Stock Exchange trading.</p>
        <p>Bestfoods' chief executive, meanwhile, insisted that his company had no desire for such a merger. And his board unanimously rejected the offer, saying it did not think there was an opportunity for a sale of the company.</p>
        <p>''We've got a ship that's going down the river right now that is doing very well, thank you,'' said Charles R. Shoemate, who has held the position of chief executive for the last 10 years. ''And we're going to keep doing what we've been doing.''</p>
        <p>At the Unilever annual meeting in London, the company's co-chairmen, Niall FitzGerald and Antony Burgmans, repeated their position that Bestfoods had until the end of today to respond to the offer. Executives with knowledge of the takeover attempt said Unilever was lining up a $20 billion loan to finance the transaction, suggesting it expected to prevail. The loan is being syndicated by four banks: ABN Amro, Deutsche Bank, Warburg Dillon Read and Goldman, Sachs. Goldman, Sachs is advising Unilever in the takeover effort. Bestfoods' bankers are Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup.</p>
        <p>Several analysts speculated that a higher offer could be used to coax friendly talks because it would be costly and time-consuming for Unilever to attempt a hostile takeover given that there are anti-takeover provisions in place at Bestfoods.</p>
        <p>Unilever, which is based in London and Amsterdam, has been on an acquisition binge even though it announced plans in February to shed more than 1,000 local and regional brands and to cut 25,000 jobs to focus on its best-performing businesses. Just three weeks ago, it reached an agreement to buy Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade for $326 million. The same day, it announced it would pay $2.6 billion for Slim-Fast Foods, the diet company.</p>
        <p>Behind the mergers lies one undeniable fact: the rapid consolidation of the supermarket industry over the last two years has shifted power from the food companies to the retailers. For the companies to regain bargaining power, they, too, have to consolidate, said Jeffrey G. Kanter, an analyst with Prudential Securities.</p>
        <p>''We have always said the manufacturer has to fight back, and an easy way of doing it is to get bigger,'' he said. ''They have to have enough clout where they have products in every one of those inner aisles and can go to the retailer with a larger voice.''</p>
        <p>The increasingly global operations of some retailers, like Royal Ahold and Carrefours, put additional pressure on manufacturers to grow. ''If those retailers say they want to do global sourcing and cut deals for their chains, are you going to be able to deliver or not?'' asked James Hagan, an assistant professor for global marketing strategy at Cornell University. ''To a certain extent, a merger can give you the scope to allow you to be a global supplier.''</p>
        <p>Adding Bestfoods, which is one-fifth the size of Unilever, would make Unilever, together with Ben &amp; Jerry's and Slim-Fast, larger than Nestle, the global leader in packaged food. The combined companies would have revenue of about $46 billion.</p>
        <p>Bestfoods, which is based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., has had solid sales growth, about half of it generated by buying other brands, and has many successful overseas divisions, particularly in Latin America. Among its well-known products are Skippy peanut butter, Knorr soups, Entenmann's baked goods, Mazola cooking oil and Mueller's pasta.</p>
        <p>Though earnings have grown 10 percent or more annually over the last 10 years, Bestfoods' share price has been disappointing. One stock analyst said that the company could have bought back stock or taken other steps to bolster its share price, rather than waiting for Unilever to do it.</p>
        <p>Bestfoods led other food stocks higher yesterday in an otherwise dismal day in the market, while Unilever's American depository receipts dropped $2.1875, to $22.5625.</p>
        <p>But the entire sector has been lagging, with growth slowing in the second half of the 1990's and investors flocking instead to booming sectors like technology and telecommunications. While a peer group of food company stocks rose 1.6 percent in 1998 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 31.5 percent, Bestfoods' share price fell 1.5 percent, said John R. McMillin, a food stocks analyst for Prudential. Last year, Bestfoods beat the peer group, falling 1.3 percent while the group declined 15.5 percent, but the rest of the market rose 24.5 percent, he said. Six weeks ago, Bestfoods shares traded at $42.</p>
        <p>At $66 a share, companies like H. J. Heinz, which approached Bestfoods about a possible merger last summer, would be unlikely participants, Mr. Kanter said. Multinational giants like Nestle might be interested, but would probably face antitrust issues, another stock analyst said. A possible contender is Philip Morris, which owns Kraft.</p>
        <p>''We do a lot of acquisitions, so we are obviously in favor of combining one business with another,'' Mr. Shoemate said. ''But big does not make you good. You get good by being big in brand power and profit growth. There are lots of examples of companies that lose their focus and get big for big's sake.''</p>
