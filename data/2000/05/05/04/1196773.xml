        <p>Backed by three warships reported to be carrying hundreds of marines, the Justice Department is ready to sweep into the Puerto Rican island of Vieques and remove demonstrators who oppose American military training there. Senior administration officials said today that the action could come as early as dawn on Thursday.</p>
        <p>As many as 500 federal marshals and F.B.I. agents are expected to take part in the move to dislodge the protesters, who have managed to halt the Navy's use of the eastern end of the 52-square-mile island for more than a year.</p>

        <p>Backed by three warships reported to be carrying hundreds of marines, the Justice Department is ready to sweep into the Puerto Rican island of Vieques and remove demonstrators who oppose American military training there. Senior administration officials said today that the action could come as early as dawn on Thursday.</p>
        <p>As many as 500 federal marshals and F.B.I. agents are expected to take part in the move to dislodge the protesters, who have managed to halt the Navy's use of the eastern end of the 52-square-mile island for more than a year.</p>
        <p>The officials cautioned that the exercise, which has been expected for several days, could be called off at the last minute.</p>
        <p>The protesters began settling into the Camp Garcia Army Range last year after Navy bombers accidentally killed an island resident, David Sanes Rodriguez, a guard. The site has since become a rallying point for opponents of the vast American military presence in Puerto Rico, a commonwealth of the United States.</p>
        <p>The protests have frustrated Pentagon officials who insist that the 60-year-old firing range provides an irreplaceable training site, allowing for simultaneous exercises involving planes, ships and amphibious craft. The scenic island, which has rich coral reefs, is littered with unexploded ordnance.</p>
        <p>Under a Jan. 31 agreement between President Clinton and Puerto Rican officials, the Navy agreed to conduct bombing practice with dummy shells. The deal, which was to secure the Navy's use of the island until 2003, guaranteed $40 million in federal aid for the 9,400 islanders who live near the target range.</p>
        <p>The Navy promised, moreover, to clean up hundreds of tons of munitions from the western third of the island and hand it back to Puerto Rican control later this year.</p>
        <p>The first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, aligned herself with critics of the accord today, asserting that ''a small, inhabited island should not be used for target practice.'' Mrs. Clinton, a candidate for the Senate in New York, a state with a large Puerto Rican population, said, ''I urge the Pentagon to negotiate a peaceful resolution to this problem.''</p>
        <p>Representatives Nydia M. Velazquez, Democrat of Brooklyn, and Luis V. Gutierrez, Democrat of Illinois, went to Vieques to assess the situation and encourage the protesters.</p>
        <p>Ms. Velazquez, who was born in Puerto Rico, warned that a use of federal force would not only upset many of Puerto Rico's four million residents, but also antagonize Puerto Ricans living on the mainland.</p>
        <p>Attorney General Janet Reno is expected to direct the raid, marking her second use of federal force in a month in a volatile situation involving Hispanic groups. Less than two weeks ago, Ms. Reno oversaw the seizure of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy who had been living with relatives in Miami after his rescue at sea in November, in a display that many Cuban-Americans and their political allies denounced as excessive.</p>
        <p>On Vieques, anxiety gripped islanders who for days have shared rumors of ''impending invasion'' by federal forces.</p>
        <p>Dozens of protesters who have stationed themselves at the main entrance gate to the firing range seemed split between doubt over a brewing confrontation and a determination to complete their vigil.</p>
        <p>Several voiced hopes that the situation would not erupt in violence.</p>
        <p>Manuela Santiago, the mayor of Vieques, said she and others on the island feared that some protesters who have come here from the main island of Puerto Rico might provoke violence.</p>
        <p>Also at the site today was Lolita Lebron, who was convicted in the attack by Puerto Rican nationalists on Congress in 1954 and pardoned by Mr. President Clinton last fall.</p>
        <p>''I have renounced violence,'' Ms. Lebron said, ''but I am still fighting for the freedom of the Puerto Rican people.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lebron, who is now 80, said, ''I want to be arrested with the people of Vieques who want to stop the bombing and tell the American government they have abused this paradise for too many years.</p>
        <p>''I just hope the Americans don't keep an old lady like me waiting too long in this heat.''</p>
