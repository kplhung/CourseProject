        <p>With supporters of a China trade bill scrambling for every vote, a Michigan Democrat in the House is planning to introduce legislation this week that he predicts will rescue the Clinton administration's top remaining foreign policy goal from potential defeat.</p>

        <p>With supporters of a China trade bill scrambling for every vote, a Michigan Democrat in the House is planning to introduce legislation this week that he predicts will rescue the Clinton administration's top remaining foreign policy goal from potential defeat.</p>
        <p>The legislator, Sander M. Levin, said today that he is putting the final touches on a proposal to establish a commission with powers to review human rights, labor policies and development of the rule of law in China. After weeks of test-marketing in Congress, Mr. Levin said his proposal for parallel legislation to the trade bill could recruit enough fence-sitting Democrats to tip the balance in favor of the administration.</p>
        <p>The bill would set up a commission consisting of nine members of each house of Congress, five presidential appointees and a full-time staff. The body would study China issues and advise both Congress and the White House on legislation or administrative steps, including United States policy on lending by the World Bank. That would keep pressure on Beijing to comply with its trade commitments and improve human rights, Mr. Levin said.</p>
        <p>Opponents of extending permanent normal trade relations have dismissed Mr. Levin's proposal as a fig leaf, saying the commission would have no real powers of enforcement. Both the Clinton administration and the Republican Congressional leadership had kept their distance.</p>
        <p>But Democrats, Republicans and administration officials are now saying that the Levin proposal attracts more votes for elevating China trade relations than it loses, especially among uncommitted Democrats. House vote counters said the Levin commission had helped recruit at least 15 Democratic yes votes, badly needed ones if the administration is to reach the minimum 70 Democratic supporters it claims it must have.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders say they can produce 140 to 150 votes for the trade bill, but will rely on Democrats to push the total over the 218 necessary to pass the House. The House vote is scheduled for late May. Approval in the Senate is seen as certain.</p>
        <p>''I think the Levin proposal will be responsible for 15 votes and maybe more,'' said Robert T. Matsui, the California Democrat who is leading the effort to round up Democratic votes in the House. ''It gives me what I need.''</p>
        <p>Commerce Secretary William M. Daley, who is leading the administration's lobbying effort on the bill, today called Mr. Levin's proposal ''an extremely good plan.'' Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who heads the Ways and Means Committee, also spoke favorably about the idea at hearings on China trade.</p>
        <p>The China trade measure also got a lift today when House and Senate negotiators agreed on details of a bill to give African and Caribbean countries wide-ranging trade benefits aimed at helping their ailing economies. The House could vote on the compromise as early as Thursday.</p>
        <p>As many as half a dozen House Democrats have suggested that they would not vote for the China measure until the House first passed the Africa trade bill.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Clinton administration announced plans to beef up the team the government employs to police compliance with trade accords, with special emphasis on china. Mr. Daley said the administration would ask for $22 million in extra spending for trade enforcement and export promotion. Some of that money would pay for new personnel who would focus specifically on whether China meets its market-opening obligations after it enters the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin designed his proposal to resemble the Helsinki Commission, a joint commission of Congress and the White House set up in 1976 to monitor human rights in the Soviet bloc. The idea is to give members of Congress sway over China policy even if it agrees to sacrifice its annual review of that nation's trading rights, a step that's necessary if American companies are to benefit fully from concessions China made in its bid to join the W.T.O.</p>
        <p>''This is something that should be an important part of our trade policy - a way to shape globalization,'' Mr. Levin said.</p>
        <p>House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt had his own plan for setting up an investigation and enforcement body for trade with China with the authority to mandate sanctions if China failed to live up to its trade obligations or to international labor standards. But the Clinton administration firmly rejected any proposal that would have the power to mandate sanctions, calling that inconsistent with America's obligations under W.T.O. rules. Mr. Gephardt has said he will vote against the China trade bill.</p>
        <p>Critics say Mr. Levin's proposal is a watered down version of Mr. Gephardt's and does not deserve broad support.</p>
        <p>But it has elicited enthusiasm among some Republicans. Representative Doug Bereuter, a Nebraska Republican who has been working closely with Mr. Levin, said he planned to present it to the House Republican leadership for their blessing. He said the commission could sway several undecided Republicans to vote for the China bill.</p>
