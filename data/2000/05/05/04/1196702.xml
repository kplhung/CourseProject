        <p>LIPTON'S ICED TEA, seeking to shore up its eroding market share, will soon have a new bottle and a new campaign, its first major advertising effort for the brand in four years.</p>
        <p>The Pepsi-Lipton Tea Partnership, a joint venture between Unilever, which owns Lipton Tea, and the Pepsi-Cola Company, a unit of PepsiCo, has produced Lipton's Iced Tea since 1992.</p>
        <p>In recent years, it has focused its marketing and advertising efforts on Lipton Brisk, a ready-to-drink tea produced and sold like a soft drink, rather than on Lipton's Iced Tea, a more expensive bottled beverage made from real brewed tea.</p>
        <p>But Lipton's Iced Tea's share of sales of all ready-to-drink bottled and canned teas has been steadily slipping, declining to 9.5 percent last year from 10.8 percent in 1997, according to Information Resources, Inc., a research firm specializing in consumer packaged goods.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the ready-to-drink tea category as a whole has grown. According to I.R.I., sales of all bottled and canned teas jumped 9.9 percent in 1998 and 6.1 percent in 1999. Sales of premium teas rose 3.7 percent in 1998 and 5 percent in 1999.</p>
        <p>So the Pepsi-Lipton partnership decided to ''rebuild the values and personality of Lipton's Iced Tea,'' said Stephane Jacqmin, the partnership's senior marketing manager for Lipton's Iced Tea. ''We needed to stand for something.''</p>
        <p>The strategy is to try to differentiate Lipton's Iced Tea from its main competitors, Snapple, which has 14.6 percent of the bottled and canned tea market, and Arizona Iced Tea, which has 10.9 percent.</p>
        <p>The first part of that strategy is a new glass bottle, which is being introduced in the Northeast this month. The bottle is taller and thinner than the old one, though both are clear and contain 16 ounces of tea, which is produced in nine flavors.</p>
        <p>Gary Hemphill, a vice president of the Beverage Marketing Corporation, a New York-based research firm, applauded the decision to try a new bottle. ''Eye-catching proprietary packaging is really essential,'' he said. ''The consumer makes his buying decision at the retail shelf. Packaging often sells the product.''</p>
        <p>The advertisements for Lipton's Iced Tea, created by J. Walter Thompson, a unit of the WPP Group, are aimed at adults in their late 20's who may not have established their tea-drinking habits.</p>
        <p>Commercials will start running in late May, before the peak summer sales season begins, in three markets: New York, Pittsburgh and Harrisburg, Pa. Company officials said the campaign will run nationwide next spring and summer, once the partnership's bottling plants are fully up to speed.</p>
        <p>The budget for this year, when advertising will run through September, will be under the $9.9 million that Lipton's Iced Tea spent on advertising in 1996, according to Competitive Media Reporting. Executives said spending next year would reach this level.</p>
        <p>The premise behind the ads, said Stephanie Hancock, a senior partner of J. Walter Thompson, is that ''when you drink Lipton's Iced Tea, you're so refreshed it might be too much of a good thing.''</p>
        <p>So, a television commercial depicts a young man clipping hedges while drinking Lipton's. The owner of the house whose hedges he has been clipping asks him what he is doing.  When the homeowner discovers his bush has been trimmed into the shape of a giant rabbit, he asks the young man to leave. As he departs, viewers see that the young man has cut all the bushes on the block into giant animal shapes.</p>
        <p>Outdoor advertising, which will run on buses, aerial banners and commuter train and subway platforms, takes a similar tack, showing tea drinkers getting carried away in their tasks, while humorous 60-second radio spots recount '' 'Over-refreshed,' the continuing saga of a young man named Ed and his Lipton Iced Tea.''</p>
        <p>All advertising carries the tag line ''You'll feel good. Maybe too good.''</p>
        <p>Jennifer Solomon, a beverage industry analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, said the Lipton's Iced Tea initiative represented ''a recognition by Pepsi-Cola of how important the tea business remains, important enough that they're emphasizing both Lipton's Iced Tea and Lipton Brisk.''</p>
        <p>''It clearly says these are categories the big soft drink guys continue to care about beyond cola,'' she noted.</p>
