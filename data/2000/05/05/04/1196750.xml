        <p>One man was killed and another was injured yesterday when a garage in the Bronx collapsed, showering them with concrete and bricks, Fire Department officials said.</p>
        <p>The two men were among four workers cleaning out the two-car garage, on East 168th Street behind a row of three-story buildings in the Morrisania section, when the 12-inch, reinforced concrete roof caved in shortly after 2 p.m.</p>

        <p>One man was killed and another was injured yesterday when a garage in the Bronx collapsed, showering them with concrete and bricks, Fire Department officials said.</p>
        <p>The two men were among four workers cleaning out the two-car garage, on East 168th Street behind a row of three-story buildings in the Morrisania section, when the 12-inch, reinforced concrete roof caved in shortly after 2 p.m.</p>
        <p>Two of the men scrambled to safety and were not seriously hurt, fire officials said, but the other two were trapped and had to be removed by firefighters.</p>
        <p>One of the trapped workers, identified by fire officials as Leon Williams, who was in his 40's and lived at 1349 Rosedale Avenue in the Bronx, was crushed to death by the debris.</p>
        <p>The other man, whose legs had been trapped in the rubble, was identified by the police as Paul Bowen, 33, of the same address. He was listed in stable condition last night at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''I heard things shake and then I saw it all go down,'' said Ismael Mejias, who was walking past when the roof collapsed. ''And then I heard screams: 'Help! Help! Help! Get me out of here! Get me out of here!' ''</p>
        <p>Paul Wein, a spokesman for the Buildings Department, said the workers had been removing a ''significant portion'' of one of the walls of the garage. Because the men were working inside the garage without the necessary permit, Mr. Wein said, buildings inspectors issued a violation notice to the owners of the garage and an adjoining three-story building on Findlay Avenue.</p>
        <p>Agustin Fajardo, who bought the property at 1225 Findlay with his wife, Isla Fajardo, last October, said he arrived at the scene shortly after the collapse. As he watched firefighters inspect the damage, Mr. Fajardo said the the workers were friends who had been cleaning out garbage, mattresses, wood beams and other junk when the accident took place.</p>
        <p>Firefighters from a nearby company were summoned by residents and arrived to hear Mr. Bowen pleading for help. The firefighters used special air bags and wood beams to lift and shore up the collapsed roof, and then burrowed through the debris to reach him.</p>
        <p>''There was enough room for one to go in,'' said Firefighter John South of Ladder Co. 44, who was the first firefighter into the collapsed structure. He said he could see Mr. Bowen, who told him, ''I'm hurting, and you got to get my friend out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bowen was pulled from the rubble in about seven minutes, fire officials said. Then Firefighter Chris Blackwell inched his way to Mr. Williams, who he could see was doubled over under the weight of the roof. Mr. Williams never called out for help, fire officials said, and was probably killed when the roof collapsed.</p>
        <p>''The people who got out fortunately must have been closer to an exit,'' explained Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen, who was at the scene, ''and the person who got caught just didn't have a chance.''</p>
