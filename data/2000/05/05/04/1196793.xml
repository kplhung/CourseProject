        <p>The Marine Corps will resume test flights of the V-22 Osprey airplane, though it has not yet determined the precise cause of the Osprey crash last month in Arizona, which killed 19 soldiers, a Marine spokesman said today.</p>
        <p>The crash was the third involving an Osprey in the last decade, and provided new grist for critics who say the $44 million craft is unreliable and dangerous.</p>
        <p>Maj. Dave Lapan, the Marine spokesman, said investigators were satisfied that the craft was safe to continue testing.</p>
        <p>The flights are to resume Friday.</p>
