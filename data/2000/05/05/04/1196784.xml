        <p>BUSH SEEKS HELP -- Gov. George W. Bush of Texas reached out yesterday for an experienced Republican hand, Andrew H. Card Jr., to watch over Bush interests at this summer's national convention in Philadelphia. Mr. Card, vice president for governmental relations for the General Motors Corporation, worked in the White House under President George Bush as deputy chief of staff and later was transportation secretary. He is the second member of the elder Bush's cabinet to join the governor's political organization in recent weeks. The first was Richard B. Cheney, President Bush's defense secretary, who was chosen to run the governor's vice presidential search committee.</p>

        <p>THE ISSUES</p>
        <p>ABORTION RIGHTS ALERT -- The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League is promoting Vice President Al Gore with a television advertisement warning that if Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee, is elected president, he will appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion rights decision. The commercials also warn that Mr. Bush ''even supports a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion.'' Mr. Bush is on record as saying that he will appoint justices who will ''strictly interpret'' the Constitution. Kate Michelman, president of the league, says many pro-rights supporters have been lulled into thinking that the right to a legal abortion is secure when, in fact, it is in danger because two or more supporters may leave the court in the next administration.</p>

        <p>THE FAMILIES --REPORT ON FATAL CRASH -- Details in a 1963 accident report say that Laura Bush, then 17, ran a stop sign in the Texas crash that killed a friend in another car. The report, adding information to previous reports of the crash, was released yesterday. Mrs. Bush is the wife of the Republican presidential nominee-to-be George W. Bush, the Texas governor. The report said Laura Welch was driving her Chevrolet sedan on a clear night shortly after 8 p.m. on Nov. 6, 1963, when she drove into an intersection and struck a car driven by her friend, 17-year-old Michael Douglas. No charges were filed.</p>
