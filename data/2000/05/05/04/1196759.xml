        <p>HAROLD O. LEVY, the interim schools chancellor, wants to elevate the level of discourse at the Board of Education. He wants the seven board members and others who toil in the school system to get culture. Study the universe. Appreciate music. Read poetry.</p>

        <p>HAROLD O. LEVY, the interim schools chancellor, wants to elevate the level of discourse at the Board of Education. He wants the seven board members and others who toil in the school system to get culture. Study the universe. Appreciate music. Read poetry.</p>
        <p>''The notion is to change the areas of conversation, so that we are squarely confronting some of the great philosophical questions of our day,'' Mr. Levy told Abby Goodnough of The Times.</p>
        <p>Now that is one idealistic -- and optimistic -- aspiration for the seven board members, who, let us remember, are named by six different elected officials mainly for their political fit rather than their erudition. No surprise that one of the mayor's appointees, Ninfa Segarra, let it slip that she most enjoys reading mysteries about serial killers, not poems. No surprise, either, that boards often drive chancellors to distraction by meddling, micromanaging and dwelling on perks and patronage.</p>
        <p>The Board of Education and poetry? Frank Macchiarola, a former chancellor who is now president of St. Francis College in Brooklyn, laughed out loud. Board members could read Tennyson's ''The Charge of the Light Brigade,'' he suggested. ''It tells you what kind of world they are in.'' Tennyson's work celebrates the suicidal ''death charge'' of 600 British troops in the Crimea, in the mid-19th century: ''Into the valley of Death/Rode the six hundred/ Boldly they rode and well/Into the jaws of Death/Into the mouth of Hell/Rode the six hundred.''</p>
        <p>Randi Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, thought the board would enjoy Robert Frost. ''He wrote about good fences and good neighbors. I hope the chancellor believes good poems make good board members.''</p>
        <p>Or maybe, as they debate the decidedly nonpoetic issues of hiring teachers for summer school and negotiating a new contract with Ms. Weingarten's union, they could read about education in the near-poetic words of Finley Peter Dunne:</p>
        <p>'' 'D'ye think th' colledges has much to do with th' progress iv th' wurruld?' asked Mr. Hennessy. 'D'ye think,' said Mr. Dooley, ''tis th' mill that makes th' wather run?' ''</p>
        <p>Or about power and the fleeting nature of fame in the language of Shakespeare: ''Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,'' we learned in ''King Henry IV.'' And, from the 25th Sonnet: ''The painful warrior famoused for fight/After a thousand victories, once foiled/Is from the books of honor razed quite/And all the rest forgot for which he toiled.''</p>
        <p>To be fair, some welcome this poetry idea, take it almost as seriously as do Mr. Levy and his new executive assistant, Jonathan Levi, a musician, novelist and editor.</p>
        <p>Robert Pinsky, the poet laureate, noted yesterday that politics in New York often involved cultural issues. ''Poetry is a central force where those cultural issues can be worked out,'' said Mr. Pinsky. And Diane Ravitch, an education historian, called the chancellor's effort, ''the first step in taking back the system.'' She urged the board to read Oliver Wendell Holmes's ''The Height of the Ridiculous.''</p>
        <p>MOLLY PEACOCK, a founder of ''Poetry in Motion,'' which put poetry into the subways, also loves the idea. The board would benefit from Langston Hughes's ''Luck,'' she said: ''To some people/Love is given/To others/Only heaven,'' reads its last verse.</p>
        <p>''Ain't it the case for someone who gets to be on a school board, they don't know if it's a crumb or the bun?'' asked Ms. Peacock, who went on to suggest that Ms. Segarra, in particular, read Joseph Brodsky's ''Sir, You Are Tough.''</p>
        <p>The two-line poem reads: ''Sir, you are tough, and I am tough/But who will write whose epitaph?'' Explained Ms. Peacock: ''That's the challenge, O.K.? If you are a lover of serial killer mysteries, at the heart of that mystery is this idea of the contest. Of who's tougher, who's going to win. Think of how many kids out there in New York, how at the heart of their lives is these two lines.''</p>
        <p>Some of the board members thought the chancellor's idea insulting -- patronizing. Edward I. Koch, a former mayor, thought it a clever way to distract the board. Mr. Levy could have the seven read Virgil's ''Aeneid,'' which is in 12 books. ''It will keep them busy for at least three years,'' he said. ''Enough to get things done.''</p>
        <p>Or maybe Mr. Levy, named interim chancellor over Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's objection -- and now interested in the job full time -- may think that the music of words may help him outlast the lord of City Hall.</p>
        <p>He must be a fan of Joseph Brodsky.</p>
