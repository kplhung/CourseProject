        <p>The Giants signed Dawud Rasheed, a former fullback at Duke, and Kevin Prentiss, a former wide receiver-kick returner at Mississippi State, as free agents, the team announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>Rasheed, 23, who is 5 feet 10 inches and 226 pounds, spent last season in the Cleveland Browns' training camp before being released in August. Prentiss, also 23, who is 5-7 and 160 pounds, caught 38 passes for 681 yards and 3 touchdowns as a senior in 1998, then was cut by the Indianapolis Colts last Sept. 5.</p>
