        <p>Indian drummers need more than just fast hands. They also need prodigious memories to hold complex compositions and the system of rhythmic cycles that underlies classical improvisation, quick tongues to vocalize the percussive syllables they play and an ear for the remarkable tones and timbres they draw from instruments as basic as a hand drum or a clay jar. At Town Hall on Saturday night, the tabla master Zakir Hussain and six other Indian percussionists harnessed all those skills for a concert of spectacular rhythmic fireworks.</p>
        <p>The concert, presented by the World Music Institute, mixed pedagogy, playfulness, traditions and extrapolations. Mr. Hussain was the main soloist and the fulcrum for ensembles; he was also an erudite ringmaster, explaining the legendary or historical background of some rhythms and letting others fly.</p>

        <p>Indian drummers need more than just fast hands. They also need prodigious memories to hold complex compositions and the system of rhythmic cycles that underlies classical improvisation, quick tongues to vocalize the percussive syllables they play and an ear for the remarkable tones and timbres they draw from instruments as basic as a hand drum or a clay jar. At Town Hall on Saturday night, the tabla master Zakir Hussain and six other Indian percussionists harnessed all those skills for a concert of spectacular rhythmic fireworks.</p>
        <p>The concert, presented by the World Music Institute, mixed pedagogy, playfulness, traditions and extrapolations. Mr. Hussain was the main soloist and the fulcrum for ensembles; he was also an erudite ringmaster, explaining the legendary or historical background of some rhythms and letting others fly.</p>
        <p>He and his brother Fazal Qureshi, also on tabla, played a rhythm that had been commissioned by royalty when the first railways were built in India.</p>
        <p>It clattered, chugged, gathered steam and used high drum tones to whoop like a train whistle. Soon afterward, to show how drumming mimicked language, Mr. Hussain reeled off percussion syllables and gestured like a comical argument.</p>
        <p>There was melody, too. Mr. Hussain and Mr. Qureshi performed with Ustad Sultan Khan on sarangi, a bowed lute. The bridge of the sarangi, damaged in flight and hastily repaired, broke again while Mr. Khan was tuning. But he managed to play brilliantly on just one string. He performed a romantic raga with passages that sang like passionate masculine and feminine voices, then dug in with fast, rough-hewn lines suggesting a North Indian hoedown.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hussain's drumming was a marvel of time and texture. From his larger drum came low, hooting, sliding notes; from the smaller one came tones that resonated like plucked strings or pattered like sleet on a tin roof. It was as if Mr. Hussain controlled independent stampedes of notes in various registers: buffaloes below, centipedes above. And when he brought them together in a burst of acceleration, subdividing and syncopating the underlying rhythm, the drums roared like a Harley-Davidson kicked into gear.</p>
        <p>The other percussionists were just as dynamic. T. H. Vinayakram played ghatam, a pumpkin-size clay jar, making a seemingly unyielding instrument ping, clatter and hoot while he systematically subdivided the beat.</p>
        <p>Bhavani Shankar played the two-headed pakhawaj, the South Indian ancestor of the tabla, reciting the high-speed syllables of an intricate composition and bouncing his drum notes from octave to octave. Rajaram played brisk, folk-based rhythms from western India on the two-headed dholki drum.</p>
        <p>Taufiq Qureshi, also Mr. Hussain's brother, and Sivamani each played more eclectic setups. Mr. Qureshi used a singing bowl, a goblet-shaped Middle Eastern drum, cymbals, tabla and frame drums. Sivamani had rack upon rack of percussion from at least four continents; as he worked his way around them, tapping a beat with jingle bells around his shins, his rhythms traveled from India to New Orleans.</p>
