        <p>For its annual gala here on May 24, the Democratic Party is offering tickets ranging from an affordable $50 to a platinum price of $500,000, the highest amount either party has charged for admission to a fund-raising gala.</p>
        <p>The donors and fund-raisers who give or collect $500,000 will be given a package of perks that includes an invitation to a private dinner with President Clinton at a Washington restaurant on the eve of the gala and front-row seats, in the so-called ''platinum section'' of the MCI Center, for the gala's entertainment. The comedian Robin Williams leads the list, along with the musicians Stevie Wonder and Lenny Kravitz.</p>

        <p>For its annual gala here on May 24, the Democratic Party is offering tickets ranging from an affordable $50 to a platinum price of $500,000, the highest amount either party has charged for admission to a fund-raising gala.</p>
        <p>The donors and fund-raisers who give or collect $500,000 will be given a package of perks that includes an invitation to a private dinner with President Clinton at a Washington restaurant on the eve of the gala and front-row seats, in the so-called ''platinum section'' of the MCI Center, for the gala's entertainment. The comedian Robin Williams leads the list, along with the musicians Stevie Wonder and Lenny Kravitz.</p>
        <p>The gala is a tribute to Mr. Clinton, led by his close friend Terry McAuliffe, who offered last year to put up $1.35 million of his own money for the Clintons' house in Chappaqua, N.Y. The event features the widest gulf in donor levels ever seen at a political fund-raiser here.</p>
        <p>Prolific fund-raisers and generous donors will also be invited to attend a private reception with Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore before the gala.</p>
        <p>S. Daniel Abraham, the chairman of Slim-Fast Foods of West Palm Beach, Fla., recently wrote a check for $500,000, which the national committee deposited on May 1, party officials said today.</p>
        <p>At its black-tie gala last month, the Republicans raised a record-shattering $21.3 million, a sum composed mostly of large, unregulated checks of $100,000 or more. Nearly 50 Republican fund-raisers gave $250,000 each. And the Republicans have a big-money club of donors, known as the Regents, who each pay $250,000. The Democrats have their own big-money club: members of Leadership 2000 each give or collect $350,000.</p>
        <p>The sharp escalation of campaign contributions, or ''donation inflation,'' as some fund-raisers call it, has alarmed many who advocate changes in the campaign finance system, and they reacted with outrage today at the $500,000 fund-raising level established by the Democrats.</p>
        <p>''The spiraling obscenity of craven campaign finance efforts will not stop unless either the public's outrage starts being felt or corporations and special interests become sickened themselves and balk at paying these absurd amounts of money,'' said Peter Eisner, managing director of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit public watchdog group.</p>
        <p>Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, a public policy group that advocates campaign finance reform, said, ''This is crazy greed, and it would be shameful if there was any shame left in this city.''</p>
        <p>Democratic Party officials objected to the portrayal of the gala as a soft-money event.</p>
        <p>''This is a different kind of event meant to bring people from all walks of life to rally around the Democratic Party and the issues we stand for,'' said Jenny Backus, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee. ''It's very disappointing for these reformers, who know better, to try and put a pox on both of our houses, when it is very clear that the Democratic Party is the party that wants to reform the campaign finance system.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McAuliffe says he is trying to open the gala to thousands of young Democrats, who he says will pay $50 or $100 for tickets. The Democrats want to sell 14,000 arena tickets at prices from $50 to $1,000. And they have contrasted their event, which they say will encourage guests to wear blue jeans and cowboy boots, with the Republicans' black-tie affair last month in tribute to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the party's presumptive presidential nominee.</p>
        <p>But both have one thing in common: many checks of soft money, the large, unregulated contributions.</p>
        <p>The Republicans received large checks and fund-raising assistance from Phillip Morris and Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association.</p>
        <p>In recent months the Democrats have received $350,000 from SBC Communications, the telecommunications giant, and $250,000 checks from both Marc Andreessen, the founder of Netscape, and Mark B. Nathanson, a cable television mogul.</p>
        <p>''The money for this event is unbelievable,'' said one Democratic fund-raiser. ''It's all because of Terry. He could raise $25 million, or even $30 million, in one night. It will be the most successful Democratic event, by a factor of three.''</p>
