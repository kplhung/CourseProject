        <p>Trying to ease consumer fears about genetically engineered foods, the Food and Drug Administration announced yesterday that it would tighten its review of the products and develop guidelines for companies wanting to label them.</p>
        <p>The food and drug agency's announcement is part of a broader plan  by the Clinton administration that includes increased financing of studies on the potential risks of genetically engineered plants and a review of environmental regulations.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, the Department of Agriculture will also take steps that could lead to a system in which genetically engineered crops are kept separate from those that have not been altered. Now, the crops are commonly harvested together, which has caused some foreign importers to reject American crops.</p>
        <p>The measures were announced after the food and drug agency held  hearings on the growing concerns of consumers. Dr. Jane E. Henney, the commissioner of food and drugs, emphasized yesterday that ''F.D.A.'s scientific review continues to show that all bioengineered foods sold in the United States today are as safe as their nonbioengineered counterparts.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the agency said it would strengthen its policies and would write guidelines for companies that want to label foods that contain genetically engineered ingredients.</p>
        <p>But consumer groups said shoppers in American supermarkets were not likely to see much change. Most processed foods include genetically engineered ingredients, but that is not disclosed in labels.</p>
        <p>Jean Halloran, director of the Consumer Policy Institute at Consumers Union, said she feared that few food companies would label their foods because of the expense of meeting the government guidelines. ''This will make very little difference for consumers,'' Ms. Halloran said.</p>
        <p>To strengthen its policy, the food and drug agency also said yesterday that it would propose that biotechnology companies be required to talk to regulators about the safety of their new genetically engineered products at least 120 days before they are sold. That discussion is now voluntary.</p>
        <p>The nation's largest food companies had asked the administration for the change to help calm consumer fears.</p>
        <p>To ensure that regulators are also monitoring environmental risk, the Clinton administration said it planned to begin a six-month review of its current regulations.</p>
        <p>The Agriculture Department said yesterday that it planned to increase the $1.7 million it spends on research  into the crops.</p>
        <p>The department also said it would work with farmers and industry to create new systems for keeping genetically engineered crops separate.  It is already helping to create reliable tests for determining whether a truckload of grain includes genetically engineered varieties.</p>
