        <p>Lawyers for two men convicted in the death of a Hasidic scholar during the 1991 mob violence in Crown Heights challenged the verdict yesterday, questioning the trial judge's role in jury selection and the constitutionality of the federal law used to convict their clients.</p>
        <p>One of the defendants, Lemrick Nelson, was acquitted of state murder charges by a Brooklyn jury in 1992. In 1997, Mr. Nelson was convicted of violating the civil rights of the scholar, Yankel Rosenbaum, by stabbing him during a melee that followed the death of a boy struck by a car. His co-defendant, Charles Price, was convicted of violating federal civil rights laws by inciting a mob to violence.</p>
