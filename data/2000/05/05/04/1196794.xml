        <p>The Polaroid Corporation in Cambridge, Mass., has consolidated its worldwide account, with billings estimated at $100 million, at units of the B Com3  Group in Chicago.</p>
        <p>The account had been divided among agencies that include Bartle Bogle Hegarty in London, for European duties, and Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group, for the United States assignment, with billings estimated at $25 million to $30 million.</p>

        <p>The Polaroid Corporation in Cambridge, Mass., has consolidated its worldwide account, with billings estimated at $100 million, at units of the B Com3  Group in Chicago.</p>
        <p>The account had been divided among agencies that include Bartle Bogle Hegarty in London, for European duties, and Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group, for the United States assignment, with billings estimated at $25 million to $30 million.</p>
        <p>Last month, as Adweek reported that Polaroid wanted to consolidate the account, Bartle Bogle, which is 49 percent owned by B Com3 , enlisted the help of its larger sibling, the Leo Burnett Company.</p>
        <p>Skip Colcord, a spokesman for Polaroid, said that the company would have ''a multifaceted arrangement'' with B Com3. Burnett is expected to serve as the lead worldwide agency. Goodby, Silverstein was considered unlikely to prevail in the consolidation because another client, the Hewlett-Packard Company, sells digital photography products like Polaroid.</p>
