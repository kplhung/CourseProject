        <p>The $5 million bail for a man charged with murdering his former girlfriend on her wedding day was reduced to $1.5 million yesterday.</p>
        <p>After listening to opposing lawyers' sharply differing descriptions of whether the slaying of the woman, Gladys Ricart, was premeditated, Judge William C. Meehan of State Superior Court granted a defense request for the lower bail.</p>
        <p>Judge Meehan said the suspect, Agustin Garcia, 48, had satisfied several criteria for a reduction, including having an established home, a professional career, and no prior criminal record.</p>
        <p>Until the money is raised, Mr. Garcia will remain in the Bergen County Jail, where he has been held since he was charged with shooting Ms. Ricart, 39, as she posed for photographs with her bridal party in her Ridgefield, N.J., home on Sept. 26.</p>
        <p>During today's hearing, an assistant Bergen County prosecutor, James V. Santulli, asked Judge Meehan to leave the $5 million bail intact.  He argued that Mr. Garcia posed a threat to Ms. Ricart's family and might flee.</p>
