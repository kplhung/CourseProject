        <p>Take away the rubber masks, the numbers that its members use instead of names (0 through 8) and the unlikely hometown of Des Moines, and Slipknot is still an impressive band. Live, all nine members are constantly in motion, beating on metallic percussion, scratching records, grinding death-metal guitar riffs, scream-singing, and proving themselves  one of the most exciting and enigmatic of rock's current crop of new bands.</p>
        <p>Responding to a reporter's questions backstage at the Live Oak Civic Center outside San Antonio, Shawn Crahan, the band's clown-masked percussionist and founding father (a k a No. 6), gazed at a stack of yellow plastic drinking cups. He carefully set aside the top cup, then selected the cup below and emptied a can of Mountain Dew into it.</p>

        <p>Take away the rubber masks, the numbers that its members use instead of names (0 through 8) and the unlikely hometown of Des Moines, and Slipknot is still an impressive band. Live, all nine members are constantly in motion, beating on metallic percussion, scratching records, grinding death-metal guitar riffs, scream-singing, and proving themselves  one of the most exciting and enigmatic of rock's current crop of new bands.</p>
        <p>Responding to a reporter's questions backstage at the Live Oak Civic Center outside San Antonio, Shawn Crahan, the band's clown-masked percussionist and founding father (a k a No. 6), gazed at a stack of yellow plastic drinking cups. He carefully set aside the top cup, then selected the cup below and emptied a can of Mountain Dew into it.</p>
        <p>Why didn't you use the top cup?</p>
        <p>''Because someone could have come in and put something in the cup and just put it on top. I always take the second or third one down. And next time I'm going to take the sixth one down because I've just told you what I do. That's the way I work. People think I'm crazy. Maybe I am. But I know what's going on.</p>
        <p>''You know, I didn't know we were going to do an interview right this second. I told my wife I'd call right back when I saw you. She'll yell at me, but guess what? She'll get over it because she knows I'm on a mission, and nothing's going to get in my way.''</p>
        <p>What is that mission?</p>
        <p>''I am on a world-domination mission. Slipknot is not just an average band. It's not just music. It's a way of life and it's the real way of life. When I go out onstage, the rock 'n' roll cliche can go die. There's no place for that anymore. My whole deal is, when we've reached everyone and everyone understands, I'm gone. I'm out. I've done it. ''</p>
        <p>What are you trying to teach everyone?</p>
        <p>''We try not to talk about religion or politics. We tell the maggots, our fans, you can do what you want, just do it your way. We never have anything negative to say to you, so long as you're standing up for yourself.''</p>
