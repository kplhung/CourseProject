        <p>It was nearing 2 a.m. when a cloud of blue smoke rose from the stage. Bands of turquoise lights flitted through the murk, and the music switched abruptly from the normal fare of Latin salsa to the lugubrious melody of an old Arabic song.</p>
        <p>Out slithered a tall, broad-shouldered man, his eyes rimmed with black powder. He did a little shoulder shimmy and teasingly flicked a hip toward the audience.</p>

        <p>It was nearing 2 a.m. when a cloud of blue smoke rose from the stage. Bands of turquoise lights flitted through the murk, and the music switched abruptly from the normal fare of Latin salsa to the lugubrious melody of an old Arabic song.</p>
        <p>Out slithered a tall, broad-shouldered man, his eyes rimmed with black powder. He did a little shoulder shimmy and teasingly flicked a hip toward the audience.</p>
        <p>''Please welcome,'' the emcee shouted from somewhere in the shadows beyond the spectacle, ''the one and only Mousbah!''</p>
        <p>It was belly dancing night in the Amor y Libertad nightclub in northern Beirut. And Mousbah Baalbaki, quite possibly the only male belly dancer performing regularly in public in the Arab world, was about to tweak tradition to the delight of his adoring fans and the discomfort of many others.</p>
        <p>''Anybody can shake his body and get money,'' Mr. Baalbaki said in an interview before his show. ''But to me dancing is an art.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baalbaki, who is 28, does not perform a transvestite show or a striptease. It is more like ''Saturday Night Fever'' meets ''The Thousand and One Nights.'' Sinuous and seductive, dressed one recent Friday night in a gauzy black caftan over a Bedouin-style white robe, he undulated on stage with a faraway look in his eyes and a bodyguard close at hand.</p>
        <p>''If he wasn't an artist, he would have been arrested long ago,'' said Michel Elefteriades, the nightclub owner and Mr. Baalbaki's promoter.</p>
        <p>He offered a simple explanation for why he represents a male belly dancer in a country that, for all its worldly glitter, still has a generous streak of religious conservatism and criminalizes homosexuality.</p>
        <p>''I'm always looking to shock,'' Mr. Elefteriades said.</p>
        <p>That is not always an easy task.</p>
        <p>Beirut is a paradoxical town, with European designer boutiques interspersed with the sniper-shattered buildings from the 15-year civil war and Shiite Muslim militants hobnobbing with urbane Christians and Sunni Muslims in the halls of power.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Baalbaki's public gyrations seem a step beyond the pale even for Beirut.</p>
        <p>''This is a real taboo,'' the dancer confided. ''In our culture, people look down even on women who dance professionally, so they look down on me even more. Every weekend I struggle with the audience.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, many of the men in the Amor y Libertad seemed to squirm and concentrate resolutely on their drinks when Mr. Baalbaki took the stage. But their dates did not seem discomfited at all. Although Mr. Baalbaki does not like it -- he is there, he explained, to be watched, not to be a background novelty act -- quite a few young women lost themselves in their own versions of belly dancing as he performed.</p>
        <p>''I can dance to any kind of music,'' he said, ''but with an Arabic song, it comes from my heart.''</p>
        <p>And his abs, among other body parts.</p>
        <p>There is a long tradition of male teachers of belly dancing in Arab countries. But men who perform the flirtatious movements, at least in mixed company, are rare.</p>
        <p>And not only rare but bogus, in the view of Fifi Abdo, the leading lady of Egyptian belly dancing, who describes herself as the only living symbol of the art.</p>
        <p>''A man belly-dancing?'' she exclaimed in a telephone interview from Cairo. ''They can do the folk dances, but it's impossible for a man to dance real belly dancing. The phrase itself describes the part from the hips to the waist, and a man lacks the energy there that a woman has. They can perform, but they can't belly-dance.''</p>
        <p>An Egyptian man who had undergone a sex change operation danced onstage for a while in Cairo a few years ago, causing a major stir before disappearing from public view. One Istanbul nightclub offers a male belly-dancing show.</p>
        <p>But whether people are ready for it yet is an unanswered question.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baalbaki has not told his parents that he belly-dances, much less that he belly-dances in public. And Mr. Elefteriades's own father, who is a theatrical promoter, has expressed profound reservations about his son's association with a male belly dancer.</p>
        <p>That annoys Mr. Elefteriades, who considers himself a warrior in a larger fight against social conservatism. ''I don't think it makes sense that men in a lot of countries, like Greece, dance to their own music,'' he said, ''while the Arabs only clap their hands while women dance.''</p>
        <p>He wants to make Mr. Baalbaki a big star -- that is how he put it -- and is preparing a music video for distribution on Arab satellite stations that shows his client dancing but without the usual makeup and flamboyant costume. He is weighing the pros and cons of allowing Mr. Baalbaki to accept an invitation to a talk show on a Lebanese television station.</p>
        <p>The world outside Beirut also beckons. ''I think there's a real interest in Orientalism,'' Mr. Elefteriades said. ''There's always a flavor that's popular, and now it's the Middle East.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baalbaki was just another club kid, dancing his nights away in Beirut's many bars, when he was discovered by Mr. Elefteriades and signed to a seven-year contract that prohibits him from freelance dancing and from gaining weight.</p>
        <p>He did not have formal training, picking up his moves instead from watching hours of the old Egyptian movies of the 1940's and 50's that always featured a voluptuous belly dancer as the centerpiece. He can be mesmerized by his favorite, the late Takiya Karyoka, whose dancing is still considered to have set the modern standard.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baalbaki is handling the celebrity of his nascent stardom -- the squealing young women who haunt his dressing room, for example -- pretty easily. ''All my life, I've enjoyed being a celebrity,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It is the taunts, the hostility and even the thrown objects that he sometimes runs into that bother him. So he is keeping his day job as the fashion editor of a glossy Lebanese magazine and tries to maintain a regal indifference to the occasional insults.</p>
        <p>''When he walks, no matter what people say, it doesn't touch him,'' Mr. Elefteriades said in admiration. Then he quoted a line from the Lebanese philosopher-poet Khalil Gibran to explain what he meant: ''The dogs bark, but the caravan moves on.''</p>
