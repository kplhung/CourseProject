        <p>At the company's new site, 75,000 United States sales representatives can create personal home pages using preformatted designs. Besides listing Tupperware parties and Tupperware bingos, the personal pages can include Tupperware testimonials and recipes.</p>
        <p>If users click through from the personal home pages to shop on Tupperware's corporate e-commerce site, the sales representative receives the usual 20 percent commission on everything they buy.</p>
        <p>Tupperware is not giving up on its usual sales method. ''We're not looking to replace the party with anything else,'' said Christine Hanneman, the company's vice president for financial relations and treasury. ''We're looking to enhance it.''</p>
