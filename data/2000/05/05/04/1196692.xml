        <p>Corbis, the image archive company owned by William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, is adding to its collection yet again. The company announced today that it planned to put online thousands of digital images owned by Christie's, the art auction house.</p>
        <p>The Christie's images include all the works that have been sold through the auction house in the last 20 years: more than 500,000 transparencies, ranging from Asian and African art to Old Master paintings, and from modern and contemporary art to Hollywood memorabilia. The non-exclusive licensing arrangement between the two firms will provide Corbis's customers with a selection of those images via www.corbis.com.</p>

The non-exclusive licensing arrangement between the two firms will provide Corbis's customers with a selection of those images via www.corbis.com.</p>
        <p>Corbis, based in Seattle, already owns and licenses 65 million images, including the Bettman Archive. Last June, the company acquired Sygma, one of the world's largest news photography agencies. Nonexclusive licensing agreements like the one announced today with Christie's already exist with the Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust, the National Gallery of London and the Hermitage in St. Petersburg. To date, Corbis has put some 2.1 million images online, which it sells to publishers and consumers over the Internet.</p>
