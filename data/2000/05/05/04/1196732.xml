        <p>From a Mock Trial To a Real Lawsuit</p>
        <p>Broadway in the morning, a press conference in the afternoon, a conference call in the evening: JOHNNIE COCHRAN said yesterday was just another day.</p>
        <p>It began at the Shubert Theater. He gave a speech to 1,700 high school students and watched a mock trial of Beaulah Annan, on whose life the musical ''Chicago'' was based. Everyone handed in paper ballots. He voted not guilty, but the students convicted her.</p>
        <p>At the afternoon press conference, Mr. Cochran joined the family of Patrick M. Dorismond -- an unarmed man killed in a scuffle with undercover police officers in March -- to announce the filing of the initial stage of a $100 million civil lawsuit against New York City. The filing, formally known as a notice of claim, accuses Detective Anthony Vasquez of acting negligently in the shooting, violating Mr. Dorismond's civil rights and wrongfully causing his death.</p>
        <p>The filing was unusual because it named MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI as being personally liable for actions he took after the shooting. Mr. Cochran said that Mr. Giuliani was named in the lawsuit because he destroyed Mr. Dorismond's reputation by releasing his sealed arrest and juvenile records to the public.</p>
        <p>''He said no to drugs, he was unarmed and yet he was killed, and then in death, he was slandered,'' Mr. Cochran said. A call to the mayor's press office was not returned; OFFICER GUY BRAUN, a police spokesman, said the department did not comment on pending cases.</p>
        <p>Remarriage Plans For Ex-Speaker</p>
        <p>NEWT GINGRICH, the combative conservative who orchestrated the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 and angrily stepped down four years later, plans to marry a Congressional aide with whom he had an affair while he was House speaker, his lawyer said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The lawyer, RANDY EVANS of Atlanta, said that Mr. Gingrich would marry CALLISTA BISEK on Aug. 18 in Alexandria, Va. Ms. Bisek, an aide to the House Agriculture Committee, said in a deposition for Mr. Gingrich's divorce trial that their affair began in 1993. The divorce became final several months ago, Mr. Evans said.</p>
        <p>Hard Reality On Soft Money</p>
        <p>THEODORE W. KHEEL called it quits yesterday, giving up his effort to persuade the campaigns of Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rudolph W. Giuliani to stop taking soft-money contributions.</p>
        <p>''I am throwing in the towel in the belief that it's just not possible to achieve campaign reform through the voluntary agreement of the participants, as much as they claim to be in favor of it,''  Mr. Kheel, the longtime New York labor mediator, said last night. ''I would say a plague on both your houses.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kheel had been trying to get the two campaigns to negotiate a voluntary ban on the largely unregulated contributions known as soft money. He had a few conversations with aides to the two candidates, but he said that as time went by, he concluded that neither campaign was interested. ''You can take a horse to water, but you can't make it drink,'' he said. ''In this case, I couldn't even get the horse to the water.''</p>
        <p>Some New Roles For a President</p>
        <p>L. JAY OLIVA, the president of New York University, has been rehearsing, but not for the usual end-of-the-academic-year commencement speeches.</p>
        <p>On Monday, he and KITTY CARLISLE HART will sing ''I Remember It Well'' from ''Gigi'' after he collects an award from the Broadway Theater Institute. On Tuesday, he will appear with ALEC BALDWIN at the graduation ceremony of the Tisch School of the Arts at N.Y.U., which will be held at Carnegie Hall. They will be the readers in ''Desiderata,'' a choral work by RALPH AFFOUMADO, director of the Tisch All-School Choir.</p>
        <p>''We stand on each side and say the words,'' Dr. Oliva said. ''The only key is, you've got to match the words to where the kids are singing. It took me three days to figure out. It took Alec Baldwin 30 seconds, which tells you the difference between the pros and the wannabes. I was listening to him and saying 'Wow,' and somebody's telling me, 'You just missed your cue.' ''</p>
