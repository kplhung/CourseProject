        <p>Miles Joseph, a midfielder who was one of the last original members of the MetroStars, was traded to the Columbus Crew yesterday for a second-round draft pick next year.</p>
        <p>Joseph, 26, appeared in three games this season. He had 10 goals and 22 assists in 96 career games, and his departure leaves Tab Ramos as the only player remaining from the inaugural 1996 season.</p>
