        <p>The euro fell to new lows against the dollar and other major currencies today, settling below 90 cents for the first time.</p>
        <p>The plight of the euro has become a source of embarrassment to European political leaders and of bewilderment to currency traders. At today's late price in New York of 89.61 cents, compared with 90.73 cents on Tuesday, it is more than 23 percent below its value at its introduction in January 1999. And after alternating periods of market softness, followed by interim stability, the euro has declined anew in recent weeks, falling at an accelerated pace over the last several days.</p>

        <p>The euro fell to new lows against the dollar and other major currencies today, settling below 90 cents for the first time.</p>
        <p>The plight of the euro has become a source of embarrassment to European political leaders and of bewilderment to currency traders. At today's late price in New York of 89.61 cents, compared with 90.73 cents on Tuesday, it is more than 23 percent below its value at its introduction in January 1999. And after alternating periods of market softness, followed by interim stability, the euro has declined anew in recent weeks, falling at an accelerated pace over the last several days.</p>
        <p>The reasons for the common currency's decline remain murky. The most obvious source of pressure continues to be the strength of the United States economy, which is growing faster than those in Europe and has been a magnet for capital. Moreover, the dollar's value has been pushed up by expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates -- a step that ordinarily increases the exchange rate of a currency.</p>
        <p>But analysts note that the euro has also been losing ground to other currencies. It has fallen further against the Japanese yen than against the dollar, and declined as well against the British pound and the Swiss franc.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the strength of the dollar explains everything that is going on,'' said Joachim Scheide, an economist at the Institute of World Economics in Kiel, Germany. ''This is a problem of euro weakness.''</p>
        <p>By most measures, economic growth and optimism in the 11-nation euro zone are stronger than they have been in years. Growth is expected to exceed 3 percent in 2000, price rises are more modest than in the United States, exports are booming, and even unemployment -- in the last few years Europe's intractable problem -- is declining markedly.</p>
        <p>Despite all that, currency traders have begun talking about ''panic sales'' of euros in recent days. One reason is that international fund managers had been betting on a strong increase in the euro. When the currency defied their expectations and declined further, many institutions were caught with low-value euros that they are now selling every time the rate creeps up a bit.</p>
        <p>It probably did not help the single currency that the European Commission and European Central Bank recommended that Greece, rejected for entry into the monetary union two years ago, should now be allowed to join. But analysts said that the decision on Greece probably had little real effect, as most considered it a foregone conclusion.</p>
        <p>In recent days, some specialists have begun to blame the central bank and European political leaders for making the problem worse. When the euro was introduced, central bank officials indicated that they had little interest in the day-to-day movements of exchange rates, but were concerned about signs of inflation.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, central bankers have changed their position and made it clear that they are now worried that the euro's weakness could ignite inflation by pushing up the prices of imported goods.</p>
        <p>That was the main reason that the European Central Bank gave last week when it raised its benchmark short-term interest rate to 3.75 percent from 3.5 percent -- a move that did not stop the euro from sinking immediately afterward.</p>
        <p>Christian Noyer, the bank's vice president, said in a speech today that the euro's slide ''puts pressure on price stability,'' and most analysts expect more rate increases in the near future.</p>
        <p>But most of Europe's central bankers remain convinced that intervening in markets to prop up the euro would be fruitless.</p>
        <p>''It's very doubtful whether intervention can be successful against the market trend,'' said Ernst Welteke, president of Germany's central bank, in remarks carried by Bloomberg News. ''If one looks, for example, at current U.S. interests,'' Mr. Welteke added, ''it's unlikely that concerted intervention is even possible.''</p>
