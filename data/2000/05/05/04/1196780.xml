        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Kimberly Stevens didn't address the important environmental issue for curtains in ''Late-Late Show, Starring Your Neighbors.'' Curtains keep out the sunlight -- thus less energy is used for air-conditioning in the summer -- and curtains keep out drafts in the winter.</p>
        <p>The folks going sans window coverings obviously are insensitive to these issues, or perhaps they're so hot from titillating the neighbors, they've taken leave of all senses.</p>

        <p>Kimberly Stevens didn't address the important environmental issue for curtains in ''Late-Late Show, Starring Your Neighbors.'' Curtains keep out the sunlight -- thus less energy is used for air-conditioning in the summer -- and curtains keep out drafts in the winter.</p>
        <p>The folks going sans window coverings obviously are insensitive to these issues, or perhaps they're so hot from titillating the neighbors, they've taken leave of all senses.</p>
        <p>Once, when the citizens of New York were not hedonistic consumers of energy, buildings had awnings in the summer to protect the curtains from fading and to keep the inhabitants cool. Now, it's cool, Ms. Stevens says, not to care -- part of the dumbing down of all aspects of city life, so forget about the ''old fashioned'' response for covering windows.</p>
        <p>We're the richest country on earth, and we'll make love in front of uncovered windows if we want. Heat turned up and the A.C. blasting.</p>
