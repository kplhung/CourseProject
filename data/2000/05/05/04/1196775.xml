        <p>Helped by a surprisingly strong response from Hispanics and other minorities, the Census Bureau has halted a long slide in response rates and received answers from nearly two-thirds of the households that got a census form in the mail this year.</p>
        <p>Preliminary figures from the agency show that despite widespread complaints about its questionnaires, especially the long form received by a sixth of all households, 65.9 percent of all households replied as of April 30. Census officials estimate that the final response rate may be as high as 67 percent, compared with a mail-back rate of 65 percent in 1990.</p>

        <p>Helped by a surprisingly strong response from Hispanics and other minorities, the Census Bureau has halted a long slide in response rates and received answers from nearly two-thirds of the households that got a census form in the mail this year.</p>
        <p>Preliminary figures from the agency show that despite widespread complaints about its questionnaires, especially the long form received by a sixth of all households, 65.9 percent of all households replied as of April 30. Census officials estimate that the final response rate may be as high as 67 percent, compared with a mail-back rate of 65 percent in 1990.</p>
        <p>Though small, the improvement over 1990 represents the reversal of a three-decade decline in the proportion of American households that have returned the questionnaire. In 1970, 83 percent of households receiving the forms responded; in 1980, 75 percent did so. And the improvement occurs as other indices of civic engagement, like voting and volunteer work, have been in steep declines.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure some of this mobilization to get people to fill out their forms was about how you help your communities,'' Kenneth Prewitt, the census director, said. ''That's a positive sign when you get people to take responsibility for their communities. It's a foundation to try to do something about the cynicism and indifference that we all complain about.''</p>
        <p>The new figures provide powerful evidence of the effectiveness of a vigorous advertising campaign the agency mounted to persuade a jaded and skeptical public to fill out the forms. The campaign has been heavily directed toward minorities and focused on the advantages of increasing census tallies, which are used to steer many federal programs to local communities.</p>
        <p>Polling data indicate that households heavily exposed to the bureau's marketing effort were much more likely to send back the form, even though these same households were more prone to consider the questions an invasion of their privacy.</p>
        <p>As has always been the case, neighborhoods and states whose residents tended to be overwhelmingly white still had a higher response rate than those areas with more members of minorities.</p>
        <p>But census data show that areas where the majority of households are African-American held their own and that census tracts where Hispanic residents are the majority or where no ethnic or racial group is more than 50 percent sharply improved their performance over 1990.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Census Bureau figures indicate that the biggest declines in participation occurred in areas whose residents were largely white or Asian-American.</p>
        <p>For example, California, where racial and ethnic minorities make up nearly half of the population, posted the biggest growth in response, rising to 68 percent this year, compared with 65 percent in 1990.</p>
        <p>But Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin -- which have relatively few minorities -- all saw sharp declines in the number of households that returned census questionnaires.</p>
        <p>''To oversimplify things, in terms of response rates, whites performed slightly less well than they did in 1990; Hispanics and blacks outperformed their 1990 experience,'' said Steve Jost, the Census Bureau's associate director for communications.</p>
        <p>The high rates of response is a welcome relief to census officials, whose original projections anticipated a response rate of 61 percent. The five percentage points of higher response will save the bureau millions of dollars because it will need fewer census takers to visit the homes of residents who did not mail back their forms. Census takers have already begun making those visits.</p>
        <p>Census officials cautioned that the results were based on a compilation of the mail that the bureau has received back. Those forms have not yet been read to determine if they were fully completed. Any household that did not complete its form will still be visited by a census taker.</p>
        <p>The performance should quiet some of the bureau's critics, who have expressed concerns about its ability to carry out the census. But it will do little if anything to quell the debate about the use of statistical sampling methods to correct for a potential undercount.</p>
        <p>Information on response rates among states comes from publicly available data listed on the Census Bureau's World Wide Web site (www.census.gov). Data on the response from different ethnic and racial groups come from bureau's internal analysis of returns from the country's more than 61,000 census tracts -- neighborhoods each containing roughly 4,000 residents -- that was provided to The New York Times.</p>
        <p>Census Bureau officials emphasized that some figures were preliminary and subject to change, though they added that they doubted that any changes would alter the overall conclusions very much.</p>
        <p>Much of the improvement is due to the determined effort to increase the response rate in California.</p>
        <p>Early in the planning process, census officials estimated that 58 percent of the households in the state that received a form would mail it back. But state officials mounted a major campaign that included appropriating $24 million to raise the response rate.</p>
        <p>By April 4 -- the latest date for detailed figures -- the response rate for California was 68 percent, more than 1.4 million households than original estimates.</p>
        <p>''We're just delighted,'' said Linda Gage, the state's official demographer. ''Only 12 states had better mail response rates than we did and only Massachusetts, which is much smaller, exceed our improvement in mail response rate.''</p>
        <p>Census Bureau officials did not offer any theories for the racial and ethnic differences in response rates. But a Menlo Park, Calif., polling company hired by a number of foundations to assess the bureau's outreach efforts has produced data indicating that the bureau's marketing and advertising campaign resonated much more strongly among minorities than it did with whites.</p>
        <p>The polling company, InterSurvey, found that 31 percent of the African-American and 33 percent of the Hispanic households it surveyed said they had ''high levels'' of exposure to the bureau's campaign, compared with 16 percent of white households.</p>
