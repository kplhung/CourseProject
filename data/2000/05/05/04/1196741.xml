        <p>I'LL show you the fun part, just 'cause it's fun,'' Abby Rosin, the dance teacher who's just gotten an award for her work with kids and who sounds like a kid herself, is saying.</p>
        <p>It's nice to have an offer of fun after you've walked up three steep and dramatically angled flights of stairs, and not often that one gets an offer of fun in the kitchen of a funky railroad apartment in the East Village, so by all means, Ms. Rosin, hit us.</p>

        <p>I'LL show you the fun part, just 'cause it's fun,'' Abby Rosin, the dance teacher who's just gotten an award for her work with kids and who sounds like a kid herself, is saying.</p>
        <p>It's nice to have an offer of fun after you've walked up three steep and dramatically angled flights of stairs, and not often that one gets an offer of fun in the kitchen of a funky railroad apartment in the East Village, so by all means, Ms. Rosin, hit us.</p>
        <p>Old metal cabinets are flung open, as Ms. Rosin, 27, a trim package of energy, a suburban girl not of this neighborhood, does an enthusiastic commentary.</p>
        <p>''My files,'' says Ms. Rosin, meaning the files for her nonprofit dance school, Groove With Me, which are sharing space with the oat bran.</p>
        <p>''Tap shoes,'' she says, throwing open another cabinet door. ''I used to carry them back and forth to class with me.''</p>
        <p>She turns to a stack of costumes in a spot in the kitchen where other people would put their coffeemaker.</p>
        <p>''Design Works in Ludlow, Mass., donated like $1,700 worth of clothes last year,'' Ms. Rosin says, holding up one of the gauzy gold T-shirts. ''It's good for the girls to have costumes that are totally different from jeans and T-shirt. They're little starlets, little divas.''</p>
        <p>''Diva,'' in this case, is a good thing, applying as it does to city girls who may not have had the opportunity to feel special before. Ms. Rosin has been giving them that chance with Groove With Me, which offers free dance classes. For that work, she has just been named the American winner of the Montblanc de la Culture Arts Patronage Award, which is given to 11 people a year worldwide and carries a $15,000 payment. Last year's American winner was David Robinson, center of the San Antonio Spurs basketball team, for a $5 million gift to a local arts organization. Other winners have been Susan Sontag and Jane Alexander.</p>
        <p>At 27, Ms. Rosin is the youngest person to receive the award, and perhaps -- if you don't count her upper middle class background -- the poorest. On paper, the budget for Groove With Me is $100,000, and Ms. Rosin's salary is $36,000. In reality, the school operates on about $10,000 a year and in borrowed studios. Ms. Rosin does not take a salary, and she pays many of the expenses herself, with money she received from a lawsuit after a car accident. It was only $52,000, she says, but it was ''well invested.''</p>
        <p>I'VE done four fund-raisers,'' says Ms. Rosin, now settled in her living room, on the graduate student couch, near a vase with two faded roses, each with a wisp of pastel ribbon.</p>
        <p>If she's supporting this program on her own money, it doesn't look as if she's raising funds very well, she is told.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rosin concurs at once.</p>
        <p>''I'm not good at everything,'' she says, in the tone of one who has spent a little time making peace with this. ''In designing the program, I'm really, really good. I'm a really, really good dance teacher. I'm really, really good with the kids. I might not be so good a grant writer. I might not be so good asking people for money. I'm not good at that, I admit.''</p>
        <p>Thirteen foster children in two years -- that's the number of kids Ms. Rosin remembers her mother caring for when she was growing up in the prosperous Westchester County town of Chappaqua. Ms. Rosin's father was a lawyer who often worked with foster children; her mother loved babies. Of Ms. Rosin's four siblings, two are adopted. Maybe, Ms. Rosin will eventually say, it is not so wonderful when your mother takes in so many babies -- it can make her own children wonder why they are not enough.</p>
        <p>Still, community service comes naturally to Ms. Rosin. At 13 she worked at a camp for disabled children, in high school she went to Kenya with a group of teenagers to help build a school. She studied dance, but in her senior year in high school, she badly broke a leg in a car accident. She is not certain she would have been a professional anyway -- the volunteerism impulse was too strong.</p>
        <p>At Brown, planning a career in international health, Ms. Rosin majored in health and society. Then, one summer during college, she worked as a counselor at a Fresh Air Fund camp upstate in Fishkill.</p>
        <p>''It opened up my eyes,'' she says. ''You don't have to go to Ethiopia to feed the hungry; there's enough stuff going on in your own backyard. These kids,'' -- she pauses, has something important to say, wants to get it right -- ''there was innocence, juxtaposed with having seen much, much more than I would ever see: a 9-year-old kid tells us about being molested by her stepfather. One kid lost a bathing suit and she said, 'Now my mom's going to hit me' -- with a knife, that was our understanding.''</p>
        <p>She started Groove With Me four years ago. It's for girls only, Ms. Rosin says, because there are fewer such facilities for girls.</p>
        <p>And those roses near the sofa, by the way?</p>
        <p>A performance with 22 of her students last weekend, at her old high school in Chappaqua. At the end of the show, her mother gave every child a rose, tied with a bit of ribbon. Which prompts a story.</p>
        <p>''Want to hear something?'' Ms. Rosin asks. ''Afterwards, one of the girls said, 'Do we get to keep these?'  Is that the saddest? She thought maybe it was a prop or something and it had to go back. No one had ever given her a rose.''</p>
