        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush's plan to allow people to put their Social Security in the stock market (front page, May 1) is ill advised. I don't consider Social Security to be my main retirement income, but a fallback, in case the stock market doesn't do well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush seems to want to change my portfolio mix arbitrarily without my consent. He would be better advised to see to it that the current system stays in place. I want some of my retirement to be ''risk free.''</p>
