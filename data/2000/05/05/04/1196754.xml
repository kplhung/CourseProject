        <p>The Los Angeles Lakers were Hollywood's version of a motion picture meteor hurtling toward earth with nothing but doom in the forecast for any mortal.</p>
        <p>But this week, the Sacramento Kings yelled ''Cut!'' With slingshots and kryptonite, they have left the once invincible Los Angeles Lakers one game removed from elimination in the first-round of the National Basketball Association playoffs.</p>
        <p>So, they can be beat. So, what? Although the Knicks and Heat are on the opposite coast, there was a hint more hope in their hearts for a title a day after the Kings forced a Game 5 in Los Angeles with their victory Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''If the Lakers ain't there, and we are?'' one Knick mused after practice today at SUNY-Purchase. ''Then, we've got a heck of a chance.''</p>
        <p>The odds seem better for everyone if Shaquille O'Neal is on vacation before mid-May, if Kobe Bryant is sitting at home swilling shots of Sprite, if Phil Jackson is in Montana whipping around a fly rod. And yet, it's still a big ''if.''</p>
        <p>''I don't think there is a possibility,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said when asked if the Lakers could be knocked out. ''That's just me. But, of course, there is a chance. It's maybe the closest anyone will get because it's always easier to do it in a five-game series.''</p>
        <p>The Lakers' fall is a tantalizing prospect for teams like the Heat and Knicks, both of whom were emphatically dismissed this season by a couple as famous but different as Jack Sprat and his wife: O'Neal and his wispy co-star, Bryant. With power and finesse, the Lakers' duo have dominated.</p>
        <p>Now, they look vulnerable. Even if the Lakers survive, they will not be viewed with the same awe. Just two weeks ago, Van Gundy said: ''I think there is certainly a form of intimidation by them. I know when we played them, we didn't have the same belief we have against a lot of teams.''</p>
        <p>Belief was in the air today. With four days before the Knicks and Heat face each other in Game 1 of the four-of-seven-game second-round series, there was time to ponder recent events.</p>
        <p>At Heat practice, Coach Pat Riley used the exit of the Tim Duncan-less Spurs and the struggles of the Lakers and Indiana Pacers as a motivational reminder for his players. In the span of 48 hours, Riley noted that the defending champions were gone, the Pacers were faced with a Game 5 and the Lakers were, too.</p>
        <p>''I made the point that the world championship is wide open,'' Riley said. ''There is not one team left that has ever experienced one. We're all starting from an equal basis that way. And so it's out there to take. The two No. 1 seeds in each conference are fighting for their lives. That's a testimony to the kind of constant that's out there. Teams are going after it.</p>
        <p>''I mean, the Lakers were far and away the best team in the regular season, and they showed the dominance. But there are some teams that have gotten so close, you just don't know how much the pulse is pounding right now.''</p>
        <p>Imagine the heart rates in the league office. With television ratings already plunging like Alka-Seltzer tablets plopped in water, the league's cover team is in trouble.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure they want to see their marquee team in jeopardy,'' Riley said. ''But we'll find out on the foul calls on Friday.''</p>
        <p>As everyone in the room broke out in laughter, Riley added that he was ''just kidding.'' But there is no doubt the Lakers have already had their myth tarnished a bit. Usually too cool and calm to call timeouts, even Jackson looked rattled during Game 4 in Sacramento, as he tried to prod his team through their 101-88 loss.</p>
        <p>''They failed -- not just 'jury's out,' they failed in their first test,'' Jackson said after Game 4. ''But this team doesn't have to do anything but win their home games to win the championship. That's the reality.''</p>
        <p>Perceptions of the Lakers have changed, though. Today, the Knicks promised that they weren't focused on anyone but the Heat, but they were much freer than they have been in the past to talk about their chances if the finals should bring them face to face with the Lakers -- or any other team from the West.</p>
        <p>''For teams who didn't believe they could beat the Lakers, they can say, Man, they can be beaten,'' Allan Houston said. ''That's my view on that. We feel like we can beat anybody when we play the right way.</p>
        <p>''We know if a good team doesn't play their best, they're going to look very vulnerable.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>TIM HARDAWAY's availability for Game 1 is still uncertain, but he appears to be working his way back into game shape. Tired of speculation surrounding Hardaway's foot injury and playing status, PAT RILEY, who ordered his team not to discuss the issue, gave in just a bit. ''The guy we can't talk about did some running today and got up a pretty good sweat,'' Riley said. ''But that's all I'm going to talk about on the guy I can't talk about.'' Hardaway added: ''It's slowly, slowly coming back. It hurts a little bit, but we'll go from there. I can feel the progress.'' . . . On Tuesday, PATRICK EWING said ALONZO MOURNING was the ''best center in the East -- next to me.'' JEFF VAN GUNDY had this to say on the subject: ''I believe Patrick has played great, but I don't think any player that plays great needs to tell people they have played great. I think he feels that way. He was giving an honest answer to an honest question. You can't begrudge him that.''</p>
