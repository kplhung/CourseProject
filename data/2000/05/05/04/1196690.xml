        <p>Brett Vapnek sits at the computer in his Beverly Hills office, zooming in on a map of the United States filled with clusters of black dots. Each dot represents a ZIP Code inhabited by a youth volunteer for the Streetwise Concepts and Culture street team, a fan volunteer network that assembled over the Internet for grassroots promotion for new rock bands.</p>
        <p>''I can zero in on the broadcast range for K-Rock, click a button to send an email, and get hundreds of kids to call the station and request 'Spiders' by System of a Down,'' Mr. Vapnek, the company's vice president, explained.</p>
        <p>Look outside any new rock show, and chances are you'll see a couple of Streetwise kids toting cardboard boxes full of cassettes of Slipknot, Papa Roach, Taproot, or another band that Streetwise represents. A slightly more sophisticated version of rap's street promotion teams, Streetwise sends its volunteers tapes, stickers and flyers to give to their friends or hand out in the street to generate excitement about a band.</p>
        <p>The street team concept began for when he was managing System of a Down. He would hang out in Internet chat rooms and give teenagers his home phone number. When they called, Beno would play them System of a Down's demo tape over the phone, then make a copy, wrap it in Kleenex, and send it to the lucky or confused teen. Eventually, he insisted that System's record label, Columbia, make him 30,000 advance cassettes; Streetwise began when the album's initial sales surprised not just Columbia but the band itself..</p>
        <p>''I start at the bottom and work up,'' Beno said. ''I inject the streets. There's no price you can put on word of mouth.''</p>
        <p>For Streetwise members, there's another benefit. ''Everybody's always grateful when I give them free tapes,'' said Julian Trevino, a college freshman, who was distributing Ultraspank cassettes outside the San Antoni concert by Slipknot, a band that Mr. Trevino, by the way, discovered when someone gave him a Streetwise cassette sampler of the band.</p>
