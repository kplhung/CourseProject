        <p>In both the Republican and Democratic parties, the presidential primaries this year were intense, competitive and, as a practical matter, over very quickly. Especially on the Republican side, there was a feeling that a more leisurely schedule would have given voters a better chance to think about the dramatic contrasts in style and message presented by Gov. George W. Bush and Senator John McCain. Now, a Republican Party commission led by Bill Brock, a former senator and party chairman, has put forward a plan to slow down the primary season so that it is more likely to last a full four months. This is a sound plan that ought to be adopted by the Republican National Convention this summer and copied by the Democrats, as well.</p>
        <p>The Brock commission proposes that small and medium-sized states vote on a population-based schedule from early March through May, choosing 53 percent of the delegates. Then the biggest states, including New York, California, Florida and Texas, would vote on the first Tuesday of June. Some critics say the contest could be decided before the megastates weighed in, but it is equally possible that their role could be decisive in a close contest.</p>

        <p>In both the Republican and Democratic parties, the presidential primaries this year were intense, competitive and, as a practical matter, over very quickly. Especially on the Republican side, there was a feeling that a more leisurely schedule would have given voters a better chance to think about the dramatic contrasts in style and message presented by Gov. George W. Bush and Senator John McCain. Now, a Republican Party commission led by Bill Brock, a former senator and party chairman, has put forward a plan to slow down the primary season so that it is more likely to last a full four months. This is a sound plan that ought to be adopted by the Republican National Convention this summer and copied by the Democrats, as well.</p>
        <p>The Brock commission proposes that small and medium-sized states vote on a population-based schedule from early March through May, choosing 53 percent of the delegates. Then the biggest states, including New York, California, Florida and Texas, would vote on the first Tuesday of June. Some critics say the contest could be decided before the megastates weighed in, but it is equally possible that their role could be decisive in a close contest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brock's group did not take a position on whether the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary should remain the leadoff events. In our view, these traditional events should continue, especially since the longer schedule would prevent them from exerting an exaggerated influence.</p>
        <p>One tradition that would go by the board is the front-loading and intense early spending that brought this year's primaries to an end by March 7. Mr. Brock's group has produced the best plan we have seen for giving the candidates enough time to develop their campaigns and giving voters across the nation a chance to participate in the primaries. The Brock commission also recommended an end to winner-take-all primaries, a step that would keep party bosses from dominating the process.</p>
        <p>The presumptive nominees, Governor Bush and Vice President Al Gore, should push their parties to adopt this plan for a fairer, slower, more democratic primary season.</p>
