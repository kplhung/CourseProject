        <p>SURE, decorators are selling luxury,'' the designer Mario Buatta said. ''But for most visitors, a show house is like a reference library of terrific ideas.'' His distinctive style can be seen in an oval sitting room at the Kips Bay Decorator Show House (at 1 East 94th Street through May 21). In fact, visiting a show house is like visiting a think tank for design professionals like Charles Spada, a Boston decorator whose off-white study is also featured at Kips Bay. ''People should go to a show house to be inspired and to take ideas away with them,'' Mr. Spada said. So visit with pencil and paper in hand (and $20 for the price of a ticket) or try any of these 10 ideas -- and some less expensive sources -- from the 28th Kips Bay Show House.</p>
        <p>1. The decorating firm of Anderson Papachristidis Raeymaekers used shutter doors to camouflage an awkwardly positioned corner window and give the illusion of a balcony door. Similar unpainted shutter doors are $49 to $69 a pair at the Home Depot (www .homedepot.com or (800) 430-3376 for locations).</p>

        <p>SURE, decorators are selling luxury,'' the designer Mario Buatta said. ''But for most visitors, a show house is like a reference library of terrific ideas.'' His distinctive style can be seen in an oval sitting room at the Kips Bay Decorator Show House (at 1 East 94th Street through May 21).

So visit with pencil and paper in hand (and $20 for the price of a ticket) or try any of these 10 ideas -- and some less expensive sources -- from the 28th Kips Bay Show House.</p>
        <p>1. The decorating firm of Anderson Papachristidis Raeymaekers used shutter doors to camouflage an awkwardly positioned corner window and give the illusion of a balcony door. Similar unpainted shutter doors are $49 to $69 a pair at the Home Depot (www .homedepot.com or (800) 430-3376 for locations).</p>
        <p>2. Richard L. Ridge and Roderick R. Denault boldly upholstered four identical club chairs from Brun schwig &amp; Fils, each in a different solid-color Brun schwig fabric ($46.50 to $148.50 a yard). Inexpensive cotton canvas, for a similar effect, is available in eight colors ($20 a yard, 64 inches wide) at Jensen Lewis, 89 Seventh Avenue (16th Street).</p>
        <p>3. Why take up floor space with a piece of uninteresting, temporary furniture like a baby-changing table when a carpenter can build one of plywood and hinge it to the wall? The one in Penny Drue Baird's baby room (easily removed when a child is older) folds up and stays put with a decorative bow.</p>
        <p>4. The white lacquered Parsons table used by Charles Spada in his study has convenient extensions on each end. ''This table is reminiscent of 18th-century writing tables that had extensions as can dlestands,'' he said. ''I like to customize a classic to suit individual needs.'' A similar but unpainted birch Parsons table, 5 feet by 2 feet by 30 inches high, is $349 with 16-inch extensions at Gothic Cabinet Craft, 360 Avenue of the Americas (Washington Place).</p>
        <p>5. A walk-in closet by Stingray Hornsby looks luxurious and neat with ceiling-to-floor wood Venetian blinds that cover the clutter. Blinds like these by Hunter Douglas can be ordered at good prices from Smith &amp; Noble, (800) 560-0027 or www .smithandnoble.com.</p>
        <p>6. Ani Antreasyan ''carpeted'' a roof deck with willow garden fencing from Smith &amp; Hawken that is $69 for a roll 4 feet wide by 9 feet long, or $49 for a roll 3 by 9 feet; (800) 776-3336 or www.smithandhawken.com for store locations and orders.</p>
        <p>7. Randall A. Ridless hung brass curtain rods to create movable displays of artwork. The hardware, in many sizes and finishes, is available at Gracious Home, 1220 Third Avenue (71st Street).</p>
        <p>8. Tonin MacCallum accessorized a sofa with embroidered Indian throw pillows, $75 each, and custom-made pillows of brightly colored silk, $15 a yard, both from Little India Emporium, 128 East 28th Street. The crystal fringe is $9 to $15 a yard at the M&amp;J Trimming Company, 1008 Avenue of the Americas (38th Street).</p>
        <p>9. Roderick N. Shade also embellished throw pillows, using fringe ($35.50 to $108 a yard) and fabric ($46.50 to $139 a yard) from F. Schumacher &amp; Company. African-style heavy cotton fabric, $12 to $15 a yard, and fringe ($3 to $20 a yard) are available from Joe's Fabric and Trimmings, 110 Orchard Street (Delancey Street).</p>
        <p>10. David Barrett's traditional silk draperies are made much like a shower curtain, with grommets that hang simply on large silver-leafed nails. Penny pinchers can just go ahead and paint their own nails.</p>
