        <p>A seven-member committee met yesterday in Dallas to pick a new 15-member team to represent the United States in women's softball at the Sydney Olympics after a successful challenge to the selection process.</p>
        <p>Julie Smith, a 31-year-old second baseman who was on the team that won the inaugural Olympic gold medal in 1996, claimed she was unfairly left off the 2000 Olympic squad. A federal arbitrator ruled in her favor last week and ordered that the team be disbanded and selected again.</p>
        <p>Smith believed that the Amateur Softball Association, the sport's national governing body, did not select the team based on performance in last September's tryouts, at which she ranked seventh offensively among 39 candidates.</p>
        <p>Bob Tomlinson, the lawyer for the association at the arbitration hearing, said he was confident the selection committee would ''follow a clean slate.''</p>
        <p>An athlete representative to the association and to the United States Olympic Committee, Smith has been a proponent of athlete's rights and feared her voice might have affected the selection process.</p>
