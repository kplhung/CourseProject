        <p>The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it signed a multiyear agreement with America Online Inc. to develop online and offline marketing programs. Terms of the agreement, the first worldwide Internet marketing initiative for Coca-Cola, were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>The alliance, which had been expected, will focus on themes like music, movies, sports, holidays and community. Coca-Cola will pitch AOL through advertising, packaging and promotions, and AOL will promote Coca-Cola products online through its AOL, Compuserve and Netscape brands. The agreement comes after the principal Coca-Cola rival, the Pepsi-Cola Company unit of PepsiCo, signed a similar agreement with the Web portal Yahoo.</p>
