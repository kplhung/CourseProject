        <p>Like the proverbial rising tide that lifts all boats, the bustling economy that has buoyed activity in New York and New Jersey ports over the last three years has now brought an effort to hire additional longshoremen for the first time in nearly 30 years.</p>
        <p>But those jobs will call more for brain power, like computer and technical skills, than for the brawn the work demanded decades ago.</p>

        <p>Like the proverbial rising tide that lifts all boats, the bustling economy that has buoyed activity in New York and New Jersey ports over the last three years has now brought an effort to hire additional longshoremen for the first time in nearly 30 years.</p>
        <p>But those jobs will call more for brain power, like computer and technical skills, than for the brawn the work demanded decades ago.</p>
        <p>''This is not Marlon Brando's waterfront anymore and never will be again,'' said Ira Womack, a 62-year-old docks foreman who has worked at the port for 43 years. He recalls the days depicted in the movie ''On the Waterfront,'' when a cargo hook and a pair of gloves were standard gear for stevedoring, and their work was called the buggy-lugging of cargo bales. ''They used to say that this was a place where the men were made of iron and the ships were made of wood,'' he said. ''Now the only way most of us get exercise is by going to the health club.''</p>
        <p>The hiring of nearly 500 longshoremen will be the subject of the first of two hearings Thursday by the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, the agency created by New York and New Jersey in 1953 to root out the mob influence and corruption that plagued the ports and threatened their viability.</p>
        <p>The two-member commission must investigate and approve all who perform the work at the docks, from the lowliest stevedore to the largest shipping companies, and so is being asked by both the industry and the union to allow and supervise the new hiring.</p>
        <p>With the exception of a trickling of emergency hiring in the last three decades and occasional temporary hiring to meet seasonal needs, new admissions into the ranks of the unionized longshoremen have been all but cut off since 1969. That was when the International Longshoremen Association, which had 27,000 members then, signed a contract to permit labor-saving mechanization and increased container shipping in exchange for a guaranteed annual income for its members, whether they worked or not.</p>
        <p>Today, after attrition and retirements, there remain only 2,700 active longshoremen -- too few, industry experts say, to handle the growing volume of cargo in and out of the port efficiently. The workers conduct computerized checks of inventory, direct the 10-story cargo cranes that load and unload containers, and drive the gangly straddle carriers that glide around the yards, looking like legs without torsos.</p>
        <p>The changes have cut the time and labor it takes to unload a 900-foot-long cargo ship to 24 hours and 10 men today, from three months and 500 men in 1969. But there is still a need for more workers to run the machines.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the new hiring plan suggests that the economy is strong, but even economic health will not  bring back the bustling docks that live on in workers' memories to a waterfront where human sounds and sweat have been replaced by the roar of motors and diesel fuel.</p>
        <p>''The camaraderie is gone and won't come back,'' lamented Joe Garcia, 60. ''Now we're all like our own bosses, sitting in a rig or a crane or carrying a portable computer, and alone. I'm glad some things about those days are gone, but I still think about them.''</p>
        <p>John Bowers, president of the union, said the new hiring was necessary not only because of the increased activity at the port, but also because of the aging of the union's membership. In the last contract, he said, the union agreed to a two-tiered system in which any new longshoremen would receive $14 an hour for their first three years rather than the $24 an hour that longer-serving workers got.</p>
        <p>''This wasn't a popular move with our people,'' Mr. Bowers said, ''but it helped the port become more competitive.''</p>
        <p>Carmine Cardone, the executive director of the Waterfront Commission, said that in the past the industry had to wait until there was a labor shortage on the docks and then petition the commission for the authority to hire a few emergency or temporary workers. That was the only method for new hiring allowed by the law creating the commission.</p>
        <p>But both New York and New Jersey adopted laws in September allowing workers to be hired for projected needs, not just current shortages, and by the shipping companies rather than the unions, so that workers could be selected for the specialized skills needed.</p>
        <p>The Waterfront Commission will still have to investigate any hired workers to see if they have criminal records or organized crime links before they can start working.</p>
        <p>Lillian Borrone, the director of port commerce for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, noted earlier this year that cargo activity had increased 7.3 percent  from 1998 to 1999.</p>
        <p>But there are still places on the docks where brawn and numbers count for more than mechanization.  At the Red Hook Terminal in Brooklyn, Sal Catucci is the owner of American Stevedoring, which moves the bales of cocoa, streaming in daily, that have made New York the largest handler of cocoa in the world in the last two years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Catucci said the new hiring of longshoremen was ''long overdue,'' because he had often gone days without enough workers to unload ships.</p>
        <p>''My work force's average age is 62 years old, the oldest in the port,'' he said. ''I'm losing men each month, and I have customers screaming because I don't have the labor to handle their ships.''</p>
