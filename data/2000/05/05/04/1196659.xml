        <p>I HAVE a history of addiction. I have never been able to pass a used-book store without feeling compelled to buy an armload. So I felt very virtuous about my ability to withstand the wiles of the flashy ad campaign staged last year by Alibris, an ambitious online bookseller.</p>
        <p>Perhaps you have seen some of the full-page ads showing beaten-up classics; the ads have appeared in dozens of magazines since November. One showed a dog-eared paperback copy of Jack Kerouac's ''On the Road'' that looked identical to the one I owned in college. Another showed a vintage edition of ''Valley of the Dolls'' that brought back memories; its pill-strewn dust jacket looked so dangerous 30 years ago when my mother and her friends were passing it around.</p>

        <p>I HAVE a history of addiction. I have never been able to pass a used-book store without feeling compelled to buy an armload. So I felt very virtuous about my ability to withstand the wiles of the flashy ad campaign staged last year by Alibris, an ambitious online bookseller.</p>
        <p>Perhaps you have seen some of the full-page ads showing beaten-up classics; the ads have appeared in dozens of magazines since November. One showed a dog-eared paperback copy of Jack Kerouac's ''On the Road'' that looked identical to the one I owned in college. Another showed a vintage edition of ''Valley of the Dolls'' that brought back memories; its pill-strewn dust jacket looked so dangerous 30 years ago when my mother and her friends were passing it around.</p>
        <p>Both tempted me sorely. But I passed them up, smugly congratulating myself for being strong enough to resist the full force of this early phase of a five-year, $100 million marketing attack that Alibris (www.alibris.com) is directing at nostalgic shoppers like me.</p>
        <p>Then I saw the smart little mouse.</p>
        <p>Paging through Bon Appetit last week, I came across an Alibris ad that showed him inhabiting a knothole on the cover of the children's book called ''Smart Little Mouse,'' published in 1950. Honestly, I hadn't thought about the big-eyed little gray fellow in more than 30 years, not since the days when my brother and I fought over whose turn it was to sleep with that book. Did it matter that I had happened to stumble upon him after all these years?</p>
        <p>Of course it did. He was a treasured friend from my childhood. It was all coming back to me now. I used to sit by the window in that leather chair (the brown leather chair!) and look at the pictures before I was old enough to read it.</p>
        <p>I had to have that rodent.</p>
        <p>As I said, I have a problem. Usually when I succumb, I search for used books online at BookFinder.com (www.bookfinder.com), a homegrown search engine created in 1996 by Anirvan Chatterjee, who at the time was a 19-year-old student at the University of California at Berkeley. Over the years, the project has grown into a small company, still overseen by Mr. Chatterjee, called 13th Generation Media.</p>
        <p>I have used BookFinder.com for about a year and a half and like it for many reasons. It is, in its simplicity, very different from a company like Alibris, which marks up books 20 percent and acts as a liaison between buyers and sellers, repackaging books under its own label before mailing them.</p>
        <p>BookFinder.com, on the other hand, does not get in the middle and does not tack on a finder's fee. (Mr. Chatterjee said the site's main source of revenue was advertising, augmented by referral fees from some individual booksellers.) BookFinder.com puts buyers and sellers directly in touch with each other to close the deal. With a database of 20 million books (compared with the 10 million that Alibris has for sale) and listings from 20,000 sources, including those of large listing services like the Advanced Book Exchange and Bibliofind, the search engine eliminates the need for separate visits to multiple sellers' sites. It recently began listing books available on Half.com, where amateurs like me try to sell copies of old books gathering dust in back rooms. It also carries Alibris's listings (there is a lot of overlap in online book listings).</p>
        <p>But for the moment, I forgot about BookFinder.com. All I could think about was that big full-color ad. I went right to Alibris's Web site, which describes itself as ''the world's leading supplier of hard-to-find books.'' There I typed ''Smart Little Mouse'' into the search query box, prepared to sift through dozens of copies in search of just the right one (was it too much to hope for a copy with a nick on the cover, like the one caused by my brother's propensity to wield the book like a hammer?) and ready to pay any price.</p>
        <p>The search results announced: ''Sorry. No matches were found!''</p>
        <p>Had I done something wrong? Or was Alibris advertising a book it did not have? I phoned Martin Manley, the company's president and chief executive, to find out.</p>
        <p>''The books we advertise tend to sell out,'' Mr. Manley explained. He recommended that I list my request on the site's Bookhound feature, which would notify me if a copy became available.</p>
        <p>That sounded logical. And sane. And totally unfulfilling.</p>
        <p>Instead I went to BookFinder.com, where I found a copy of ''The Smart Little Mouse'' that was available for $12 from a Baltimore bookseller. I bought it. I then searched both Alibris and BookFinder.com for five other titles recently featured in Alibris ads. In all five cases, BookFinder.com's results offered more copies, more editions and lower prices. In one case, Alibris and BookFinder.com each had an identically worded listing for a first edition of ''Valley of the Dolls.'' On BookFinder.com, which listed the dealer's name and address, the price was $450. On Alibris, which did not, it cost $540.</p>
        <p>Mr. Manley said the difference in price was not a typographical error; shoppers are willing to pay the extra 20 percent in return for a high level of customer service. ''You may be able to able to get the book directly from a dealer, and in some cases that works just fine,'' he said. ''Our experience is that many people prefer buying from a company that is building a recognized brand and who will guarantee quality and reliability of inventory.'' In fact, Alibris offers a full refund on any book for 30 days. In a recent case, Mr. Manley said, a form stated the reason for return simply as ''boring.''</p>
        <p>''So when I say we take books back for any reason at all, I mean you can send it back if you decide it didn't match the drapes,'' Mr. Manley said.</p>
        <p>Is it worth it? Although I have never encountered a problem dealing directly with a seller in the past year and a half, I have to admit that the stakes have not been high. I am not in the market for rare or expensive editions; I usually buy the cheapest copy I can find. What if I wanted an expensive first edition of ''Valley of the Dolls?'' Would $90 be too much to pay for insurance?</p>
        <p>While I am trying to decide, I think I'll ask my mom to look for her old copy.</p>
