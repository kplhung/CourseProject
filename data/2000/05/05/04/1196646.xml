        <p>Q.  I would like to buy a digital camera but I find advertisements with terms like megapixels and resolutions confusing. What kind will take decent pictures?</p>
        <p>A.  With the prices of digital cameras dropping to more comfortable levels and the picture quality getting better, digital photography has become more popular.</p>
        <p>In the world of digital cameras, a pixel is the smallest unit of data in the image. Like building blocks, a bunch of pixels all grouped together will create something larger: the image itself.</p>
        <p>The word ''resolution'' refers to the sharpness of the picture the camera produces and how clear that image appears.</p>
        <p>A camera with a lower resolution number, like 640 pixels by 480 lines (often referred to as just 640 x 480 in advertisements), produces a total of 307,200 pixels to display each picture.</p>
        <p>Megapixel cameras, which use more than a million pixels to create the image, have a higher resolution.</p>
        <p>A camera with a resolution of 1,800 pixels by 1,200 lines can produce images containing 2.16 million pixels. The resulting pictures are much sharper than those taken by a lower-resolution camera because the picture is made up of more pixels.</p>
        <p>As a rule of thumb, the higher the resolution of the camera, the higher the price tag.</p>
        <p>Adjustable lenses and storage capacity (how many digital pictures the camera's memory will hold at one time) are two other factors that can affect the price.</p>
        <p>But prices for cameras in the middle of the resolution spectrum have fallen, and it is possible to buy cameras with resolutions of 1,280 x 960 and 1,440 x 1,080 for about $300 to $400.</p>
        <p>The type of camera that would be best for your needs depends on what type of pictures you plan to take and what you plan to do with them.</p>
        <p>If you want to take photos that will look good if you print them out at a traditional photo-lab size, like 4 inches by 5 inches, a midrange camera with a 1,280-by-960 resolution should do the job. The resolution of the printer that you are using, be it a regular all-purpose printer or a photo printer, will also affect the overall picture quality.</p>
        <p>If you want good-looking 8-by-10 pictures, you will probably want a higher-resolution camera. If you just want a camera to take quick photographs to put up on a Web site or to attach to e-mail, a lower-resolution camera may be all that you need.</p>
        <p>Q.  I am getting a new computer, and I know I can transfer all of my data from the old PC to the new one with an Ethernet cable. But is there a way to transfer my programs, Explorer favorites and system configurations so I don't have to kill a day getting everything on the new machine the way I want it?</p>
        <p>A.  A number of utility programs on the market will help you with this problem. They will generally let you transfer your old system settings onto the new PC in a relatively painless manner, although the software will probably need a small dose of hands-on help from you to get everything in place.</p>
        <p>Programs like PC Transplant Pro by Altiris and Desktop DNA by Miramar Systems are expensive (about $250) and are aimed more at computer professionals maintaining an office full of machines than at the average home user upgrading the family hardware every few years. But these programs give you a lot of control over what you want to transfer, leaving behind the files you don't want or need.</p>
        <p>More in the price range of the typical home user is Aloha Bob's PC-Relocator, which costs around $50 and can be ordered from the www .alohabob.com site.</p>
        <p>The program doesn't let you pick what you want to transfer, though; it simply moves everything. Your browser favorites, programs, settings and other important files should show up in the right place to work properly on the new machine.</p>
