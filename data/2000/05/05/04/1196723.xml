        <p>The coffins of livery-cab drivers, shipped back to this country from from New York nearly once a week during the city's recent spate of killings, have badly shaken this poor mountain town of 55,000, which for decades has sent its young men to drive the streets of New York in pursuit of a decent, if dangerous wage.</p>
        <p>Families here have exacted promises from sons, brothers and fathers in New York not to work at night, to install required partitions or get out of the business. And those planning to leave for New York are being told to steer clear of the livery cab industry.</p>
        <p>''I have two teenage sons who want to join my brother Paulo driving livery cabs,'' said Rosario Vargas, ''but I and a lot of other mothers have put down this rule: Go if you have to, but driving livery cabs is out of the question.''</p>
        <p>San Jose de Las Matas, 120 miles north of the capital, Santo Domingo, is perched amid sharp, razor-backed peaks, floppy royal palms, arching plane trees and banana groves. Along with the surrounding villages and hamlets, it has long fueled the livery cab industry in New York. Indeed, drivers from San Jose de Las Matas have come to dominate many of the car services in Manhattan. Town officials estimate that over $100,000 a month is sent back from New York.</p>
        <p>The work has always been dicey and killings part of the trade. But not for a decade, when a previous series of New York City shootings left many Dominicans dead, has there been such widespread apprehension in places like San Jose.</p>
        <p>The value of plastic partitions is as widely debated over domino games as the weather. And street names and neighborhoods from the Bronx, Washington Heights and Brooklyn are discussed as if they were across town. A neighborhood in Queens is called Sabana Iglesia after the rolling hills that spread out from San Jose de Las Matas.</p>
        <p>''The Dominicans were quick to fill the hole left in many parts of New York when the yellow cabs abandoned high crime areas around 1984,'' said Jaime Vargas, who for 13 years was the director of the Livery Cab Owners Coalition, now known as the Federation of Livery Cab Drivers. ''We created the industry.  There is great pride here about this. But it has always been risky.''</p>
        <p>The poverty in this remote region drove hundreds of Dominicans to the city in the early 1960's when all they needed was a work permit. Many stayed, and slowly relatives and neighbors followed, often packing themselves into the same apartment buildings in Washington Heights, the Bronx and Brooklyn. The exodus over the years has, in fact, left small villages in the area wiped out, as subsistence farmers gave up to work in the city.</p>
        <p>The appeal of New York, and the dollars that driving its streets at night can yield, remain powerful, and the economic pipeline and the support networks have been solidified over the years. Over the last few decades, San Jose de Las Matas has in large part been built off the earnings of livery-cab drivers and bodega owners. Cabdriving remains one of the few ways a young man with no skills can make money. And nearly everyone has a cousin or a friend willing to let them camp out on the floor, introduce them to car service owners and feed them until they find work.</p>
        <p>And so with regularity, lithe young men, adorned with thick gold chains, designer jeans and wads of dollar bills, return here after taking their first cracks at driving livery cabs or stocking the shelves of bodegas in New York.</p>
        <p>They are called ''the Dominican Yorks,'' and in their moments of returning glory, they saunter down the rutted back alleys where they grew up and, for a brief, sweet moment, are somebody. It's part of the modest payback for months of drudgery and danger.</p>
        <p>''They flash their chains and show off their money,'' said Santiago Bueno, 38, who worked in a bodega in New York for many years. ''It's a ritual, but people long ago figured out how they really live, what their lives are really like.''</p>
        <p>He meant that New York is often not glamorous, its perils great. And so even here, where the average income is about $70 a month, the concern is beginning to outweigh the lure. While none of those killed in New York this year are from this town -- six of the nine killed since January were from the Dominican Republic -- many expect, given the high numbers of drivers from the area, that it is a matter of time. Nearly everyone here has a friend or relative who has had a close call, or even been killed.</p>
        <p>''My cousin Rene Rodriguez was shot dead seven years ago this March rushing to help another driver that was being held up,'' said Elena Estevez. ''His widow lives up the street with his three children. After he died, my brother bought his car and began doing the same job. He's still driving in New York, but none of us like it. We all wait for the phone to ring.''</p>
        <p>San Jose de Las Matas is a town where poverty and underdevelopment are obvious. The last stretch of road leading here from Santiago, for instance, is dirt, much of it washed out, and cars and trucks slow to a dusty crawl.</p>
        <p>But the evidence of New York-generated income is obvious, too. Many houses are no longer made of wood, but concrete painted blue, ochre and white and topped with red tiled roofs. Station wagons, the vehicle of choice for bodega owners, and pickup trucks, many shipped down from New York, lie parked in driveways.</p>
        <p>Antonio Rodriguez sat in a plastic chair with Rafael Urena under the shade of a corrugated tin roof, their taxis parked on the street.</p>
        <p>''We all ask what is happening?'' said Mr. Rodriguez, whose brother drives a livery cab in New York. ''Is it part of the racism against Latinos? Why is it always a Dominican or a Latino that dies?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Urena has two brothers in New York who drive livery cabs.</p>
        <p>''I am getting ready to go but my brothers tell me it is too dangerous,'' Mr. Urena said. ''They tell me to try and find other work. But suppose there is no other work? What can I do? If the only way I can make some money is to drive, I will drive.''</p>
        <p>Jose Antonio Roman, who ran a car service in New York, went home and on July 4, 1994, a date he chose deliberately, opened the town's first radio dispatch service. He has 24 cars and employs his son, Fausto, whom he has dissuaded from going to New York.</p>
        <p>''Here I am middle class,'' he said, after barking orders over the radio, powered by a 10-volt car battery on the porch. ''What am I there? Here, we find a drunk and the police call us to take him home to his wife. In New York a couple of drunks get into your car and you do not know if you are going to get out alive or with your money.''</p>
        <p>He stopped to comfort a driver over the radio whose passengers had been picked up by a rival driver nicknamed Torpedo because of the way he barrels to locations.</p>
        <p>''The city has a powerful pull,'' he said. ''It hovers over us. The fact is, if you are willing to work like a dog, you can come back in a few years with enough to build something. I learned how to run a dispatch service in New York, but it was not much of a life.''</p>
