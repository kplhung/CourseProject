        <p>MAHONEY-David. The faculty and staff of Columbia University College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons and New York-Presbyterian Hospital mourn the loss of our esteemed friend, David Mahoney. Recognized throughout the country as an outstanding business leader and visionary in the field of Neuroscience, he had a profound influence in advancing brain research. His many outstanding contributions to medical education, research, and practice include his generous support of the David Mahoney Center for Brain and Behavior Research at Columbia University which is investigating the link between the molecular workings of brain cells and human cognition. A longtime friend and benefactor, he will be missed and his memory cherished. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Hildegarde, and the rest of the Mahoney family. Thomas Q. Morris, M.D., Interim Dean for Clinical and Educational Affairs, Columbia University College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons, David I. Hirsh, Ph.D., Interim Dean for Research, Columbia University College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons, Herbert Pardes, M.D., President and CEO, New York-Presbyterian Hospital</p>
        <p>MAHONEY-David. The Board of Directors and Members of The Association for a Better New York are saddened by the passing of a great New Yorker. His pioneering spirit led the return of corporate America to New York City in the early 1970's. ABNY will always remember him. Condolences to Hillie and his family. Lewis Rudin, Chairman</p>
