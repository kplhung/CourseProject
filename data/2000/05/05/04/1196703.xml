        <p>I enjoyed Bill Clinton's comedy video for the Washington correspondents' dinner, but does anyone share my uneasy feeling that it might have been the final straw in the unfortunate blurring of show business and politics?</p>
        <p>Bill had great timing, did his facial shtick well and got the schlump walk perfectly. And I do feel I can call him Bill now. ''Mr. President'' sounds so serious for someone who looked so right hanging out with Stuart, the guy who puts his face in the copy machine in the TV commercial.</p>

        <p>I enjoyed Bill Clinton's comedy video for the Washington correspondents' dinner, but does anyone share my uneasy feeling that it might have been the final straw in the unfortunate blurring of show business and politics?</p>
        <p>Bill had great timing, did his facial shtick well and got the schlump walk perfectly. And I do feel I can call him Bill now. ''Mr. President'' sounds so serious for someone who looked so right hanging out with Stuart, the guy who puts his face in the copy machine in the TV commercial.</p>
        <p>I'm worried, though, about what this will do to Al Gore and George W. Bush. Now that the bar has been raised so high, America will be looking for a major laugh riot talent in the next president of the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton started something in 1992, when he blew his horn on Arsenio Hall's show and appeared on Phil Donahue. Now all the candidates are yukking it up with Letterman and Leno. To prove what? That they're funny? That they're just like us? I don't want presidents to be just like me, and I don't care if they're funny.</p>
        <p>Out on the campaign trail, George W. appears to be adapting. Last Saturday, I heard him deliver a 10-minute comedy routine at the radio talk show convention. He was relaxed, had a good delivery, and didn't slow himself down with any talk about policies or governing. He did blush when I shook hands with him afterward and said, ''Hey, good material.''</p>
        <p>Al Gore, on the other hand, while said to be a really amusing guy in person, is not wowing them so far -- though he has made himself more camera-ready with all that work on his pecs.</p>
        <p>I just hope no budding statesman out there thinks being an experienced, intelligent, hardworking politician is going to be enough from now on. That's a pretty funny joke right there. But it's on us.</p>
