        <p>Stock prices skidded yesterday as investors absorbed more troubling data on the rapid growth of the economy and braced for more such disappointment today and tomorrow.</p>
        <p>The major market gauges fell more than 2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average lost ground for the fifth time in six sessions, falling 250.99 points, or 2.34 percent, to 10,480.13.

        <p>Stock prices skidded yesterday as investors absorbed more troubling data on the rapid growth of the economy and braced for more such disappointment today and tomorrow.</p>
        <p>The major market gauges fell more than 2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average lost ground for the fifth time in six sessions, falling 250.99 points, or 2.34 percent, to 10,480.13. The Nasdaq composite dropped 78.14 points, or 2.06 percent, to 3,707.31, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index was off 31.19 points, or 2.16 percent, to 1,415.10.</p>
        <p>The worrisome evidence of economic strength showed up in a government report that factory orders in March were higher than expected, in a Federal Reserve survey showing ''intensifying wage pressures'' and in comments by a top central bank official, William McDonough, on economic imbalances and strains. Productivity figures are to be released today, and a crucial report on the labor market is due tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Such data is seen as increasing the amount by which the Fed, at a meeting on May 16, is likely to raise interest rates, for the sixth time since last June.</p>
        <p>''There's tremendous anxiety around the rate hike,'' said John Peluso, a senior trader at Lehman Brothers. ''The market is more and more perceiving a 50-basis-point rise coming down the pike.'' Almost nobody expects the Fed to leave rates alone, and those still expecting a rise limited to 25 points, or one-quarter percentage point, are now a clear minority.</p>
        <p>Another drag on the market yesterday was a downgrading of Wal-Mart and other retail shares by Goldman, Sachs, which said that the national shopping spree was winding down as retailers faced cost pressures. Wal-Mart, the biggest chain, sagged 4 3/16, to 53 7/16, and Sears, Roebuck fell 2 5/8, to 36 7/16.</p>
        <p>If the Fed should misjudge the needed credit restraint, others said, the economy could move quickly from too much growth to too little.</p>
        <p>''The economy's extremely leveraged to the wealth effect,'' said Timothy M. Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corporation. ''If we see the stock market slow down, we think consumer spending dries up pretty quickly.''</p>
        <p>And stock values have shriveled, with the Nasdaq composite and the Dow industrials each down 8.9 percent so far this year.</p>
        <p>While a few food and beverage stocks resisted the latest downturn -- Coca-Cola rose 2 1/4, to 48 1/2, the only Dow component to gain as much as a point -- drugs and other so-called defensive stocks mostly succumbed to moderate selling pressure.</p>
        <p>Technology was hit hard, with Novell down 6 15/16, to 10 5/8, after reporting poor earnings; Hewlett-Packard down 5 9/16, to 132 1/2; Cisco Systems down 1 15/16, to 66 1/16; and AT&amp;T, downgraded by PaineWebber, slumping for a second day. AT&amp;T fell 2 3/16, to 39 3/4, while its newly marketed wireless unit fell 13/16, to 31 7/16, after reaching 36 on Monday. Microsoft, however, edged up 11/16, to 70 3/16.</p>
        <p>General Motors, skidding 5 5/16, to 88 1/16, suffered from a Lehman Brothers recommendation to switch from it to Ford, which lost 7/16, to 52 13/16.</p>
        <p>Bestfoods, object of a bid late Tuesday by Unilever, jumped 10 11/16, to 61 1/4. Disney fell 1 1/4, to 41 1/4, but reported better-than-expected earnings for its second quarter after the close of normal trading.</p>
