        <p>Among the quiet words Don Zimmer muttered to the manager sitting next to him in the Yankees' dugout tonight was a prediction: Shane Spencer will hit a home run, Zimmer told Joe Torre. It was Spencer's swing that made him feel this way.</p>
        <p>But maybe prognosticating good things for the Yankees is like forecasting sunshine in San Diego. Sure, Spencer hit a home run, and a ninth-inning triple, spurring a wild comeback that was aided by the defensive gaffes of a former teammate, and the Yankees pulled out another improbable victory, 6-5 over the Cleveland Indians.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are 11-1 in games decided by one and two runs, and they have won four consecutive games and 24 of their 33 regular season games at Jacobs Field.</p>
        <p>Charlie Manuel, the Cleveland manager, watched his team blow a four-run lead hours after the team announced he would take a leave of absence for a surgical procedure. In spring training, Manuel had a colostomy for a ruptured colon, and on Friday, his colon will be reattached. He is expected to rejoin the Indians within two weeks. The bench coach Grady Little will manage Cleveland in the interim.</p>
        <p>After the game, Torre acknowledged that his team had really not played that well, and that the starting pitcher David Cone ''deserved a better fate.'' Cone was trying to win on four days' rest, something he has done once since June 9 last year (in nine attempts). He had good stuff, shutting out the Indians in the first three innings.</p>
        <p>But the defense performed raggedly behind him, Bernie Williams overthrowing a cutoff man from center, Scott Brosius dropping a throw at third that would have cut down a runner, Ricky Ledee straggling after a ground single to left and second baseman Wilson Delgado failing to knock down a bouncer. After Delgado's play, Cone turned and dropped his head, probably some disgust mixed with frustration, for the Yankees trailed, 5-1.</p>
        <p>There were two outs in the seventh and no one on base when Spencer whacked the home run that Zimmer foresaw, Spencer's sixth homer of the year. Spencer has begun using his hands more in his swing, trusting his hands, rather than lurching at the ball with his front foot, and Zimmer and Torre can see the difference.</p>
        <p>The Yankees could feel a difference in the eighth, when they began to sense they had a shot. Ledee and Derek Jeter singled, and Ledee scored when Paul O'Neill lined a double that bounced over the wall in right-center.</p>
        <p>Jeter scored as well, on a groundout, so Cleveland's lead was reduced to 5-4 entering the ninth. Steve Karsay, who had converted all four of his save chances for the Indians before this game, struck out Jorge Posada to open the inning.</p>
        <p>For Spencer, Karsay was not a complex puzzle: good stuff, a good fastball and curve. Spencer pulled a long foul down the left-field line; he was behind in the count, one ball and two strikes, but he did not feel that he was at a disadvantage.</p>
        <p>He fouled off another pitch, and another. On the eighth pitch of the at-bat, Spencer slammed a high drive to center, where Mark Whiten, a former Yankee, was playing in place of the injured Kenny Lofton.</p>
        <p>''I thought it had a chance to go out,'' Spencer said.</p>
        <p>Whiten ran to the warning track, turned so that he faced home plate, backed up and reached up -- and missed the ball, which ricocheted off the fence and away from Whiten. Spencer sprinted to third with the first triple of his career.</p>
        <p>With Brosius next at bat, the Cleveland infielders moved in, hoping to cut off the tying run. Brosius had noticed how Karsay pitched to Spencer, fastballs on the outer half of the plate, so this is what Brosius looked for. Karsay threw a fastball away, first pitch, and Brosius lined a single to center. Tie game.</p>
        <p>Delgado popped up for the second out but Ledee smashed a liner toward the wall in right-center field. The contact had been near the end of his bat, however, and he did not think the ball had a chance to land in the stands. Ledee ran up the first-base line, seeing Whiten close quickly on the ball.</p>
        <p>Brosius ran hard around second. He heard fans moan, and suddenly the third-base coach Willie Randolph was screaming at him, ''C'mon, get in, get in.''</p>
        <p>Whiten reached the ball, reached up while running, leaped a bit and dropped the ball. Ledee was credited with a double, but it was clear that Whiten should have made the catch.</p>
        <p>''I just misplayed them,'' Whiten said of the two drives in the ninth. ''I just didn't come up with the catches. I should've made them.''</p>
        <p>Mariano Rivera escaped a Cleveland rally in the ninth by getting David Justice to fly out with two on and two out. It was Rivera's third save in three days and his 10th of the season.</p>
        <p>And more good fortune for the Yankees. ''I'll accept luck,'' Torre said. ''The thing I'll credit my club with is they keep plugging and keep plugging, and they pull it out.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>TONY CLONINGER, the Yankees' bullpen coach, has not been in Cleveland for this series and will not rejoin the team until Saturday because of a health-related issue that club officials will not disclose. . . . Second baseman CHUCK KNOBLAUCH will go through a second round of testing on his sprained left wrist and hand on Thursday, and unless he arrives completely healthy at Yankee Stadium on Friday, when the Yankees begin a three-game series against Baltimore, he will probably go on the 15-day disabled list for the first time in his career. If so, ALFONSO SORIANO will probably be called up to take his place. He is playing second base for Class AAA Columbus.</p>
