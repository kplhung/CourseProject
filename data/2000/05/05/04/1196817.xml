        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''A Political Babe'' (Op-Ed, May 1): Like Pat Schroeder, I, too, tired of questions about my hair and clothes when I was on the campaign trail.</p>
        <p>However, like most women, President Barbie is more than her appearance. She also has brains. She was a professional basketball player, a surgeon and an airline pilot before becoming an astronaut. With a resume like that, running for president was a natural next step.</p>
        <p>If Barbie can get little girls to think about the opportunity for leadership in sports and in science, why not politics? The White House Project, the organization devoted to getting a woman in the White House, teamed up with Mattel so girls can begin to have a vision of women in the nation's top political job. If girls learn at a young age that they can be president, maybe they'll also grow up believing they will be.</p>
