        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As president of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, I can attest that the new computerized robot dogs are good news for real-life dogs and other animals, who so often suffer at the hands of people who acquire them and then ignore, neglect or abuse them (''Plenty of Barks and Bytes, No Housebreaking Required,'' April 20). Whether well educated or barely educated, rich or poor, many people acquire dogs and cats without much thought, as if animals are toys, then find that they don't want to spend the time and money or accept the responsibility of caring for an animal properly.</p>

        <p>Mechanical dogs won't shed, ruin the rug or keep becoming pregnant. When the novelty wears off, no one will have to take them out into the country and pretend that they can survive on berries or dump them at the shelter and break their hearts.</p>
        <p>Until robot pets arrive at a store near you, please remember that real dogs and cats need love, attention and respect.</p>
