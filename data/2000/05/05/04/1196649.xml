        <p>IMAGINE a house in the Hamptons that doesn't scream for attention. Or one that isn't a genetically engineered version of the grandes dames still holding forth on beach and pond front.</p>
        <p>Modesty and appropriateness are not A-list qualities on that long finger extending into the Atlantic. Yet, in Montauk, where nothing upstages the pounding surf and rolling dunes, a new house manages to be the strong and silent type, with just enough attitude to be exciting. It was designed by Scott Phillips and Peggy Deamer, New York architects with a growing reputation for homes that are sensitive to the landscape and have low-key panache, along with elegant built-in cabinetwork to impress even the Shakers.</p>
        <p>The clients, a Manhattan couple who are so self-effacing they wouldn't be named, didn't want the old cliches anyway. No wideplanked verandas, no screened porches and painted shutters, no shingled eyebrow windows blinking at sunrises. He grew up on the coast of Spain in Basque country where, he said, ''the buildings on the ocean have to be substantial.'' She summered in the Hamptons in an architect-designed modern house. They told Deamer &amp; Phillips to find their inspiration in the former and, please, to avoid the latter. ''I'm a little tired of those modern statements. It works in a museum, like Bilbao, but it's hard on a home that you're supposed to live in,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Stretching to accommodate a more European-influenced approach, the architects suggested a massive stone wall as the element that would quietly but distinctively set the 3,200-square-foot house apart. One face evokes the farmhouses of the Basque and establishes a fortress-like wall against the battering winds on the north. It is stern but romantic, and the tiny windows minimize disappointing views of the surrounding 50's-era ranches as they gradually give way to mega-haciendas. But the architects did not want to build -- and the clients couldn't afford -- a house literally made of stone.</p>
        <p>Instead, it became a house of layers and shifting moods.</p>
        <p>The basic mass is a shingled box with a pitched standing-seam copper roof (after one the clients had seen and liked at the Duck Walk Vineyards on Route 27). The wall, made of dry-stacked quartzite, runs along only the north and west and is pulled out from the body of the house almost like a shell from a mollusk, with a strip of skylight acting like connecting tissue. ''We wanted something to link the house to the landscape and to wrap the house without necessarily being of the house,'' Ms. Deamer said. The wall cost about $100,000 in an overall project of about $1 million.</p>
        <p>On the oceanfront or south-facing side of the house, a flat wall of continuous glass doors and windows is bumped out and slightly skewed at one end to give the dining area on the lower floor and a bedroom balcony above the more advantageous views along the bluff. On this side of the house, the feeling is of an informal getaway.</p>
        <p>Pass the lemonade. The lawn chairs sit on the grass just a few feet from the path down the dunes to the beach. An outdoor shower stands in the middle of the lawn.</p>
        <p>But people are more likely to seek refuge from the wind whipping through the pages of their summer reads by gathering at the 40-foot cerulean blue pool, whose water laps right up to the stone wall. It was a lucky compromise that led to this elegant moat. Ms. Deamer and Mr. Phillips had thought to locate the pool on an adjoining lot, while the clients saw it going down on the beach below the bluff. They received approval to build there shortly before a new zoning law would have prohibited it. Then, even as the bulldozers were gunning their motors to rip through the sands, the owners had second thoughts, asking their architects to figure out how to fit the pool between the front of the house and a small garage-guesthouse along the road. ''We were dismayed -- the ongoing assumption was that it was going down the bluff,'' Ms. Deamer said, noting that the homeowners flattered them by saying they were so ingenious they could  ''make something good out of a bad situation.''</p>
        <p>Clients and architects alike agreed that the pool must not look suburban, but rather grotto-like, Ms. Deamer said. So the pool was pushed right up against the house. Vertical channels were cut out of the rock face to collect rain water. (Little spouts in the grooves can be turned on for instant waterfalls.) The landscape, made in collaboration with the designer Margie Ruddick, combines the European with the native: cyprus hedge, shad and olive trees. If it isn't Tivoli's Villa d'Este, it certainly transcends suburbia.</p>
        <p>The interior is modern without being stark. The clients decided against metal detailing except in the kitchen, where the walls are sheathed in stainless steel.</p>
        <p>The plan is open, in typical contemporary home fashion. ''It's always important to be able to circulate in a light-filled space rather than be subjected to a rear corridor at the back of the house,'' Mr. Phillips said. Basic living spaces are on the ground floor, and there are three bedrooms on the second.</p>
        <p>Weekend-ready white canvas furnishings are coupled with Deamer &amp; Phillips's signature built-in pale maple cabinetwork -- demure ornament that works. Here and there, the clients used bolder detail to reiterate the feeling of a rustic Spanish farmhouse. A pair of heavily carved shutters serve as doors on a cabinet for Champagne glasses.  A medieval wooden door, complete with iron studs and hinges, was imported from Switzerland. ''I forced it on them,'' one of the clients said of the architects. ''It was against their grain.'' But, he added that  ''they accepted it.''</p>
        <p>The contrast to the simple maple cabinetwork throughout the interior is notable, but the heavy doors on the threshold also capture the overall achievement of the house and its mastery at combining creatively the modest with the moody.</p>
