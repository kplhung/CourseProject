        <p>Trisha Brown's triumph at the Brooklyn Academy of Music last June with Monteverdi's ''Orfeo'' (she directed and choreographed the opera) has been followed up by a veritable creative jag.</p>
        <p>To lead off its 30th anniversary season, the Trisha Brown Dance Company opened a two-week run on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater with the first of two New York premieres that Ms. Brown has choreographed to commissioned music by the jazz-influenced composer Dave Douglas.</p>
        <p>''Five Part Weather Invention,'' as this impressively polished piece is called, is a bright and joyous confection, splashing its dancers in colorful costumes across the stage like paint on a canvas. Although new in guise, especially in its close relationship to music, it is a typical Brown work, able to entertain while operating on a complex cerebral level.</p>
        <p>There was a time when one was always tempted to take up Ms. Brown's implied invitation to analyze the underlying concept of each work. Structure is often what these pure-movement pieces are about, but within such structure Ms. Brown bases the weight and quality of her movement on what she used to call an organizing principle.</p>
        <p>In short, she has a formal springboard for investigating movement, as is clear in the rest of the program, which has a retrospective tone.</p>
        <p>Austere solos like ''Water Motor'' (1978) and ''Accumulation With Talking Plus Water Motor'' (performed by Ms. Brown in a 1986 film of the same name directed by Jonathan Demme) are concerned with gestures and everyday movement, rigorously transformed into dance by phrasing and rhythm. In ''Water Motor,'' Ms. Brown, performing live under Jennifer Tipton's clarifying lighting, is all detail and nuance in a foot-pawing, wrist-flicking dance in which she seems to turn herself inside out. Mr. Demme and his cinematographer, Jacek Laskus, offer witty and apt close-ups of toes, heels and thumbs and then full-body shots of Ms. Brown until the dance seems to blow up and Ms. Brown lands on her back.</p>
        <p>In ''If You Couldn't See Me'' (1994), Ms. Brown's self-imposed task is to keep her face averted from the audience. For all its formal concept, it is a sensuous dance sensuously performed by Ms. Brown, in Robert Rauschenberg's beautiful barebacked dresses. Mr. Rauschenberg was responsible for the stop-and-go sound score and Spencer Brown for the fine lighting.</p>
        <p>The slippery liquid movement that was Ms. Brown's choreographic trademark took a surprising turn in 1987 with ''Newark (Niweweorce),'' whose title is a word-association  game. Ms. Brown was creating a new work, which made her think of Newark and an Anglo-Saxon spelling of the name. The choreography is about the use of weight, sometimes dead.</p>
        <p>Here Seth Parker and Keith Thompson were astonishing in their carved rocklike shapes, head and shoulder often anchoring them to the floor. Joining them, Katrina Thompson and Abigail Yager had the same consistent texture, but the female roles (the cast included Kathleen Fisher and Mariah Maloney) generally had less impact. One also missed  the changing colored backdrops that Donald Judd designed for the original production.</p>
        <p>At some point, however, one realizes that the theories behind Ms. Brown's work are not as important as the results onstage. The new piece, ''Five Part Weather Invention,'' allows for improvisation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fisher, dancing in silhouette,  has some freedom to choose her movement in a solo. Similarly, when dancers drop to the floor within a group, perhaps they do so at different times at different performances. Mr. Thompson may well play follow the leader: dancers imitate his gestures with sufficient retard at one point to suggest they may not know what comes next, but then again, they are often in unison with him. At another point two dancers dart out of the way as two others seemingly want to step into their places.</p>
        <p>The Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival commissioned the piece and presented its world premiere in Becket, Mass., last July. Mr. Douglas and his Charms of the Night Sky ensemble played live. The score was now heard on tape: to call it jazz is to stretch the definition of the form, which is what Mr. Douglas is evidently attempting, given his arty mix of initial modernistic string passages, trumpet and vocal utterances from the musicians.</p>
        <p>A fabulous backdrop by Terry Winters (inklike lines and scribbles, wonderfully illuminated by Ms. Tipton during Ms. Fisher's solo) sets off his turquoise, orange and chartreuse costumes for the highly active dancers.</p>
        <p>The partnering is varied (there is a sit-spin ice-skating turn in reverse for one woman) and throughout the five sections most of the dancers reel off from a single file. Yet just as often the line expands into a jumble of bodies, spreading like molasses. Brandi Norton and Todd Stone were noticeable in a happily resilient cast that included Ms. Maloney, Mr. Parker, Stacy Matthew Spence, Mr. Thompson, Ms. Thompson and Ms. Yager.</p>
