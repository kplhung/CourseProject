        <p>The American Ballet Theater Studio Company is a special group, directed by John Meehan, dedicated to training dancers between the ages of 16 and 21. Its program last Thursday night at the Kaye Playhouse suggested that this ''second company'' of American Ballet Theater is providing first-rate training. The young dancers looked both technically secure and emotionally mature.</p>
        <p>They had to be both in Natalie Weir's ''Bitter Moon,'' the most distinguished piece of a choreographically strong evening. Ms. Weir is an Australian choreographer whose works are comparatively unknown here. But when the Studio Company presented Ms. Weir's ''His Weeping'' last year, this poignant ballet made dancegoers want to see more by her.</p>
        <p>''Bitter Moon'' would not have disappointed them. In this ballet for three couples, everyone appeared to be possessed by wild passions. Extended sequences of unison movements expressed the overwhelming power of those feelings. And when couples danced different, rather than the same, steps, or when individuals wandered in alone, they seemed lost in an emotional maze.</p>
        <p>The recorded accompaniment -- Rachmaninoff's unabashedly Romantic Trio ''Elegiaque'' No. 2 in D minor (Op. 9) -- harmonized well with the choreographic surgings. The couples (Kristi Boone and Ricardo Torres, Mayo Sugano and Isaac Stappas, and Carrie Peterson and Brandon Gagon) remained unfazed by the passages of complicated partnering and, best of all, they looked like the worldly adults Ms. Weir surely had in mind.</p>
        <p>William Tuckett deliberately made dancers look like children in ''Schulwerk,'' to excerpts from the jaunty vocal and instrumental tunes Carl Orff composed to introduce students to musical fundamentals. Christina Gianinni's costumes -- short pants for the men, simple skirts for the women -- resembled school uniforms, and the cheeky choreography sent the dancers striding, gliding, bouncing and galloping. Mr. Tuckett, a British choreographer, is, like Ms. Weir, little known in the United States. These schoolyard games made one curious to see more by him.</p>
        <p>Robert Hill, a principal dancer of Ballet Theater, contributed ''Marimba,'' to live music by Minoru Miki, played by a percussion ensemble. The chimings, clatterings and rattlings sent the dancers moving with increased abandon until all were spinning dizzily. ''Marimba'' brought a satisfying program to an exhilarating conclusion.</p>
