        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>NORWAY: 80,000 STRIKE -- More than 80,000 workers went on strike, disrupting construction, printing, freight hauling, maritime transport, hotels and restaurants, and sparking hoarding of consumer goods by people fearing an extended walkout. The strike was called after members of Norway's main umbrella trade union turned down wage and benefit offers negotiated by their leaders with the employers' association. No new talks are set.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: POLICE ADMIT GUILT -- London's police force admitted in the High Court that some officers acted unlawfully when they confiscated flags and banners and otherwise blocked pro-Tibet demonstrators protesting a visit last October by President Jiang Zemin of China. The Free Tibet Campaign accused them of particularly heavy-handed tactics as Mr. Jiang rode in a carriage with Queen Elizabeth to Buckingham Palace. The Tibet group agreed to accept the police admissions and drop its legal challenge.</p>

        <p>SWEDEN: DISCO TRIAL BEGINS -- Four men went on trial in Goteborg on charges of setting a fire in October 1998 that killed 63 young partygoers in an overcrowded disco frequented by Eastern European immigrants. Prosecutors said the Iranian-born men, ages 19 to 21, acted because they were angry at having to pay $4.50 admission. They are charged with deliberately setting a fire to cause injury or death, an act punishable by up to eight years in jail.</p>
        <p>Warren Hoge (NYT)</p>
        <p>TURKEY: CHALLENGER QUITS -- Yildirim Akbulut, the main challenger to the coalition candidate for the presidency, said he was pulling out of the elections. Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit has urged legislators to select the reformist judge Ahmet Necdet Sezer, left. The barrier for electing the president is lowered to a simple majority of 276 in the 550-seat assembly in tomorrow's ballot, making Mr. Sezer almost certain to be elected.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>RUSSIA: SLAVIC REUNION -- President-elect Vladimir V. Putin met with the leaders of Ukraine and Belarus at a World War II battleground in western Russia, the first time the three have met since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Mr. Putin underscored the nations' Slavic heritage and inaugurated a memorial to the Battle of Kursk, a huge tank battle. ''We are one family,'' Mr. Putin said. ''We have common historic roots, a common fate, history, culture.'' But there are many divisions among the three: Ukraine, for instance, is determined to stay independent.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: PRI FINED -- Based on evidence that President Ernesto Zedillo's party, known as the PRI, illegally siphoned at least $2.5 million from the treasury of the northern state of Nuevo Leon, the autonomous government agency that organizes elections in Nuevo Leon fined the party $5 million. The PRI said it would appeal the decision. Several party officials still face criminal prosecution in the case. The state has been governed by the opposition National Action Party since 1997.</p>
        <p>Sam Dillon (NYT)</p>
        <p>ARGENTINA: ASKING FORGIVENESS -- President Fernando de la Rua said Argentina must ask forgiveness ''because Nazi criminals sought by justice entered or infiltrated our country and lived here alongside Holocaust survivors'' over many years. Adolf Eichmann, kidnapped by Israeli intelligence agents in 1960 and later hanged, and the concentration camp doctor Josef Mengele were among 40,000 Germans attracted by President Juan Peron's open-door policy.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>BRAZIL: PEASANT PROTEST -- A protester was reported to have been killed in a clash with the police after the Rural Landless Workers Movement, a radical peasant group, occupied government buildings in more than a dozen states, demanding that the government accelerate the distribution of land to the poor and provide more credit to farmworkers. CHILE: PINOCHET RULING SET -- An appeals court said it would meet May 24 to decide whether Gen. Augusto Pinochet can be stripped of his immunity and put on trial for human rights abuses during his 1973-1990 rule. The general currently cannot face trial because he changed the Constitution in 1980 to give all presidents who served six years the right to become a senator for life with immunity from prosecution.</p>
        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>PAKISTAN: 3 HELD IN SHARIF CASE -- The police have arrested three activists from the Muttahida Qaumi Movement in the March 10 slaying of Iqbal Raad, a lawyer who had been representing the ousted prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, in his hijacking case. The movement's leaders immediately declared that the charges were false.</p>
        <p>Barry Bearak (NYT)</p>
        <p>MALAYSIA: PAPER SUES -- The newspaper of Malaysia's opposition Islamic Party said it was taking legal action to try to force the government to ease a publishing restriction that it called politically motivated. Harakah, published by the opposition Parti Islam se-Malaysia, said it would ask the High Court to compel Home Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, above, to reverse an order limiting publication to twice a month from twice a week.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>ISRAEL: NEW SHAS CASE -- Aryeh Deri, the former leader of the Shas political party, who was convicted last year of corruption for personally profiting from his government jobs, went on trial in a separate case. He is charged with ensuring that his party profited from his positions as interior minister and deputy interior minister by directing money to Shas institutions through local city governments. Mr. Deri pleaded not guilty, although he does not dispute many of the facts, only the interpretation of them as crimes.</p>
        <p>Deborah Sontag (NYT)</p>
        <p>ISRAEL: U.S. ROLE GROWS -- American peace envoys began ratcheting up their involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks as they directly took part in final-status talks in Israel for the first time. In the Red Sea city of Eilat, Dennis Ross, the lead envoy, said the two sides were entering a ''new and intensive'' phase of deliberations that should indicate, over the next six to eight weeks, whether a framework agreement is possible.</p>

        <p>KUWAIT: PUPPET PREMIER SENTENCED -- A Kuwaiti who served as puppet prime minister after Iraq invaded in 1990 was convicted of treason and sentenced to be hanged. The court said a desire for personal gain led Alaa Hussein, 41, to take on the role. The court began hearing Mr. Hussein's case after he returned from exile saying he wanted to prove his innocence. He and his family lived in Iraq and Turkey until 1998, when Norway granted them asylum. He was sentenced to death in absentia in 1993.</p>

        <p>AFRICA  MOZAMBIQUE: CALL FOR HELP -- Emphasizing the need for urgent decisions, President Joaquim Chissano presented a plan to international donors in Rome for rebuilding his country, which was hit by devastating floods this year. He appealed for $450 million to get the country back on its feet. ''This help is required now and not tomorrow,'' he said. ''So we appeal for generosity and urgency.''</p>
        <p>Elizabetta Povoledo (NYT)</p>
        <p>ZAMBIA: KAUNDA CONFESSION -- One of two men charged with the murder of the son of former President Kenneth Kaunda broke down and confessed in the High Court in Lusaka. ''The particulars of the offense are true, and I do not want to trouble the court,'' Moses Mulenga told a stunned court. ''I am pleading guilty.'' Maj. Wezi Kaunda was shot dead outside his house last November by four gunmen, who then sped off in his car. A codefendant, Amon Banda, pleaded not guilty.</p>
        <p>(Agence France-Presse)</p>
        <p>MOROCCO: WOMEN'S RIGHTS -- The Socialist-led government said it would set up a body including Islamic scholars to seek a compromise on a plan to give more rights to women. The draft plan, unveiled last year, set off a heated debate between liberal activists and Islamic fundamentalists who denounced it as ''a ticket to prostitution.''</p>
