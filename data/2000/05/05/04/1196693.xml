        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I take issue with your April 27 editorial ''Sewage Treatment Delays.'' The  Department of Environmental Protection's waste water treatment plant upgrade program is part of New York City's comprehensive approach to protecting the drinking-water supply. The program is a complex undertaking involving the financing, design and construction of equipment and process upgrades at 102 waste water treatment facilities, not under the city's control, in the upstate watershed. These facilities will comply with the city's new watershed regulations and will incorporate treatment technology that will remove 95 percent of pollutants.</p>

        <p>The agency is carrying out the program over five years as called for by the 1997 watershed memorandum of agreement. It reflects an unparalleled effort to keep the city's drinking water safe.</p>
