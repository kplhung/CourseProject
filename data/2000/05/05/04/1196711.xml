        <p>Interest rates shot higher yesterday after the Federal Reserve reported that wages were rising across the country and investors wondered if that news would make the central bank more aggressive in its effort to slow economic growth.</p>
        <p>The report on economic conditions in Federal Reserve Districts around the country said that ''there were more frequent reports of intensifying wage pressures as shortages of workers persisted in all districts.''</p>
        <p>The Fed report also said economic growth was moderate to strong across the country. That assessment was re-enforced by the report that factory orders jumped a higher-than-expected 2.2 percent in March.</p>
        <p>The new information on inflationary pressures comes after the report of a surprisingly sharp jump in consumer prices, excluding food and energy, in March and an increase in total worker compensation in the first quarter. Together the reports have increased speculation that the Federal Reserve may decide to raise its short-term interest rate target by a half of a percentage point when policymakers meet May 16.</p>
        <p>William C. J. McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, noted the rise in inflation in March in a speech yesterday and said ''we have to keep especially alert now.''</p>
        <p>In the Treasury market, the investor concern was reflected in a jump in the yield on the two-year note, which is sensitive to expected policy moves by the Federal Reserve. The yield rose to 6.74 percent, from 6.68 percent Tuesday, and is the highest it has been in five years. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 5/32, to 99 9/32.</p>
        <p>This was a sharp rise in yield given the fact that the Treasury announced yesterday that it would reduce its issuance of two-year notes as part of its program to cut government borrowing as the budget surplus grows. A cut in issuance normally encourages buying.</p>
        <p>The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 6.39 percent, from 6.30 percent on Tuesday. The price fell 21/32, to 100 26/32. The yield on the 30-year bond climbed to 6.11 percent from 6.01 percent on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Until now most forecasters had said they thought the Fed would raise its interest rate target just a quarter of a point, which would be the sixth such move since June. That would bring the Federal funds rate, the overnight rate on loans between banks to 6.25 percent.</p>
        <p>Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, said if Fed policy makers were meeting today, ''knowing what they know today, they would probably go half a percentage point.''</p>
        <p>William Dudley, chief economist at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, did not want to predict the size of the next Fed move. But he did say that the strength of the economy and the new signs of inflationary pressure would force the Fed to push interest rates higher than he had thought.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to stake my reputation on predicting the May move,'' he said. ''But I want to stress that the Fed has a lot more work to do.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday he raised his forecast for how high the Fed will have to push the federal funds rate. Mr. Dudley is now predicting that it will be up to 7 percent by the end of the year, a quarter of a point higher, and at 7.5 percent in 12 months.</p>
