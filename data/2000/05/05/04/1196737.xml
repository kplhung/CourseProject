        <p>His legs overruling his heart a day after he became an American citizen, Khalid Khannouchi announced yesterday that he was too injured to compete in the Olympic marathon trials on Sunday in Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>It was one of the few smart decisions made in an immigration case that has included bad advice from lawyers, miscalculation by his agent-wife, grandstanding by politicians and abandonment of the runner by the shoe company he endorses.</p>
        <p>Ankle and hamstring injuries aggravated at the London Marathon on April 16 threatened the longevity of Khannouchi's career, his trainer, Gerard Hartmann, said yesterday. But it should never have come to this. If his pursuit of citizenship had been conducted as professionally as his racing, Khannouchi would not have had to run the London Marathon, his American dream would not have become an athletic nightmare and American chances for a marathon gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, would not have been reduced to zero.</p>
        <p>At least, after a day, the Moroccan-born Khannouchi was enough of an American not to let outside pressures force him to run a race that would have been dangerous for his career, one that involves a classic immigrant story of working his way from dishwasher to worldrecord-holder in six years.</p>
        <p>''I feel very sorry,'' Khannouchi said, tears welling in his eyes at a Manhattan news conference, a day after being sworn in as a United States citizen. ''I feel bad for the people that really worked hard on the case. I'm looking toward the case realistically. I don't want to be pushed and make some bad mistakes.''</p>
        <p>Enough bad mistakes have already been made. The first was not listening to Craig Masback, the chief executive of track and field's national governing body, who told the Khannouchis in the fall of 1998 that legislative pursuit of citizenship would be fruitless. In recent memory, not a single athlete has ever received expedited citizenship through a private bill in Congress. Why would Khannouchi be any different, Masback advised.</p>
        <p>Masback recommended the use of a naturalization provision, normally used by the military, that grants citizenship to spouses of American citizens working abroad for American companies. The French soccer player David Regis had used this provision to become a United States citizen for the 1998 World Cup.</p>
        <p>Instead, Sandra Khannouchi, Khalid's agent and wife, listened to lawyers who suggested they pursue expedited citizenship with the New York Congressional help of Representative Sue Kelly and Senator Charles E. Schumer.</p>
        <p>''That was bad advice,'' Sandra Khannouchi, who lives with her husband in Ossining, N.Y., said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The matter devolved into a political fight between Schumer's office and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Schumer's office blamed the I.N.S. for temporarily freezing Khannouchi's case when the agent who interviewed him was charged with bribery in another case. The I.N.S. charged that Schumer was handling the case for political gain and that, even if the case had not been frozen, Khannouchi would not have been eligible through conventional means to apply for citizenship until September 2000, weeks before the Oct. 1 Olympic marathon and too late to have competed in the Olympic trials.</p>
        <p>Sandra Khannouchi said she was hesitant to ask anyone for a job overseas, not wanting special treatment for her husband. But having an international job for a year or so would have been far more legitimate than the flimsy job she took in Madrid in March with a San Diego-based company called Elite Racing. That move was desperately calculated to gain citizenship for Khalid Khannouchi.</p>
        <p>New Balance, the shoe company that Khannouchi endorses, declined to provide a job for Sandra Khannouchi, saying the spousal immigration provision seemed a contrivance and a loophole. In fact, it is not a loophole, and it need not be a contrivance. If New Balance objected to a job, fine. But the company should have at least pointed Khannouchi toward helpful legal advice. ''We didn't feel it was appropriate for us to step in and get involved,'' said James Tompkins, the president of New Balance.</p>
        <p>Why not? Khannouchi is the company's most accomplished and visible runner. Instead, New Balance engaged in the hypocrisy of conducting yesterday's news conference at one of its stores, wanting publicity without responsibility.</p>
        <p>Khannouchi is not without fault. He did not tell his Houston-based lawyer, Harry Gee, that he was running the London Marathon. And he ran with a prior ankle injury. ''It's certainly contradictory, running in London and the desire to run in the Olympic trials,'' Gee said.</p>
        <p>Gee got involved in March after reading of the case in a magazine. Two months later, Khannouchi has his citizenship but no chance to run in the Olympic marathon, a missed opportunity for which many must accept blame.</p>
