        <p>For Nassau Republicans, the problem is not just that they failed to regain control of the County Legislature in the special election that was held in Port Washington on Tuesday. The problem is also how far short of the goal they fell.</p>
        <p>In a district where Republicans still outnumber Democrats on paper but often cross party lines in the voting booths, more than three-quarters of those who cast ballots on Tuesday voted for non-Republicans. A Green Party candidate did nearly as well as the Republican candidate.</p>
        <p>Anger over the county's fiscal woes, which fueled a voter revolt that ended decades of Republican rule last November, does not seem to have abated. The question now is what impact it will have as the county's once-unstoppable Republican Party prepares presidential, Senate and State Legislature elections this November.</p>
        <p>''The Republicans have always counted on Nassau County, and now they've taken two straight shots and November is coming up, said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute.''</p>
        <p>Republican leaders are particularly concerned about maintaining their 36-to-25 majority in the State Senate; Nassau County has five Republican State Senators facing re-election, some representing areas considered vulnerable in the past.</p>
        <p>Joseph N. Mondello, the chairman of the county's Republican Party, cautioned against giving too much weight to Tuesday's election, noting that the district has been voting Democratic for years and that the seat that was being filled belonged to the late Barbara Johnson, a Democrat who had held it since the County Legislature was created in 1996.</p>
        <p>Still, he acknowledged that the voters' anger could prove a problem if nothing is done to fix the county's finances soon. ''They want this problem solved, they're not happy with anybody, but they're more unhappy with the Republicans at this point.''</p>
        <p>Craig M. Johnson, who won the election to fill the seat left vacant by the March death of Ms. Johnson, his mother, got 6,774 votes. The Republican candidate, Linda H. Green, won 2,650, and the Green Party candidate, Benjamin L. Zwirn, got 2,278.</p>
        <p>The vote was crucial because Ms. Johnson's death had left the Legislature with nine Democrats and nine Republicans as the county tried to right its fiscal mess. In Nassau County, where the parties tend to vote in lockstep, this meant deadlock.</p>
        <p>Now, attention has shifted to the November elections. ''The big question is, 'Was this a residual effect of last November, and, if so, will that residual effect dissipate between now and next November?' '' said John V. N. Klein, a former Republican county executive in Suffolk.</p>
        <p>Thomas P. DiNapoli, the State Assemblyman who is chairman of the county's Democratic Party, does not think it will. ''I think there's an anger out there that's not going to dissipate by November,'' he said.</p>
