        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's announcement last week that he has prostate cancer has forced undecided voters to look with new eyes at the man whose unyielding personality they thought they knew so well.</p>
        <p>''We may find out that there's another side to him,'' said Dave Temkin, a telecommunications expert, who not long ago worried that Mr. Giuliani's controlling temperament could be disqualifying in a collaborative body like the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Temkin's worries were shared by many of the undecided voters The New York Times is following as they move toward a decision in the Senate race in New York. One of those voters, Karl Schwartz, had been questioning the mayor's stubborn reaction to a series of police shootings of unarmed black men. Another, Doug Taggart, was dismayed at the mayor's characterization of federal agents as storm troopers after the seizure of Elian Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>Mr. Temkin, Mr. Schwartz, Mr. Taggart and others in the group culled from New York Times/CBS polls, were showing signs of inching away from Mr. Giuliani and taking a kinder view of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton. But the mayor's illness stopped them in their tracks.</p>
        <p>Already, Mr. Giuliani's response to his illness has softened his hard edges, made him seem more like the average Joe, they say. And they will watch how he handles adversity in the coming weeks and months.</p>
        <p>''At times like this you find out what a person is made of,'' Mr. Temkin said. ''How he comes through this will have a lasting impact on people's viewpoint of him, not as a politician but as a human being -- and that has been his weaker side.''</p>
        <p>''You learn that there are things we can't control,'' said Mr. Temkin, whose mother had a recent recurrence of breast cancer after more than 30 years. ''How Giuliani works through this situation will be a major indicator of how he reacts when he's not in the driver's seat.''</p>
        <p>To some extent, the mayor does control what treatment he chooses and whether or not he stays in the race, decisions he has said he will make within two weeks. All the voters interviewed applauded Mr. Giuliani's good-humored and straight-forward announcement. ''He was very winning and amiable,'' said Mr. Taggart, vice president of a financial services concern.</p>
        <p>But these voters are divided on whether a Senate contender can take an extended leave from the campaign trail, as Joe Torre did from the Yankee dugout during his treatment for prostate cancer last year, and still remain a viable candidate.</p>
        <p>Tom Smith, who works at a Wal-Mart near Saugerties, said he thought a two-month absence, comparable to Mr. Torre's recovery from surgery, would hand the Senate seat to Mrs. Clinton. ''He'd never be able to make up the ground,'' Mr. Smith said, noting Mr. Giuliani's recent slippage in the polls and his desultory campaigning, especially upstate.</p>
        <p>Tom Beck, a Long Island educator, agreed. ''In today's society, if you're out of the loop for two days, you're behind,'' he said. ''If he is out that long, he owes it to the party and the people who support him to fold his tent.''</p>
        <p>Taking a contrary view are Bob and Cathy Harrison, a school teacher and a nurse, respectively, from upstate Amsterdam. The couple said that Mr. Giuliani could flood the airwaves with commercials, make limited appearances and lean on surrogates like Senator John McCain.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Giuliani can find a treatment that lasts just two months or so, then he can be ''back in campaign mode by the middle of July,'' Mr. Harrison said. ''That's time enough for the real nitty-gritty.''</p>
        <p>Abashed at thinking about who is up and who is down at such a sensitive time, Mr. Harrison offered a prediction: ''When he comes back, it could be like David Letterman after his heart bypass. His ratings jumped sky-high.''</p>
        <p>The trickier task may be Mrs. Clinton's. ''Can she go for the jugular?'' Mr. Beck asked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harrison speculated that the upshot could be an uncommonly civil contest. ''She can campaign without being mean,'' he said. ''She should be addressing the issues, anyway, not attacking Giuliani.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz sees another benefit, more profound in his view. A computer consultant who lives on Staten Island, Mr. Schwartz spends most of his time researching experimental treatments for his wife, who has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the type of cancer that killed Roger Maris, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and King Hussein.</p>
        <p>''On a personal level, it hit me hard and I feel for him more than anyone who just reads about cancer could feel,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''But on a practical level, I'm glad if this sad event opens the eyes of Americans who are still in denial.''</p>
        <p>''So Rudy has cancer,'' he continued. ''Now it's not abstract for him. Maybe he will ask himself why he and so many others are getting cancer today. Maybe he will think twice about diesel buses, and the quality of water, pesticides in food, the effects of plastic wrap. I hope he becomes wiser about the long-term health of the planet and the state of New York, sees the connection and acts on it.''</p>

        <p>This is the third article in a series following a group of New York State voters from diverse backgrounds as they make up their minds on which candidate to support for the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>The previous articles were about the information already available about the candidates and the voters' first impressions.</p>
