        <p>A convicted drug dealer was arrested yesterday and charged with making threats against a livery driver to stop him from testifying in the shooting of another driver on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Detectives are also investigating whether the man arrested yesterday, Edgar Garcia, 21, and the gunman who wounded the driver on Sunday had robbed other livery cab drivers, an investigator involved in the case said yesterday. They said that Mr. Garcia had been out on parole from conspiracy charges for his role in a Lower East Side drug gang.</p>
        <p>The arrest of Mr. Garcia, who was charged with third-degree witness tampering and gun possession, came a little more than 24 hours after the police said he and another man walked into the Allen Car Service on the Lower East Side Monday night. He offered $6,000 to an employee to ensure that no one would testify against the suspect in Sunday's shooting, Luis Soto, 20, and warned that other drivers from the service would be shot if anyone did testify, the police and the manager said.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'We are offering $6,000 if you guys drop the charges on the shooter,' '' said the employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''And he said if we didn't accept it they were going to harm another driver.'' The employee told Mr. Garcia that he would have to return to the car service at 154 Allen Street the next day to talk to the owner.</p>
        <p>The police were soon called. Detectives wired the livery service office for video and sound and an undercover officer was stationed inside, officials said. But Mr. Garcia and the other man, who was not identified, did not return, the police said.</p>
        <p>Seventh Precinct detectives, however, were able to learn a nickname for one of the men, who was known on the street as Eggie, and later found a photograph of him on an East Village street, said Inspector Michael Collins, who oversaw the investigation for the Manhattan Detective Borough.</p>
        <p>A detective recognized the street as one in the Ninth Precinct and showed the photograph to detectives there, who recognized Mr. Garcia because he had been arrested there several times, Inspector Collins said. They obtained a search warrant for Mr. Garcia's address at 199 Avenue B, where they arrested him and two other men about 1:50 a.m. yesterday, the inspector said. The two other men were released.</p>
        <p>When the police entered the apartment, Mr. Garcia fled to the roof and was arrested a few minutes later behind the building, Inspector Collins said. He said Mr. Garcia was wearing a weight training vest -- a heavy canvas garment with metal plates fitted inside -- that investigators believed he was using to protect himself from possible gunfire. The police also recovered two loaded revolvers, a .38-caliber and a .357 Magnum, near where he was arrested and said he had discarded the guns just before he was taken into custody.</p>
        <p>Mr. Soto, the suspect in the Sunday shooting, was charged with second-degree attempted murder, first-degree assault and other crimes. A grand jury is expected to hear testimony in the case this week, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garcia, who has an arrest record dating back to 1993, was on parole from his guilty plea in a 1996 drug case brought by the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, against the Champion Crew. Mr. Morgenthau called the group ''one of the most profitable, entrepreneurial and enterprising drug gangs ever prosecuted'' by his office.</p>
        <p>Sentenced to three years to nine years in prison, Mr. Garcia, characterized as a worker bee by prosecutors, was released on parole from a shock incarceration program in February 1999, but failed to participate in a required drug and alcohol treatment program and was returned to prison, where he was released again Feb. 29, officials said.</p>
        <p>While livery drivers praised the arrests, hundreds of cabbies massed outside the Criminal Courthouse in Brooklyn yesterday to condemn a judge who granted bail to three suspects in the murder of a livery driver on Friday, the ninth such killing this year.</p>
        <p>The protesters, who arrived in a flotilla of honking cabs, railed against the decision by Judge David I. Schmidt of Criminal Court to set bail at $100,000 each for Felicia Field, Charles Rhodes and Tyreek Cross, who were charged with killing the driver, Cesar Manuel Lopez. David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the Office of Court Administration, said none of the suspects had made bail.</p>
