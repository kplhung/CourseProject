        <p>ROTH-Barbara R. Of New York, died on May 1, after a long illness. She is survived by her husband, Paul G. Roth, her daughter, Alexandra O'Mara and her husband, Kevin O'Mara, and three grandchildren, Nicholas, Ian and Peter O'Mara. Whether as a wife, mother or a friend, her generosity of spirit and love of life provided joy and comfort to all who knew her, from business colleagues to her students in after school literacy classes. She was the center of her family, with an endless capacity for patience and love. In return, she was much loved, and will be much missed. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the American Cancer Society.</p>
