        <p>AS the Devils practiced Tuesday, he stood in the aisle halfway up the stands at Continental Arena and watched, his hands behind his back.</p>
        <p>''I can't talk now,'' he said. ''After playoffs, call me in Vancouver and I talk.''</p>
        <p>Strong and sturdy in a dark sports jacket over a dark T-shirt and dark slacks, Vladimir Bure looked and sounded as if he had just stepped out of the James Bond thriller, ''From Russia With Love.'' And in a way he had. But by trying to be inconspicuous, he was all the more mysterious.</p>
        <p>''Please ask New Jersey Devils' management about me,'' he said in a friendly but firm voice. ''I can't talk now. After playoffs, call me.''</p>
        <p>Maybe he prefers to be mysterious because he's Pavel Bure's father, maybe because he's not officially a member of the Devils organization.</p>
        <p>But Vladimir Bure is not a mystery to the four Devils players who perspired early and often last summer in the strenuous off-season conditioning program he supervised near the South Mountain Arena in West Orange, the Devils' practice rink.</p>
        <p>''It's the hardest thing I've ever done,'' said Scott Gomez, the 20-year-old center, ''but I probably wouldn't be here if I hadn't done it.''</p>
        <p>Maybe more Devils should have done it. Gomez, who is expected to be voted the Calder Trophy as the National Hockey League's rookie of the year after a season with 19 goals and 51 assists, scored his third goal of the playoffs last night, but the Maple Leafs won, 3-2, to square their conference semifinal series, 2-2, in the Stanley Cup countdown.</p>
        <p>''Vladdy told us,'' said the rookie defenseman Colin White, whose goal provided last Saturday's 1-0 victory, ''that we would feel the value of the six-week workouts late in the season and in the playoffs. He was right.''</p>
        <p>Sergei Brylin, the 26-year-old Russian center with one playoff goal so far, and Pierre Dagenais, a left wing whose 35 goals led the Albany River Rats farm team during the recent season, were the others who stretched, sprinted, ran, then played tennis and basketball under Bure six hours a day for six weeks last summer.</p>
        <p>''The whole object was stamina,'' Gomez said. ''After a 30-second rest, to be able to go at full strength.''</p>
        <p>Once a Soviet swimmer in three Olympics, Vladimir Bure coached his son Pavel in Russia, arranged the son's shadowy departure to the Vancouver Canucks in 1991, then acted as the son's agent, personal trainer and bodyguard in Vancouver before their breakup. For the past year and a half, father and son have been estranged, not even speaking to each other.</p>
        <p>The father has been quoted as saying that some of Pavel's friends, reportedly connected to the Russian mafia, are ''very bad.''</p>
        <p>It is the father's reputation as a personal trainer that prompted Slava Fetisov, a Devils assistant coach who once was a Soviet hockey icon, to recommend to Lou Lamoriello, the Devils' president and general manager, that Vladimir Bure be hired last summer to condition younger players.</p>
        <p>''Vladdy is very good at what he does,'' Lamoriello said. ''He's not on our payroll now but as a reward for what he did last summer as a consultant, we invited him to the playoffs.''</p>
        <p>As the Devils swept the Florida Panthers in the first round, Vladimir Bure acknowledged rooting for the Devils against the Panthers, for whom his son Pavel had scored a league-leading 58 goals during the season.</p>
        <p>''Vladdy went to Florida and Toronto with us,'' Gomez said. ''When we're here, he's been staying in Clifton with me.''</p>
        <p>Once a famous Russian family of watchmakers, the Bures have a long sports history.</p>
        <p>Vladimir's father, Valery, was a Soviet water-polo goaltender before he was exiled by Stalin to Siberia where Vladimir was born, in Norilsk, north of the Arctic Circle.</p>
        <p>After Stalin died in 1953, the family returned to Moscow where Vladimir developed into an Olympic swimmer. He earned four Olympic medals, one silver and three bronze, in the Summer Games of 1968, 1972 (where he swam against Mark Spitz) and 1976.</p>
        <p>Divorced in 1983, Vladimir Bure is remarried with a 4-year-old daughter, a stepsister to his two N.H.L. sons, Pavel and Valery (whose 35 goals led the Calgary Flames this season).</p>
        <p>But these days at least, Vladimir Bure's heart is with the Devils.</p>
        <p>Even if he prefers to be mysterious.</p>
