        <p>Anthony Jones was defiant last summer when the police arrested him and accused him of beating and raping a woman underneath the Coney Island Boardwalk. He spit at the officers, they said; he threw punches. It took six officers from the 60th Precinct to get him under control. Mr. Jones told them he knew nothing about the attack.</p>
        <p>But the police thought they had a case. Mr. Jones, 42, matched the description of the attacker and was caught just blocks from where the assault occurred. A background check soon showed that he had a record as a serial sex offender.</p>
        <p>At the moment of the arrest, Mr. Jones's victim was being examined at Coney Island Hospital. The police expected that the hospital would follow well-established protocols and take samples of the attacker's semen and saliva from the victim, and send them to the City Medical Examiner's office to isolate the attacker's DNA.</p>
        <p>The case of the People vs. Anthony Jones was undone, however, by something prosecutors now describe as an astonishing oversight. Three months after the attack, the city's forensic scientists opened the sealed box of evidence and found no swabs or smears inside. Coney Island Hospital never sent any.</p>
        <p>Because there was no DNA evidence, Mr. Jones's initial defiance  has been borne out. He was sentenced yesterday, as part of a plea agreement, to two to four years in prison on a single count of second-degree assault. He could have been sentenced to 25 years to life if convicted of rape.</p>
        <p>DNA has become an invaluable tool for solving sex crimes, particularly in cases in which the accused and the victim are strangers. But in this case, the victim, a prostitute, heroin addict and frequent emergency room visitor, never had that chance. Prosecutors say that since she was a member of the underclass, she was treated poorly, with extraordinary repercussions.</p>
        <p>''The tragedy here is the hospital didn't know what it was doing,'' said John Nolan, an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, who prosecuted the case and agreed to the plea. ''The victim was a victim twice. Once by him, and once by the hospital.''</p>
        <p>Coney Island Hospital declined to discuss the case in detail, citing legal concerns.</p>
        <p>''We performed the test, and it was used as evidence in a criminal proceeding,'' said Barbara Sullivan, a hospital spokeswoman. ''Therefore it is inappropriate for us to comment.''</p>
        <p>But among the police, prosecutors, victims' advocates and the victim's family, the refrain was the same. They said the 31-year-old woman was denied the meticulous examination that could have given her justice.</p>
        <p>And they said the hospital's failure led to the state's compromise with a dangerous predator who could have been sent away for life.</p>
        <p>''We'll see him again,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir said yesterday. ''Unfortunately, there will be another victim.''</p>
        <p>Anthony Jones's police record is unquestionably chilling. It shows an attack in Arizona in 1978 in which a woman was raped and stabbed repeatedly; one of her fingers was cut off. It shows that he sodomized an elderly woman in 1990 in the basement of a Manhattan church.</p>
        <p>The latest victim was attacked the day after his release from prison, where he was twice denied parole because he did not attend therapeutic sex-offender counseling and because he had attempted to solicit sex from another inmate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones is to be released again in 2003. The authorities and the victim's family said they expected him to strike again.</p>
        <p>The outcome was particularly disturbing, the police and prosecutors said, because the case seemed to have a fast start.</p>
        <p>On the morning of July 17, 1999, the victim told the police that she had been taken from the street, placed in a chokehold and dragged under the Boardwalk, where she was raped. The police arrested Mr. Jones within two hours.</p>
        <p>The initial identification was strong. Mr. Jones is 6 feet 2, weighs 210 pounds and wears dreadlocks and a beard.</p>
        <p>And upon his arrest, he was found to be carrying a pair of eyeglasses with a broken frame and an inmate identification card -- two items the victim had reported seeing him drop and retrieve during the attack. The woman selected him almost instantly from a six-man police lineup, even though the police covered the men's heads with shower caps, so Mr. Jones's dreadlocks would not be seen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones was indicted two weeks later on multiple counts of rape, sexual misconduct, sexual abuse and assault, and single counts of unlawful imprisonment and attempted sodomy.</p>
        <p>But the case began to unravel on Oct. 21, when the medical examiner notified the prosecutors that there were no DNA swabs or smears.</p>
        <p>Because the hospital declined detailed comment, precisely what happened in the emergency room is unclear. But according to prosecutors' notes and medical records, the physician did not take the full array of forensic samples from the woman, and the two samples that were taken were not submitted for genetic checks.</p>
        <p>In an internal memo, one of the prosecutors wrote: ''A resident unprofessionally did the exam.''</p>
        <p>Julie L. Schwartz, deputy chief of the Brooklyn sex crimes bureau, said that in her 11 years as a prosecutor she has never heard of such samples being lost. And victims' advocates said the oversight was egregious, in part because evidence kits come with printed instructions, and in part because the samples often become the most important part of the examination.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones's defense lawyer, Robert J. Collini, said he also was frustrated by the absence of forensic evidence. ''My client's contention from the beginning was that the DNA test would have been exculpatory,'' Mr. Collini said.</p>
        <p>''Whether that's true or not, we'll never know, because there was no DNA to test.''</p>
        <p>Supreme Court Justice Frank J. Barbaro agreed, saying that because ''the evidence was not handled in a professional manner,'' he had no ability to divine the truth about a sexual predator.</p>
