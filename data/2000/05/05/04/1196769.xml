        <p>In a sharp exchange that gave the presidential campaign the intensity of a day in late October, Vice President Al Gore accused Gov. George W. Bush today of devising a ''secret plan'' that could bankrupt the Social Security system. Hours later, Mr. Bush tartly questioned the vice president's honesty and predicted that Mr. Gore's attacking style would soon backfire.</p>
        <p>Echoing a theme he has repeated often in recent days, Mr. Gore used a speech to union officials in New Jersey to assert that Mr. Bush, the likely Republican nominee, was quietly developing a ''risky'' plan to allow individual investment accounts in Social Security that would jeopardize millions of taxpayers' savings.</p>
        <p>''How does the Bush plan propose to deal with the bankruptcy of Social Security that his privatization scheme would cause?'' Mr. Gore told a gathering of A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials in Atlantic City. ''He doesn't even bother to provide an answer. He just smiles and goes on with the smug assumption that there's no need to share with you the details of what he wants to do.''</p>
        <p>Responding to Mr. Gore's cascade of attacks, Mr. Bush spent much of a plane flight this afternoon from Austin, Tex., to Palm Springs, Calif., telling reporters that the vice president had flatly misrepresented his record on a host of issues, ranging from the Texas budget to his positions on China and Russia to his crime-fighting policies.</p>
        <p>''Someone running for the highest office of the land should stick to the facts,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I think it is a pattern to say things, to stretch the truth. He's the man who said he invented the Internet.''</p>
        <p>Asked whether Mr. Gore's aggressive campaigning might work as well against him as it did against former Senator Bill Bradley during the Democratic primaries, Mr. Bush said he planned to respond faster and more forcefully than Mr. Bradley.</p>
        <p>''It's not going to work here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In fact, rather than being aggrieved by his opponent's attacks, Mr. Bush seemed somewhat amused by the constant salvos from the vice president, suggesting that Mr. Gore's strategy was self-defeating.  ''Pretty soon, it's going to have a corrosive effect on his campaign if he's not telling the truth,'' Mr. Bush said of Mr. Gore during the 78-minute airborne news conference. ''The fact that he relies on facts -- says things that are not factual -- are going to undermine his campaign.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''The more outrageous he gets, the more outrageous allegations he makes against me, the more skeptical people will become.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides clearly disagree. Privately, they contend that the slashing strategy they employed during the primaries will work again in the general election, provided they avoid the appearance of attacking Mr. Bush personally.</p>
        <p>They have done that, they argue, by focusing on issues like Social Security, tax cuts, health care and gun control.</p>
        <p>''The primaries showed that voters believe that vigorously debating your opponent on issues is considered fair play,'' said one adviser to Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also used his Atlantic City speech to discuss his own proposal for keeping the Social Security system solvent.</p>
        <p>Under that plan, he would use the system's surplus to pay down the national debt, which in turn would reduce the federal government's interest payments. Those savings would then be put back into the Social Security trust fund, keeping the system solvent for an additional 13 years or more.</p>
        <p>''I will devote all interest from debt reduction to shore up Social Security,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I think it is wrong to cut benefits, raise the retirement age or risk your retirement savings in a game of stock market roulette.''</p>
        <p>But that description amounted to one brief passage in a 35-minute speech that was devoted mainly to attacking Mr. Bush on a variety of fronts, particularly Social Security.</p>
        <p>Under the proposal floated by Mr. Bush's aides in recent days, taxpayers would be allowed to invest a small part of their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock or bond markets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides argue that such a plan would help taxpayers take advantage of the stock market's historic growth.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore asserted today that the plan would make the system vulnerable to huge market fluctuations that could hurt millions of retirees. And as he has repeatedly done in recent days, he suggested that Mr. Bush was charting a course that was ''reckless'' and ''irresponsible.''</p>
        <p>''To me, Social Security is more than a government program,'' he said. ''It is a solemn compact between the generations.'' Governor Bush, he added, ''seems to believe differently.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore asserted that Mr. Bush had ''left the door wide open'' to raising the retirement age for Social Security as a means of bolstering the system.</p>
        <p>That approach, he argued, would be harmful to people who do strenuous manual labor and physically cannot postpone retirement. And he accused Mr. Bush of wanting to cut Social Security spending to pay for a tax cut that Mr. Gore argues would favor the rich.</p>
        <p>''What about the waitress who's carrying a heavy tray, what about the longshoreman, what about the steelworker and the auto workers?'' he asked. ''When they get to the current retirement age, they don't want to be told that in order to finance some risky tax scheme for the wealthy, they are going to have to keep on working until they are 70 years old.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides acknowledge that he has not ruled out raising the retirement age. But they note that he has not formulated a detailed plan yet, only the general principles for one. Those include not increasing Social Security taxes, not cutting benefits and setting aside the Social Security surplus in a ''lockbox'' to make sure it is used only on Social Security.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Bush's lack of a detailed plan that caused Mr. Gore to accuse the Texas governor of devising a ''secret plan'' today.</p>
        <p>''He wants to spring it on you after the election,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Well, I think he may be underestimating the capacity of the American people to figure out for ourselves what the details of his secret plan would mean for each and every American.''</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Gore's barbs were meant to rattle Mr. Bush, they failed. Indeed, what was extraordinary about today's exchange was the almost delighted mood that Mr. Bush brought to his end of it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was on his way to California for several days of campaigning, including a fund-raiser in Palm Springs tonight for the Republican Party that was expected to bring in about $1 million.</p>
        <p>On the flight, Mr. Bush revealed a few more glimmers than usual of his obvious distaste for what he seems to see as Mr. Gore's desperation to be president.</p>
        <p>Usually, Mr. Bush does a more thorough job of pulling his punches when he is asked what he thinks about Mr. Gore as a person.</p>
        <p>After a reporter told Mr. Bush that Mr. Gore, whose first grandchild was born on the Fourth of July, sometimes says to Hispanic audiences that he hopes his second grandchild will be born on Cinco de Mayo, Mr. Bush muttered, ''Totally pathetic.''</p>
        <p>At another point, talking about his own desire for the presidency, Mr. Bush said: ''I'm willing to work for it. What I'm not willing to do is sell my soul to become the president.''</p>
        <p>Asked if Mr. Gore would do that, Mr. Bush arched an eyebrow and said, ''That's for you all to figure out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did not use the word ''lied,'' and when reporters did, he corrected them, coyly repeating again and again that he was simply setting the record straight and expressing his ''disappointment'' in Mr. Gore's behavior.</p>
        <p>But he did use the words disappointment or disappointed at least half a dozen times.</p>
        <p>''The vice president said I've never submitted a budget as governor of Texas'' said Mr. Bush, reciting the comments by Mr. Gore that he deemed untruthful. ''He talked about recidivism rates that were totally inaccurate numbers.''</p>
        <p>''He said I called China and Russia enemies,'' Mr. Bush added. ''Have I ever referred to China and Russia as enemies?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush shook his head and veered toward what he clearly intended to be a kind of emotional and moral high ground.</p>
        <p>''I just am disappointed and I think Americans will be disappointed when they find out the truth,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Their Own Words</p>
        <p>VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE</p>
        <p>Remarks at a convention of the New Jersey State A.F.L.-C.I.O. held yesterday in Atlantic City, N.J.:</p>
        <p>''Now we face a basic choice. Will we use our prosperity to lift up our working families and meet our responsibilities to our parents and to our children and make sure that no one is left behind? Or will we go back to where we were eight years ago?</p>
        <p>Will we roll the dice in the same casino economics that devastated our economy and hurt working families? Does anyone in this room think we should go back to the union-busting, job-destroying, budget-busting policies of the Bush-Quayle years. I don't think so. . . .</p>
        <p>There are deep and profound differences between Governor Bush and me. Not personal differences, but real differences on the issues. I believe America has to put its fundamental responsibilities first. We have to pay down our debt, we have to save Social Security, we have to lift up working families.</p>
        <p>George W. Bush believes instead that our top priority should be a reckless $2 trillion tax giveaway lavishing more on those who already have the most. . . .</p>
        <p>His tax plan is bigger than anything Newt Gingrich ever dreamed of proposing. That may be why Governor Bush does not set aside a single penny for Medicare. And I believe his approach to Social Security is even more irresponsible.''</p>
        <p>GEORGE W. BUSH</p>
        <p>Speaking yesterday aboard his campaign plane en route to California:</p>
        <p>''The vice president said I've never submitted a budget as governor of Texas. He talked about recidivism rates that were totally inaccurate numbers. . . .</p>
        <p>The more outrageous he gets, the more outrageous allegations he makes against me, the more skeptical people will become. I will respond. But I'm going to respond in a way that doesn't allow him to drag the process down. One of our jobs in this campaign is to make clear what the facts are.''</p>
