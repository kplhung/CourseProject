        <p>The London and Frankfurt stock exchanges announced plans today for a merger as well as an alliance with the technology-heavy Nasdaq stock market of the United States. London and Frankfurt hope to build a pan-European trading heavyweight and a 24-hour global market in new-economy stocks -- both unthinkable prospects only a few years ago.</p>
        <p>The British-German exchange would be Europe's biggest by far and the world's fourth largest.</p>
        <p>The announcement offered the most significant evidence to date of a sea change in European markets. The shift has been driven by a clamor among investors for less expensive trading systems, a challenge from Internet-based and electronic trading systems, and a perception that Europe has become a single investment arena since the introduction of a unified currency -- the euro.</p>
        <p>The development also showed how far Frankfurt has progressed in its challenge to London as Europe's prime financial center. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>Just six weeks after the exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels announced a rival European combination called Euronext, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Borse, which operates the Frankfurt exchange, said their merged company -- called the iX, for International Exchanges -- would have its administrative headquarters in London and would carve the European market into two parts. Blue-chip stocks would be listed in London, while a  market in high-growth technology stocks linked to the Nasdaq would be run from Frankfurt.</p>
        <p>And Eurex, the Deutsche Borse's market for derivatives -- complex financial contracts whose values are derived from underlying assets like stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies -- would continue to be run from Germany as part of the combined exchange. The role of Eurex, the world's biggest derivatives market, in the pan-European exchange could effectively isolate the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, a chief rival.</p>
        <p>Participants said the Frankfurt-London merger would be completed by the fall, but the replacement of London's trading system with Germany's advanced technology is not expected until at least some time in the first half of 2001.</p>
        <p>Frank Zarb, the chief executive of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq market, told a news conference today that the opening of a Nasdaq subsidiary in Tokyo next month would enable investors to connect with both European and American markets, offering ''a 24-hour clock for the high-growth companies.''</p>
        <p>''The markets,'' he said, ''will follow the sun for the biggest companies.''</p>
        <p>The alliance with the Nasdaq will bring together London's techMARK and Germany's Neuer Markt, technology-heavy exchanges that list newer stocks, as the core of a new high-technology exchange. Nasdaq and iX are to be equal shareholders in that venture, which will be incorporated in London and operated from Frankfurt. Mr. Zarb indicated that the deal had pre-empted the Nasdaq's plans to set up a separate European trading system.</p>
        <p>The negotiations on the Frankfurt-London tie-up had been going on almost two years.</p>
        <p>While the rival Paris-dominated Euronext market will trade stocks valued at some $2.2 trillion, the iX will group equities with a combined value of $4.29 trillion. By way of contrast, the New York Stock Exchange trades shares valued at $11.24 trillion, while the Nasdaq's equities are valued at $6.23 trillion, and Tokyo's are about $4.46 trillion, according to the International Federation of Stock Exchanges.</p>
        <p>In Europe, the iX would clearly dominate, the partners said today, particularly because smaller markets in Milan and Madrid also want to join it.</p>
        <p>Without Milan and Madrid, the iX said it would still control 53 percent of European equity trading, 81 percent of the market in high-growth stocks and 56 percent of the European derivatives market.</p>
        <p>''This is the first step to an integrated pan-European market,'' said Don Cruickshank, the newly appointed chairman of the London Stock Exchange, who will be chairman of the iX. He is expected to hold talks with both the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange and Euronext on expanding the Frankfurt-London combination.</p>
        <p>Caroline Denton, a spokeswoman for London International Financial, said the exchange would not reject an approach from the iX out of hand but also felt it could survive on its own.</p>
        <p>And Euronext shrugged off the new combination, saying it proved ''we took the right decision,'' according to Olivier Lefebvre, president of Brussels exchange.</p>
        <p>The new company will be owned 50-50 by the London and Frankfurt exchanges and will eventually use Xetra, Germany's advanced technology for carrying out transactions.</p>
        <p>Werner Seifert, the chief executive of Deutsche Borse, will be chief executive of the iX.</p>
        <p>''What belongs together finally comes together,'' he said. ''London is the largest cash market in Europe, and we bring in the largest derivatives market worldwide.''</p>
        <p>The management lineup reflects both the national sensitivities underlying the merger and the increasing weight of Frankfurt at the heart of the 11-nation euro-zone; Britain is not one of the 11.</p>
        <p>With the biggest of Europe's stock markets and a reputation as Europe's financial capital, London would once have automatically regarded itself as the senior partner in any European business combination. But Frankfurt's fast-growing and technologically advanced exchange earns more as a business than does the London Stock Exchange, bolstering its ambitions to displace London as Europe's financial hub.</p>
        <p>''Is this transaction a blow to the ambitions of finance center Germany? The answer is no,'' said Rolf Breuer, the chairman of the Deutsche Borse, who is also chief executive of Deutsche Bank. Indeed, some British bankers said the merger represented a German takeover because of the use of German technology and the appointment of Mr. Seifert as chief executive.</p>
        <p>One investment banker said it was noteworthy that high-growth and new companies would be listed in Frankfurt, in effect making it the new-economy center of Europe.</p>
        <p>The banker, who insisted on anonymity, added that the differing ownership structures of the London and Frankfurt exchanges meant that shareholdings in the merged company would be heavily weighted toward the big German banks that dominate the Deutsche Borse. Ownership of the London Stock Exchange is shared by over 290 members who voted earlier this year to make the exchange a publicly owned company, while ownership of the Deutsche Borse is much more restricted.</p>
        <p>Mr Seifert said the iX's long-term goal was to go public with an initial public offering.</p>
        <p>Others said the move was inevitable considering the changing profile of the marketplace.</p>
        <p>Michael Marks, executive chairman of Merrill Lynch Europe, Middle East and Africa, called the merger and tie-in with the Nasdaq exchange ''a significant step forward in the creation of a broader, deeper, more liquid marketplace.''</p>
        <p>''The investors have moved on, and they want one stock market to reflect that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Both the German and British governments welcomed the deal, and the European Union said the merger was unlikely to encounter regulatory hurdles.</p>
        <p>The participants made their announcement today with more emphasis on grand visions than on detail. It remains unclear, for instance, precisely when and at what cost Germany's Xetra technology will be rolled out for British investors, or what savings may benefit investors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seifert said conversion to Xetra should be possible some time in the first six months of 2001. London traders work on the SETS system and ''people are going to face conversion costs that have not been spelled out,'' one trader said.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the number of possible layoffs is unclear.</p>
        <p>Britain's position outside the euro-zone also means that London-listed blue chips, including giants like BP Amoco, will be quoted in both euros and pounds. Some bankers expressed concerns about the costs of clearing and settlement in the merged market.</p>
        <p>The Deutsche Borse owns 50 percent of the Luxembourg-based Clearstream settlement system, which is not included in the merger. Clearstream said today that it was in talks with CrestCo Ltd. of Britain. Both companies will provide settlement services to the merged exchange, but a Clearstream spokesman said a merger between them was ''quite a long way down the line.''</p>
        <p>Much of the impetus for the deal came from the rapid pace of events beyond the control of traditional exchanges, notably the proliferation of smaller and more nimble electronic trading systems like Tradepoint in Britain, which allow investors to bypass traditional brokers. Tradepoint, which is supported by big American and European banks, plans to start a pan-European trading system in July and says it will offer investors lower costs.</p>
        <p>The challenge presented by such organizations emerged anew today when Mr. Breuer, the Deutsche Bank chief executive, was asked whether his organization would withdraw from Tradepoint in favor of the iX. His answer was less than a ringing endorsement for the merged exchanges. ''Both systems have still to show whether they'll perform,'' he said. ''So let's wait and see.''</p>
