        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Imagine my surprise when I saw my alma mater, Mount St. Mary, on the front page of Circuits because of its wireless campus network. But the Dominican sisters have always been on the cutting edge.</p>
        <p>In the winter, we (the class of 1946) would ride sleighs down the hill in front of the main building pictured (where a student was using her laptop under a tree), and in the spring we would walk along a path bordered with lilac bushes. Such a flood of memories. You made my day.</p>
