        <p>President Clinton visited an elementary school here today to read ''Charlotte's Web'' with fourth graders and promote his latest plan to help states turn around failing schools.</p>
        <p>The school, Audubon Elementary, was Mr. Clinton's first stop on a two-day tour of public schools in Kentucky, Iowa, Minnesota and Ohio. The trip is meant to draw attention to his proposals to hold failing schools more accountable, increase school construction, open more charter schools and improve teacher quality.</p>
        <p>With only eight months left in the White House, Mr. Clinton is eager to emphasize what he thinks of as his legacy in education, one of his pet issues in his more than two decades of public service.</p>
        <p>He is also hoping to draw attention to Vice President Al Gore's education proposals while at least indirectly criticizing those of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the likely Republican presidential nominee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's battle against Mr. Bush is expected to be fierce in all four states that Mr. Clinton is visiting on this trip -- Mr. Bush recently ran an advertisement attacking the Clinton administration's education policies in Kentucky and Iowa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's school tour also comes at a time when his administration is wrangling with the Republicans in Congress over a major education law that Congress must reauthorize this year.</p>
        <p>The law, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, governs how more than $15 billion in annual federal aid to public schools is spent. The Republicans want the money to be distributed to the states in block grants and let them direct it toward any educational programs, including private school vouchers.</p>
        <p>But the administration would distribute the money in grants targeted to specific programs that it wants schools to embrace, like summer school programs and mentoring for teachers.</p>
        <p>''The answer to excellence for all our children is not to take money away from our schools through vouchers,'' Mr. Clinton said in a speech to several hundred students, parents and teachers, ''but to combine the money with high standards, accountability, and the tools teachers, children and parents need to succeed.''</p>
        <p>Many politicians have held up Kentucky as a model for education reform, because a landmark court ruling here in 1989 led to the most comprehensive overhaul of public education the nation had ever seen.</p>
        <p>A court order required the state to sharply increase aid to poor school districts, which used the additional money to reduce class size, improve curriculums, increase preschool programs and create a statewide testing system.</p>
        <p>Audubon Elementary School, with 450 students, most of them from families classified as poor, used to have some of the lowest test scores in the state. But it now ranks 18th in the state, with 70 percent of its students performing above average on reading tests.</p>
        <p>In his speech, Mr. Clinton saluted the school's turnaround and announced that he would send teams from the Department of Education into other states to make sure they are ''meeting their responsibilities on low-performing schools.'' He also announced that the Education Department would begin publishing annual reports listing the nation's lowest performing schools and the strategies being used to improve them.</p>
        <p>In a morning visit to a first-grade classroom, Mr. Clinton read aloud from a chapter of ''Charlotte's Web'' and then listened to students read from it. He stopped several times to quiz the children on some of the bigger words in the chapter, like ''exertion'' and ''bewilderment.'' He also asked if any of the 19 students had seen the movie version.</p>
