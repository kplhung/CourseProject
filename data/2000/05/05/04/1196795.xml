        <p>TheStreet.com in New York, which operates a financial and business news Web site, has named DeVito/ Verdi in New York to handle its account, executives involved in the selection said yesterday. Billings were estimated at $10 million to $15 million.</p>
        <p>The company parted ways with its previous agency, Kirshenbaum Bond &amp; Partners in New York, several months ago. The decision to hire DeVito/Verdi came after a review that began with 10 to 20 agencies, most of them in New York.</p>
