        <p>Paul Conover and I met Michael Farmer during basic training at Fort Dix, N.J., in the mid-1960's. Conover and I were friends from Montclair.

        <p>Paul Conover and I met Michael Farmer during basic training at Fort Dix, N.J., in the mid-1960's. Conover and I were friends from Montclair. Farmer was a kid from Atlantic City, a 17-year-old who mumbled so badly you could never be sure what he was saying. He was big and good-looking, but the first impression was that he wasn't too swift.</p>
        <p>One night Farmer came over to our barracks -- uninvited -- while Conover and I, who were a couple of years older and light years cooler, were sitting on the floor, spit-shining our combat boots. Very tentatively and very politely, Farmer asked if he could join us.</p>
        <p>I told him to get lost. Farmer must not have understood because he promptly sat down, took off his boots and, over the next few minutes, proved to my satisfaction that he was as dumb as he sounded.</p>
        <p>First he told us he had joined the Army. Conover grinned and rolled his eyes. Then Farmer said he was in love with a girl in Atlantic City and planned to marry her. I shook my head. This was not a person worth spending time with. As a draftee, all I wanted was for my hair to grow back and to be reunited with that gleaming symbol of freedom and the good life, my Thunderbird.</p>
        <p>But Conover liked Farmer and told him to come back the next night.</p>
        <p>''He mumbles,'' I said.</p>
        <p>But Conover said, ''Ah, he's all right.''</p>
        <p>So Farmer came back, night after night, to smoke cigarettes, listen to Motown music, mumble about his girlfriend and polish boots. To my chagrin, I started to like him, though I still needed a translator to understand him. For the longest time I thought his girlfriend's name was Merlin. It was Marilyn.</p>
        <p>Farmer and Conover became very close. Eventually both of them were sent to Vietnam. I got lucky and was sent to Korea, which was no walk in the park. But it wasn't Vietnam.</p>
        <p>The impact of the war on Conover and Farmer was strange. When Farmer came back, he seemed more sure of himself, more open and fun-loving, less insecure. He and Marilyn were married.</p>
        <p>Conover, the most happy-go-lucky guy I had ever known, was a wreck. He was nervous. Jumpy. Some nights he would drink like a fiend. The cheerful optimism that had once defined his personality was gone.</p>
        <p>He wouldn't really talk about Vietnam. All I ever heard him say was, ''Didn't know I could get so scared.''</p>
        <p>Then the unthinkable happened. Farmer, who had enlisted for four years and was still in the service, got orders to go back to Vietnam. We told him not to go. Call your congressman, we said. Fight this thing. But Farmer didn't know how.</p>
        <p>It's not hard to guess what happened. Farmer's second tour lasted only a few months. I was in the back of my father's upholstery shop one afternoon when Conover walked in.</p>
        <p>''Farmer didn't make it,'' he said. And then he started crying.</p>
        <p>A year passed. I got a job with a newspaper. Conover got married. Other buddies got killed in the war, which began to look like it might go on forever. My sister's boyfriend got shot.</p>
        <p>I didn't realize it, but Conover's struggle was winding down. He wouldn't make it, either. I never got the story straight. All I know is that he got his hands on a gun, and one night he waited in a car outside his house for his wife to come home. When she showed up he shot her dead. Then he killed himself.</p>
        <p>Sunday was the 25th anniversary of the end of the war, which I cannot think about without thinking of Farmer and Conover. Neither had a clue about the politics or the history or the egos that sucked them up like dust from a carpet and consigned them to their pointless fate. Vietnam was a fool's errand, and the young and the ignorant went to their doom by the tens of thousands.</p>
        <p>When David Brinkley, appalled by the carnage, asked Lyndon Johnson why he didn't just pull out of Vietnam, thus saving many lives, Johnson replied, ''I'm not going to be the first American president to lose a war.''</p>
        <p>A couple of years ago I visited the Vietnam Memorial in Washington. I found Farmer's name, and then, not thinking, looked for Conover's. Of course, it wasn't there. But his short life and that of his wife, whose name I don't know, were wasted by Vietnam just a surely as the lives of those 58,000 other Americans listed on that bitter wall.</p>
