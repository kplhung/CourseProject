        <p>HENDEL-Clara, on April 27, 2000 at age 88 in Ann Arbor, Michigan (formerly of Manhattan). She leaves a daughter (Linda) and a son (Stephen), as well as 2 grandchildren (Elizabeth and Michael). She also leaves a loving sister, Beatrice (Lieberman) of Miami Beach, FL. Clara was predeceased by her husband and partner in life, Professor Samuel Hendel, of the City University of New York and Trinity College, who died in 1984. Clara was born in East Hartford, CT., but moved to New York at an early age. She was a New Yorker to her very core, and lived on West End Avenue until 1997, when she moved to Michigan to live near her son and his wife, Margaret. She will be missed by many people for many reasons, but by none more than her son Stephen. Clara was buried on Sunday, April 30, at Montefiore Cemetery next to her husband. A memorial service will be held in New York City in the near future.</p>
