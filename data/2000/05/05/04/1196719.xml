        <p>A federal judge refused today to extradite a 36-year-old Colombian lawyer facing drug trafficking charges in his homeland, saying that the Colombian government could not close a ''great big hole'' in its evidence linking the man to the crime.</p>

        <p>A federal judge refused today to extradite a 36-year-old Colombian lawyer facing drug trafficking charges in his homeland, saying that the Colombian government could not close a ''great big hole'' in its evidence linking the man to the crime.</p>
        <p>The suspect, Victor Manuel Tafur-Dominguez, a graduate student at Pace University Law School in White Plains, who worked for an anti-drug program in Colombia, would have been the first Colombian national extradited from the United States on drug charges under a 1979 treaty his father helped write.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tafur-Dominguez's father, Donald Rodrigo Tafur, a former Colombian senator, was killed in March 1992 outside his home in Cali during a wave of violence linked to the extradition of Colombian drug suspects to the United States, a procedure the treaty also sanctioned.</p>
        <p>The charges in Colombia, where Mr. Tafur-Dominguez is accused of helping to finance a $120 million shipment of cocaine that was seized in December 1998, are still pending, and Mr. Tafur-Dominguez said he would fight them from here.</p>
        <p>Colombia has the right to resubmit its extradition request at any time with amplified evidence; officials there have been quoted in Colombian newspapers in recent weeks as saying that if Mr. Tafur-Dominguez was not extradited it could affect future extradition of Colombian nationals to the United States.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman at the Colombian Embassy in Washington said the government would not have an immediate comment.</p>
        <p>''It's very risky there right now,'' Mr. Tafur-Dominguez said of Colombia, after a two-hour hearing today in which his lawyer, Joseph A. Tate, and Justice Department lawyers representing Colombia argued over what both sides agreed was conflicting evidence linking Mr. Tafur-Dominguez to the charges.</p>
        <p>''I think it was a fair hearing that the judge has given us and I'm going to keep working on this until it is all over,'' Mr. Tafur-Dominguez said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tafur-Dominguez, who was arrested March 4 near Philadelphia while traveling with his family to a flower show, drew passionate support from classmates and professors at Pace University who doubted that the quiet student they knew could be involved in such a crime.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tafur-Dominguez had fought the drug trade as assistant director of a Colombian government program that encourages farmers to grow crops other than coca. He nearly died in a plane crash in the Andes in March 1999, on his way to a village to explain the program.</p>
        <p>He went to the United States to recuperate near his mother, who lives an hour's drive north of Philadelphia. He enrolled at Pace last August to study environmental law.</p>
        <p>Supporters said they believed that Mr. Tafur-Dominguez had been framed by drug traffickers, and a Justice Department lawyer said last month that 12 people connected to the case had been killed.</p>
        <p>To win its case for extradition, Colombia must prove that probable cause exists that Mr. Tafur-Dominguez knowingly committed a crime.</p>
        <p>But Magistrate Judge Charles B. Smith ruled today that Colombia had nothing in its extradition papers proving that Mr. Tafur-Dominguez was aware that his checks were used in the cocaine deal. ''I honestly don't think I can find probable cause here,'' he said. ''We've got this great big hole in the evidence.''</p>
        <p>The case centered on 13 checks Mr. Tafur-Dominguez had written to a currency trader to exchange 512 million pesos for $350,000, the sum of his mother's government pension from her husband's death. Mr. Tate and Mr. Tafur-Dominguez said it was a legitimate transaction to get a more favorable exchange rate than that offered by commercial banks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tafur-Dominguez put the $350,000 in a Swiss bank account for safekeeping and had a bank statement for the deposit. But the checks later turned up in the accounts of a dummy company that Colombian officials said was behind the seven-ton cocaine shipment, among the largest seized in that country.</p>
