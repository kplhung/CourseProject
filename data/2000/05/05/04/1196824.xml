        <p>Nearly 12 years after a jumbo jet blew up in the skies of Scotland, raining bodies and flaming debris on the village of Lockerbie, the trial of two Libyans accused of planting a bomb on the plane got under way here today.</p>
        <p>The trial is unusual in many ways: with 270 victims, it is the largest mass murder trial in British history, the first time a patch of overseas soil has been designated Scottish to allow such an event and the first Scottish murder trial to use judges instead of a jury.</p>
        <p>It is also the first time a trial in what is nominally Britain has attracted the wide attention usually associated with the American courts.</p>
        <p>''In many senses this trial is unique,'' said John P. Grant, who leads a team of law professors from the University of Glasgow studying the trial and helping journalists understand Scottish law. ''It may become the longest trial in British history. It certainly will be the most expensive.''</p>
        <p>The trial, at a former NATO air base, culminates years of struggle among nations, outrage at the crime  and an investigation spanning the globe. The United Nations isolated Libya with sanctions that that country has claimed cost it $33 billion.  Years of diplomatic maneuvering ultimately allowed the suspects to be brought to trial, while Libya's dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, could still claim that he never handed them over to Libya's enemies.</p>
        <p>For all the ballyhoo, the trial got under way quite simply today.</p>
        <p>Under Scottish law, neither prosecution nor defense makes an opening statement. So after some preliminary motions had been agreed on, the indictment had been read and the defense had notified the prosecution of part of its plans, Judge Ranald Iain Sutherland looked up and said,  ''My Lord Advocate?'' The lead prosecutor, Colin Boyd, began, ''M'Lord, the first witness for the Crown is No. 1 on the witness list, Richard James Dawson.''</p>
        <p>After some sound system screeching was fixed -- by a court directive  that witnesses testify while seated, which somehow hushed the microphone feedback -- Mr. Dawson, a 52-year-old air traffic controller, began describing the air routes around Heathrow Airport near London from which Pan Am Flight 103 took off shortly before it blew up at about 7:03 p.m. on Dec. 21, 1988.</p>
        <p>The prosecution has a list of more than 1,000 witnesses, and the trial of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah is expected to last a year or more.</p>
        <p>The indictment lays out a lengthy description of the plot they are accused of. Both are said to have been members of the Libyan Intelligence Services -- Mr. Megrahi the head of security for Libyan Arab Airlines and Mr. Fhimah the airline's station manager in Malta -- and to have acted in their intelligence roles.</p>
        <p>The plot as described stretched from a special forces base in Libya where bomb timers were said to have been tested; to the offices of front companies, Mebo in Switzerland, and Medtours in what was then Czechoslovakia; to a Holiday Inn in Malta; and to Libyan government offices in Czechoslovakia and Germany.</p>
        <p>It involved purchases of electronic detonators, travel under false passports and the carrying out of an unexplained intelligence operation in Chad, but the core of it is this:</p>
        <p>The two men are accused of stealing airline luggage tags at Luqa Airport in Malta in December 1988, then using them to bring to Malta a suitcase and a Toshiba ''Bombeat'' portable stereo packed with plastic explosive and a timer. They bought clothing and an umbrella in Malta, the prosecution contends, packed them around the bomb, put them in the suitcase and checked it aboard Air Malta KM180 tagged so that it would go through Frankfurt, London and on to New York on Pan Am 103.</p>
        <p>Pan Am 103 blew up just after crossing the Solway Firth in Scotland at 31,000 feet.</p>
        <p>The list of the dead, part of the indictment, reads like headstones of a cemetery. It is alphabetical, so the name of Brittany Leigh Williams, 2 months old, of the 516th Engineer Company Army Post Office, New York, is found between those of her parents, Bonnie Leigh and Eric Jon, of the same address. All in all, 259 crew and passenger members and 11 residents of Lockerbie, two of them  10-year-olds, are on it.</p>
        <p>Although it began blandly, today's  testimony had a dramatic moment in midafternoon when Alan John Topp, the last controller to talk to the pilot, described losing contact with the flight. Its number disappeared from his radar screen he was monitoring, he said, as court television screens showed a tape of the screen he had been looking at.</p>
        <p>''We've lost the height readout,'' he testified, explaining the tape as if he were back at his desk that night. ''That could be a glitch. Now we've lost everything.</p>
        <p>''That one big bright square response,'' he continued, referring to a radar signal, ''is actually several big lights close together. That would be -- well, I don't want to say.''</p>
        <p>After a court break, he returned to describe how he kept trying to radio the plane -- seven attempts in the next eight minutes, two calls to a nearby KLM flight asking its crew to contact the Pan Am plane, a call to a controller in charge of a lower altitude and one in charge of over-ocean flights, trying to find out if they could see Pan Am 103 or had its pilot and co-pilot on their frequencies.</p>
        <p>At about 7:11, he said, he tried to wave his supervisor over. ''I said, 'I've got a problem,' '' he recounted.</p>
        <p>His boss, he said, replied: ''Not now. I'm trying to get through to the Dumfries and Galloway police.''</p>
        <p>''I said, 'What about?' '' Mr. Topp went on. ''He said, 'The big fire on the ground.' '' He didn't say explosion, but it was in my area -- it was at that point the penny dropped, sir.''</p>
        <p>''And what,'' the prosecutor asked, ''was the penny?''</p>
        <p>''I said, 'It's the Clipper 103.' ''</p>
        <p>Less dramatic, but possibly more important, was a 14-line document read out before testimony began.</p>
        <p>It was the defense's notice to the prosecution that it planned to blame the crime on a Syrian-backed Palestinian group.</p>
        <p>Under Scottish law, the defense must state at the opening of a trial if it plans to mount certain defenses. They include insanity, self-defense, coercion and ''incrimination'' -- a claim that someone else did it.</p>
        <p>McCourts, the firm defending Mr. Megrahi, filed notice that it would offer an incrimination defense that would blame members of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, possibly including two of the prosecution's witnesses and six other men, ''all present whereabouts unknown.'' The defense said they were ''all formerly directors of the Miska Bakery, Malta'' and members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine's General Command.</p>
        <p>Before the indictment naming the Libyans was announced in 1991, much attention had focused on Iranians, Syrians and Palestinians as suspects, and one theory had been that the Pan Am bombing was revenge not for the American bombing raid on Tripoli in 1986 that killed one of Mr. Qaddafi's children, but for the shooting down of an Iranian airliner by the American warship Vincennes in 1988.</p>
        <p>According to those theories, the Iranians were said to have ''subcontracted'' their revenge, like a Mafia hit, to Syrians and Palestinians.</p>
        <p>The defense asked few questions today, but focused on how long the plane was at 31,000 feet before it exploded, how far the debris blew and whether the plane was definitely in Scottish airspace, not English.</p>
        <p>Scottish law contains other provisions foreign to Americans. Normally, serious crimes are tried before 15 jurors, and only eight votes are needed to convict.</p>
        <p>In this case, the defense had argued that it could not get a fair trial with a jury because of advance publicity and anti-Libyan feeling. The prosecution agreed that it would be unfair to have Scottish jurors away from home for perhaps 18 months.</p>
        <p>As a result, three judges are hearing the case; a fourth sits on the bench in case one becomes ill. Two of three are needed to convict.</p>
        <p>Three verdicts are possible: guilty, not guilty or not proven.</p>
        <p>A not proven verdict ''leaves a question mark over the head of the accused, but it's an acquittal,'' said Jim Murdoch, a former defense lawyer who now teaches at the University of Glasgow law school. ''As they're leaving the court, a cloud is over their head, but they are leaving the court.''</p>
        <p>A case found ''not proven'' cannot be tried again on the same charge.</p>
        <p>More than 200 Scottish police officers, some with submachine guns, are guarding the prison compound, which has a 20-foot-high concrete wall. The trial is expected to cost up to $200 million, including construction costs at this former NATO base.</p>
        <p>On the outside, the courthouse looks like the gymnasium of a prosperous suburban high school. Inside, the judges, each seated before his own monitor that displays evidence,  provide nearly the only color in the court: the snow-white chests of their robes are dotted with square red crosses, and they sit beneath the mace symbolizing the court's authority and the Royal Arms of Scotland, flanked by a lion and unicorn.</p>
        <p>Six wall-mounted video cameras sweep the court; the signal is beamed into a media center nearby that held about 200 reporters today. It also goes to New York, London and Dumfries, where families of the victims are allowed to follow the trial. The trial is not otherwise broadcast; Scottish courts forbid it.</p>
        <p>Photographers are not allowed in the courtroom, nor are they to take shots of the video monitors.</p>
        <p>Journalists are not supposed to talk to victims' families in the sealed-off court gallery, but many family members, who have filed their own civil lawsuits, want to talk, and the police have not intervened.</p>
        <p>Scottish court officials often refer unfavorably to the O. J. Simpson trial, and reporters have been told to assume that neither prosecutors nor defense lawyers will speak to them.</p>
        <p>''And Scottish judges don't do press conferences,'' warned a court press aide. ''So don't ask.''</p>
