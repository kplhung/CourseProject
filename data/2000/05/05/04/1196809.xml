        <p>Re ''Beyond the Organizer: Handhelds Add Power and Peripherals,'' State of the Art, April 27): The combination of Psion hardware and EPOC software does everything that Palm and the Pocket PC claim to do, and even what they say they will do in the future.

        <p>The difference is that Psion and EPOC actually do it. They have done it since late 1999 with actual devices that are out there, not vaporware. And they have a majority market share in the European Union, which has a larger population than the United States. Its cumulative real-user United States market share is comparable to CE's. And with its Symbian alliance (and now Sony) its hype-able future is as bright as anybody's.</p>
