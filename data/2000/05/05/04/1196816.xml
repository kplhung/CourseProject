        <p>I am an 11-year-old girl, and I know what girls think about. The new President Barbie doll (Op-Ed, May 1) teaches girls that even if you aren't a boy, you can be president. Barbie's been around for so long that girls look up to her, and now they have an even better reason to, since she's president.</p>

        <p>My 5-year-old sister, Charlotte, said she knows that being president means being ''boss.'' President Barbie shows girls that they can be the boss just as boys can.</p>
        <p>We're on our way to a revolution of girls' power, and President Barbie is going to help us get there.</p>
