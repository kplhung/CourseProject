        <p>With the first major expansion of the city's transit system since the 1930's set to go forward, this is a promising moment for public transportation in New York. The scheduled projects are a Second Avenue subway on Manhattan's Upper East Side, a Long Island Rail Road link to Grand Central Terminal and extension of a rail line to La Guardia Airport. To build these links, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is embarking on a $17 billion capital program that has been criticized as financially unsound and unduly influenced by Bear Stearns &amp; Company as a financial adviser. The capital plan is important to the region and deserves to go forward. But Gov. George Pataki, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and legislative leaders must take steps to ensure that it does not force undue fare increases in the future, and the M.T.A. should recruit an independent adviser to review the financing scheme and the role of Bear Stearns.</p>
        <p>Thanks to a booming economy, transit improvements and a new fare structure, commuter and transit riders have increased 40 percent in five years. The M.T.A. has made two sound choices in pushing initially for the L.I.R.R. connection to Grand Central and for the Second Avenue subway from 125th Street to 63rd Street. This page continues to be skeptical about the priority given to the La Guardia link. The M.T.A. may find that extending the No. 7 line from Times Square to Pennsylvania Station and the far West Side makes more sense.</p>

        <p>With the first major expansion of the city's transit system since the 1930's set to go forward, this is a promising moment for public transportation in New York. The scheduled projects are a Second Avenue subway on Manhattan's Upper East Side, a Long Island Rail Road link to Grand Central Terminal and extension of a rail line to La Guardia Airport. To build these links, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is embarking on a $17 billion capital program that has been criticized as financially unsound and unduly influenced by Bear Stearns &amp; Company as a financial adviser. The capital plan is important to the region and deserves to go forward. But Gov. George Pataki, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and legislative leaders must take steps to ensure that it does not force undue fare increases in the future, and the M.T.A. should recruit an independent adviser to review the financing scheme and the role of Bear Stearns.</p>
        <p>Thanks to a booming economy, transit improvements and a new fare structure, commuter and transit riders have increased 40 percent in five years. The M.T.A. has made two sound choices in pushing initially for the L.I.R.R. connection to Grand Central and for the Second Avenue subway from 125th Street to 63rd Street. This page continues to be skeptical about the priority given to the La Guardia link. The M.T.A. may find that extending the No. 7 line from Times Square to Pennsylvania Station and the far West Side makes more sense.</p>
        <p>But, as reported in The Times earlier this week, concerns have been raised about the M.T.A.'s financing plan because it was recommended by Bear Stearns, a financial firm that stands to make tens of millions of dollars if the plan goes through. The M.T.A. has reinforced the suspicions by the secretive way it has put the financing together. Before proceeding, the agency should hire a new financial adviser, using competitive bidding, to undertake a thorough review. Any underwriting business should also be awarded by competitive bid, rather than going automatically to Bear Stearns.</p>
        <p>Criticisms of the financing center on the fact that it includes both the refinancing of old bonds and issuing of new bonds, which together would push debt service costs to 24 percent of the operating budget in 10 years, compared with 15 percent today. The resulting squeeze could curtail future improvements and force fare increases if alternative sources of financing are not found. The M.T.A. argues, however, that long-term debt repayments for major projects make sense because the new lines will be in use for decades.</p>
        <p>The M.T.A. is taking a calculated risk that by putting forward an ambitious and much needed plan it will generate sufficient pressure on city and state elected leaders to ensure its financing. It was a good sign that recently the Legislature and Mr. Pataki agreed to plug a $2.4 billion hole in the M.T.A.'s budget over the next five years with $850 million in new funds. They also authorized a $3.8 billion bond issue on the ballot in November, with 40 percent of it earmarked for the M.T.A.</p>
        <p>But more financing will be needed from other sources. With its own big surpluses, New York City may be able to increase its support of the transit system. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, where the directors from the two states are in an unseemly fight over allocations, could also be a source of financing for the city's mass transit needs. Most important of all, the federal government is a possible source of increased financing for mass transit.</p>
        <p>A healthy transit system is essential to the economic, environmental and physical well-being of the New York region, justifying considerable subsidies from taxpayers to supplement fare revenues.  The M.T.A. is right to proceed with its plan and enlist government leaders on all levels to battle for full financing.</p>
