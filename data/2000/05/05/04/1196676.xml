        <p>The Library of Congress is marking its bicentennial in part by honoring Thomas Jefferson.

        <p>As one of its Jefferson projects, the Library has posted online images of all its Jefferson papers, about 83,000 items, at memory.loc.gov/ammem/mtjhtml/mtjhome.html.</p>
        <p>A spokesman said the library had the largest and most comprehensive collection of Jefferson's papers. They are divided into nine groups, including financial statements and drafts of the Declaration of Independence.</p>
        <p>The legibility of the aging, handwritten documents ''varies substantially,'' the library notes.</p>
        <p>The images can be downloaded, and some have modern text transcriptions.</p>
