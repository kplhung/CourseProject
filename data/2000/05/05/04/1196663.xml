        <p>The Oxalis Tribe</p>
        <p>Q.: We recently purchased two small potted oxalis plants. I know that there are varieties too numerous to mention, but in general, what are the recommended care, indoor and outdoor; soil content; temperature; drainage preference; watering; and sun requirements? Do they winter over? If so, how does one treat them?</p>
        <p>A.: You're right about the size of the oxalis tribe. Unfortunately, a genus with species too numerous to mention is also one about which it is difficult to generalize. Though all Oxalis are more or less rounded plants with cloverlike leaves and have delicate, five petal flowers, that's about it for family resemblance.</p>

        <p>The Oxalis Tribe</p>
        <p>Q.: We recently purchased two small potted oxalis plants. I know that there are varieties too numerous to mention, but in general, what are the recommended care, indoor and outdoor; soil content; temperature; drainage preference; watering; and sun requirements? Do they winter over? If so, how does one treat them?</p>
        <p>A.: You're right about the size of the oxalis tribe. Unfortunately, a genus with species too numerous to mention is also one about which it is difficult to generalize. Though all Oxalis are more or less rounded plants with cloverlike leaves and have delicate, five petal flowers, that's about it for family resemblance.</p>
        <p>Pink-flowered O. acetosella, for instance, is a rhizome-forming woodland dweller that spreads readily into wide mats. It blooms in spring, stays green all summer and comes through Canadian winters unscathed.</p>
        <p>O. lobata, on the other hand, is a bright light lover that can't stand frost. A tuberous-rooted native of Chile, it makes leaves in spring, goes dormant for summer and then puts out new leaves and brilliant yellow flowers in the fall.</p>
        <p>Most of the showiest oxalis have a dormant period, but since your plants came label-free, they're probably from a species that doesn't mind skipping this step. If they have bands of purple at the top of grass green leaves, they could be Iron Cross, usually classed as O. tetraphylla. If they have large purple leaves and bright pink flowers, suspect O. regnellii.</p>
        <p>Both are perennials that should be treated as houseplants north of the Carolinas. They do well in bright light, but not hot sun, and can take some shade. A loose soil that drains well is best, since they like a lot of water but not soggy feet. Add some perlite if you have them in regular potting soil. Though they droop if they dry out, they have amazing powers of recovery once watered.</p>
        <p>Feed monthly with a bloom-encouraging fertilizer as long as they're flowering, then let them rest. Avoid high-nitrogen plant food, which will encourage leaves at the expense of flowers and encourage rot at the expense of the plants.</p>
        <p>Almost Arugula</p>
        <p>Q.: At a fund-raiser, I bought a small plant that was labeled perennial arugula. Now that it's about six inches wide, I'm afraid it's something else. The leaves are smaller, shinier and darker green than arugula from the store. They are also much narrower than regular arugula. Is it really the same plant?</p>
        <p>A.: It isn't the same plant (it isn't even the same genus), but it is very similar in flavor and is often called wild arugula or arugula selvatica.</p>
        <p>Your new friend is Diplotaxis tenuifolia, also known as D. erucoides. True arugula is Eruca vesicaria subsp. sativa, and although it's the bigger mouthful to say, it's the smaller one to eat. Selvatica is almost hot, decidedly more pungent than garden arugula, though it is also sweeter. To many palates, it also has a cleaner, less old-radishy taste, and it holds up better when cooked.</p>
        <p>The two arugulas have similar growing habits. They thrive in the cool of spring, then as the weather warms they become stronger flavored and shoot up flowers that are also edible. At that point, they part company. True arugula flowers are white with a hint of lavender, and once they show up, that's pretty much it for the leaves. Selvatica flowers are yellow, and you can enjoy them, then cut the plants back and get another crop in the fall.</p>
        <p>Like garden arugula, the wild kind will self-sow. Let it go to seed this summer and you'll have babies by late autumn. But if you turn out to like it at all, one plant won't go far. Better plant more right away.</p>
        <p>Seed is available from Cook's Garden, P.O. Box 535, Londonderry, Vt. 05148, (800) 457-9703, and Pinetree Garden Seeds, P.O. Box 300, New Gloucester, Me. 04260, (207) 926-3400.</p>
        <p>Address questions to Garden Q.&amp; A., The New York Times, 229 West 43rd Street, New York 10036, or by e-mail to gardening@nytimes .com. Those of general interest will be published. Unpublished questions cannot be answered individually.</p>
