        <p>After the games in Germany, the United States team will travel to Norway for two matches. The game on July 27 will be played in Tromso, which is 115 miles north of the Artic Circle, and is scheduled to begin at 10:30 p.m. local time. Lights, however, will not be needed because there are nearly 24 hours of daylight at that time of the year. The final match of the trip will be played on July 30 in Oslo.</p>
