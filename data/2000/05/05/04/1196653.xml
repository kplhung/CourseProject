        <p>MY first journal, which I kept when I was in third grade, was white with colored hearts and a tiny brass lock. For several weeks I wrote about what I did each day and declared love or disdain for various family members and friends. For a while I even wrote about each of my stuffed animals and their imaginary adventures.</p>
        <p>But before long I began to skip days, and my entries became shorter. Less than a month after starting, my highlights consisted of ''Today was a normal day'' or ''Nothing happened today.'' My journal writing burnout lasted until high school, when I began writing again, this time recording my moments of anxiety and great insight in a pastel blue Laura Ashley journal.</p>

        <p>MY first journal, which I kept when I was in third grade, was white with colored hearts and a tiny brass lock. For several weeks I wrote about what I did each day and declared love or disdain for various family members and friends. For a while I even wrote about each of my stuffed animals and their imaginary adventures.</p>
        <p>But before long I began to skip days, and my entries became shorter. Less than a month after starting, my highlights consisted of ''Today was a normal day'' or ''Nothing happened today.'' My journal writing burnout lasted until high school, when I began writing again, this time recording my moments of anxiety and great insight in a pastel blue Laura Ashley journal.</p>
        <p>The fabric-covered journals I remember are still available, but children now have software options that perform the same function: helping them to express their thoughts, emotions, joys and fears in private.</p>
        <p>YOUR NOTEBOOK (WITH HELP FROM AMELIA)  This is an outlet for creative young journal writers. Amelia, a fictional 10-year-old created by Marissa Moss, is imaginative and shows an appreciation for sarcasm without the usual teenage bitterness. You enter her room, where the walls, posters, windows and books are all interactive. Clicking on the poster of a rocket, for example, causes the rocket to take off and a parachutist to pass the window. But beyond a fun start, the bedroom has little to do with the journal.</p>
        <p>The journal writer can choose among fonts, colors, pictures and designs, either on a blank page or on pages with titles like ''Friends Forever'' or ''Things I Hate.'' Images can be imported from other programs or from a huge library.</p>
        <p>I created a page using the ''Gross Food'' heading, where I described the horrors of eating eggplant. Then I used the drawing tools to draw a picture of the dreadful vegetable. With a microphone, I could have recorded my voice saying ''yuck,'' to be sounded whenever the mouse ran over my drawing.</p>
        <p>I started another page with a blank layout and imported a scanned photograph and some happy music.  There are many creative corners to explore, and a user with writer's block can click on a light bulb icon for suggestions.</p>
        <p>On the downside, the program ran slowly when creating new pages and journals and when importing images. The print screen provides suggestions about binding a printed journal up to 50 pages long.</p>
        <p>DIARY MAKER  This program, from Scholastic, approaches journal writing as an art. The journal portion  seemed primitive compared with the other programs, but its educational program includes excerpts from the journals of Anne Frank; Latoya Hunter, a immigrant teenager who grew up in the Bronx; and Zlata Filipovic, a young girl who wrote about her struggle to survive in Sarajevo during the Bosian war. Users can hear pages of the diaries read in English and explore other information about these journal keepers. All three provide the inspiration and motivation to practice the art of journal writing.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, Diary Maker's writing component does not measure up. It is simple and feels ready for an upgrade. Users can add backgrounds, sounds and images to their journals, but there are no drawing tools and the library of stamps and sounds is limited. The program provides remarkable inspiration for  writing, but its tools will feel restrictive to today's computer-using writers.</p>
        <p>DARIA'S SICK, SAD LIFE PLANNER  This software, for older children and young adults, takes a cynical approach. It includes a calendar, a planner, a journal and other electronic toys. The program is similar to any organizer product but it has sardonic, angst-ridden comments from Daria, the MTV cartoon teenager, interjected throughout. The tools are accessible and useful, but I found the extras, like Daria screen savers and icons, disappointing.</p>
        <p>I am a Daria fan, and as I typed daily musings into the journal, I found my own inner Daria scowling through. It becomes nearly impossible to write anything overly enthusiastic or optimistic in this journal.</p>
        <p>The program includes an address book, but when you add a buddy, the somber Daria comments, ''Great, another person who pretends they like you.'' For a teenager predisposed to thinking this way, the Daria journal offers encouragement -- maybe too much.</p>
