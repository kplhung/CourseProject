        <p>Following is a transcript of opening remarks by Joseph Zwilling, the spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York, at a news conference to announce the death of Cardinal John O'Connor last night, as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>His Eminence John Cardinal O'Connor has completed his earthly journey and has gone home to God. The cardinal died May 3, 2000, at 8:05 p.m. in his residence on Madison Avenue. The cardinal died very peacefully, with his sister Mary Ward and other family members, clergy and co-workers at his side.</p>
        <p>The cardinal's health took a sudden and dramatic turn for the worse early in the morning of May 3. He was kept comfortable and did not experience any pain. The cardinal received the sacrament of the sick last Saturday and on several other occasions during his illness.</p>
        <p>Cardinal O'Connor had been experiencing a growing weakness over the past month and a half. This weakness caused the cardinal to limit his public activities and appearances in early March and to cease other official archdiocesan activities in late March.</p>
        <p>One of the cardinal's most passionate beliefs was that by uniting our suffering with the suffering of Christ on the cross, we can be instruments of enormous good in the world.</p>
        <p>As the cardinal often said, Christ did not make possible the salvation of the world through his teaching, his preaching, his miracles, but by his suffering and death on the cross. When he appeared to be utterly powerless, he was radiating the greatest power ever unleashed in the world.</p>
        <p>The cardinal united his own illness and suffering of these past eight months with the suffering of Christ and always accepted the changes in his condition with great faith in God and in his mercy and gentle goodness.</p>
        <p>In all things, the cardinal followed the advice given to him on the day he became a bishop by Mother Teresa: give God permission. May the Lord grant eternal peace to the soul of our loving and faithful archbishop, John Cardinal O'Connor.</p>
