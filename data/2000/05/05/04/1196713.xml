        <p>As President Bill Clinton prepares to decide whether to deploy a ballistic missile defense system or to wait for further testing to be completed, it may be useful to recall the history that has brought us to this point.</p>
        <p>When President Reagan came to office almost 20 years ago, the Soviet Union had a huge advantage -- 3 to 1  -- in highly accurate ballistic missiles that had developed over the previous 10 years. Our ability to deter a first-strike attack with an adequate force of survivable counterstrike weapons -- the concept of mutual assured destruction -- had become tenuous in the minds of sensible American leaders, both Republican and Democrat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan had considered but was unimpressed by the theory of mutual assured destruction. He believed strongly that keeping the peace through a threat to annihilate humankind was immoral, and he came to office with the hope of starting work on a defensive system. His vision was morally inspired and deeply felt.</p>
        <p>Despite his passion for a defensive system, however, nothing was done for two years. It was reported that neither the uniformed military nor Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger initially believed Mr. Reagan's goals to be achievable.</p>
        <p>In 1981 and 1982, we had tried and failed to maintain the viability of offense-based deterrence. Congress had rejected deployment of the MX missile, and it became clear that we had to find a new way to deal with a growing Soviet superiority in first-strike systems. If we couldn't do it offensively, with the MX, then our only alternative was to explore relying on defense.</p>
        <p>That led me, as deputy national security adviser, to ask several leading scientists whether technology had advanced far enough to warrant another look at a defensive system. The answers from men I respected, like Dr. John Foster at TRW, were encouraging. I then took the idea to Adm. James Watkins, the chief of naval operations, since any such concept would need the support of the military to pass muster with Congress.</p>
        <p>Admiral Watkins, a cerebral and devoutly religious man, identified with President Reagan's moral motive and was very supportive. The other chiefs of staff fell into line,  seeing the president's strong devotion to the concept and the scale of potential funding involved.</p>
        <p>In the ensuing years, neither the president nor the team of scientists who focused on strategic defense nor I believed it would be achievable during his term. But all of us came to believe that we needed to begin exploring defense to deal with the current, as well as foreseeable, threats.</p>
        <p>I also believed that by investing in America's comparative advantage in high technology, we would be competing more sensibly than we had for the previous 40 years. Conceivably, the burden that competing with the Strategic Defense Initiative would impose on the Soviet economy -- when combined with the expense of modernizing the country's conventional forces -- might lead the Soviets to reduce their offensive systems, ultimately eliminating the need to deploy large-scale, space-based S.D.I.</p>
        <p>It was in that context, in December 1984, that I stated in a background session with journalists that because we wouldn't be able to deploy the system in Mr. Reagan's term, it might be called ''the greatest sting in history.'' But it wasn't a ruse at all. And my statement in no way suggested any lack of support for the program. Indeed it was my responsibility to make it succeed.</p>
        <p>Obviously, that the Strategic Defense Initiative might lead the Soviets to make concessions was a hope without guarantee. But trying it was worth the risk, because we would begun research and development on a system that someday we would need for a different, but foreseeable threat.</p>
        <p>That day has come. The threat is substantially different and not as large, but North Korea and soon two or three other rogue states will present a serious nuclear threat.</p>
        <p>Seventeen years of research has allowed us to cover a lot of ground on missile defense. Still more work is needed before a decision on deployment is made. Research on both the Navy's Aegis sea-based system and its land-based counterpart should be pursued more aggressively than current financing allows.</p>
        <p>A delay will also provide useful time in which a new government in Washington can engage with the new Russian government and reach a mutually beneficial basis for modifying the outdated ABM treaty. My recommendation would be to share our technology with them so that they could use it too -- as President Reagan intended to do. Once testing and the bilateral negotiations are completed successfully, a decision can be made.</p>
        <p>At that point Congress should finance deployment of a robust missile-defense system. Thanks to President Reagan's vision and determination, the means of our defense are within reach.</p>
