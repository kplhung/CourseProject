        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton will begin her television advertising campaign tonight, with a 30-second ad called ''First.'' The campaign is spending $400,000 to buy time for the ad, with two-thirds of the money going upstate. The allocation is the latest sign of the emphasis the Clinton campaign is placing on upstate New York.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Devito/Verdi, with Mandy Grunwald, the Washington media consultant, and Mark Penn, the Washington pollster.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- A series of sepia-toned images of Mrs. Clinton: first, as a young lawyer, followed by a succession of shots of her with children, speaking at a lectern, reading to school children, and then with her hand waving in the air. A succession of phrases flickers across the screen: ''First she became a lawyer. Her first cause was children. Her first priority was public schools. More than a first lady.''</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Rather than being read by an urgent-voiced professional announcer, the script is delivered by a copywriter at the Devito/Verdi agency, with a soft tone to his voice: ''First she became a lawyer, named one of the top hundred in America. Her first cause was children, fighting abuse, and chairing the board of the Children's Defense Fund. Her first priority was public schools, helping to establish teacher testing. More than a first lady. For 30 years, she has fought for children and family. As New York's senator, she'll fight for better schools and health care for children. Hillary. Put her to work for all of us.''</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- In one sense, the advertisement is a fairly typical first ad of a campaign: soft, biographical, hinting at some of the themes of Mrs. Clinton's campaign, in particular education and children. But there are a number of notable aspects. For one thing, one fairly obvious word -- ''Clinton'' -- is absent, save for the tag line identifying the  committee paying for the ad. The candidate is only ''Hillary,'' a deliberate effort to counter the concern among women that she is simply a product of her husband. Strategically, it is the latest effort by Mrs. Clinton's advisers to fill in what they contend are the missing parts of her political biography: her time before her years in the White House.</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- These are the kinds of generic claims that do not lend themselves to any dispute, though aides to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani were quick to criticize the ad. ''This is the latest attempt to reinvent Mrs. Clinton, but it's not real and it won't work, because New Yorkers appreciate authenticity and the fact is that Mrs. Clinton doesn't have a record, except for a failed attempt to socialize health care,'' said Bruce J. Teitelbaum, the Giuliani campaign manager.</p>
        <p>The ad for Mrs. Clinton is available at The New York Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com/politics.</p>
