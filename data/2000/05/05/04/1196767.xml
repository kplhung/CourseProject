        <p>The remark would normally provoke little notice. But coming from Werner G. Seifert, chief executive of Germany's stock exchange, it was startling.</p>
        <p>''There's no reason why we have to be headquartered in Frankfurt,'' Mr. Seifert remarked at a dinner late in January. ''I could imagine myself living in London. Why not?''</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Seifert announced that he would indeed be moving to London. In a stunning development, Deutsche Borse, the parent company of the Frankfurt stock market, confirmed that it would merge with the London Stock Exchange and that Mr. Seifert would be chief executive of the new company.</p>
        <p>It is the most advanced step yet taken toward creating a pan-European securities market, uniting the Continent's two biggest exchanges into a single corporation that will be nearly twice as big as the next contender -- the recently announced merger of the Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels markets. In also announcing an alliance with Nasdaq, the new exchange could become the European anchor for a global trading system available 24 hours a day.</p>
        <p>But the most remarkable aspect of the deal may be the extent to which Mr. Seifert and the Frankfurt exchange -- until recently, a secondary market -- are calling the shots. London is now nearly twice as large as Frankfurt in terms of stock trading, and the financial district, the City of London, is by far Europe's biggest center for investment banking and trading.</p>
        <p>The idea that a Frankfurt executive might suddenly be in charge would until very recently have seemed absurd. Frankfurt is a city of bankers more than traders, a quiet place compared with London and its thousands of brokers, traders, nalysts, deal makers, information merchants and back-office workers.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Seifert, who came to Frankfurt from Switzerland, has turned the old order upside down. Not only will he be chief executive of the new exchange -- to be called iX (short for international exchanges and pronounced eye-ex) -- but London will give up its own electronic trading system in favor of Frankfurt's Xetra system.</p>
        <p>Much of this new force stems from Mr. Seifert, an iconoclastic management consultant, who by avocation is a passionate jazz musician and an aficionado of fine food. More than any of his counterparts in London or Paris, according to executives at big financial institutions, Mr. Seifert redefined the basic mission of an exchange and then charged ahead.</p>
        <p>''The main difference that has given Deutsche Borse its power has been the strength of its management,'' a senior executive at a large financial institution said. ''The other exchange executives have been slow to make changes, wedded to doing things by consensus and avoiding conflicts. Seifert has had a clear idea of what he wanted, and he went after it.''</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Mr. Seifert merged Frankfurt's market for futures and options with that of its Swiss competitor to form Eurex. Last year, Eurex became the world's biggest derivatives market, eclipsing not only the London International Financial Futures Exchange but also the Chicago Board of Trade.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seifert also oversaw the opening of Frankfurt's Neuer Markt, a three-year-old exchange for younger technology companies like some of those traded on Nasdaq. Until then, new companies had little chance of going public in Germany or in most other European countries.</p>
        <p>Today, many European exchanges have their own ''new markets.'' But none has grown as explosively as Frankfurt's, which now handles 80 percent of such trading in Europe.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most important, Mr. Seifert built up Xetra, the Deutsche Borse's electronic trading system. Besides running Germany's exchanges, Xetra underpins Vienna's stock exchange and is being adapted for exchanges in Helsinki and Dublin. The Chicago Board of Trade is planning a collaborative electronic platform with Deutsche Borse that will be based on Xetra as well.</p>
        <p>''Our business isn't really trading in stocks or bonds,'' Mr. Seifert, 50, said recently. ''Our fundamental business is building systems, loading systems and operating systems.''</p>
        <p>Thanks in large part to its stake in Eurex, Deutsche Brse earned 124 million euros (now $111 million) last year on revenue of 643 million euros ($576 million). London had significantly lower figures: revenue of $233 million and profit of $41.8 million.</p>
        <p>People who have been close to the negotiations say that Mr. Seifert's ambitions have sometimes angered rivals. When talks with the London officials became known several weeks ago, Mr. Seifert was demanding that the shareholders in Deutsche Borse -- which are mainly Germany's big banks -- get 60 percent of the merged company.</p>
        <p>The specter of an outright takeover angered many on the London exchange and Mr. Seifert back-pedaled. About a week ago, the two sides agreed to a 50-50 merger by keeping Frankfurt's clearing and settlement business out of the merger.</p>
        <p>But all exchanges have been facing a common reality: a growing unwillingness among big financial institutions to tolerate the high costs that arise from trading over fragmented national exchanges.</p>
        <p>The exchanges have negotiated over alliances for years, but their talks broke down amid disputes over control and over which system would be scrapped and which would be used as the common trading platform.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seifert was among the first to become impatient with the meandering negotiations. With backing from Deutsche Bank, the biggest shareholder in his market, he shocked other Europeans by negotiating a limited two-party alliance with the London market two years ago.</p>
        <p>News of that alliance outraged many of Mr. Seifert's counterparts, particularly in Paris. Yet in the months that followed, many of the other exchanges announced their intentions to grudgingly join up with the German-British plan.</p>
        <p>But those talks floundered as well, with the various national markets unable to agree on a common technology, much less on a merger. Even London and Frankfurt failed to agree on much beyond ground rules for how a full system could work.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the pressure from financial institutions was rising. Last year, a number of the biggest companies including Goldman, Sachs, J. P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank began investing in an alternative electronic exchange called the Tradepoint Financial Networks. Based in London, Tradepoint plans to list about 230 European stocks beginning in July.</p>
        <p>In another challenge, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter teamed up with the OM Gruppen of Sweden, which runs the Swedish stock exchange, to develop a system called Jiway for trading about 6,000 European and American stocks. Jiway is scheduled to start in September.</p>
        <p>Still stung by what they regarded as Mr. Seifert's high-handed and seemingly secretive attempts to cut his own deal with London, market executives in Paris viewed him more as a rival than as a potential ally.</p>
        <p>In the last several months, the Frankfurt and Paris stock exchanges competed in proposing mergers with London. The logic was straightforward: with markets moving toward pan-European trading, supremacy would go to the exchange with the highest trading volume. London, despite sluggishness in some areas, had far more volume than any other European market.</p>
        <p>At the end of March, executives in London apparently decided that their best bet lay with Mr. Seifert. In response, the Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels exchanges pre-emptively announced their own plan to merge and form a single exchange called Euronext.</p>
        <p>Today's announcement in London sets the stage for a new competition. But industry analysts caution that neither Mr. Seifert's iX nor Euronext will complete their merger for months, and it will take even longer before they move their operations onto the same trading system.</p>
        <p>Because different exchanges measure their trading volume in different ways, it is difficult to make direct comparisons. But measured by the market capitalization of their listed stocks, the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges have a combined value of more than $4 trillion -- nearly double the combined valuation of the Euronext partners. The New York Stock Exchange, the world's biggest, has an $11 trillion capitalization. Tokyo has almost $4.5 trillion.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Seifert can truly unite the systems of London and Frankfurt, the sheer size of the combined exchange should give it trading efficiencies that make it easy to draw business away from rivals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seifert continues to push for new partners. He disclosed today that he is already in talks with the Milan and Madrid stock exchanges. Yet he also insisted that he was open to deeper collaboration with Euronext. ''We are open for all reasonable steps in the future,'' he said in London, ''and this includes constructive discussions with Euronext and any other exchange as long as it serves our customers.''</p>
        <p>But if the last three years have proved anything, it is that announcing deals is much easier than carrying them off. Even an Anglophile like Mr. Seifert may find it takes some time before he can make a permanent move to London.</p>
