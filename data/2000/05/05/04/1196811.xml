        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The trend for colleges campuses to become more and more wired (''Unplugged on Campus, but Always Connected,'' April 20) raises questions about one aspect of this change: distance education.</p>
        <p>Online education would give a much wider range of people the opportunity to get a college degree because it would cost less than a traditional four-year education and would be accessible from anyplace with an online connection. It would be a very flexible and convenient institution for everybody.</p>
        <p>But I don't really believe that an education is about convenience. To truly gain from an online education, students would have to be truly motivated and know what they wanted to pursue.</p>
        <p>In a traditional university, students are thrown into an environment where they are pushed in directions that they might not have wanted to go -- through that process, they often find something of interest. Professors are in direct contact with students and can come to know them quite well. They are therefore able to offer valuable feedback and guidance. I am not sure that this level of individualized treatment would be possible through an online education.</p>
        <p>I think the only way an online education could really be of value is as a supplement to the traditional educational process.</p>
