        <p>The Washington Wizards have had an informal conversation with St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis to gauge his interest in their head coaching job, but no formal interview has been arranged, according to a person familiar with the situation.</p>
        <p>The Wizards, though, may still be interested in talking to Jarvis more seriously about the job, the person said. Michael Jordan, who will choose the Wizards' next coach, interviewed the former Atlanta coach Lenny Wilkins on Tuesday. But Jarvis said yesterday: ''I'm not going anywhere.

        <p>Jarvis, whose name is routinely bandied about when National Basketball Association jobs open, said that before he would interview for a pro job, he would alert St. John's and he has not done that. Jarvis, who has taken St. John's to the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament each of the two years he has been coach, coached at George Washington University in Washington for eight years before moving to St. John's.</p>
