        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I never thought I would write a letter in defense of Barbie! Of course we shouldn't idealize physical attributes in our quest for a woman president (''A Perfect Babe,'' Op-Ed, May 1). However, if merely owning a President Barbie inspires in just a small percentage of the millions of girls who will doubtless own this doll the desire to run for president, maybe it's not such a terrible thing. Soon they will realize that it takes more than a small waist and long legs to run for the highest elected office.</p>
