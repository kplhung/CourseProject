        <p>When Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature promised to rein in state debt this week, they seemed to be saying, ''Stop us before we borrow again.''</p>
        <p>On this issue, there has been a marked contrast between words and actions. Politicians here have long talked about debt reform, but debt has kept growing. Even as lawmakers prepare to impose limits on state borrowing for the first time, they are readying a $3.8 billion bond act -- the largest in state history -- for transportation to put before voters in November.</p>
        <p>''We've finally reached agreement on real and meaningful debt reform,'' Mr. Pataki said Tuesday at a news conference. ''That has been talked about for decades in this state, but it hasn't happened before.''</p>
        <p>The Wall Street bond rating companies reacted cautiously to the governor's announcement, noting that no bill has been printed. Aides to the governor insisted that the details would include provisions to address the raters' concerns.</p>
        <p>Borrowing is so deeply ingrained in New York's governmental culture that the state poses the ultimate challenge to those who would seek to restrain debt. For generations, New York has been by far the most deeply indebted state in the nation in sheer dollars, and it now owes $37 billion.</p>
        <p>The second-largest debtor through municipal bonds in the country is New York City. The third-largest is New York State's Dormitory Authority, ahead of the state of California. And the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is planning the largest sale of municipal bonds in United States history, is poised to rise to fifth place over the next few years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki, a Republican who prides himself on his fiscal conservatism, boasts that state debt has not grown as fast in his tenure as it did under his Democratic predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo. That is true, but it has continued to rise at a rapid clip.</p>
        <p>And under this governor, borrowing by the various authorities controlled by the governor has risen even faster than the state's own debts, to $95 billion. The debt reform plan agreed to here this week says nothing about those authorities.</p>
        <p>The core of the plan would ultimately force a reduction in the level of state debt, but it takes effect gradually over many years, so that it will likely be a different governor and a different set of legislative leaders who have to live with its strictures.</p>
        <p>To give the governor his due, he proposed a more stringent set of debt limits but could not persuade legislative leaders to accept them, and in the just concluded budget debate, it was only Mr. Pataki who made a serious issue of debt reform. When budget negotiations appeared to be finished last month, he held up a final deal, insisting on some kind of borrowing cap, even as legislators in both major parties scoffed that he was just looking for a political trophy to hold up as his budget achievement.</p>
        <p>The governor and his aides also note, correctly, that year in, year out, in talks with the Legislature on borrowing and spending, Mr. Pataki has been the voice of restraint -- or, at least, restraint by Albany's standards.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki did not make an issue of debt reform in his first term, speaking out on it only after B. Thomas Golisano, the Independence Party candidate for governor, spent millions of dollars on ads in the 1998 campaign mocking Mr. Pataki's borrowing habits.</p>
        <p>If he runs for a third term in 2002, the governor's Democratic challenger could be H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, who has consistently criticized the state's borrowing and spending practices. Mr. Pataki's advisers are acutely aware that Mr. McCall could actually put the governor in the uncomfortable position of having a challenger running to his right on fiscal matters.</p>
        <p>Robert Kurtter, vice president for state ratings at Moody's Investors Service, said Wall Street would be more reassured by a debt limit in the State Constitution -- something the governor proposed -- rather than a mere law, which lawmakers here are expert at circumventing. ''The state has a long history of, notwithstanding statutes, pursuing the policies it wants to pursue,'' Mr. Kurtter said.</p>
        <p>The plan also does not address ''backdoor borrowing,'' the widely criticized practice of having the authorities borrow money on the state's behalf, with the state making the payments. That is done to circumvent the State Constitution's requirement that any borrowing done by the state directly be approved by the voters. Again, Mr. Pataki has proposed ending that dodge, but the Legislature has resisted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki insisted that there was no contradiction between his talk and his policies, but Mr. McCall was quick to disagree.</p>
        <p>''The rhetoric is just that,'' the comptroller said. ''I doubt the sincerity of the rhetoric, and I doubt how effective any single act will be. There's no sense of fiscal management and debt management. Everything is done on sort of an ad hoc, reactive basis.''</p>
        <p>One reason that state debt has continued to rise under Mr. Pataki is that his administration has not followed a common principle of paying for capital improvements -- everything from maintaining roads to building college dormitories to buying railroad cars. The rule, followed by most states, is that in times of plenty, government pays cash for capital needs, and relies mostly on borrowing in hard times.</p>
        <p>During the boom of the 1980's, New York routinely paid cash out of its budget for more than 50 percent of its capital expenses. But under Mr. Pataki, that figure has consistently been under 30 percent, despite boom times and large state surpluses.</p>
        <p>The plan agreed to by the governor and the Legislature would impose a cap on new debt, year by year, topping out at 4 percent of personal income in 2010. The current outstanding debt is 6.4 percent of personal income, with an average remaining life of the bonds of about 15 years.</p>
        <p>What that means is that new debt can be incurred only at about the same rate that old debt is being paid off, so that the overall figure would remain about the same over the next decade. After that, as old debts are gradually retired, the overall debt ceiling would decline until, after 2020, it would reach 4 percent.</p>
        <p>''Look, it's a start,'' said Mr. Kurtter of Moody's. ''We're not sure how much of a start. And it's certainly better than nothing.''</p>
