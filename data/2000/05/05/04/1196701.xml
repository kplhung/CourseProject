        <p>For American and South Korean soldiers stationed in the demilitarized zone that divides the two Koreas, days begin with a blast of martial music and Communist propaganda blaring from gigantic loudspeakers that North Korea has erected just across the heavily fortified border.</p>
        <p>The monotonous diatribe, which urges ''one and all to join the workers' paradise,'' is often broken by jarring explosions that send the soldiers scrambling to determine whether North Korean troops or wild animals are invading nearby minefields. More often than not, the intruders are mule deer. But sometimes they are North Korean infiltrators who incite deadly gun battles.</p>
        <p>This is the front line of the tense demilitarized zone, a fiercely armed no man's land of barbed wire and big guns, where well over a million opposing troops are locked in a highly combustible standoff in a place that President Clinton once called the ''scariest'' on Earth.</p>
        <p>As the leaders of the two Koreas prepare for their first summit meeting since their countries went to war 50 years ago, the soldiers whose sole mission is to defend against a North Korean attack say the danger of another all-out conflict remains high.</p>
        <p>''With such a heavy concentration of manpower and weapons located in this relatively small area, there is great potential for fighting to break out at any time,'' said Lt. Kwon Byung Su of an elite South Korean front-line unit on border patrol.</p>
        <p>A half-million South Korean soldiers guard the border, backed up by 36,000 American service members and some of the most advanced military hardware available. Their assignment is widely considered one of the most difficult military postings, because the hard-line North Korean government, which has amassed one million troops along the border, seems determined to reunify the peninsula by force.</p>
        <p>The demilitarized zone, a 150-mile-long three-mile-wide stretch of rolling hills, craggy mountains and farmland, was formed by the 1953 armistice. The village of Panmunjom, which straddles the demarcation line that runs down the middle of the zone, was destroyed by tank fire  in the war. But it now serves as the site of truce talks. The northern and southern borders of the zone are lined with high fences crowned with barbed wire.</p>
        <p>Although most clashes in the zone resemble a game of a cat and mouse and are nothing more than saber rattling, they sometimes turn deadly. More than 1,000 South Koreans, 50 Americans and numerous North Koreans have died in skirmishes along the border since the armistice officially ended the fighting.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most notorious incident involved the ax killings of two United States soldiers by a gang of North Koreans in 1976 in a dispute over tree pruning. In a gunbattle in 1992, three North Korean soldiers were killed and two South Korean soldiers were wounded after the North Koreans had crossed into the southern part of the demilitarized zone. Last year, a naval skirmish resulted in the sinking of a North Korean boat and the deaths of at least 20 North Korean sailors.</p>
        <p>Underscoring the threat posed by North Korea, the United States recently distributed 14,000 gas masks to dependents of American soldiers and embassy workers in South Korea. That is because military intelligence officers have determined that North Korea has thousands of tons of chemical and biological weapons that the experts predict would be used in storming the border and taking Seoul, the South Korean capital, 30 miles away.</p>
        <p>Some soldiers said they hoped that the anniversary of the start of the Korean War, which began on June 25, 1950, would remind the world that the conflict had not been resolved.</p>
        <p>''I think most people don't know very much about the Korean War, and they take freedom for granted, or they just don't realize the costs,'' said Phillip McNeal, 21, an Army specialist from Chicago.</p>
        <p>In his two years on the line, Chung Eup, 24, a South Korean lieutenant, has never encountered a North Korean soldier. But he said that possibility was always in the back of mind.</p>
        <p>''Yes, it's stressful, but we think it's every Korean man's duty to serve his country here,'' Lieutenant Chung said as he inspected fences for signs of infiltration.</p>
        <p>Military officials said 1 of every 100 South Korean soldiers have had at least one encounter with a North Korean counterpart in his mandatory service of two years and two months. Many encounters occur on special patrols beyond the southern boundary. Soldiers told of tense, almost surreal, encounters with North Korean troops in grassy fields of the demilitarized zone late at night.</p>
        <p>In those situations, the soldiers said the opposing troops often confronted each other face to face, arms drawn, in a stare down. Usually the soldiers back away from one another and continue on their ways. In one case fraught with symbolism, the soldiers exchanged cigarettes before moving on. Not all such encounters end so amicably, and there have been numerous casualties in late-night gunfights that were not made public.</p>
        <p>Although North Korea has publicly sought to improve its diplomatic relations in recent months, senior United States and South Korean military officials said Pyongyang had also been busy beefing up its military, acquiring advanced weaponry and conducting rigorous exercises.</p>
        <p>''North Korea remains the major threat to stability and security in northeast Asia and is the country most likely to involve the United States in a large-scale war,'' Gen. Thomas A. Schwartz, commander of the American forces in South Korea, testified to the Senate in March.</p>
        <p>Echoing that, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry said that although his agency supported the summit meeting, scheduled for June 12 to June 14 in Pyongyang, it still considered North Korea ''a very dangerous and aggressive enemy.''</p>
        <p>In the past decade, as North Korea suffered a devastating recession and severe shortages of food and fuel, its ability to attack the South with conventional armed forces was widely thought to have declined. But South Korean and American military officials now say that despite economic woes and widespread famine, North Korea has replaced much of its obsolete weaponry, and its troops are well prepared to go to battle.</p>
        <p>In his testimony, General Schwartz said that over the last year, North Korea had done more to arrest a decline in readiness among its troops and to improve its military capability than in the last five years combined. The general said North Korea had greatly improved its ground forces, including the deployment of large numbers of long-range multiple-rocket launchers and self-propelled guns near the demilitarized zone.</p>
        <p>General Schwartz said North Korea had installed antitank barriers; taken new combat positions along major routes between Pyongyang, its capital, and the border; strengthened its coastal defenses; procured fighter aircraft; and taken steps to increase its missile range.</p>
        <p>There is some growing concern in the South Korean military that new draftees have a weakened sense of North Korea as an enemy.</p>
        <p>''We have noticed that some younger troops don't have the same contempt for North Korean troops as past generations,'' said Lieutenant Kwon, a public affairs officer. ''They know that we are enemies. But they also realize that we are same people. It's not like we are Iran and Iraq.''</p>
        <p>Kim Myong Won, 22, a recruit who had just finished basic training and was about to begin his first tour on the front line, said: ''We will fight to defend ourselves. But we really don't consider them enemies. Especially with the summit talks, there is the possibility of reunification.''</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Kwon said that with a little ideological training and field experience, he expected Mr. Kim would eventually see things differently. ''Nothing has changed,'' Lieutenant Kwon said. ''We teach our soldiers to shoot to kill.''</p>
