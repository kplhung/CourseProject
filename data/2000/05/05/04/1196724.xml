        <p>The daughter of Rupert Murdoch, Elisabeth Murdoch, said today that she would quit the company her father controls, British Sky Broadcasting, at the end of June to start her own media venture here.</p>
        <p>Her departure may signal the end of a much-watched rivalry between her and her two brothers, Lachlan and James, to succeed their father as chairman of the News Corporation, which owns 40 percent of BSkyB.</p>
        <p>Ms. Murdoch, 31, has spent four years at BSkyB, Europe's No. 2 pay television concern, most recently as managing director of Sky Networks. In that post, she developed original programming and coordinated production for the company.</p>
        <p>According to BSkyB, Ms. Murdoch will start a company that specializes in television, film and new-media content. ''I have enjoyed my four years at Sky enormously,'' Ms. Murdoch said in a statement. ''It is a company that I have been proud to work for and contribute to. However, now is a great time to pursue something that I have been thinking about for some time.''</p>
        <p>While it is unclear what prompted Ms. Murdoch's departure, the City was rife with speculation. According to several analysts and bankers, Ms. Murdoch personally called and met with several major banks to assure them that her decision to leave the British satellite television operator had nothing to do with the company's future financial performance.</p>
        <p>Her new venture will be the first time in almost a decade that the Australian-born executive will work outside of her father's business. Ms. Murdoch, who grew up in New York City, attended the Brearly private school and Vassar College, has worked as the manager of programming and promotion at Fox Television stations in Los Angeles; as the program director of KTSU, the Fox affiliate in Salt Lake City; and as the director of program acquisitions at Fox's upstart cable network, Fx.</p>
        <p>In an interview with Vanity Fair in 1997, Ms. Murdoch said she and her brothers ''were brought up with the company as an ever-present force in our lives.'' She added: ''There was very little else that we ever thought about as a family.''</p>
        <p>The move comes during a time of profound change and turmoil in the Murdoch family. Mr. Murdoch, 69, recently found out he has low-grade prostate cancer, leading to even more speculation about which sibling will eventually take over the company. He also recently divorced the mother of the Murdoch children, Anna, and remarried.</p>
        <p>Lachlan, 29, is now seen as the front-runner to take over News Corporation. He is the chief executive of News Ltd., News Corporation's Australian unit, as well as the corporation's print operations in the United States. James, 27, may also be considered to run the conglomerate. He recently prepared the initial public offering for the corporation's Asian television unit, Star TV. The company's shares fell 32 pence, or 1.8 percent, to 1,706 pence, or $26.63.</p>
        <p>INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS  Correction:  May 5, 2000, Friday  An article in Business Day yesterday about the departure of Elisabeth Murdoch from British Sky Broadcasting misspelled the name of the private school she attended in Manhattan. It is the Brearley School, not Brearly.</p>
