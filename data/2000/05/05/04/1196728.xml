        <p>Nathan P. Myhrvold, the chief technology officer of the Microsoft Corporation, announced his departure yesterday, joining a wave of executives and senior engineers who have left the company in the last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Myhrvold's exit, however, is not a big surprise. He had been on a leave of absence since last July, and many industry analysts had predicted it would become permanent.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't sure,'' he said yesterday. ''But, of course, there is always the possibility that when a guy takes a year off he'll find that other life more attractive.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Myhrvold, 40, the other life has included digging for dinosaurs in eastern Montana as part of a five-year expedition he helped finance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Myhrvold joined Microsoft in 1986 and has held many positions, but was always a close adviser to William H. Gates, the chairman, suggesting new ideas and new directions for the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Myhrvold brought to that task a remarkably wide-ranging intellect and breadth of interests. He did post-doctoral research in cosmology at Cambridge University under the physicist Stephen Hawking. He has written articles for Nature, The New Yorker and Vanity Fair on everything from paleontology to the pleasures of owning a private jet. He is an accomplished chef, having studied at French cooking schools.</p>
        <p>In 1991, Mr. Myhrvold founded Microsoft Research, a unit that now has a worldwide staff of 500 researchers. Critics say Microsoft has little to show for its investment so far, but the company says work from the research group can be found inside its operating systems, database, Internet media and electronic-book software.</p>
        <p>Before becoming chief technology officer in 1996, Mr. Myhrvold was the group executive in charge of Microsoft's online and new-media efforts. But Microsoft eventually pulled back from trying to be a media company as it failed to make any real progress against America Online. In early 1999, after a management reorganization, Mr. Myhrvold was no longer a member of the executive team that reported directly to Mr. Gates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Myhrvold has founded a company called Intellectual Ventures, and has made investments in an Internet company and a couple of biotechnology start-ups. He will continue as a part-time adviser to Mr. Gates, who said Mr. Myhrvold's contributions over the years have been ''critical'' to Microsoft.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Myhrvold's departure, Microsoft announced yesterday that Rick Rashid has been named senior vice president at Microsoft Research.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rashid, a leading computer scientist, joined Microsoft in 1991 from Carnegie Mellon University and has been largely responsible for building the research group up to its current size. And Dan Ling, a former researcher at I.B.M.'s Watson Labs, who came to Microsoft in 1992, was named vice president for research.</p>
