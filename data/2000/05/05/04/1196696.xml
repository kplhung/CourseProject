        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Relatives Pressured Boy to Seek Asylum, Father's Lawyer Says'' (news article, May 2):</p>
        <p>Juan Miguel Gonzalez's lawyer, in his brief to the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, says Elian desires ''the familiarity of his own bedroom in Cardenas,'' Cuba. The brief continues, ''This father seeks to raise his family where he wants and how he wants.''</p>
        <p>Yet the Cuban government announced plans last month to place Elian, upon return to Cuba, in a group home-school in Havana. This would be for an undetermined period of time (news article, April 18).</p>
        <p>Thus, the two wishes expressed through the father's lawyer are directly at odds with official Cuban plans. If it is desirable to provide counseling, therapy can be most beneficially provided while the child and family are in their own home.</p>
        <p>One doubts that Juan Miguel Gonzalez had much to say in these official plans for his son.</p>
