        <p>Re ''A Political Babe,'' by Patricia Schroeder (Op-Ed, May 1):</p>
        <p>I agree that being a ''10'' is not a requirement for leading the country, but women everywhere should recognize that men, too, are constantly evaluated on the basis of their appearance. We need only to recall Michael S. Dukakis riding in a tank or the new earth-tone Al Gore to realize that dress, manner and looks are important parameters of public perception.</p>

        <p>Until the public has had an opportunity to get past initial impressions, those seeking office had best be aware that acceptable appearance unfortunately precedes policy issues.</p>
