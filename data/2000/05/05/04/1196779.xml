        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Regarding the curtainless ''Late-Late Show, Starring Your Neighbors'' (April 13), my wife and I observed the same phenomenon in downtown Paris where the affluent live. It was a delight at night to have the streets illuminated by well-lighted apartments whose windows were bare of curtains or had sheer ones.</p>
        <p>As far as New York goes, I do not think that too much privacy or security is at stake.</p>

        <p>Regarding the curtainless ''Late-Late Show, Starring Your Neighbors'' (April 13), my wife and I observed the same phenomenon in downtown Paris where the affluent live.

        <p>As far as New York goes, I do not think that too much privacy or security is at stake.</p>
        <p>First, our windows are much smaller than European ones, and their horizontal bars often spoil the view. Second, windows here are generally dirty, so that they have some sort of an inbuilt curtain.</p>
        <p>Finally, most of them are stuck and barely openable.</p>
