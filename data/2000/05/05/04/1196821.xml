        <p>Steve Thomas said Toronto's plan was to avoid falling behind the Devils in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. After all, Toronto's lone victory came in Game 1, when it scored the first goal.</p>
        <p>''If we get a goal or a two-goal lead, that whole trap thing is out the window,'' Thomas said, referring to New Jersey's neutral zone trap.</p>
        <p>Just 31 seconds into tonight's contest the Maple Leafs had to devise a new plan. Toronto forward Darcy Tucker was sent to the box for cross-checking when he whacked John Madden in the back just as play had stopped with the puck safely nestled in Martin Brodeur's glove. The Devils converted the power play, when a suddenly resurgent Scott Gomez backhanded the rebound of a Claude Lemieux slap shot behind a prone Curtis Joseph at 1 minute 41 seconds.</p>
        <p>So, the Devils had the first goal on their second shot and the freewheeling Maple Leafs were once again looking at the neutral zone trap that had thwarted them in Games 2 and 3 of the four-of-seven-game series.</p>
        <p>Even though New Jersey controlled both the zone time and the shots on goal over 60 minutes, the Maple Leafs somehow scored twice in the first period to take their first lead since Game 1. And even though three goals hardly constitute an offensive explosion, it was just enough for the Leafs, who skated to a series-tying 3-2 victory at Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>After Lemieux had briefly evened the score, 2-2, with 5:46 left in the third period on an unassisted goal -- a shot that Joseph kicked back into his own net -- Tomas Kaberle became the unlikely hero. With just 1:35 separating the teams from overtime, Kaberle blasted a slap shot from the top of the left wing circle past Brodeur for the game-winner.</p>
        <p>After some cajoling, Kaberle admitted it was the biggest goal of his career. It was also the defenseman's first goal of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>The Maple Leafs not only beat the trap but Mats Sundin's much-maligned top line finally produced its first points of the series.</p>
        <p>''They must think they have to carry everyone,'' Toronto's coach and general manager, Pat Quinn, said. ''Because they are all over the place.''</p>
        <p>Except for one shift. The Sundin line came up with the tying goal at 10:01 of the first on something of a soft goal. With both Sundin and Thomas trying to chip the puck off the boards in the neutral zone before the Devils could deliver a hit, Sundin found Jonas Hoglund cutting up the ice. Hoglund split the defensive pairing of Scott Stevens and Brian Rafalski -- about the pair's only mistake of the series -- and wristed a shot on Brodeur from off the right post. The puck zipped through Brodeur's wickets and into the net. And on Toronto's fourth shot of the evening, the game was tied at 1-1.</p>
        <p>Six minutes later, Toronto had the lead. This time, Brodeur was beaten on a fluky play by Tucker, who had fanned on a wide-open one-timer from the right wing earlier in the shift. The Leafs won a battle for the puck along the left-wing boards and Sergei Berezin cut through the left- wing circle and attempted to shoot on Brodeur. Berezin fanned, but Brodeur had already committed. The puck slid through the slot to Tucker, who elevated a backhand over the prone Brodeur, off the right-wing post and Brodeur's catching glove and into the goal at 16:02 of the second.</p>
        <p>Not only did the Leafs have two goals in three shots -- Tucker's shot was Toronto's sixth and final shot of the period -- they also had two-thirds of their combined goal total over the first three games of the series just 16 minutes into the game.</p>
        <p>They also had that lead that Thomas had labeled so crucial.</p>
        <p>The Devils outshot the Leafs in all three periods and had the puck in the Leafs' zone longer in every period (25:04 to 16:47 over all).</p>
        <p>The Leafs had one thing in their favor: Joseph, who is as good as Brodeur with a lead. He stopped 34 of 36 shots he faced.</p>
        <p>Although Toronto was unable to establish its wide-open attack for the fourth consecutive game and was outshot, 36-22, it had done something far more important. The Leafs had knotted the series at two games apiece, with the pivotal Game 5 scheduled for Toronto on Saturday night.</p>
        <p>''We're playing tremendous defensive hockey right now, maybe even too defensive,'' Thomas said. ''That's a little bit uncharacteristic of this team. What's good about it, though, is now they know we can play defense really well.''</p>
        <p>''The next stage,'' Quinn said, ''is to establish some pressure in their offensive zone.''</p>
