        <p>The day began as it always does in Mrs. Wetherbee's third-grade class at Willow Creek Elementary School, and it proceeded routinely, from the Pledge of Allegiance through reading, writing exercises, math, science, geography and phys ed.</p>
        <p>But the class itself was unusual in a striking way: Nine-year-old Diamond Forbes is the only pupil Kathy Wetherbee is teaching this year in the one-room school in a remote part of the nation's least populous state.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Diamond has a powerful tool in the classroom -- an iMac computer for class work, homework and e-mail to help her keep pace with schoolmates in larger, more privileged districts here and across the country.</p>
        <p>Unlike most states, Wyoming has not taken a big bite of America's booming economy. Faced with sluggish job growth and a steady exodus of college graduates to other states, state officials focused on Internet access in the classroom as a critical component in equalizing educational opportunities and developing job skills. As a result, Wyoming this academic year became the first state to wire all its public schools -- even those as small and remote as Willow Creek, here in central Wyoming. And there are quite a few others: Among Wyoming's 234 elementary schools, 19 have fewer than 10 students this year. The state average is about eight students for every computer.</p>
        <p>''Every child in Wyoming now has the opportunity to develop to his or her own potential,'' Gov. Jim Geringer, who began the push for statewide Internet access in schools more than five years ago, said in an interview. ''By finding a way to touch every school, the next great leader from business or government could come from that one place.''</p>
        <p>Given Wyoming's rugged terrain and the isolation of many schools, it has been an ambitious and expensive project, $25 million for the first five years. But in financing the connections, state leaders recognized a desperate need to keep Wyoming children competitive or watch the state's economy fade and the population continue to slip, as it has since 1996 to the current level of 479,602.</p>
        <p>The state Legislature approved for every school not only Internet access but also a two-way interactive video system that maximizes teacher skills by allowing, for example, a Russian language instructor to address students in his own classroom as well as those at distant locations at the same time. By next month, all the state's 78 high schools will be connected to the video system. Legislation does not require installation in the middle and elementary schools.</p>
        <p>The combination of technologies, Mr. Geringer said, also demonstrates how businesses seeking to expand or relocate in Wyoming could take advantage of a skilled but far-flung work force.</p>
        <p>It is hard to imagine a school that would benefit from the wonders of telecommunications more than Willow Creek, a one-room, cinder-block school that sits 22 miles off the nearest interstate along a winding gravel road that cars share with cows and sheep. The antelope and llamas apparently know enough to keep their distance. The school mailing address is Kaycee, a town of 400 that is 20 miles away. The nearest city is Casper, more than 80 miles away.</p>
        <p>In planning for the academic year, Mrs. Wetherbee expected to teach three pupils, Diamond and two younger children. But the parents of the other children decided at the last minute to send them to kindergarten in Kaycee, leaving the iMac to Diamond, who has found it immensely helpful on her two big projects this year -- one on the Basque region of Spain, the other, which is near completion, on Scotland. Today, she searched the Internet for recent sightings of the Loch Ness monster. She found nothing new, only pictures from the 1930's she had seen before. ''There she is,'' Diamond said, assuring Mrs. Wetherbee that the monster is female. ''That's why they call her 'Nessy.' ''</p>
        <p>For Diamond, whose mother, Gloria, moved to the area from Casper last year to marry a local rancher, Skip Forbes, the Internet has become an invaluable tool. The computer she uses at home is not linked to a telephone line. ''I learn a lot of card games there,'' she said. But it is clear from her time on the iMac that she has mastered more than that, navigating the World Wide Web with speed, dexterity and confidence.</p>
        <p>As part of each day, Mrs. Wetherbee requires her to consult The Casper Star-Tribune's Web site to chart daily weather and read at least one story. Diamond found the weather easily and was drawn to a story about the ABC television dispute with Time Warner that included a photograph of the ABC studio in Times Square. Mrs. Wetherbee told her that millions of people live in New York City, compared with fewer than a half-million in all of Wyoming.</p>
        <p>Diamond looked puzzled. ''That doesn't make sense,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Wetherbee, 54, a veteran elementary school teacher who plans to retire after this school year, said she volunteered to work at Willow Creek this year, attracted by the remote location -- she earns an extra $55 a month in what the state calls ''isolation pay'' -- the class size and the living conditions. Adjoining the classroom is, effectively, a one-bedroom apartment that includes a small kitchen, living room and bathroom. Grazing cows and deer sometimes wander past the huge satellite dishes that serve the computer and Mrs. Wetherbee's television to peek inside her windows.</p>
        <p>She lives at the school through the school week and travels to Casper on weekends to stay with friends, shop and buy food for the week ahead. After school ends in June, she said, she plans to move to Modesto, Calif., to live with her sister and plan what to do next.</p>
        <p>''To me, it has been a gift to be here, and I think it goes both ways,'' she said of working with Diamond. ''I needed some space after the typical teaching situation. It was not as much fun anymore, teaching to test. Everything had become so structured. But this is a dream. For the first time in my life, I am not managing children's behavior. I'm truly teaching.''</p>
        <p>And Diamond, she added, has vastly improved her learning skills this year, especially in reading, which she regards as her favorite subject ''after recess.''</p>
        <p>Next year, Diamond will have a new teacher at Willow Creek and, in all likelihood, classmates, a change that Mrs. Wetherbee said would enhance Diamond's social skills and improve her confidence, which is considerable already. Without classmates, she sees old friends and cousins on occasion but spends most of her free time with her horse, Smokey, and five dogs.</p>
        <p>Guiding the cursor across the iMac screen in search of the Loch Ness monster, Diamond said she would prefer that Mrs. Wetherbee return in the fall. But even with a new teacher she will still have her old iMac, even if she has to share it.</p>
        <p>''I know Diamond doesn't look at it this way, but with the computer, she has not just been stuck in the little world of a ranching community,'' Mrs. Wetherbee said. ''The Internet gives her the opportunity to see a world she doesn't see at home. I think that's a real blessing.''</p>
