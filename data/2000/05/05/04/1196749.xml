        <p>The results of Tuesday's primary elections for governor in North Carolina set up a fall campaign between candidates with starkly different views, particularly on the critical issue of education.</p>
        <p>The Democratic nominee, Attorney General Mike Easley, is likely to campaign on his plan for a state lottery that would finance a reduction in class sizes in the lower grades. Southern Democrats who defeated incumbent Republican governors in Alabama and South Carolina in 1998 benefited from their support for a lottery, and polls show that the idea of a lottery is popular in North Carolina as well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Easley's Republican opponent, the former mayor of Charlotte, N.C., Richard Vinroot, opposes a lottery for North Carolina, though he has said he would support a referendum on it. Instead, Mr. Vinroot's education plan proposes a system of vouchers intended to give parents greater choice in selecting schools.</p>
        <p>Voter turnout was low for both primaries. Mr. Easley, 50, and Mr. Vinroot, 59, won easily despite spirited challenges from well-financed opponents. With 97 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Easley led Lt. Gov. Dennis Wicker 59 percent to 36 percent. Mr. Vinroot took 45 percent of the vote while his closest competitor, State Representative Leo Daughtry, won 37 percent. Candidates must win at least 40 percent to avoid a runoff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Easley and Mr. Vinroot will compete to succeed Gov. James B. Hunt Jr., who has held the office for four of the last six terms.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Easley and Mr. Vinroot were not the favorites of their respective party establishments, both ran aggressive television advertising campaigns, and they did not suffer for making fewer public appearances than their opponents.</p>
        <p>''The old-style politics may not work as well as it used to, meaning going county to county and shaking hands with a lot of people,'' said Thad Beyle, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ''The new politics of raising money and paying for your media and looking good on TV worked.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Easley, a former prosecutor who is considered a moderate, said he would make education a centerpiece of his campaign against Mr. Vinroot. ''To those who seek to dismantle public education by risky schemes of vouchers, let me be clear,'' he said. ''I will fight you every step of the way.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vinroot, who ran as more of a conservative this year than in his unsuccessful 1996 primary race for governor, asserted that Mr. Easley ''won by promising to spend more of your money.'' Mr. Vinroot has pledged not to raise taxes, but Mr. Beyle and other observers predicted that the state's deepening fiscal problems and the dynamics of the campaign would force him to move toward the center and reconsider his position on taxes.</p>
        <p>The presidential race is also expected to have a significant impact on the campaign. Republicans are counting on a strong showing by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, their presumptive presidential nominee, to help Mr. Vinroot. Mr. Bush is heavily favored to win North Carolina, but the size of a Bush victory could be crucial.</p>
        <p>''If George Bush is a really strong candidate, if he's winning at the level of Reagan in '84 or Nixon in '72, Easley can hang it up,'' said Ted Arrington, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. ''If George is more like his father or Bob Dole, there's a good chance that Mike Easley will be our next governor.''</p>
        <p>In Indiana on Tuesday, Representative David M. McIntosh won the Republican nomination for governor. He will challenge the Democratic governor, Frank L. O'Bannon.</p>
