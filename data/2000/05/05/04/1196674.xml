        <p>Anyone walking through Central Park to Carnegie Hall on Monday evening would have heard a tumult of bird songs, all gloriously out of time with one another or with the tempos of falling petals and shivering leaves. The ''pulse of nature'' belongs to the world of metaphor, but it was a metaphor vividly evoked inside the hall, when Wolfgang Sawallisch conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra in Sibelius's Seventh Symphony.</p>
        <p>What helped was the resilience of the sounds: the splendor and sway of the strings, moving as one body, or the grandeur of the brass, rising to motivate change from behind the scenes, or the fullness, beauty and sometimes strangeness of the woodwind colors. But just as important was the steering of sounds to present the symphony as a single thing, developing in response to forces inherent within it.</p>

        <p>Anyone walking through Central Park to Carnegie Hall on Monday evening would have heard a tumult of bird songs, all gloriously out of time with one another or with the tempos of falling petals and shivering leaves. The ''pulse of nature'' belongs to the world of metaphor, but it was a metaphor vividly evoked inside the hall, when Wolfgang Sawallisch conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra in Sibelius's Seventh Symphony.</p>
        <p>What helped was the resilience of the sounds: the splendor and sway of the strings, moving as one body, or the grandeur of the brass, rising to motivate change from behind the scenes, or the fullness, beauty and sometimes strangeness of the woodwind colors. But just as important was the steering of sounds to present the symphony as a single thing, developing in response to forces inherent within it.</p>
        <p>Nobody was making it happen. Just as nobody maneuvers the clouds to let the sun burst through, so the opening of the symphony, for example, seemed merely -- but magnificently -- to unfold, through dark sounds and opaque harmonic progressions that were moving themselves around to create an opening for sudden woodwind brightness. The work went on in this way, traveling toward its biggest climax, a real yelp here, and away.</p>
        <p>After such a performance, one can understand why Sibelius felt that he had reached an end. Others, though, go on -- among them a fellow Finn and former protege of Sibelius, Einojuhani Rautavaara, whose Eighth Symphony, commissioned by the orchestra, had started the concert.</p>
        <p>The work began very much in Sibelius's territory, with the violas in repeating figures over a long, slow melodic line that began in the furthest bass and urged itself upward. This line, arriving in the middle of the orchestra, stayed around through the first movement, creating one big question that the rest of the work would have to resolve.</p>
        <p>At first it declined to do so. The ensuing scherzo had an appealing character, at once assertive and awkward, and was followed by a quiet withdrawal, which seemed less a full-blown slow movement than an interlude separating one noisy movement from another, the finale. It was a disappointing outcome, with a chantlike theme returning again and again to be met by bells and brass welcomes, producing the effect of film music for a medieval epic.</p>
        <p>Between the Finnish symphonies, Frank Peter Zimmermann gave a beautifully poised, neatly dexterous and classical account of Barber's Violin Concerto. It was perhaps too quiet at times, but this is a player who draws listeners in.</p>
