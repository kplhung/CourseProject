        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your May 2 news article about the distribution of old cellular phones programmed to dial 911 to livery-cab drivers in New York City: I agree with those who tepidly applaud the gesture while questioning its usefulness. I cannot imagine carrying on a conversation with a 911 dispatcher while an assailant holds a gun to my head. Nor can I fathom an assailant who would allow his victim that ''one phone call.''</p>

        <p>Perhaps the Taxi and Limousine Commission could take a cue from the banking industry and consider a silent alarm system: after all, how many bank clerks pick up their cell phones and dial 911 during an armed robbery?</p>
        <p>The police would not only be notified that there is an emergency but would also be able to track the signal emitted from the livery cab wherever it goes.</p>
