        <p>A United Nations attempt to take charge of security in the West African country of Sierra Leone has exploded in violence, with rebels killing seven peacekeepers, all Kenyans, and taking hostage at least 49 other peacekeepers and civilians, officials said yesterday.</p>

        <p>A United Nations attempt to take charge of security in the West African country of Sierra Leone has exploded in violence, with rebels killing seven peacekeepers, all Kenyans, and taking hostage at least 49 other peacekeepers and civilians, officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Rebels of the Revolutionary United Front, who made a grisly name for themselves by chopping limbs off thousands of civilians during an eight-year civil war that ended last year, detained members of the United Nations mission after a series of confrontations in central and north-eastern parts of the country on Monday and Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The violence, the worst for United Nations peacekeepers since 10 Belgians were killed in Rwanda in 1994, is by far the most serious breakdown of a chronically troubled peace agreement brokered last year by the United Nations between the government of Sierra Leone and the rebels.</p>
        <p>The rebels' leader, Foday Sankoh, who became a government minister after the peace deal, has consistently refused to honor his promises to pacify his forces and allow United Nations peacekeepers to move freely in rebel territory.</p>
        <p>Human rights groups have said that Mr. Sankoh does not want peacekeepers in rebel-controlled parts of eastern Sierra Leone because he fears they will interfere with a lucrative diamond smuggling operation he controls there. Diamond smuggling supported the rebels in their civil war and has reportedly made Mr. Sankoh very wealthy.</p>
        <p>Peacekeeping troops responded to the rebel attack by surrounding Mr. Sankoh's house in the capital, Freetown, yesterday. A United States official in Freetown said by telephone that he had received a statement from Mr. Sankoh saying that if hostages were being held by the Revolutionary United Front they should be freed. Mr. Sankoh also called for talks and free movement about the country for United Nations forces.</p>
        <p>A United Nations spokesman in New York said that the rebel leader's house was surrounded because ''the U.N. wants to make sure it can remain in contact with Mr. Sankoh at this time of crisis.''</p>
        <p>''He hasn't formally been arrested for anything,'' said the spokesman, Farhan Haq. ''However it would be dishonest to say he can just pack up and leave.''</p>
        <p>The United Nations Security Council demanded the captives' release and said Mr. Sankoh should order his followers to stop the attacks.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration is ''looking into the availability'' of using C-140 cargo aircraft to fly Jordanian, Bangladeshi and Indian troops into Sierra Leone, a senior State Department official said. The officials said, however, that these troops were not yet ready to go.</p>
        <p>In a statement in New York, the United Nations Secretary General,  Kofi Annan, called the attacks ''outrageous and criminal'' and a ''flagrant violation'' of the July peace accord.</p>
        <p>In Washington, an administration official said yesterday that the United States was looking at ways to see if Mr. Sankoh could be charged with war crimes. The peace deal Mr. Sankoh negotiated last year exempted him and his forces from prosecution for possible war crimes committed during the civil war. But the State Department has said it has credible information that atrocities have been committed by Mr. Sankoh's forces since the agreement was signed.</p>
        <p>The United Nations made an urgent appeal Tuesday night for reinforcements for the 8,500 peacekeepers, mostly Nigerians, Kenyans and Indians, who have been deployed there. Members of the Security Council were asked to transport, presumably in an emergency airlift, 3,000 more peacekeepers to Sierra Leone from Jordan, Bangladesh and India. The United Nations authorized 11,000 troops for the mission in Sierra Leone, but their deployment has been delayed because of lagging troop contributions from member nations.</p>
        <p>The nationalities of the detainees were not immediately released. In one of the areas where attacks occurred, Kailahun, troops are mostly Indian; in the other area of attacks, they are mostly Kenyan.</p>
        <p>A United Nations spokeswoman said the number of dead was based on preliminary reports and could change.</p>
        <p>The killings and detentions provoked strong condemnations from the Security Council, Mr. Annan and the State Department.</p>
        <p>''The situation in Sierra Leone is unacceptable to the United Nations and should be unacceptable to all the member states,'' said Richard C. Holbrooke, the American ambassador to the United Nations, who was in Brussels and on his way with other Security Council members to assess another shaky truce, in Congo.</p>
        <p>Violence in Sierra Leone seems likely to raise more questions about the United Nations' plan to send a force of about 5,500 to Congo, made up of monitors, peacekeeping troops and a large support staff.</p>
        <p>Influential members of Congress have been objecting to paying the American share of the Congo operation, even though no United States troops are being considered. ''We can't turn away from crises like these,'' Mr. Holbrooke said, referring both to Sierra Leone and Congo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan said yesterday that the violence in Sierra Leone could discourage Western countries from taking part in further peacekeeping operations in Africa. He pointed out that countries were reluctant to intervene in the genocide in Rwanda after casualties in Somalia in 1993.</p>
        <p>''And after Sierra Leone, I think there's going to be very little encouragement for any of them to get involved in operations in Africa,'' Mr. Annan said.</p>
        <p>The worst single attack on United Nations peacekeepers was the death of 24 Pakistanis in Somalia in 1993.</p>
        <p>There is a growing sense at the United Nations that Mr. Sankoh will have to be tried for war crimes. ''It seems as if Foday Sankoh is trying to derail the peace process,'' Maj. Gen. Vijay Kumar Jetley, the Indian officer who commands the United Nations force in Sierra Leone, said on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The attacks on United Nations peacekeepers occurred on Monday and Tuesday in two north-central towns, Makeni and Magburaka, and in Kailahun in eastern Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>United Nations officials say that 21 of the captives, including three military observers policing a much-violated cease-fire, were taken in the Makeni-Magburaka area. Twenty-eight captives in Kailahun include two civilian employees and four members of a helicopter crew.</p>
        <p>News from the crisis areas reaches the United Nations slowly because of poor communications and renewed fighting, officials say, so the numbers and identities of the dead or captured may change.</p>
        <p>One of the peacekeepers' major tasks is to get the rebels, Mr. Sankoh's troops and others, to give up their weapons so that a national election can be held in 2001. There were reports Tuesday that at least one attack from Mr. Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front followed the defection of some of his soldiers to the United Nations. When peacekeepers refused to turn them over, they came under attack.</p>
        <p>The House yesterday passed a bill, introduced by Representative Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Connecticut and the ranking member of the International Relations Committee, that calls for $20 million to support disarmament and demobilization in Sierra Leone.</p>
