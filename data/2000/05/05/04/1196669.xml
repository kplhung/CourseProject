        <p>IT'S rare to find such a large selection of frames in a neighborhood shop,'' said Monica Rotaru, owner of Gallery 49 in Manhattan. For the last year Ms. Rotaru has had artwork for her gallery framed at Art:asap, a shop at 415 West 50th Street, where she says prices are at least 50 percent lower than at other stores she has tried.</p>
        <p>The owner of Art:asap, Faustino Grana, offers more than 30,000 moldings, as well as acid-free mats and papers, conservation glass, nonglare glass and plexiglass. He offers framing from domestic and European sources, and welcomes customers who may want to match an inexpensive frame to a $30 poster.</p>

        <p>IT'S rare to find such a large selection of frames in a neighborhood shop,'' said Monica Rotaru, owner of Gallery 49 in Manhattan. For the last year Ms. Rotaru has had artwork for her gallery framed at Art:asap, a shop at 415 West 50th Street, where she says prices are at least 50 percent lower than at other stores she has tried.</p>
        <p>The owner of Art:asap, Faustino Grana, offers more than 30,000 moldings, as well as acid-free mats and papers, conservation glass, nonglare glass and plexiglass. He offers framing from domestic and European sources, and welcomes customers who may want to match an inexpensive frame to a $30 poster.</p>
        <p>''Frames are like pachysandra,'' he said, reflecting on the increasing variety on the sliding walls of his 800-square-foot shop. For three years, customers for Mr. Grana's framing for art and mirrors have included decorators and designers, commercial clients like hotels and office buildings, and retail stores like Gracious Home.</p>
        <p>This year he stopped selling to retail stores, and now he sells directly to individuals at discounted prices. A 39-by-57-inch mirror in an antiqued gold frame is $269, mirror included, at Art:asap, and all custom framing is finished within three days, Mr. Grana said. In the fall he will begin displaying all his frames on his Web site, www.artasap.com, although customers will still have to take their mirrors and art to his shop for measuring and framing.</p>
        <p>Art:asap is open Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and on Saturday till 4 p.m. Information: (212) 956-0805 or (800) 821-4717.</p>
