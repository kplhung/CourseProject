        <p>Sir John Taverner sat near the window of his East Side hotel room, calmly if unsmilingly cooperating as a photographer tried to frame him in the afternoon light. Tall and thin, with long blond locks that cascade onto his shoulders and a deep tan acquired in Greece, where he spends much of his time, the recently knighted English composer gazed into the lens without decipherable emotion.</p>
        <p>''You look like someone from another century,'' the photographer remarked between shots. And in a way that's exactly what Sir John would like to be.</p>
        <p>He is, on the one hand, a composer whose serene sacred works have won him an enormous popular following in recent years. Yet in his view Western civilization generally, and its music in particular, have been heading in the wrong direction at least since the Renaissance, possibly longer. He has been trying to put things right. It's not that he has rejected the last four centuries of musical evolution: his work would not be mistaken for anything other than modern post-atonal music. But since his conversion to the Russian Orthodox faith 23 years ago, he has sought musical and philosophical roots in ancient musical traditions ranging from Byzantine chants to Indian ragas to American Indian music.</p>
        <p>''It has taken me years to really understand what tradition is,'' he said, ''and to explain it to anyone else is difficult. People call it different things. In Islam, the Sufis call it 'the eye of the heart.' St. Augustine defined it as 'the intellective organ of the heart.'</p>
        <p>''It's a different way of thinking about writing music. I used to fret over manuscripts and think, 'What am I going to do?' Now it's a question of going very quiet, emptying my mind of preconceived ideas and seeing what happens. It's not so much a question of finding my voice as finding the voice.''</p>
        <p>Sir John is to conduct a retrospective of his works at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola (Park Avenue at 84th Street) tonight at 8. The performers include the Tallis Scholars; the Flux Ensemble; the Juilliard Brass Ensemble; Patricia Rozario, a soprano who has recorded several of his vocal works; and Sir Paul McCartney, who has known Sir John since 1970, when the Beatles' Apple Records label released two albums of his music. Sir Paul is to narrate ''In the Month of Athyr,'' a setting of a poem by the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy. The concert will be broadcast live by WNYC (93.9 FM) as well as on its Web site, www.wnyc.org.</p>
        <p>Sir John's appearances in New York have been rare. He attended the New York premiere of his popular cello concerto, ''The Protecting Veil,'' in 1993. But when the Greek Orthodox Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity presented an all-Taverner concert last year, the composer said that his doctor prohibited him from trans-Atlantic travel because of his health. His presence is not a sign that his health has improved; this time the invitation came with a ticket for the Concorde, which cut his travel time.</p>
        <p>''What I have doesn't get better,'' said the 56-year-old composer, who is married and has two children. ''It's called Marfan syndrome, and it attacks the main valve to the heart, it attacks the eyes, it attacks the mind -- there isn't much it doesn't attack. And the big danger of Marfan is that you can suffer a rupture at any time, and you go quickly. So I suppose I live with the thought of death very much in front of me, and this may well have a bearing on the way I think generally.''</p>
        <p>It does not, however, explain his fascination with religion, which predates the discovery about 14 years ago that he has the congenital disease. The interest in religion, he said, began when he was 12 and heard a broadcast of Stravinsky's ''Canticum Sacrum'' from the Basilica of St. Mark's in Venice. Several of his early works, like ''The Whale'' (1968), which is about the biblical story of Jonah, the ''Celtic'' Requiem (1969) and the a cappella ''Nomine Jesu'' (1970), have sacred underpinnings.</p>
        <p>But he composed those works in his comparatively secular mid-20's, a time when he was celebrated as a hot newcomer on the London compositional scene. He had recently completed studies at the Royal Academy of Music and had started on a conducting career that included a performance of Verdi's ''Trovatore'' at Covent Garden when he was 24. By the early 1970's, though, he had begun searching for a sense of religious stability. An interest in Russian and Greek Orthodox icons, which he encountered at an exhibition of religious art in London, led him to explore the church's theology, and he formally converted in 1977.</p>
        <p>This was not, at first, good for his composing.</p>
        <p>''When I joined the Orthodox Church,'' he said, ''the archbishop asked me to make a setting of the liturgy.</p>
        <p>''It was very clever of him, because first of all, it helped me get to know the liturgy really well. But it brought me up against a real compositional crisis because the congregation came up and said, 'You don't know anything about the sacred tone systems' and, 'This is just your own fabricated music.' And I began thinking that maybe they're right, maybe everything I'd done up till then was a complete waste of time.</p>
        <p>''That brought me headlong into the whole concept of tradition. I stopped composing, and I listened to Indian music, Persian music, all music from the Middle East. I listened to American Indian music. I listened to any music that was based on traditional ideas. That's when I started to question what on earth happened to this Western civilization and why the sacred seems to have been pushed out gradually by the domination of the ego.''</p>
        <p>His study of ancient, durable musical forms led him to develop a style that, it turned out, was perfectly suited to a part of the new-music world that was taking shape in the mid-1980's. Like the music of Arvo Part, Giya Kancheli and others of the Eastern European mystical school, his works tend to be slow-moving and intense, and in an eclectic, accessible language. And recordings of works like ''The Protecting Veil'' sold plentifully.</p>
        <p>Because he no longer sees a point in writing entirely secular music, his instrumental works, which include several concertos and three string quartets, have what he calls a metaphysical subtext.</p>
        <p>''It isn't important for listeners to know what these subtexts are,'' he said. ''Only I have to know. I have to have in mind what the text would be if the work had one. But people can make of it what they want. When 'The Protecting Veil' had its premiere, one letter that touched me the most was from a young girl who asked if in that piece I was protecting unfashionable values like truth and beauty. Well, the protecting veil is associated with a feast in the Orthodox Church, but if people hear something else, that's fine.''</p>
        <p>Mostly, though, his music is vocal or choral, and although the texts are not always overtly religious -- he has set poetry of William Blake and Sappho, for example -- his music tends to cast them in devotional light. That, it turns out, is not always easy.</p>
        <p>One of the works on the program tonight, ''A New Beginning,'' was commissioned for a performance at the Millennium Dome in London during the final moments of 1999. The text was composed by committee and includes a list of wishes for the future -- ''Respect for the earth, peace in the world, forgiveness of past wrongs, a new start.'' At first glance, Sir John found it too platitudinous and vague to set.</p>
        <p>''I asked: 'Who is this addressed to? Couldn't I at least put an Oh Lord at the end of each one?' '' he said. ''Well, they didn't want to offend atheists, but in the end they agreed that for musical purposes it might be best. Anyway, by the time it got to midnight, everyone was so drunk and there was such a ludicrous party mood that the piece had very little effect. So I regard the performance here as the world premiere.''</p>
        <p>And what, a visitor wondered, do those in the Orthodox Church who disliked his early liturgical setting think of his current work? Do they think he has learned to write sacred music?</p>
        <p>''Yes, I think so,'' he said with a quiet laugh. ''But I'm very grateful to them for being so miserable and mean. Because of that, I've found a completely angstless way of writing music. And the music really does appear to spring from somewhere else. I can't tell you where -- I just don't know.''</p>
        <p>THE CREATIVE MIND  Correction:  May 5, 2000, Friday  Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about a prominent composer who was scheduled to conduct a retrospective of his works last night at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola in Manhattan misspelled his surname. He is Sir John Tavener, not Taverner.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 11, 2000, Thursday  An article last Thursday about the composer Sir John Tavener misstated the name of a performing group in a retrospective of his work at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola in Manhattan. It was the Flux Quartet, not the Flux Ensemble.</p>
