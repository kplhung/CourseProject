        <p>SOLDIER OF FORTUNE does not simply push the envelope for computer-game violence. It seals the envelope, stamps it and posts it, then empties a clip into the mailbox for good measure.</p>
        <p>In fundamentals, this new first-person shooter developed by Raven Software doesn't appear significantly different from similar games on the market. Cast as a mercenary on the trail of stolen nuclear warheads, the player explores a hostile three-dimensional environment through 26 game levels spread over 10 missions, lays waste to a host of enemies and uses an array of weapons and supplies.</p>
        <p>The twist: You can inflict wounds with unprecedented specificity. In most shooters, every hit to an enemy does the same amount of damage, regardless of location. (For instance, in Nova Logic's recent Special Forces shooter, Delta Force 2, you can kill enemies as effectively by shooting them in the foot as in the head.)</p>
        <p>However, 1998 releases like Sin, Vigilance and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six introduced the concept of ''one shot, one kill'' -- with wounds to the head instantly fatal -- and Soldier of Fortune extends that conceit. An enhanced version of Id Software's Quake II game engine allows the player to hit 26 zones on the polygonal enemy bodies, with results that range from the disturbing to the practical.</p>
        <p>Playing with all the violence options enabled, I shot off enemies' legs in the opening level in the New York subways. I shot off arms aboard a speeding freight train in southern Africa. I left chests and groins spattered with blood in the Kosovo sewers. (When enemies fell forward, I could see the exit wounds.) In an Iraqi marketplace, guts poked out of the hole I had drilled in an enemy's midsection. In Siberia, I liberated some heads from their bodies and reduced others to something resembling partially eaten apples.</p>
        <p>And when I finished a level, I was provided with a checklist of carnage performed, including ''throat shots,'' ''head shots'' and, ahem, ''nether region shots.'' These are unusual things for a computer game to be adding up.</p>
        <p>Does the game go too far? Initially, I would have said yes. How many ways should you really see an enemy's head explode? (Soldier of Fortune is not suited for children. Parents and the squeamish will be grateful for a password-protected filter that allows users to disable five violent elements in the full-violence version. A ''tactical low-violence'' version is also available in which the filter is permanently enabled.)</p>
        <p>But it turns out that once you've seen one screaming soldier with his leg shot off, you've seen them all. The effects are shocking the first few times around, and then they begin to recede into the body of the game.</p>
        <p>And there is something to be said for a game that offers enduring evidence of the player's passage through the game world. Details like bullet holes and bloodstains on walls helped make Duke Nukem 3D a huge hit in the mid-90's, and it might be argued that Soldier of Fortune represents the next bloody footstep in this trend.</p>
        <p>The treatment of violence isn't the only creative twist. Soldier takes a novel approach to saved games. Saves are snapshots of the player's position, which enable one to resume play from a given point at a later time. Most three-dimensional shooters allow saves at any point during the game -- a strategy that allows players to finish games more easily, but one that, when abused, can squeeze the fun out of a game by sacrificing its challenge.</p>
        <p>Soldier gears the number of saves allowed to the difficulty level selected at the start of a new game -- from unlimited at the Effortless level to five at the Medium level and none at the Unfair level. At the harder levels, that turns saving from a simple reflex into a strategic decision. Can you finish the rest of an unseen level with the available saves?</p>
        <p>Soldier also takes a step toward addressing reduced capacity in injured enemies. In most games, enemies simply pound away at the player until they are killed, regardless of the level of damage they have taken. Soldier of Fortune interrupts this cycle. A shot to the leg may leave a live enemy hopping on one foot, and the hopping means that at least for the moment, the enemy isn't shooting at the player. You can also force enemies to drop their weapons and surrender or flee the field. The game in which enemies and the player lose proficiency as they take damage still awaits us, but in the meantime, it's agreeable to find other ways to resolve combat.</p>
        <p>Gore finds its justification only in what it adds to game play, and when the novelty of blood-spouting necks wore off, I found myself wishing this advanced damage model had served as inspiration for other elements of the game. The creators seem so taken with the depictions of violence that they have neglected the fear and dread that the carnage should inspire in its victims and perpetrators.</p>
        <p>Enemies with such diverse vulnerabilities should be smart enough to better protect their nether regions -- they are little more than the usual bunch of dumb bunnies -- and engagements should be smaller and more tactical. After all, when you are going up against an army of enemies who are all blazing away at you, you don't have time to try for critical hits. All you can do is survive.</p>
        <p>Perhaps these shortcomings are a sign that although the developer has surely pushed the envelope, it hasn't finished addressing it.</p>
        <p>Soldier of Fortune; published by Activision; $45.99; Windows 95, 98 and NT 4.0-SP5; for mature players.</p>
