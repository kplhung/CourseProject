        <p>In a move that gets one of the Jets' most important players into the fold, linebacker Mo Lewis accepted the current one-year tender for a franchise linebacker -- which is worth $4.187 million -- while negotiations will continue toward a long-term deal.</p>
        <p>Lewis, a nine-year veteran, has been a Jet since entering the National Football League and is the team's most senior player.</p>
        <p>If the Jets had signed Lewis to a long-term deal before July 15, they would have lost the right to use the franchise tag for another player during the duration of Lewis's contract. That Lewis signed the one-year tender -- rather than refuse to sign and possibly hold out during the team's off-season workouts and minicamps -- indicates that negotiations have progressed far enough that there is the hope of a long-term deal.  If a long-term deal is done after July 15, the Jets would keep the right to apply the franchise tag to another player in the next free agency season.</p>
        <p>Lewis was designated the team's franchise player at the start of the free agency period in February, meaning that the Jets were obligated to offer him a one-year deal for an amount that was the average of the top five linebacker salaries in the National Football League. If another team wanted to sign Lewis, they would have had to give the Jets two first-round draft picks.</p>
        <p>Lewis was unhappy about the franchise tag, because it all but eliminated his ability to seek a big salary in the free-agent market. He fired his agent, Ralph Cindrich, the day after he received the tag, and hired Eugene Parker, who has a good relationship with the Jets.</p>
        <p>If the Jets and Lewis are unable to reach agreement on a long-term contract, Lewis would become an unrestricted free agent at the end of next season and the Jets would be unable to place the franchise tag on him again.</p>
        <p>Lewis went to the Pro Bowl the last two years and was voted by his teammates as the team's most valuable player in 1995 and 1997.</p>
        <p>Last season, Lewis was third on the team in tackles, with 89. He also led the team in sacks with five and a half, and in forced fumbles with four.</p>
        <p>''Today is as significant as draft day because today the status of a proven Pro Bowl level performer has been solidified on our team,'' Coach Al Groh said in a statement. ''Mo has a great appetite to win and a tremendous capacity for work. Combine those qualities with his playmaking ability, and it makes me very happy to see Mo.''</p>
        <p>Lewis, who has already joined the team's off-season workout program and will participate in the veterans minicamp May 23-25, declined to comment on the one-year deal.</p>
