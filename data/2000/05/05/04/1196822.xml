        <p>The Mets gave three leads to their No. 1 starting pitcher today. They had four runners in scoring position after coming back to tie the score in the seventh inning. They used all but one of their position players -- Mike Piazza even played for the first time since Friday -- and all but two of their relievers.</p>
        <p>But nothing worked. The San Francisco Giants beat the Mets, 8-5, when Jeff Kent ripped a three-run homer off Turk Wendell in the 11th inning. Wendell, who had worked a scoreless 10th, allowed a leadoff single and a walk -- to Barry Bonds, on four pitches -- before Kent slammed a 1-1 slider over the wall in left field.</p>

        <p>The Mets gave three leads to their No. 1 starting pitcher today. They had four runners in scoring position after coming back to tie the score in the seventh inning. They used all but one of their position players -- Mike Piazza even played for the first time since Friday -- and all but two of their relievers.</p>
        <p>But nothing worked. The San Francisco Giants beat the Mets, 8-5, when Jeff Kent ripped a three-run homer off Turk Wendell in the 11th inning. Wendell, who had worked a scoreless 10th, allowed a leadoff single and a walk -- to Barry Bonds, on four pitches -- before Kent slammed a 1-1 slider over the wall in left field.</p>
        <p>The Giants, who had lost seven of eight games at new Pacific Bell Park before the Mets came to town, will try to complete a four-game sweep Thursday.</p>
        <p>''I just didn't want to get beaten by Bonds,'' Wendell said. ''Jeff Kent -- I can live with that. Barry Bonds, no way.''</p>
        <p>Hampton was trying to recover from his last outing, in which he allowed seven runs in a blowout loss to Colorado. But this effort was not much better, as Hampton lasted five and one-third innings, allowing five runs on six hits and six walks.</p>
        <p>With the bases loaded and the score tied in the sixth, Hampton's 3-1 pitch to Ramon Martinez missed the strike zone for ball four. The pitch was close -- it might have been a little high, catcher Todd Pratt said -- and Hampton was livid, taking a few steps toward home plate and shouting at Umpire Jim Reynolds.</p>
        <p>''I think his frustration is more at himself than anything else,'' Mets General Manager Steve Phillips said.</p>
        <p>Hampton left the park without speaking with the news media. But Pratt said he understood why Hampton was not getting close calls.</p>
        <p>''There's a reason Glavine gets those pitches outside,'' Pratt said, referring to the Atlanta Braves' Tom Glavine. ''He's consistently there, so the umpire sees that every time. But if you're all over, you're not going to get calls like the call today. You're not going to get the flip of the coin.''</p>
        <p>The walk to Martinez was Hampton's fourth that inning, and it brought an end to his night. Hampton threw 113 pitches, 53 of them balls, and now has issued a major league high 36 walks in 38 2/3 innings.</p>
        <p>His first walk of the game was to pitcher Russ Ortiz in the third inning, and Ortiz came in to score. Hampton opened the sixth by walking Kent, and three batters later, Rich Aurilia walked to load the bases. Hampton and Pratt were trying everything -- inside and outside, fastballs and sliders -- but nothing worked. Doug Mirabelli worked a full count, fouled off two pitches, then walked on a slider up and in.</p>
        <p>That tied the score, 3-3, and it was the third time Hampton had squandered a lead. His walk to Martinez gave the Giants a 4-3 lead, and they increased it one batter later, when Calvin Murray singled off Dennis Cook.</p>
        <p>Hampton stood to lose his fifth game, but the Mets tied it in the top of the seventh on a two-run triple by Melvin Mora.</p>
        <p>In the eighth, with two outs and the bases empty, Valentine called on Piazza to pinch-hit for the reliever Pat Mahomes. Piazza was playing for the first time since Friday, when he suffered a hyperextended right elbow in a home-plate collision in Colorado. He is expected to start on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Facing the reliever Aaron Fultz, who was otherwise masterly today, Piazza doubled off the base of the fence in the left-field corner. But he was stranded when Todd Zeile, also pinch-hitting, struck out looking at a pitch that appeared to be outside. In the 11th, Zeile was forced out at second even though shortstop Rich Aurilia seemed to have been pulled off the base by the throw from second.</p>
        <p>''When I make a mistake, I get assessed for it, and I don't think that's true with umpires,'' Zeile said. ''There were some calls that I didn't think were good calls tonight.''</p>
        <p>The only position player Valentine did not use was Rickey Henderson, who was benched against the right-handed Ortiz so the left-handed hitting Jon Nunnally could start. Henderson flagged down Phillips for a pregame meeting; Phillips did not say what the two discussed but said things were fine, and Henderson left without speaking with reporters.</p>
        <p>Henderson had raised his batting average to .211 with two hits on Tuesday, but he has not batted above .220 since the first game of the season. Valentine, who does not believe Henderson has ''found his stroke,'' indicated he would start Henderson on Thursday against the Giants left-hander Kirk Rueter.</p>
        <p>As the leadoff hitter, Nunnally did a fine imitation of what the Mets need from Henderson, drawing seven pitches to start the game before bashing a homer. In his next at-bat, Nunnally walked, stole second and scored to give the Mets a 2-1 lead in the third inning.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>General Manager STEVE PHILLIPS said the right-hander BOBBY J. JONES will make at least two rehab starts for Class AAA Norfolk, the first coming Sunday. Jones allowed 12 earned runs in 6 2/3 innings in his three starts before suffering a right calf strain, and he needs to pitch longer before he can return. . . . Mets' stadium operations officials have begun meeting with Major League Baseball security officials this week on how to prepare for JOHN ROCKER's first visit to New York. Rocker was suspended for controversial comments about various ethnic groups, and fans have been greeted him with hostility on the Braves' current West Coast trip. After some fans promoted a ''Battery Night'' in Rocker's honor at Shea last month, Mets officials decided to start preparing for the Rocker reaction. ''I think it's going to be more of an issue in New York,'' Phillips said.</p>
