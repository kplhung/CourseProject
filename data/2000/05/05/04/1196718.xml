        <p>In a packed courtroom covered with flowery oriental carpets, two smiling young men told a judge today that they had decided to shoot one of the country's leading reformers because they believed that he was corrupt and an enemy of Islam.</p>
        <p>The trial, in which eight men are charged in the attempted assassination of the reformer, Saeed Hajjarian, an editor and political strategist close to President Mohammad Khatami, has mesmerized this city.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hajjarian's plight is the most vivid illustration of the setbacks suffered by Iran's reformers. The bearded young men who say they attacked him out of religious zeal are seen as an ominous reminder of the violence that lurks under the surface of Iran's political turmoil.</p>
        <p>At the same time, in a courtroom in the southern city of Shiraz, 2 of the 13 Jewish men charged with spying for Israel confessed today to charges of espionage, according to their lawyers.</p>
        <p>The admissions do not prove the government's case, the lawyers said, because no evidence has been presented to show that the men disclosed classified information. In all, three of the accused men -- all of those brought to trial so far in two days of closed hearings -- have now said they spied for Israel.</p>
        <p>They and most of their co-defendants have been in prison for 15 months but were able to consult with lawyers only three weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Both trials are being heard in Revolutionary Courts, the branch of Iran's legal system that deals with political and moral crimes, drug trafficking and crimes involving national security. In those courts, the judge investigates, brings charges, prosecutes and renders a verdict.</p>
        <p>The Hajjarian trial is being held in open court attended by several hundred people, with a large yellow banner reading ''The Judiciary Is the Axis of the Islamic System'' stretched across one corner. The spy case is taking place with only the defendants and their lawyers present, despite the protests of family members and human rights groups.</p>
        <p>But both proceedings have focused unusual attention, in Iran and outside, on the quality of justice that victims and defendants receive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hajjarian was shot once in the face on March 12 by a man who fled on the type of high-powered motorcycle reserved for members of Iran's security forces.</p>
        <p>Last year, security officials said that ''rogue elements'' within their ranks had assassinated democracy advocates. No one has yet gone on trial for those killings. One security official who was arrested died in prison while awaiting trial. The authorities said he had committed suicide.</p>
        <p>The two defendants who have testified so far in the Hajjarian case maintained that they were not part of any official group and knew each other only through a neighborhood vigilante squad that had assigned itself the job of attacking those they believed to be un-Islamic.</p>
        <p>They said they had been encouraged to shoot Mr. Hajjarian by an associate who had convinced them that the reformer was an enemy of religion. Mr. Hajjarian was released from the hospital late Tuesday, in a wheelchair and with a bullet still in his neck.</p>
        <p>The shooting raised alarms in Iran about the effect of recent statements of several leading conservative clerics and members of the Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is controlled by the clergy. In speeches and communiques, the hard-liners have justified violence against anyone who opposes the Islamic system of government, and they have labeled many reformers as anti-Islam.</p>
        <p>In the present charged atmosphere -- in which reformers, whose candidates won a sweeping victory in first-round voting for Parliament in February, have been arrested and jailed for insulting Islam -- such talk is dangerous, reform leaders say.</p>
        <p>In a statement quoted today by the official Iranian press agency, Mohammad Reza Khatami, the president's brother and leader of the reform coalition that swept the polls, said those advocating violence in the name of religion harm Islam.</p>
        <p>''Advocates of violence under the current situation present a tarnished image of Islam,'' he said, adding that ''Islam, with such friends, needs no other foes.''</p>
        <p>Support for that view was not on display when two of the eight men charged in the Hajjarian shooting took the stand today.</p>
        <p>Saeed Asgar, 20, the confessed gunman, said in the first session of the trial last week that he believed he was performing his ''religious duties'' by shooting Mr. Hajjarian.</p>
        <p>In the second session today, he said he had not even known what Mr. Hajjarian looked like and had needed a signal from one of his friends to point him out on a crowded street outside the Tehran city hall. On that signal, Mr. Asgar told the court, he walked up to his victim and fired once, then rode away on a waiting motorcycle driven by an accomplice.</p>
        <p>Some distance away, he removed the extra pair of pants he was wearing -- so as not to be recognized by witnesses, he explained. He then went to the movies and paid his water bill at a local bank before heading home.</p>
        <p>''We didn't really want to kill him,'' Mr. Asgar said. ''The agreement between us was to beat him up.'' He added that he did not know why the plan had changed.</p>
        <p>A second man, Mohsen Majidi, said he had provided the motorcycle and the gun for the shooting. He said a friend, who has not yet testified, had urged the attack on Mr. Hajjarian. ''He came to my place and criticized him as a symbol of vice and said he was doing stuff against the Islamic system,'' Mr. Majidi told the court.</p>
        <p>The casual attitude of the defendants appeared to puzzle even the Revolutionary Court judge, who ordered psychiatric evaluations of the eight defendants earlier this week. The examinations, a doctor told the court, found them all sane and responsible for their actions.</p>
        <p>The attitude of the defendants in the espionage trial in Shiraz has also puzzled many observers, including their lawyers, say human rights activists and foreign diplomats monitoring the intensely watched trial.</p>
        <p>On Monday, after the first closed hearing, Hamid Tefileen, a shoe store clerk who is accused of being the ringleader of a spy network, confessed to spying. He made the confession first in Revolutionary Court and then in an interview on the state television. He said he had visited Israel, where his mother and two of his siblings live, and in 1994 received training from Israel's secret service, an assertion that Israel has denied.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tefileen was taken from the courtroom to meet with reporters today and again proclaimed his guilt, saying he had been motivated by money and a misplaced enthusiasm for the Promised Land. Two other men, Ramin Nematizadeh and Shahrokh Paknahad, joined him in admitting to espionage.</p>
        <p>But the lead defense lawyer in the case expressed skepticism at the confessions, which he said were not admissible under Iranian law because they had come from suspects who had spent a year or more in prison. ''The accused may have been sick and tired of his condition and may be willing to say anything to get his ordeal over with one way or another,'' said the lawyer, Esmail Nosari.</p>
        <p>Lawyers also rebutted the Revolutionary Court judge's charge that the Jews had committed espionage under the law, saying the defendants had no access to classified information.</p>
