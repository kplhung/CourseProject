        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As the proprietor of a small clicks-and-mortar independent bookstore, Just Books in Greenwich, Conn., I have a Luddite solution to Michelle Slatalla's urgent quest for her daughter, Ella, to be the first one on her block to acquire Harry Potter No. 4 (''Waiting for Harry Potter in Long Lines on the Net,'' Online Shopper, April 27).</p>
        <p>There is no way for Amazon.com to get the book to her before July 9 -- even with Federal Express. Some superstore chains might stay open till midnight on July 7, but Ella should certainly be asleep by then.</p>
        <p>However, if Ms. Slatalla makes her purchase at her local independent bookstore at 9 a.m. on July 8, she will accomplish several things. Ella will have to eat her breakfast, do the dishes and put her clothes away before she is permitted to obtain her holy grail. And, of course, Ms. Slatalla will be able to support her local independent bookstore. We need all the help we can get -- and unlike Amazon, we need to turn a profit so we can stay in business for the arrival of Harry Potter No. 5.</p>
