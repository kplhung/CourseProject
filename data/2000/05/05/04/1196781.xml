        <p>The Sri Lankan cabinet took emergency steps tonight to save money to support the war effort at the northern tip of this island nation, where government forces are battling Tamil rebels -- and the rebels are winning.</p>
        <p>The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a guerrilla group that is notorious for its suicide bombers, today lobbed mortar fire into a strategic military base on Sri Lanka's northern peninsula in the latest phase of a powerful offensive.</p>
        <p>They are trying to reclaim Jaffna, the city at the heart of the Tamil ethnic minority's culture. The rebels lost the city to government forces five years ago.</p>
        <p>The Tigers, designated a terrorist outfit by the United States, have delivered humiliating defeats to the army on their recent march toward Jaffna.</p>
        <p>They routed the government on April 22 at the Elephant Pass army base, which is on a slender spit of land connecting the rest of the island to the Jaffna Peninsula, and forced as many as 17,000 troops to retreat to the north.</p>
        <p>And they proceeded to overrun the Pallai army base this weekend, moving another step closer to Jaffna.</p>
        <p>''The task was to inflict casualties and get back to fight another day,'' Brig. Palithi Fernando, spokesman for the Sri Lankan military, said today in a telephone interview. ''We're fighting a defensive battle.''</p>
        <p>Today the Tigers were pounding the Kilali military base on the coast, just 23 miles east of Jaffna, with sporadic mortar fire, the brigadier said.</p>
        <p>Apparently fearing that more than 30,000 government soldiers could be trapped on the peninsula -- at the mercy of the merciless Tigers -- Sri Lanka's foreign minister, Lakshman Kadirgamar met with India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, in Delhi today. Before the meeting, he said Sri Lanka had not made a request for Indian intervention but did not rule out doing so.</p>
        <p>But after their meeting, India's foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, ruled out any such military assistance. ''The evacuation of Sri Lankan troops is not India's responsibility,'' he told reporters.</p>
        <p>The fall of Jaffna -- which some military analysts predict may come within weeks -- would be a tremendous political blow to the recently re-elected president, Chandrika Kumaratunga. Her party faces parliamentary elections by August.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kumaratunga, who was wounded in a December attack by a Tiger suicide bomber, was first elected president in 1994 on a peace platform but began a major military campaign against the rebels in 1995 after talks broke down.</p>
        <p>Her greatest military triumph, in December 1995, was the government's recapture of Jaffna, which had been the Tigers' capital for five years and the stronghold for the rebels' unofficial mini-state on the Jaffna Peninsula.</p>
        <p>Now, with the rebels advancing, a cabinet meeting led by the president suspended all non-essential development work for three months, deciding to divert the money saved to the war effort.</p>
        <p>The Tigers have been battling since 1983 for a separate homeland, called Tamil Eelam, for their ethnic group, which they feel has been mistreated by the majority Sinhalese who control the government. More than 60,000 people have died in the conflict. And despite an expensive government military buildup in recent years, the Tigers appear to be stronger than ever.</p>
        <p>In the last month, casualties on both sides have mounted, as have hardships for civilians living in Sri Lanka's predominantly Tamil north.</p>
        <p>Brigadier Fernando said 500 government troops had died since the attack on Elephant Pass. He estimated that 1,000 Tiger rebels had been killed. And each side has had about 1,500 wounded in that period, he said.</p>
        <p>Reports from the front in the north depend heavily on information handed out by the government and the rebels. Journalists in Sri Lanka said there had been no phone contact with Jaffna since the rebels blew up a telecommunications tower there in late March. The government is not allowing reporters into the north.</p>
        <p>Relief agency officials said the plight of the 350,000 people living in the largely Tamil-controlled Wanni area just south of the Jaffna Peninsula was deteriorating. There is no electricity to run the hospitals, and generators are running low on fuel.</p>
        <p>Since April the government has blocked the International Committee of the Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders from transporting many medicines and supplies to hospitals and clinics in the area, saying it feared that the rebels would use the supplies, officials of those agencies said.</p>
        <p>''We're turning people away from the hospitals because we have nothing to treat them with,'' said Gabriel Trujillo, the head of mission for the French chapter of Doctors Without Borders. ''And the situation doesn't look like it's going to improve.''</p>
