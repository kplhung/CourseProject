        <p>Michael Rowe resigned as president of the Nets yesterday and accepted a reassignment to the project the franchise hopes will result in a state-of-the-art arena in Newark for the 2003-4 season. Rowe, the Nets' president since 1995, will serve in a currently unspecified position with Newark Sports and Entertainment, a subsidiary of YankeeNets, on which Rowe is a board member.</p>
        <p>According to YankeeNets officials, Rowe would have been fired if he had not resigned. Officials spent the last several days trying to persuade Rowe to continue working with the organization in a new capacity.</p>
        <p>With the firing of Coach Don Casey last week, General Manager John Nash is the only remaining member of the Nets' basketball operations triumvirate. The club's first priority is to hire a director of basketball operations, who will then decide on Nash's future and lead the search for a new head coach. The director may also serve as the Nets' president if he has a strong background in business.</p>
        <p>''I want to thank Michael Rowe for his dedication and loyalty to the Nets organization,'' said Harvey Schiller, the chairman and chief executive officer of YankeeNets. ''We are fortunate to be able to harness Michael's experience with the Nets and his expertise with arena management to help us with one of our most important goals: to build a new arena for the Nets and Devils in Newark.''</p>
        <p>Schiller will assist Lewis Katz, the chairman of the Nets' operating board, in the search for new front-office personnel. In the meantime, Finn Wentworth, the president of YankeeNets, has been designated as the Nets' acting president.</p>
        <p>Before taking over the Nets' presidency, Rowe had distinguished himself in arena management as an executive with the Meadowlands Sports Complex. But while the Nets' enjoyed off-the-court successes in the front office during his tenure as president, he struggled with the basketball side of the business.</p>
        <p>''When I first met Ray Chambers two and a half years ago,'' Rowe said, referring to the Nets' philanthropic and civic-minded owner, ''he told me one of the main reasons he was purchasing the team was to build a new arena for the Nets in Newark. I am happy to join him in making that dream come true.''</p>
