        <p>The Cable Bureau of the Federal Communications Commission blamed Time Warner Cable yesterday for cutting off ABC television stations to 3.5 million subscribers, declaring that Time Warner's action had violated a federal regulation.</p>
        <p>The F.C.C. said it would separately consider what enforcement action to take, but a spokesman for the agency said Time Warner was likely to face a fine.</p>
        <p>The fine, an F.C.C. official said, will be based on a charge of at least $7,500 per violation per day in the areas that were blacked out. Because seven areas lost access to ABC stations, Time Warner could be liable for seven violations but in any event the amount of the fine will not exceed $250,000, the official said.</p>
        <p>In a statement, the F.C.C. chairman, William E. Kennard, said: ''Time Warner Cable committed a clear violation of F.C.C. rules. Unfortunately millions of consumers paid the price.'' He added, ''No company should use consumers in a private contract dispute.''</p>
        <p>The violation occurred, the F.C.C. said, because Time Warner pulled ABC stations off its cable systems in the middle of a ratings sweeps month.</p>
        <p>Time Warner, after a protracted impasse in negotiations with The Walt Disney Company, the parent of ABC, stopped sending ABC-owned stations to areas around the country, including New York, Los Angeles and Houston, on Monday. The two sides agreed Tuesday to an extended deadline in their talks and ABC's signals were restored.</p>
        <p>The general counsel for Time Warner Cable, Marc Apfelbaum, said in response to the F.C.C. announcement that the company would ''pursue a further review'' of the decision. In a statement, he questioned why only the Cable Bureau and not the entire commission made the decision.</p>
        <p>''While we agree this ambiguous rule needs clarification,'' Mr. Apfelbaum said, referring to the sweeps month rule, ''it is unfortunate that on an important issue affecting the entire cable industry, and where there was no emergency, that this was done without the full commission being involved.''</p>
        <p>Disney executives applauded the decision. Michael D. Eisner, the Disney chairman, said during a conference call with securities analysts that Time Warner had damaged Disney's brand name and reputation by treating ABC shabbily.</p>
        <p>Separately, Peter F. Vallone, the speaker of the New York City Council, met with Barry Rosenblum, the president of Time Warner Cable, in New York and contended that Time Warner had violated its franchise agreement with the city. Mr. Vallone said he believed the company had an obligation to reimburse customers for part of their cable bill this month.</p>
        <p>Michael Luftman, a spokesman for Time Warner Cable, said the company was not ready to announce a rebate but said, ''Our intention is to go further than that.''</p>
