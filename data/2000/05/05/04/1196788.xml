        <p>Faced with lawsuits by 31 cities and counties, the nation's gun companies have broken off settlement negotiations, deciding to rely on their chances that state judges will prove sympathetic or that victory in November will go to George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>The industry's defiance dashes the hopes of the White House and state and local governments that a recent deal with Smith &amp; Wesson to change some of its marketing and manufacturing practices might lead other major gun companies to fall in line.</p>
        <p>Instead, people on both sides of the litigation say, the gun companies,  believing that the November elections will be crucial to their future,  are holding off any further settlement talks at least until they see whether Mr. Bush wins the presidency and the Republicans maintain control of Congress.</p>
        <p>At a minimum, the companies hope that Mr. Bush, who as governor of Texas has been a staunch defender of the industry and of gun owners, will help dampen the growing public sentiment for additional gun control.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, their hope is that a President Bush would help push through Congress a bill outlawing municipal suits against them. As governor, Mr. Bush got just such a law through the State Legislature with the help of the National Rifle Association.</p>
        <p>Even if those hopes are unrealized, the companies calculate, Mr. Bush would at least stop the kind of pressure the Clinton administration has put on them through Andrew M. Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban development, to settle the suits.</p>
        <p>Although the suits vary by city, they generally accuse the industry of  failing to incorporate enough safety features in handguns and of distributing them in ways that make it easy for criminals and juveniles to buy them. The suits collectively seek many millions of dollars to reimburse the municipalities for their costs related to gun violence.</p>
        <p>Robert Delfay, president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the industry's trade organization, said he believed that as president Mr. Bush would work to pass a law protecting gun makers from municipal suits, ''based on his actions as governor of Texas,'' where he signed not only similar legislation but also a tort-reform measure curbing lawsuits against corporations.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Delfay said, the gun companies are encouraged by the prospects mentioned for the Republican vice-presidential nomination, particularly Gov. Tom Ridge, who recently signed into law a measure prohibiting Pennsylvania cities from suing the firearms industry.</p>
        <p>''The industry is looking toward the election as a watershed event on this issue,'' Mr. Delfay said. ''If Bush wins, we could be going in a whole new direction.''</p>
        <p>Paul Januzzo, vice president and general counsel of one gun maker,  Glock Inc., acknowledged that settlement negotiations had come to a halt and that the industry was hoping for sympathy from a Bush administration. Mr. Januzzo said that the negotiations had ''degenerated into terrorism'' with escalating demands by the plaintiffs and that he no longer trusted their lawyers or Mr. Cuomo. He said the industry viewed Mr. Bush as ''anti-lawyer.''</p>
        <p>''If this can happen to us,'' Mr. Januzzo said, ''who's next? If the lawyers are successful with the gun industry, you can be sure they will be out there claiming they have done more than anyone to change society since the Supreme Court in civil rights days.''</p>
        <p>The industry describes the suits, and the negotiations that resulted from them, as an effort by its opponents to win through the courts the kind of controls they could not get enacted in state legislatures or Congress. The companies maintain that a federal law not only barring future suits but also voiding those already filed would withstand challenge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's camp has been noncommittal about whether he would back the kind of legislation the gun makers are seeking. Scott McClellan, a Bush spokesman, declined to rule out the possibility, saying simply,  ''He has not addressed that at the federal level.''</p>
        <p>But in a reflection of their more aggressive posture, seven of the largest handgun makers sued 16 of their municipal adversaries last week, and added New York and  Connecticut -- a step that led the attorneys general of those two states to say they were now considering suits of their own against the industry.</p>
        <p>The gun makers' suit, filed in Federal District Court in Atlanta, asks that the defendants be forced to abandon new policies favoring Smith &amp; Wesson in handgun purchases for their police. The companies contend that those policies, a result of the recent deal with Smith &amp; Wesson, brokered by Secretary Cuomo, are an illegal effort to regulate interstate commerce.</p>
        <p>One big risk in the gun makers' November strategy, of course, is that  Mr. Bush could lose. In that case, the industry's best hope would lie in favorable treatment by judges. And so far, the industry is batting .500 with them:</p>
        <p>Of six cases in which the courts have ruled on the industry's requests for summary dismissal of the suits, three -- involving Bridgeport, Conn., Cincinnati and Miami -- have gone the industry's way. In the three other cases -- involving Atlanta, Cleveland and New Orleans -- the suits have been allowed to proceed.</p>
        <p>One senior gun industry executive said a factor behind the companies' election-related strategy was that the N.R.A. ''has been telling everyone not to do anything till November,  that this administration is history, so don't deal with it.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, a videotape obtained by Handgun Control Inc. and first reported in today's issue of The Washington Post shows a leading official of the rifle association telling members at a closed-door meeting in February that if Mr. Bush is elected, ''we'll have a president'' where ''we will work out of their office.''</p>
        <p>The official, Kayne Robinson, the association's first vice president and Iowa Republican chairman as well, also says on the tape that this is ''a critical election,'' in which a Bush victory will produce ''a Supreme Court that will back us to the hilt.''</p>
        <p>Aides to the Bush campaign did not immediately return phone calls last night about the video, although The Post quoted one campaign spokesman, Mr. McClellan, as saying that ''neither the N.R.A. nor any special interest sets the governor's agenda.''</p>
        <p>Short of enacting federal legislation, a Bush administration and a Republican-controlled Congress  could achieve the same ends through other means. One way would be to tie federal block grants for law enforcement to a condition that any city accepting the money not sue the gun companies. Federal law enforcement aid to cities and states has typically been through block grants, often with conditions attached. The Clinton administration, for example, has prided itself on providing money for the hiring of 100,000 police officers, who, under the program, were required to be assigned to community policing.</p>
        <p>But the lawsuits are now moving  through the courts, and many of the cities believe that they will hit pay dirt in the discovery process, finding material weakening the gun companies' position in the same way that documents about nicotine addiction helped force tobacco companies to settle with the states. Two of the gun cases, in Cleveland and Atlanta, have just moved into the discovery phase, in which the two sides can examine previously confidential material relevant to the claims.</p>
        <p>''This is an industry that has never been investigated by Congress, whose executives have never been put under oath,'' said David Kairys, a professor at Temple University Law School who is an adviser to many of the cities. ''I think they have a lot to lose.''</p>
