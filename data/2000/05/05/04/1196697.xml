        <p>Re ''3 Reassigned After School Rape'' (news article, April 29):</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the sexual incidents that have been reported at a school in Harlem are not as rare, or as easily controllable, as we could hope. I have heard similar reports from contacts at local public schools, all with dedicated and hard-working administrators and teachers.</p>
        <p>My concern is the shifting of blame onto administrators and security personnel. We must ask ourselves how to prevent our children from engaging in acts they do not fully understand. Reassigning two administrators and a teacher in this Harlem school does not address the heart of the matter.</p>
        <p>Let's stop blaming educators who take on the challenge of serving in one of the country's toughest school districts and start focusing on repairing the American family.</p>
