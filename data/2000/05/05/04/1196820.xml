        <p>Just when it appeared that the Devils and the Maple Leafs would be going into overtime, Tomas Kaberle of Toronto found himself alone with the puck on top of the left circle in the Devils' zone. Left without any pressure and with a crowd in front of Martin Brodeur, Kaberle fired a blistering shot that puckered the net with 1 minute 35 seconds left in the game to give the Leafs a 3-2 triumph tonight, tying the Eastern Conference semifinal series at two games apiece.</p>
        <p>Uncharacteristically, Coach Larry Robinson of the Devils pointed a finger of blame, singling out Petr Sykora for not covering Kaberle at the left point. ''Sykora didn't pick up the point,'' Robinson said. ''We left the point wide open.''</p>

        <p>Just when it appeared that the Devils and the Maple Leafs would be going into overtime, Tomas Kaberle of Toronto found himself alone with the puck on top of the left circle in the Devils' zone. Left without any pressure and with a crowd in front of Martin Brodeur, Kaberle fired a blistering shot that puckered the net with 1 minute 35 seconds left in the game to give the Leafs a 3-2 triumph tonight, tying the Eastern Conference semifinal series at two games apiece.</p>
        <p>Uncharacteristically, Coach Larry Robinson of the Devils pointed a finger of blame, singling out Petr Sykora for not covering Kaberle at the left point. ''Sykora didn't pick up the point,'' Robinson said. ''We left the point wide open.''</p>
        <p>The Devils opened the scoring with Scott Gomez's goal before the game was two minutes old, and carried much of the play, but slowed down soon after instead of going for more. They also became careless in their zone and allowed goals to Jonas Hoglund and Darcy Tucker before the end of the first period.</p>
        <p>''We had a great effort at times, but we didn't have the killer instinct,'' Randy McKay said.</p>
        <p>''We also made mistakes by not keeping a guy high,'' McKay said, referring to Sykora's failure to cover Kaberle before the winning goal.</p>
        <p>''You're comfortable when you have the early lead,'' Robinson said. ''Our guys felt that they were going to lay down and die. It's not the way it works.''</p>
        <p>The four-of-seven-game series moves to Toronto for Game 5 on Saturday, and returns to Continental Arena Monday night.</p>
        <p>After trailing by 2-1 since the first period, the Devils tied it on Claude Lemieux's first goal in the playoffs, an unassisted score, with 5:46 left in the third period. The goal, on which Curtis Joseph kicked the puck back into his net, lifted the spirits of the Devils, who pressed for the next two minutes but came up empty.</p>
        <p>Joseph, who had 34 saves, was better on this night than Brodeur, who had 19 saves. Brodeur was not directly responsible for any of the goals and said Kaberle's winner touched someone on its way in. ''It was a tough break,'' Brodeur said, ''but we have to stay positive.''</p>
        <p>''The puck bounced right on my stick,'' Kaberle said of the pass by Dmitri Khristich. ''It was, may be, the biggest moment in my career,'' Kaberle said of his first goal in the playoffs after scoring seven in the regular season.</p>
        <p>Toronto's premier line finally produced its first points in the series, combining for the Leafs' first goal in the game -- and their first in the opening period in 10 games in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Steve Thomas won a battle against the boards in the neutral zone and passed the puck to Mats Sundin. The center relayed the puck to Hoglund, who beat Brodeur between the legs from the bottom of the right circle at 10:01.</p>
        <p>It was the second goal in the playoffs for Hoglund and it tied the game after Gomez put the Devils in the lead at 1:41 with his third goal in the playoffs and second in two games.  Gomez's power-play goal came on a backhander off a rebound from close range on the left. The score came after a shot by Lemieux from the right circle was brushed aside by Joseph.</p>
        <p>The Devils were aided by a foolish penalty. Just 31 seconds into the contest, Tucker was called for cross-checking, having whacked John Madden in the back after play stopped with the puck in Brodeur's glove.</p>
        <p>Tucker gave the Maple Leafs the lead with 3:58 left in the first, lofting a backhander over the fallen Brodeur.</p>
        <p>It was the first time in the playoffs this spring that the Devils entered the last period trailing. They were the better team in the first half of the period but there were no quality chances by either team until Lemieux tied it.</p>
        <p>''If you score and don't win, it's not fun,'' Lemieux said. ''It seemed that every time we made a mistake, it cost us.''</p>
        <p>Bobby Holik attributed the loss to turnovers by the Devils. ''We can't afford to turn it over,'' Holik said. ''They want the open ice and we gave it to them.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>For the fifth consecutive game, or since the third game of the series with the Florida Panthers, Devils Coach LARRY ROBINSON went with the same lineup. . . . The Maple Leafs brought in JEFF FARKAS for Game 4 in place of GERALD DIDUCK, who is nursing a leg injury. . . . It took two games into the second round before the Devils had their first sellout at home, the last team in the playoffs to have a capacity crowd at home. . . . JOHN McMULLEN, who was at Continental Arena at least three hours before the game, said he felt ''so much remorse'' about selling the Devils to YankeeNets.</p>
