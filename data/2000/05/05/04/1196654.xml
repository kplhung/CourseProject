        <p>LIZ PARELLA had a big problem. She needed to sell a Baldwin baby grand piano that was taking up too much space in her Manhattan apartment. She got in touch with an antiques dealer, but the dealer offered her only $1,000, far less than what she thought the piano was worth.</p>
        <p>By chance, Mrs. Parella, a secretary at a  financial management firm, saw a magazine advertisement for an eBay broker service.

        <p>LIZ PARELLA had a big problem. She needed to sell a Baldwin baby grand piano that was taking up too much space in her Manhattan apartment. She got in touch with an antiques dealer, but the dealer offered her only $1,000, far less than what she thought the piano was worth.</p>
        <p>By chance, Mrs. Parella, a secretary at a  financial management firm, saw a magazine advertisement for an eBay broker service. Although she knew about online auctions, at that point she had never used the Internet. On a whim, she decided to give the broker a call and subsequently entered the online auction market by proxy.</p>
        <p>As the term implies, eBay brokers photograph, list, sell and ship auction items for people who cannot do it themselves or do not want to. Some people, like Mrs. Parella, say they do not have the online know-how needed to list an item for sale. Others just want to avoid what they consider to be the hassle of posting, selling and shipping items.</p>
        <p>Liz Temkin, the eBay broker who sold Mrs. Parella's piano, said: ''I got the idea from observing that a lot of people I knew were interested in selling things online but just didn't have the time. We live in a very service-driven society. I've been a booker at Ford Models; I've sold real estate. I've always been involved in customer service. This is just another way of using my talents.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Temkin, a full-time eBay broker in New York, charges a flat-rate listing fee of $10 and a 25 percent commission on each item's sale price (with no extra charge for eBay's fees). The listing fee is nonrefundable even if an item does not sell, and that happens frequently, especially with items that have high reserve prices, the lowest prices sellers say they will take.</p>
        <p>Unlike antiques dealers or secondhand-goods dealers, Ms. Temkin does not set prices. She lets customers decide how much they want for each item. If they do not know, she will help them find reputable appraisers. ''Most people know exactly what they have is worth,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Temkin, who said she was doing very well with her business, specializes in expensive items like jewelry and art. She will not accept items like $5 Beanie Babies or $50 home furnishings. ''By the time someone pays my commission and listing fee, it would cost them more than if they just gave it away to charity,'' Ms. Temkin said.</p>
        <p>Mike and Cheryl DeWolfe, brokers in Victoria, British Columbia, also limit the types of items they list. They specialize in store liquidations and collectibles and have sold board games, knickknacks and figurines on eBay for clients, most of whom find them through word-of-mouth. Mr. DeWolfe also runs a Web development service.</p>
        <p>The DeWolfes have expanded their eBay business to include buyer services. A customer, usually a collector, can hire them to find a specific item and purchase it.</p>
        <p>''My wife goes online for a customer -- she can usually get an item cheaper online for a collector than she can if she buys it locally, even with our commission,'' Mr. DeWolfe said. The DeWolfes' commission is 50 percent of the seller's profit on an item. They spend 30 to 35 hours each week scrutinizing eBay's millions of listings and buying and selling items for customers.</p>
        <p>The DeWolfes also cater to clients with items too inexpensive for them to list. They offer such customers coaching and computer templates that make it easy to post items on eBay.</p>
        <p>Brokering is more of a sideline for Steve Eaton, the owner of the Hotlink Cyber Cafe in Romeo, Mich. Mr. Eaton, who advertises his service in the local newspaper, and his store manager, Amber Mills, sell items like wall hangings, Pokemon cards and computer equipment for customers. Most of their customers are, like Mrs. Parella was, people who have never been online.</p>
        <p>''Customers can come in, bring their item, and we take care of everything,'' Mr. Eaton said. ''We scan or photograph the item, take care of the posting and bidding process and handle the payment and shipping.''</p>
        <p>Even with the commission and listing fees, which are much higher than the 1.25 percent to 5 percent commission and listing fee of 25 cents to $2 that eBay charges, most eBay broker users come out ahead, compared with what they would pay an offline consignment shop.</p>
        <p>Most consignment stores charge a commission of 30 percent to 50 percent, based on each item's sale price. Most will not take large items, like the piano that Mrs. Parella sold. And upscale auction houses, like Christie's and Sotheby's, will not bother with inexpensive items.</p>
        <p>Although eBay brokers are starting to be seen across the country, their services are not available directly through eBay, said Matt Bannick, the company's vice president for product and community. Instead, eBay will integrate a question-and-answer service offered by Keen.com into the eBay site so users can help others. Under a three-year agreement announced on Tuesday, eBay users will be able to pay a fee for answers to questions about how to list and buy items.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bannick said eBay's community boards also offered help. ''People can post questions and other users post responses,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Over all, Mrs. Parella is pleased with her experiences with an eBay broker. Two weeks after the antiques dealer offered her $1,000, her piano sold for just under $4,000 on eBay. Since listing her piano, Mrs. Parella has used Ms. Temkin's service six additional times to list two Japanese woodblock prints, two handbags, a necklace and a bracelet. Although only four of her seven items sold, Mrs. Parella said she would use the eBay broker service again.</p>
        <p>''For items that she wouldn't be interested in selling, we might do it ourselves,'' Mrs. Parella said. ''But using someone like Liz, who is extremely professional and kept us from having to deal with e-mail and all the bother, is a real time saver.</p>
        <p>''It's wonderful to sell things and get rid of stuff. Downsizing is great when you're not just throwing things away.''</p>
