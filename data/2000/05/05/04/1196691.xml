        <p>In an age when gadgets let e-mail and the Web follow people virtually everywhere, a portable fax machine and photocopier seems like a  quaint idea. But Dave Faulkner, product manager for Thomson Multimedia, says business travelers are still addicted to paper. And by his calculations, at least, it's a costly habit. ''Most hotel chains throughout the U.S. charge quite a bit of money to make photocopies or send faxes,'' he said. ''It's a premium service.''</p>
        <p>The RCA Docuport, made by Thomson, is a way for business travlelers to bring the fax and photocopier along for the trip, and it adds a scanner for good measure. With a thickness of just 1 1/4 inches when folded and a length of 12 inches, the device should fit into most briefcases or laptop cases. It contains a rechargeable battery and also runs from standard wall outlets.</p>

        <p>In an age when gadgets let e-mail and the Web follow people virtually everywhere, a portable fax machine and photocopier seems like a  quaint idea. But Dave Faulkner, product manager for Thomson Multimedia, says business travelers are still addicted to paper. And by his calculations, at least, it's a costly habit. ''Most hotel chains throughout the U.S. charge quite a bit of money to make photocopies or send faxes,'' he said. ''It's a premium service.''</p>
        <p>The RCA Docuport, made by Thomson, is a way for business travlelers to bring the fax and photocopier along for the trip, and it adds a scanner for good measure. With a thickness of just 1 1/4 inches when folded and a length of 12 inches, the device should fit into most briefcases or laptop cases. It contains a rechargeable battery and also runs from standard wall outlets.</p>
        <p>The $299 portable office, however, does have some compromises. At two and a half pages a minute, it is not the world's fastest copier, and a maximum resolution of 400 dots per inch does not make it the sharpest. To avoid in-flight disasters involving leaking ink or toner cartridges, the Docuport uses special (and more expensive) thermal imaging paper. But Mr. Faulkner says the current generation of thermal paper is not as glossy as the older type, is  substantially thicker, doesn't curl and will go five years without fading.</p>
