        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read, with sadness, the obituary of David Merrick (front page, April 27). David was really a unique force in the American theater.</p>
        <p>I remember him more than 50 years ago when he was making his transition from Herman Shumlin's office to being an independent producer. He wanted me to play a part in one of his first productions. The financing fell through, so I accepted an offer to go to Hollywood to make my first picture, ''The Strange Love of Martha Ivers.''</p>
        <p>I will never forget the day I left New York. David walked with me to the train station. We didn't take a cab. He gave me some good advice and helped me at a time when I was filled with trepidation. With all his idiosyncrasies, David Merrick was a wonderful man.</p>
