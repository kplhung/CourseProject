        <p>After Forced Servitude, Deaf Mexicans Resettle</p>
        <p>When news of their captivity broke in July 1997, some of the 51 deaf Mexican immigrants had been beaten, tortured with stun guns and forced to work long hours for negligible pay. They had been smuggled here and forced to sell trinkets on the subways and give their profits to their bosses.</p>
        <p>But life has improved for the 34 who remain in New York. (Thirteen adults and their 4 children voluntarily returned to Mexico in July 1998.) Some found jobs and are living independently, said Ariadna Renteria-Torres, their Legal Aid lawyer, and none are working in the subways.</p>

        <p>After Forced Servitude, Deaf Mexicans Resettle</p>
        <p>When news of their captivity broke in July 1997, some of the 51 deaf Mexican immigrants had been beaten, tortured with stun guns and forced to work long hours for negligible pay. They had been smuggled here and forced to sell trinkets on the subways and give their profits to their bosses.</p>
        <p>But life has improved for the 34 who remain in New York. (Thirteen adults and their 4 children voluntarily returned to Mexico in July 1998.) Some found jobs and are living independently, said Ariadna Renteria-Torres, their Legal Aid lawyer, and none are working in the subways.</p>
        <p>The city has found public housing for those who stayed. It has hired the Lexington Center for the Deaf to give them vocational training, classes in American Sign Language and help in finding homes.</p>
        <p>The immigrants petitioned to stay in the country under the S visa, given to people who make significant contributions to criminal cases and who would face danger in their home countries. Their captors, 18 men and women, pleaded guilty and were sentenced to prison in the United States or deported to Mexico.</p>
        <p>Twenty workers received visas, and 14 are still waiting. All were allowed to work in the country, said Mark Thorn of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</p>
        <p>A law enforcement official close to the case said the Mexican government has said it will allow the United States to extradite Renato Paoletti Lemus, considered one of the leaders of the ring.</p>
        <p>Tower in Hunters Point Wins Over Neighbors</p>
        <p>In a Queens neighborhood that prided itself on its mix of smaller residential and industrial buildings, a three-year-old, 42-story apartment building has fit right in, some residents say. Despite initial protests, some neighbors in Hunters Point, part of Long Island City, seem to have adjusted to the Citylights building, the first of the proposed Queens West development, although when the site's 18 other buildings are completed, they may react differently.</p>
        <p>''The neighborhood seems to have come alive,'' said Jim Romano, 60, a retired city employee who has lived in Hunters Point all his life. ''There are a lot more people now. It's good for business and it really livens up the neighborhood a lot.''</p>
        <p>Al Benevento, a manager of a printing company, said the tower had not changed the neighborhood much, ''outside of driving up the property valuation.'' He added, ''They charge so much money over there.'' A two-bedroom co-op apartment on an upper floor of Citylights now costs about $210,000, plus a maintenance fee of $2,180.</p>
        <p>Thomas Paino, chairman of the Hunters Point Community Coalition, said commercial rents along Vernon Boulevard have skyrocketed, leaving many vacancies. Four hardware stores left recently, he said. He also worries that open space in western Queens, already dismally small, will decrease with the development. And he is amazed by the number of people searching for apartments in Hunters Point.</p>
        <p>''You see more curtains going up in industrial buildings,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Anna Finn, 43, a systems information manager in Manhattan, recently bought her childhood home in Hunters Point from her mother. She has seen an influx of younger people and artists, and she has enjoyed visiting the waterfront park by the building.</p>
        <p>''I don't think you'd want to live anywhere else,'' she said. ''It's a nice area.''</p>
        <p>But with ground to be broken in the fall for a 372-unit apartment building, she worries about losing any view of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''They're supposed to build a few more like that, and that'll just kill everything.''</p>
