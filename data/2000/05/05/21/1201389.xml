        <p>His other personality disappeared by the time the Yankees lost in the bottom of the ninth inning, leaving the gregarious side of David Cone to wander the clubhouse and apologize for nasty words uttered when he was pitching against the Indians today.</p>
        <p>Evidently, he snapped at Charlie Wonsowicz, the Yankees' batting practice pitcher and video coordinator. ''Don't worry about it, man,'' Wonsowicz said, reassuring Cone. ''Hey, I understand.''</p>
        <p>Teammates will forever forgive Cone's game-day temper as a sign of how much he cares. His teammates desperately want him to win, having watched the way he evolves, adjusts, compensates for the zip his fastball is gradually losing.</p>
        <p>Cone threw well today, relying more on his curveball, but the Yankees could not pad an early two-run lead and Cone could not hold that advantage, betrayed by his defense in the end. The Indians broke a ninth-inning tie when reliever Jeff Nelson walked four batters and forced home a run with two outs in the ninth as the Indians won, 3-2.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are 24-15, one game behind Boston in the American League East, and they are 4-1 against the Indians here.</p>
        <p>''It's about time we beat those guys,'' said Omar Vizquel, the Indians' shortstop.</p>
        <p>The season was 26 days old when Cone won a decision for the first time this season, and 22 more days have passed without another victory. At this stage in his career, it is as if Cone is given a completely different set of physical tools every season, and every season he must figure out how to implement them in the best way possible.</p>
        <p>His slider was his best pitch for years, and now he finds it is not consistently sharp. His fastball has diminished just slightly, and opponents who have faced him say he does not have the same arm extension as he did a couple of years ago. Rather, he is throwing with his right arm closer to his body, bent at the elbow.</p>
        <p>So Cone makes changes. A different place on the pitching rubber. Far fewer sliders. Many more curveballs, at 70 to 73 miles an hour, mixed with fastballs of 86 to 88 m.p.h. Because there is a great difference in the speeds of his breaking ball and fastball, he has kept hitters off-balance. He also had a good split-fingered fastball today, using it with effectiveness against the likes of Jim Thome.</p>
        <p>''He didn't have good velocity,'' Indians Manager Charlie Manuel said. ''But he's a pro. He's not afraid to throw what he's got.''</p>
        <p>Cone shut out the Indians for the first six innings, holding Cleveland hitless on six at-bats with runners in scoring position. ''I had a much better mix today through six innings,'' Cone said.</p>
        <p>Pitted against the Indians' Chuck Finley, Cone had a 2-0 lead into the seventh, but it could have been much larger. Bernie Williams seemed to break belatedly off first base in the first inning and had to stop at third base on Jorge Posada's two-out double. Indians right fielder Manny Ramirez, often a defensive liability, made three terrific catches today and saved at least four runs.</p>
        <p>In the sixth inning, Ramirez hustled back toward the right-field fence on a drive by Alfonso Soriano and reached up, appearing to turn his head and lose sight of the ball. But he caught it anyway.</p>
        <p>Cone carried the 2-0 edge into the bottom of the seventh and hung a curveball that Richie Sexson whacked into the left-field stands.</p>
        <p>Enrique Wilson hit a liner to left, a position Lance Johnson was manning for the first time since Sept. 10, 1990, and the ball glanced off Johnson's glove. Johnson said later he lost the ball in the lights. Cone was relieved after Einar Diaz's sacrifice bunt, and he watched anxiously from the bench as Mike Stanton pitched to Kenny Lofton with a one-run lead. Lofton slapped a short fly to left-center, where Johnson -- who has a poor throwing arm -- made the catch on the run and threw home, too late to get Wilson. Tie game. Cone got up and left the dugout.</p>
        <p>''I have no complaints,'' Cone said. ''I'm not going to complain about run support or tough luck. I had a lead and let it get away.''</p>
        <p>Nelson entered in the eighth, the score still tied, and escaped a jam when Travis Fryman lined into a double play with the potential lead run at third. But with two outs and a runner at first in the ninth, Nelson walked Lofton, then Vizquel, loading the bases. The crowd roared as Nelson struggled to find the proper arm slot in his delivery. The Yankee reliever got ahead of Roberto Alomar one ball and two strikes, then threw a ball high, and another.</p>
        <p>Full count. Nelson fired a fastball so high that Alomar had to fall back to get out of the way, and the game was over. ''It was just one of those days,'' Nelson said. ''I don't ever try go out there and walk guys like that.''</p>
        <p>Nelson can find some solace in the fact that his record is 6-1. Cone is 1-3 for the season, stuck on 181 career victories, trying, searching.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>SHANE SPENCER left the game with a strained left hamstring, an injury that occurred as he rounded first base in the third inning. As of now, the Yankees believe the injury won't force Spencer to the 15-day disabled list. ROBERTO KELLY is already sidelined with a sprained elbow and it seems more and more likely he will require surgery that will end his season.</p>
