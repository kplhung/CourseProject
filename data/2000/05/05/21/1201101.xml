        <p>WHEN New Jersey's Education Network of Christian Home Schoolers began holding conventions 10 years ago, the group of about 500 parents would meet in church halls and basements, exchanging ideas and giving one another support.</p>
        <p>This year, more than 2,200 parents and children gathered at the Garden State Exhibit Center, where 35 workshops were held and 140 vendors and recruiters hawked books, school supplies and colleges.</p>
        <p>As the numbers of parents educating children at home has  increased over the past decade -- 1.7 million home-schooled students throughout the United States and more than 20,000 in New Jersey -- the convention has also had to gear more workshops and sessions to older students who are getting ready to make the transition from the teachings of their parents to colleges and the workplace.</p>
        <p>''We've had more requests for college and high school things,'' said Carla Abrams, a mother from Hewitt who is home schooling four children.</p>
        <p>While many parents were pushing strollers around the convention here early this month, Mrs. Abrams' session on ''Preparing for High School and College'' drew a standing-room-only crowd. There were also sessions on ''The Triumphant Teen'' and ''Meeting Admission Standards for College: Dos and Don'ts.''</p>
        <p>''There's been an increase in awareness that we have to meet those needs,'' said John Carrasquillo, president of the network.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Abrams told parents and teenagers that if they planned to attend college after home schooling they needed to learn study skills, how to manage their time and how to interact in a group -- even a quick reminder on raising their hands.</p>
        <p>''They need to develop their writing skills and know what an essay is,'' she said to an audience busy jotting down notes. An 18-page guide she distributed included a recommended literature list, a sample student evaluation form and transcripts and a list of essential tests, including the SAT, ACT, PSAT and the SAT II tests on specific subject areas.</p>
        <p>''SAT's talk loudly to colleges for home schoolers,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She encouraged parents to keep lists of everything their children read if they were interested in applying to college, noting, ''One thing colleges are impressed with is that home schoolers read.''</p>
        <p>Next to the companies that sold books and curriculums at the convention, representatives of several colleges disteributed material. Nyack College, a Christian college in Nyack-on-the-Hudson, gave out brochures describing grants for home-schooled students.</p>
        <p>''The home schoolers I know are very bright students and doing well,'' said Jason Maysonet, the admissions counselor staffing the Nyack booth. ''We are interested in offering them an opportunity to go to a Christian college.''</p>
        <p>Home-school advocates and admissions officers agreed that for the most part, colleges today are open to home-schoolers.</p>
        <p>''Colleges are changing their policies toward home-school students,'' said Ray Stoever, the secretary-treasurer of the home-school network. ''Before, they treated them as dropouts.''</p>
