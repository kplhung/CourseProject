        <p>The Night Inspector  By Frederick Busch. Ballantine, $14.</p>
        <p>A former Union sniper, wearing a mask to conceal a wound sustained in the Civil War, wanders the streets of lower Manhattan, where he befriends a forgotten writer who resembles Melville. This novel ''is a marvelously dark-hued story by a master craftsman,'' John Crowley said here in 1999. ''His prose and his conversations are precisely, surprisingly and thoroughly of their time.''</p>
        <p>Cryptonomicon  By Neal Stephenson. HarperPerennial, $16.</p>
        <p>This overstuffed picaresque novel is an audaciously conceived tale of code making and code breaking. It takes place both during World War II, when the Allies were scrambling to break the Nazis' Enigma code, and in the present day, when a couple of entrepreneurial computer hackers are trying to create a ''data haven'' for encrypted information in the Philippines. With its profusion of plot lines, characters and gonzo riffs, the book is ''as fascinating, and as frustrating, as a string of partly decrypted code,'' Dwight Garner wrote in these pages last year. ''It wants to blow your mind while keeping you well fed and happy. . . . It's brain candy for bitheads.''</p>
        <p>The Good Man of Nanking: The Diaries of John Rabe  Edited by Erwin Wickert. Vintage, $14.</p>
        <p>The author, a German businessman and Nazi supporter, not only witnessed the Japanese massacre in Nanking in 1937, he also saved the lives of many poor Chinese. His unpolemical account ''is at once riveting, inspiring, terrifying and tragically sad,'' Sheryl WuDunn wrote here in 1998. It is ''compassionate and, at times, humorous.'' The Sextants of Beijing: Global Currents in Chinese History, by Joanna Waley-Cohen (Norton, $14.95), surveys the history of China's ambivalent relations with the outside world and seeks to shatter the myth that the nation traditionally has been deeply isolationist. Last year our reviewer, Nicholas D. Kristof, disagreed with much of the thesis but found this to be a ''thoughtful and highly readable'' book.</p>
        <p>Broadway Babies Say Goodnight: Musicals Then and Now  By Mark Steyn. Routledge, $17.</p>
        <p>A columnist and critic offers an irreverent history of the Broadway musical, a diverse and lively art form that, judging from the flood of revivals these days, may be in its death throes. Last year in the Book Review, Robert Gottlieb called this an ''eccentric, funny, shrewd and somewhat dismaying book.''</p>
        <p>The Palace  By Lisa St. Aubin de Tern. Ecco/HarperCollins, $13.</p>
        <p>The narrator of this exotic fairy tale is a former political prisoner who assumes a gentleman's guise, makes a fortune as a gambler in 19th-century Venice and builds a dream house for the woman he loves. Last year our reviewer, David Willis McCullough, admired the novel's ''lovingly rendered descriptive prose'' and its ''sensuous and sinuous portrait of the city.''</p>
        <p>Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate  By Bob Woodward. Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, $16.</p>
        <p>The celebrated investigative journalist examines how the rules of presidential politics have changed since the Nixon administration, dwelling in depth on the Clinton White House and its efforts to manage the Whitewater, Lewinsky and other scandals. ''Some of Woodward's judgments are shrewd and plausible,'' Michael Lind wrote in these pages in 1999.</p>
        <p>Timbuktu  By Paul Auster. Picador USA, $11.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bones, this novel's canine protagonist, roams urban, suburban and rural America looking for a home (and spiritual enlightenment) after the death of his beloved longtime companion, a homeless man from Brooklyn. Last year our reviewer, Jim Shepard, praised the tale's ''periodic flashes of gorgeous prose.''</p>
        <p>Disowned by Memory: Wordsworth's Poetry of the 1790s  By David Bromwich. University of Chicago, $15.</p>
        <p>The author explores the crucial years of the poet's moral development, when his republican ardor was transformed by the Terror that followed the French Revolution. ''Bromwich is a rigorous critic, but he is a general one whose insights are broadly applicable,'' Vijay Seshadri wrote here in 1999. The same publisher has reissued The Pleasures of the Imagination: English Culture in the Eighteenth Century, by John Brewer ($20), a grand tour of the world of fine arts and literature during a time when culture moved from the court into the public domain, to be possessed as well as consumed. ''Brewer gives us a brilliantly illustrated social history of the many people who produced plays and paintings, music and books,'' T. H. Breen said here in 1997.</p>
        <p>I Left My Back Door Open  By April Sinclair. HarperPerennial, $13.</p>
        <p>Daphne Dupree is a Chicago radio host with lots to say about race, weight, self-esteem and popular music. ''It's a 'Bridget Jones's Diary' for black women,'' Sarah Vowell wrote here last year. ''Many readers will respond to this novel's honesty'' and ''colloquial humor.''</p>
        <p>Gardens in the Dunes  By Leslie Marmon Silko. Scribner, $14.</p>
        <p>Set in the 19th century, this novel follows the fate of two Native American girls who are sent from their desert home to government-run schools to become ''civilized.'' The result is ''a rich, intriguing, irritating mix of myth, allegory, Victorian children's tale and adventure yarn,'' Suzanne Ruta wrote here in 1999.</p>
