        <p>The Devils were searching for someone to regain the confidence that was seriously shaken after allowing eight goals in two consecutive losses. Instead, their confidence suffered another blow tonight as goalie Martin Brodeur was again below his usually high standards in a 3-1 loss, and Coach Larry Robinson responded with unusually harsh criticism of the Devils.</p>
        <p>Brodeur, who acknowledged having his worst game in the playoffs two nights ago in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals, allowed another soft goal tonight after several in the previous two games. This time, it was to Mark Recchi and helped the Flyers to a three-games-to-one lead in the four-of-seven-game series.</p>
        <p>By winning three in a row after losing the opening game of the series, the Flyers can eliminate the Devils in Philadelphia on Monday night.</p>
        <p>Robinson, who usually displays a calm demeanor, yelled at his players in the dressing room at Continental Arena after the game.</p>
        <p>''I don't like screaming and hollering because it hurts my voice,'' he said, ''but sometimes it's necessary when players think they don't need coaches. It's necessary until it gets through their skulls that coaches know a little more than the players do. We had a game plan and we stuck to it for the first two periods, but not in the third.''</p>
        <p>The Flyers outshot the Devils by 9-4 in the third period.</p>
        <p>While the Devils' confidence was further damaged, the Flyers' continued to rise because they are playing well and getting excellent goaltending from the rookie Brian Boucher, who made 24 saves tonight.</p>
        <p>After Bobby Holik's second-period goal matched Recchi's goal in the first, the Flyers broke the tie on Craig Berube's deflection for his first goal in the playoffs with 7 minutes 2 seconds left in the game. Berube had four goals in 77 games in the regular season, and this was his third goal in 86 career playoff games.</p>
        <p>The Flyers secured their third consecutive victory on Simon Gagne's goal with 3:20 left.</p>
        <p>''We were out of position again,'' Robinson said of the goal by Berube. ''All we had to do was top and cover the man who was wide open.''</p>
        <p>With no Devil in sight in the most dangerous area in front of Brodeur, Berube knocked down a shot from Dan McGillis past the shocked Brodeur, who described the goals by Recchi and Berube as unfortunate.</p>
        <p>Many Devils were looking for redemption for losing Game 3 on Thursday night, but none more than Brodeur, yet he never reached the level to inspire his teammates. He made a couple of brilliant saves, and 18 over all, but none were timely enough in a game of paramount importance.</p>
        <p>Brodeur did not have it two nights ago, and he did not have it in the opening period tonight, either. He was responsible for Recchi's sixth goal in the playoffs, which put the Flyers in the lead with 3:53 left in the period. Trying to clear the puck from near his goal, which has been his strength, Brodeur gave the puck to Simon Gagne in the left corner to the right of Brodeur. With Brodeur on his way back to the goal, Gagne took a shot from a sharp angle that Recchi deflected under Brodeur's right arm. Judging by Brodeur's reaction on the play, he appeared to be in disbelief.</p>
        <p>Recchi's goal stood until 12:13 into the second period, when the Flyers' Keith Primeau turned the puck over in Philadelphia's zone. Primeau's errant pass went to Sergei Brylin alone in the slot. Brylin gave it to Randy McKay, who gave it back to Brylin for a pass to Holik, who beat Boucher with a wrist shot from the slot for his second goal in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''We got away from it in the third period and it cost us,'' said Scott Stevens, the captain of the Devils. ''We've dug ourselves a hole and we'll have to climb out of it.''</p>
        <p>Holik was one of the players who took Robinson's side. ''Every player here has to do what Larry said and bring it to the next game,'' Holik said.</p>
        <p>The next game could be the last for the Devils, who are facing real adversity for the first time in these playoffs.</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>JOHN MADDEN's recovery from an injured right knee is so encouraging that the defensive specialist of the Devils may start skating as early as Monday or Tuesday. Madden said just before the start of Game 4 that he had been fitted with a new brace and he expected to play again this season, especially if the Devils advanced to the Stanley Cup finals. ''I don't know what the injury is, but the M.R.I. was better than we thought,'' Madden said. ''I'm doing strength exercises, trying to get rid of some soreness.'' . . . Coach LARRY ROBINSON, who replaced Madden with STEVE BRULE in Game 3, went with STEVE KELLY in Game 4 for the only change in the Devils' lineup. The Flyers went with the same lineup for the second game in a row.</p>
