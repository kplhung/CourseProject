        <p>To the Editor: In our young days my twin brother and I were geography buffs, just as Ralph Schoenstein and his grandson Max are in ''Genetic Mapping'' (April 9). In addition to the states puzzle that Mr. Schoenstein describes, we had a game called States and Cities, with United States geography questions. I still remember the sonority with which ''Butte, Bozeman, Billings and Missoula'' rolled off our 9-year-old tongues in answer to a question about Montana. From that game I learned of the existence of Pawtucket and Woonsocket, R.I.</p>

        <p>During travels with our parents, I read signs for such delightful burgs as Doosewallops and Humptulips, Wash. Part of the fun of geography is in the sheer joy of its language.</p>
