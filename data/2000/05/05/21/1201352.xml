        <p>When Alija Huskic and his wife, Suzana, left Bosnia in 1991, just before war erupted there, they chose Switzerland for refuge because of its reputation for good works.</p>
        <p>''We didn't know anyone there, but we knew that Geneva was the symbol of the humanitarian tradition,'' Mr. Huskic said. After moving to the city that is the base for the International Red Cross, Mr. Huskic, now 41, who had trained as a mechanical engineer, began work as a caretaker for two estates. His wife found a job as a nursery school teacher. Their daughter, Nina, went to school. They mastered French, and slipped easily into Swiss society. They looked forward to applying for Swiss citizenship in three more years.</p>
        <p>But their hopes were jolted last March, when 48 naturalization applications in a blue-collar suburb of the Swiss city of Lucerne were defeated in a popular vote. All those turned down were Turks or people from the former Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>The rejection has stirred debate across Switzerland, beginning in Emmen -- the Lucerne suburb -- which in April halted review of its 250 pending naturalization requests amid charges that its vote on the issue amounted to racist selection.</p>
        <p>The government announced it would study simplifying the process of becoming a citizen, and revived proposals to allow the children of foreigners born in Switzerland to obtain passports more easily.</p>
        <p>The Council of Europe warned that the country's system leaves ''room for discriminatory practice,'' a finding that made the Swiss bristle, particularly after the international criticism of their actions in World War II, which included turning away Jewish refugees.</p>
        <p>Swiss law gives foreigners who meet the residency requirements and have no criminal record the right to apply for Swiss nationality as long as they are integrated into Swiss society. What the Emmen vote made clear is that foreigners must virtually become more Swiss than the Swiss to stand a chance of holding a passport.</p>
        <p>As part of what some media have dubbed the ''fondue test,'' local officials usually stop by the applicant's house to check on how the family lives, the level of cleanliness and neatness, and, some say, even what they eat. ''Whether our house is clean or not does not indicate whether we are fit to be citizens,'' said Mr. Huskic, who nonetheless notes that the future of his 17-year-old daughter lies in Switzerland.</p>
        <p>Doris Diltz, a member of the Emmen legislative body, sees no problem with asking that foreigners be assimilated. ''If they want to be Swiss, it's not enough if they just try to speak the language, they must do more,'' she insisted.</p>
        <p>During the past decade, suspicion of foreigners has been aggravated by the record number of people from the Balkans who have flooded into Switzerland. Federal policy bars such asylum seekers, who are viewed as transients, from working.</p>
        <p>Resentment has been fueled by perceptions that many foreigners engage in crime, particularly drug trafficking. Over all, one in five are non-Swiss in the country of 7.2 million, which has one of Europe's highest percentages of foreigners.</p>
        <p>This explosive mix has been percolating for several years, as in other European countries, including neighboring Austria, and led last fall to soaring support for the nationalist Swiss People's Party, which campaigned on the slogan, ''Stop Asylum Abuse.''</p>
        <p>Since the Emmen vote, several villages elsewhere in Switzerland have rejected applicants for citizenship, most of them also from the Balkans. These decisions -- part of the enshrined Swiss idea that the people decide -- have rarely been contested in the past.</p>
        <p>But in March, a court struck down the refusal by the town of Pratteln in northwestern Switzerland to give citizenship to five Turks, while accepting Italians and Spaniards, on grounds it violated the Constitution's ban against discrimination. The town is considering an appeal to Switzerland's top tribunal, which would set the stage for a landmark ruling defining once and for all what is required to be a Swiss citizen.</p>
        <p>Swiss human rights groups, meanwhile, have banded together to push for laws giving asylum seekers full social and economic rights, and to get the employment ban on them repealed.</p>
        <p>In Geneva, officials even offered citizenship to the 48 people rejected by Emmen, an impractical offer since they live in a different city and speak German rather than French.</p>
        <p>''If we require everyone to be assimilated, we are creating a country where everyone has the same ideas about our problems,'' said Jean-Marc Froidevaux, one of the Geneva politicians who made the offer. ''This is not going to help Switzerland get ahead.''</p>
