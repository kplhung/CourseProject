        <p>For the last 10 years, in all sorts of weather, Elaine Briggs has stood on the corner of Seventh Avenue South and West Fourth Street, singing the dozens of jazz and blues songs that she has written about the neighborhood. During her time on that corner, she has witnessed countless scenes that she has written into songs.</p>
        <p>Once, eight years ago, Ms. Briggs said, a man set a paper shopping bag on a window ledge next to her, then quickly ran away. Ms. Briggs said that when she looked in the bag she found half a human head. She said she fainted at the sight, but later wrote a song about the incident called ''Oh, Lordy.''</p>

        <p>For the last 10 years, in all sorts of weather, Elaine Briggs has stood on the corner of Seventh Avenue South and West Fourth Street, singing the dozens of jazz and blues songs that she has written about the neighborhood. During her time on that corner, she has witnessed countless scenes that she has written into songs.</p>
        <p>Once, eight years ago, Ms. Briggs said, a man set a paper shopping bag on a window ledge next to her, then quickly ran away. Ms. Briggs said that when she looked in the bag she found half a human head. She said she fainted at the sight, but later wrote a song about the incident called ''Oh, Lordy.''</p>
        <p>''This corner is extremely important to me, because it not only gives me a sense of home, but an extended family,'' Ms. Briggs said on a recent overcast afternoon.</p>
        <p>Ms. Briggs and her husband, an air-conditioner operator and musician, wrote hundreds of love songs, many telling sad tales. When her husband died of kidney failure in 1986, Ms. Briggs worked to support her two sons through high school. After the second graduated in 1989, she moved out of her Queens apartment and began living on the streets of the West Village.</p>
        <p>Since then, she has become a fixture, recognized by local residents and celebrating many of their lives in song. One, ''You Liked Me When I  Needed You the Most,'' tells of a woman who sometimes cried on her boyfriend's shoulder at the corner of Grove Street and Seventh Avenue South, confessing that she felt loved only when she was vulnerable. Another, ''For Your Precious Love,'' describes a man who faithfully stood on Christopher Street at Seventh Avenue waiting in vain for a chance to declare his love for a young woman who lived nearby.</p>
        <p>To supplement the tips she earns singing -- from $10 to $50 or $60 a day, she says -- Ms. Briggs salvages flowers thrown out by local florists and sells arrangements for about $8 each.</p>
        <p>On a recent warm afternoon, a man stopped as Ms. Briggs sang a song called ''The Mockingbird,'' about a wispy little bird that sang while hopping from tree to tree. He listened for a moment, then bought a bouquet before leaving.</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, a woman paused. Ms. Briggs finished ''The Mockingbird'' with a flourish and a bow. The woman clapped. ''Almost ever day, I go out of my way to hear you sing about this corner,'' she said.  ''What a pleasure.''</p>
