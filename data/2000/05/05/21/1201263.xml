        <p>IN the Old Navy commercials shown during the Academy Awards in March, a new spokeswoman was promoting the cheap, cheerful clothing line: Lisa Ling, 26, co-host of ''The View'' on ABC. Ms. Ling, wearing red capris and a white T-shirt, said cheekily, ''A good pair of shorts is hard to find, unless you know where to look.'' Behind her, a group of hunky young men sprinted by in cargo shorts.</p>
        <p>I was amazed. Not at the sexual innuendo but at the sight of a young Chinese-American woman representing an enormous clothing company, on national television, on Oscar night -- the ultimate convergence of celebrity, glamour and fashion.

        <p>IN the Old Navy commercials shown during the Academy Awards in March, a new spokeswoman was promoting the cheap, cheerful clothing line: Lisa Ling, 26, co-host of ''The View'' on ABC. Ms. Ling, wearing red capris and a white T-shirt, said cheekily, ''A good pair of shorts is hard to find, unless you know where to look.'' Behind her, a group of hunky young men sprinted by in cargo shorts.</p>
        <p>I was amazed. Not at the sexual innuendo but at the sight of a young Chinese-American woman representing an enormous clothing company, on national television, on Oscar night -- the ultimate convergence of celebrity, glamour and fashion. Suddenly, Ms. Ling, with her crisp looks and newscaster-like delivery, was a style icon.</p>
        <p>That might not sound like a big deal today, but I remember seeing a very different Ling (played by Tsai Chin) on television as a kid in the 1970's. My sisters and I were in our family room watching a rerun of the 1967 James Bond movie, ''You Only Live Twice.'' One of the first scenes takes place in Hong Kong, or more precisely, in a bed in Hong Kong, where Agent 007 kisses a long-haired Chinese woman with blunt bangs.</p>
        <p>''Why is it that Chinese girls taste different from all other girls?'' he asks her.</p>
        <p>''You think Chinese girls bet-tuh, huh?'' she replies.</p>
        <p>''Not better, just different -- the way Peking duck is different from Russian caviar, but I love them both,'' Bond says.</p>
        <p>''Dah-ling, I give you very best duck,'' Ling says.</p>
        <p>Then she jumps out of bed right before two men with machine guns burst in and try to riddle Bond with bullets.</p>
        <p>Bond's Ling was the amalgam of almost every Chinese female stereotype: a submissive sex nymph speaking in breathy, broken English, and a calculating dragon lady. (If she'd leapt out of bed and into a lab coat and thick glasses, the cliche would have been complete.) She is also the only representation of Asian women in film or television that I remember from my childhood -- aside from the ''ancient Chinese secret'' laundry lady in the Calgon commercials. At the time, I didn't know enough to be angry or offended. I was just embarrassed.</p>
        <p>But lately there has been an Asian population explosion in the pop culture landscape.  In Hollywood, there's a new kind of A-list that includes Asian It Girls like Ming-Wa, Bai Ling, Michelle Yeoh and Lucy Liu. Beaming from a billboard in Times Square is CoCo Lee, the Hong Kong-born, San Francisco-reared singer whose first United States album, ''Just No Other Way,'' was released two months ago.</p>
        <p>There has also been an Asian style invasion: Vera Wang, the fashion designer, on the cover of Town &amp; Country this winter, Ahn Duong, the artist, on the cover of Banana Republic's new catalog just last week. Fashion models like Devon Aoki and Ling are fixtures on the runways. Asian faces are even infiltrating society pages. The actress China Chow and the Visionaire editor Cecilia Dean are downtown scenesters who appear regularly in Vogue's party pictures. W magazine's May issue alone features a profile of Wendy Deng discussing the Asia Society and marriage to Rupert Murdoch, a story about Hong Kong-born Grace Leo Andrieu, owner of the celebrity-studded Hotel Lancaster in London, as well as a 12-page swimsuit portfolio starring Ms. Aoki.</p>
        <p>But if Asian women are busting out of the China doll stereotypes, their new image does tend to borrow some of the old cliches. They may no longer be mousy math whizzes, but they're still brainy. Clawed dragon ladies might be out, but style queens with sharp tongues and sharp wardrobes are very in. ''We're never portrayed as bimbos,'' said the Malaysian-born designer Yeohlee. ''It's because of our flat chests.''</p>
        <p>That does not mean they aren't physical. On screen, Asian women often combine sexiness and action heroism with unusual ease, like Michelle Yeoh, the actress whose long, glossy hair flies as she leaps tall buildings in the Jackie Chan movies. Lucy Liu, the acerbic Ling Woo on ''Ally McBeal,'' will be a kickboxing cop in the film version of ''Charlie's Angels'' in November alongside Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz. (It's somehow harder to imagine the neurotic Calista Flockhart chasing bad guys with a gun.)</p>
        <p>Despite such new, cool roles, the effort to create a hip identity that can include Asian-ness rather than try to hide it is still pretty new and often self-conscious. When I met Lisa Ling at an event for Nutrisse home hair-coloring products two months ago, she said: ''What I try to convey to other Asians with my sense of style is that we can defy the stereotypes that we are submissive and not gregarious. We don't have to conform. I can be obnoxious and blunt.'' As if to prove her point, Ms. Ling added, ''So many Asians are label whores. Have you noticed that?''</p>
        <p>But even Ms. Ling's bravado set in only a few years ago. ''I hated being Chinese as a kid!'' recalled Ms. Ling, who was born in California. ''I was teased mercilessly. I went to public school, and the kids called me 'Risa Ring.' Kids would come over to my house, and it would smell like Chinese food, and that was embarrassing. Or if I had friends over, my dad would say, 'Tell them to go home' in Chinese, right in front of them.''</p>
        <p>I nodded vigorously in agreement, remembering the time a classmate of my younger sister's came over after school, smelled rice cooking and asked if we had pet gerbils. My sister explained the odor by saying that our heating system was broken.</p>
        <p>It wasn't always clear, growing up in Albuquerque, how to bridge the divide between my Chinese heritage and my desire to fit in with the tall, tanned set at the tennis club. My parents, a scientist and a classical pianist, spoke Cantonese to each other, and to us, when we were small. In our house, high style was my grandmother wearing a cheongsam and singing Chinese opera as we kids padded around the house in our embroidered Chinese pajamas with frog buttons.</p>
        <p>But away from home, being Asian could be nerve-racking. My white and Hispanic classmates flattened their noses with their fingers to mock my wide features. When we had to line up by height, I was always shortest and last. My beauty ideals were the blond models in Seventeen and in the ads for Ocean Pacific, the Southern California clothing company. When Madonna hit the charts, I wore crucifixes, black lace gloves and rubber bracelets up to my elbows. My New Wave phase followed: head shaved on the sides, dyed orange hair forced skyward with gel and diluted glue.</p>
        <p>If only I had had a role model like Margaret Yang, the quirky high school girl in last year's film ''Rushmore'' who played rock guitar, acted in avant-garde school plays and got the boy in the end. Why the sudden embrace of Asian women and culture?</p>
        <p>The designer Vivienne Tam, who was raised in Hong Kong (and whose style guide ''China Chic'' will be published in September by ReganBooks), links it to the new global economy and the opening up of Asia. ''When Hong Kong went back to China in 1997, I think there was more awareness around the world of Asian culture,'' she said on the phone from her Seventh Avenue office. ''And then Prada and Miu Miu started the whole chinoiserie trend.''</p>
        <p>Phoebe Eng, the author of ''Warrior Lessons: An Asian American Woman's Journey Into Power'' (Pocket Books), said it's not the rest of the world but Asian women themselves who have changed. ''We are the crop of daughters who finally had choices,'' Ms. Eng, 37, said. ''We didn't have the same sense of duty and boundness of our mothers, so we took our own paths and went into acting, comedy and entertainment. The number of Asian women entering F.I.T. and Parsons is amazing.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Eng also pointed out that Asians are not only fashion forward, but also have an ethnicity that is integral to their style. ''You see lots of 15-year-olds wearing Hello Kitty and chinoiserie,'' she said. ''And older Asian women have an androgynous look, and that is what makes the look sensuous. We used to think of Asian models as chiseled and Eurasian-looking. Now, some have very small eyes, and others have square jaws. Anything goes.''</p>
        <p>It didn't occur to me that my ethnic looks could be a style advantage when I took my first job after college, as an editorial assistant at a beauty magazine. Once again I was surrounded by lithe blondes, now with expensive haircuts and dressed in black. But it turned out to be a propitious time. One of my first writing assignments was a story about ''universal beauty'' and featured Irina Pantaeva, a Siberian model with northern Chinese features. Doling out advice on how to beautify the flat lids and sparse lashes of an Asian eye, I began to feel more in control of my looks and less concerned about fitting in.</p>
        <p>Then something unexpected happened. I found myself part of an Asian style clique, a bunch of trend-happy editors and writers who introduced me not only to sample sales, but also to the soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown. We often meet there after work, shove our Lambertson Truex totes under our chairs and order (mostly in Mandarin) greasy noodles and ''lion's head,'' giant, gelatinous meatballs drenched in brown sauce and surrounded by a mane of greens, which we share, pecking at the communal platters with our chopsticks. In between bites of noodles and media gossip, I can rant freely about my family and my boyfriend, then gloat over the three $25 string bikinis I just bought from Old Navy, the store Lisa Ling represents on television.</p>
