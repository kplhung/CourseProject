        <p>Susan Vaughn, who has been chairwoman of the community board that covers the Lower East Side since 1996, has not been reappointed to her post. Margarita Lopez, a local councilwoman, had strongly recommended the action, citing differences over land-use issues.</p>
        <p>Ms. Vaughn, a librarian at Brooklyn College and a longtime East Village resident, learned of the decision last month from the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields.</p>
        <p>Although it is fairly unusual for a board chairwoman or chairman to be ousted, Community Board 3 has been roiled by dissent and disarray for years. The issue of how to use city-owned properties has been especially charged. In 1996, a man protesting the development of community gardens on East Ninth Street threw a cream-filled cake at Ms. Vaughn's predecessor, Albert Fabozzi. The previous year, squatters set off stink bombs during a meeting of the board's housing committee.</p>
        <p>In outlining her differences with Ms. Vaughn, Ms. Lopez spoke specifically of the Esperanza Community Garden on East Seventh Street. In February the city razed the garden to make way for a complex of apartments and stores. Hundreds of demonstrators occupied the garden the morning it was destroyed, 31 people were arrested and the planned apartments were attacked on the grounds that only 20 percent of them were designated for low- and middle-income tenants.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Lopez described the situation, she opposed the development while Ms. Vaughn supported it. ''Our differences were beyond reconciliation,'' Ms. Lopez said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Vaughn, who was appointed as chairwoman by Antonio Pagan, Ms. Lopez's predecessor, and reappointed by Ms. Lopez in 1998, disputes this version of events.</p>
        <p>''It's true I voted for the development plan,'' she said. ''But it did not include bulldozing Esperanza.'' The board had originally approved a plan to spare the garden, but the plan was changed to permit its destruction.</p>
        <p>Harry Kresky, a lawyer who represented some community members who tried to delay the bulldozing, contends that Ms. Lopez backed the plan to bulldoze the garden.</p>
        <p>''When people like Hillary Clinton and Judith Hope were criticizing the bulldozing, Margarita Lopez was nowhere to be found,'' he said. ''If she cared about preserving the garden, why didn't she speak up publicly?''</p>
        <p>Board members will elect a new leader next month. Whatever the outcome, some members say they will miss Ms. Vaughn.</p>
        <p>''People on the board are very upset,'' said one member, who asked to be anonymous. ''Susan Vaughn was extremely hardworking. She had brains and heart, and it's not easy to find someone like that.''</p>
