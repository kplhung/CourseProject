        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>If one considers Winston Churchill's thoughts on the purpose of universities, the ''Toadies,'' faculty, students and the rest of the nation might well be shocked. Churchill so wisely wrote: ''The first duty of a university is to teach wisdom not trade, character not technicalities. Young people study at universities to achieve knowledge, not to learn a trade. We must learn to support ourselves, but we must also learn how to live.''</p>

        <p>With the given trend in present-day American university education and now the decision by president of Indiana University to allow Bob Knight to continue after his appalling gyrations as a university coach, only edges toward the conviction that American universities are becoming trade schools with professional sports teams. Hardly what Churchill might have recommended. Pity!</p>
