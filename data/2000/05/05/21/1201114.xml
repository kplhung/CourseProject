        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>The young couple browsing at the garage sale seemed taken with a cut-glass vase. The man admired its graceful lines and delicate pattern; the woman said she had seen it for three times the price at Fortunoff's.</p>

        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>The young couple browsing at the garage sale seemed taken with a cut-glass vase. The man admired its graceful lines and delicate pattern; the woman said she had seen it for three times the price at Fortunoff's.</p>
        <p>''We'll put it on the coffee table,'' he said.</p>
        <p>So they carelessly left it unguarded while they examined an ice bucket. Immediately, the customer to their right snatched up the vase, paid the homeowner and left.</p>
        <p>''O.K., Mom,'' the young woman asked. ''What do you want us to sell next?''</p>
        <p>BATHROOM HUMOR</p>
        <p>A most peculiar guy</p>
        <p>In the adjacent stall:</p>
        <p>''I love you, too. Goodbye'''</p>
        <p>Concludes his cellphone call.</p>
        <p>Now, doesn't it deflate your</p>
        <p>Idea of the romantic</p>
        <p>That even calls of nature</p>
        <p>Require Bell Atlantic?</p>
        <p>BOB McKENTY</p>
        <p>At a recent concert of the Princeton Chamber Symphony in Richardson Auditorium I was seated behind a family of six, including the infant.</p>
        <p>A voice a few rows behind me tsk-tsked in disapproval: ''A baby! At a concert!''</p>
        <p>When the appearance of the conductor, Mark Laycock, brought a thunder of applause, the baby decided to add her own special sounds.</p>
        <p>From behind me came the voice triumphantly, ''Bye bye,'' as the father whisked away the infant.</p>
        <p>One of the orchestral selections was Arvo Part's Symphony No. 2, a work devoid of whistleable tunes.</p>
        <p>At that point, the voice a few rows back again reacted with disapproval. ''Bring back the baby,'' he said.</p>
        <p>MARY ELIZABETH HARTZ</p>
        <p>My mother bought us the board game ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and we were playing it on Mother's Day.</p>
        <p>When it was my daughter's turn to be the host, she started putting question cards back in the wrong stacks. Naturally, I corrected her.</p>
        <p>''Mom,'' she said with a groan, ''do you think Regis's mother does that?''</p>
        <p>DEBRA GALANT</p>
        <p>Overheard at a restaurant in West Orange on Mother's Day was this exchange between a father and his 4-year-old daughter:</p>
        <p>Father: ''Do you know whose special day this is?''</p>
        <p>Daughter: ''It's Mommy and Daddy's special day.''</p>
        <p>Father: ''Why is that?''</p>
        <p>Daughter: ''Mommy's because she doesn't have to cook, and Daddy's because he doesn't have to eat Mommy's cooking.''</p>
        <p>MARILYN VASEN</p>
        <p>ATTRACTED TO THE LIGHT (VERSE)</p>
        <p>M is for the million times you bugged me</p>
        <p>O is for the one time you did better</p>
        <p>T is for the times you sometimes mugged me</p>
        <p>H is for the hole in my new sweater.</p>
        <p>Put them all together they spell Moth</p>
        <p>My little revered insect of the cloth.</p>
        <p>EDMUND CONTI</p>
        <p>When I visited the play area at Burke's Park in Parlin last winter, with my three grandchildren, 2-year-old Elizabeth slipped on the icy sand and landed on her backside.</p>
        <p>Recently, on our first visit to the park since that slip, Elizabeth exclaimed, ''Where did the ice go?''</p>
