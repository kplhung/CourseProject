        <p>After a decade as an actor, Liz Zazzi is probably best known for her role as the pregnant maid of honor in the long-running Off Broadway play  ''Tony 'n' Tina's Wedding.''

        <p>After a decade as an actor, Liz Zazzi is probably best known for her role as the pregnant maid of honor in the long-running Off Broadway play  ''Tony 'n' Tina's Wedding.'' But like many actors, her bread and butter comes from television spots. She has played what she calls a ''very tacky Italian bride'' to sell Alka-Seltzer, for example, and a receptionist with a squeaky voice to promote the History Channel.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zazzi, who is in her 30's and lives in Glen Ridge, N.J., describes herself as a ''typical working-class actor.'' But she is more successful than most, sometimes landing three jobs in a week, although her usual ratio is one role in 10 to 20 auditions. In a good year, she said, she may earn close to $100,000. Other years, her income may drop to $30,000.</p>
        <p>These days, Ms. Zazzi is rising before dawn to join other striking actors on picket lines in the hope of preventing producers from making commercials with nonunion actors. She is one of 135,000 members of the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists who went on strike against the advertising industry on May 1.</p>
        <p>The strike is making itself felt in New York, the nation's advertising capital. About one-third of all national advertising is produced in New York, and the metropolitan region is home to about 55,000 members of the unions, many of whom make their living primarily by acting in commercials or doing voice-overs.</p>
        <p>Some producers say the three-week-old strike has made their work more difficult but has not stopped them, in part because they had months to prepare for it. David Perry, the director of broadcast production for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, said industry officials began stockpiling names and photos of nonunion actors six months ago. Other companies are making their commercials overseas, said Matt Miller, president of the Association of Independent Commercial Producers.</p>
        <p>''We have not canceled a single shoot because of this problem,'' Mr. Perry said. Instead, he and other producers have avoided locations in mid-Manhattan and hired extra security guards. They have obtained as many as six city permits in different places for a single shoot in an effort to keep the union guessing.</p>
        <p>Union members, however, say they have disrupted a number of projects, including one in Montclair, N.J., for General Electric, and another in Brooklyn for A.I.G. Insurance. On Thursday, striking actors tried to drown out an Old Spice commercial being filmed in a Washington Heights building by banging on pots and pans in the apartment next door, said Steven Mark Friedman, a strike captain.</p>
        <p>The central issue in the strike is how to pay actors for their work in commercials. Negotiators for the advertising industry say they want to eliminate rules from television's infancy, when only a few channels existed.</p>
        <p>Under the current system, most actors get a session fee of $475 a day for their work on the set and a residual each time the spot is shown on network television. That can be lucrative. Ms. Zazzi said she was once paid nearly $30,000 in residuals for one commercial for Vivarin, an over-the-counter stimulant. But the industry wants to replace residuals with a one-time fee for unlimited use during a 13-week period, the same method used for cable television.</p>
        <p>The actors, however, say that the system proposed by the industry would destroy their livelihood because the fees -- about $2,575 for 13 weeks of network use and $1,627 for a similar period on cable -- would not make up for the long stretches they go without work and for their unreimbursed expenses, like photographs and transportation to auditions. As it is, the actors say, and the industry confirms, their aggregate pay of about $720 million a year amounts to only about 2 percent of what is spent on producing and showing the spots.</p>
        <p>The actors also say they are losing income because the industry does not monitor how often a commercial is shown and does not apply the labor contracts to the Internet.</p>
        <p>But John A. McGuinn, the chief negotiator for the advertising industry, said the unions should police their own contracts and advertising on the Internet was so new that further study was needed to determine how to pay actors for it.</p>
        <p>The strike is not expected to end soon. Discussions are being held with mediators, but no negotiating sessions have been scheduled. Both sides say time is on their side, the industry because the actors are going without paychecks and the actors because they think advertisers will be unhappy with the quality of the commercials made with nonunion labor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perry, however, said the strike had hurt only ''a very small percentage'' of his agency's commercials.  ''A lot of what we call acting is not terribly difficult,'' he said. ''You don't go to the Old Vic to learn how to hold a can of Spray 'n Wash.''</p>
        <p>Advertisers are mistaken, Ms. Zazzi said, if they think she is easily replaceable. ''I have to tell an entire story sometimes in 15 seconds,'' she said. ''And while you're doing it, you've got to sell the product.''</p>
