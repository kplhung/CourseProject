        <p>IS there a nice place to eat here?'' I asked the Delta counter agent at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport one afternoon last month. ''Next door,'' responded the agent, Linda Cartisano. ''Behind the Continental counter.''</p>
        <p>''Wolfgang Puck?'' I said hopefully. ''Oh, don't I wish,'' Ms. Cartisano said. ''Listen, even a Starbucks would make out like a bandit in this place. At 6 o'clock, everything begins to shut down and there are still flights going out until 9:30. It's really too bad.''</p>

        <p>IS there a nice place to eat here?'' I asked the Delta counter agent at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport one afternoon last month. ''Next door,'' responded the agent, Linda Cartisano. ''Behind the Continental counter.''</p>
        <p>''Wolfgang Puck?'' I said hopefully. ''Oh, don't I wish,'' Ms. Cartisano said. ''Listen, even a Starbucks would make out like a bandit in this place. At 6 o'clock, everything begins to shut down and there are still flights going out until 9:30. It's really too bad.''</p>
        <p>And really too bad is roughly what most people think of long waits at airports. But as a Port Authority official in New York pointed out, because passengers now must arrive an hour or more ahead of their departures, some companies see captive customers for better wares and are moving in. This trend is fueled by huge expansions at airports.</p>
        <p>So after telling Ms. Cartisano to hang on because Wolfgang Puck was now franchising airport restaurants, I walked around the corner to Fort Lauderdale's Terminal 3 restaurant. I instantly understood her regretful tone. It proved to be the usual: a disappointing steam table and a salad bar festooned with iceberg lettuce and thick dressings.</p>
        <p>I had been keeping a list of innovations at American airports that make time there more bearable, and had gone to Fort Lauderdale as a scout. The most recent changes were at a rental car station, completing a tally of seven signs that comfort and air travel aren't always clashing concepts -- at least on the ground.</p>
        <p>A Different Clientele</p>
        <p>The Alamo center is five minutes by jitney from the terminals. A spokeswoman, Cheryl Budd, said that 75 percent of Alamo's average of 15,000 daily customers in Fort Lauderdale were leisure travelers and that the company had concluded that formulas for business renters did not fit their needs.</p>
        <p>Alamo, which has headquarters in the city, called in researchers two years ago, who saw that families were unstrapping luggage on the floor and changing from winter wardrobes to shorts and T-shirts and back again right there. When the rental cars wheeled away, they headed for a convenience store, for snacks and soft drinks.</p>
        <p>The rental plaza was enlarged and remodeled. Seats and benches were added, along with a play area and a canteen with a refrigerator, tables and chairs. Prices for sodas and coffee were matched to off-airport prices, with a regular coffee at $1.05 and a soft drink $1. Four cubicles with benches are being installed for those who want to change.</p>
        <p>Using this model, Alamo (www.  alamo.com) plans to revamp locations in Orlando, Tampa, Denver, Las Vegas and Los Angeles by the end of the year. Other locations will incorporate certain features.</p>
        <p>A la Puck</p>
        <p>Wolfgang Puck's advent as an airport eating place deserves a spot even on a short list. A colleague and her family ate at a branch at O'Hare in Chicago, and while it was not Spago itself, she said she was pleased with the wood-oven pizza and the attentive service.</p>
        <p>Tom Warner, senior vice president of the Wolfgang Puck Food Company in Santa Monica, Calif., said the company had franchised two units at O'Hare to Host-Marriott, one at Denver to a private operator, and two at Los Angeles International to CA One Services.</p>
        <p>Mr. Warner said that Puck frozen foods were not used at airports, but that specialists were sent in to train employees and they sometimes dropped by later to check quality.</p>
        <p>Laptop Lane got on the list when a friend reported last August that under the motto ''peace, quiet and a T-1 line,'' she had found a place at Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta to gather her scattered thoughts and e-mail messages. These offices-by-the-minute are now in 12 airports, with two more due this month.</p>
        <p>The centers, with concierges at the entrance, are carved into cubicles  with a locking door, counter, personal computer and modem or T-1 line hookup. I later tried one and found it no more depressing than most offices. But after searching through three terminals in Fort Lauderdale for a place to plug in both a laptop and its modem line, I would have paid lots more than the company's rate for any place, however small, to sit down and plug in.</p>
        <p>The rates include long-distance phone service in the United States, the ability to send and receive faxes and the use of a plain-paper printer. The first five minutes cost $2 and each additional minute 38 cents. The centers are open daily, for as long as 16 hours in some places.</p>
        <p>Laptop Lanes are at O'Hare; Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky; Denver International; Hartsfield-Atlanta; Seattle-Tacoma; Dallas-Fort Worth; Detroit; La Guardia in New York; Philadephia; Phoenix Sky Harbor; Tampa and Raleigh. Information: (425) 653-2000; www.laptoplane.com.</p>
        <p>Probably the most exasperating part of waiting around an airport alone in the days of high security is having to haul carry-on luggage every place, even into a bathroom. So, the resurgence of the locker gets a place on the list.</p>
        <p>Since 1992, Smarte Carte, a St. Paul company with luggage-cart concesssions, has created banks of lockers in 35 domestic airports that use punch-in codes rather than keys. The unique code is printed on the receipt.</p>
        <p>The lockers are big enough for several suitcases, and the installation includes a change-making machine. In Fort Lauderdale, the initial fee was $1, which provides half an hour of storage; to retrieve, one pays $1 for each additional half-hour, up to $6 for 24 hours.</p>
        <p>Dealing With Security</p>
        <p>The security concerns that led the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to rip out storage lockers after a bomb at La Guardia killed 11 people in 1975 still exist. Smarte Carte says its electronic controls permit the company to pop open all the doors at once, and also permit emptying on a daily basis.</p>
        <p>At New York's airports, there are still no lockers. There are baggage storage areas at each, and Bill Cahill, a spokesman for the Port Authority, says that the clerks may ask to look into bags before they are checked. These facilities close at 9, 10 or 11 p.m., depending on the site. The fees range up to $15 a day. At Kennedy, they are in Terminals 1, 4E and 4W; at Newark, in Terminal B; at La Guardia, at the US Airways and Delta terminals.</p>
        <p>The advent of a top-drawer hotel right in an airport where people connect for overseas flights is good news, and Hilton opened one at Logan International in Boston in September. The 10-story, 600-room hotel  has a big restaurant, a major plus since Logan is dug up and travel into the city is impeded by the Big Dig.</p>
        <p>Rates are $159 to $299 a night for a standard room. The hotel has moving walkways into Terminals A and E. Hilton Boston Logan, Boston, Mass. 02128; (617) 569-9300.</p>
        <p>The new Hilton at Logan opens some facilities to people who are not guests: for $9 a day, a weary traveler can use a shower; for $15, anyone can use the workout equipment, pool and whirlpool, as well as showers.</p>
        <p>A company called 24 Hour Fitness in Pleasanton, Calif., a major operator west of the Mississippi, opened essentially a full gym at McCarran Airport in Las Vegas in February. If you packed workout clothes in your carry-on, $15 will buy you a day's admission and a towel. If not, $30 buys you access, shorts, shirt, socks and a towel and rental of shoes. There is a steam room and sauna, as well as locker rooms. The club is open 24 hours a day; (702) 261-3971; www.24hourfitness.com.</p>
        <p>In Pittsburgh, a company called Airport Fitness has opened a health club next to the international arrivals area. The gym has treadmills, stationary bikes, weights and other equipment. It is open 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. weekdays, until 8 p.m. on Saturday and 8 a.m to 10 p.m. on Sunday. The visitor pays $9.99 for entry and a towel, or $14.99 for admission and to rent an outfit. It costs $7.50 for sauna and locker room use only; (412) 472-5231; www.airportfitness.com.</p>
        <p>At Miami International, the fitness center is on the eighth floor of the Miami International Airport Hotel at Concourse E. It has a 40-foot outdoor pool, a small gym, sauna, steam room, shower and whirlpool. The lockers have keys. A day pass costs $8 and includes a towel. Open 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily; (305) 871-4100.</p>
        <p>At Los Angeles International, 24 Hour Fitness operates a health club with a sauna in the lower lobby of the Hilton. Hotel guests can use it for $6 a day; others pay $10, plus $7 for a shower towel. Gym clothes, except for shoes, are for sale. The club is open 24 hours a day; (310) 410-9909; www.24hourfitness.com.</p>
        <p>At O'Hare, there is also a club in the Hilton, across from Terminal 2. It has a sauna, steam room, pool, whirlpool and workout room. The $9 fee provides a towel and locker key. Clothes, but not shoes, can be bought. Open 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. Monday to Thursday; to 10 p.m. Friday, and from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday and Sunday; (773) 601-1722.</p>
        <p>For the Kids</p>
        <p>Places that really engage younger children are rare at airports. O'Hare has a really classy area, Kids on the Fly, with Legos, coloring books, a pretend control tower and places for adults to sit, in Terminal 2. The Chicago Children's Museum created it in 1996.</p>
