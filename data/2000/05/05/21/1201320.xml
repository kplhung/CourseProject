        <p>WHEN the House of Representatives this week tackles the issue of liberalizing trade ties with China, the voice of American business will be heard loud and clear.</p>
        <p>Not since Newt Gingrich tried unsuccessfully in 1995 and 1996 to make liability laws more favorable to corporations have so many types of American companies banded together to lobby for a single issue, according to Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce. From agricultural processors to Internet businesses, and from automakers to movie studios, corporate America sees profits in China.</p>
        <p>In the lobbying effort, the bigger fish are leaning hard on the smaller ones. Companies that sell everything from cleaning supplies to titanium to Boeing -- even hot dogs to its employees -- may not seem like exporters. But with Boeing increasingly reliant on overseas aircraft sales, and convinced that China will become the world's fastest-growing aircraft market, the company has enlisted its parts makers to badger members of Congress.</p>
        <p>The effort could be potent, for there is a supplier in nearly every pot. Boeing's 10,000 suppliers are spread across 420 of the nation's 435 Congressional districts -- a distribution that rivals that of even the most politically durable military program -- and Boeing has contacted them all.</p>
        <p>''Every one of those suppliers is an exporter and should understand the importance of China, and we think they do,'' said Philip M. Condit, Boeing's chairman and chief executive, who has made 10 trips to Washington this year. ''You're just running an all-out campaign.''</p>
        <p>Trying to counter the corporate effort, unions and environmental and other advocacy groups have organized demonstrations, started letter-writing campaigns and sent supporters to Washington by the busload. But American business has responded with its own mobilization, using connections to lawmakers forged over years of nickel-and-dime lobbying.</p>
        <p>The pact has wide corporate support because it would require China to lower tariffs, end restrictive business rules and dismantle many other trade barriers. The United States, in turn, would halt its annual Congressional reviews of China's access to the American market. Those reviews have often focused on human rights and have made some American companies leery of long-term investments.</p>
        <p>Farmers and equipment makers want lower tariffs on American grain. Insurers, banks and brokerage houses want to eliminate licensing requirements that turn any hope of entry into China into a multiyear marathon of wining and dining government officials.</p>
        <p>Automakers want an end to China's requirement that 80 percent of the parts in any car built there be made in China. Retailers are eager to import far more low-priced clothing from China. Hollywood, drug makers and high-technology businesses want improved protections against the illegal copying of movies, medicines and software.</p>
        <p>''In terms of government regulation and intervention, we'd like it to be the minimum necessary,'' said Robert M. Kimmitt, vice chairman and president of Commerce One in Pleasanton, Calif., which has already set up business-to-business Internet exchanges in the United States and is  trying to do so in China, too.</p>
        <p>The normalization of trade would bring all this and more as China seeks to integrate its economy more closely with the global market by joining the World Trade Organization. Membership in the W.T.O. would require Beijing to comply with extraordinarily detailed free-trade rules, which extend far beyond tariffs and duties to cover most everything from intellectual property rights to the freedom granted to companies to set up their own distribution networks. Proponents say full entry into the world market will make China more prosperous, more open and less prone to abusing human rights.</p>
        <p>''We tend to favor free trade and we also think that if we really do want to progress in human rights within China, one of the ways to do that is to actually open up trade,'' said Jacques Nasser, the chief executive of the Ford Motor Company.</p>
        <p>American labor leaders and their allies reject the executives' reasoning. The United States, they say, would lose its ability to influence human rights in China, particularly because the bill would eliminate the annual votes in Congress on trade ties -- votes that have sometimes prompted China to ease policies.</p>
        <p>Still fuming over the North American Free Trade Agreement, which they blame for a loss of jobs to Mexico, union presidents are even more fearful of free trade with the world's largest low-wage country. Stephen Yokich, president of the United Automobile Workers, said Congressional approval would ''give American corporations an incentive again to ship jobs, this time to China, which is even cheaper.''</p>
        <p>But while unions worry about losing jobs, American companies fret about losing markets. ''We have the potential of a 100-fold increase in travel per person in a country of 1.2 billion people, and that's a huge market,'' Mr. Condit said.</p>
        <p>The trade deal, he contended, poses a question from China to America: ''Is the U.S. a reliable trade partner and can we buy airplanes from Boeing, or is it not a reliable trade partner and do we look to Europe?''</p>
        <p>Following are closer looks by reporters for The New York Times at how various industries would be affected by a new China trade agreement.</p>
