        <p>LINDA GRANT, a school board member, calls the dispute over a proposal to put up lights at the high school football field here ''a tinder box that could go up at any time.''</p>
        <p>On one side are residents offering to donate $125,000 to pay for the lights and also to provide additional funds to cover necessary operating costs. They want the lights so that teams can play at night, and they argue that it will let parents share more after-work time with their children.</p>
        <p>''The lights will bring us together,''</p>
        <p>said Sandra Zwerger, a member of the group that favors the lights.</p>
        <p>On the other side are members of the Rye Natural Light Association, who don't want lighting poles as tall as 15 feet rearing up from a quaint part of the city, across the street from the church where George and Barbara Bush married. They fear the lights will mar the view and lower property values.</p>
        <p>The controversy has proved extremely divisive, said Ms. Grant, chairman of a Board of Education advisory committee that was appointed over the winter to study the issue.</p>
        <p>At meetings, the opposing sides sit on separate sides of the aisle, like feuding factions at a family wedding. ''It's upstaging everything,'' Ms. Grant said, ''even the budget.''</p>
        <p>The pro-light group argues that the night illumination would not add to the taxpayers' burden.</p>
        <p>Also, the lights would be turned on only seven times a year and would be lowered on their poles when not in use, said John Eyler, the president of Toys 'R' Us and a member of the pro-lights group. ''After we rented lights for $5,000 for one night game,'' he said, ''we thought about how it would be a great idea to raise money to install permanent lights so we could hold more events.''</p>
        <p>But the opponents have other concerns.</p>
        <p>''The proposed industrial-style lights are completely out of character with the high school architecture and historic and pristine nature of this neighborhood,'' the group that is opposing the lights said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Or as Drew Shea, a banker and the president of the Rye Natural Light Association, said, ''Large lights will attract crowds and create a celebratory atmosphere in people's backyards.''</p>
        <p>The opponents see the gift as benefiting only the high school's athletes, while the school district has more important issues to consider.</p>
        <p>''This gift looks a little frivolous to many people,'' Ms. Grant said.  ''What kind of a statement is it making when maybe it would be more important to create another first grade to maintain our pupil-teacher ratios.''</p>
        <p>Cathleen Morgan, the chairwoman of the Board of Education, called it ''a very very controversial issue and one that people are very passionate about.''</p>
        <p>The board will vote on May 31  whether to accept the gift.</p>
