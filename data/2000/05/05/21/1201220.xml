        <p>AFTER being a forgotten word for two decades, ''antitrust'' is again a part of the government's vocabulary.</p>
        <p>As if seeking a breakup of Microsoft wasn't enough, Justice Department lawyers recommended last week that WorldCom's $115 billion takeover of Sprint be blocked.</p>
        <p>The deal could still get done; representatives from both companies will argue their case this week before Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division. But Washington has been regulating the telephone business for so long that there presumably is already a strong sense at Justice of what is anticompetitive and what is not.</p>
        <p>Michael J. Mahoney, director of telecommunications investing at Dresdner RCM Global Investors, took time last week to discuss what may happen if the deal blows up or is drastically restructured. Following are excerpts from the conversation:</p>
        <p>Q.  The Justice Department is apparently concerned about consequences of combining the No. 2 and No. 3 long-distance carriers, and about dominance in Internet switching services. Are those valid concerns?</p>
        <p>A.  The Internet switching thing is not a surprise, and WorldCom has said they will deal with that. But the issue with long distance has been bigger than WorldCom has been willing to admit.</p>
        <p>They have argued that AT&amp;T will still be the dominant force, and that once the Baby Bells get into long distance, there will be lots of new competitors. Both of these have been specious arguments.</p>
        <p>It may be true that AT&amp;T will remain the dominant player, but this combination will constrict the long-distance business into too few hands.</p>
        <p>As far as the Baby Bells are concerned, WorldCom is right that there will be more competition, but it hasn't happened yet. Only New York has allowed a Baby Bell to offer long distance.</p>
        <p>Q.  What are the consequences for WorldCom if it doesn't acquire Sprint?</p>
        <p>A.  There is a big minus and a small plus if the deal doesn't happen. The small plus is they won't have paid a lot for Sprint.</p>
        <p>But they won't have the wireless piece of the pie, and strategically they need that. It would put them back in the market for a wireless property, and there are not many.</p>
        <p>Q.  Who might WorldCom go after?</p>
        <p>A.  There are only six names of up-and-running wireless operators: Verizon, which is jointly owned by Bell Atlantic and Vodaphone, which is almost certainly not for sale; AT&amp;T Wireless, which is also not going to get sold; SBC and BellSouth's wireless properties; Sprint PCS; Nextel; and Voice-stream, which is in the process of becoming a national player.</p>
        <p>WorldCom could go after a regional player, plus bid in the upcoming auctions for wireless spectrum later this year, but if they can't have Sprint PCS, it would make more sense to go after Voicestream or Nextel.</p>
        <p>Q.  Who might bid for the Internet switching business if WorldCom is forced to sell?</p>
        <p>A.  The Internet business is a very attractive business, and I understand Sprint's is state of the art. Any of the foreign carriers might be interested; so might Williams Companies, which is building out its own network.</p>
        <p>Q.  What are the odds now that WorldCom-Sprint will go through?</p>
        <p>A.  A week ago I thought it was a little better than 50-50; now I think it is a little bit less.</p>
        <p>The onus is on WorldCom to do some fancy footwork to get it done. Bernie Ebbers at WorldCom is a very resourceful man, but I wish he had moved more aggressively sooner on long distance.</p>
        <p>Q.  WorldCom is likely to argue, a la Microsoft, that the telecommunications industry is changing so rapidly that the competitive landscape is not what Justice makes it out to be. Is there any merit to that?</p>
        <p>A.  There is a little bit of that in this industry, but not like there is in the software business.</p>
        <p>Software is not regulated by the government; in very important ways, telecommunications still is. When we talk about entrants of new long-distance competition, we are really talking about a political process.</p>
        <p>By comparison, when you look at software you can make a very good case that it will innovate rapidly over the next couple of years.</p>
        <p>Q.  Which stocks in the business do you like?</p>
        <p>A.  We really like Voicestream and Nextel. We like WorldCom but would like all of this to get settled.</p>
        <p>We don't own Sprint right now, because the benefits of the WorldCom deal are already built into the share price.</p>
        <p>And we don't own AT&amp;T either, because we feel they have a lot of operating problems. Hopefully they will work through them. But the combination of having a lot to lose on their long-distance business and the operating issues are enough to make us wait and see if they get through them.</p>
