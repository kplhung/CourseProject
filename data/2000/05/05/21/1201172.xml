        <p>AS predictable as baseball and lovers, the rites of spring on the East End mean the opening of restaurants, new ones that blossom into summery way stations. The crop this season ranges from modest roadside cafes to elegant dining destinations.</p>
        <p>A few of the restaurants listed below opened last fall and winter. Now, along with more recent arrivals, they are entering their first summer season.</p>
        <p>Amazonia Grill-Churrascaria, 450 Route 27, Southampton (631-283-9113). This seven-month-old Brazilian offers authenticity and value with its plate-filling portions of robust peasant fare.</p>
        <p>Bridges, 294 Bridgehampton-Sag Harbor Turnpike, Bridgehampton (631-537-9105). This combination cabaret-restaurant, which opened late last year, features the Island's only Sunday gospel brunch and a menu of new American and down-home favorites.</p>
        <p>Georgica Grill, 47 Montauk Highway, East Hampton (631-329-9821). A simple, moderately priced menu of contemporary dishes covers all the bases, from pizza, burgers and sandwiches to yellowfin tuna, and sea scallops with orange ginger and three different curries.</p>
        <p>Phao, 62 Main Street, Sag Harbor (631-725-0055). This sophisticated, understated Thai restaurant opened in the dead of winter and has been drawing crowds ever since with its vividly seasoned, attractively presented low-fat food.</p>
        <p>Riccardo's Seafood House, 313 Three Mile Harbor, East Hampton (631-324-0000). Richard Traslavina, a Chilean who was the executive chef at 95 School Street and the Laundry, is now serving ceviche, gazpacho, fried clams, steamers and paella, rice and beans and guacamole in his own place.</p>
        <p>Saracen, Montauk Highway, Wainscot (631-537-6255). This southern Italian coastal cuisine spot, where Sapore di Mare was, is scheduled to open after Memorial Day. It is owned by a member of the family that has operated Angelo's on Mulberry Street in New York City for more than 100 years.</p>
        <p>Station Road, 50 Station Road, Water Mill (631-726-3016). The former Station Bistro features a seafood menu of eclectic global cuisine.</p>
        <p>The Greasy Spoon, 20 North Highway, Southampton (631-283-2663). This casual three-meal-a-day cafe plays 1950's music and serves sandwiches and entrees named for singers, musicians and actors from that period.</p>
        <p>Paradise Cafe, 126 Main Street, Sag Harbor (631-725-6080). The 100-year-old Paradise Building has been purchased by Bookhampton stores. Stephen Putnam, a highly regarded Connecticut chef specializing in new American cuisine, has been hired to run the kitchen.</p>
        <p>Tierra Mar, 230 Dune Road, Westhampton Beach (631-288-2700). Todd Jacobs, the chef and owner of Tierra Mar, has moved his restaurant to the site of the former Atlantica and is offering an all-new menu.</p>
