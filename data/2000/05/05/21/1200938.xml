        <p>Introduce a computer to a heap of raw data and the temptation to slice the information every which way can prove irresistible. One example is Amazon.com's purchase-circle program, which enables customers to see what books are popular among different groups. Apparently, the idea is that readers can learn the buying preferences of people with whom they might have something in common, or about whom they might be curious, and that one can glean insights into a place or company by seeing, for instance, that a top seller in Kenya is ''The Carbohydrate Addict's Lifespan Program'' or that in Hoboken, N.J., a number of people want to know how to put on a Jewish wedding.</p>
        <p>Amazon has two types of purchase-circle lists. There are rankings strictly by the numbers, and the Harry Potter books invariably top the list.

        <p>Introduce a computer to a heap of raw data and the temptation to slice the information every which way can prove irresistible. One example is Amazon.com's purchase-circle program, which enables customers to see what books are popular among different groups. Apparently, the idea is that readers can learn the buying preferences of people with whom they might have something in common, or about whom they might be curious, and that one can glean insights into a place or company by seeing, for instance, that a top seller in Kenya is ''The Carbohydrate Addict's Lifespan Program'' or that in Hoboken, N.J., a number of people want to know how to put on a Jewish wedding.</p>
        <p>Amazon has two types of purchase-circle lists. There are rankings strictly by the numbers, and the Harry Potter books invariably top the list. More interesting are the ''uniquely best-selling'' books -- titles that are more popular with a particular group than among Amazon.com customers generally.</p>
        <p>A recent look shows that people in affluent Pacific Palisades, Calif., for example, are working hard on their marriages and culinary skills. Winter Park, Fla., is steeped in self-pity; its residents read ''Trapped in the Mirror: Adult Children of Narcissists in Their Struggle for Self.'' And religion is a big deal in Nyack, N.Y.; the books selling there are ''More Light on the Path: Daily Scripture Readings in Hebrew and Greek'' and ''Encountering the Old Testament.''</p>
        <p>Overseas, meanwhile, all of Luxembourg seems worried about the stock market and the Internet bubble, while Romanians are obsessed with management and public relations. Latvians are more well rounded in their tastes, if a bit slow on the uptake, as they are just now discovering ''Emotional Intelligence,'' Daniel Goleman's 1995 best seller, and ''The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People,'' which was published in 1989. As expected, the French are worried about the United States. Amazon's No. 1 seller in France is ''Manifest Destiny: American Expansionism and the Empire of Right,'' a book that normally ranks around 102,000 on the company's main list. The French are also obsessed with Raymond Carver's ''Short Cuts.''</p>
        <p>In Chappaqua, N.Y., the new home of the Clintons, kids matter a lot; the biggest sellers there include ''Nurturing Good Children Now.''</p>
        <p>What are those in government buying? Representatives are working on their golf games and apparently taking some pleasure in reading about the fall from grace of their former colleague Dan Rostenkowski. Senators, on the other hand, are dipping into slightly more highbrow literature -- that is, until you reach</p>
        <p>No. 8 on their list: ''Diana in Search of Herself.''</p>
        <p>Then there are corporate purchases -- or, rather, purchases made by people who supply Amazon with their corporate e-mail addresses. Much has been made of the competitive lessons that can be taken from a company's reading list. At Qualcomm, a highflying high-tech company in San Diego, it would appear that when workers aren't busy exploring their surroundings (''Afoot &amp; Afield in</p>
        <p>San Diego'') and exercising, they are worrying</p>
        <p>about money, with five books on stock options and investment guides among the 10 best sellers.</p>
        <p>If you believe the purchase-circle data, employees at Wired Ventures are not only happy-go-lucky youngsters, they are uninterested in business books altogether, as they devour such works as ''Mind Hunter: Inside the F.B.I.'s Elite Serial Crime Unit'' and ''The Simpsons Forever!'' No. 9 there is ''How to Be a Great Lover: Girlfriend-to-Girlfriend Totally Explicit Techniques That Will Blow His Mind.''</p>
        <p>Not only are many Texaco employees on the same carbohydrate-rich diet that all of Cairo (Egypt, that is) is trying, but -- personnel managers, take note -- many are also buying ''What Color Is Your Parachute? A Practical Manual for Job Hunters and Career Changers.'' They're shedding pounds over at Toyota, too, but the workers are also interested in new approaches to management and are buying ''First, Break All the Rules: What the World's Greatest Managers Do Differently.''</p>
        <p>Not a frivolous moment is to be had at the Gap, where workers are buying ''Nothing's Impossible,'' a book about leadership, and ''The End of Fashion,'' about the mass-marketing of clothing. Then there's the beleaguered Levi Strauss &amp; Company, whose top books are ''Journey to the Emerald City: Achieve a Competitive Edge by Creating a Culture of Accountability'' and ''Building Strong Brands.''</p>
        <p>And at Microsoft? Everyone appears to be learning Japanese.</p>
        <p>The purchase-circle lists also neatly reinforce stereotypes. In Sedona, Ariz., known for its love of all things New Age, they're reading ''Sanctuary: The Path to Consciousness.'' Managers at the United States Postal Service still have a few morale kinks to iron out, as a big seller there is ''Why Employees Don't Do What They're Supposed to Do and What to Do About It.'' And NASA really is filled with geeks reading ''Low-Speed Wind Tunnel Testing.''</p>
        <p>Manhattanites, of course, are obsessed with parties, housing and finding a private school for their tots. Sure enough, they're reading ''The Manhattan Directory of Private Nursery Schools,'' ''The Manhattan Family Guide to Private Schools,'' ''New York's 100 Best Places to Have a Party'' and ''Tenant Power'' (author: Tenant X).</p>
        <p>Fun, isn't it? Maybe. Amazon has taken a lot of heat for the threat to privacy that its circles pose. It makes the argument that it does not make individuals' purchases public (even though its database is capable of doing so), and the lists give no actual sales figures. Further, a company or group can opt out and request that its buying habits not be included in the listings. Barnesandnoble.com, Amazon's biggest rival, which happily followed suit when Amazon began posting each book's sales ranking, has reached for the moral high ground. It publishes no equivalent to the purchase-circle lists. But the privacy concern seems to be something of a red herring. The real objections to the lists should center not on the threat to personal privacy they present, but on their silliness.</p>
        <p>So why does Amazon have purchase circles? To keep users on the site, clicking away voyeuristically while catching the Amazon aura? Even the company's executives seem a bit unclear on this point. During an interview, J. J. Jacobi, Amazon's director of product development, stumbled a bit at this question. Customers enjoy the lists, she said, and look at them ''just for fun.'' She carried on in this vein until her public relations woman, who was monitoring the interview, broke in to help her out. ''It's to help customers make better purchasing decisions,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Just how these lists are supposed to help customers make purchasing decisions is a mystery. But no matter. They will also tell you what's big in music, videos and electronics. Only in its selection of videos does Manhattan's intellectual bent emerge: after ''Sesame Street'' sing-along videos are ''The 400 Blows,'' ''Last Year at Marienbad'' and ''Jules and Jim.'' Chappaquidians, it turns out, are mad for the soundtrack from ''The Simpsons'' and the Backstreet Boys, the Palm V electronic organizer and the ''Yellow Submarine'' DVD. In fact, folks in Chappaqua buy a lot more DVD's than videotapes, which tells you something about their disposable income level, in case you didn't already know.</p>
        <p>IN La Jolla, Calif., another affluent community, the purchase lists show residents reading ''Life: The Science of Biology'' and ''The Pump House Gang.'' But if you want some real insight into La Jolla's literary preferences, ask Adrian Newell, a buyer and manager at Warwick's bookstore, whose inventory is small but whose customers realize that she always has them in mind. She knows they go for science essays and inspirational books but not celebrity biographies. She keeps ''Galileo's Daughter'' well stocked, along with ''Eleanor of Aquitaine.'' She also knows a good deal more about the lifestyles and political bent of her neighbors than Amazon does. ''The majority of my clientele is 50-something,'' she said. ''They are politically conservative, they like to travel and they have disposable income.'' She knows, too, that what sells well in La Jolla won't sell in the bookstore in the neighboring town of Del Mar. That store ''sells younger, edgier fiction,'' she said. ''Tons of Nick Hornby. Whereas I carry all these cozy mysteries.''</p>
        <p>When Amazon's computers can create a virtual Adrian Newell for each of its purchase circles, then it might really be on to something, even if that something is less fun to browse.</p>
