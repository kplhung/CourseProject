        <p>The odds, and their sorry luck, would tell you that the Nets cannot expect the Ping-Pong balls to flow their way in today's National Basketball Association draft lottery.</p>
        <p>But in a season in which there are no clear-cut choices in the draft, the Nets may find that wherever they roam through the lottery, they may find a star.</p>
        <p>''I think the player who would probably be regarded as one of the best is Kenyon Martin,'' General Manager John Nash said of the Cincinnati power forward. ''After that, it is a toss-up. We could draft seventh and get a player who could be the rookie of the year.''</p>
        <p>The Nets could draft seventh, the spot they now hold because they had the seventh-worst record in the league, or they could get a lucky bounce from the Ping-Pong balls and draw one of the top three positions. Or, if one or more of the teams behind the Nets in the seeding moves up, the Nets could drop to 8, 9 or 10.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the team that could have the biggest day is the Orlando Magic, which has five picks, with the last spot in the lottery and two more because of trades. The Magic inherited the third-highest slot from the Golden State Warriors as well as the 10th slot from the Denver Nuggets.</p>
        <p>The Knicks will select 22nd in the first round and do not have a second-round pick, having surrendered it to Utah. The Nets will select No. 36 over all in the second round.</p>
        <p>Behind Martin are a list of early entry candidates who moved to the top of the list as soon as they declared, center Chris Mihm of Texas, a first-team all-American, and the 6-foot-8-inch forward Marcus Fizer of Iowa.</p>
