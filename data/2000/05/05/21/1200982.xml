        <p>I WANTED to walk the Malvern Hills. For years I'd looked longingly at pictures of the broad paths along this high, undulating ridge, a dramatic nine-mile upheaval in the otherwise placid and gently rolling landscape of Hereford and Worcester in central England. The views from this ridge looked wonderful, the paths challenging but not arduous. So when my husband, James, and I planned five nights in the Malverns last spring, I promised James we would walk miles every day.</p>
        <p>But when we arrived at our cottage in Colwall, a village on the edge of Great Malvern, I had come down with a fierce cold. Since I was barely ambulatory, the hills would have to wait. We decided to explore the countryside by car instead. What we discovered was a remarkably unspoiled, often hidden world of tranquil valleys, shining rivers, wooded slopes and ancient half-timbered farmhouses -- perhaps the most beautiful pastoral landscape we'd seen in England. Among the many pleasures tucked into this countryside were a ruined Victorian mansion, an Edwardian garden, a fairy tale castle, one of England's oldest country houses, an Arts and Crafts church, and a great cathedral with the oldest extant medieval map of the world.</p>

        <p>I WANTED to walk the Malvern Hills. For years I'd looked longingly at pictures of the broad paths along this high, undulating ridge, a dramatic nine-mile upheaval in the otherwise placid and gently rolling landscape of Hereford and Worcester in central England. The views from this ridge looked wonderful, the paths challenging but not arduous. So when my husband, James, and I planned five nights in the Malverns last spring, I promised James we would walk miles every day.</p>
        <p>But when we arrived at our cottage in Colwall, a village on the edge of Great Malvern, I had come down with a fierce cold. Since I was barely ambulatory, the hills would have to wait. We decided to explore the countryside by car instead. What we discovered was a remarkably unspoiled, often hidden world of tranquil valleys, shining rivers, wooded slopes and ancient half-timbered farmhouses -- perhaps the most beautiful pastoral landscape we'd seen in England. Among the many pleasures tucked into this countryside were a ruined Victorian mansion, an Edwardian garden, a fairy tale castle, one of England's oldest country houses, an Arts and Crafts church, and a great cathedral with the oldest extant medieval map of the world.</p>
        <p>The Malverns began to work a healing magic as soon as we arrived at Green Gable, our Colwall cottage. A one-bedroom renovated outbuilding on the grounds of a small residential development, Green Gable, warm and cozy, had been furnished with every possible comfort and decorated with flair, including handsome hand-stenciling on walls and furniture. The owner, Marcia Ballard, who lived nearby, advised an herbal drink of spring onions, ginger and honey, brewed, strained and drunk straight down. Shortly afterward she appeared from her garden with a handful of new onions, still damp with dirt. I brewed, drank and, languishing in front of the television that night, began to feel a bit more lively.</p>
        <p>Since I am always cheered by gardens, we set out on our first full day for How Caple Court, whose 11-acre garden is being gradually restored to its Edwardian splendor. Nestled in a village a short drive from Colwall, How Caple was very quiet that chilly, showery morning. We were the only admirers of its scattered daffodils, sunken Florentine pool and winding walks among terraced beds. The garden was set off by many old  buildings of mellowed red brick, including a small Norman church, and from the much-enlarged manor house, which dates from the 12th century, we could look far out over the Wye Valley below.</p>
        <p>As we drove to and from How Caple, the fields were a tender blush of green accented with soft brush marks of white plum blossoms. Many of the farmhouses were black-and-white timbered -- some guidebooks call this black-and-white country -- and their crispness set off gardens and stone walls crammed with daffodils, purple creeping phlox, violets, pansies, bluebells and primroses. One old inn had hung baskets of bright yellow daffodils from each of its many windows, so that the whole facade seemed to be bursting into bloom.</p>
        <p>Another short drive took us to Brockhampton, a village known for All Saints Church, an Arts and Crafts masterpiece built in 1901-02 and designed by William Lethaby, a disciple of William Morris. With its striking belfry framed in oak, a roof thatched with Norfolk reeds, and windows, arches and floor constructed of an attractive local stone, the church has an elegant simplicity. Its remarkable craftsmanship includes graceful details of oak and stone and understated furnishings, among them a pair of luminous Burne-Jones tapestries.</p>
        <p>After winding through more back lanes, we paused for lunch at the Green Man Inn in Fownhope, a traditional black-and-white pub filled with locals and offering a reassuringly familiar menu (roast chicken, peas and chips; apple-raspberry crumble smothered in custard). This hearty meal gave me energy for further exploration, along roads that opened onto more glorious views of the Wye Valley. Near Fownhope, we even paused for a short walk through Haugh Wood, a small patch of wildness crisscrossed with paths.</p>
        <p>Before going home, we investigated the marvelously named village of Much Marcle, where a sign alerted us to the seasonal opening day of Hellen's, a medieval manor begun in 1292 and still inhabited by descendants of its original owners. Edging down a long drive called Monks Walk, we arrived at a brick house that still  resembles a fortress-castle. With additions in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, Hellen's exudes age, an atmosphere heightened by rather gloomy rooms, with much fine wooden paneling and many dark oil paintings. Our exuberant guide, who clearly loved the house, recounted its stories, from ghost sightings to the tragically real history of Hetty Walwyn, an 18th-century daughter, who was confined in one of those shadowy rooms for 30 years as punishment for a scandalous elopement. I left Hellen's with rather dampened spirits and a coughing spell.</p>
        <p>But, strengthened by more onion-and-ginger tea, I was ready next day to swoop back in time. In half an hour we were in the center of Hereford, an important market center for the county's white-faced cattle, cider, hops and Wye salmon, with a skyline still dominated by the lofty sandstone Hereford Cathedral. Begun in 1130, with many later renovations, the cathedral contains the largest surviving example of a medieval chained library in the world, with some of its books dating to the eighth century, and Mappa Mundi, the only 13th-century illustrated map of the world.</p>
        <p>Both library and map are now housed in a skillfully designed, subdued modern addition to the cloisters. We wandered first through the library, whose centuries-old huge tomes can still be lifted down from their chained perches and studied in place by qualified scholars, then browsed along display cases of priceless medieval illuminated manuscripts. Mappa Mundi, a surprisingly large piece of vellum, measuring 64 by 54 inches, was intriguing in its wealth of pictorial detail and in the assumptions the detail suggested. London, for example, was a tiny blob, less important than Lincoln, where the mapmaker lived, and both gave place to Jerusalem, which grandly dominated the center of the map -- and the medieval spiritual world.</p>
        <p>Still under the spell of the cathedral, we decided we would end the day with another church, Great Malvern Priory. With its soaring 15th-century architecture and a prized collection of medieval stained glass, floor and wall tiles, the building is a magnificent remnant of what was once a wealthy and important Benedictine monastery. Now a much-loved parish church, the priory sits companionably across from the town's busy main shopping street, just below the Malvern Hills, and not far from St. Ann's Well, original source of the town's crystal-clear spa waters. The town, like the whole Malvern area, manages to mix the worldly and spiritual with ease and panache.</p>
        <p>The next morning we rolled off to Eastnor Castle, less than 15 minutes' drive from Colwall. A huge turreted stone chateau in the Norman revival style, begun in 1812, Eastnor is set in an arboretum of majestic cedars, California sequoias and rare trees, overlooking a  wooded lake and adjoining its own deer park. Recently restored to a sumptuous freshness by its present  mistress, Sarah Hervey-Bathurst, whose husband's forebears built the castle, Eastnor is a castle with a difference.</p>
        <p>Tramping through seemingly endless rooms of antique furniture, paintings and gilded ceilings can be numbing, but Mrs. Hervey-Bathurst has turned her visitors' self-guided tours into an instructive and entertaining lesson. In each room, extensive placards, often with diagrams and photographs, explain the before-and-after process of restoration. Mrs. Hervey-Bathurst notes, often with an understated but sharp humor,  principles of interior decoration that can be applied to more ordinary houses. My favorite, after reading about the problems of rehanging a roomful of paintings, was: ''It is impossible to hang a bad picture.''</p>
        <p>Our next excursion was to Witley Court, in the northern part of the Malvern area. It is a spectacular ruin that was once one of England's grandest country houses. During the 1890's, the Prince of Wales was a regular visitor; the enormous Italianate house needed a staff of 150 servants, including 40 to  45 full-time gamekeepers. But a fire destroyed Witley Court in 1937, and the roofless, derelict house was left to the elements for decades.</p>
        <p>Now under the care of English Heritage, which comes to the rescue of many of England's historic treasures, Witley Court is no longer abandoned. The public can wander through its ground-floor rooms, examining its basic structure, passing through what once were walls, and trying to imagine the clink of glasses and strains of music. The once-renowned vast grounds, with formal beds and fountains, are being brought back to life. Still awesome, even in silence, is the elaborate stone Perseus and Andromeda fountain, reputed to be the largest in Europe, with sea monster and winged horse.</p>
        <p>Bing Crosby and Stewart Granger, the handbook claims, once wanted to buy these fountains and install them in a racecourse in Chicago. Strolling on the clipped green lawns, we looked back on columns, balustrades and terraces that looked like an extravagant theatrical backdrop. I could understand Witley Court's attraction for movie stars.</p>
        <p>A short drive through nearly iridescent green hills and rolling pastures took us from a cultivated ruin to an almost eerily preserved 14th-century manor house, the National Trust's Lower Brockhampton, north of the Malverns near Bromyard. We entered through a 15th-century half-timbered two-story gatehouse, so elaborately carved and decorated it would have suitably impressed any visitors to the house beyond. Lower Brockhampton is not large, although its vaulting timbered hall and upper gallery give the impression that it is. Outside the house, we walked around its daffodil-edged moat and looked beyond a fence to a low cloud of plum trees in full bloom, with sheep and newborn lambs munching the thick grass.</p>
        <p>On our last day, almost energetic, I announced I wanted to walk the hills. A few miles from Colwall, we parked along the road and struck out on a path that led upwards. On this sunny Bank Holiday Monday, many other families were on the same route, some pushing strollers. In less than 45 minutes we arrived at St. Ann's Well, now adorned with tearoom and shop, and its surrounding views over Great Malvern. As I'd imagined, the perspective was sweeping, over town and then fields to the River Severn beyond. The path continued to a higher ridge, and then to the miles-long route dipping across the tops of the hills.</p>
        <p>But walking the Malverns would have to wait. I wasn't really sorry. Even if we hadn't clambered to the peaks, we had found the foothills reward enough.</p>
        <p>Much Marcle, Mappa Mundi and other lures</p>
