        <p>THERE was so much good will blowing through the Altman Building on West 18th Street the other day -- generated, in part, by bottles of warm Carlsberg beer -- it hardly seemed like a fashion show. ''Fashion Strikes Down From the North!'' the invitation promised, in charming, Ikea-esque ''English is my second language'' prose, beckoning you to a three-day exhibition of fashion, food and design conceived by a magazine called Stockholm New. ''Frontline Nordic Gastronomy! Blondes with Braids!''</p>
        <p>By 8:30 on the night of May 10, the building was filled with hundreds of men and women with terrific skin smoking cigarettes. ''All Swedish people know each other, and I believe they're all in this room,'' said Johan Svensson, the art director of Jane magazine, explaining the absence of Americans.

        <p>THERE was so much good will blowing through the Altman Building on West 18th Street the other day -- generated, in part, by bottles of warm Carlsberg beer -- it hardly seemed like a fashion show. ''Fashion Strikes Down From the North!'' the invitation promised, in charming, Ikea-esque ''English is my second language'' prose, beckoning you to a three-day exhibition of fashion, food and design conceived by a magazine called Stockholm New. ''Frontline Nordic Gastronomy! Blondes with Braids!''</p>
        <p>By 8:30 on the night of May 10, the building was filled with hundreds of men and women with terrific skin smoking cigarettes. ''All Swedish people know each other, and I believe they're all in this room,'' said Johan Svensson, the art director of Jane magazine, explaining the absence of Americans. (Mr. Svensson is not Swedish, although his wife, Maria Virgin, is. Ms. Virgin is the fashion editor of Stockholm New, an English-language magazine of Swedish fashion and design with a circulation of 53,000.)</p>
        <p>A forest of fake fir trees lurked just inside the door, guarding a phalanx of five-inch-high Dalecarlian horses, the red-painted wooden horses that are the Swedish mascot. Other Swedish symbols were represented, too: a silver Volvo Cross Country; a display from the cheap-chic retailer H&amp;M featuring young Swedes in low-priced leather; and beautiful furniture in pale wood and wool made by contemporary Swedish designers, including a chair that looked like a fat comma designed by Bjorn Dahlstrom for a company called Cbi.</p>
        <p>Short films played as a backdrop to the catwalk show: there were clips of flames, of feathers floating in a river and, I think, of tick larvae. The models drifted by in clothes by five designers. Swedish furniture is smooth; Swedish fashion is rather furry.</p>
        <p>After the show, you could take plates of smoked salmon to tables covered with a vintage Marimekko design (Melooni, in orange, blue and black) that looked so right and so contemporary after all these years, you felt you had to have it. Marimekko is a Finnish company, but no matter; Nordic countries like to stick together.</p>
        <p>It was all very attractive and so familiar, because for some time now we've been in the midst of some sort of Nordic intermezzo, stylewise. The appetite for midcentury modern American furniture led, inevitably, to a taste for the clean-lined Scandinavian designs of the same era. Manhattan is full of 25-year-olds who burble passionately about the Finnish master Alvar Aalto and his Danish contemporary Hans Wegner, and there are entire stores, like Totem on Franklin Street, and magazines (hello, Wallpaper), devoted to this new/old aesthetic. It seems there's now an appetite for the entire Scandinavian lifestyle, lock, stock and herring.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow, the American Craft Museum will be the host of a seminar on Swedish furniture design.</p>
        <p>''We'll be talking about the fact that Scandinavian design has become a global phenomenon,'' David McFadden, chief curator at the museum, said. ''Why? Because there's something so human about it. Something spare and lean and wonderfully hopeful. It's that feeling I like very much.''</p>
        <p>Tyler Brule, 31, and the editorial director of the Nordic-worshiping Wallpaper, said, ''You could look at this whole thing as part of a broader Nordic moment.''</p>
        <p>''How did it start?'' he asked. ''You remember going to your Auntie's house and she had all these weird Danish pieces, and then it started to look really odd. In the 90's you wouldn't touch it, but now it looks right. It's not made out of a gel, and it doesn't have those scary spindly legs. It looks clean and maybe a little bit honest. That's why people are still switched on to this midcentury moment and by default great Scandinavian products. Look at cell phones. Those countries are way ahead of us in terms of cell phone penetration.''</p>
        <p>I mentioned to Mr. Brule the Marimekko tablecloths, how beautiful they looked and how weird it is that something you once dismissed as hopelessly retrograde could seem so fresh.</p>
        <p>''There's a girl in our office who dresses in head-to-toe Marimekko, and she looks fantastic,'' said Mr. Brule, who will be spending the summer in his new 60's modern house outside of Stockholm. ''You see the store in Stockholm, and it's so progressive. And it makes Miu Miu look not particularly progressive. If you go on to look at Swedish fashion design, you'll see that it's not particularly tricky. I think a lot of fashion, that's fashion with a capital 'F,' has become very tricky.''</p>
        <p>At his store Moss, on Greene Street in SoHo, Murray Moss sells the work of Pia Wallen, a contemporary designer, whose felt slippers and wool blankets with a Swiss cross have become like chocolates to people who can pronounce Arne Jacobsen properly. (It's arn YAK-ob-sen, and Mr. Moss also sells his vintage stainless steel flatware, which appeared in the movie ''2001: A Space Odyssey.'')</p>
        <p>''It comes from a lack in the diet,'' Mr. Moss said, using a nutritional metaphor to explain the taste for all things Scandinavian. ''You've had the gleaming stainless steel and aluminum and techno fibers in fashion and techno music and all of a sudden, the way you say, 'Too much salt!' you say: 'Where is the humanity in all this? Where is something tactile? Where is something fragile for God sakes!' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moss says the essence of current Scandinavian style resides with Droog Design, a Dutch collective with an intellectual bent.</p>
        <p>''The Scandinavian thing is a ripple effect,'' he said. ''Here's Droog: you get the designer Hella Jongerius, and she shows a carbon-fiber chair with this very raw felt that looks like a pelt out of 'King Lear' or something. It's from this company Not Tom, Dick or Harry -- get it? -- and the woman whose company it is raises sheep, she shears them herself and weaves the wool herself and sells it to Hella, who incorporates this raw wool into her chair, and the result is the hot-cold product. It's Baked Alaska.''</p>
        <p>''And if anything is a trend, that's an example of it,'' Mr. Moss added triumphantly.</p>
        <p>There were all kinds of hot-cold things at the Milan Furniture Fair last month, like a steel cube chair by a Dutch partnership, Do Create, which you warm up yourself by whacking with a sledgehammer (included with the chair).</p>
        <p>''That's a cartoonish example of what we're talking about,'' Mr. Moss said. ''It's a not-subtle manifestation of the idea that now we need to sense human interaction in design.''</p>
        <p>At a lunch in the Altman Building the day before the fashion show, there was smoked reindeer wrapped in thin bread, herring in mustard sauce on potato halves, smoked eel on rye bread, and scrambled eggs in little tarts -- a great platter of gamy amuse-gueules.</p>
        <p>They were followed by venison in a cepes and red wine sauce with nettle risotto.</p>
        <p>''You're going to need this napkin,'' said Pelle Sturen, chef at the Stockholm restaurant Brasserie Sturehof, shaking one into my lap.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sturen wore a Marimekko striped shirt and a Marimekko Lokki-pattern apron, which nicely set off his long blond hair and beard.</p>
        <p>Christina Sollenberg Britton, who publishes Stockholm New with her husband, Claes, let me wear her Pia Wallen bracelet. It was a silver cuff lined with felt. Very hot-cold, very Baked Alaska.</p>
        <p>''Stockholm is a very comprehensive place,'' she said. ''Maybe that sounds too boring? How can I explain the fashion? It has to be practical, to fit the needs of Swedish women. We have a cold climate. We work. These are the issues.''</p>
        <p>The clothes shown on the runway the next day included a nubby plum wool suit with bunches of stitches at the hip by Louisa Burfit. ''I was thinking about the simplest things,'' Ms. Burfit said. ''Things that a child would do in kindergarten.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wallen, who has branched out from slippers and blankets, showed elegant and fuzzy felt shifts in red and black and gray, with silver rivet holes at the neck. And there was some hilarious men's wear by J. Lindeberg, including peltlike fur and leather vests that went with 70's-style shirts in printed nylon -- I kept thinking, ''Huckapoo!'' -- and lowriders.</p>
        <p>Jens Grede, an editorial assistant at Stockholm New, offered this precis of Swedish fashion: ''It's something quite rustic. It's not super sexy. It's really hard to say in English. It's sort of mellow. I think Nordic fashion -- this will sound really strange -- is hard-hitting understatement. It's not monograms, anyway.''</p>
