        <p>Attention, coach class passengers:  that bag of honey roasted peanuts is about to look even more measly now that fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies are the least of the treats offered on the other side of the curtains. As airlines begin to recognize that they make most of their money in business and first-class travel, they are spending millions to upgrade long-distance planes and offer more luxuries to upper-class passengers.</p>
        <p>Virgin Atlantic, in addition to its slick new Kennedy Airport lounge, which boasts Warhol prints on the walls and a bar that could be transplanted to SoHo, will add fully reclinable seats to all its upper-class areas. British Airways gives away toiletries in amenity kits by Anya Hindmarch and will extend its sleeper seats from first to business class. ''That means there can be 84 people stretched out flat on their backs in one plane,'' said Honor Verrier, a spokeswoman for the airline. ''We will be the biggest bedroom in the sky.'' Singapore Airlines, which has sleeper seats in first class, hands out Givenchy-designed pajamas.</p>

        <p>Attention, coach class passengers:  that bag of honey roasted peanuts is about to look even more measly now that fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies are the least of the treats offered on the other side of the curtains.

        <p>And for those who remain upright, Delta is offering Business Elite passengers wine-tasting lessons. Virgin Atlantic is adding seated aromatherapy and massage services and plans to have a manicure and massage room by the end of the year. But with the price of most business-class tickets averaging $5,000 more for a round trip than economy seats, such luxuries don't come cheap. Start saving those frequent flier miles.</p>
