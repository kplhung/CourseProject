        <p>Private Gardens</p>
        <p>Following the lead of England, where private gardens have been opened to the public on special days for decades, the Garden Conservancy of America initiated a similar Open Days program and in 1995 published its first directory of hundreds of exceptional gardens all over the country.</p>
        <p>In the Northeast, the season begins in May. Two gardens may be seen today merely by showing up at the door and presenting the homeowner with $4, which goes toward the national preservation work of the Garden Conservancy and nonprofit local organizations.</p>

        <p>Private Gardens</p>
        <p>Following the lead of England, where private gardens have been opened to the public on special days for decades, the Garden Conservancy of America initiated a similar Open Days program and in 1995 published its first directory of hundreds of exceptional gardens all over the country.</p>
        <p>In the Northeast, the season begins in May. Two gardens may be seen today merely by showing up at the door and presenting the homeowner with $4, which goes toward the national preservation work of the Garden Conservancy and nonprofit local organizations.</p>
        <p>From 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. today, visitors may stroll through the woodland  paths at 69 Bayberry Road in Middlebury, admire the cactus garden, planted walls and troughs, a rock garden and a 32-foot landscaped greenhouse of and succulents.</p>
        <p>On the site of an old mill in South Glastonbury a garden of perennials, shrubs and mixed borders filled with naturalistic plantings runs along a brook for 300 feet. The address is 124 High Street and visitors will be welcome from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
        <p>A few simple rules of etiquette apply: no animals, no unsupervised children, no picture taking without the owner's consent, no littering or picking of flowers or plants. The privacy of the owner should also be honored by not attempting to contact him or her directly.</p>
        <p>For more information or to order this year's Open Days Directory of thousands of America's private residential and institutional gardens, call the Garden Conservancy in Cold Spring, N.Y. (914) 265-5384.</p>
        <p>Portraits From Southbury</p>
        <p>The York Square Cinema in New Haven is noted for its art gallery as well as its 55-year-old tradition of showing unusual domestic and foreign films that are not widely distributed. In its gallery through June 6 are a selection of portrait photographs made by Richmond Jones at the Southbury Training School in 1974 and 1975.</p>
        <p>During his long career as a photographer, Mr. Jones has produced work that appeared in exhibitions in Switzerland and Canada as well as in New York.</p>
        <p>His Southbury portraits are unusual in their focus on the individual. There are no shots of bleak interiors or institutional life, no polemics, no attempt to record a visual expose. Each portrait is skillfully composed, lighted and revealing of its subject. The theater's lobby gallery, at 61 Broadway, is accessible from 5 to 10 p.m., Monday through Friday, and from 1 to 10 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. The number to call for more information is (203) 776-6630.</p>
        <p>Old Lyme Centennial</p>
        <p>One hundred years ago the boarding house that Florence Griswold ran in Old Lyme became the home of the Lyme Art Colony, populated in summer by American Impressionists, including Childe Hassam, Willard Metcalf, William Chadwick, Walter Griffin and Wilson Henry Irvine.</p>
        <p>In celebration of the colony's centennial, Patricia Norcia, a New York actress, researched and wrote a one-woman play about six women who lived at the house during the summer of 1910. Ms. Norcia will portray all of them in two performances, at 3 and 8 p.m. on Saturday at the Ivoryton Playhouse on Main Street in Ivoryton. Each performance will be followed by conversation between the actress and her audience.</p>
        <p>In the course of the production she portrays Whistling Mary, the Irish housemaid; Matilda Browne, the artist; Beatrice Hoffman, an artist's wife; Ellen Wilson, the first wife of President Woodrow Wilson; a farmer's wife, and Florence Griswold herself.</p>
        <p>Tickets are $15, students and adults over 64 $12. Reservations, directions and more information may be obtained by calling (860) 434-5542.</p>
        <p>Beyond Stereotypes</p>
        <p>Robert Benson, Christine Breslin, John Garaventa, Thomas Giroir, Jack McConnell, Lanny Nagler, Rich Pomerantz, Edwina Stevenson and Michael Sundra (all members of the Connecticut chapter of the American Society of Media Photographers) are the contributors to an exhibition that celebrates the diversity and cultural heritage of Hartford and New Haven.</p>
        <p>Installed in the Promenade Gallery of the Bushnell in Hartford through June 4, the exhibition represents an effort by the artists to get past the cities' stereotypes and reveal often overlooked architectural and human attributes. The number to call for more information is (860) 987-6000.</p>
        <p>Thinking Ahead</p>
        <p>''Estate Planning Strategies: Avoiding Near-Death Tax Experiences and Bad Heir Days'' is the title of a program to be presented on Wednesday at 7:30 in the Cole Auditorium of the Greenwich Library.</p>
        <p>Two specialists, Conrad Teitell and Daniel L. Daniels, partners in the law firm of Cummings &amp; Lockwood, will offer advice on how to slash death taxes and how to insure that everyone is provided for: loved ones, charities and oneself. They will attempt to broaden the audience's understanding of estate planning as more than passing property along, and provide guidelines for the kind of planning that almost guarantees a good night's sleep.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daniels, a graduate of Harvard Law School, writes and lectures on estate planning, and is listed in Who's Who in American Law. Mr. Teitell has law degrees from Columbia University and New York University, and is listed in The Best Lawyers in America.</p>
        <p>The program is appropriate for all ages and all net worth levels, and will include a question and answer period. The library is at 101 West Putnam Avenue (Post Road) and admission is free. Call (203) 622-7900 for more information.</p>
        <p>Small Town America</p>
        <p>William S. Phillips's limited-edition prints on view at the Greenwich Workshop Gallery in Fairfield through next Sunday can be misleading. Viewers who grew up in small towns can look at his pictures and almost swear that they are looking at that town next to theirs or the town where an old friend lived.</p>
        <p>The model for ''Rejoice,'' one of the prints in the exhibition, could be the Fourth of July celebration in some pretty village, but it's a figment of the artist's imagination and a masterpiece of nostalgia.</p>
        <p>Of the 26 pictures in the show, 10 are aviation prints, the genre for which Mr. Phillips has been well known for decades. One print is of the Enola Gay, signed by the members of its crew.</p>
        <p>Hometown Americana is a new direction for Mr. Phillips. ''Rejoice'' is printed on coated canvas and then highlighted with oils by the artist. It is priced at $695. The original painting sold for $35,000, said Jim Conroy, a spokesman for the gallery. The remaining prints are priced from $175 to $365.</p>
        <p>The gallery, at 1657 Post Road, is open from noon to 5 p.m. on Sunday, from 10 a.m.to 4 p.m. Monday, from 10 to 5 Tuesday through Saturday, and until 7:30 Thursday evening. Call (203) 255-4613 for recorded information.</p>
