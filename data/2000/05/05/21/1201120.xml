        <p>EVERYONE who knows Candace Walsh, 27, describes her as a hopeless romantic, someone with long Pre-Raphaelite curls, a tendency to draw red hearts on her jeans and to ''blush big,'' as one friend put it, around men she likes. ''She's the kind of girl who will climb into people's windows if she loves them,'' said Canon Alicia Wing, another friend.</p>
        <p>Ms. Walsh, a freelance writer, lives in an apartment in the East Village between Avenues C and D (or as some of her friends put it, ''between Crime and Death''). Every month, Ms. Walsh holds ''beauty parlor night'' there, and she and her girlfriends paint their toenails pink, drink Wild Turkey and discuss love.</p>

        <p>EVERYONE who knows Candace Walsh, 27, describes her as a hopeless romantic, someone with long Pre-Raphaelite curls, a tendency to draw red hearts on her jeans and to ''blush big,'' as one friend put it, around men she likes. ''She's the kind of girl who will climb into people's windows if she loves them,'' said Canon Alicia Wing, another friend.</p>
        <p>Ms. Walsh, a freelance writer, lives in an apartment in the East Village between Avenues C and D (or as some of her friends put it, ''between Crime and Death''). Every month, Ms. Walsh holds ''beauty parlor night'' there, and she and her girlfriends paint their toenails pink, drink Wild Turkey and discuss love.</p>
        <p>In February last year, Ms. Walsh's love life wasn't going well at all. She had just broken up with a boyfriend -- a writer with a dark streak and a black leather jacket -- and was working at Little O, a vintage children's clothing store in the East Village. On the afternoon of Feb. 20, she decided to cheer herself up, so she hung a ''Back in 10 Minutes'' sign on the store's door and visited Von, a neighborhood wine bar. Ms. Walsh was the only customer there when Peter Rene Gaugy walked in.</p>
        <p>A son of Jean-Claude Gaugy, a painter, the younger Mr. Gaugy was working at a nearby gallery, selling paintings. He is clean cut, friendly and bohemian, yet refined in his tastes. When he drives cross-country his car blares Beethoven. ''Peter loves wine and old cars and ideas,'' said Tobias Lanz, a friend, ''Practical things are not his forte.''</p>
        <p>Sitting in Von, Ms. Walsh was amazed by Mr. Gaugy's varied stories and interests. ''He knows how to fix a car; he knows opera; he knows how to bake bread, French bread,'' she said. Just before leaving, she made sure to mention where she worked, several times. A week later, he walked into Von again and spotted her right away: she was waving her beer bottle and beckoning him over. ''When I saw him the second time, I thought, 'This is so lucky, I'm going to go for this!' '' she remembered. Before he left that night, she told him: ''I'm going to give you an assignment. Next time you get out of work, instead of eating out, come to the store and we'll order in.''</p>
        <p>To her surprise, he showed up the next afternoon. ''I got so nervous and excited and 'crushy' my body temperature went up about 10 degrees,'' she said. ''I remember thinking, 'My gosh, I'm going to have those little beads of sweat on my upper lip.' '' Sitting in the locked-up store, eating takeout Thai food on children's desks, they never ran out of conversation. ''It ended up being a four-day date,'' she said.</p>
        <p>A few months later they quit their jobs to take a car trip around the most deserted parts of New Mexico. ''We were driving an old car that might have mechanical trouble at any time,'' Mr. Gaugy said. ''Candace was not worried a bit. She was like, 'Don't worry about the consequences, just go forward.' On that trip, in a little hotel called the Gold Dust, we decided to move in together.''</p>
        <p>They now live in her apartment, and they ride their bikes to work together each day. She is the associate managing editor at Bookbuilders, a company that develops educational books; he is a salesman at the Sherry-Lehmann wine store. Each night, he reads essays aloud by Joan Didion (her favorite author), while she cooks dinner. He proposed last December, while they were decorating their Christmas tree with costume jewelry.</p>
        <p>On May 13, they were married at St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery, where Ms. Walsh was unabashedly romantic as a bride. She wore a sparkling rhinestone tiara with an ethereal Renaissance-style chiffon dress and looked like a harpist from a children's fairy tale.</p>
        <p>Afterward, the couple said they planned to stay in their apartment between Avenues C and D, and eventually start a family. ''We have a little shelf in our apartment that has a Sesame Street playhouse and a bunny rabbit and a child's painting on it,'' the bride said. ''That's for our child. It's just waiting.''</p>
