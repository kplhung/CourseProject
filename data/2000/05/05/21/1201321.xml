      <abstract>
        <p>An usually wide range of US companies has banded together to lobby Congress in support of pending China trade bill; automobile and auto-parts makers already have substantial investment in China; normalized trade would transform the way industry does business in China; pact would eliminate China's 80 percent local content rule, would end restrictions on private car dealerships and would bar China from demanding that auto makers hand over blueprints before they are allowed to build vehicles in China (M)</p>

        <p>General Motors is building Buicks at a $1.5 billion factory in Shanghai and is about to assemble Chevrolet S-10 pickups and Blazer sport utility vehicles in Shenyang. Ford makes delivery vans, car seats and radiators in China, while DaimlerChrysler assembles Jeep Cherokees and Mercedes sedans. Delphi Automotive Systems, the world's largest auto parts company, produces most everything from batteries to door latches there.</p>
        <p>Normalized trade ties would transform the way automakers do business in China, said Theodor Cunningham, executive vice president for global sales and marketing at DaimlerChrysler. China's requirement of 80 percent local content would disappear, allowing DaimlerChrysler to ship higher-quality parts from elsewhere. Chinese restrictions on private networks of car dealerships would end, as would requirements that extensive research and development be done in China, allowing DaimlerChrysler to design cars in Michigan for Chinese production. Perhaps most important, the country could no longer demand that the company hand over the blueprints for its minivans before allowing them to be built in China. For years, that rule has kept the company from starting production there, for fear that knockoffs would be made.</p>
        <p>''The entire package is very meaningful to us,'' Mr. Cunningham said.</p>
        <p>Union leaders dismiss the Chinese concessions, questioning whether they will be honored. ''Who's going to enforce it? We can't even enforce deals with Japan,'' said Mr. Yokich of the U.A.W.</p>
        <p>The union also expressed concern that permanent trade ties with China would make companies more comfortable about establishing factories there that might otherwise be built in the United States. Auto parts companies have already moved considerable production -- and jobs -- to Mexico, Mr. Yokich said.</p>
        <p>But J. T. Battenberg 3rd, Delphi's chairman and chief executive, said that concerns about American job losses were unwarranted and that most auto parts production in China would be for cars sold there. ''The point they miss,'' he said of critics, ''is that the logistics costs of moving parts around the world are expensive.''</p>
