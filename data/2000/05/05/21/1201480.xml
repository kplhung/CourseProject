        <p>LEVIN-Abner, 88, Music Retailer and Critic. Abner Levin, General Manager of Sam Goody's from its less than auspicious origins in a Ninth Avenue loft building in the early 1950's through its expansion to a half-dozen major metropolitan area outlets by the mid 1960's, died in Hilo, Hawaii on May 12 after a prolonged illness. Mr. Levin joined Sam Goody's at approximately the time the long playing record was introduced and it was under his direction that Goody's became the first retailer to stock long playing records in substantial volume and to market them at discounted prices. Described in a 1954 Collier's magazine profile as the man with the ''sharpest ears in America'', Mr. Levin was also a respected classical music critic who, in addition to co-authoring ''The Disc Book'', wrote an influential column for ''The Long Player'' record catalog (which he founded and edited). He is survived by his wife Flora, two sons, Robert and Andrew, a daughter, Jo, and a grandson.</p>
