        <p>SUMMER arrived three weeks ahead of schedule this year. Those few days of hot, humid weather gave us a preview of the delights to come. The lawn grew about six inches in two days, and the whole neighborhood was alive with the roar and smell of mowing machinery. The electric meter started whizzing around like a carousel, ants and bees and deer ticks appeared out of nowhere, and teenagers dragged their stereos outdoors in order to let everyone share their unbelievably vile music.</p>
        <p>These nostalgic reminders of summer in the suburbs give us a powerful incentive to go somewhere else. Faced with the prospect of spending  two whole weeks of summer vacation at home, catching up on the winter chores, most of us head out as fast as we can. In fact, we are sometimes so keen to go that we fail to plan our vacations rationally. People who hate culture find themselves being herded through the art galleries of Europe, while nervous and sensitive folks end up whitewater rafting down the Colorado.</p>
        <p>Three thousand years ago, the Delphic Oracle revealed the secret of successful vacation planning: know thyself. Never mind the rest of the family, they must make their own choices. But your personality is the key to the success or failure of your vacation. There's no need to consult a psychiatrist. Just take this simple test.</p>
        <p>Imagine that, in the middle of a busy working day, you suddenly have an unexpected hour of free time. Would you:</p>
        <p>(a) Take a brisk, healthy walk, regardless of the weather, perhaps  taking in a museum exhibit along the way?</p>
        <p>(b) Grab the phone, get on the Web and try to make the time as profitable as possible?</p>
        <p>(c) Collapse on to the nearest couch, and take a nap?</p>
        <p>If you answered (a), your psychology is ''Puritan.'' If you answered  (b), you qualify as ''paranoid.'' If, as I hope, you answered (c), then you fall into the category that, in psychological jargon, is called ''decadent.'' Now, you can plan your perfect summer vacation on the basis of your personality. A decadent person should not even think about a hiking holiday in Iceland, any more than a Puritan should contemplate a Mediterranean cruise.</p>
        <p>The Puritan vacation is a throwback to the harsh early days of American life, when the best time-out you could hope for was a short nap in church. The hallmark of the Puritan vacation is the pursuit of virtue through suffering. Most people spend money on vacations, but Puritans save it. They camp miles outside town in mosquito-infested swamps (very reasonable site fees), and dine off dried packaged foods bought at a quantity discount. They have nothing but contempt for tourists who stay in comfortable motels, eat at good restaurants and drink fine wines, as if vacations were about pleasure.</p>
        <p>Puritan vacationers also have very firm rules about holiday activities. They must be cheap or free, physically uncomfortable, and as boring as possible. The Puritan holiday activity must also have an element of serious self-improvement, so  the trip can be seen to justify its minuscule cost. So Puritan vacations tend to be heavy on culture: painting adobe churches in the noonday sun, toiling through endless museums, hiking down remote gorges to view Indian rock carvings, making long detours to worship at historic sites (Buffalo Bill slept here), and so on. The ultimate Puritan vacation would be a cycle tour in North Dakota in March.</p>
        <p>The payoff of the Puritan vacation is not relaxation or amusement, but virtuous achievement. ''It was a lovely four weeks,'' he said. ''We saw every museum in New England, and it only cost $150.'' Even the most paranoid travelers cannot compete with this kind of self-discipline, and the well-balanced don't even want to try.</p>
        <p>The second vacation style, which I call the paranoid, is very different, being entirely focused on maximizing pleasure. The characteristic concern of the paranoid vacationer is the terrible fear that a moment of  pleasure might be wasted. The paranoid holiday vehicle can easily be spotted on the highway, sagging under the weight of recreational equipment. Skis, surf boards, bikes, canoes and inflatable rafts are piled high on the roof, and all-terrain vehicles are towed behind.</p>
        <p>In spirit, the paranoid vacationer -- who is usually male -- has never left the office. His laptop and cell phone are never switched off. He has projects to complete, resources to mobilize and personnel to manage. The personnel consists of his unfortunate family, whose assigned task it is to use all that recreational equipment, even if it kills them. Any spare moments are scheduled for swimming, climbing local mountains, and  visiting national parks.</p>
        <p>The United States is too small for the seriously paranoid traveler. He is the ideal candidate for those whirlwind six-countries-in-six-days tours promoted by travel agents, or for any vacation packages that combine intense activities with an exhausting schedule (''Hang glide in Hawaii, walk the length of the Great Wall of China, safari in Africa and cross-country ski in Antarctica, all in five action-packed days . . . '')</p>
        <p>The essence of the paranoid vacation is not virtue, but productivity. One can imagine the exhausted family on the homeward journey, tallying up all the miles driven, paddled, rafted, cycled, skied, climbed, swum, scuba-dived, surfed and hiked, as well as games played, theme parks visited, fairground rides taken and jogging assignments completed, to say nothing of photographs snapped, burgers eaten, sodas drunk, states and nations ticked off the list. ''Well,'' says dad, entering the details into the family vacation database as they head home, ''We made a 6.4 percent improvement on last year. That's what I call a vacation!''</p>
        <p>Those of us who are fortunate enough to enjoy the type of personality that (implying no value judgment) I call ''decadent,'' regard both Puritan and paranoid vacations with horror. Fortunately, there is a whole industry devoted to our needs.</p>
        <p>The decadent vacation requires no strenuous activities or compulsory sights. It is located outside of time and space, at a resort, or a fine old hotel, or a rented cottage in the south of France or even on one of the more stylish cruise ships. The true purpose of the decadent vacation is to have nowhere to go, nothing to do, and nothing to remind you of your worries in other places. The decadent vacation paradise sets sharp boundaries between itself and the outside world, and tries to be all the things that the outside world is not -- totally calm, utterly safe, perfectly beautiful, and ineffably convenient. Everything is laid on, from decorously slow-moving sports to soothing and respectable entertainments.</p>
        <p>Entirely satisfactory meals arrive at regular hours, and the sun almost never goes behind a cloud. It's like being dead, except that you continue to eat.</p>
        <p>Are you Puritan, paranoid or decadent? When it comes to summer vacation planning, only your travel agent needs to know for sure.</p>
