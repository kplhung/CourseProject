        <p>In his first liturgical act as New York's archbishop-elect, Bishop Edward M. Egan ordained five graduates of St. Joseph's Seminary yesterday in a solemn Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral that began their lives as priests in a church ailing for new faces.</p>
        <p>The five men flattened themselves against the cathedral floor, deathly still, as scores of bishops and priests in the sanctuary chanted for all the saints, from Mary down through the ages, to bless them in their new lives. ''Pray for us,'' the congregation sang in refrain.</p>

        <p>In his first liturgical act as New York's archbishop-elect, Bishop Edward M. Egan ordained five graduates of St. Joseph's Seminary yesterday in a solemn Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral that began their lives as priests in a church ailing for new faces.</p>
        <p>The five men flattened themselves against the cathedral floor, deathly still, as scores of bishops and priests in the sanctuary chanted for all the saints, from Mary down through the ages, to bless them in their new lives. ''Pray for us,'' the congregation sang in refrain.</p>
        <p>The graduates of the seminary in Yonkers kneeled on the steps of the altar while Bishop Egan, and their new brethren, laid hands on their heads. And they pledged lifelong ''respect and obedience'' to Bishop Egan and whoever might succeed him as head of the church in New York.</p>
        <p>At a time when the Roman Catholic Church's demands for personal sacrifice and celibacy have left it with an aging and dwindling priesthood, the bishop's presence at the ordination highlighted the priority he has made of rejuvenating the priesthood.</p>
        <p>In his homily, Bishop Egan said the men must give of themselves without reservation. ''We'll make it, and we won't count the cost,'' he said, promising them, through that act, ''all the happiness and fulfillment one can have this side of paradise.''</p>
        <p>The tall, commanding bishop also urged them to remain true to the teachings of the church, and not to shrink from ''hard sayings'' or stands, no matter how unpopular they might be in the modern world. ''We will never pass them over,'' he said. ''We'll never water them down.''</p>
        <p>The new priests are Frank W. Bassett, 51, a former official at the Federal Aviation Administration; Edwin H. Cipot, 44, a former minor-league baseball player for the Mets and an actor; Joseph McLafferty, 31, who has worked to build low-cost housing in Harlem; Floyd A. Grace, 34, a Fordham University graduate with a degree in computer systems management; and Eric D. Rapaglia, 32, a former science teacher.</p>
        <p>While tourists who happened upon the ordination seemed awed by the organ music, robes and pageantry -- with one whispering to her friend, ''You don't see that every day,'' as the clerical procession filed out --relatives of the new priests said they were delighted to see Bishop Egan lead the ceremony.</p>
        <p>They noted that in his homily, Bishop Egan spoke of six, not five, ordinations, including himself among the newcomers to the New York Archdiocese.</p>
        <p>''Six new priests here at the Cathedral of St. Patrick,'' he said. ''Five young and sprightly, and the other, well, gray and enthusiastic.''</p>
        <p>Bishop Egan will officially become archbishop at his installation on June 19, replacing Cardinal John O'Connor, who died of brain cancer earlier this month.</p>
        <p>Joanne Procaccino, waiting for Father Rapaglia, her cousin, as he posed for photos, said she believed that Bishop Egan's grouping himself with the new priests would prove a source of inspiration for them in the years ahead.</p>
