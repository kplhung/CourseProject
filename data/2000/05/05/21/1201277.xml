        <p>IF there is any place that captures the quiet desperation of Brazil's sugar industry, it is probably the Bar do Gaucho, an open-air drinking establishment in this gritty town surrounded by seemingly endless fields of green sugar cane.</p>
        <p>This is where Antonio Carlos Castilho, the owner, serves up shots of cachaca, the potent yet dirt-cheap rum derived from sugar; the drink is favored by the cane cutters who wander in to idle away the day or shoot billiards on a raggedy table.</p>
        <p>''Sugar cane teaches you to love anything else that is not sugar cane,'' Mr. Castilho, 43, himself a former cane cutter, mused one afternoon. ''Run from cutting cane any way you can, because it is the surest way of being a slave without even knowing it.''</p>
        <p>It has been more than a century since Brazil, the world's largest sugar producer, prohibited slavery, although sugar has played an important role in Brazil's economy for nearly five centuries, since shortly after the Portuguese established a foothold in the New World. The harvest can still be brutal, depending to considerable measure on a sinewy arm swinging a big knife at the base of a cane stalk.</p>
        <p>But in many ways, the sugar industry has witnessed unprecedented change during the last few years. Indeed, the country's modernization -- the shift in power from an entrenched provincial oligarchy to a sophisticated urban elite, the swap of low-technology economic practices for high-technology tools and the discarding of isolationism for greater integration with a global economy -- has been played out with fervor in the industry.</p>
        <p>Sugar workers like Miguel de Oliveira, who is 59 but has the leathery skin of a man a decade older, know this well. ''It has been good fortune to have lived this long doing such work,'' Mr. Oliveira said outside his home near the Bar do Gaucho as he showed visitors his facao, the arm-sized knife used to harvest sugar cane. ''The smell of burning cane that makes your body sweat before the heat reaches you, that is the smell of my life.''</p>
        <p>But it is likely that Mr. Oliveira's grandchildren will never know what cutting sugar cane is like. In the sugar plantations surrounding Sertaozinho in this fertile region of southeastern Brazil, harvesting machines are fast replacing people.</p>
        <p>During the last decade, as the share of the crop harvested mechanically rose to more than 50 percent on many sugar cane plantations, the number of people working in Brazil's sugar industry has declined to 700,000, from 1.2 million, according to the National Confederation of Agricultural Workers in Brasilia.</p>
        <p>The trend shows few signs of letting up as mechanization moves forward. Understandably, growing joblessness in the sugar industry is heightening social tension in Brazil's countryside and in the small cities that serve as hubs for the agricultural industry.</p>
        <p>''Who knows what these people will do, if they are desperate and out of work?,'' asked Ceres Oliveira Bueno Abe, a retired schoolteacher who lives in Piracicaba, a city surrounded by sugar cane plantations in the interior of the state of Sao Paulo. ''Who can blame them if they resort to crime to feed their families?''</p>
        <p>While many out-of-work cane cutters are expected to migrate to the gritty peripheries of large cities like Sao Paulo or Recife, in the country's northeast, just as other hard-pressed farmhands and their families have done during the last several decades, others do not see that as a viable choice.</p>
        <p>''My existence is here and I'm doing everything I can to make sure I am not dependent on sugar cane,'' said Julio Faria, 24, a regular at the Bar do Gaucho who has secured work as a painter at a nearby metals factory to supplement his income as a part-time cane cutter.</p>
        <p>THESE grim long-term prospects stand in contrast to the improvement in the lot of large numbers of cane cutters and millions of other low-skilled laborers in Brazil in recent years. Indeed, some argue that rural workers' economic gains have fueled the drive to mechanize agriculture.</p>
        <p>According to union statistics, the base salary for sugar workers in the southern region of the country has risen in recent years, above the monthly minimum wage of $85, to about $122 a month, while in the poorer northeast the base salary is about $100 a month. Much of the advance resulted from the growing clout of rural unions.</p>
        <p>Ninety percent of sugar workers are hired under labor legislation giving them benefits like limited unemployment insurance and the chance to retire with a small government pension. The number is up from less than 50 percent a decade ago.</p>
        <p>Working conditions have also improved. In Sao Paulo state, for example, authorities moved to prohibit the burning of sugar cane. Although burning makes it easier to harvest cane by hand, because much of the stalk is removed, it is also dangerous because of potential harm to the lungs of cane cutters and the chance that winds could cause field fires to go out of control, burning cutters to death. ''It is inhuman and absurd to think that a modern democracy could permit such a practice,'' said Alceu Arruda Veiga Filho, the director of Sao Paulo's Institute of Agricultural Economics.</p>
        <p>Such victories for the sugar workers have inspired other low-income workers, like maids and other agricultural laborers, who have sued to get their employers to grant them  some benefits.</p>
        <p>In the sugar workers' case, though, the advances are deceptive, because the growing expense of hiring laborers has led many growers to replace people with machines.</p>
        <p>''It is the dilemma of Brazil,'' said Guilherme Pedro Neto, a director of the National Confederation of Agricultural Workers. ''The poor win concessions but are no better off than before, and probably worse. It is like we're winning battle after battle, but losing the war.''</p>
        <p>OF COURSE, sharp inequalities have defined Brazil and its sugar industry for 500 years. In the 16th century Brazil became the world's leading sugar producer, with much of the colonial slave-owning society built around the workings of the sugar plantations.</p>
        <p>In fact, historians say sugar's dominant role helps explain why  slavery in Brazil was said to be more harsh than in many other New World colonies, including the United States.</p>
        <p>''Sugar was a killing activity,'' said Stuart Schwartz, a professor at Yale University who has written about the history of Brazil's sugar industry. ''The mortality rate in sugar was higher than in any other agricultural activity.''</p>
        <p>In the mid-17th century, when the Caribbean colonies of European powers began emerging as leading sugar producers, sugar began to decline in importance in Brazil. Only in the 20th century did the country re-emerge as the world's leading sugar producer.</p>
        <p>A program designed by the country's military dictatorship in the 1970's to drive development was responsible for an immense increase in sugar output. Wary of high petroleum prices, the generals asked, why not use sugar, so abundant in Brazil, to produce alcohol for use as an automobile fuel?</p>
        <p>The program was a huge lift for the sugar industry. As recently as a decade ago, 90 percent of Brazil's automobiles were powered by fuel made from alcohol, when generous subsidies buoyed its production. Sugar developed into an advanced industry, with cultivation and processing integrated at various sites.</p>
        <p>At nearby Santa Elisa, for instance, a sugar plantation that employs many residents of Sertaozinho, there are processing and production facilities that resemble a futuristic petrochemical complex. A stone's throw away are vast fields where sugar cane is harvested by machines and by hand.</p>
        <p>But just as sugar grew in importance after the military government encouraged alcohol production, the crop fell out of favor when democratically elected leaders in the 1990's went about dismantling the privileges enjoyed by the ''usineiros,'' as Brazil's sugar barons are called.</p>
        <p>Slowly and subtly, the government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, drawn from urban bankers, academics and foreign-educated economists, went about slashing the subsidies enjoyed by the sugar industry. In stages, elaborate financing programs and price support systems were phased out, and producers were forced to cope with free-market forces.</p>
        <p>TODAY, only 1 percent of Brazil's cars run on sugar-based fuel -- a change welcomed by many motorists. Alcohol was cheaper and said to be cleaner-burning than regular gasoline, but it could be a problem during the moderately cool winters in southern Brazil: alcohol-fueled cars often took a long time to warm up.</p>
        <p>Instead, most cars now run on gasoline, much of it from domestic sources, a result of efforts to bolster production, mainly at offshore drilling platforms. The country now produces nearly three-fourths of its petroleum needs, up from less than half a decade ago.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the government has moved to liberalize parts of the oil industry through the sale of concessions to foreign companies seeking to drill at offshore sites. As market  forces come to dominate the country's fuel sector, the usineiros' prestige has declined.</p>
        <p>To many Brazilians, the wealthy usineiros, who sent their children to be educated at finishing schools in Europe while migrants from the countryside swelled the slums surrounding the large cities, have long been a symbol of the nation's social inequality.</p>
        <p>In Pernambuco, a state in Brazil's northeast, a literary movement originated by the novelist Jose Lins do Rego used the contrast between the usineiros' wealth and the poverty of their workers as a platform to discuss Brazil's ills.</p>
        <p>Today, leaders of the Landless Workers Movement contend that stubbornness of the usineiros is a main reason that Brazil, unlike other large Latin American countries such as Mexico, did not have an effective land reform program until the 1990's.</p>
        <p>''The sugar industry was really despised for many years because of the favoritism it enjoyed on the part of the state,'' said Tamas Smrecsanyi, a professor at the University of Campinas. ''So it's really no big deal for society to see them suffering a little in having to adapt to new times.''</p>
        <p>It is no surprise that many usineiros are unhappy with the changes of recent years. Maurilio Biagi Filho, the owner of Santa Elisa, one of the country's largest sugar plantations, is among the most vociferous critics.</p>
        <p>''We have the most fantastic soil in the world, the best climate, everything really, and yet we're suffering,'' Mr. Biagi said as he barreled over a dirt road on his plantation at 80 miles an hour in his alcohol-powered Volkwagen sedan, one hand on the wheel, the other motioning in the air. ''What do they want us to do, flood the world market with sugar?''</p>
        <p>Actually, that is exactly what is happening. As the usineiros wade their way through the free market, many of the 120 sugar-producing countries around the world that cannot effectively subsidize or shield their sugar industries from foreign shocks are increasingly concerned about the changes in Brazil.</p>
        <p>In what analysts have called the ''alcohol bomb,'' Brazil has transferred sugar to export markets that was previously used to produce alcohol. The price of raw sugar has plunged by 40 percent during the last year, to about 6.3 cents a pound from 10 cents, as international markets have struggled to absorb Brazil's rising exports.</p>
        <p>During the last few years, the country's annual sugar production has risen to 20 million tons, from 13 million, as wider use of mechanization has both increased efficiency and cut costs. By contrast, Cuba, another country with a large sugar industry, produces 4 million tons.</p>
        <p>The devaluation last year of the Brazilian currency, the real, made the price of the country's sugar more competitive in foreign markets. But the downward pressure on prices continues to mount, with dampened demand in countries like Indonesia and Russia. so Brazil's producers are enticed to export even more.</p>
        <p>''It's like watching a Greek tragedy unfold, witnessing today's situation,'' said Tony Hannah, an analyst at the London-based International Sugar Organization and co-author of ''The International Sugar Trade.'' ''The bomb just keeps on exploding.''</p>
        <p>LAWS here that still require small amounts of alcohol to be added to gasoline have eased the situation a bit. But it is difficult to discern whether the legal protections  that produced the alcohol industry will survive much longer.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to fire my cutters,'' Mr. Biagi, the usineiro, said. But he added that such layoffs are a growing trend ''and the government needs to be prepared to help them find other jobs.''</p>
        <p>And, in a thinly veiled warning to the authorities, he said that if growers were to use all of their cane to make sugar, they could produce 40 million, doubling Brazil's production, an increase that would have dire consequences for the world market. The government must come to realize that possibility, Mr. Biagi said. ''I don't think it does.''</p>
