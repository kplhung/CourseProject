        <p>Correction of May 14 report on marriage of Nicole Judith Barth and Neal Andrew Thompson (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A report last Sunday about the marriage of Nicole Judith Barth and Neal Andrew Thompson misstated the location of her mother and stepfather's current residence. They live together in Manhattan, not separately in Middlefield, Ohio, and Ridgewood, N.J.</p>
        <p>The report also misstated the location of Ms. Barth's first encounter with Mr. Thompson. It was at the home of her mother and stepfather, then in Ridgewood, not at her stepmother's home in Paterson. In addition the report referred incorrectly to the Cape Cod home in which the proposal took place. It is owned by her mother and stepfather, not her stepmother.</p>
