        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Sylvia Ann Hewlett (Op-Ed, May 16) overlooks an obvious reason why mothers earn less than women who are not mothers: by virtue of their responsibilities at home, mothers are in general less committed to their careers. This is not a bad thing; it's just life.</p>
        <p>When deciding whom to promote, employers evaluate many qualities, one of which is the time and effort and commitment that someone is able to apply to the job. If two women have similar jobs in the same company, and one chooses not to have children so she can focus on her career, shouldn't the company reward her for that choice?</p>

        <p>This is not discrimination against mothers, but recognition that people make choices and that there are consequences.</p>
