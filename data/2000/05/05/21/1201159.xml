        <p>THE popular image of tequila has always been of a party drink, of ritualistic salt-licking and lime-sucking, of frozen margaritas and barroom games. But to connoisseurs, tequila has a whole other single-malt-Scotch side, with some versions costing hundreds of dollars a bottle and made for sipping out of brandy glasses while noting subtleties of bouquet and flavor.</p>
        <p>In his new Tequila Nacional Silver, W. Park Kerr has made a tequila that connoisseurs will appreciate. With its pure aromas of minerals, salt and lime, and smooth yet biting agave flavor, I found that Nacional already tastes like the essence of a good margarita.</p>

        <p>THE popular image of tequila has always been of a party drink, of ritualistic salt-licking and lime-sucking, of frozen margaritas and barroom games. But to connoisseurs, tequila has a whole other single-malt-Scotch side, with some versions costing hundreds of dollars a bottle and made for sipping out of brandy glasses while noting subtleties of bouquet and flavor.</p>
        <p>In his new Tequila Nacional Silver, W. Park Kerr has made a tequila that connoisseurs will appreciate. With its pure aromas of minerals, salt and lime, and smooth yet biting agave flavor, I found that Nacional already tastes like the essence of a good margarita.</p>
        <p>Tequilas come in two basic forms. Ordinary blended tequilas, including familiar brands like Jose Cuervo, start with anywhere from 51 to 99 percent agave juice. Top-flight tequilas are made with 100 percent blue agave and always say so on the label; Nacional is an example.</p>
        <p>Tequilas are also categorized by age. A white or silver tequila has little or no aging. Reposados are aged in wood at least 60 days, and often up to a year, while anejos must be aged at least a year in small wooden barrels. Aging in wood typically mellows tequila, giving it a golden-brown color and often adding complexity. Some blended tequilas are brown or gold, but the color comes from the addition of caramel or other coloring agents, not from aging.</p>
        <p>Some people say silver tequilas are the purest expression of agave, with flavors unchanged by wood. I don't think I would sip Nacional Silver after dinner the way I might Cognac or an extra-smooth anejo tequila. But it will make an excellent margarita, straight up, no salt needed.</p>
