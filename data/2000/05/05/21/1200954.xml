        <p>Iceman</p>
        <p>Uncovering the Life and Times</p>
        <p>of a Prehistoric Man</p>
        <p>Found in an Alpine Glacier.</p>
        <p>By Brenda Fowler.</p>

        <p>The high Tyrol is a popular area for serious mountain hikers. Among the glaciers along the mid-Alpine ridge between Italy and Austria, they tote their backpacks from one mountain lodge to another. In the fall of 1991, two of them found evidence that Alpine hiking has a long history. They stumbled upon a corpse protruding from a melting glacier. The local authorities' first response was to check through the file of missing persons. But once archaeologists were called in and saw the corpse's hiking gear, they explained that a positive identification was unlikely. The mystery backpacker was about 5,000 years old.</p>
        <p>The Iceman, as he quickly became known, was an overnight sensation. As soon as the story broke, a flurry of questions spawned even more answers. What was the Iceman doing so high in the mountains? And how did he meet his end? Perhaps he was a hunter, or a metal prospector. Or maybe he had driven his sheep up to summer pastures, as local shepherds still do, and tarried too long, to be caught by an early snowstorm and buried at the bottom of a glacier for five millenniums.</p>
        <p>Some theories were even more imaginative. The Iceman's body was liberally ornamented with tattoos, and he carried a stash of possibly hallucinogenic mushrooms. Could he have been a shaman or hermit, journeying to a sacred site for religious purposes? Suspicious signs of bodily damage whipped up the excitement still further. Lesions to the head suggested trepanation, and the genitals seemed to have been removed. Some rumors even talked of sperm traces in the anal tract. Ritual killing, or worse, could not be ruled out.</p>
        <p>In the months immediately following the discovery, political controversy was added to this froth of speculation. On the icebound slopes, the Austrian-Italian border is not always clear-cut. The officials who dug out the Iceman took him to the local University of Innsbruck in Austria. But when the excitement subsided, the body's icy grave turned out to have been a hundred meters inside Italy. Some Italian voices started to make increasingly loud noises about repatriation. Happily, regional solidarity won out over national rivalry. Historically, the Italian side of the Alps defines itself as Tyrolean first and Italian second. When the local Italian politicians, in a spirit of Tyrolean solidarity, said they were happy for Innsbruck to retain custody of the body, Rome sensibly acquiesced. As the quid pro quo, the body would eventually be returned to the Italian Tyrol, once the initial scientific investigations were over.</p>
        <p>Brenda Fowler's elegant and informative book divides itself equally between the scientific investigations and the political shenanigans. From the archaeological point of view, the Iceman was a godsend. At least twice the age of other bodies recovered from ice or bogs, he offered a unique window on the dawn of civilization. Much of our knowledge of prehistory comes from artifacts interred at ritual burial sites. But the Iceman died carrying the tools of everyday life, and so tells a direct story of the way his people wrung sustenance from the land. The treasure-trove uncovered with his body included a longbow, a quiver of arrows, a copper ax and a leather ''fanny pack'' containing sewing materials and flint blades. Archaeologists had long been familiar with fragments of these items, but now they could see how they fit together.</p>
        <p>Archaeology is a curious mix of precision and imagination. Gathering the data requires painstaking care. Remnants of past lives must be dug up, labeled, pieced together and compared with other relics. After that comes the detective work. It is one thing to find out about our ancestors' pots and pans. But what we really want to know is what they did on a Saturday night. The best archaeological theorizing uses amazing powers of deduction to weave slender threads of evidence into convincing reconstructions of past lives.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, though, there is often pressure to outrun the evidence. The wider public wants stories, not caution. Curiously, the very imperfection of the evidence can itself provide an incitement to fabulation. Simply because of their ancient provenance, archaeological remains typically display signs of damage. This makes it all too easy to read tales of dismemberment, garroting and human sacrifice into ordinary finds of twisted and perforated bones.</p>
        <p>The public interest surrounding the Iceman could not have been more intense, and Fowler, who contributes articles on science and travel to The New York Times, explains how the academics entrusted with his care did not always resist the temptations. Within two years of the discovery, Konrad Spindler, head of Innsbruck University's department of early history, had written a popular book, ''The Man in the Ice,'' which spared no ingenuity in reconstructing the Iceman's last days. As Spindler saw it, the problem was to explain why the Iceman and his equipment were so damaged, given the presumed gentle death in an autumn snowstorm. Spindler's solution was an elaborate fable. The Iceman had already herded his sheep back down to his village at the end of the summer. But his arrival home triggered a violent altercation, possibly fueled by sexual jealousy, from which he fled in a battered state back up to his familiar summer haunts, only to be killed by the elements.</p>
        <p>Spindler's theory attracted plenty of public interest. In the background, however, a large team of investigators was subjecting the relics to intensive tests. Fowler makes it clear that her sympathies lie with the fact merchants rather than the fabulists. The overall moral of her story is that patience wins the day. The long trail of hard evidence leads to the reward of eventual truth. Her particular hero is Klaus Oeggl, an Innsbruck paleobotanist whose stock in trade is organic samples from prehistoric bogs. Given the chance to apply his techniques to the Iceman's gut, Oeggl showed that the ill-fated cadaver contained undigested pollen from the hop hornbean, a plant that blossoms only in the spring. This meant that the Iceman couldn't possibly have perished in a snowstorm. He must have died earlier in the year, probably from a fall, which would explain his injuries without any need to bring in yarns of jealousy or flight.</p>
        <p>Fowler relates a number of other facts that the researchers have wrung from the data the hard way. The Iceman came from the Italian side of the mountain and seems to have been primitive even by the undemanding standards of his time. He wore furs with leather undergarments, which he appears not to have changed from month to month, and which may well retain his body odor to this day. If he did herd sheep, there is no sign that he used them for milk or wool, as opposed to simple slaughter. His one modern characteristic was his abnormally hardened arteries, due no doubt to his unhealthily high-cholesterol diet.</p>
        <p>The Iceman now lies in a specially constructed museum in Bolzano, capital of the Italian Tyrol. Some quarter of a million people have been to see him, and many would no doubt prefer to have his dry relics enlivened with tales of prehistoric passion. But Brenda Fowler shows how a different kind of satisfaction can derive from careful science done well. The results may not be as sensational, but there is something wonderful about being sure about anything that happened up in the mountains so long ago.</p>
