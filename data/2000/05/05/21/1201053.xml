        <p>To the Editor: We recently spent a month on Vieques and were very interested to read the article ''Vieques, Mostly Mellow'' (April 9).</p>
        <p>The beautiful Navy beaches, which we visited last year, were closed because of continuous demonstrations at the entrance to Camp Garcia and elsewhere on Navy property. The demonstrators had built a grandstand and had many new tents. We were told these people were mostly from other parts of Puerto Rico and not from Vieques. One of the points made by these demonstrators was the high incidence of cancer on Vieques, but we observed many of these people smoking.</p>

        <p>We were also deeply saddened that this beautiful island has become the subject of contention among people who have their own agendas.</p>
