        <p>Dr. Laura Anne Hodes, a daughter of Dr. Cynthia Miller Hodes and Dr. David S. Hodes of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., was married there yesterday to Dr. Alan Walter Dove, a son of Sarah W. Griffith of Severna Park, Md. and Thomas L. Dove of Kent Island, Md. The Rev. Charles R. Colwell performed the ceremony at the Zion Episcopal Church.</p>
        <p>The bride, 28, graduated from Princeton University and received an M.D. degree last week from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. In June, she is to begin a residency in general surgery at Temple University Medical Center in Philadelphia. Her mother is a pediatrician at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. Her father is a medical director in Nutley, N.J., with Roche Laboratories and a former chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Mount Sinai.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 31, is a contributing writer in New York for Nature Biotechnology and Nature Medicine. He graduated from Towson State University and received a Ph.D. in microbiology from Columbia. His mother is an administrative assistant at Arinc Research, a designer of air-traffic control systems in Annapolis, Md. His father is a technical editor at Sail and Chesapeake Bay magazines.</p>
        <p>The couple met in December 1995 while attending a medical conference on viruses at Mount Sinai. Mr. Dove was a graduate student and Ms. Hodes was a research technician. ''I saw an empty seat,'' Ms. Hodes recalled, ''and the guy next to it was cute.'' Ms. Hodes and a female friend sat down. Bored, they began doodling in-jokes on their notepads.</p>
        <p>In molecular biology, there is an enzyme called BGL2, which is pronounced Bagel 2. Mr. Dove noticed the two doodling women, and when a speaker mentioned BGL2, Mr. Dove quickly drew on his own notepad a picture of twin bagels. Mutual admiration ensued.</p>
