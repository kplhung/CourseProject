        <p>Welcome to Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Matteo's: A Little Taste of Hoboken, in quiet Westwood, was founded 13 years ago by the late Matthew Jordan, a former trucker from the old neighborhood who wandered far but never lost the taste for Italian comfort food. The informal trattoria and take-out that sits next door to a more upscale dining room of the same name that was opened by Mr. Jordan 24 years earlier.</p>
        <p>Transplanted Jerseyites are frequent patrons, but Matteo's has developed a strong local customer base over the years, with entree prices that range from $7.95 to $14.95 in the cafe, and up to $24.95 next door.</p>
