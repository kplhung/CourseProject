        <p>WE at the Jersey column have just been informed that there is some kind of election going on this year -- indeed, a whole array of elections. We wish we had known about this earlier because it would have given us time to arrange to leave the country, but since we're stuck here it seems appropriate to pretend we are paying attention.</p>
        <p>We learned of these elections when we turned on our television the other day and stumbled upon a debate involving two Democrats who both want to be United States senators. What struck us about this debate was that we were not among the journalists invited to pose the questions. Just who is responsible for this oversight remains unclear, but we are going to correct it right now by using this space to ask the questions we would have asked had we been included.</p>

        <p>WE at the Jersey column have just been informed that there is some kind of election going on this year -- indeed, a whole array of elections. We wish we had known about this earlier because it would have given us time to arrange to leave the country, but since we're stuck here it seems appropriate to pretend we are paying attention.</p>
        <p>We learned of these elections when we turned on our television the other day and stumbled upon a debate involving two Democrats who both want to be United States senators. What struck us about this debate was that we were not among the journalists invited to pose the questions. Just who is responsible for this oversight remains unclear, but we are going to correct it right now by using this space to ask the questions we would have asked had we been included.</p>
        <p>These will not be boring questions about the things that are supposedly the hot issues of the day -- after careful study we have concluded that all candidates are deeply, sincerely concerned about education, Social Security, families, mom, apple pie, etc., and plan to do something about every one of those things if elected, although they aren't saying what. (Where, we want to know, are the candidates who are against better, safer schools and fairer, lower taxes? Where are the candidates who believe that the marriage tax penalty is not severe enough? Where are the candidates with the courage to tell senior citizens to take their crushing health care bills and go jump in a lake?)</p>
        <p>No, we are instead going to pose the irksome, insidious questions you encounter in everyday life, the ones that make you wonder whether Soupy Sales is perhaps running the universe. However, since we know the Senate candidates are too busy holding fund-raising breakfasts to take our phone calls, we are going to answer the questions using excerpts from their debates, shamelessly taking remarks out of context whenever we feel like it. We think the results will tell you everything you need to know to vote intelligently in next month's primaries.</p>
        <p>Q: Why is the radio station that my kid blares all day long, WPST (''Real music variety''), still playing Faith Hill's ''This Kiss'' even though the song is now two years old?</p>
        <p>Jon S. Corzine, Democrat: ''I didn't create this system. I will go and get it changed by working in the United States Senate to make sure that we open up the airwaves.''</p>
        <p>Q: How come whenever there's one of those humongous Big Game jackpots it's won by someone in the Midwest? Shouldn't the Midwesterners share the money with us and, specifically, with me?</p>
        <p>William L. Gormley, Republican: ''We have to stand up for New Jersey; we have to fight on a day-in and day-out basis to make sure that we get our fair share. We haven't been getting it, and it's time it started now.''</p>
        <p>James W. Treffinger, Republican, in rebuttal: ''I believe Montana is a lot different from New Jersey. The last thing I want are Montanans making laws for me here in New Jersey or, for that matter, me making laws for Montanans.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, in rebuttal: Elections are about a contest of ideas; they're not about money.</p>
        <p>Q: Anybody who's ever ridden a New Jersey Transit train knows that the crew spends far more time screaming ''Do not flip the seats!'' than it does driving the train. If flipping the seats is so morally wrong, why were the seats made flippable in the first place? Shouldn't the train crews just shut up and let people flip?</p>
        <p>Murray Sabrin, Republican: ''If we do that, then the problem goes away and we don't have to demonize inanimate objects.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gormley, in rebuttal: ''I think we have to be as tough as we can. This is not about the individual freedom of individuals. This is about protecting society as a whole from those who would destroy our children.''</p>
        <p>Q. I'm holding in my hand a bottle of Excedrin Extra Strength and a bottle of Excedrin Migraine -- two separate products, two separate advertising budgets, etc. Yet each has exactly the same active ingredients. What should be done about this?</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine: ''I think we ought to put people in jail without any possibility of parole.''</p>
        <p>Robert D. Franks, Republican, in rebuttal: ''More mandates from Washington, D.C., isn't the answer.''</p>
        <p>Q.: Why is the town that's east of New Brunswick called East Brunswick? Technically, shouldn't it be East New Brunswick?</p>
        <p>Jim Florio, Democrat, not only answering the question but also summing up this column: ''Rhetoric is rhetoric. Words are words. This is not bold, it's baloney.''</p>
