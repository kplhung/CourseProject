        <p>Following are excerpts from the address by Representative Rick A. Lazio announcing his candidacy for the United States Senate, as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>I have always believed that public service is a noble endeavor. As a prosecutor, as a neighbor, a local legislator, and as your congressman, I have worked hard to try to make our New York a better place. You can tell from my accent that I am a lifelong New Yorker. You see, I don't have to fake it. New York isn't just a place I represent; it is my home.  And I've never needed an exploratory committee to decide where I want to live. . . .</p>

        <p>Following are excerpts from the address by Representative Rick A. Lazio announcing his candidacy for the United States Senate, as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>I have always believed that public service is a noble endeavor. As a prosecutor, as a neighbor, a local legislator, and as your congressman, I have worked hard to try to make our New York a better place. You can tell from my accent that I am a lifelong New Yorker. You see, I don't have to fake it. New York isn't just a place I represent; it is my home.  And I've never needed an exploratory committee to decide where I want to live. . . .</p>
        <p>I'm no celebrity. In fact, you can just call me the underdog.  But here in New York, we love underdogs. And I am ready to work hard and to earn this job.</p>
        <p>I can't call on Air Force One whenever I need a ride. But New Yorkers can count on me and call on me when something needs to get done. I put on my Mets hat when I was 6 years old, and I've been working here ever since.  I've stacked mufflers at Linden Auto Parts on Montauk Highway.  I played Little League here, I've fished and clammed in our waters . . . prayed in our churches, I've married a wonderful native New Yorker and watched our two little girls come into this world in our local hospitals.</p>
        <p>I've helped lock up criminals in Suffolk County as an assistant district attorney. . . . And for eight years I've been a common sense voice for New York in the United States Congress. . . .</p>
        <p>I have a record I am proud of. It is a mainstream record that fits the thinking of the vast majority of people of our state. I'm a fiscal conservative who believes government spends too much and taxes too much. I believe that those of us who lived through the New York of the 1980's know all too well what happens when big government takes over and forces outdated liberal solutions upon our families and businesses.  Things stop working. People lose their jobs to other states. Opportunity quickly flees. Luckily for New York . . . New York has left big government behind and we have turned our state around. . . .</p>
        <p>The people of our state are looking for a candidate who has the experience and the vision to be a great senator on Day 1. . . .</p>
        <p>And so our campaign begins today. Our cause is just, and our message is true. Our path will be difficult, but if we work hard and persevere, I know we will succeed. And when we win, New York will win!</p>
