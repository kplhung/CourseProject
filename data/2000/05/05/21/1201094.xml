        <p>ANNIE BYAR could be any Princeton junior. She lives in campus housing with three other young women, has her meals at one of the university's eating clubs, and during finals makes midnight runs to the local Wawa convenience store to load up on snacks.</p>
        <p>But in one respect, Ms. Byar is unusual among the 1,134 juniors at Princeton University. For most of her 21 years, she did not attend public school or even a prestigious prep school that feeds into the Ivy League university.</p>
        <p>After years of lessons at the kitchen table at the hands of her mother and father, an industrial designer, a few community college courses and many extracurricular activities, Annie seamlessly joined the class of 2001. So far, she seems to be just as successful as her peers, who took the required courses and electives, sat through endless hours of study hall and went to the junior and senior prom.</p>
        <p>''I honestly don't think the transition was more difficult for me than other kids,'' said Ms. Byar. ''Socially there was no problem. I found a good group of friends right away. In some sense home schooling helped academically because I did so much on my own.''</p>
        <p>As home schooling gains in popularity in New Jersey and around the country -- it is now legal in every state -- there are a greater number of young adults entering college and the workplace who spent little or no time in traditional classrooms. Indeed, home schooling groups estimate that a million to 1.7 million children are being taught at home in the United States in the current school year; of that, about 200,000 are of high school age.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey -- as in several other states -- it is difficult to say how many children are learning at home because their parents are not required to register them with local school districts. But according to various home school groups, there are more than 20,000 children in New Jersey being taught at home.</p>
        <p>For some of the home-schooled students entering college, the step has been a huge one, filled with more than the usual amount of freshman jitters.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know where I'd fit in academically so I attacked my courses,'' said Lillian Pierce, a 19-year-old Princeton sophomore, who grew up in California and attended all but two years of school at home. Lillian, who is majoring in mathematics, received an award at the end of her freshman year for having the highest grade point average -- 4.23 -- in her class.</p>
        <p>Her experience, though certainly marked by more success than that of most home-schooled students, is very similar nonetheless.</p>
        <p>Many college students who were educated at home said that although they were anxious about the academics initially, they soon discovered that they were well prepared. In fact, most said they studied harder because they were not sure where they would stack up among their classmates.</p>
        <p>''I think it's been pretty easy,'' said Jesse Kafka, an 18-year-old freshman at the College of New Jersey in Ewing. ''The way I was educated helped me for college. If you're self-determined, home schooling is excellent, and I'm very self motivated.''</p>
        <p>Then there is Rebecca F. Holloway, 19, of Pitman, who recently completed her sophomore year at the Rutgers campus in Camden, where she is studying German and English. Rebecca did well enough in school testing that she was allowed to skip over the first two English composition courses and take Literary Masterpieces -- a higher level course -- in her first semester.</p>
        <p>''Academically I felt very prepared, especially in German,'' she said. ''I was nervous because I didn't know what to expect being with other students every day, but I really enjoy the campus. There's a lot of ethnic diversity and I've made a lot of friends.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, not every home-schooled student makes for a success story. Although the New Jersey Education Association does not keep statistics on home-schooled students, Lynn Maher, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Education Association, said she knows some students taught at home return to  public school after a while.</p>
        <p>While Ms. Maher said she respected the tremendous effort the parents put into educating their children, she questioned their ability to duplicate the social experience of public school.</p>
        <p>''The great, rich diversity of Americans they will be working with the rest of their lives'' can't be replicated at home, she said. ''This is not to say we don't appreciate the effort the parents make to socialize their children, but that's not a substitute for the public school experience. They are all selected activities. By being so selective they don't face any adversity or learn to appreciate the great range of human differences.''</p>
        <p>Annie Byar of Princeton said: ''From my perspective, the real key is parental involvement. ''I've seen kids whose parents don't put as much time and effort and the kids don't get as much out of it. I like to stress that this isn't for everyone.''</p>
        <p>For her part, Claire Fowler, a director of studies at  Princeton, said she had been impressed with the few home-schooled students she had met at the university. Ms. Fowler said they seemed less susceptible to grade comparisons and academic peer pressure than other students and sometimes even had an academic advantage because they had already learned to manage their time.</p>
        <p>''They can be extremely gifted and are very self-motivated,'' she said. ''They have learned to assess themselves, and they are not always worried about what the other person is doing.''</p>
        <p>Some of the most extensive research on home schooling has been conducted by the National Home Education Research Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Salem, Ore., run by Brian D. Ray, a former professor at Seattle Pacific University and Western Baptist College in Salem. Mr. Ray's studies have found that the number of home-schooled students has grown about 7 to 15 percent a year in the last decade.</p>
        <p>Despite the stark differences in their educational environment, home schoolers seem to fare about the same as their school-educated counterparts. When students completed home schooling, his study found, 69 percent went on to higher education and 31 percent looked for jobs, almost the same as students who graduated from public and private high schools.</p>
        <p>The College Board said it could not provide a breakdown of its test scores for home-schooled students. But Mr. Ray's institute said that in other standardized elementary and high school testing, students educated at home scored higher than the national norm of 50 percent -- although unlike public school pupils, not all home-schooled students were tested.</p>
        <p>In a survey by Mr. Ray of 1,926 home-educated students in the 1997 graduating class who took the American College Test (A.C.T.), the students scored an average of 23 in English as against the national average of 20.3, and 20.2 in math compared with the national average of 20.6.</p>
        <p>While appealing more and more to conventional families, home-schooling -- embraced anew in the past 10 to 15 years --  was rooted largely in the religious misgivings over the secularization of schools and the teaching of such subjects as evolution.</p>
        <p>While the institute said research showed that 86 percent of home schooling families identified themselves as Roman Catholic or some other Christian denomination and more than 90 percent were white, home-school organizations said those numbers were changing.</p>
        <p>There is also a more free-form kind of home schooling, called unschooling, which was first embraced by those who considered themselves part of the counterculture. And more and more, home schooling is appealing to a more conventional segment of society in which parents worry that their children are not getting enough individual attention in public school and are either more accelerated learners than their classmates or need remedial help in certain skills.</p>
        <p>For his part, William Lloyd, a researcher for the institute who is educating his children at home, said that he and 26 other families have formed a support group that meets periodically outside Washington, D.C. Mr. Lloyd said that among them are a Muslim family as well as several that are not at all religious.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't get as big a rise as it did five or six years ago when you say you are home schooling,'' Mr. Lloyd said.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, college students and adults say they still encounter the usual stereotypes about home schoolers -- largely that they are isolated and have not learned how to interact with strangers -- and feel they have to let people know that they were not locked in their houses for 12 years.</p>
        <p>''I had a professor say, 'How do you like being around people?' '' said Lillian Pierce, who began studying and playing violin at age 4 and appearing professionally by age 11. Because Lillian needed time to practice and to appear in concerts in Southern California and later in Europe, her parents taught her at home with the exception of the third and ninth grades.</p>
        <p>She met other children through music and ballet classes, she said, and never felt awkward socially, though she was somewhat nervous about how she would do academically in college.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pierce had taken relatively few exams until she was 16 and attending community college. Today she attacks tests as she does a violin concert -- to the extent that even her professors ask her how she does so well.</p>
        <p>''People are surprised by my attitude,'' she said. ''Exams are just like another performance. If you perform 90 percent at a concert, you walk out crying.''</p>
        <p>She attributed much of her academic success to her mother, whom she called ''the most natural teacher I've ever met.'' She was instructed from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. each day and studied five languages, including Latin.</p>
        <p>Still, though perhaps prepared academically, college can be ''some kind of a culture shock,'' for a student who has not been through a high school setting, said Ms. Fowler, the administrator at Princeton.</p>
        <p>Lee Stetson, the dean of admissions at the University of Pennsylvania, said there had been an increase in the number of applications from home-schooled students over the last 10 years. This year at Penn, there were 20 home-schooled students among the 19,000 applications received; of those, Mr. Stetson said 4 were among the 2,300 accepted, and at least 3 are expected to attend in the fall.</p>
        <p>He said the university looked at test scores, including the College Boards in specific subject areas, as well as strong letters of recommendations from adults, including ministers or rabbis.</p>
        <p>Home-school applicants usually send very impressive applications where they have put in a lot of time to show what they have done in and outside the classroom, Mr. Stetson said. ''Many of them work overtime to improve their portfolio,'' he said. ''There is no reason to believe that they won't be successful academically.''</p>
        <p>As home schooling becomes more commonplace -- and in many communities more organized with specialized classes teaching how to put together a college application -- post-secondary institutions are becoming more open to home-schooled students.</p>
        <p>''I think they are very open, and the better the school, the easier it was to break down the barriers,'' said Michael P. Farris, president of the 60,000-member Home School Legal Defense Association in Purcellville, Va., and chairman of the Madison Project, a political action committee that backs conservative Republican candidates.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Farris is the founder and president of Patrick Henry College, the nation's first post-secondary institution designed for home-schooled students and a training ground for Christian political advocates, which will take its first class of 100 students this fall.</p>
        <p>''This college is not being started because there is nowhere else to go,'' he said. The Evangelical Christian school, about an hour west of Washington, will offer six or seven major areas of study, including government, and teach classical subjects and ''values popular and commonplace among home schoolers,'' said Mr. Farris, himself the father of 10 home-schooled children.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farris takes offense at the notion that home-schooled students may be less exposed to the world than their publicly or privately educated peers. All home school students miss is ''the fake life'' of adolescents where they are influenced more by peers than family, he said. ''The illusion that home-school students are sheltered from the marketplace of ideas is a myth,'' he said. ''Most people who live in Manhattan are more sheltered than home-schooled kids. After 3 p.m., these families are like every other family in the country.''</p>
        <p>For 15 years, Mr. Farris coached girls' softball, and he said his teams usually included four or five home schoolers among the children from public and private schools. He said home schoolers also participated in science fairs, spelling bees, scouting and volunteer work. ''There's a desire to protect, but there's a difference between protection and isolation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ray's 1997 study found that 98 percent of the home-school students he surveyed said they were involved in two or more nonacademic activities. More than 80 percent said they played with people outside the family and went on field trips. Almost half participated in group sports and music classes as well as classes outside their homes.</p>
        <p>Ms. Byar, who attends Princeton, says the ''S'' word -- socialization -- is always brought up with home schoolers. In her case, she said, she had been captain of her area high school swim team and active in her church's youth group. In addition, she had taken some classes with groups of other home schoolers and had a graduation ceremony with six other students.</p>
        <p>''There's a misunderstanding of what home schooling really is,'' she said. ''There is a strong network of home schoolers. I made two of my best friends in classes and on field trips. I did not grow up isolated. That's a stereotype that is not true at all.''</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Byar says she is not sure that when the time comes she will choose to invest the same amount of effort and energy in her children that her mother put into her education.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Christy Shipe, 24, a daughter of Mr. Farris who has a 1-year-old child and a second child due this month, said she planned to educate all of her children at home because it worked out well for her. Ms. Shipe attended private school for kindergarten and first grade, and the rest of her education took place at home. She worked for a year after completing the 12th grade and then attended Cedarville College in Ohio, where she graduated with a 3.98 grade point average. Today she teaches piano at her home and runs a high school debate program called Home School Legal Defense Association. She said friends and neighbors were often surprised that she was educated at home because she was so  outgoing.</p>
        <p>''I love social settings and having people over,'' she said. ''A lot of people have a conception of what home schoolers are like. They are all totally normal people. You couldn't pick them out of a crowd.''</p>
        <p>In June, 18-year-old Joshua Donaldson of Hainesport will graduate with 14 other home school students in a local church, and each child and parent will speak or perform a musical presentation. Joshua, who scored almost 1400 on his College Boards, was accepted at four colleges. But he has decided to attend the College of New Jersey, studying chemistry and living at home.</p>
        <p>''Every college I talked to has been very positive,'' Joshua said. But he said he finally decided to go to a school where he could commute from home and spend time with his younger brothers and two recently adopted 2-year-old sisters from India.</p>
        <p>''I appreciate the fact that I'm in a little bit of a bubble here,'' he said. ''Being out in it every day will be a transition for me. I want to come home. It's really a haven.''</p>
