        <p>To the Editor: Approaching the final leg of our homeward journey from Jamaica and Belize, my husband and I found ourselves stranded with thousands of people in Miami International Airport because of inclement weather. We approached the two-night and one-day delay as an opportunity. I remembered that we had purchased travel insurance. I called CSA's 24-hour emergency hot line, and learned that ''delays over 12 hours will be compensated up to $1,500 for reasonable accommodation and transportation expenses.''</p>
        <p>We rented a Ford Explorer, chewed sticky Cinnabons (a favorite airport treat), and found ourselves a boutique hotel at a midweek bargain on South Beach's chic Ocean Drive.</p>

        <p>CSA sent us a refund for 100 percent of our submitted receipts for car rental, hotel, parking and meals.</p>
