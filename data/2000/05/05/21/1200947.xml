        <p>Profits and Principles</p>
        <p>Global Capitalism and</p>
        <p>Human Rights in China.</p>
        <p>By Michael A. Santoro.</p>
        <p>241 pp. Ithaca, N.Y.:</p>
        <p>Cornell University Press. $29.95.</p>
        <p>Who could have imagined that so wonkish a subject as trade with China would turn into the kind of overheated political issue that, like abortion and gun control, splits people into noisy warring camps? Lines have been drawn in the sand, with choices reduced to stark either-ors: human rights or expanded commerce, worker protection or globalization. But to anyone looking for reasoned discussion instead of rhetorical posturing, Michael A. Santoro's ''Profits and Principles'' is a fine place to start. Santoro, who teaches at the Rutgers Graduate School of Management, has been visiting China every year for nearly a decade. He has spoken with hundreds of businessmen, workers, government officials and human rights advocates inside and outside China. The stiffness of his prose will doubtless limit his readership, but his solidly grounded analysis deserves a wide audience.</p>
        <p>Santoro begins with a valuable distinction. American companies doing business in China can be broadly divided into two types: those seeking to expand their operations by establishing themselves in the increasingly lucrative Chinese market, and those in a global marketplace wishing to reduce their production costs by taking advantage of the country's low-wage labor. The first group makes a firm, long-term commitment to China. Motorola, for instance, has invested more than $1.5 billion in state-of-the-art facilities. Santoro reports that the company's Tianjin plant, which employs about 10,000 workers, is ''spacious, clean and well lit.'' None of the workers ''appear to be in the least bit haggard or oppressed.'' It is, he concludes, ''a place that a young graduate of Purdue, North Carolina State or Cal Tech would find congenial.''</p>
        <p>The businesses of the second group, on the other hand, are responsible for the sweatshop image that dominates American notions of Chinese workplaces. They tend to be in low-tech, labor-intensive, cutthroat industries like apparel and toys, where the economic pressures are constantly downward. In their ''race to the bottom,'' these companies (or, more often, their local subcontractors) provide the lowest possible wages in the grimmest possible conditions.</p>
        <p>Santoro's distinction immediately complicates the human rights question. The first group, the market builders, are improving human rights in China, he points out, simply through their presence there. They are changing their workers' values by teaching individual initiative. Outside the factory, they foster a business environment that adheres to rule by law. Perhaps most important, they are creating a meritocratic middle class with a power base independent of the Communist Party. The market builders, Santoro says, are ''doing good while doing well.''</p>
        <p>It is among the second group that the human rights problem is most acute. After reviewing proposals for voluntary regulation, Santoro urges the World Trade Organization to adopt an enforceable code of international labor standards. His impulse is honorable, but one wishes he had been tougher-minded.</p>
        <p>Santoro notes that third world governments consistently oppose international codes -- not because they are eager to exploit their own citizens but because they see the codes as a kind of hidden protectionism: if wage, health and safety standards are set too high, these countries lose their comparative advantage. As usual with such matters, the Chinese present the most dramatic illustration of the issue. It is estimated that China will have to create 18 million jobs each year for the foreseeable future simply to stay where it is. In a Malthusian world where millions of Chinese are faced with the alternative of jobless desperation or employment under what the West considers sweatshop conditions, the sweatshops win every time. Attempting to define wage and safety levels that are not so high as to jeopardize job opportunities for people already living at the edge -- and to do so under a system of fluctuating exchange rates -- is a task to try the capacities of even the wisest of men, women and computers. Just how many Solomons are there at the W.T.O. anyway?</p>
