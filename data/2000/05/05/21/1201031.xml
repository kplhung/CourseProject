        <p>THE black and white newsprint pictures looked like oversize ''wanted'' posters hanging on the wall of the Vaclav Spala Gallery on Narodni Trida, a main shopping street here. In fact, that's exactly what they were intended to be. The show, called the ''Gallery of Established Nomenklatura'' (''G.E.N.'') and subtitled ''Malik Urvi'' (a play on the Czech words for ''Little Whores''), was a set of three-foot-tall mug shots and potted biographies of Czechs -- some prominent, some less so -- whose careers first bloomed when they were members of the Communist Party during the country's 42 years of totalitarian rule.</p>
        <p>The exhibition, which was on view in January, was magnetic. Thousands of people who ordinarily walk right past the contemporary art shows at Spala, one of Prague's leading galleries, stopped in to take a look. They tut-tutted their way through the show's two floors and 34 mug shots.</p>
        <p>In the dark days of Communist rule, much art was political. The Communists paid many artists salaries and consistently bought the work of many others who either supported the regime or did nothing to upset it. Other art was political either in open protest against Communism and its values or in a sullen and silent refusal to let art be used for any political end.</p>
        <p>Dissident art with an overt political message peaked in the late 1970's and the 1980's but vanished almost overnight when the velvet revolution of 1989 overthrew the country's Communist rulers. For most of the next decade, contemporary art became largely apolitical.</p>
        <p>But with ''G.E.N.'' and a handful of other exhibits in the last year, political art seems to be making a comeback in the Czech Republic, largely because the new government has failed to deliver on promises of creating a prosperous country on the cinders of Communism.</p>
        <p>''After 1989, many people turned to nonpolitical art,'' said Jakub Patocka, editor of the newspaper Literarny Noviny. ''They said, 'We are fed up with politics, and we have to be purely aesthetic.' What we are seeing now is a quite natural development as the aesthetic and the political become more balanced.''</p>
        <p>The creators of ''G.E.N.'' were an ad hoc group of 30-ish former students at Prague's Academy of Applied Arts who call themselves Pode Bal, a name that was taken from a quip by Marcel Duchamp and that could be politely translated as ''take a hike.'' Pode Bal's members came of age in the last years of Communism, and say their art is part of a continuing struggle against the traces Communism has left in Czech society.</p>
        <p>''The point of all our exhibitions is to provoke a dialogue about things we think are important,'' said one member, Petr Motycka. ''During Communism, responsibility for everything was always assigned to some abstract entity somewhere that was really no one at all. And this is what we are trying to reverse.''</p>
        <p>In particular, Pode Bal members are upset that a decade after the fall of Communism, many of the country's wealthiest and most powerful people owe much of their success to old-boy networks and privileges earned as loyal party members or collaborators.</p>
        <p>''I don't want the Communists and secret police agents to represent me,'' said Michal Siml, a graphics designer and Pode Bal member. ''They served a criminal regime. The force of our art is that when things are known in society but nothing is done about them, we compress them into a small space and provoke people to do something about it.''</p>
        <p>Their detractors say Pode Bal's members are merely modern purveyors of agitprop, the Soviet art of using propaganda and the visual arts to agitate the masses. Pavel Liska, a curator, wrote in the art magazine Umelec: ''Pode Bal's project is a naive, if not downright juvenile, continuation of something that has long ceased to exist -- cultural dissent. If it's politics, make it politics. If it's art, then make it art. Art should not be put at the disposal of some political parties to help their propaganda.''</p>
        <p>The minister of industry, Miroslav Gregr, a former Communist Party member, has threatened to sue Pode Bal and demanded an apology. The foreign minister, Jan Kavan, who is accused of being a secret police collaborator in the biography accompanying his ''G.E.N.'' mug shot, has been cleared by a court of any hint of collaborating with the secret police. He says it is sad that the artists resorted to such tactics.</p>
        <p>Judging from both the popular response and from the project itself, Pode Bal's work may well be more propaganda than art, but the group is plowing fertile ground. Ten years after the fall of Communism, Czechs are increasingly angry at their country's political and economic situation. The economy long ago stopped growing; racism and intolerance are rising; corruption seems to have invaded every corner of daily life; and there is a popular perception that rampant crony capitalism has left the little man out in the cold.</p>
        <p>President Vaclav Havel says the country is experiencing a ''national foul mood,'' and like many others, he blames a former prime minister, Vaclav Klaus, for uncorking a potent mixture of extreme free market ideology, corruption and a decidedly unfree-market desire by the government to hold on to the reins of political and economic power.</p>
        <p>But the Czech brand of anything-goes capitalism failed to make people rich, and amid growing frustration with conventional politics, two significant grass roots reform campaigns have started in recent months calling for people to take a more active role in politics. Artists, too, are getting into the act.</p>
        <p>David Cerny, another 30-ish artist but not a member of Pode Bal, says it is impossible not to be political in his art. Mr. Cerny, who is known as something of a prankster, came to fame in 1990 when he painted pink a Soviet tank that had stood as a memorial to the Red Army's liberation of Prague in 1945. In November, Mr. Cerny satirized one of the country's most cherished national monuments, a massive bronze of the Czechs' patron saint, Good King Wenceslas, sitting on his horse in the heart of the capital. Mr. Cerny's St. Wenceslas, carved from polyurethane, was suspended at the opposite end of Wenceslas Square astride an upside-down horse, whose tongue hung limply from its mouth. The sculpture, he said, was ''a cry for help.''</p>
        <p>''This was a kind of proclamation,'' he said. ''The horse is dead and the state of the country is pretty terrible. We are in a very similar situation to Bolshevism, where the people with power think they have unlimited power.'' That, he says, is why artists have a responsibility to get involved: ''If art doesn't change anything, it's useless.''</p>
        <p>His statement might well sum up Pode Bal's approach. Its earlier exhibits included ''T.G.M. Fried Chicken,'' which meant to show how Communism had been quickly supplanted by consumerism, which many people took for a modern version of the humanist vision that defined Czechoslovakia under its legendary founder and first president, Tomas Garrigue Masaryk -- who is known by his initials T.G.M. and who bears a passing resemblance to Colonel Sanders.</p>
        <p>An exhibit in the Czech parliament building to protest new drug laws parodied advertisements for Johnnie Walker, Chivas Regal and other legal stimulants. A skewered Marlboro ad featuring a hookah-smoking man bore the legend: ''Pode Bal warns that smoking nonstate-owned drugs can damage your freedom.''</p>
        <p>Even those who agree that the time is right for political art think Pode Bal's methods may not be the best. '' 'Malik Urvi' is the art of these kind of anti-Communists who showed the same hate the Communists showed when they were denouncing people,'' said Mr. Patocka, the editor. ''The only thing missing is their addresses.''</p>
        <p>Still, a wave of political art is not about to be unleashed on the country. Radek Vana, a former curator of contemporary art at the National Gallery here, warns that many young artists shy away from politics. ''It's not cool to be involved with politics,'' he said, ''and it's difficult to make a statement. They think politics is dirty. Also, there's this idea that art should be timeless. I think some of them feel that there's too much fun around.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''Critical reflection in general is lacking in Czech art. It's really an exception when people reflect the condition of their living in their art here.''</p>
        <p>Marketa Othova, a highly regarded photographer who is featured in this year's Carnegie International art forum, says that for her it's not a question of ''cool'' or ''uncool,'' or of indifference to the fate of the world. It's just that Pode Bal's kind of party politics, she says, has no place in her art.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to be a political animal,'' she said. ''For me, the important thing is freedom. I joined the revolution at school, and since I've been free, I don't worry about these things.''</p>
        <p>Yet even those who do use their art to make a political statement, said Mr. Vana, do not bite very hard on the hand that feeds them.</p>
        <p>''My problem with Pode Bal is that it wasn't really art,'' he said. ''The people in the gallery didn't come for art; they came for information. So why put design there -- just put information.''</p>
