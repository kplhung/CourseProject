        <p>CROCODILE SOUP</p>
        <p>By Julia Darling.</p>
        <p>351 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>The Ecco Press. $25.</p>
        <p>IF I were single, I'd want to be single in England. The British seem to have a benign tolerance toward the off kilter that we don't, not to mention a whole adjectival vocabulary (dotty, balmy, loopy) for the solitary tics of the maiden aunt or the Latin tutor with bad teeth. Julia Darling's first novel, ''Crocodile Soup,'' is a droll portrait of one such ''lost English eccentric.'' Quite possibly, you cannot even be droll without English citizenship. But Darling's understated, urbane humor survives the trans-Atlantic voyage.</p>
        <p>Frumpy, dour Gertrude Hardcastle, 35, catalogs artifacts in the basement of an archaeological museum in a small northern city. The museum is about to be modernized by a gung-ho new director, and Gert, an artifact herself, fears for her job. A self-described ''haunted lesbian,'' Gert nurses a crush on Eva, who works in the museum cafeteria, and avoids answering a series of increasingly desperate letters from her estranged mother.</p>
        <p>If Gert is ''finding it hard to endure everyday life,'' it's not too surprising, given her childhood. Her father trotted off for a while to run Uncle Willy's crocodile farm in West Africa. Her spacey, gin-besotted mother neglected her; preferred Gert's twin brother, Frank; and relegated her to an attic bedroom where the sullen, bed-wetting child was so terrified that she required the services of a psychiatrist specializing in bad-dream exorcisms.</p>
        <p>Disaster-prone, the toddler Gert not only managed to get lost at the zoo but found herself in the crocodile's cage. She attracted flashers. But that's just the beginning. ''By the time I was 8 years old,'' Gert says, ''I had already been haunted, nearly eaten by a crocodile, maimed my mother, murdered an au pair girl. . . . No wonder I was a nervous type. You might think that was quite enough for one childhood, but there is more calamity to endure, and I don't see why I should let you off the hook.''</p>
        <p>''Crocodile Soup'' is related in Gert's own scaly, sharp-fanged voice. Darling succeeds in having her narrator come off as wry rather than whiny. Part of the fun of the novel is trying to determine exactly how awful Gert's childhood really was, since many of the jumpiest, jauntiest bits recall girlhood's standard humiliations.</p>
        <p>Gert suffers through the oppressive school, the piano lessons, the ballet lessons with ''an aging woman called Miss Palms in a heavyweight tweed suit, who was lame in one leg and who tapped time with a thorny stick.'' Later Gert experiences the terror of first menstruation when she receives the standard kit from her mother, with ''wads of white pads that looked like they were designed to bandage war wounds.'' She has a grim make-out session with a boy in a movie theater. The fact that the movie they're seeing is ''The Exorcist'' is a charming touch. ''I fiddled lethargically in his pants. It was like putting my hand into a bowl of warm bananas.''</p>
        <p>The novel abounds with such juicy similes. They're the crocodile parts in the soup of Gert's memories. In snappy chapters, she reminisces about the traumas, major and minor, that have shaped her into a sour introvert given to ''panic attacks the size of Egypt.'' Since the novel is hardly long on plot (there's a stolen mummy at the museum, and the mystery of why the cleaning staff at</p>
        <p>the psychiatric hospital behind Gert's apartment is dumping bags into her trash), it can be read more as a tone poem than a page turner.</p>
        <p>Most of the men in ''Crocodile Soup'' are just slightly to the right of certifiable -- except for Gert's twin, who is actually institutionalized. A nameless artist meets the teenage Gert in the park and slips her acid. Her tutor, Mr. Berry, barely functions, and Harry, the guard at the hospital, is as ''lonely as an isolated virus.'' Her father sets off in a boat named after a long-departed nanny and does not return. No wonder Gert craves the warm, more grounded Eva, who is capable of doing ordinary things like clothes shopping. Eva is unrepentantly heterosexual, but Gert figures this might prove to be only a minor hurdle.</p>
        <p>GERT'S short-lived career as a lesbian separatist is one of the novel's wittiest set pieces. ''I must be the only person in the world who came out before I even came in,'' she admits. Gert has known she was gay since first glimpsing Dusty Springfield and has mystical memories of a girl in gym class. But her sexual orientation, she claims, is solidly rooted in her relationship with her mother, who treated her with scorn and neglect.</p>
        <p>As for how Gert transformed herself from a shy, plain girl, lonely as a mummy, to a leather-jacketed, swaggering adult who goes heavy on the hair gel to serially pick up women at bars, the novel does not make quite clear. Presumably Eva is a turning point in Gert's interest in commitment. But ''Crocodile Soup'' spends so much time in reminiscence that the chronology of Gert's emotional growth gets a bit lost. The resolution -- in which Gert finds true love and reconciles with her mother -- feels abrupt and somewhat unconvincing. Still, with her feisty bad humor, Gert Hardcastle makes excellent company: a maiden aunt for the 21st century.</p>
        <p>Lisa Zeidner's most recent novel is ''Layover.'' She is the director of the graduate writing program at Rutgers University in Camden, N.J.</p>
