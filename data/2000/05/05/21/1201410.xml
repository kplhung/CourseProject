        <p>You want to give him a dignified ending, offer him a cigarette and tell him how courageously he and his men fought. Pat Riley stares at you in disdain.</p>
        <p>He knows what this is about and wants no sympathy. Before it is over, he will envision triumph and tragedy. He will even use those words. As long as two weeks ago, when the struggle began, he knew this would happen: Game 7 against the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''Absolute madness,'' Riley called Game 6, minutes after Madison Square Garden stopped shaking, the Heat having squandered a 15-point lead in the second half. He referred to the rivalry as ''one big death grip that both teams have on the other.''</p>
        <p>Moments before, he had taken that long, hard walk through the tunnel, down a corridor and into the locker room of his crestfallen team.</p>
        <p>His head was slightly bowed after a 72-70 loss that tied the series at three games apiece, yet the cameras caught something revealing: a wry smile. He did not have a hollow, end-of-the-world look about him. Nor did he have a deathly pallor that suggested he had had it with this maddening game and this opponent he could not quite slay to free himself from emotional torment. ''My only request on the flight back home was that they stay away from the thought of last night's game,'' he said yesterday. ''Get it out of your mind. We went to close out a very proud team. We let it slip away.''</p>
        <p>You begin to realize this is who he is, this is what he does. The annual morality play at the Garden, the struggle to make the jeering crowd accept and love him. And the crucible of the fight, even the bitter end. Sport, distilled by a coach, as life.</p>
        <p>One wonders if Riley does not revel in the moment, basking in the pain, as much as he is devastated by losing. Riley secretly enjoying every minute of the late-game breakdown.</p>
        <p>It was this way in New York, when Reggie Miller shot the Knicks down in Game 1 of their 1995 epic, Riley's last series on the Knick sideline. It was this way in Game 5 last year and in 1998, that sinking feeling that his best shot was not good enough, that he had to start all over again and use the pain as motivation.</p>
        <p>Because if it hurts this much to lose, it must feel even more euphoric to win. Who else would use ''preordained'' and ''destiny'' in basketball? Who else would appear more haggard and battered after a tough victory in Game 5 than after an absolutely surreal collapse in Game 6. Who else refers to the rookie Anthony Carter as a man ''who doesn't have the wounds and scars of the others''?</p>
        <p>Riles, with the battle of Carthage on his mind.</p>
        <p>In 1966 he played for Adolph Rupp's Kentucky Wildcats, the all-white team that lost the national championship to Texas Western, which had five black starters, an event that transcended basketball. Whether you think his omnipotent coaching methods run closer to amateur brain-washing than sincere motivational tactics does not matter.</p>
        <p>Riley believes. Therefore, his players do. He will walk into his own building today, in front of 20,000 people who in their hearts cannot fathom the Heat's beating the Knicks in a deciding game. For two seasons running, Riley has endured his former employer's ending the Heat's season.</p>
        <p>Knick fans will engulf the American Airlines Arena, the enemy invading his home. Riley knows that they're coming, that they'll be loud and intense, just as he knows that this series can again come down to one bounce, one shot, one second of desire that either validates his stature as one of the greatest coaches in team sports or punctures the myth for the third straight year. The reality lies somewhere in between.</p>
        <p>He has turned players who should be yelling ''We got next'' at community center courts into solid National Basketball Association veterans. Riley has done so much with so little since he left Magic and Kareem and the Showtime Lakers that to assail his coaching ability for not winning a title since 1988 is ludicrous.</p>
        <p>But he also stays with the same group of role players too long, stubbornly believing their hearts can compensate for anything they lack in talent. A part of you actually admires his faith, the idea that he believes he can beat you with people who simply try harder, regardless of the weapons at their disposal.</p>
        <p>Riley rented out a theater in Boca Raton, Fla., while his players were preparing for the Knicks. Together, they watched the World War II submarine movie ''U-571,'' and he made parallels about the movie and his team. But ''Gladiator'' is more apropos to his own struggle playing now.</p>
        <p>In that film, the character played by Russell Crowe gallantly commands the Roman Empire army until the new Caesar tries to have him assassinated. He winds up in a faraway land and essentially needs to kill other men for the crowd's pleasure to win his own freedom. He fights his way back to Rome, to the original Coliseum, and faces off against his mortal enemies, who just happen to be his former employers. We won't ruin the end for you. It's on NBC today at 3:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>Russell Crowe's wardrobe has been upgraded to Armani.</p>
