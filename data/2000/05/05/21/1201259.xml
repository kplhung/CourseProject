        <p>IN 2000, volatility has turned into a four-letter word.</p>
        <p>After becoming steadily more variable over the last five years, stock prices have reached a whole new level of instability this year. The Nasdaq composite now routinely rises or falls 3 percent in a session. That used to be rare: from 1971, when the Nasdaq was created, through1997, there were only 40 days with moves of 3 percent or more. In 1998 and 1999, there were a total of 35. In the four and a half months since Jan. 1, there have been 34.</p>
        <p>Many professional traders and money managers view the new volatility as an ominous sign, directly connected to the rise in day trading. With trading costs falling, chat rooms spreading rumors and securities markets fragmenting into competing electronic networks, it is no wonder prices swing wildly, they say. And that should worry even people who are not CNBC habitues.</p>
        <p>''When intraday volatility is high, people lose confidence in the meaning of price,'' said Robert Schwartz, professor of finance at Baruch College.</p>
        <p>But not so fast.</p>
        <p>There may be a more benign explanation for the rise in volatility, said Greg Duffee, a professor at the business school of the University of California at Berkeley and a former researcher for the Federal Reserve. Understanding it requires a short primer on efficient market theory, which luckily is not as dry as it sounds.</p>
        <p>In its most rigorous (and absurd) form, efficient market theory says investors can never beat the market except through luck, because stocks are always properly valued based on the information available to investors. So stocks should rise and fall only in response to new data. Company X reports earnings that are lower than expected; Company X's stock falls. Company Y announces a new biotechnology breakthrough; Company Y's shares rise.</p>
        <p>Of course, in the real world, efficient market theory has lots of holes. An investor who researched Company X thoroughly might anticipate those ''lower than expected'' earnings. A biotechnology expert might see Company Y's breakthrough coming before other investors do. But efficient market theorists regard those cases as rare. And few serious investors disagree with the theory's practical implication that it is very difficult to beat the market over long periods.</p>
        <p>So never mind the day traders, and forget fragmentation. Volatility may be rising simply because investors must digest more information every day. With product cycles shortening, with breakthroughs every week in technology and biotechnology, no one should be surprised that share prices are bouncing all over, Mr. Duffee said.</p>
        <p>If the day-trader theory were right, he said, there would be telltale statistical evidence. ''Imagine it's just more trading that's causing more price changes, and not more information,'' he said. ''Then people are just pushing prices, and you're going to see a lot of negative serial correlation'' -- what went up on Monday comes down on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Duffee conceded that the Nasdaq has taken just that kind of round trip in the last six months, from 3,500 to 5,000 and back, he said thorough analysis over longer periods found no such oscillating trend.</p>
        <p>''Your eyes can't determine statistical significance,'' Mr. Duffee said. ''I'm not saying markets are efficient. I'm saying, if they were inefficient in this way, it would be really easy to make a boatload of money.'' And whenever that's true on Wall Street, someone steps in to make it -- and the inefficiency disappears.</p>
        <p>For the clincher, Mr. Duffee said, look back at past occasions when trading volume rose sharply. The best example came in 1975, when brokers were forced to compete on commissions for the first time. ''Trading just exploded,'' he said. ''Volatility didn't.''</p>
