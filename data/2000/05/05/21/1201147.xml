        <p>The screwdrivers are strong  and the gimlets agreeable at Pierrot, an East Village bistro, but visitors are less besotted by the cocktails than by the bar stools, which are made from John Deere tractor seats. ''They're a popular topic of conversation,'' Brian White, Pierrot's owner, said of the humped, 18-gauge steel seats. ''Although women like them a lot more than men.'' (It's that hump.) Bob Perry, who designed the seats, is fond of using farm and garden equipment in his work. He has constructed stools made from shovels for the Malaysian restaurant Penang in SoHo.</p>
        <p>Jennifer Rubell, co-owner of Rubell Hotels, is also jumping on the farm wagon, having just redesigned her New York apartment as an ''urban farmhouse'' filled with cogs, apple crates, canning equipment and milk cans. Ms. Rubell said that she planned to get a tractor for her living room, and also to do a farm-theme hotel.</p>

        <p>If the hotel's bar ends up with tractor seats, Ted Blew, a hog farmer from Pittstown, N.J., offered advice on how to help men get over the hump. He said, ''If they want the tractor seats to be comfortable, they should put foot rests in the bar itself, so guys can lean back and redistribute their weight.''</p>
