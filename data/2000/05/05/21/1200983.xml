        <p>There is a new and more upbeat spirit in the old town of Brussels, and it is not just because the city is one of Europe's nine Cities of Culture in this millennium year.</p>
        <p>One reason is the new, right-of-center government, more spirited and outspoken on the national and international stage than its weary predecessor. Another is the ongoing beautification of Brussels. Sidewalks have been repaved, and flowers and trees planted in profusion.</p>
        <p>But the principal reason is probably a young woman named Mathilde who was totally unknown until last fall, when she was unveiled as Crown Prince Philippe's fiancee. A young lady of great poise and charm, a commoner with a flashing smile and, most important, the ability to converse with the populace in both French and Flemish, the two languages of this divided country, she married the rather lackluster prince last December. In so doing, she not only polished up his image but restored the royal family to a position where it can, perhaps, again play a role as a symbol of national unity.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>The city has planned a cornucopia of cultural events -- 500 or more. For an overview, contact the Brussels 2000 information center at 50, rue de l'Ecuyer, Brussels 1000, (32-2) 278-2000, or at www.brussels2000.org; closed Monday.</p>
        <p>Brussels' 300-year-old opera house, La Monnaie, has moved all its workshops and rehearsal spaces into a handsome 1930's building behind the theater. This is also the location for an imaginative and evocative exposition, ''Un Chant d'Etoiles.'' Contemporary paintings and photographs of the universe, racks of costumes, videos of rehearsals and performances and ever-present distant music contribute to an illusion of being present backstage at the birth of a performance. And there's a wonderful working scale model of a Baroque opera house in Bayreuth, circa 1746. Until July 2 at 23, rue Leopold,  open daily except Monday noon to 6 p.m. Admission $5.70. Guided tours in English on weekends; reservations recommended; (32-2) 210-8558.</p>
        <p>One of the year's most popular events, the Bal Moderne, has been staged every Friday since February  in a different borough, and it will continue through June. At each ball, teams of choreographers teach the participants, ranging from age 10 to 70 and from every walk of life, to perform swing or a Latin American dance number, and smiles grow wider as confidence grows and the evening progresses. With or without a partner, this is a great way to see the Bruxellois at play. Admission is $5.70. Information: (32-2) 343-5000.</p>
        <p>The Rosas, the opera choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker's group, joins forces with actors from the STAN theater collective and musicians from Aka Moon's jazz group for the world premiere of  ''In Real Time,'' performed mostly in English, at Rosas Studio, 164, avenue Van Volxem, May 24 to 27 at 8:30 p.m. Tickets, $32, $18 and $11. Reservations: (32-70) 222-199.</p>
        <p>A premiere will also be given for  ''Grand Carrousel,'' a recreation of  the equestrian games of the early 18th century, featuring horses with lavishly costumed riders executing intricately choreographed maneuvers to Baroque music. The outdoor performances will take place in the former Caserne Prince Albert, adjoining the Petit Sablon. Performances at 9:30 p.m. June 1 to 3 and 6 to 9. $21.60 to $13.75; (32-70) 222-007.</p>
        <p>For pomp and circumstance, no  event can match the annual Ommegang, staged in the highly theatrical setting of the Grand-Place. It is a near-perfect copy of a 1549 procession in honor of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, born and raised in Belgium. The magnificently dressed lords and ladies of the court are portrayed by aristocrats, some playing the roles of their forebears. There is also lots of entertainment including flame throwers, acrobats, stilt walkers, archers and Breughelian dancers. July 4 and 6 at 9 p.m. Tickets for grandstand seats, $18 to $34, can be ordered from the Ommegang, 180, rue des Tanneurs; (32-2) 512-1961, fax (32-2) 502-6835.</p>
        <p>The hosts of this year's European  Soccer Championships are Belgium and the Netherlands. Kickoff is June 10, with Belgium playing Sweden at Brussels' Roi Baudouin Stadium. Four more matches, including one of the semifinals on June 29, will be played at the stadium. For ticket information visit www.euro2000.org.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>In conjunction with Brussels 2000, a number of theme tours, including those exploring city parks, examples of Art Nouveau, the city by boat and public spaces, are being arranged, by foot, bus, boat and bike. English-language tours are scheduled for May 27, June 4, June 10 and July 9. Tickets from $5.70 to $11.40. Details from Brussels 2000 (see above).</p>
        <p>The new Musical Instruments Museum (M.I.M.) will shortly open its vast collections in an extravagant Art Nouveau building from 1899, originally designed for the Old England department store. From here you enter the adjoining building, where 1,400 instruments from all over the world are to be displayed. When you approach one, you hear music featuring that instrument, thanks to headphones equipped with an infrared device. Belgium's Adolphe Sax, inventor of the saxophone, is well represented by that family along with oddities like a trombone with seven bells. There will be concerts every Thursday night in the 200-seat auditorium: classical music on original instruments as well as folk and world music. From the sixth-floor restaurant, with huge semicircular Art Nouveau windows, there is a panoramic view of Brussels. 2, rue Montagne de la Cour (off the Place Royale), (32-2) 545-0130. Opening June 10, then open daily (except Monday) 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (weekends from 10 a.m.; Thursday until 8 p.m., followed by a concert). Admission $3.40.</p>
        <p>The Cathedral of St.-Michel and Ste.-Gudule (20, place Ste.-Gudule), recently reopened, has never looked better. If you approach it from the winding streets of the old city, it suddenly looms above you, a heavenly apparition in pure white Gothic stonework. Until Sept. 20, the interior will be enhanced by 18 extraordinary high-warp tapestries, loomed in Brussels 500 years ago and on loan from the Spanish Crown. Tickets at the cathedral's ticket office, open Monday to Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.;  Saturday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; Sunday, 2 to 7 p.m. $6.80. (Guided tours in English on weekdays.)</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>Reduced rates given in parentheses apply on weekends and mid-July to the end of August.</p>
        <p>Le Dix-septieme, 25, rue de la Madeleine, (32-2) 502-5744, fax (32-2)  502-6424, in a 17th-century house is a tasteful haven. The 30 rooms, all different, feature wooden floors, Oriental carpets, exposed beams. Excellent service. Doubles start at $160 ($147), buffet breakfast included.</p>
        <p>Manos Residence, 102, Chaussee de Charleroi, (32-2) 537-9682, fax (32-2) 539-3655), consists of two art-filled town houses. Nine of the 38 rooms are reached by a spiral staircase to the fourth floor (which connects with the other, elevator-equipped section). The breakfast room and bar open onto extensive gardens. Doubles with bath cost $188 ($91); suites are a bargain at $308 ($148).</p>
        <p>Budget: Hotel Welcome, 5, rue du Peuplier, (32-2) 219-9546, fax (32-2) 217-1887, proudly claims to be Brussels' smallest hotel, but the six rooms offer most of what anyone might need, including king-size beds. The small inconveniences (no elevator) are made up for by the youthful enthusiasm of the owners, Michel and Sophie Smeesters. Breakfast room and restaurant. Doubles from $59 to $93 (no weekend rates).</p>
        <p>The Galia, 15-16, place du Jeu du Balle, (32-2) 502-4243, (32-2) 502-7619, right on the flea market, is not for the faint-hearted but has its own kind of jaunty charm. The elevator is slow but gets you there, and the 24 rooms are small but all have showers. There's a lively, skylighted tavern behind the reception. Doubles from $43 to $64 (no weekend rates).</p>
        <p>Luxury: Le Meridien, 3, Carrefour de l'Europe, (32-2) 548-4211, fax (32-2) 548-4080, has an undeniable Parisian chic, reflected in the smartness of the 224 red, green or blue rooms, the round marble lobby with its chandelier, and the restaurant, l'Epicerie, whose Mediterranean-flavored cuisine matches the colorful Limoges china. Doubles cost $318 ($116), not including breakfast.</p>
        <p>Radisson SAS, 47, rue du Fosse-aux Loups, (32-2) 219-2828, fax (32-2) 219-6262, has a young, can-do spirit, and the 281 spic-and-span rooms come in four styles. The greenery-filled atrium is a pleasant oasis, and the Sea Grill restaurant, one of Brussels' best, with two Michelin stars, will close July 21 until Aug. 15 for renovations. Doubles from $295 ($134).</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>Unless otherwise indicated, restaurants are closed Saturday at lunch time and Sunday, and for two weeks in July or August.</p>
        <p>Le Bistrot du Mail, 81, rue du Mail, (32-2) 539-0697, is a cozy, casual  place with ox-blood red walls where most of the clientele are regulars. Diners generally stray in late, 9 to 9:30 p.m. We loved the sea scallops with caramelized endives, the roast turbot with asparagus and potatoes crushed in olive oil, and lamb from the Pyrenees. Lunchtime regulars go for the plat du jour at $7.85. Dinner for two with wine about $90.</p>
        <p>Le Passage, 13, avenue J. &amp;. P. Carsoel at the Place St. Job in Uccle, a 20-minute cab ride from downtown,  (32-2) 374-6694, is my favorite neighborhood restaurant; Michelin handed it a star this year. The decor is simple but the cuisine highly inventive: swordfish carpaccio, lasagna of roast salmon and langoustines, lightly curried caramelized apple. Dinner with wine for two is $100. Prix fixe  menus are bargains: a two-course lunch, $14; four-course dinner, $29.</p>
        <p>L'Atelier de la Truffe Noire, 300,  avenue Louise, (32-2) 640-5455, always packed, is the fast-food outlet of Luigi Ciciriello, proprietor of the eponymous astronomically expensive restaurant. The Atelier, crammed into a former patisserie, is open 8:30 a.m to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday (Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.). The enormous choice ranges from a $3.40 salami sandwich to truffle-and-goose liver in puff pastry  ($55). More typical prices for a main course are $11 to $16, wine $4.50.</p>
        <p>For a budget meal, a good choice is  't Kelderke, in a subterranean brick vault at 15 Grand-Place, (32-2) 513-7344, open daily from noon to 2 a.m. The plat du jour is an unbeatable $6.70. Stoemp -- a potato and vegetable mash -- with sausages and other Brussels specialties served in generous portions takes pride of place. Two can dine in style for $45, or half that with a bit of care.</p>
        <p>And thousands of Bruxellois lunch every day for less than $2.50 on copious French bread sandwiches, stacked high in snack shops and butcher shops all over town.</p>
        <p>Shopping</p>
        <p>The preference of chocolate gourmets in this city of great chocolate has switched from milk or white chocolate to ever darker cacao in search of the pure chocolate taste. Three chocolatiers are ahead of the rest in this pursuit: Wittamer (6  Place du Grand Sablon), past masters at fresh-cream pralines, $8.50 for 250 grams; Galler (44 rue au Beurre near the Grand-Place), whose Extreme is 70 percent cacao, $7 (250 grams); and a newcomer,  Pierre Marcolini (39 Place du Grand Sablon), where you can taste before you buy from a flowing chocolate fountain, $9 (250 grams).</p>
