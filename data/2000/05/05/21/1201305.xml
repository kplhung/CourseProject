        <p>John Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., is doing his country and the labor movement a disservice by fighting so hard against permanently establishing normal trade relations with China. Of all the groups lobbying on this issue, none has made a greater historic blunder than organized labor. By bludgeoning Richard Gephardt and the Democrats into sticking with labor on the issue, which the House is set to vote on this week, Mr. Sweeney is squandering much of the good will he has built up in recent years and damaging the interests of American workers. House Democrats should back the bill, which deserves bipartisan support.</p>
        <p>President Clinton has had trouble finding a sure footing in his approach on China. He began in 1993 by making tough demands on human rights and now too often looks the other way on these issues. But the administration has reached a formula that is basically sound. Human rights are served, not hindered, by opening China to more foreign goods, particularly in telecommunications and technology, which are bound to bring more information from abroad to the Chinese people. China's membership in the World Trade Organization will allow more scrutiny of its treatment of workers, its record of piracy and even its treatment of the environment.</p>

        <p>John Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., is doing his country and the labor movement a disservice by fighting so hard against permanently establishing normal trade relations with China. Of all the groups lobbying on this issue, none has made a greater historic blunder than organized labor. By bludgeoning Richard Gephardt and the Democrats into sticking with labor on the issue, which the House is set to vote on this week, Mr. Sweeney is squandering much of the good will he has built up in recent years and damaging the interests of American workers. House Democrats should back the bill, which deserves bipartisan support.</p>
        <p>President Clinton has had trouble finding a sure footing in his approach on China. He began in 1993 by making tough demands on human rights and now too often looks the other way on these issues. But the administration has reached a formula that is basically sound. Human rights are served, not hindered, by opening China to more foreign goods, particularly in telecommunications and technology, which are bound to bring more information from abroad to the Chinese people. China's membership in the World Trade Organization will allow more scrutiny of its treatment of workers, its record of piracy and even its treatment of the environment.</p>
        <p>Since the late 19th century, the Democratic Party has stood for workers' interests, and it interpreted their interests as being served by free trade. It used to be that big American corporations favored high tariff barriers to protect themselves against cheaper foreign goods, but Democrats saw that workers are served not by insulating their employers from competition, but by food, clothing and other necessities sold here at low prices.</p>
        <p>The bill before Congress does not open the United States to more Chinese products. Rather, it opens China to more American goods and investment, and imposes a mechanism that can be used to challenge unfair Chinese practices. Labor fears that more investment abroad will lead to less investment at home, and fewer jobs. But if American technology and manufacturing companies are not allowed to compete in China with other foreign investors, they will be less able to serve as healthy employers in the United States. Some American workers will doubtless be hurt by foreign competition. But the solution is to help these workers, not to try to block the forces of economic globalization that are benefiting the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sweeney's reasons for taking on this issue may have more to do with his own political interests than those of workers at large. He won his election with the support of the Teamsters union and is now listening to the Teamsters on this issue. Other unions within the labor coalition are less enthusiastic about the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s wrongheaded stance. Many Democrats in Congress are angry that organized labor has also opposed lowering trade barriers for Africa and the Caribbean, where some of the most miserably paid workers in the world would benefit. Organized labor claims it is now standing up for Chinese workers by opposing the trade bill. But workers in the developing world know that trade is one of their only avenues of hope.</p>
        <p>The trade bill could be Mr. Clinton's last tough legislative battle as president. His commendable willingness to stand up to labor and most members of his own party on trade belies his reputation as subservient to his party's core constituencies. On the other side of the aisle, Gov. George W. Bush has shown leadership in repudiating the isolationists in his own party. Organized labor's decision to turn this into a make-or-break test of loyalty for its supporters has been shortsighted and destructive.</p>
