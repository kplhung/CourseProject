      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Traveling in Japan has become slightly less expensive with the abolition of a local 3 percent tourism tax. The tax, which for more than 40 years was applied to hotel rooms that cost more than about $140 and meals of more than about $70, was discontinued on April 1. Now only a countrywide 5 percent consumption tax and a tax of about $1.30 a day for hot-spring use at some major resorts remain.</p>
        <p>The Japan National Tourist Organization likens the consumption tax with the 6 percent or more sales taxes in many states, the value added taxes of 10 percent or more in Europe, and the New York City hotel tax of 13.25 percent. The consumption tax can be avoided on goods costing more than about $94 when bought at tax-free stores.</p>
