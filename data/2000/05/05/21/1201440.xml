        <p>Fortunately for the Devils, goalie Martin Brodeur played better last night than he did in the previous game. He made some good saves and some good clearing passes and said afterward that he ''kept my team in the game.''</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for the Devils, Brodeur also helped to keep the Flyers in the game. Two of his turnovers led to Philadelphia goals, the first one in a direct and deflating fashion when the game was scoreless and tense late in the first period. All this contributed to a 3-1 victory that gave the Flyers a 3-1 series lead in the four-of-seven-game Eastern Conference finals. The Devils can be eliminated tomorrow night in Game 5 in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>''Lucky goal,'' Brodeur said of Philadelphia's first, the one that was deflected by Mark Recchi after Simon Gagne had intercepted Brodeur's pass and fired a shot from the left-wing corner. ''Went off me. Went off the post. Went in.''</p>
        <p>It went in partly because Brodeur did not seal off the short side after the turnover and the puck eluded him, his pads and his stick. Gagne scored the final goal of the game on a play that began with Recchi's interception of another Brodeur pass. ''We surprised him, I think,'' Gagne said, referring to the first goal. But he could have been referring to the entire series.</p>
        <p>Brodeur was not the only one so sanguine among the losing Devils. They kept saying they beat themselves. They did not offer much credit to the Flyers, who also beat the Devils for the regular-season title in the conference. Randy McKay said, ''We're angry, and we should be angry at ourselves.''</p>
        <p>Certainly their coach, Larry Robinson, is angry with them. Usually one to prod his players with positive reinforcement, Robinson shouted at them behind closed doors after the game, and his voice could be heard in the corridor outside the locker room. He also kicked over a trash can.</p>
        <p>''He was very disappointed in our third period,'' McKay said.</p>
        <p>Their fans should be both disappointed and worried. Despite the miscues of Brodeur and others, many Devils played well. Bobby Holik, along with scoring his second goal of the series, delivered five hits. Claude Lemieux led the team with six hits, inspired the team and the capacity crowd with a momentum-turning penalty kill in the second period and loosened up Flyers goalie Brian Boucher with a slap shot that cracked off the headgear. And there was a frozen moment when Jason Arnott, who played well, ripped a shot off Boucher's shoulder that fluttered tantalizingly over the crossbar.</p>
        <p>But there are also images that could linger longer than what could be a short series. One is of John LeClair, the rugged Flyers forward with the battered face, bursting past the Devils' captain, Scott Stevens, on an end-to-end rush. Another is of Ken Daneyko, another veteran of the Devils' defense, making a futile wave at a fluttering puck that eventually eluded Brodeur on a deflection by Craig Berube.</p>
        <p>And so many of the lingering images are of Brodeur. Again, as in the previous game, he was bested by Boucher. One of Brodeur's strengths is puck-handling, but the Flyers are taking advantage of it, putting themselves in position to intercept his passes. It is as if they have scouted him well and know what to expect. When asked if he needs to consider a more conservative approach, Brodeur shrugged off the question with: ''Not really.''</p>
        <p>The Flyers probably hope he does not change a thing. Eric Desjardins, the Flyers' captain, who is stopping many of Brodeur's passes at the blue line, said Brodeur's clearing plays are ''something we've adjusted to a little bit.'' Recchi said the Flyers were sending the puck in along the boards and using pressure from the first forechecker to keep Brodeur from playing the puck up the middle.</p>
        <p>The series is being defined as Boucher, a rookie goalie making his reputation, against Brodeur, a veteran star who is not living up to his. When a goalie is playing well, it seems to ignite a team, making every player more confident in his own playmaking, more focused in his physical effort. When a goalie is struggling, it seems as if every mistake may end up in the net. Players press and elbows get tight.</p>
        <p>Despite the reality, Brodeur said he remained confident that the Devils could change the momentum and take advantage of his counterpart at the other end of the rink.</p>
        <p>''We shot on this guy,'' Brodeur said. ''The puck was behind him all night. He was just real lucky about it.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps, speaking in his second language, Brodeur did not mean to sound so cocky. Let's hope that this is the case. He and his teammates have nothing to be smug about.</p>
