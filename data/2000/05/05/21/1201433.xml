        <p>Minnesota Timberwolves guard Malik Sealy, one of the most productive scorers in St. John's basketball history and a player who remained active in the New York community, died in a head-on car crash outside Minneapolis yesterday before dawn.</p>
        <p>Sealy, 30, had attended the 24th birthday party for Kevin Garnett, his Timberwolves teammate. According to the Minnesota State Patrol, he was driving his 1993 Range Rover south on a divided highway in St. Louis Park, Minn., at 4:07 a.m. when the driver of a Dodge pickup truck was traveling the wrong way in Sealy's lane and struck the sport utility vehicle.</p>
        <p>Sealy died of head and chest injuries at the scene, according to the state patrol. The other driver, Souksangouane Phengsene of Minneapolis, suffered head and chest injuries and was listed in serious condition at the Hennepin County Medical Center.</p>
        <p>The state authorities were investigating whether alcohol was a factor because members of emergency crews indicated that Phengsene might have been drinking. Sealy was not wearing a seat belt and his car had no air bag.</p>
        <p>Sealy became the second National Basketball Association player killed in a car crash this season. The Charlotte Hornets guard Bobby Phills died in January when he lost control of his Porsche while drag-racing with his teammate David Wesley and collided with two other cars near the Charlotte Coliseum in North Carolina.</p>
        <p>Sealy's Minnesota teammates, who had known him for the past two seasons, gathered at his house in suburban Minneapolis to comfort his wife, Lisa, and the couple's baby son, Malik Remington, yesterday morning after hearing the news. When word traveled to the New York area, Sealy's former teammates and coaches at St. John's were equally devastated.</p>
        <p>Lou Carnesecca was unprepared for the news when he answered the phone at his Queens home yesterday afternoon.</p>
        <p>''I got the call and I was numb,'' said Carnesecca, the former St. John's coach who had recruited Sealy out of Tolentine High School in the Bronx. ''This just hits you so hard. If you don't have faith, this kind of thing would blow your mind because he was so young and he was such a good kid. Like I said, I'm numb.''</p>
        <p>Carnesecca last saw Sealy at a St. John's charity function in Manhattan 10 days ago and also attended Sealy's marriage to a former St. John's cheerleader last August.</p>
        <p>The coach spoke between sobs about the lanky, 6-foot-8-inch player who became a freshman at St. John's in 1988 after having led Tolentine to a national No. 1 ranking and a New York State title.</p>
        <p>''He was probably one of the brightest kids I've ever had because he knew where he was going,'' Carnesecca said. ''He was in command of his life. I always thought he was going to be somebody who went somewhere, aside from basketball, and he was. This guy was going somewhere after basketball was over.''</p>
        <p>Sealy graduated from St. John's with a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1992 and left as the school's second-leading career scorer, with 2,402 points. He is still ranked behind only Chris Mullin.</p>
        <p>Sealy averaged more than 22 points in his junior and senior years, when he was named to the all-Big East first teams. Sealy's 238 career steals is still a school record.</p>
        <p>He helped St. John's win the National Invitation Tournament title in his freshman year, when he was mentored by Jayson Williams. ''I feel like I lost my little brother,'' Williams, now a Nets power forward, said.</p>
        <p>After being drafted as the 14th pick over all by the Indiana Pacers in 1992, Sealy was a reserve until he was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers in 1994. After three seasons there, he signed as a free agent with the Detroit Pistons in 1997. He moved as a free agent to the Timberwolves in January 1999.</p>
        <p>After sustaining an ankle injury last season, Sealy came back stronger this season. He improved his shooting percentage, finishing at 47.6 percent. He had never shot better than 43.5 percent in his first seven seasons. He averaged 11.3 points in the regular season and 12.5 in the playoffs as Minnesota was eliminated in four games in the first round by the Portland Trail Blazers.</p>
        <p>''This is a sudden and devastating loss to our team,'' said Kevin McHale, the Timberwolves' vice president for basketball operations.  ''We're in shock. Malik was one of the most popular players in our locker room, and one of the biggest reasons behind our turnaround and success this past season on the court.''</p>
        <p>Off the court, Sealy was an entrepreneur. His mother, Ann, had taught him to sew when he was in fifth grade. In the midst of his pro career, Sealy founded his own company that designed ties and clothing, Malik Sealy XXI, Inc. He was planning a charity golf tournament in St. Lucia that was to benefit underprivileged youths this June. He also tried acting, appearing in the television shows ''The Sentinel'' and ''Diagnosis Murder'' and the basketball movie ''Eddie.''</p>
        <p>''Malik has always been a self-starter,'' Ann Sealy said in 1992. Sealy was an honors student and class president at Tolentine. ''He didn't need the school to motivate him,'' his mother said. ''He's gotten that from his family.''</p>
        <p>Sealy, one of five children who grew up in the Tremont section of the Bronx, always credited his father, Sidney, as being a role model for him. Sidney was a bodyguard for Malcolm X.</p>
        <p>Despite moving around the country, Sealy stayed involved with St. John's, consistently joining a group of St. John's alumni who returned every summer to work out at Alumni Hall with other former and current players, including Williams, Mullin and Mark Jackson. When he was in town, he attended St. John's games.</p>
        <p>''We will long remember Malik, not only for his outstanding ability on the basketball court, but also for his gentleness and strength of character in our classrooms and throughout our campus,'' said the Rev. Donald J. Harrington, president of St. John's.</p>
        <p>St. John's athletic director, Ed Manetta Jr., said: ''More than a professional, he was a good friend to our alumni as well as to our current and former players. The New York community has lost a wonderful role model, loving family man and great friend. He will be sorely missed.''</p>
        <p>As in Phills's untimely death, the sentiment yesterday was that another unnecessary accident had claimed the life of a gracious man who had persevered in his career.</p>
        <p>At a news conference, the Timberwolves' president, Rob Moor, called Sealy a ''unique individual.''</p>
        <p>''His sense of humor is what I'll remember more than anything,'' Moor said. ''His off-the-cuff comments; he could take you by surprise and say the most wonderful things at the perfect time. That's something we'll certainly miss.''</p>
        <p>Ten days after Carnesecca spoke with his former player about his future as a free agent, the coach was waiting for details of Sealy's funeral.</p>
        <p>''All I can tell you is he was one of the smartest players I ever had,'' Carnesecca said. ''If I diagrammed a play, he would come up with three or four different options off the same play. He could go along with what the coach was thinking. He was just a great player and a great person.''</p>
        <p>''Malik Sealy was a stellar contributor to the N.B.A., his team and his community,'' N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern said.</p>
        <p>''This is a tragic day for the N.B.A. family and we extend our sympathy and prayers to his family.''</p>
