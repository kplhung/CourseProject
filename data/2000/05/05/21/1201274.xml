        <p>ENTREPRENEURIAL challenge is not a new concept to W. Park Kerr. After all, he and his mother had started the El Paso Chile Company by selling chile ristras, or garlands of red-hot chiles, on a roadside in El Paso, their hometown. Now, 20 years later, the close-knit family business -- which includes his mother, Norma; sister, Monica; and brother-in-law, Sean -- makes a line of salsas, hot sauces, dips and chips that brings in more than $10 million a year.</p>
        <p>Though business was great, Mr. Kerr hit a self-proclaimed midlife crisis a few years ago and was itching for a new cross-border thrill. ''In our company, any family member with a really good idea can pitch it,'' he said. ''So, I said: 'I want to make tequila. Are you guys in?' They gave me $30,000 and a credit card to explore the venture with their blessing.'' (So far, he has spent about a half-million dollars.)</p>
        <p>His decision to enter an already crowded market and take on another country's national obsession raised eyebrows in the spirits industry. And those who know the Mexican tequila world had their doubts that Mr. Kerr could accomplish his goal of making a custom-distilled premium product. After all, the non-Mexican companies in the business were just distributors, buying ready-made tequila and slapping private labels on it, like Don Eduardo, from Brown-Forman, or Porfidio from Martin Gassl.</p>
        <p>Bob Emmons, an industry consultant who wrote ''The Book of Tequila,'' said: ''The Mexicans jealously guard their tequila. It's highly unlikely that any outsider could pull this off.''</p>
        <p>Robert Denton, who imports two premium tequilas, El Tesoro and Chinaco, was also skeptical. ''No one rents out their distilleries for an American to come and make their tequila, believe me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the charismatic Mr. Kerr was indeed able to convince a distiller to make a tequila the way he wanted it. After almost three years in development, the El Paso Chile Company's new offering, Tequila Nacional Silver, has hit the United States market 6,000 bottles strong. The tequila, already available in Texas, will reach stores in New Jersey this week, with New York and several other states to follow in the next few months.</p>
        <p>It was not easy, Mr. Kerr said recently over a perfectly chilled margarita (with salt). But perseverance and connections helped.</p>
        <p>Learning all he could about the tequila process went smoothly enough. He hired a Mexican bottle manufacturer that, in turn, introduced Mr. Kerr to its distillery clients. Such links were crucial. ''These people are very traditional,'' Mr. Kerr said. ''It's probably only because of the personal nature of my introduction, and that I speak Spanish, that I eventually won their trust.'' He learned about growing, harvesting and distilling the spiky agave plant's fruit, the pina, which looks something like a pineapple on steroids and can weigh 100 pounds.</p>
        <p>By last winter, Mr. Park was ready to contract with a distillery, though he had a laundry list of criteria. It had to be midsized -- small enough so an extra $500,000 in annual income would make a difference, yet large enough to handle the planned volume. It could not have competing brands in the United States. It should be in Los Altos, in the state of Jalisco, where, Mr. Kerr said, ''the earth is red and the agave grow sweet.''</p>
        <p>That was not all: The tequila would have none of the ammonia nitrate, flavoring or urea often used in commercial tequila. The pinas were to be roasted before fermentation in the traditional adobe ovens called hornos, and the distiller had to agree to roast the fruit slowly and to let it cool for a full 24 hours before distillation, to improve taste. Mr. Kerr wanted to supply his own yeast and yeast food. He insisted on potstills made of stainless steel instead of copper, for a purer flavor. To ensure purity, all production had to be above ground, in an immaculately clean plant free of chemical contamination.</p>
        <p>''Did I tell you my favorite story?'' he asked. ''I visited one distiller who was very proud of how clean his plant was, because every day he scrubbed the machinery and floors down with Pine-Sol. What do you think his tequila tasted like?''</p>
        <p>Distillers he visited told him to be a good boy, buy ready-made tequila and put his own label on it. Who would know the difference? And once the distillers understood that Mr. Kerr, an American businessman, was seeking control over how his tequila was made, none would play; they did not return his phone calls.</p>
        <p>As despair was setting in, Mr. Kerr met Thomas Fernandez, the owner of Coca-Cola bottlers in five Mexican regions, at a cocktail party.  ''I play in two worlds -- America and Mexico,'' he said he told Mr. Fernandez in frustration. ''I live on the border. I speak Spanish. I love everything about this culture and its food. Yet no one understands me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fernandez thought that one of his sons might be able to help. When Mr. Kerr got together with Miguel Fernandez, a man of American and Mexican parentage who attended schools on both sides of the border, he knew he had found an ideal ally.</p>
        <p>With the younger Mr. Fernandez at his side, Mr. Kerr found, distillers were willing to talk about the project, and he could begin choosing instead of begging. ''Out of 20, five were out because they were too big, five others because they were too small,'' Mr. Kerr said. ''Seven didn't make the cut because of integrity and cleanliness issues -- which, believe me, is a big deal down there. We finally came down to a list of three distillers. One guy at the last minute balked at our bringing our own yeast and distillation techniques in, and then it came down to price.  One guy wanted to charge us $10 a liter of tequila, which is a huge amount of money. In April we finally went with Destileria San Isidreo, who agreed to all of the terms.''</p>
        <p>As in-country coordinator for Tequila Nacional, Mr. Fernandez interprets the intricate Mexican culture.</p>
        <p>''This is about strategic partnering with someone in Mexico with fluency on both sides of the border, who can understand American urgency and Mexican politics,'' Mr. Kerr said.</p>
        <p>EVEN though Destileria San Isidreo agreed to use Mr. Kerr's recipe, Mr. Fernandez is on hand to oversee it personally. He springs surprise distillery visits, makes sure no rotten or blighted agaves get into the mix and reminds the distiller why the pinas have to be washed before they are split and thrown into the hornos.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fernandez said the distiller, whose own approach to planning and organization was very different from Mr. Kerr's, was ''finally open to our advice.''</p>
        <p>''The project has gone relatively smoothly, though the Mexican government paperwork has been a bureaucratic nightmare,'' Mr. Fernandez said. ''If a word is misspelled or an 'i' not dotted, the document is returned for correction.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerr said he admired some aspects of the Mexican system. ''Here, we got our trademark in three months,'' he said, ''way shorter than the United States.''</p>
        <p>Now the task is to make Tequila Nacional stand out on crowded retail shelves. Mr. Kerr made a point of thinking about this early and often, and he had an established company with related products in his corner. Leveraging and capitalizing on El Paso Chile's current market position -- it is the industry leader in the highest-priced tier of the salsa market -- the company started guerrilla marketing before there was anything to sell.</p>
        <p>It introduced a line of salsas called Borracho (''drunk,'' in Spanish) with the words ''made with Tequila Nacional'' displayed on the labels, as well as a margarita mix and margarita salt. ''The El Paso Chile Company Margarita Cookbook,'' published last May, included a full-color reproduction of the Tequila Nacional label. Mr. Kerr is banking on niche marketing and brand allegiance for the tequila, which will have a retail price of about $35 to $40, midpriced for a premium brand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Denton, the importer who thought it was impossible, conceded that Park Kerr appears to have beaten the odds by bringing a custom-distilled tequila to market. But like Mr. Kerr's Mexican distiller, he does not see why Mr. Kerr insists on having the agaves washed before roasting. ''Nothing can live through distillation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerr's response: ''I'm a little obsessive.''</p>
