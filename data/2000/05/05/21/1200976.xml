        <p>IN the landscape, in the very atmosphere of islands, there is often a visceral feeling of apartness. It may have its roots in certain obvious isolating factors of geography and history, but there is a further dimension, less easily pinpointed, a kind of island sensibility, an individuality. A sense that things are done differently on island turf; an attention to old customs and legacies; a respect for nature and a husbanding of natural resources. You feel it in Sardinia and in Sicily and on Patmos. Imagine, though, feeling it on a river island, one connected to a major highway by a bridge not much longer than a freeway overpass.</p>
        <p>Ten miles from downtown Portland, Ore., Sauvie Island is one such remarkably intact, almost willfully independent place. Situated  at the conjunction of the Columbia and Willamette Rivers, the island incarnates some of the best of the Pacific Northwest. It is a wildlife preserve, rigorously managed. It is farmland, tenderly cultivated. It is pioneer history, saved and showcased. It is free of gas stations, restaurants, souvenir shops and Starbucks. It has birds and beauty, lakes and beaches. It has air that shimmers. It has silence.</p>
        <p>Sauvie Island is a place to visit, and to grasp, in a day. Sixteen miles long and four miles wide, the island has half its 24,000 acres under control of the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, which manages a habitat where 250 species of birds either rest or winter each year, among them bald eagles, Canada geese, great blue herons, sandhill cranes, swans, wood ducks and hawks; such avian prodigiousness could blur the vision of even the most indefatigable birdwatcher. Mammalian specimens include red fox, black-tailed deer, raccoons and Homo sapiens, of which there are fewer than 1,000 full-time residents in all. The island's flora is its pride, both indigenous (willows, cottonwood, ash, white oaks more than half a millennium old) and cultivated (berries, apples, pumpkins, squash).</p>
        <p>All this bounty is a direct result of Sauvie Island's strong relationship to the two rivers. The island's strikingly fertile soil derives from millions of years of alluvial deposits of Oregon earth from nearby hills and valleys. Until the 1930's, when a system of dikes and levees was built, the island flooded regularly during the spring melts -- well into the 20th century, it was not uncommon for cows to be swum or floated across the river to safety until the ground re-emerged from the water. Such antique practices are not uncommon on an island that didn't receive electricity until 1936, telephone service until 1948, or a bridge connecting it to the mainland until 1950.</p>
        <p>Turning onto this bridge from Highway 30 last summer, I crossed the Multnomah Channel and quickly glided down a ramp that spills onto the island. I made an immediate left onto Sauvie Island Road and stopped at Sam's Cracker Barrel Grocery to buy a map (10 cents) and an Oregon Fish and Wildlife parking permit ($3.50), which is required of anyone wishing to park on state-owned land. I continued north along Sauvie Island Road and after a mile and a half came to the island's architectural jewel, the Bybee-Howell House, which was built between 1856 and 1858 and remained in the family of its second owners, the Howells, until the early 1960's, when it was pur chased and restored by Multnomah County. Owned and maintained now by Metro Regional Parks and Greenspaces, the house is open on weekend afternoons from early June to Labor Day. It is not to be missed.</p>
        <p>Originally from Kentucky, Col. James Bybee and his wife, Julia, came across the Oregon Trail (traveling separately) in the late 1840's. Under the Donation Land Act of 1850, as a married couple they were entitled to 640 acres; the Bybees' claim, at the choice southern end of the island, was convenient to river traffic and trade, and it contained the island's highest ground, a gentle knoll where they eventually built their elegant Greek Revival house. In an era when most new arrivals were still living in rough and hastily assembled log cabins, Bybee by contrast built a graceful structure of eight rooms symmetrically arranged on two floors.</p>
        <p>The house was said to be the first in Oregon to use plaster, which was brought around the Horn from New York. The parlor mantelpiece (one of six fireplaces in all) is framed by Doric pilasters, and its ceiling features an acanthus ornament as sophisticated and well-wrought as any to be found in a Manhattan townhouse of the same period. Although there is no Bybee family furniture on display, the house has been handsomely appointed by the Oregon Historical Society with a mixture of Hepplewhite, Sheraton, Empire and Victorian pieces that reflect the taste of the 1850's to the 1880's.</p>
        <p>A visit to the property is incomplete without a tour of its stables, where a farm museum depicts the pioneers' response to their new land.  The museum chronicles the Oregon farming experience from the 1850's through the 1920's; also on exhibit are milk processing equipment, blacksmithing tools, and a complete saddle-making shop from an Eastern Oregon ranch, which is unusually intact.</p>
        <p>A few minutes farther along Sauvie Island Road is the Kruger Farm Market, the former Sauvie Island Market, where additional evidence of the island's agricultural prowess is abundantly on display -- and on sale. The market is but the most public example of what the island still does best, which is grow crops for retail and commercial use. It sells produce by the bulk (25 pounds of beets, at the height of summer, were $7.95, reduced from $8.95) and the canning supplies, pectin, and pickling salt to cope with such Brobdingnagian quantities. ''Wintering in'' was the name of a harvest celebration in pioneer days; much of this preserving, hibernatory instinct lingers locally.</p>
        <p>On the day I visited, the market was selling peppers ablaze with color, sweet corn as thick and robust as baseball bats, tomatoes so deep and aromatic a red that I could envision them virtually turning themselves into salad or pasta sauce. One of its most likable features is the U-pick flower and herb fields, where, equipped with a pair of scissors and a white plastic bucket, you can have all the pleasure of gardening with none of the work. Flowers begin at 20 cents apiece; $5 or $6 buys you a splashy bouquet of dahlias, sunflowers, zinnias and statice.</p>
        <p>At the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, which is a few minutes farther north on Sauvie Island Road, information is available about the island's wildlife preserves, walking trails and fishing holes. A mile or so farther on still is a historical marker at the site of Fort William, which was founded in 1834 by Nathaniel Wyeth, a distant ancestor of the Wyeth family of painters. Although no trace of Wyeth's fort -- which was essentially a trading post -- remains, the presence of the marker is a reminder of two critical aspects of the island's past: its very earliest settler period, which preceded the arrival of the Bybees, the Howells and their fellow Oregon Trail travelers, and its vast Native American history.</p>
        <p>Among the earliest white visitors to the island were that indefatigable and ever-curious duo, Lewis and Clark, who stopped by in 1805 and 1806 and called the island Wappato, after the potato-like tuber that grew wild in the marshes and was prized by the Indians. In 1821, the Hudson's Bay Company, the powerful British fur trading monopoly, moved down from Canada to the lower Columbia Valley, settling first at Fort George (present-day Astoria, Ore.) and then (in 1825) at Fort Vancouver, upriver and close to Sauvie Island. After Wyeth's trading post failed, the Hudson's Bay Company established several dairies on the island, one of which was run by a French Canadian, Laurent Sauve, who gave his name to the island and supplied milk, butter and cheese to Fort Vancouver.</p>
        <p>''Mortality has carried off to a man its inhabitants,'' Wyeth observed when he set up his trading post. The men he was speaking of --  and none too sympathetically: he was pleased, he wrote, that providence made it unnecessary for him to kill them off -- were, of course, the Indians, who had lived on Sauvie Island for generations. They were called ''Chinookan'' because of their language. They lived in villages built of cedar logs; traveled in long canoes; made beautiful artifacts, and kept slaves, from whom they distinguished themselves by flattening their own heads. When Lt. William Broughton visited in 1792, there were an estimated 2,000 Indians on the island; scarcely four decades later, decimated by smallpox, syphilis, measles, tuberculosis and ague, the population had vanished, as Wyeth put it, ''to a man.''</p>
        <p>The noted naturalist John K. Townsend, visiting the island in the 1830's, found a ''melancholy aspect'' there, and it is no wonder. Some of this sense of loss, perhaps, contributes to the island's spectral atmosphere, which is present even today.  To have been so vividly inhabited by a people and then to have all this life reduced to nothing more than arrowheads, fragments of sculpture and explorers' accounts crumbling in old, seldom read books, touches a place indelibly.</p>
        <p>Making an about-face at the Wyeth marker, I set off in quest of the less loss-suffused side of Sauvie Island. I retraced my path, drove under the bridge, and turned left onto Gillihan Loop Road. After about two miles I arrived at the Pumpkin Patch, another compendious farm stand. A key attraction here, delightfully child-friendly, is an animal barn, where Chuck, a chicken, resided alongside quail by the name of Chubby, Bubby and Cubby; a couple of rabbits named Cheyenne and Frosty, and assorted calves, ducks, pigs and goats. A cafe on the grounds sells short-order food, which I skipped in favor of a piece of Peaches and Cream bicolor corn ($1), a delicious sun-sweetened, butter-shined mid-day snack.</p>
        <p>Six miles ahead, I turned onto Reeder Road and drove for eight miles through the lush farmland that is so characteristic of the Sauvie Island landscape. I stopped at a wildlife viewing platform, where a strong breeze caused the trees to shiver and bend. Here I learned that the island is a winter home or rest stop to almost three million ducks and geese. It is also an important nesting ground for sandhill cranes and shorebirds. Wood ducks, the Sauvie Island mascot, dwell in a virtual apartment complex of hollow trees and nest boxes spread across the terrain.</p>
        <p>Sauvie Island's lack of what are commonly called amenities deeply enhances the experience of cruising along its peaceful, gently winding roads. Traveling by bicycle, as many people do, is perhaps the ideal way to appreciate the landscape, whose combination of farmland and farmhouses, new and old, was interrupted only by a genteel convenience store where I added bread, cheese and a cold drink to my cache of fruit and vegetables before heading to the river beaches.</p>
        <p>Reeder Road, which turns rocky after about three miles, leads to several Columbia River beaches. At Walton Beach, which comes first, or at Collins Beach, where clothing is optional, access is through a stand of trees, which gives way to scrub, then to clean soft sand. The water in the still-trafficked Columbia is probably not the purest in the region, but a walk along, or a picnic in view of, the gently lapping river, with the leaves rustling overhead and the sun bringing out all that glorious Northwest green, and with no sign of the modern world (not even clothes, if you choose) to break the spell, takes you back to the old, untouched times when Oregon was still a raw and rugged territory, intoxicated with -- and possessed by -- nature, not man. Indian times; pioneer times; slow, serene island time: on Sauvie Island, all three are palpably in the air.</p>
        <p>Day trip to another world</p>
        <p>Logistics</p>
        <p>The appeal of Sauvie Island is closely linked to its lack of amenities.</p>
        <p>Visitors should plan on staying in Portland and making a day trip to the island, where a picnic lunch can be assembled at the farm stands. No gasoline is available on the island, so remember to fill up before arriving.</p>
