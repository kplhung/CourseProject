        <p>IF Broadway were a religion, Rosie O'Donnell would most certainly make the short list for beatification. Her syndicated daytime talk show is a virtual worship service for the theater.</p>
        <p>Where else on the air -- besides, maybe, a local public television station in some woebegone late-night time slot -- would there be a host who entertains her audiences with such arcane bits of theater lore as the spending habits of Barry and Fran Weissler, producers of ''Chicago'' and ''Annie Get Your Gun''?</p>
        <p>Ms. O'Donnell does not just periodically trot out the cast of ''The Lion King,'' the monster-hit Disney musical over which she rhapsodizes on a regular basis; she also invites actors in straight plays for a chat and a plug. And in an act that could be counted a miracle in the theater-averse world of commercial television, she even books guests who happen to be appearing, gulp, Off Broadway.</p>
        <p>She does not merely broadcast her faith; she envelops herself in it, like an herbal wrap. To hear her tell it, of the many perks of her enormous visibility, the most useful is one with which any theater lover can identify: the ability to score better seats. ''The best part of being famous,'' she said recently, in her toy-strewn Rockefeller Center office, ''is getting to go to the opening nights of shows.''</p>
        <p>Spend any time at all with Ms. O'Donnell, and you discern that she is not kidding. She is truly Stage Door Rosie, a perpetual 11-year-old, clutching a creased Playbill and forever waiting at the side entrance of the theater at play's end for the Broadway star to emerge. In the pantheon of award-show hosts from Bob Hope to Billy Crystal, Ms. O'Donnell is an original: the fan-club president with her own name in lights.</p>
        <p>The Long Island-bred comedian will, after a year's sabbatical from the ceremonies, be the host of the Tony Awards again two Sundays hence, and given the vast amount of play she gives to plays on her own program, her nighttime duties on behalf of the American Theater Wing and the League of American Theaters and Producers might be looked on as mere overtime. If the power of her show to sell tickets is not what it once was -- Broadway publicity agents say that there has been nothing recently to match the impact she had on such musicals as ''Titanic'' and ''The Lion King'' -- she remains Broadway's most influential booster on television. In the words of one Broadway marketer, ''She keeps theater in the pop consciousness.''</p>
        <p>Could that be because the theater is rarely out of her own consciousness? ''Something emotional will happen to me, and a lyric will come up to define my life,'' she said. After the shootings last year at Columbine High School in Colorado, for example, Ms. O'Donnell used her pulpit on ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' to talk about her belief in gun control, an outspokenness that led to a testy on-air exchange with the actor Tom Selleck, a supporter of the National Rifle Association.</p>
        <p>''During Columbine I was so upset,'' she said. ''What was going through my head? 'If I speak, I am condemned. If I stay silent, I am damned.' '' If the words sound familiar, perhaps it is because they are sung by Jean Valjean in the musical ''Les Miserables.''</p>
        <p>To a fellow theater lover, the diagnosis is pretty plain: Ms. O'Donnell suffers from show-tune-itis. It is a lifetime affliction, and there is no hope of a cure. It is particularly rampant among a certain subset of baby boomers for whom cast albums, in the heyday of musical comedy, provided the emotional underscoring of their childhoods. Ms. O'Donnell was one of these, a little girl from Commack whose mother passed on to her a devotion to the theater in the form of an LP that contained what might be the slogan of a world seen through Rosie-colored glasses: ''Don't Rain on My Parade.'' One session with ''Funny Girl'' and Barbra Streisand, and Ms. O'Donnell had found her hymnal.</p>
        <p>Her first trip to Broadway was to see Bette Midler's ''Clams on the Half Shell Revue.'' She was 11. It was love, and she fell hard. The evening was experienced in an altered state. ''It was mesmerizing,'' she recalled. ''I was captivated. I was hypnotized. I wanted to be Bette Midler. I didn't want to be like her. I wanted to be her.''</p>
        <p>Her seventh-grade English teacher took her class to see ''Sherlock Holmes.'' Alan Sues from ''Laugh-In'' was in it. ''Loved it,'' Ms. O'Donnell said. The habit was taking hold.</p>
        <p>When she got a little older, she began stealing ticket money from her father's wallet, cutting school on Wednesdays and taking the Long Island Rail Road to theaterland and a matinee. She can tick off the shows' titles like stations on the Ronkonkoma line: '' 'They're Playing Our Song,' 'Pippin,'  'Ain't Misbehavin', '  'The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,'  'Sophisticated Ladies,'  'Dreamgirls.' ''</p>
        <p>And she did, in fact, wait at the stage door. ''I got Ken Page's autograph,'' she said, referring to the original Old Deuteronomy in ''Cats.''</p>
        <p>What is the spell Broadway casts over some children, and why doesn't it happen to more of them? Ms. O'Donnell, who now has three children of her own, thinks that for one thing, the theater, a world of projected sensation, fills in the gaps in the lives of young people overcome with longing.</p>
        <p>''It was a way to express emotions and feel emotions,'' said Ms. O'Donnell, whose mother died when she was still a child. ''It's so natural to me, to want to be a part of it, that I don't understand when people don't get it. There is nothing like the smell of a waxy Playbill in your hand and the lights go down and the orchestra swells. It's unlike any other experience.''</p>
        <p>Ms. O'Donnell's house of worship is not especially discriminating; she can be supportive of shows critics adore, like ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' and ones they disdain, like ''Aida.'' Although she does put her foot down, as when the producers of ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' took a remark of hers and used it in their advertisements. ''We called them and said 'Look, it wouldn't be my top show in New York.' '' The quote was deleted.</p>
        <p>Her brassy style is not universally appreciated; some theater people took umbrage at several of her cruder jokes when she was the host of the Tonys two years ago. But her affection for things theatrical is genuine. When she recently appeared on a celebrity version of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' the producers took note of her Broadway infatuation by filling her segment with theater questions. She knew, for instance, that the original ''Oklahoma!'' was choreographed by Agnes de Mille but was stumped on Chekhov's college degree (medicine).</p>
        <p>It is about Broadway's somewhat distant relationship with children that Ms. O'Donnell offers some of her strongest opinions. Because a fixation on theatergoing is often acquired at a tender age -- ''It's similar to skiing; I didn't go until I was 30, so I missed the resonance,'' she said -- she wonders why theater owners and producers are not doing much more to make the experience accessible to the young, in the form of cheap seats and frequent sales promotions.</p>
        <p>Citing as an example ''Kids' Night on Broadway,'' the twice yearly event that allows ticket buyers to bring a child along for free, she said, ''It should be one night a month.''</p>
        <p>She has taken her two older children, who are still preschoolers, to ''The Lion King,'' ''The Sound of Music'' and ''Beauty and the Beast.''</p>
        <p>''My son went to 'The Lion King' when he was 2,'' Ms. O'Donnell said. ''At intermission, I asked if he wanted to go home. He said, 'Oh, no, Mom, this is a big show.' ''</p>
