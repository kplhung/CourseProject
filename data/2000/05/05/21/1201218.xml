        <p>The Revolution Lives</p>
        <p>Q. A faded old sign above the door at 9 Bleecker Street says ''Yipster Times,'' in a flowing, freehand script. When was it published?</p>
        <p>A. The Yipster Times was published, in one form or another, from 1972 until 1989, though in 1978 the name was changed to the somewhat less whimsical Overthrow. Primarily a journal of anti-establishment politics and culture, the newspaper also focused heavily on efforts to legalize marijuana. It was produced by a staff that was ''never larger than four to six,'' according to Dana Beal, the former editor and co-founder, and was sold at marches and rallies. The paper ''started out as a monthly, then sort of evened out as a quarterly,'' Mr. Beal said.</p>

        <p>The Revolution Lives</p>
        <p>Q. A faded old sign above the door at 9 Bleecker Street says ''Yipster Times,'' in a flowing, freehand script. When was it published?</p>
        <p>A. The Yipster Times was published, in one form or another, from 1972 until 1989, though in 1978 the name was changed to the somewhat less whimsical Overthrow. Primarily a journal of anti-establishment politics and culture, the newspaper also focused heavily on efforts to legalize marijuana. It was produced by a staff that was ''never larger than four to six,'' according to Dana Beal, the former editor and co-founder, and was sold at marches and rallies. The paper ''started out as a monthly, then sort of evened out as a quarterly,'' Mr. Beal said.</p>
        <p>The Yipster Times was printed in New Jersey, but the little building on Bleecker served as a newsroom and office for the tiny staff as well as a dormitory and meeting hall for a loosely organized group of East Village hippies, yippies and even zippies (the Zeitgeist International Party).</p>
        <p>''This was the one group of people that went into post-Marxist chaos theory,'' Mr. Beal said.</p>
        <p>The alliances and objectives of those who remain have shifted -- they are no longer affiliated with the Youth International Party -- but drug issues have remained a priority. Nine Bleecker Street is now the office of Cures Not Wars, a news service aimed at legalizing ibogaine, a psychedelic medication for addictive disorders. Like The Yipster Times and Overthrow, it also focuses on efforts to legalize marijuana.</p>
        <p>''The work didn't stop just because the newspaper did,'' Mr. Beal said. ''It might start coming out again, who knows?''</p>
        <p>Building to Heaven</p>
        <p>Q. Around the time the George Washington Bridge was built, a Methodist congregation in Washington Heights announced plans to build a ''skyscraper cathedral'' on upper Broadway. What became of the scheme?</p>
        <p>A. When it was announced in 1923 that his church at West 178th Street and Fort Washington Avenue would be razed to make way for the new bridge, the pastor, the Rev. Christian Reisner, acquired a site on Broadway between West 173rd and 174th Streets, and commissioned the architect Donn Barber to design a ''magnificent advertisement for God's business,'' with a 2,000-seat sanctuary, playgrounds, cafeteria, classrooms, dormitory and two 12-story apartment buildings flanking a huge, 40-story tower. The Broadway Temple, as it was called, would be crowned by a 75-foot-high revolving cross shooting rays of red and orange light into the sky. It would be visible 100 miles away.</p>
        <p>By 1925, half the $4 million cost had been pledged, and construction of the foundation was begun. Charles V. Bob, a mining engineer, bought the cathedral its revolving cross, named ''Byrd Beacon'' in honor of the aviator. By 1927 the apartment buildings were finished, but unanticipated  costs had already raised the Temple's price by over a million dollars. When the stock market crashed in 1929, only the bowling alley, gym and social hall in the basement were finished; empty space yawned where the 725-foot cathedral was to rise.</p>
        <p>The church did not regain its financial footing until long after Mr. Reisner's death in 1940, and construction of the Broadway Temple -- redesigned by Shreve, Lamb &amp; Harmon, the architects of the Empire State Building -- resumed in the 1950's. Completed in 1952, it is just over three stories tall.</p>
        <p>King Kong Paid More</p>
        <p>Q. After he scaled a World Trade Center tower in 1977, George H. Willig was sued by the city. How much did the human fly pay?</p>
        <p>A. The original figure of $250,000 was reduced to $1.10 -- a penny for each floor of the South Tower he climbed.</p>
