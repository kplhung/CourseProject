        <p>EVERY year for the last 72, memories of the kind that people retell to their grandchildren have been made at Playland Park here.</p>
        <p>The ingredients: cotton candy, merry-go-round rides, Nathan's hot dogs, sunny skies and sand castles by the water's edge.</p>
        <p>A recent spring afternoon, as a cool breeze swept off Long Island Sound, was the kind of day that County Legislator Katherine S. Carsky remembers spending here with her children 30 years ago. On this occasion, however, she had driven across the county from Yonkers with her grandaughters Bridgette, 2, and Kate, 6.</p>
        <p>For two Mamaroneck residents, Helen and Bob Fried, the sun and the balmy temperatures stirred up 40 years' worth of memories of visiting Playland with their children. On this particular Sunday, though, they were just with each other, ''enjoying one of the most beautiful places in Westchester,'' as Dr. Fried, a dentist, described the park, which is owned by the county.</p>
        <p>Lawrence McGowan, Playland's sign painter and restorer of carousel horses and vintage rides, said many things have not changed over the years at the park, which he visited for the first time on the day of his baptism 48 years ago. (The park and its pastel-colored Art Deco buildings were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987.)</p>
        <p>The Dragon Coaster, the Carousel, the Derby Racer, the Old Mill, the Whip, the Kiddy Coaster and the Kiddy Carousel continue to draw riders as they did in 1928, although they are supplemented these days by the Morphis, the Frog Hopper and Slime Buckets, among others.</p>
        <p>There are 46 rides in all in Kiddyland and the main park, in addition to a miniature golf course, an expansive beach area, a public pool, a boardwalk and bustling fast-food stands.</p>
        <p>Families still flock to Playland on summer afternoons, although there are more ethnic groups represented now -- Hispanic and black families, instead of just whites --  reflecting the changing demographics of the county, Mr. McGowan observed.</p>
        <p>And vintage music still plays over the loudspeakers, although what is considered ''old time'' steadily creeps into later decades.</p>
        <p>On the recent spring afternoon, while Legislator Carsky and the Frieds were recalling early memories at Playland, other visitors, including Mrs. Carsky's grandchilren, were making new ones.</p>
        <p>And who can predict how the children's recollections might be told and retold in years to come?</p>
        <p>Blackfish Running</p>
        <p>His cell phone on his belt, his fishing pole loaded with bait, Steven Yankiver, a sign manufacturer from New Rochelle, was teaching Zachary, his 10-year-old son, how to outsmart blackfish.</p>
        <p>Considering that the fishermen around them on the pier at Playland that afternoon were uttering unprintable words as the blackfish took the hooks under the rocks, where the fishing lines broke, and then spit them out, it was a complicated process that Zachary was trying to absorb.</p>
        <p>It was too windy for the father-son team to head out on Long Island Sound in Mr. Yankiver's 22-foot boat, so they came here instead. As their fishing line bobbed in the water, Mr. Yankiver took off his shirt to sun himself, donned his blue sunglasses and looked out over the water to the Long Island shoreline seven miles away.</p>
        <p>''Playland is new to us,'' said Mr. Yankiver, who was born and raised in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine. ''It's quiet. The people are friendly. The sun is beautiful.''</p>
        <p>Zachary was pleased as well. ''I'm finally getting to spend quality time with my dad,'' he said. ''He's usually at work.''</p>
        <p>Letting the Laundry Wait</p>
        <p>Farther along the boardwalk, another scenario was playing out. ''Ah, this sure beats staying home,'' Nelson Colon said with a sigh. Mr. Colon is a New York City Parks Department employee in the Bronx who had driven here with his wife, Evelyn, and their son, Nelson Jr., 17, their daughter, Evelyn, 9, and a nephew, Jesus Santiago, 14.</p>
        <p>Mr. Colon leaned against the railing alongside the boardwalk, turned his face up to the sun, and said, ''We left five bags of dirty laundry at home, but they're going to have to wait.''</p>
        <p>He continued: ''I said to my family this morning, 'Let's get out of here and go have hot dogs in the sun.' So we did, and I'm glad. You can't just stay in the house all the time.''</p>
        <p>Before they bought their Toyota, the family used to travel to Playland by bus. Mr. Colon said they prefer the park here to Coney Island.</p>
        <p>''I think it's safer,'' he explained. ''I can let the kids wander about. They're no ruthless people around, and no trouble-making teenagers.''</p>
        <p>Beach Dates</p>
        <p>At another spot on the boardwalk, Henner Solis, a carpenter from Guatemala City, and Josie Rivera, a baby sitter from Manila, were sitting on a bench, arm in arm.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rivera, who works for a family in Armonk, and Mr. Solis, who met her when he was doing construction work on the family's house, were spending the final hours of their days off at the beach. They attended a movie, dined out for lunch and then headed toward the seashore for a few hours before Ms. Rivera was due to return to her job.</p>
        <p>Nearby, Pedro Mauchi and Shirley Gonzalez and Dalton Gordon and Gloria Theral, teenagers from Stamford, were dozing on the sand. ''Great place to bring a date,'' said Mr. Mauchi, 18, an electrician who is going steady with Ms. Gonzalez, a student at Stamford High School.</p>
        <p>Down by the water's edge, another couple, Richard Butler and Vanessa Butler, were exercising two black labrador retrievers. But while it was the beginning of the season for the others, it was nearing the end of the season for the pair, who have the same last name but are not married.</p>
        <p>''We come here every Saturday and Sunday from Labor Day to Memorial Day, because it's one of the only places we can let the dogs off the leash and not get a ticket,'' Mr. Butler said. When the summer crowds arrive, they must take their dogs elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Kate and Bridgette</p>
        <p>As a child, Madeline Sweeny Carsky, who is married to one of Mrs. Carsky's sons, often visited Playland. But as the youngest of six children in her family, it was often a frustrating experience.</p>
        <p>''It took so long for me to meet the height requirements for the Dragon Coaster,'' she recalled. ''There was a cardboard man at the entrance on a sign that said, 'You have to be this tall to go on the ride.' I thought I'd never make it.''</p>
        <p>Her daughter Kate, 6, may never encounter that problem. She refused to go anywhere near the Kiddyland version of the roller coaster, much less the adult-size model. Kate and Bridgette chose instead to go on the easier, less-jolting rides and dragged along their grandmother.</p>
        <p>Mostly between rides Mrs. Carksky discussed Playland's value to the county, which she said goes beyond money. Even though the park still loses $1 million a year, the most recent earnings figures are encouraging, showing that Playland's official attendance for 1999 totaled 1.14 million -- an increase of more than 64,000 visitors over the 1998 total and the highest-recorded attendance since the park opened. Similarly, revenue topped the $10 million mark, also the highest figure ever recorded.</p>
