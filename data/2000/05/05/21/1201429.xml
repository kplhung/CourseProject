        <p>Rep Bob Wise's campaign for governor of West Virginia runs into a cybersquatter, Scott Loughery, who demands $1,500 for his rights to two Web sites bearing Wise's name and threatens to let Wise's opponents use sites against him if he does not pay up (S)</p>

        <p>In the world of the Internet, it is known as cybersquatting -- the practice of putting down $75 to lay claim to an especially appealing or recognizable Internet address before another person or organization can, then offering to sell that address to the latecomer for a nice profit.</p>
        <p>So campaign aides to Representative Bob Wise, a moderate-to-liberal West Virginia Democrat who is running this year for governor (www.BobWise2000.com and www.BobWise2000.org), were not especially surprised the other day when an e-mail message came stating that one Scott Loughery of Baltimore had laid claim to the addresses www.Wise2000.com and www. Wise2000.org. Mr. Wise's aides replied that Mr. Loughery, who they say identified himself as ''a Wise supporter,'' might want to consider ''donating'' the addresses to the Wise campaign.</p>

        <p>In the world of the Internet, it is known as cybersquatting -- the practice of putting down $75 to lay claim to an especially appealing or recognizable Internet address before another person or organization can, then offering to sell that address to the latecomer for a nice profit.</p>
        <p>So campaign aides to Representative Bob Wise, a moderate-to-liberal West Virginia Democrat who is running this year for governor (www.BobWise2000.com and www.BobWise2000.org), were not especially surprised the other day when an e-mail message came stating that one Scott Loughery of Baltimore had laid claim to the addresses www.Wise2000.com and www. Wise2000.org. Mr. Wise's aides replied that Mr. Loughery, who they say identified himself as ''a Wise supporter,'' might want to consider ''donating'' the addresses to the Wise campaign.</p>
        <p>Then came a surprise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Loughery, as the Wise aides tell it, countered with an offer to sell both addresses for $1,500 and added: ''Should you take a pass, I will likely be approaching some well-heeled members of the business community who may wish to use it to hamper such a pro-labor governor taking office. They could conceivably set up an opposition site that effectively shuts down your fund-raising. Sorry for the shakedown. I got cynical about politics when Clinton took over. I'm a proud member of the Green Party.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wise's aides clicked on the Wise2000 sites. Up came the site of Mr. Wise's Republican opponent, Gov. Cecil H. Underwood.</p>
        <p>They accused the governor of resorting to ''trickery'' and ''chicanery.''</p>
        <p>Governor Underwood denied any involvement. Yes, his aides reported, Mr. Loughery had approached the governor about buying the Wise2000 sites for $1,500 to ''damage'' Mr. Wise in a race considered a tossup. But, they said, the governor ignored the offer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Loughery says he has no comment, ''none at all.'' And the Wise2000 sites?</p>
        <p>Going into the weekend, clicking onto the sites brought up the Ralph Nader campaign site. Mr. Nader, the consumer advocate, is seeking the Green Party's presidential nomination.</p>
