        <p>WHEN you write about the movies, you get into situations, at parties or Little League games, where a parent guides you into a corner and signals the onset of serious conversation. No, it's not ''Brief Encounter'' or even a Ph.D.-level discussion about whether the earlier David Lean isn't more interesting than the master of epics. No, as the expert, a far heavier load is about to settle on your shoulders, and I want to admit here and now that it has changed the way I think about pictures.</p>
        <p>It's a 37-year-old mother who wants to know, ''Did you see 'The Matrix'?''</p>
        <p>''Sure,'' I say, stiffening, because when I took Nick, our 10-year-old, to see that film, I turned to him after  half an hour and said, ''I can't follow this story.'' And he hissed back: ''It doesn't matter. Just watch.''</p>
        <p>That moment made me jump. I mean, the dark at the movies is a constant, and sometimes a line of dialogue can pierce you. I knew I'd used that same shut-up answer once myself. I couldn't place it for a moment, but it came back: it was ''Vertigo,'' and I was 16, holding hands with a girlfriend, and she couldn't see whether it was one or two women Kim Novak was playing. ''It doesn't matter,'' I said. ''Just watch.'' And her hand, hurt, slipped out of mine. I admit it: I gave up the remote prospect of sex for Hitchcock and the raptures of screen. I've often thought Alfred's mind worked the same way.</p>
        <p>So I was wary when this mother mentioned ''The Matrix.'' Anyway, she was rattling on: ''Chip and I loved it'' -- Chip is Nick's friend -- ''and I was just wondering, because Chip said you had taken Nick to 'South Park,' the movie. And Nick has told him it's 'sensational.' ''</p>
        <p>''Right,'' I said grimly.</p>
        <p>''Well, you know Chip's dad and I are divorced. Would it be wiser for him to see it with me, do you think, or with his dad?''</p>
        <p>I was wondering how to ask whether she or her ex had the most fruitful clitoral conversations with Chip. But, thank God and save Kenny, a vicious foul ball broke up our tete-a-tete.</p>
        <p>Still, sooner or later, the same confounding questions are going to come back, and, every time, I get that terrible sinking feeling about the difference between seeing movies as a teenager in the 1950's and trying to supervise the same situation 40-plus years later.</p>
        <p>Let me say that these days, in the long summer season of gladiators, U-boats and unhindered teenage smut, your young ones have some quite advanced arts and strategies where leisure is concerned, and some of the sweet things can end up in the family way. Be warned.</p>
        <p>You see, the age of ''Vertigo'' had a lot to be said for it -- and I think that many films of that period have a chance of reaching kids now. After all, ''Vertigo'' worships sex. It's not just that it regards it as a big thing; it's everything.</p>
        <p>Indeed, I am personally quite open to the critical commentary that if its central character, Scottie Ferguson, could just have sex with someone, anyone (as opposed to worshiping it), he'd get over his fear of heights, there would be no unpleasantness in San Francisco, and no need for Kim Novak to die once, let alone twice. But the movie has as much dread of sex as adoration for it. As I said, I think this is genuinely important (and frivolously diverting) in any responsible discussion of Hitchcock -- and absolutely the sort of point film writers should be raising.</p>
        <p>But in the 1950's, especially in the mid- and late 50's, there was an extraordinary inner rhyming between what was happening (or not happening) on the screen and the sex-mad minds of kids like this writer. (We might have been less mad about sex if the screen had been more liberal.) In those far-off days, it was still impossible to show anything like sex, carnal contact or nudity on screen. It didn't matter; we kids saw it everywhere, anyway, and were all the more aroused and alert as voyeurs because of censorship's suppression. So in ''Vertigo,'' there's the scene where Scottie dives into the water off Fort Point to rescue Madeline from her ''suicide'' attempt. He takes her to his house (she has fainted -- or feinted). And when the next scene begins, she is bare-shouldered beneath a blanket, with her clothes hanging up to dry in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>I was in heaven, and I will never forget the half-shy, half-wolfish look Novak gave James Stewart when she realized he had undressed her. It was up to us, the kids, to wonder whether she was actually unconscious during this disrobing or keeping her eyes wide shut and enjoying her own kind of darkness. I say that only because -- as we connoisseurs now know -- Madeline is a trickster, an ''actress.'' So it's a delicate point, as in most good Hitchcock films, as to who is kidding whom.</p>
        <p>I  WRITE as one whose adolescence was passed in the era of ''Rear Window,''  ''To Catch a Thief'' (''Would you prefer a leg or a breast?'' asks Grace Kelly, albeit during a picnic that includes cold chicken. ''You decide,'' says Cary Grant, always elusive.) ''Vertigo'' and ''North by Northwest.'' Happy days! Those films are in so many ways all about sex, the idea of sex, and thus were perfectly aimed at me and others as dirty-minded. Yet maybe I am unduly harsh on myself. For those films were also very charitably adjusted to the hopes and dreams of a lad who wanted to have sex but was being generally encouraged by society to wait a little while yet. For the Hitchcock films suggested that sex was a very great thing, worth waiting for, and all the more awesome on account of our extended longing.</p>
        <p>There was a lovely comic edge to most Hitchcock (it may be the best thing about him, and the most mature, especially if he was as sexually unhappy as we are now led to believe). It was enough to make a virginal 16-year-old feel worldly wise. But the underlying pattern of arousal and frustration was part of a larger scheme in films of that age. They were intensely moral; they were about facing problems and solving them; they were about the virtue of finding your identity, your honor even, and living usefully because of it.</p>
        <p>You may notice that these are ideals and attitudes fit only for mockery now.</p>
        <p>But the films I loved were models for living. The westerns of Anthony Mann (''Winchester 73,''  ''Bend of the River,''  ''The Far Country,''  ''The Man From Laramie'') were about admitting and facing your flaws, being brave and socially responsible, and beating the guys who were only worse than you, not simply bad. The heartbreaking pictures of Nicholas Ray were about struggling to be independent, talking to your stupid parents until they found it in themselves to grow up, and existing in sweet friendship with Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo.</p>
        <p>I'm talking about ''Rebel Without a Cause,'' which was really the story of a 24-year-old high school kid who was more mature than his parents and needed to get them to admit it so that he could find peace and perfect happiness ever after with his Judy (Wood). They kissed (some of the most poignant mouthings in screen history) and that's all they did, no matter that, in fact, nearly everyone was in and out of bed with everyone else on that production. (The contrast between the real behavior and the modesty being offered may be one of the most crazed dislocations of the famously hypocritical 1950's.) ''Rebel'' was a very helpful film for kids in the 50's, just as Dean owed his glory to the way he flattered and indulged the very tender fantasies of his audience.</p>
        <p>''East of Eden'' is even more sublime or fanciful in that its World War I setting allows Cal's romance with Abra (Julie Harris) to be more idealized. But in that case Dean was the dark brother -- a version of Cain -- trying to win his idiot father's love, trying to endure the empty perfection of his brother, Aron. But Cal is emotionally honest: that's what you learn from the still superb scene in which he goes to find and talk to his ''evil'' mother (Jo Van Fleet). Then later he tells Aron about her, daring him to face the truth.</p>
        <p>So, if parents ask me to recommend films for kids who are 10 to 14, I often say try some of the 50's pictures, especially the ones that were most ''adult'' in their day: not just the Mann westerns or Dean's pictures but ''From Here to Eternity,''  ''Sweet Smell of Success,'' Fritz Lang's ''Big Heat,'' John Ford's ''Searchers,'' ''The Man With the Golden Arm'' (just say no), Stanley Kubrick's ''Killing,'' Vincente Minnelli's ''Lust for Life,'' Joshua Logan's ''Picnic,'' Samuel Fuller's ''Run of the Arrow,'' Douglas Sirk's ''Written on the Wind,'' Howard Hawks's ''Rio Bravo.''</p>
        <p>I appreciate that a lot of those films are black and white, which most kids now associate with the Stone Age. And they'll be able to see them now only on VCR. Worse than that, those films are packed with white lies, evasions and so forth. But they are good, or better, films than most of what we get now, and they are instructive entertainments, by which I mean that an adolescent is given a chance to dream and conjure with his or her future, all within a secure and positive moral framework.</p>
        <p>This argument may reduce you to tears of dismayed laughter. For who in this brave new world would really shut out the new and harp on the archaic for their own young? But here's where the problems become very real, and far more than funny. Lots of our kids are having sex (or the Clintonian variants that any lawyer could deny) younger than we know or suspect, in a climate of belief that finds it hard to relate that behavior to love, let alone marriage or honor. Even the use of such words may prompt ridicule. But if you are parent to anyone in those danger years when tenderness and hope risk being smothered by ''coolness,'' you know the anxiety on all sides.</p>
        <p>But we flinch from the rationalism of complete educational openness that says, well, if you're doing that, let's not fool ourselves, let's teach pleasure and orgy in the eighth grade, let's give kids video manuals on masturbation and make birth control as available as laptop computers. No, we're not yet that immodest, just as most parents -- even the most sexual of us -- are awkward explaining sex to our own young. We're sentimental about such things; we'd like experts to do it. We want the kids to find real love, and we are afraid of the possibility that sex can flower without love, that promiscuity and mere relief could be necessary habits. Natalie Wood couldn't have sex in ''Splendor in the Grass,'' and she went crazy. Is that what we want?</p>
        <p>MY nostalgia is not a complete answer, of course. But it's worth trying, and it could help keep some fine movies alive. The truth is that for years we have condoned a lazy rating system that exposes kids to insane violence and open sexuality, and that prefers a cynical attitude to both. In our house, we have only one rule: Nick has to talk about the films he sees. I showed him ''Psycho,'' the original. Forty years ago that was reckoned not just adult but as brazen as film could be. It didn't alarm Nick. He viewed the shower scene technically and as a kind of quaint throwback. But there's hope. He went off to bed saying that he thought the film was well written. It is, and he'd heard its talk. Norman Bates is still one of the most tender killers we've come up with. And Norman was in so many ways the end of the 50's, a warning note of growing up. Good luck.</p>
