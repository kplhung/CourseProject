        <p>Maritime history buffs and the just plain curious have been trickling into the Lake Geneva town of Morges, Switzerland, for the past four years to witness an odd bit of living history -- the construction of a 17th-century-style galley powered in part by sails and up to more than 200 oarsmen.</p>
        <p>The brainchild of Swiss shipbuilding enthusiasts, the 180-foot-long wooden vessel -- named La Liberte -- is being built by about 500 people, each of whom works on the project for an average of six months. After its completion and launch, planned for June 2001, the galley will be used for cruises on Lake Geneva and as a floating venue for cultural, sporting and educational activities.</p>

        <p>Maritime history buffs and the just plain curious have been trickling into the Lake Geneva town of Morges, Switzerland, for the past four years to witness an odd bit of living history -- the construction of a 17th-century-style galley powered in part by sails and up to more than 200 oarsmen.</p>
        <p>The brainchild of Swiss shipbuilding enthusiasts, the 180-foot-long wooden vessel -- named La Liberte -- is being built by about 500 people, each of whom works on the project for an average of six months. After its completion and launch, planned for June 2001, the galley will be used for cruises on Lake Geneva and as a floating venue for cultural, sporting and educational activities.</p>
        <p>La Liberte's design is based on 17th- and 18th-century plans and documents from the Musee de la Marine in Paris, with the addition of two motors for precise maneuvering. Sails and motors will be used on most voyages, but for nautical parades and shows the galley will be propelled by rowers.</p>
        <p>La Liberte's hangarlike shipyard is open to the public every day between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., and guides are on hand to answer questions. Admission is $2.90, free for children under 16. The shipyard is next to the lake on the east side of Morges, a picturesque town of 14,000 about 10 minutes by car from Lausanne. Information: (41-21) 803-5031.</p>
