        <p>WHEN French troops in Bosnia captured Momcilo Krajisnik last month, making him the highest-ranking Bonsian Serb in the custody of the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Western officials said his arrest was a warning to those suspects still at large that they could not sleep so easily any more.</p>
        <p>Last week, officials here and in The Hague sounded a lot less smug.</p>
        <p>Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic, the Yugoslav defense minister who was indicted for crimes committed during Serbia's campaign against Kosovo's Albanians, had just spent five days in Russia, where he was received as a dignitary despite the fact that international law obliged Russia to arrest the man.</p>
        <p>General Ojdanic's visit dismayed supporters of the tribunal, but there was little they or the State Department could do beside issue public condemnations.</p>
        <p>In fact, the visit underscored the fundamental frustration facing the tribunal. Despite its recent successes in arresting and trying war crimes suspects from the former Yugoslavia, the most senior military and political figures under indictment remain safely out of reach, starting with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>While they may have curtailed some activities -- Mr. Milosevic is unlikely to risk a trip abroad -- their status as the world's most wanted men has not scared them completely underground.</p>
        <p>A few weeks after Mr. Krajisnik's arrest, a respected Bosnian newsweekly published a detailed account of the comings and goings of Radovan Karadzic, the political leader of Bosnia's Serbs and also a wanted man. The same report said that Ratko Mladic, who commanded the Bosnian Serb army, often traveled from Serbia to visit his farm in Bosnia, where he keeps bees, despite the presence of 20,000 NATO-led peacekeepers. A month before, he had appeared at a soccer match in Belgrade -- with bodyguards.</p>
        <p>Frustration over the failure to catch these men prompted the State Department to print up thousands of ''Wanted'' posters, to be distributed in Bosnia, that offered $5 million for information about their whereabouts. The effort drew immediate derision -- and not just because the first batch was printed in English (a Serbo-Croatian version appeared later), or because it included a toll-free 800 telephone number that would work only in the United States.</p>
        <p>Sen. Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, wrote to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright saying he had ''the information you are looking for.'' He noted the most recent sightings of Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Mladic and even gave Mr. Milosevic's address: 15 Uzicka Street in Belgrade, the president's official residence. (Mr. Helms asked that the reward money go to a charity in North Carolina.)</p>
        <p>To be fair, it's natural that Serbia would become a haven for wanted Serbs. But Mr. Helms and some human-rights advocates accuse wary NATO peacekeepers of letting parts of Bosnia become havens too, out of fear that arrests would provoke retaliation from nationalists who support the suspects.</p>
