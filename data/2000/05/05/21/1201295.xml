        <p>THE Vatican's belated disclosure of the third secret of Fatima last week was a little like the F.B.I. announcing that Elvis is, in fact, dead.</p>
        <p>The revelation that the long-suppressed prophecy contained a vision of something that has already come to pass, the 1981 assassination attempt on John Paul II, deflated decades of conspiracy theories and doomsday predictions (nowadays broadcast on dozens of Fatima Web sites). Most third-secret devotees were skeptical.</p>
        <p>Fatima, revered by Roman Catholics as a place where the Virgin Mary appeared to three Portuguese shepherd children in 1917, has long held a broader fascination for people attracted to unsolved, spooky mysteries. Fatima addicts maintain that the third secret was so terrifying -- their conjectures ranging from schism to nuclear annihilation -- that no pope dared reveal it.</p>
        <p>And, as is so often the case when the Vatican lifts a veil to appease public opinion, it raises more questions. So many, in fact, that the Fatima mystery lives on: the  Vatican's effort to end tabloid sensationalism and cultish obsession has already spawned new conspiracy theories.</p>
        <p>And doubting Thomases. Father Nicholas Gruner, director of the Fatima Center in Fort Erie, Ontario, who has a quarterly magazine, ''Fatima Crusader'' and a Web site (www.fatima.org), has been lobbying for full disclosure since 1978. Immediately after the Vatican announcement last week, Father Gruner said in a press release: ''We pray that the original will be photographically reproduced for wide distribution.''</p>
        <p>The ''original'' is believed to be a handwritten description of the third secret by Sister Lucia de Santos, 93, the only surviving Fatima witness, who became a Carmelite nun. Sister Lucia declined to include the third part of the prophecy in her 1941 memoirs recounting the apparitions of the Virgin that, she said, began on May 13, 1917. (May 13 is also the date Mehmet Ali Agca shot the pope. John Paul II, who has visited Fatima three times, has credited the Virgin of Fatima with saving his life.)</p>
        <p>According to Fatima historians, Sister Lucia fell so ill in 1943 that her local bishop instructed her to write down the third secret. Too scared to read it himself, he sent it to Rome in 1957. Five popes declined to make the secret public -- until now.</p>
        <p>Last weekend at Fatima, on May 13, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican secretary of state, told 600,000 believers gathered to see the pope that the prophecy revealed to the shepherds was a vision of a ''bishop clothed in white'' who ''falls to the ground, amid the corpses of those who were martyred, apparently dead, under a burst of gunfire.'' He interpreted it as a prophecy of the 1981 shooting and said the Vatican would soon publish the secret, with a commentary.</p>
        <p>LAST Wednesday was the first time the pope has ever addressed the third secret. ''I thought it opportune to make public the contents of the so-called third part of the secret,'' he told believers at a general audience in St. Peter's Square.</p>
        <p>The Vatican has not yet explained why its experts are certain the vision referred to John Paul II and not, for example, to the white-robed archbishop of San Salvador, Oscar Arnulfo Romero, who was shot and killed by right-wing death squads on March 24, 1980, while celebrating Mass.</p>
        <p>But that interpretation would clash with Fatima's anti-Communist mystique. The first of the so-called Fatima secrets supposedly predicted the end of World War I and the coming of World War II. The second secret, believers say, augured that Soviet Communism would spread, then collapse and Russia would convert to Christianity. The latter vision made Fatima an ideological shrine for anti-Communists in the cold war, and the shooting of an anti-Communist Polish pope neatly fit the pattern.</p>
        <p>Scoffing at Wednesday's announcement as a ''made to measure revelation,'' Gian Enrico Rusconi, a political scientist at the University of Turin, wrote in the Turin daily La Stampa of the pope-centered revelation as ''frankly exaggerated.''</p>
        <p>Even some believers were disbelieving. ''It's disappointing,'' Julio Estela, 33, a Portuguese car salesman, said after the cardinal spoke. ''I think there is more.''</p>
        <p>He was not alone. ''I believe that the third secret also spoke of crises and divisions within the church since the Second Vatican Council,'' Rene Laurentin, a French monk and prominent theologian of the cult of Mary, told Italian reporters. The chief exorcist for the Diocese of Rome and the president of the International Association of Exorcists, Father Gabriele Amorth, said the announcement left him ''perplexed.''</p>
        <p>Political consultants gave the Vatican points for spin control. Fabrizio Rondolino, an adviser to former Prime Minister Massimo d'Alema, wrote in La Stampa, ''The dependency on ever greater doses of the supernatural, from Padre Pio to Fatima, responds to a strategic need of the church: to recuperate, in this way, the unconventional forms of contemporary spirituality.''</p>
        <p>PERHAPS the only person who took the Vatican announcement at face value besides the pope was his would-be Turkish assassin. Among the many conflicting statements Mr. Agca gave prosecutors in 1985 was a claim that the shooting ''is connected to the third secret of the Madonna of Fatima.''</p>
        <p>Since the disclosure, Mr. Agca has given interviews saying he acted alone -- up to a point. ''But Agca feels he was part of a larger design, something bigger than he,'' said his lawyer, Marina Magistrelli, who added that after the Vatican revelation, ''now perhaps more people will believe him.''</p>
