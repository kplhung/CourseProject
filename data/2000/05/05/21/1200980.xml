        <p>WHILE in London last fall, I was keenly aware of grumbling about Blair's Project, as Prime Minister Tony Blair's plan to modernize Britain is called. It even has a snappy theme, ''Cool Britannia.''</p>
        <p>Many Brits seem convinced that along with Mr. Blair's shaking up the House of Lords, banishing the fox hunt and financing the Millennium Dome, he is out to make them more American than British. For as they see it, his idea of modernity is all things American.</p>
        <p>''He wants us to show more of your American snap 'n dash'' is how my cabby put it as we drove down Piccadilly one afternoon. If that's so, he and many of his countrymen foresee an epidemic of psychic shock. And so do I. Because for me, the allure of Britain is the myriad ways in which it differs from my native country. The Americanization of London, for example, is a particularly chilling thought.</p>
        <p>For years, I've been bypassing that city's grand international hotels in favor of its ''baby grands,'' with their blend of laid-back, tea-cozy charm that makes a stay a very personal, uniquely British experience. I'm one of their army of devotees who book so frequently that if I leave a personal item behind, it will be stored away until my next visit.</p>
        <p>I was fresh out of college when I arrived in London the first time. And it also happened to be the first time that all of its bright lights were finally blazing since the end of the war four years earlier. ''Our brownout's history now,'' the cabby said that evening as he deposited me outside the Goring Hotel, a block or two from the garden wall of Buckingham Palace. (It was a Goring who, in 1642 or thereabouts, built his home on what later became the site of the palace.)</p>
        <p>What had originally decided me on this family-owned hotel was the assurance of a well-traveled friend that it had ''soul.'' During the war, he said, when fuel was severely restricted, many of the landed gentry closed their homes and took up residence at the Goring for the winter. He thought it probably was the echo of the hotel's home-awayfrom-home past that accounted for its soul.</p>
        <p>On this trip, I made a sentimental visit to the Goring (by now, I've circulated among a number of baby grands) to have lunch with a British friend far too young to have been around during the brownout. In fact, he had never heard of it.</p>
        <p>I entered the elegant little lobby with some trepidation. I'd heard that the Goring had undergone an extensive renovation. Well, the bar was three times bigger than I remembered it. And the lounge, brightened by a grand pewter chandelier, had little cards scattered about to remind us ''out of consideration for others'' not to use our mobile phones. But despite having been spiffed up, the hotel still had its soul.</p>
        <p>Of course, this isn't the first time British propriety has been under siege. In 1969, exactly 20 years after my first visit, I was  living in London and working for an American advertising agency in an office with a window overlooking Berkeley Square. All London was rocking to what the tabloids dubbed a Youth Quake. Young Brits sporting unisex bobs were flocking to scruffy-looking Carnaby Street, where the musicblaring boutiques were selling miniskirts, bell bottoms and psychedelic beads.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, I was doing everything I could to distance myself from Carnaby Street and all that it represented. Most days, I carried a furled umbrella to work, and had lunch (roast beef, Yorkshire pudding and a pint of lager) at Rules, established in 1798 and a place of dark wood paneling and plush banquettes. I had moved into a sliver of a house (three stories high, one room to a floor) in a mews in Shepherd Market, a nest of twisting streets that resembled an old market town  whimsically set down in the very heart of upper-crust Mayfair. Shepherd's House 5C was my refuge from Swinging London.</p>
        <p>Evenings, I stayed home and wrote, typing on a manual typewriter in a postage- stamp-sized living room with wood-burning fireplace. With my book advance, I bought a custom-made suit on Savile Row.</p>
        <p>It was in the evening, when the street lights came on and the archways and squat buildings rose up in half shadow, that I could best imagine Shepherd Market's sophisticated past. In the 1920's, it was an ultrafashionable address for some of London's pedigreed flappers and bachelors, who lived there like characters in a play by the young Noel Coward, the new West End sensation. It must have seemed inevitable when Michael Arlen chose it as the setting for his best seller ''The Green Hat,'' which went on to become a hit Broadway play and a film starring Greta Garbo.</p>
        <p>Sundays, I practically had the market to myself (few people actually lived there) until dusk, when the pubs and restaurants snapped on their lights and opened their doors. But early on weekday mornings, housewives arrived wearing modish hats and white gloves with baskets hooked over their arms to buy fruits and vegetables from the itinerant greengrocers.</p>
        <p>After church, I would sit in a vest-pocket park a short stroll away and read The Times of London. Encircling an oval of grass, each of its sturdy wooden benches bore a brass plaque courtesy of visitors, mostly Americans, who wanted to celebrate the peaceful days enjoyed there.</p>
        <p>Across the street from the park is a stationery store where I regularly purchased typing paper and typewriter ribbons. I made it a point to revisit it for I had pleasant memories of a particular saleswoman -- a middle-aged woman who always wore a spotless blue smock over her dress and somehow made you feel that her happiness and the customer's satisfaction were one and the same.</p>
        <p>During my recent visit, I found the store's shelves lined with laptop computers. A young woman working there couldn't recall my friend. ''But then, I've been here for less than a year,'' she told me.</p>
        <p>Propelled by a wave of nostalgia, I visited a number of other favorite places in the next few days. I took a bus to Eton and found, as usual, its narrow streets flooded with students hurrying along in their swallow-tailed coats and stiff wing collars. I saw no sign of American snap 'n dash.</p>
        <p>I had tea at Brown's Hotel, another of London's baby grand hotels. It too had had a very recent facelift. And although its new restaurant is being celebrated for its French cuisine, and a slick magazine said ''there's a new kick in the dowager,'' I was happy to find that Brown's acres of chintz and mahogany paneling remain.</p>
        <p>Named for Lord Byron's gentleman's gentleman, James Brown, and known as the only hotel in London in which Queen Victoria ever set foot, I rather think that Brown's would still merit the royal stamp of approval. Roger Morton, its head valet, and an employee for 44 years, is generally credited for seeing to that. Mr. Morton pressed for the decision to restore the iron railing outside the hotel to the pale gray color it was the day of the queenly visit over 100 years ago.</p>
        <p>My last evening in London, I sat perched on a stool in the cocktail lounge of the Chesterfield, another favorite hotel, as the resident pianist played a medley of Coward songs. A second martini, and I had to resist the urge to skip dinner and go straight to my old sliver of a house that still stands in the mews in Shepherd Market.</p>
        <p>Granted that Mr. Blair may be right about the House of Lords (unjust and outdated), and the fox hunt (barbaric), I think he's all wrong if he's set on the Americanization of his country. But then I remind myself that flamboyant Carnaby Street eventually faded away, and that the British  survived the blitz with their good manners and gentle eccentricities intact.</p>
        <p>All of which brings to mind the old Groucho Marx wisecrack about not wanting to belong to any club that would accept him as a member. Certainly, I would have second thoughts about flying across the Atlantic to put down some place where the natives are just like me.</p>
