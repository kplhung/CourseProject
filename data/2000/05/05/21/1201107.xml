        <p>THE Impressionists of the late 19th century brought to the fore a fresh way of using oil paints to capture color, light and atmosphere. They drew and painted on site -- in parks, on riverbanks and on street corners, resulting in some of the art world's most popular images.</p>

        <p>THE Impressionists of the late 19th century brought to the fore a fresh way of using oil paints to capture color, light and atmosphere. They drew and painted on site -- in parks, on riverbanks and on street corners, resulting in some of the art world's most popular images.</p>
        <p>For the most part, they were a cohesive bunch, pooling their ideas to capture everyday events and the changing effects of shimmering sunlight. In their paintings, they used lively colors and bold brush strokes to convey their ''impressions'' of the physical world, and they made the earth's natural beauty a primary subject.</p>
        <p>Today, and especially in these warmer months, local artists continue this trend of working in the open air, capturing the natural beauty of Westchester and Putnam Counties.</p>
        <p>Using cameras, watercolors and pencils and pads, Lisa Turchi Diebboll and Joseph F. Diebboll create their initial studies of nature on forays through the Hudson Highlands Park system in Putnam County. These depictions are then expanded upon and manipulated with both traditional media and computers, resulting in Impressionistic-looking Iris prints.</p>
        <p>Though they collaborate with respect to technical and aesthetic decisions, their work is distinctly different. Ms. Diebboll's work is more intimate than that of her husband. Her prints of Little Stony Point Park are more personal and fleeting than her husband's more literal landscapes. ''The Highlands are unlike any other area along the Hudson,'' she said. ''There is something about the landscape in and around Cold Spring, which seems to draw artists to this area.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Diebboll has more interest in the history of the Highlands Region. He often begins with the photographs he takes while hiking, later manipulating the images in the computer.</p>
        <p>Some of the computer effects he creates by using the Photoshop program are based on historic depictions of the same vistas he finds in museums and in the illustrations in his readings. ''It's a great way to learn the history of the area,'' he said. ''I occasionally go out, looking for something specific, looking at my map and thinking that a particular hill should provide me with a good view of Storm King or Break Neck Mountain, for instance. And usually, the Hudson River will be included in that view.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Diebboll said: ''For me, it's not so much about the view. It's more about the experience of the hike. It's about the color, the light, and the feeling of the moment.''</p>
        <p>A Peekskill artist, Larry D'Amico, has spent a large part of his life making sketches, pastels, paintings and photographs of both sides of the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>Over the last four decades, the river has been where he has gone swimming, fished and spent family summer vacations. He remembers with great fondness the days when he and his brother would dig along the banks of the river at Croton Point Park, where they would find  American Indian artifacts that the Senesqua children had left behind many years before.</p>
        <p>''Those childhood experiences grounded me to the landscape,'' he said. ''Later on, in my teens, I began to look at parks like Rockwood, and I wanted to capture not just the physical appearance of the landscape, but the underlying forces at play. I had then, and still do today, a strong sense of respect for the earth. From an artist's standpoint, I think it's that intense desire to capture those momentary glimpses on canvas so I could share them with others.''</p>
        <p>To illustrate this point, Mr. D'Amico referred to his current project: a painting that stands incomplete against one wall of his studio. ''I've done this same view at Rockwood repeatedly, over the past 20 years,'' he said. ''Each time it is different. There are the actual physical changes created by park maintenance workers and, of course, the natural cycle of nature. I am changing as well, and my memories of this place affect what I take from it. It's about the vision and how my impressions of a place change with time. The method I use to capture that vision, whether it be a pastel, a drawing or a more formal oil painting, is secondary.''</p>
        <p>For the last 20 years, Tony C. Wilkinson of Mamaroneck has created art at the Marshlands Conservancy in Rye. ''The Marshlands encourages artists to work there,'' he explained. ''Twice a year, they mount group shows of art created or conceived there.''</p>
        <p>What Mr. Wilkinson depicts in his paintings and drawings of the Marshlands Conservancy is varied. Working in either gouache, watercolors or color pencil, he creates landscapes, seascapes and floral or wildlife studies. ''One day I might find myself working in an open field, and the next time, I am content to paint among the trees,'' he said. ''Other times, I can be inspired by the shoreline which overlooks Milton Harbor, or by an egret which happens by.</p>
        <p>''It's a quiet place, and it's always changing. It's perfect any time of the year.</p>
        <p>''My primary intent is to translate the atmosphere of the Marshlands. The subtle differences in the colors relative to time of day is a big part of that. I guess that is the Impressionist in me.</p>
        <p>''Over time, I have come to think of it as a getaway or a retreat. It's a break from the problems of everyday life. Nature is bigger than all that; it surrounds us. That makes me feel at ease.''</p>
        <p>As an artist, Lois Palestine of Rye is familiar with the allure of the Marshlands Conservancy, though she now finds her muse at Playland Amusement Park.</p>
        <p>For the last decade, Ms. Palestine has been photographing the rides, the Art Deco architecture and some of the more nondescript outer reaches of Playland, mostly in black and white. ''Sometimes, it's the unusual angles of the framework of the roller coaster rides,'' she said. ''Other times it's the tertiary details of the grounds in general, which largely go unnoticed, that draw my attention. There is an energy to this place: the noise and the throngs of people in the summer months -- that is an experience in itself.''</p>
        <p>She added, ''In the off season, it's the quiet meanderings of the local senior citizens as they sun themselves along the boardwalk that inspires me.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Palestine, who was co-curator of a summer show of regional artists for the Gallery at Macy Pavilion in Valhalla, said: ''It is not unusual to find area painters and photographers working in Playland year round. It's a great place. Sometimes, I go there just to experience the weather, to observe a storm as it comes off the the Long Island Sound. It's invigorating. Playland is unlike any other place in the county.''</p>
        <p>To learn more about the work of the Diebbolls, the number to call at the Highland Studio is (914) 265-3761. Mr. D'Amico can be reached at (914) 734-1292.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilkinson's studio number is (914) 381-1961. Ms. Palestine can be reached at (212) 758-0850. Playland and the Marshlands Conservancy are part of the county's Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation. Hudson Highlands and Rockwood are state parks.</p>
