        <p>THANDIE NEWTON, the British actress who will be seen on screen under John Woo's direction inflaming the passions of three men with chiseled jaws (including Tom Cruise) when ''M:i-2,'' the ''Mission: Impossible'' sequel, opens on Wednesday, does not so much enter the cafe of the Four Seasons Hotel here as materialize. One minute the circular foyer is empty. The next, it contains a slight, straight-haired young woman, bare-legged below a slim black skirt, wearing red flip-flops and no apparent makeup. It's a dancer's entrance more than an actress's, both in its reliance on the eloquence of line and carriage and in its air of waiting for the music to begin. And though at 11 a.m. on a foggy May morning the cafe is nearly deserted, and the young woman unassumingly pretty and visibly pregnant, those heads that are present turn. It is suddenly no longer possible to be unaware of the difference between ''at rest'' and ''in motion.''</p>
        <p>That the 27-year-old Ms. Newton, who intended to be a dancer and trained intensively from ages 11 to 16, commands a body language that rivals in precision her Cambridge-educated English (she took her degree in anthropology) will surprise no one who saw her in Bernardo Bertolucci's ''Besieged'' (1998). As an African medical student supporting her studies in Rome by housecleaning for an expatriate British pianist (David Thewlis), Ms. Newton conveyed, in a single slow twist of her fingers across her lips, as much fascination with an alien culture, as much awareness of the temptations of both losing and affirming oneself through desire, as the passionate declarations of Mr. Thewlis's character.</p>
        <p>''Oh, that's my mum,'' Ms. Newton, who was born in Zaire and raised in England, the daughter of a Zimbabwean mother and a Cornish father, says of her accent and gestures in ''Besieged.''  ''I would sit watching, especially in the mornings, when she would just get up out of bed and put on her cloth in such a swift movement.'' Ms. Newton's hands fly to her left shoulder, sketch the motion of tying.</p>
        <p>The physical nature of her acting was even more apparent -- or more extreme -- in ''Beloved,'' Jonathan Demme's 1998 film version of Toni Morrison's novel. Ms. Newton portrayed the title character, a ghost child of a grieving former slave (played by Oprah Winfrey), as a ravenous, barely articulate toddler encased in a woman's body and attempting to operate its unfamiliar lips and limbs as awkwardly as a novice might try to master stilts. ''You can do so much if you are uninhibited with your body,'' Ms. Newton says. ''And your voice. To me, there's a melody behind every character's speech pattern.''</p>
        <p>Were the physical risks she took in ''Beloved,'' which included being covered with bugs and mud, an adequate preparation for making an action picture like ''M:i-2''? Quite the opposite, she says. The experience of making the latter film ''was strangely cosseting'' despite the explosions. ''Sometimes I felt quite frustrated,'' she continues, ''because it really comes down to insurance. You have to be healthy the next day to work. And a lot of the stunts required real training. There was one sequence where I had to fall off a cliff. You'd think it would feel incredibly risky, but really you're confined by the technicality of what you're doing. There's ropes and pulleys and cables and harnesses. And what I found difficult was trying to perform in a way where I felt free, when in reality I felt more contained than I've ever felt before.''</p>
        <p>This from a woman who spent most of one film, ''Gridlock'd,'' in a coma.</p>
        <p>''And I never touched a gun, not once,'' she concludes in only half-mock regret. ''I could have had one of Tom's at least. He was going around with eight, all over himself.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Newton's own life might also be described as poised, although rather more happily and without necessity of harness, on the edge of a divide. She has made a film a year since she was 16, beginning with John Duigan's coming-of-age memoir of Australian boarding school life, ''Flirting'' (in which, prophetically, she starred opposite Nicole Kidman, who is married to Mr. Cruise). But while there has been no shortage of intriguing characters to play, nor of on-screen advances from leading men including Brad Pitt (''Interview With the Vampire''), Nick Nolte (''Jefferson in Paris'') and the rapper Tupac Shakur (''Gridlock'd''), the cinematic equivalent of a global positioning device has continued to find Ms. Newton in roles specific to her skin color.</p>
        <p>This, she insists, has not been a detriment: ''People say, 'Oh, you've played a slave girl three times,' but I say: 'Get over it. Just look at the films.' They're all completely different.'' Indeed, the giddy joy and earthy practicality she brings to Thomas Jefferson's teenage slave-mistress, Sally Hemings, is as far from the halfhuman Beloved as the heroin-addicted poet of ''Gridlock'd'' is from the glamorous thief, Nyah, in ''M:i-2.'' And one thing she's discovered playing slaves: ''As far as accent, it's not that difficult to go from English to Southern. It's much more difficult to go from English to contemporary American.''</p>
        <p>BUT ''M:i-2,'' with its blockbuster profile, balletic pyrotechnics (a specialty of Mr. Woo, one of the chief architects of Hong Kong action films) and, perhaps most important, the magnesium flare of its love scenes, presages stardom of a whole other magnitude. And there is a delicious irony in that, for Ms. Newton seems about to be liberated, in a casting sense, by that most hidebound of traditional genres, the spy-thriller, free at last to play any intelligently beautiful female by the sort of movie she calls, in her best Oxbridge drawl, ''a popcorn flick.''</p>
        <p>The process of acculturation began when she went to see Mr. Woo's ''Face/Off'' with her husband, the English screenwriter Ol Parker. ''He loves those films,'' she says. ''And I came out thinking, 'Why did I like that?' It's an action film that I'm actually still thinking about.'' Further preconceptions were shattered when she met with Mr. Woo and Mr. Cruise in London: ''I thought I would be told, you know, 'Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to play this role -- like this.' But John was insistent that he wanted it to be a love story and the two of them together were adamant that the strength of the female character was going to be a departure in this genre of film. So I was sitting in the middle of these conversations feeling quite happy. Make her as strong as you want! Somehow race never came up. They talked more about cultural differences in terms of locations. I said to John, 'How do you see this character?' He said, 'She's a butterfly.' That was my preparation from John for the movie. I loved that.''</p>
        <p>''I admit I did get quite frustrated,'' Ms. Newton continues, sounding for the moment less like Blithe Spirit and more like Katharine Hepburn in ''The African Queen.''  ''Before the film started I wrote pages and pages of back-story and I had to throw it all away. Because who the character was meant nothing at all. Where she was from meant nothing. Everything's about the moment. The instincts of the characters, how they respond to the situation. Which is one of the reasons why John's films are so exciting. In fact, the way I looked at it -- my husband actually gave me this map which was very useful -- he said, 'Imagine each scene as a separate film.' So I threw away all of the notes'' -- her voice turns gently self-mocking -- ''and trying to build the arc of the character. Really there wasn't a whole lot I could do, other than be open to change and be at the mercy of the story. It was quite mythical in a way.''</p>
        <p>ASKED to contemplate the future from her present vantage point -- which is, in some ways, as serenely, anonymously, betwixt and between as the cafe's coolly impersonal foyer -- Ms. Newton gravitates to the domestic, preferring to talk about the house she and her husband have bought but not yet moved into in North London; the child due in September (''I'm looking forward to the birth itself''); the movie she began shooting in London four days after ''M:i-2'' wrapped (''It Was An Accident,'' from a script by her husband).</p>
        <p>Pressed, she concedes, ''I've been resisting the idea that my career will change, because I've had it before -- 'Ah, this is going to catapult you here, there and everywhere' and it doesn't really happen like that.'' An affair with her first director, Mr. Duigan (she was still a teenager; he was in his 40's), rankles. ''Getting into the film business that young wasn't terrific. It is exploitative and there is a cut-off point. At the end of a shoot everyone disperses and you're left hanging. For me, coming from school and that sort of teacher-student dynamic, it was in the fabric of my being that I would say yes to a question.''</p>
        <p>However painful personally, that compliance is something Ms. Newton has learned to use as an actress. Not merely a matter of the slow small smile that unfolds across her face in moments of cinematic acquiescence; nor of the faint shiver of the skin below her eyes that registers conflicting emotions, it also draws on a dancer's in-the-bone awareness of the pivotal instant in which the mover becomes the moved.</p>
        <p>And like most forms of freedom, it relies for its fullest expression upon the knowledge of constraint. ''In work,'' she muses, ''it doesn't bother me in the slightest. Bugs in the mouth. I just lock into fearlessness. But in life I'm icky about creatures. Isn't that funny? To feel safe when working and not in life? But it's different now. I'm in a nice period of pregnancy. Suddenly, I'm not logical. I forget things all the time.'' Her voice goes husky, full of wonder, pauses a beat. ''And it's liberating. I think when you are called to protect something, a child, instinctively you feel more powerful.''</p>
