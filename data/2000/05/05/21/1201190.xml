        <p>THE snow fence is the clue.</p>
        <p>Maybe once each summer, when a crowd pushes out toward the fence at the perimeter of Heckscher Park, the Huntington Arts Council knows it has a hit.</p>
        <p>The ground is covered with 8,000 concertgoers and their blankets and beach chairs. Some even bring folding tables, candles and elaborate picnic baskets in homage to Tanglewood. They have come to partake of the free entertainment available six nights a week at the park.</p>
        <p>Similar musical feasts take place throughout the Island, from West Hempstead to Southampton, almost every night, weather permitting, from late June until late August. The audiences range from 150 gathered at a cozy neighborhood green to hear a country music band to more than 40,000 who mob Heckscher State Park in East Islip to listen to the New York Philharmonic.</p>
        <p>The quality of the shows can be amateurishly quaint or professionally polished, and the content is just as varied. But the fun is casual, not to mention free.</p>
        <p>Summer park concerts had their roots in community bands. It was informal, light entertainment, a way to escape the heat inside the house.</p>
        <p>In some villages, community music groups still reign, made up of students, retirees and music teachers or performers with time on their hands. Such ensembles appear regularly in Huntington, Northport, Sag Harbor and Smithtown.</p>
        <p>But many people want more. So Nassau County, the towns and local arts councils hire some big names, like Odetta, who opens the season at Heckscher Park in Huntington June 23, or the New York Pops with Skitch Henderson, playing June 24 in Farmingville. On July 29, the New York Philharmonic is playing Heckscher for the 23rd time.</p>
        <p>Veteran performers are a mainstay, like the Coasters in Huntington June 24 and at Point Lookout July 2; Julius LaRosa (July 19) and Nipsey Russell (July 26) in Woodbury; the Capris in New Hyde Park July 28 and Bayville July 2; and Buddy Greco on Aug. 1 in Massapequa.</p>
        <p>Local talent is also featured. This includes the Long Island Philharmonic, which will play four concerts, having added two at Bald Hill Cultural Park in Farmingville to its usual Eisenhower and Heckscher Parks outings. There are also professionals like David Sear, the folk singer, who will appear at Clark Garden July 25, or Buddy Merriam and Back Roads, a bluegrass ensemble, which plays in Huntington July 23 and Southampton Aug. 16.</p>
        <p>The entertainment can be strictly avocational, like the Island Hill Chorus or the Long Island Banjo Society.</p>
        <p>The Huntington Arts Council, financed mostly by the Huntington general fund, will spend $113,000 on 56 presentations for its 35th anniversary season. Hempstead's budget for 17 neighborhood concerts and its fireworks concert July 2 is $35,000 raised from local corporations, while North Hempstead will spend $44,000 on 25 concerts.</p>
        <p>With $16,000 from a foundation and local companies, the Westhampton Cultural Consortium will stage nine concerts. The Southampton Cultural Center will mount nine concerts for $18,000 from private and business sources.</p>
        <p>Performers' fees can be as little as a $100 honorarium and as much as the $120,000 it costs the Islip Arts Council to bring the New York Philharmonic to Heckscher Park.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, a presenting organization foots the bill. The ethnic evenings that have become staples at Eisenhower Park are booked and paid for by the sponsoring groups. The Folk Music Society of Huntington has partly underwritten Ramblin' Jack Elliot on July 29.</p>
        <p>The acts are booked through talent agents, professional groups like the Performing Arts Network, informal networking among the people on the Island who do the programming and word of mouth from audience members.</p>
        <p>''We have a large senior group that comes to our concerts,'' said Mary Mahaffey, program coordinator for North Hempstead. ''And they're a smart audience that knows what's good in neighboring towns, and what's free. If they see something they like, they let me know. That's how I booked Kenny Dino to open my season at Bar Beach on July 2. Someone heard them and I got their tape and it blew my mind.'' (Kenny Dino is also appearing at Oceanside Park Aug. 3.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Mahaffey said her audience also lets her know when an act doesn't work. ''They start moving around and don't come back after intermission,'' she said. ''When that happens I don't rebook the act.''</p>
        <p>Soloists rarely perform in the larger parks. ''We need a lot of powerful instruments to be heard,'' Ms. Mahaffey said. ''Big band music and doo-wop carry very well.''</p>
        <p>In some towns, the programming follows the population. Klezmer goes over well in Lawrence, with its large Jewish population; a tribute to Mario Lanza plays West Hempstead, with its Italian flavor.</p>
        <p>''The idea is to give our people variety, entertain them in parks sprinkled around the town so they won't have to travel very far,'' said Steven Bellone, a member of the Babylon Town Board, who oversees the Parks Department. ''I remember as a kid in the 70's going to concerts in the parks. It's one of my best memories. And that's what we want give today's residents, entertainment and great memories.''</p>
