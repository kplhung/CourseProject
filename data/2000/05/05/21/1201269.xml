        <p>Like the girl in the Rolling Stones song, they come in colors everywhere. The purple ones carry the Employment Journal. The yellow ones carry brochures for the Learning Annex. And the green ones carry copies of The New York Press, along with a collection of paper cups and soda bottles that are all too easy to rest on their flat tops.</p>
        <p>They are newspaper and catalog distribution boxes, and residents say they have had enough of them.</p>
        <p>''In the last couple of months, there's really been an explosion of them in all shapes, sizes and colors,'' said Craig Hammerman, district manager for Community Board 6, which includes the neighborhoods of Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens and Park Slope. ''It's not uncommon to see four or five of them all chained to the same street-light pole.''</p>
        <p>Franklin Stone, president of the Cobble Hill Association, said the situation had become dangerous. ''We now have so many that they constitute a hazard for pedestrians trying to pass by,'' she said, adding,  ''They're particularly unsightly in a landmark district.''</p>
        <p>Last month, after Community Board 6 wrote to the city about the issue, Dashiell Flynn, associate borough director for Brooklyn in the mayor's office, replied that the boxes were unregulated and protected under the First Amendment. ''They proposed contacting all the individual vendors responsible for placing them there,'' Mr. Hammerman said. ''It was a disappointing response, to say the least.''</p>
        <p>Gabriel Taussig, a lawyer for the city, explained that in the early 90's the city banned use of the boxes for purely commercial publications -- such as advertising fliers -- but that the New York State Court of Appeals found the regulations unconstitutional. ''They said commercial speech is also protected by the First Amendment,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Michelle Jaffe, executive director of the Learning Annex, an educational center, said the boxes were a good way to advertise.</p>
        <p>Asked about complaints, Ms. Jaffe said, ''We get calls now and then. We look at the situation and if we feel that the box is an obstruction for anyone's walking, we're happy to move it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hammerman said he was not concerned with whether the boxes were put out by commercial enterprises or news organizations.</p>
        <p>''A box is a box is a box,'' he said. He added, ''For people who've called in to complain, we've said they're welcome to try removing the boxes  themselves. We warn them that they could get charged with vandalism, but it might be a way of forcing the issue.''</p>
