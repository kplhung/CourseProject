        <p>When he was a boy growing up in west-central Mexico, Jesus Lopez and his brothers would load agave leaves onto the backs of donkeys and haul them to factories to be converted into tequila. Along the way, he would dream of living in a place with electricity and abundant water.</p>
        <p>But the dream never included Detroit. Mr. Lopez had not even heard of it until the day that his brothers and many in Jesus Maria, his hometown, packed their bags and headed to America's Motor City. When an 18-year-old Jesus Lopez arrived here, he said recently, he was convinced that those who had come before him were crazy.</p>
        <p>''In those days, over here there was only burned-out houses,'' he recalled. ''Who would want to live here? It was not good.''</p>
        <p>But today, 18 years later, the view is much different in southwest Detroit, where many of this city's immigrants from Mexico live. So much has changed that it is being hailed as the nation's new Mexican boomtown.</p>
        <p>Scorched shells of houses are being bought and resurrected by scores of skilled Mexican tradesmen. They have snapped up dozens of the old Victorians and duplexes for as little as $20,000, and they have nearly doubled the population to 90,000.</p>
        <p>Their impact is undeniable. The three local Roman Catholic parishes have each added two weekend Masses in Spanish to accommodate the wave of new arrivals, who started showing up here six years ago, most directly from Mexico. They say they came to escape rising costs and growing hostilities against immigrants in Arizona, California and Chicago, and to reunite with older relatives who had been cashing in on Detroit's labor shortage for more than a decade.</p>
        <p>West Vernor Avenue, the main strip here, is lined with evidence: Mexican bakeries, paleta (Popsicle) shops, taquerias, tortilla factories, Mexican grocery stores. Since 1994, about 35 businesses have opened and dozens have expanded, business groups said. An $8 million mercado and welcome center will be built next year. Amid the abundance of Spanish signs, it is easy to overlook the golden arches of McDonald's.</p>
        <p>''Nobody over here saw the opportunity we did,'' said Mr. Lopez, who left a 10-year construction career five months ago to open his own taqueria. ''Where we come from, you work all your life to have a house, a business, and you still don't get nowhere. That's why we work hard to make this good for us.''</p>
        <p>The Rev. Donald Hanchon of Most Holy Redeemer Catholic Church said: ''These are people who are determined to be an asset. You see it in the churches, where they're helping with children and services. They genuinely want to make this a better place.''</p>
        <p>Father Hanchon said he believed that the renovation of run-down houses here was forcing drug dealers to find new dens.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Lopez, the majority of the families settling here come from villages in Jalisco, the Mexican state renowned for producing tequila, mariachi music and rancheros, Mexican cowboys. More than 40,000 of the people who live in southwest Detroit are either from Jalisco or have relatives there, said Maria Elena Rodriguez, who is a Detroit native and president of the Mexicantown Community Development Corporation.</p>
        <p>Some of the businesses are named to honor Jalisco and its towns, like Arandas, Jesus Maria and San Ignacio. The connection is so strong that caravans of adults and children load up their cars each January and return to the towns to celebrate las fiestas patronales, a 10-day festival held in honor of patron saints.</p>
        <p>''We go back, so they know we are proud to be from Mexico, from Jalisco,'' said Guadalupe Guzman, 70, who moved here to work in the steel factories in 1950. He and his family return to Jesus Maria every year.</p>
        <p>It took two decades for 32-year-old Jose Zamudio to believe the stories that his brothers and sisters told about the untapped opportunities in Detroit. Even after five of them came here from San Ignacio, bought homes and found steady jobs, Mr. Zamudio refused to follow.</p>
        <p>''It was too ugly,'' he said. Mr. Zamudio and his wife, Anna, chose instead to go to Oakland, Calif. But after four years of working for $10 an hour and living in cramped apartments, they gave up and moved back to Mexico. They built a home and had three children.</p>
        <p>Then two years ago, when the whole family had obtained visas, they decided to give the United States another try, in Chicago this time. They stayed three months. The pressure of having five people in a $600-a-month one-room apartment was too much. Now they are gambling on Detroit.</p>
        <p>So far, their gamble has paid off. Mr. Zamudio is earning $18 an hour as a bricklayer for a construction company. Six months ago, he and his wife bought a three-bedroom duplex for $40,000. But what thrills Mr. Zamudio most is seeing how much his family -- 5 brothers and sisters and 19 nieces and nephews -- and others from back home have done to help rebuild southwest Detroit.</p>
        <p>''Look at it, it's like little Jalisco,'' he said. ''We never knew people of our towns building this kind of business. They show if you fight and fight, you reach your dreams.''</p>
