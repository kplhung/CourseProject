        <p>Rickey Henderson hit a home run in his first at-bat for the Mariners, but Tampa Bay stopped its six-game losing streak with a 4-3 victory in Seattle.</p>
        <p>Henderson, who made his Mariners debut as a pinch-runner the previous night, hit his major league-record 76th leadoff home run. Signed Wednesday night after being released by the Mets, he went 1 for 3 with two walks.</p>
        <p>Seattle trailed, 4-2, in the seventh when Mark McLemore charged the mound and tackled Tampa Bay starter Esteban Yan (2-1) after an inside pitch. The plate umpire, Bill Welke, called time as Yan was delivering, which might have thrown off the pitch. McLemore was unaware that time was called.</p>
        <p>Players from both benches and dugouts emptied onto the field and there was about a five-minute melee at the mound. Yan and McLemore were ejected, as was Mariners reliever Arthur Rhodes. The skirmish interrupted play for about 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>In the eighth, players came back on the field when Mike DiFelice of Tampa Bay squared to bunt and Jose Paniagua's pitch was inside. DiFelice fouled it off, and the first base coach Jose Cardenal ran in to stop DiFelice from going out to the mound.</p>
        <p>Seattle had its season-high four-game winning streak stopped. Despite allowing a run in the eighth on consecutive doubles by John Olerud and Edgar Martinez, Roberto Hernandez pitched the final two innings for his third save.</p>
        <p>Henderson made his first at-bat in a Mariners uniform a memorable one. He hit a 1-1 pitch 366 feet to left field for his 279th career homer.</p>
        <p>TIGERS 2, RED SOX 1: Juan Gonzalez hit a tie-breaking homer in the sixth inning as Detroit won in Boston.</p>
        <p>Gonzalez, who doubled and hit his fourth homer in four games, is 9 for 20 with six runs batted in in his last five games.</p>
        <p>''He started swinging the bat well in Cleveland,'' Tigers Manager Phil Garner said. ''We can rally around him if he keeps swinging the bat.''</p>
        <p>Gonzalez, the first batter reliever Tim Wakefield (1-3) faced, hit his eighth homer. The shot cleared the screen above the left-field wall.</p>
        <p>''I'm seeing the ball really well,'' Gonzalez said. ''I made a couple of adjustments with my mechanics. I'm feeling more comfortable. The thing I need now is more men on base.''</p>
        <p>The Red Sox had tied the score at 1-1 in the fifth, but poor base running cost them a run.</p>
        <p>With the bases loaded, Dave Mlicki wild-pitched a run home. Carl Everett then hit a fly ball to Bobby Higginson, who doubled up Brian Daubach at second base before Trot Nixon tagged and reached home.</p>
        <p>''I was assuming Nixon would score,'' Higginson said. ''I was trying to get a double play to end the inning. Having him not score was a bonus.</p>
        <p>Boston had beaten the Tigers in five of six games this year, shutting them out three times.''</p>
        <p>TWINS 3, ATHLETICS 0: Eric Milton pitched three-hit ball for eight innings as the Twins beat the Athletics in Oakland for their third straight victory.</p>
        <p>Minnesota's Brian Buchanan had three hits in his second major league game. The Athletics lost their fifth in a row.</p>
        <p>Denny Hocking went 3 for 3 with a double. He is 9 for 13 in the first three games of the four-game series.</p>
        <p>Milton (3-1) struck out seven and walked two. Eddie Guardado finished with a perfect ninth for his second save.</p>
        <p>Mark Mulder (2-1) lost for the first time in seven career starts after allowing three runs -- one earned -- on seven hits in seven innings.</p>
        <p>WHITE SOX 6, BLUE JAYS 2: In Toronto, James Baldwin pitched a complete-game seven-hitter for his eighth straight victory.</p>
        <p>Craig Wilson went 3 for 4 with three runs scored and Frank Thomas was 3 for 3 for the White Sox, who have won five of their last six games.</p>
        <p>Baldwin (7-0), who won his final decision last season, is tied for the major league lead in victories. He has won 15 of his last 17 decisions.</p>
        <p>Shannon Stewart spoiled Baldwin's shutout bid with a homer in the eighth, and Carlos Delgado added another solo shot leading off the ninth.</p>
        <p>Toronto's David Wells, pitching on his 37th birthday, allowed six runs on 10 hits in three and one-third innings.</p>
        <p>RANGERS 2, ORIOLES 1: Esteban Loaiza pitched seven strong innings as host Texas beat Mike Mussina for its fifth straight victory.</p>
        <p>Chad Curtis hit a tie-breaking sacrifice fly in the sixth, and Loaiza (2-2) and the Texas bullpen made it stand up. The Rangers have won eight of their last 10 games. Baltimore has lost 14 of 16.</p>
        <p>John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his ninth save and 305th of his career, moving him past Jeff Montgomery into ninth place over all. Mussina (1-6) is off to the worst start of his career.</p>
