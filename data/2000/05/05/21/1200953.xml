        <p>Strange Fruit</p>
        <p>Billie Holiday, Cafe Society,</p>
        <p>and an Early Cry for Civil Rights.</p>
        <p>By David Margolick.</p>

        <p>NEITHER jazz nor blues nor ballad but a protest song in the form of a dirge, ''Strange Fruit'' occupies a category of one in American popular music. Born of the collaboration between a 36-year-old Jewish English teacher from De Witt Clinton High School in the Bronx and the singer Billie Holiday, the song was conceived at a moment in our cultural history in which a large number of artists and writers, like Orson Welles, Clifford Odets and Richard Wright, struggled to fuse their politics with their art. Some were members of the Communist Party; others traveled alongside it. Whether Abel Meeropol, who wrote the lyric for ''Strange Fruit'' (and would years later adopt the sons of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg), was or was not a card-carrying Communist is irrelevant. In his poems and songs, he gave voice to the left's campaigns against fascism and racial discrimination.</p>
        <p>As David Margolick writes in ''Strange Fruit: Billie Holiday, Cafe Society, and an Early Cry for Civil Rights,'' Meeropol published an anti-lynching poem in The New York Teacher, a union publication, in January 1937. He later set the poem to music. Over the next few years, ''Strange Fruit'' would be performed regularly at left-wing rallies by Meeropol's wife, members of the teachers' union and assorted soloists and ensembles. In early 1939, Meeropol took his song to Barney Josephson, the founder and owner of Cafe Society, the integrated Greenwich Village cabaret that had become a gathering place for left-wingers, intellectuals, artists, writers and jazz lovers.</p>
        <p>Josephson gave the song to Holiday, who, he later told a British documentary filmmaker, had no idea what it was about but sang it anyway. Despite Josephson's claim, Holiday, who had suffered from racism all her life, needed no help in understanding Meeropol's words. What she needed help with -- and Josephson provided it -- was finding a way to get audience members to look up from their drinks and stop chatting long enough to listen to a song about a lynching. To prepare his patrons for ''Strange Fruit,'' Margolick writes, Josephson ''decreed elaborate stage directions for each of the three nightly performances. Holiday was to close each set with it. Before she began, all service stopped. Waiters, cashiers, busboys were all immobilized. The room went completely dark, save for a pin spot on Holiday's face. When she was finished and the lights went out, she was to walk off the stage, and no matter how thunderous the ovation, she was never to return for a bow.''</p>
        <p>After Holiday's record company, Columbia, refused to record ''Strange Fruit'' because of the incendiary lyrics and because her producer, John Hammond, did not much like it, Holiday took the song to Milt Gabler, a politically engaged record producer who ran his own label, Commodore Records, out of a music store on East 42nd Street. The song was recorded in April and released that summer. The impact was immediate. Samuel Grafton, a reporter for The New York Post, devoted a column to the record, which, he confessed, ''has obsessed me for two days. . . . It will, even after the 10th hearing, make you blink and hold onto your chair.''</p>
        <p>Listening to Holiday's original recording, we understand why Grafton in 1939 and Margolick more than 60 years later were moved to write about the song and the singer. Meeropol's words as transmuted by Holiday's voice grab the listener by the throat. There is no escape, no release from the horror that builds phrase by phrase until by the second line of the second stanza -- the bulging eyes and the twisted mouth'' -- it becomes almost unbearable:</p>
        <p>Southern trees bear a strange fruit,</p>
        <p>Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,</p>
        <p>Black body swinging in the Southern breeze,</p>
        <p>Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.</p>
        <p>Pastoral scene of the gallant South,</p>
        <p>The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,</p>
        <p>Scent of magnolia sweet and fresh,</p>
        <p>And the sudden smell of burning flesh!</p>
        <p>''Strange Fruit'' is, first and last, a song about a lynching. Though the number of lynchings had declined from near 80 in 1919 to 24 in 1933 and 18 in 1935, the image of the ''black body swinging in the Southern breeze'' had been indelibly burned into the consciousness of black Americans. Lynching was the ultimate crime against humanity, a crime that in its unspeakable violence and its casual, at times almost celebratory disregard for law and order was, as Ida B. Wells had argued a half-century earlier, ''a disgrace to the civilization of the United States.'' Black activists and their supporters, led by the N.A.A.C.P., had been campaigning for a federal anti-lynching statute since 1919. Even without the support of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who refused to endorse the legislation because he feared antagonizing Southern Democrats, an anti-lynching bill had been passed by the House in 1935, only to be buried in the Senate. In 1940, one year after the release of ''Strange Fruit,'' another anti-lynching bill passed the House, but it too died in the Senate.</p>
        <p>Holiday had left Cafe Society by then, but wherever she traveled over the next two decades she took ''Strange Fruit'' with her. As she grew older, she performed the song a bit less often. ''She didn't like to sing it because it hurt her so much,'' Margolick quotes Lee Young, the drummer and brother of the saxophonist Lester Young, as saying. ''She would cry every time she would do it.''</p>
        <p>Holiday recorded ''Strange Fruit'' four times after the 1939 Commodore session, the last in a televised London concert in February 1959. She died that summer. Meeropol developed Alzheimer's disease in the late 1970's. He died of pneumonia in 1986.</p>
        <p>There is a tendency in contemporary cultural criticism to make the critic the star and to drown the artwork in a torrent of description, commentary and evaluation. Margolick, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, wisely cedes the spotlight to Holiday, Meeropol, the musicians who worked with them and those who heard the song. Like Holiday's performance, Margolick's book is understated but intense, suffused with grace, power and dignity. It works on several levels: as tribute, elegy, homage and cultural history.</p>
