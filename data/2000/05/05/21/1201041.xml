        <p>London and several other areas of Britain get new telephone area codes; London's 171 is now 207; list (S)</p>

        <p>Telephone numbers in London and some other parts of Britain have changed -- the third time in 10 years for London. The last time London numbers were changed the Office of Telecommunications said it expected no further changes, but it apparently did not foresee the demand for new numbers caused by the Internet, fax machines and the explosion in cell phone use.</p>
        <p>The area codes for London, Cardiff, Coventry, Portsmouth, Southampton and Northern Ireland have changed from 1 to 2. After dialing 44 (the country code for Britain), callers to these areas from the United States now dial 2 -- followed by local codes that have also been changed, as shown in the chart. The local code is followed by the old personal number (seven digits in London).</p>

        <p>Telephone numbers in London and some other parts of Britain have changed -- the third time in 10 years for London. The last time London numbers were changed the Office of Telecommunications said it expected no further changes, but it apparently did not foresee the demand for new numbers caused by the Internet, fax machines and the explosion in cell phone use.</p>
        <p>The area codes for London, Cardiff, Coventry, Portsmouth, Southampton and Northern Ireland have changed from 1 to 2. After dialing 44 (the country code for Britain), callers to these areas from the United States now dial 2 -- followed by local codes that have also been changed, as shown in the chart. The local code is followed by the old personal number (seven digits in London).</p>
        <p>In Northern Ireland the 28 is followed by one of more than 30 revised district codes.</p>
        <p>The new codes in the six areas are now in use, although the old codes will continue to work until later in the year. More information about code changes is available at www.numberchange.org.</p>
        <p>For example, when making a local call in London you prefix the existing number with a 7 (for a 207 number) or an 8 (for the 208 area). When not dialing locally but within Britain you need a zero before the 2.</p>
        <p>The numbers for all cell-phone, pager and personal numbers in Britain are also changing, but existing numbers will work until April 28, 2001. After that they will be prefixed by a 7.</p>
