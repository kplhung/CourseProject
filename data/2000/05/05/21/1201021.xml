        <p>GOING to the movies used to be no big deal for kids. Many of us would see films the way we read books: because it never occurred to us not to.

''This is where I came in'' still had meaning then, and often it wasn't until the movie ended and began again that you learned what the title was. My friends and I saw every single movie that was made for us, and many that weren't.

        <p>GOING to the movies used to be no big deal for kids. Many of us would see films the way we read books: because it never occurred to us not to. I remember walking, every Saturday, to the RKO or the Loew's on East 86th Street. There'd be a double bill, and no one was too particular about what was playing or what time it started. ''This is where I came in'' still had meaning then, and often it wasn't until the movie ended and began again that you learned what the title was. My friends and I saw every single movie that was made for us, and many that weren't. And later, we also occasionally sat upstairs in the balcony and necked and sneaked cigarettes, but that's another story. Or perhaps not.</p>
        <p>Nowadays -- in these much more salubrious, enlightened days of ratings and $5 popcorn and clean, no-smoking, no-talking theaters -- when people take their children to the movies, what do they want to get out of it? Perhaps it just happens to be the shape that an American family outing takes, especially when the weather isn't fabulous.</p>
        <p>Judging by the amount of complaining and the lack of specificity, it seems that many people know only what they don't want. They don't want to be left flat. They want to have fun with their kids. That's all, really, that people demand of the movies for their families: they want to be happy.</p>
        <p>''How was it? Was it violent? Was it scary?'' you'll hear one adult say to another. And they're talking about ''Stuart Little.'' Surely, there must be a correlation between the huge number of new books on parenting and the extraordinary concern about so-called family movies. Worried parents have taken to wandering in a maze of intricacies of what is and isn't appropriate -- appropriate language; appropriate amount of violence, sex, fear, diversity; appropriate amount of stimulation and lack thereof; appropriate amount of play of the imagination; appropriate amount of good and bad news about life.</p>
        <p>Well, then, parents of small and mid-size children had better strap themselves in. Getting ready to zoom, glide, slide, swat, trundle and chug-a-chug-a onto their neighborhood screens this summer is a particularly vexing collection of movies, buttressed by colossal ad campaigns, marketing deals, tie-ins, link-ups, crossover and franchising strategies. Why vexing? Because each is like a discrete galaxy. How do you tell, ahead of time, whether you're going to be happy outside the Milky Way?</p>
        <p>''Chicken Run'' (June 23), ''The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' (June 30), ''Pokemon the Movie 2000'' (July 21), ''Thomas and the Magic Railroad'' (July 26) -- and some of the more adventurous parents will want to add ''X-Men'' (July 14) -- are all big-budget, big-big-concept entertainment. A ''family'' film these days is not only 90 minutes in a theater, it's a design universe and a lifestyle. It trails in its wake not only the highly visible logos endlessly appliqued, stickered or hologrammed onto junk-food wrappers, mugs, T-shirts, pajamas, CD-ROM's, books, Game Boy cartridges, soundtracks, trading cards, Web sites and heaven knows what else, but also a language, an attitude, an ambience and a technological ideology.</p>
        <p>It was at a recent press presentation for ''Dinosaur'' (which opened on Friday) that I realized something new and really different was going on. In part, I was taken aback by the extraordinary effects: Disney's ''Dinosaur'' is a Herculean enterprise combining computer graphics and live action that took about a decade to assemble. An entire team of animators, we were told, worked solely on the fatty tissue problem, and a second team then layered on muscle bulges and jiggling flesh, effecting ''breakthroughs'' in portraying skin and musculature. Millions of dollars went to the problem of the fur of the lemurs who pal around with the dinosaurs. At one point, every lemur's coat contained 1,200,000 hairs, each with a serial number -- so that it could sway with the wind, for example, when the script called for it. All that fur hogged so much memory, however, that the computers slowed down too much and the process had to be set aside.</p>
        <p>B UT what really amazed me was when a journalist asked whether a ''single'' -- a ''Dinosaur'' theme song -- would be released at the same time as the movie, and the producer, Pam Marsden, answered ''No.''</p>
        <p>''Not even over the titles?'' insisted the journalist. The others laughed.</p>
        <p>''No,'' said Ms. Marsden. ''At least none is planned.''</p>
        <p>So there was no intention to hedge the bet here. Was there that much faith in the movie?</p>
        <p>Family pictures have completely changed in the last 10 years,'' said Brian Levant, the director of both Flintstone movies. ''The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,'' which opened April 28, was shot, with the help of some 4,500 extras, on the biggest set since Cecil B. DeMille's ''Ten Commandments''; it was built -- or, rather, Flintstonized -- from scratch. In preproduction for close to a year, it employed a crew of 1,000. ''You get to create the whole world,'' said Mr. Levant, ''a civilization. Those things that made 'The Wizard of Oz' such an incredible voyage visually we can do very easily now. So many films being made now tax the imagination of both the filmmaker and the audience. There are no stories that cannot be told.''</p>
        <p>There are no stories that can't be told. What does that mean for our children?</p>
        <p>In the good old days of straightforward dualities, there were two neatly opposing theories about storytelling for children. On the one hand, according to psychoanalysts, mythologists and literary types, children use tales to enlarge the span of their own imaginative play and also to learn to live with the dark side of themselves. On the other, according to the excessively sentimental and purple television star, Barney, ''I love you, you love me, we're a happy family.''</p>
        <p>While parents' concerns are understandable, any attempt to bring the problem back down to a nicely manageable pro or con sort of proposition is a Sisyphean task.</p>
        <p>For while some adults remain obsessed with issues of appropriate and inappropriate, or with the big bad evil marketing specialists, filmmakers and kids have gone on to embrace a much more complex, multilayered experience, of which the film is only one aspect.</p>
        <p>''We should have had a full education for the parents saying this is what the world is,'' says Norman Grossfeld, the American producer of the first Pokemon movie. ''We never warned them that the Pokemon only spoke their own names.'' Released theatrically last year and recently out in video, it consists of a 22-minute short and a 76-minute feature.</p>
        <p>''The adults barely watched the first movie,'' Mr. Grossfeld continued. ''It wasn't enjoyable to them because they were not prepared for a 20-minute movie without dialogue. And here we were thrilled because we got the characters to emote without speaking. So they didn't have an open mind when they got to the main feature, and it didn't get the attention that it deserved.''</p>
        <p>The kids, of course, all knew. They knew because they had fully inhabited the whole Pokemon world long before the movie came out. In the press, there was much talk at the time about the economics and the consumerism of it all. (And parents may well have resented the hit on their wallets.) But among kindergartners, the talk was of the Pokemon themselves -- their names (all 151), families, types, exotic powers and weaknesses and how some evolve. Unlike their adults, the kids going to see the Pokemon movie knew what the characters were capable of, whether they were good or bad guys and what their relationships were to the others.</p>
        <p>I remember being struck, watching the first movie, by a panorama of the Pokemon characters flying together looking -- of all things -- quite beautiful. Seeing them in formation like this I realized how reminiscent they were of characters from Greek mythology. Many adults remain fixated on the violence in Pokemon, but closer scrutiny would perhaps persuade them that conflict is amply accounted for by a clear system of morality in which integrity is rewarded, and honorable heroes are attractive to children (thereby fulfilling the time-honored terms of fairy tales, which may be essentially immoral, but which feature an alluring moral hero with whom the child will wish to identify).</p>
        <p>Undoubtedly, the Pokemon also spend a good deal of their energy and powers preparing for and engaging in some quite original (and not at all gory) battle, and they display a considerable amount of aggression -- perhaps as much, say, as your average kindergarten class at recess. But in addition, kids are certainly taken by the themes of quest, valor and honor, by the nurturing friendships between the trainers and their Pokemon. And of course part of what attracts kids is what confounds adults, which is that the whole thing is so byzantine. There are so many of them, so many alliances and back-stories and subplots to keep track of. No wonder children are mesmerized.</p>
        <p>In the new movie, the world is thrown out of balance when an eccentric collector captures the various birds of the Pokemon myth, each of which controls a separate part of the balance of the universe -- the bird of ice, the bird of fire, the bird of electricity. Ash, the Pokemon hero, has coincidentally been chosen to be king of a festival, and as the balance of the world becomes disturbed he is called upon to become the hero he represents in the festival.</p>
        <p>He teams up with a new Pokemon called Lugia, a big, serpenty, white-and-blue bird with psychic powers. Five other brand-new Pokemon will appear in the movie, trailblazers for the more than 100 silver and gold theme characters that will be released in the fall.</p>
        <p>''Kids can absorb so much more information and language than when they get older,'' says Mr. Grossfeld. ''We don't write down to them -- we have a healthy respect for what kids can handle. They're not being marketed to or at, they're being entertained.''</p>
        <p>The first Pokemon movie was never intended for export, and its animation is offbeat and somewhat dark by American standards. Mr. Grossfeld says the new movie will be brighter. ''The first movie had one story line,'' he says. ''This one has a subplot and more characters and many more stories converge at the end.''</p>
        <p>To my suggestion that the first movie had been underestimated, Mr. Grossfeld responded that it was perhaps too cerebral for most adults. ''What kind of a movie has a main character who has to figure out what his reason for being is?'' he asked, rather apologetically, and definitely rhetorically.</p>
        <p>O NE adult with no trouble grasping the need for these themes in children's lives is Britt Allcroft, the director of ''Thomas and the Magic Railroad'' -- a film many would see as the antithesis of ''Pokemon'' and the boat it came in on. ''Thomas'' is based on the tranquil character whose principal ambition is to be a very useful engine. The little blue wooden train is well known to boys and girls from the prize-winning television series ''Shining Time Station,'' which Ms. Allcroft created in Britain in the late 70's.</p>
        <p>As I told Ms. Allcroft -- who seemed the sort of person one could confide in -- my son, Luc, had been for a hefty portion of his total of nearly 6 years a passionate admirer of Thomas the Tank Engine: a singer of the Thomas the Tank Engine theme and the owner of a Thomas the Tank Engine railroad set, of Thomas memorabilia, videocassettes and pajamas. Indeed, in his closet now there are still boxes containing Thomas the Tank Engine trains, tunnels, bridges, underpasses, roundhouses and clickety-clack tracks, all of which he refused to surrender.</p>
        <p>But he'd moved on in his viewing interests. I thought he never would, but he did -- to Fred Astaire musicals and Billy Wilder comedies like ''Some Like It Hot'' and Jacques Tati farces like ''Playtime'' and adventure movies like ''The Swiss Family Robinson'' and also, of course, to every sort of superhero movie -- be it trashy or transcendent.</p>
        <p>And why shouldn't he? My hope is that he will be able to use them all to activate different locales in his fantasy life. Sometimes, he might want to hark back to the serene days of tooling about the British countryside with Thomas, the really useful engine. On other, more active days, he might want to be fuming with the rather ill-tempered Gengar or Mewtwo (or whatever his current favorites are among the Pokemon), or feeling helpless and adorable with Stuart Little, or scowling along with Batman or Superman (or Wonder Woman? Where is she, producers of America?).</p>
        <p>''I'd like my son to be able to watch both 'Thomas' and 'Pokemon,' '' I told Ms. Allcroft.</p>
        <p>''Exactly!'' she said. ''Why shouldn't young children enjoy both? On my shelves, I've got 'Auntie Mame' there and here I've got 'Memories, Dreams and Reflections' and over here I've got 'Greatest Mountain Journeys in the World.' If he kind of tucks the Thomas times of his life away and then he comes back to them, I would be very happy.</p>
        <p>''The core viewers of Thomas start at about 18 months and go up to about 7 or 8, but they enjoy these stories at different levels,'' Ms. Allcroft continued. ''And what I think is very important to the longevity of those stories is that they're stories the grownups can enjoy along with the children.''</p>
        <p>''Thomas and the Magic Railroad'' actually features grown-up actors -- and they're not just voice-overs. In the movie, the 11-year-old Lily (Mara Wilson) takes the wrong train on a visit to see her grandfather (Peter Fonda), a once happy railway engineer who now lives a solitary life. She ends up in the scenic town of Shining Time, where she meets the magical Mr. Conductor (Alec Baldwin), who of course takes her on an adventure to the Island of Sodor, a toy world where Thomas, the tiny blue steam engine, lives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baldwin, who succeeded Ringo Starr and George Carlin as the narrator of the television show, got on board the Thomas bandwagon in part because Thomas is a favorite of his daughter's. Similarly, ''Thomas and the Magic Railroad'' is produced and distributed by Destination Films, which is headed by Barry London -- who worked for years to acquire the rights because he, too, had a little girl who loved Thomas.</p>
        <p>And that seems to be what it's about, really, all the fuss. It's very moving and more than a little disturbing to watch your child fall in love with a character other than yourself. Like their first blankies, these ''transitional objects'' accompany children to worlds that are not of our own making. Real or imaginary, they are the places where our children play and dream.</p>
        <p>But this is not what people talk about when they talk about kids' films. Should we or shouldn't we let our kids see ''The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps''? This is the sort of decision about which contemporary parents seem to think they need to develop a tough moral framework. ''I would rather have my kids laugh at humor about flatulence,'' I heard someone say recently (though she used a much less fancy word), ''than watch gratuitous violence. Of course, you have to explain this is something that happens in a movie, not something that's appropriate in real life.''</p>
        <p>Of course. And while plenty of parents would think nothing of taking a child to an Eddie Murphy movie, others would have them arrested. This time around, the decision was taken out of our hands by the film's PG-13 rating, but many people give up going to the movies once they have children, and among them there are further subdivisions about what to watch on tape. Books, magazines and Web sites now rate films, breaking them down for each age group and grading them by category, according to how they depict not just sex and violence, but also drinking and drug use, profanity, scatology.</p>
        <p>Among parents, the sole comfortable and unanimous point of agreement is on the subject of gratuitous violence. (Against!) But alas, this is not all that useful, since it is difficult to find any in a big-budget film that bills itself as a family picture.</p>
        <p>In the end, none of this arguing addresses the only real question, which is this: Now that we really understand how vulnerable children are, how do we best protect them? By showing them the world or by shielding them from it? It seems logical to conclude that there is no one answer, only a balance.</p>
        <p>Of course, there are movies in which technology takes over, in which violence seems to spring out of nowhere, everywhere, as if an anonymous, mechanistic, amorally vengeful environment will confound and ridicule man, robbing him of dignity and volition. I am thinking, for example, of Charlie Chaplin's ''Modern Times,'' which Luc and I have now watched several times, finding it funnier on each occasion.</p>
        <p>Perhaps we displace onto movies our feelings of powerlessness about so much else -- our children's schools, friends, choices, the frighteningly complex and confusing society in which they must navigate and the even less controllable future. But it's too bad to set up such a simplistic yes-no argument here, when something so much more profound and resonant is at stake.</p>
