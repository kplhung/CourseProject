        <p>Paul Solenick letter on Harvey Araton's May 16 article on Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight disagres with pass most Times sportswriters have given New York Knicks' Latrell Sprewell; photo</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Harvey Araton bemoans the foolish and violent behavior by Knight, and mostly I agree. Where I disagree most is the pass most Times sportswriters seem to have given Latrell Sprewell, now that he has ''reformed'' himself and is an integral part of the Knicks team. If Sprewell can get away with actually choking his coach, threatening to kill him, yet still be hired for millions of dollars by the Knicks after a short suspension, why should Knight's actions be cause for firing? Are not death threats and sustained choking episode at least as bad as a coach who verbally and physically intimidates those around him?</p>
        <p>You reap what you sow, especially in sports. Violence on the sidelines and in games escalates because young people see their role models (Sprewell) and coaches (Knight) getting away with it while suffering nothing more than a slap on the wrist. Sprewell lost a few million. Knight is a suspended for few games, and receives a token fine.</p>

        <p>Yet the underlying behavior is never firmly punished by permanent banishment from the sport. If sports heroes and coaches were really punished for their actions, maybe our young athletes (and young people in general) would get the message that their actions will result in real, lasting consequences. Oh, I forgot, the President also lied under oath. He wasn't punished either, was he?</p>
