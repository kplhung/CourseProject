        <p>WHEN I ordered 13 heirloom roses last fall, I vowed that I would prepare the rose beds before winter, working in plenty of compost and some aged manure to give those shrubs and climbers a good start.</p>
        <p>Did I accomplish this noble goal? Of course not.</p>
        <p>My roses arrived two weeks ago, 13 slender little plants with fragile leaves, sticking out of long tubular plastic pots. So I stuck them in the vegetable garden, which has a nice, crumbly feel after 15 years of compost and plenty of earthworms.</p>
        <p>Then I decided to study what is really going on beneath the surface. If I could picture all those transactions between bacteria and fungi, protozoa, nematodes, micro-arthropods -- the interactions called the soil food web -- I might work more on feeding my soil. A friend told me about a good Web site, www .soilfoodweb.com, which explains the basic biology in articles and links to other sites while providing images of the key players in this process.</p>
        <p>Plant vigor, I'm learning, depends upon mycorrhizae (a Latin word meaning fungus roots) and refers to the symbiotic associations between fungi that colonize inside and outside of feeder roots.</p>
        <p>It's that old you-scratch-my-back-and-I'll-scratch-yours. In healthy soil, a naturally occurring fungi called vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM, for short), colonize the cells of a plant's feeder roots. In exchange for carbohydrates made by the plant during photosynthesis, these fungi bring phosphorus, other minerals and water to the root. They also protect the roots from root-rot fungi and parasitic nematodes.</p>
        <p>''The plant is like the feudal warlord,'' said Dr. Elaine Ingham, a soil scientist at Oregon State University and the brains behind the Web site. ''It puts out the protein and carbohydrates to feed all the warriors to protect it against all those bad guys out there.''</p>
        <p>Bacteria, as well as fungi, swarm around those plant roots, slurping up the sugars. The bacteria, which are high in protein, are a feast for protozoa and beneficial nematodes. They convert the protein into nitrogen, which can then be used by plants.</p>
        <p>Bacteria and fungi also break down woody tissues, stems, leaves and dead roots, turning them into nutrients for somebody in the soil.</p>
        <p>Which is why good gardening comes down to compost, compost, compost.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ingham runs a company called Soil Foodweb Inc., which analyzes soil and diseases for growers and helps wean them from chemical agriculture. Like many microbiologists, she uses the expression food web, rather than food chain, because the biochemical interactions are not one continuous chain. A fine-tuned food web doesn't need fertilizer, or even lime. Acidic soil usually occurs when the soil is compacted and anaerobic.</p>
        <p>''If you add fertilizer to the soil, the plant will take up a tiny bit of it, but if you don't have a lot of bacteria and fungi to take up the rest, it will leach right out of the soil,'' Dr. Ingham said. And who needs it, if you have a food web making everything from soup to nuts.</p>
        <p>And another thing, she said. Don't rototill if you want good soil.</p>
        <p>Good, crumbly soil is made out of aggregates of sand, silt and clay particles held together by the gums and gels formed by bacteria. Fungi, root hairs and roots bind these aggregates, and the arthropods, insects and earthworms build the tiny rooms that let air and water trickle through.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ingham paints a picture of what the grasslands in the central valleys of California were like before the Europeans first came with their plows in the mid-1800's.</p>
        <p>''The soil was so rich, they could put seeds in and walk away,'' said Dr. Ingham, who has pored over the journals of those early farmers. There were no insect problems or diseases. Manure or compost was unnecessary, because the symbiosis taking place in the soil gave the plants everything they needed.</p>
        <p>The glory days lasted for more than a decade, before destructive fungal disease and insect infestations became a problem. ''By plowing and not adding residues back in, they were destroying the food web, which wasn't holding on to nutrients or maintaining disease suppression,'' Dr. Ingham said.</p>
        <p>By the post-World War II years, verticillium wilt, a fungal disease that attacks everything from strawberries to string beans, was threatening crop productivity. And though farmers used stronger and stronger chemicals, the fungi just developed stronger resistance. And now, methyl bromide, ''which basically sterilizes everything,'' Dr. Ingham said, is used before every planting of strawberries and other crops in commercial fields.</p>
        <p>''It's every bit as toxic as arsenic,''  said Dr. Ingham, who has been working with strawberry growers in San Luis Obispo, north of Los Angeles, to switch to more organic methods. ''But methyl bromide doesn't kill the root-feeding nematodes that can go down eight feet.'' It doesn't kill pathogens, either, she said, which can go dormant and germinate later from spores.</p>
        <p>And since there are no beneficial organisms left in this soil, it's essentially dead. Chemical fertilizers must be added for those strawberries to grow, and there is nothing to keep the nitrates from leaching into the water table.</p>
        <p>These soils have ''less than a half a percent of organic matter,'' Dr. Ingham said. A hundred years ago, they had 8 to 14 percent. What do we have left? Sand, that's about it.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ingham basically uses compost to rebuild these degraded soils. To help growers envision what to aim for, she measured life teeming in soil taken from a protected area in the Santa Maria Valley, near San Luis Obispo. In a single teaspoon of soil she found 600 million bacteria; ''a couple of miles of fungal hyfea,''  she said, referring to their microscopic threads; 10,000 protozoa; 30 beneficial nematodes; and too many other organisms to recount here.</p>
        <p>So don't throw that banana peel in the trash. Put it in your compost pile. Your roses, and everything else, will thank you.</p>
