        <p>What would a week in New York be without at least one jolting development in the race for United States Senate? So it was that on Friday, four days after Hillary Rodham Clinton was formally designated as the Democratic candidate at her party's convention in Albany, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani quit the race at a packed-to-the-rafters news conference.</p>

        <p>Mr. Giuliani said he needed to devote all his energy to deciding on a course of treatment and running the city. The Republican Party quickly turned to the future: at week's end,the most likely replacement for Mr. Giuliani was Rep. Rick A. Lazio, a Long Island Republican.</p>
