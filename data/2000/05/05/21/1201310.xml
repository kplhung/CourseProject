        <p>Investors are uncertain whether Federal Reserve will continue its campaign of interest-rate hikes following last week's half-a-percentage point increase, Fed's sixth rate hike since June 1999; Fed has indicated that it still regards inflation as a risk because economy continues to grow steadily (M)</p>

        <p>Wall Street just couldn't shake its interest-rate jitters last week, even though the Federal Reserve did what many had expected when it raised interest rates for the sixth time since last June.</p>
        <p>Investors are uncertain about whether the Fed will continue to increase rates and about the impact tighter credit might have on corporate earnings and stock prices. In raising short-term rates half a percentage point, the Fed indicated that inflation was still a risk because the economy continues to grow steadily.</p>
        <p>Investors are concerned about how high interest rates are going, said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist for A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons. Is there some level where interest rates could derail the economic recovery?</p>
        <p>Such worries, Mr. Goldman said, slowed trading activity, which accentuated the market's volatility.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index ended the week at 3,390.40, down about 4 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average closed slightly higher, at 10,626.85, up 17.48 points.</p>
        <p>Financial stocks, which are vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations, were among the losers, including Merrill Lynch.</p>
