        <p>You know it's really summer that first hot day you slip your feet into shoes without socks, stroll barefoot in the wet morning grass or wriggle your toes in the sand.</p>
        <p>Being able to kick off your shoes may well be the best bonus of the season, no matter what summer real estate lies underfoot. In a playpen, in the park, across the dunes and in the surf, the sweetest steps of summer are often those taken with unfettered toes.</p>

        <p>You know it's really summer that first hot day you slip your feet into shoes without socks, stroll barefoot in the wet morning grass or wriggle your toes in the sand.</p>
        <p>Being able to kick off your shoes may well be the best bonus of the season, no matter what summer real estate lies underfoot. In a playpen, in the park, across the dunes and in the surf, the sweetest steps of summer are often those taken with unfettered toes.</p>
        <p>''Footloose and fancy free,'' said Laurie Segal, a psychotherapist, child development expert and the executive director of FACE IT Inc. in Williston Park, a psychological wellness program. ''It's practically in our dialogue. It's about being free. It feels good. Little kids hate wearing shoes. They don't like the effort of putting them on. The idea of summer being footloose is just a part of the attitude of this free-spirited time of year. No books, no things to burden you.</p>
        <p>''That whole image of running through sprinklers as kids without our shoes is something we all recall from our youth.''  The freedom of walking barefoot is a pleasure that many people enjoy, said Lance Greiff, a podiatrist from Great Neck. ''Patients who feel claustrophobic in shoes complain of the pain, burning and itching that conventional shoe gear can cause. Bunions, hammertoes, certain heel spurs and foot and ankle swelling can make it difficult to fit shoes comfortably. They prefer the natural, unconfined, unrestricted mobility that barefoot walking allows.''</p>
        <p>But sole freedom does not always come easily. Stood on too long, almost always in motion, encased in socks and stuck in workaday shoes or stiletto heels, feet need to be pampered, pedicured and primed before being exposed for summer.</p>
        <p>Some feet facts: Each foot contains 26 bones, 33 joints, 107 ligaments and 19 muscles held together by tendons that allow it to move in various ways. The 52 bones in your feet make up about one quarter of all the bones in your body. The average person takes 8,000 to 10,000 steps a day. In a lifetime, that adds up to 115,000 miles, four times the circumference of the Earth.</p>
        <p>No wonder they ache.</p>
        <p>Pampered Feet</p>
        <p>The path to buttery soft soles begins with a cup of hot green tea and an assortment of polished and heated river stones placed on the belly, under the hands and beneath the neck. ''Even if you are having reflexology, this will loosen up the tension in your neck,'' said Annemarie Wright, a massage therapist at the Greenhouse Spa in Manhasset, explaining that heat is associated with relaxation.</p>
        <p>She started a recent half-hour session, dubbed Foot Attention, by lifting the hot, tumbled stones from a portable oven filled with water and placing them on a supine client, then wrapping her in a cocoon of blankets, leaving only her bare feet dangling. ''When you relax the feet, the whole body relaxes,'' Ms. Wright said. ''Think about it. When you are walking around, all the stress and the tension is on your feet. When you lie down at night and put up your feet, automatically that takes a lot of tension off your body.''</p>
        <p>Though it was early in the morning, the dim lighting in the room and the two flickering candles and soft background music helped start the relaxation process.</p>
        <p>Then Ms. Wright began rotating and loosening her client's ankles, creating a pulling sensation that extended all the way to the hip socket. According to the ancient Chinese art of reflexology, the foot mirrors the entire body, with each organ corresponding to a part of the lowest extremity. The big toe represents the head and neck, Ms. Wright said, and the top of it is the pituitary gland. Massaging it would help with brain function or at least stimulate energy flow, she said. Keep rubbing, the reporter urged.</p>
        <p>''For some people it helps, but I think it depends on your state of mind,'' Ms. Wright said, finger walking the sole, working from heel to toe and back again, easily inducing a sense of deep calm even if connections to lower back pain seemed more dubious.</p>
        <p>Many clients -- lots of stay-at-home-moms -- fall asleep and spend the half-hour session snoring. Easy to fathom, but a shame. Not to be missed: the sublime feeling of warm, tumbled stones between the toes to finish off. Mmmmm.</p>
        <p>Foot Attention, Greenhouse Spa, Northern Boulevard, Manhasset., (516) 869-0100: $50.</p>
        <p>Toe Polish</p>
        <p>They call her the Nail Doctor.</p>
        <p>Patricia Sherin of Bethpage has been pampering tired, aching feet with professional pedicures for 44 years. She does for nails what a dental hygienist can do for teeth. She remembers when Revlon only had two colors -- Lipstick Red and Pretty Pink -- back when 75-cent manicures and pedicures were given while the ladies were at the beauty parlor, under the hair dryer.</p>
        <p>These days, Ms. Sherin gives over-the-top pedicures in one of the 14 private treatment rooms at the Greenhouse Spa in Manhasset. Her clients -- 35 percent of whom are men -- dress in navy spa robes, lean back against piles of pillows and soak their feet in baths of mineral water and salts. The nail polish, chosen from a tray laden with dozens of shades of red (dull polish or a buff for the guys), is almost an afterthought.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sherin's 45-minute to hour-long pedicures range from a soothing gel procedure that includes a masque and alpha hydroxy lotion to slough dead skin cells off the leg, plus a shin and foot massage ($55), to the ultimate Seascape Pedicure ($55). That includes slathering the feet in self-heating Dead Sea Mud, wrapping them in a lightweight tin foil like baked potatoes, then sliding them into cellophane bags to detoxify for 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>With a Parafango Pedicure ($40), she anoints legs with a blue-tinted oil, then dips gauze into hot wax and wraps each foot like a cast. Afterward, Ms. Sherin applies green-apple kiwi moisturizer, made with avocado oil, to further soften, smooth and relax the feet. For cracked, creased soles, she recommended five-minute oxygen treatments. Laser pedicures that remove age spots, exfoliate and soften the feet are also available ($200).</p>
        <p>As a pedicure maven, Ms. Sherin can tell how her clients walk, what kind of shoes they wear, which foot they put forward first, who has fungus and who suffers from psoriasis. She knows who tiptoes barefoot and whose toes are rarely exposed.</p>
        <p>''I like the end result, when you can make somebody happy and forget and relax for an hour,'' she said. ''The whole secret is the idea of the human touch. It's very healing.  When you look down, I just feel it makes you happy. Your feet feel better, you feel better. Your feet are your second heart. All your nerve endings are centered in your feet and your hands.''</p>
        <p>Sparkling Ankles</p>
        <p>Diamonds for your fingers. Diamonds for your earlobes. But diamonds for your feet?</p>
        <p>''Why not? It's adornment,'' said Vivian Landis, a saleswoman at London Jewelers in Wheatley Plaza in Greenvale. ''It's body art.''</p>
        <p>For the past few summers, diamond bracelets have been sparkling on ankles, not just wrists. Especially fashionable for the bare-legged, Ms. Landis said, are an 18-karat white gold antique reproduction with two carats of tiny diamonds set in oval and fleur-de-lis links at $3,000; a flower link bracelet with a pink sapphire centers, $2,295 and a more delicate white gold rolo-link chain studded with tiny rose gold and pave diamond moons, hearts and a star charm, for $595.</p>
        <p>Ankle bracelets are versatile. Wear them with slip-on mules and a summer dress for dinner in the Hamptons, casually with capris or with nothing more than a bikini beside the pool. At 8 1/2 to 9 inches, the anklets are longer than the standard 7-inch wrist bracelet, allowing for flexibility while walking through sand. ''It's very feminine,'' Ms. Landis said. ''It's a fashion accessory people like to wear in the summertime.''</p>
        <p>Summer Shoes</p>
        <p>Fur isn't usually associated with warm weather. But hey, the animals wear it year-round, don't they? Besides, these zebra, cow and leopard skins are synthetic. Mounted across the vamp on leather sandals, in casual wedge, flat mule and block-heeled styles, all with open toe fronts, faux skin makes feet look -- if not feel -- like they are on safari. Zebra-skin slip on wedge, $59, Nine West, Northern Boulevard, Manhasset.</p>
        <p>Laces are out. Slipping feet in and out of summer sneakers is in. The Air Kukini ($89.99) by Nike, a laceless running sneaker that made its debut in April, is made of a stretchy blue Lycra that conforms itself to the shape of the foot and resembles the reflection of water in a swimming pool. Topped with plastic webbing, the sneakers may look waterproof, but they're not. $89.99, for men and women, Athlete's Foot, Wheatley Plaza, Greenvale.</p>
        <p>Remember when your feet were so wet and sticky coming off the beach that you just crushed down the heel of your sneakers and clomped around with just the front of your foot stuck inside? Not anymore. This summer, the backs were intentionally left off. Meant for just hanging around, the Adidas' Superstar clog, one of several varieties of slip-on sneakers, provides an alternative to sandals. $49.99. Athlete's Foot, Wheatley Plaza.</p>
        <p>They only look like party shoes. Little girls can walk across wet grass, play in the sprinkler, or dance in the surf in a pair of glittery plastic jellies without messing up their Mary Janes. The newest waterproof slippers, shaped more like shoes than sandals, are fancier than their originally utilitarian prototypes, said Judi Brower, owner of Feet First, a shoe store in Oceanside. ''It would be perfect at the beach and it's very fashionable,'' said Ms. Brower. ''People buy them as dress-up shoes.'' Clear or pink with glitter inside the plastic, the jellies can also be used by campers in the shower. Grenda Kids Mary Jane closed-toe jelly with strap and teardrop cutouts, $17; iridescent pink jelly with a double strap, open toe and platform sole, $29. Feet First, 3161 Long Beach Road, Oceanside. 516-536-3372.</p>
        <p>Toe Rings</p>
        <p>There's no rule that says which toe a toe ring goes on. Open in the back and adjustable, they usually fit all but the biggest toe. So why not wiggle them on all four little piggies? ''It's jewelry for the foot,'' said Esther Levine, owner of Esther's Place, a discount designer costume jewelry and accessories booth inside the Turnbury Lady/ Faces and Fragrances boutique in Oceanside. She noted that the seasonal popularity of capris and flood pants exposes ankles and toes. ''It's a fashion statement.''</p>
        <p>Made of sterling, the rings won't tarnish in the water. This summer's styles include a dainty belt buckle, a daisy on a petal, a whale floating on an open weave and a slim double-band of flowers. ''It's just another beautiful accent for summer. The foot should be dressed up, too,'' Ms. Levine said. $7 each. Esther's Place at Turnbury Lady, 3442 Long Beach Road, Oceanside. (516) 764-3193.</p>
        <p>Pampering Tootsies Yourself</p>
        <p>Priming feet for summertime exposure at home is easy; there are dozens of do-it-yourself products on the market.</p>
        <p>At Bed, Bath and Beyond, the Earth Therapeutics Feet First Pedicure Kit ($19.99) comes with natural treatments that are antiseptic and antifungal, including a tube of Tea Tree Oil foot peel and a bottle of Tea Tree Oil spray. The relax foot massager, a roller that resembles a curved abacus with three rows of rotating wood discs, helps soothe away cramps and aches; the loofah foot sponge washes away impurities; a four-sided filing block helps put the finishing touches on a pedicure.</p>
        <p>The entire insole on Homedic's TheraP magnetic slippers ($29.99) is a magnet. Place feet in the cushioned foam open-toe slippers, Velcro the band to fit and magnetic waves penetrate the feet, supposedly increasing blood flow and oxygen exchange.  Hence, less pain. Homedics also makes the Therapist Select Professional Reflexology Foot Tapper ($49.99). This boasts five massage styles, an infared sensor that responds to foot pressure and a foam carrying handle.</p>
        <p>Moisturizing foot socks ($5.99) come with a small packet of Tea Tree Oil foot repair balm for dry, rough, callused feet. Put the lotion on first and keep the therapeutic socks on overnight to help absorb the oil.</p>
        <p>Greenhouse Spa sells the green apple-kiwi foot soak ($15), a 10-ounce plastic jar filled with aromatic Dead Sea salts to moisturize, sooth and soften used in its 14 private treatment rooms. The spa's tube of jelly-looking Foot Buff ($9.75) also contains moisturizers.  The Sole Soother ($22) contains glycolic acid to smoothe and exfoliate, soothing aloe vera, peppermint to cool and aromatic eucalyptus as a cleansing antiseptic. Greenhouse's Foot Moisturizer is $9.75.</p>
        <p>On the foot shelves at Genovese, Johnson's Foot Soap ($2.54) contains a combination of borax, bran and iodide. Mix it with two quarts of hot water and soak feet to soften corns and calluses and to soothe aching feet. Among the myriad Dr. Scholl's products is the dual action nail brush ($4.79); one side has angled bristles to clean under nails, the other side holds a natural pumice stone. Wet the stone with warm water and rub over hard skin to remove thick calluses.</p>
        <p>The Iced Blueberry and Balm Mint anti-stress deodorizing foot cooler (99 cents) comes in a one-use packet shaped like a pair of feet. Massage the cream foot talc over the entire foot, especially between the toes, and the lotion becomes a soft, silky powder. Don't bother to rinse. The talc contains corn flour, blueberry extract and peppermint oil.</p>
        <p>Ahhh.</p>
