        <p>FROM July to October, if you want to tout your prize tomatoes or brag about your baking skills, promote your photography or show off your string beans, there is an agricultural fair somewhere in Connecticut where you can do it.</p>
        <p>Agricultural fairs started as a day off, a time at harvest when farmers could socialize with their peers, when their children could enter their prize animals in competition and quilters could compare their handiwork. Though agriculture represents a shrinking sector of the economy, the tradition continues.</p>
        <p>''People are still growing things out in their yards, and they still want to find out how they did compared to everyone else,'' said Raymond Schaer, president of the Cannon Grange Agricultural Fair, which is held on the last Sunday of August every year in Wilton. ''It's a fascination with the basic life style, sort of back to the earth. I think sometimes, for some people, on a Sunday, it's a nice way to go back to a simpler time.''</p>
        <p>The fairs range from gatherings of a few thousand people in a single day in Orange to crowds approaching a quarter-million over long weekends in Durham and Woodstock. Prize money could be as little as $200 at the smaller fairs to $80,000 or more at the state-level events.</p>
        <p>Every fair has the standards: produce competition, livestock judging, probably a beauty pageant, square dancing and a tractor pull. But many develop their own specialty. It might be a flea market at one, a horse show at another, or a pie-eating or nail-driving contest, perhaps an egg toss. There are usually picnic areas, and live entertainment of some sort, ranging from local magic acts to national headliners at the Durham Fair, which in the past has offered country singers such as Billy Ray Cyrus, Patty Loveless, Loretta Lynn and Boxcar Willy, and the rock artists .38 Special and Three Dog Night.</p>
        <p>And it can be had pretty cheap in most cases, from free admission to a high of about $5 for adults; most fairs admit children free. This year the fairs run from July 13, when the North Stonington Agricultural Fair opens, until Oct. 15, when the Riverton Fair closes.</p>
        <p>Paul R. Schweitzer is president of the Harwinton Fair, the last major fair, always the first weekend in October, this year Oct. 7 and 8. ''About 12 years ago, we got snowed out on Sunday,'' he said. ''We literally had to shut the fair down. Then other years, we've had temperatures in the 80's.''</p>
        <p>James M. Zeoli, president of the Orange Country Fair, Sept. 16 and 17, said the men generally head for the doodle bug pulls -- a doodle bug is sort of a homemade contraption on the chassis of a heavy truck -- while the women are partial to the antique dealers and arts and crafts, and the children check out the police and fire department booths and the animal exhibits.</p>
        <p>''It's more chickens and rabbits than larger animals, but we usually get a couple of dozen cows, some goats, and maybe a sow with piglets,'' Mr. Zeoli said. ''Sometimes we set up an incubator with chicken eggs, and when word gets around that a hatch is in progress, the kids gather around. Years ago, you took for granted that everyone had seen a chicken hatch, because everyone kept them. But it's not something most people have an opportunity to see today.''</p>
        <p>One way to keep people coming back, Mr. Zeoli said, is to offer something new. This year for the first time the Orange Country Fair will bring in the Old Time Indian River Lumberjack Show, which features sawing and chopping competitions and a log-rolling contest.</p>
        <p>For a first-timer, a fair could easily produce sensory overload: the one-lunger engines chugging away to power a shingle mill, the bellowing of a tractor pulling a huge concrete block, the cackle of chickens or the grunting of pigs. Then there are the smells from the food booths: fried dough, sausage and pepper grinders, five-alarm chili or clam chowder or deep-fried onions and potatoes. And, from the animal barns, the earthy scents of cattle and horses, sheep and goats, chickens and rabbits, perhaps even a llama or two these days.</p>
        <p>''Those are sounds you don't hear anymore, scents that are no longer familiar,'' said Charles J. McCullough, president of the Norfield Grange Fair in Weston, held each year the first Sunday after Labor Day.</p>
        <p>His is a small fair, attracting 3,000 to 3,500 people. Others are much larger, such as the Woodstock Fair, which drew more than 216,000 people over the Friday-to-Monday Labor Day weekend last year, and would have topped 250,000 if it had not been for rain the last day, said Annette M. Hamilton. This year, Mrs. Hamilton finishes her fourth and last year as president. She is the first woman elected to the job in the 137-year history of the fair.</p>
        <p>Until a few years ago, vendors pitching kitchen aides and encyclopedias filled the main exhibition hall at Woodstock, but they were relegated to a smaller building when some thought the fair was becoming too commercial. Now,the vegetables, flowers, photography and crafts take center stage.  ''You need your vendors because that's what pays your bills and allows you to open the doors,'' Mrs. Hamilton said. ''But you can't let them overrun the fair. Our main goal is that people get the culture of agriculture, that they get the feel for what it is to be a farmer.''</p>
        <p>With fewer farmers in the state, some fairs are finding it more difficult to fill the exhibition halls, she said. ''We're drawing from Rhode Island and Massachusetts and New Hampshire and even Maine,'' Mrs. Hamilton said. ''It's not just Connecticut farmers anymore..''</p>
        <p>Planning goes on year-round, she said, with monthly meetings increasing to once a week as fair weekend draws near. She estimated that there are 200 volunteers with the fair association, and another 1,800 who show up to staff booths for the Lions, Elks, volunteer fire departments and other community groups. Even with all that labor, though, the fair has had to hire a year-round general manager, concession manager, secretary and assistant manager.</p>
        <p>''It never ends,'' said Mrs. Hamilton. ''We have all of the things set up for this year already, and we're already planning for 2001.''</p>
        <p>Even the fair officers are elected in a succession from second vice president, to first vice president, to president, holding each of the jobs for four years; when a new president takes office, the succession is pretty much assured for the next 12 years.  But it's getting harder to put on the fairs, because most of the active members are getting old, and there are no young people coming in behind them.</p>
        <p>''At our meeting last night I told the members we were going to have a site on the Internet, and you'd have thought I was talking about Star Wars,'' said Mr. McCullough of the Norfield Grange Fair. ''The average age of the members is probably well into their 60's, and we've got some into their 80's. If we're going to survive, we've got to get young people involved.''</p>
        <p>John H. Hauser, president of the Greenfield Grange Fair in Fairfield, agreed. He said when he joined the Grange 14 years ago, there were 12 Granges in the county; today, it has dwindled to 6. Generally, fewer than 20 people are at the monthly meetings, down from about 40 when he started. When he was growing up in the 1950's there were 150 active members.</p>
        <p>''They keep losing membership because young people just aren't joining, and when they don't have enough they just close the doors and turn their charters back to the state,'' Mr. Hauser said. ''We're hanging in there, but just barely. If the Grange goes belly up, most of the agricultural fairs will go with it.''</p>
