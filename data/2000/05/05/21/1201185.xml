        <p>To the Editor: The article about funerals and caskets (''Big Box Stores, Redefined,'' April 30) was informative. Four years ago, a friend in her 80's called on the services of a funeral director somewhere in Ocean County when her husband died. The cost was about $4,000 without the plot.  One year later, after a long illness, her son also died. She had the same funeral director. She lamented the fact that for exactly the same funeral, one year later, the cost had almost doubled. When she complained, the funeral director said this was not exactly the same funeral -- this time the casket was hand-rubbed.</p>
