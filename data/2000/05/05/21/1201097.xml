        <p>WAY back when, warm weather months meant a period of battery-recharging for most musicians, some breathing space before the pressures of the regular season.</p>
        <p>No longer. Things do slack off a bit in May, as concert stragglers complete their springtime schedules, but muscially once again it's full speed ahead in June.</p>
        <p>The most ambitious of these undertakings in Connecticut is the International Festival of Arts and Ideas, which will bring 2,000 performers to New Haven, Stamford and New London from June 16 through July 1.</p>
        <p>There's a lot more than music, and a lot more than art, for that matter, noted the festival director, Paul Collard, who said the programs would include ''a range of debates and discussion on important global topics.''</p>
        <p>Among the musical events of note is the D'Oyly Carte Company's first American visit in nearly 20 years; it will be staging ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' June 16 to June 18 at the Shubert in New Haven. There will also be an outdoor concert by the Metropolitan Opera Company: ''Madama Butterfly'' will be presented at 8 p.m. on June 30 on the New Haven Green.  Julius Rudel will conduct the Hungarian soprano Georgina Lukacs in the title role, with Paul Charles Clarke as Pinkerton.</p>
        <p>In fact, the New Haven Green will be alive with the sounds of music throughout the festival weeks: concerts are scheduled at 12:30 and 5:30 p.m. from June 19 through June 23  and again from June 26 through June 30. All these concerts are free, though others are ticketed.</p>
        <p>The number to call for information and tickets is (888) ART-IDEA.</p>
        <p>Two other orchestral offerings place themselves at the mercy of the elements. ''We've had our share of rain interruptions,'' said John Eells, music director of the Farmington Valley Symphony, ''but at least our programs are on the lawn of Miss Porter's School, so we can scurry inside if need be.'' Mr. Eels has chosen Satie's ''Parade'' and Ravel's ''Bolero'' for the 6:30 p.m. concert on June 17 (860-651-9962).</p>
        <p>Jena Maric, executive director of the Greater Bridgeport Symphony, recalls a concert two years ago where the audience sat through a 15-minute downpour, undaunted. Afterward, she said, ''The biggest problem was finding enough paper toweling to dry off the musicians' chairs.''</p>
        <p>This year an outdoor pops concert is planned for 8 p.m. on June 24 on the Bellarmine Hall lawn at Fairfield University (rain date June 25, same time and place). Another pops program is planned Sept. 2 at the bandshell in Seaside Park in Bridgeport (rain date Sept. 3, same time and place). For information, call  (203) 576-0263.</p>
        <p>For 27 years the price has been right at the Levitt Pavilion for the Performing Arts in Westport. Admission to more than 50 nights of music and dance is free, with only two ticketed fund-raising events all summer (this year those feature the Beach Boys on July 27 and an evening of opera on Aug. 26).</p>
        <p>Opening night, June 25 at 8 p.m., is a blues and jazz party featuring calypso, limbo dancers, stilt-walkers and more.</p>
        <p>For a concert calendar or to order benefit tickets, call (203) 226-7600.</p>
        <p>For those who prefer the more predictable comforts of indoor listening, the 67th summer of South Shore Concerts is already under way. Artists' talks are held at 7 p.m., with the concerts beginning at 8 in the air-conditioned comfort of Saugatuck Congregational Church. Seven Friday-evening recitals remain: the pianist Adam Neiman on June 2, the Miro String Quartet on June 16 and the Jacques Thibaud Trio on June 30; the pianist Stella Simakova plays on July 14; the Brentano String Quartet on Aug. 4 and the violinist Joseph Lin on Aug. 25. A new piano trio, Menage, will make its debut at the series finale on Sept. 22 (203-227-0695).</p>
        <p>The summer series at Wesleyan has one outdoor attraction -- Abou Sylla performing music from West Africa at 7 p.m. on June 29 at Andrus Field -- but the pianist Neely Bruce begins the cycle in Russell House on June 27 at 7, unfazed by the challenge of performing all 48 of Bach's Preludes and Fugues in a single evening. He then returns to Crowell Hall on Aug. 3 at 8, at that time sampling Bach-inspired pieces by Chopin, Hindemith and Soulima Stravinsky and others. In between those keyboard events, you'll find dance programs, lectures on South Indian music, even a silent film with live organ accompaniment (860-685-3355).</p>
        <p>Music Mountain in Falls Village and the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival in Norfolk present their recitals in acoustically superior halls, but getting to the halls are also part of the pleasure.</p>
        <p>As Music Mountain's president Nicholas Gordon puts it, 'Wonderful grounds, woods, trails and paths lend a romantic air to this true musical oasis.'' An ensemble of performers from the former Soviet Union opens the season June 11 at 3 p.m., with the pianist Vladimir Feltsman, the father and son violinists Oleh and Peter Krysa, the violist Boris Deviatov and the cellist Yosif Feigelson.</p>
        <p>Thereafter, Sunday afternoons, and three Saturday nights as well, bring forth a parade of top-notch quartets including the Lark, Leontovitch, St. Petersburg, Shanghai, Blair, Ludwig, Whitman and da Ponte along with distinguished guest artists. The non-classical Saturdays add up to the 12th annual Jazz and Pop Series at the Mountain: the Galvanized Jazz Band on June 24 at 8, the Original Salty Dogs Jazz Band closing it Sept. 8. For a complete listing of programs and performers, or to make credit-card ticket reservations, call (860) 824-7126.</p>
