        <p>'What is it that Americans call Africa?'' asked the president of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo, looking up from his bowl of Rice Krispies. ''A basket case?'' The president was amused by the idiom, and a smile momentarily crossed his face. It was a bright morning in Abuja, Nigeria's capital, and the presidential peacocks, strutting outside Obasanjo's villa, were screeching in the heat.</p>
        <p>Obasanjo, who is a former general, a former political prisoner and, for the past year, the democratically elected president of Africa's biggest country, let the smile fade as he asked: ''And why is it a basket case? How did it come to be this basket case?''</p>

        <p>'What is it that Americans call Africa?'' asked the president of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo, looking up from his bowl of Rice Krispies. ''A basket case?'' The president was amused by the idiom, and a smile momentarily crossed his face. It was a bright morning in Abuja, Nigeria's capital, and the presidential peacocks, strutting outside Obasanjo's villa, were screeching in the heat.</p>
        <p>Obasanjo, who is a former general, a former political prisoner and, for the past year, the democratically elected president of Africa's biggest country, let the smile fade as he asked: ''And why is it a basket case? How did it come to be this basket case?''</p>
        <p>We were talking about Sierra Leone. More to the point, we were talking about blame. Whom do we blame for everything that has gone wrong in Sierra Leone? Certainly not Nigeria: Nigeria spent billions of its own dollars, and sacrificed the lives of hundreds of its soldiers, trying to keep the peace.</p>
        <p>Could it be the United States? We were the ones who forced a peace treaty on the people of Sierra Leone that gave one of the world's premier war criminals -- an exceedingly nasty man named Foday Sankoh -- a cabinet position, control over Sierra Leone's diamond mines and the license to take over the country by force. It was Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front, which specializes in limb hacking and child raping, that set off his country's civil chaos.</p>
        <p>In another part of the world -- in Europe, to be specific -- we would have held Sankoh accountable for his crimes. But this is Africa. In Africa, the American government, with the apparent approval of the American people, appeases evil in ways that would make even a Chamberlain blanch. In Liberia, for example, the warlord Charles Taylor made plain his intention to kill his way to power, and America acquiesced. He is now President Taylor, and he is a very rich man.</p>
        <p>There is a popular belief in Washington that Americans suffer from something called donor fatigue. We are tired, it is said, of emptying our pockets down the rat hole -- to use Jesse Helms's lovely phrase -- of foreign aid. But we can't be tired of something we don't do in the first place. We spend pocket change in Africa -- $1.25 per African (half a tall skim latte, in other words) each year. In Sierra Leone, our State Department recently boasted that we have provided just over $300 million in humanitarian aid since 1991. That's a little more than $1 from each American. Not a dollar per year -- a dollar over 10 years; a dime each year.</p>
        <p>While in Abuja, I happened to bump into Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economist who is a very angry man. Just about everyone agrees with Sachs that with an investment of $1 billion a year ($200 million of it from America), as many as half a million children who would otherwise die of malaria could be saved. Sachs calls it the 75-cent solution: 75 cents from each American to save thousands of African lives. But whenever he asks for aid (or, more important, debt relief), he gets the same answer. ''The administration says there is no support in Congress and among the American people,'' he told me. ''But they are amazingly unwilling to ask for anything, so how could they possibly know what the American people think?''</p>
        <p>With very little effort, America could have helped Sierra Leone by fully financing the Nigerian peacekeepers and establishing a war crimes tribunal. But we didn't, and now here we go again, readying ourselves for another round of CNN pictures of dead children on the streets of yet another African capital. The current miseries only harden the prevailing American attitude about Africa: that Africans themselves have no interest in creating order out of the chaos.</p>
        <p>President Obasanjo does not come from the blame-the-white-man school that holds long-dead imperialists responsible for all his continent's problems. Nigeria hasn't yet begun to recover from years of kleptocratic self-rule. But he is right to make the observation: ''If the world was ready to do in Sierra Leone what it did in Serbia, we would have a different story today.''</p>
        <p>Why was the world, or more specifically America, not ready to do that? Maybe it's because we don't believe Africans can be held to any recognizable moral standard. Slobodan Milosevic, in his white skin and suit and tie, is recognizable. He's one of us; he has broken our rules; he deserves punishment. Foday Sankoh, though, doesn't look like anything we understand.</p>
        <p>I will concede that Sierra Leone, from the perspective of the average American, is a deeply weird place. Once, in Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital, I met a member of the Kamajors, a traditional hunter society. He was wearing a red ronko, a ''war vest,'' which, he said, made him impervious to bullets. He was a little bit drunk, I think, and he proposed an experiment: I would wear the vest, and he would then fire bullets from his AK-47 at my chest. I declined, which made him dangerously upset. He threatened to shoot me without the benefit of the vest, for disrespecting his beliefs.</p>
        <p>I think about this man whenever Americans tell me that Africa is one great impenetrable, illogical mystery. I can't claim to understand his belief system, but I understand what gets him up the morning. The Kamajors know that the terrorists of the Revolutionary United Front are the bad guys, and they have lately been doing what they can to stop them.</p>
        <p>So who are the real basket cases? Are they the poor people who defy easy understanding but who are struggling against the chaos to restore a sane government? Or are they Americans, rich people who believe that in Africa, unlike anywhere else on the planet, chaos is the natural, inevitable state of being?</p>
