      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>For those who like their punk rock on the frothy pop side, the three-minute bratty anthems of Blink 182 are musical heaven. In concert, there are the added features of nudity (maybe), profanity (definitely) and a lesson in integrated colonics (why not, this tour promotes their four-million-selling CD, ''Enema of the State''). This is not to be confused with their two earlier tours, whose names are better left unsaid.</p>
        <p>The fact is, Blink 182, the heavily tattooed, multipierced Southern California post-punk trio is very good at what they do. They don't aspire to great art (Green Day seems like Mozart compared to these guys). They are just boys who want to have fun singing rapid-fire, bawdy post-punk ditties while naked (at least in their videos). And the energetic bubblegum-punk hits are there from the opening ''Dumpweed'' to the closing ''All the Small Things,'' with ''Dammit'' performed in between.</p>
