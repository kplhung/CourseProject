        <p>UNTIL now, the only ballets titled ''Anastasia'' have been about the Russian grand duchess who, legend has it, survived the murder of the imperial family by Bolshevik forces in 1918.

        <p>Nobody knows who Anastacia actually was, but one thing is sure: she was no grand duchess. According to Carlos de Lima, a Brazilian historian who consulted on the version of the story used for the plot of the 45-minute ''Black Anastacia,'' the blue-eyed beauty, now revered as a saint, was an African tribal queen taken to Brazil as a slave in the 17th century. As a housekeeper on a sugar cane plantation, Anastacia taught her fellow slaves to worship their native African gods -- a strictly forbidden practice -- under the guise of Christianity.</p>

        <p>UNTIL now, the only ballets titled ''Anastasia'' have been about the Russian grand duchess who, legend has it, survived the murder of the imperial family by Bolshevik forces in 1918. On Tuesday, however, an Afro-Brazilian Anastacia will arrive at the Joyce Theater as the heroine of a new ballet by DanceBrazil.</p>
        <p>Nobody knows who Anastacia actually was, but one thing is sure: she was no grand duchess. According to Carlos de Lima, a Brazilian historian who consulted on the version of the story used for the plot of the 45-minute ''Black Anastacia,'' the blue-eyed beauty, now revered as a saint, was an African tribal queen taken to Brazil as a slave in the 17th century. As a housekeeper on a sugar cane plantation, Anastacia taught her fellow slaves to worship their native African gods -- a strictly forbidden practice -- under the guise of Christianity.</p>
        <p>When her deception was discovered, Anastacia was forced to wear an iron mask to prevent her from speaking and became the concubine of a guard who secretly loved her. Soon after, according to Mr. de Lima, Anastacia died of gangrene, but not before her powers healed the sick and inspired hope of freedom among her fellow captive Africans.</p>
        <p>Several variations of the story exist. One says Anastacia was born not in Africa but in Brazil, to a slave and her Portuguese master, hence the blue eyes. Another proposes that Anastacia was repeatedly raped by the guard, but was successful in fending off attacks by the master, thus inspiring women today to have strength against abusive husbands. Since Anastacia was a common name given to slaves, her legend has also been considered an amalgam of the many female slaves who inspired healing, beauty and hope throughout the 300 years of slavery in Brazil.</p>
        <p>All of these stories might have been lost without the renegades within the black-consciousness movement in Brazil in the 1980's. According to John Burdick, a professor of anthropology at Syracuse University and the author of ''Blessed Anastacia: Women, Race and Popular Christianity in Brazil'' (Routledge), Anastacia was chosen by those Afro-Brazilians looking for ''an alternative to the separatist radicalism'' of the prevailing black movement, represented by Zumbi, a ''racially confrontational figure.'' Anastacia, who is revered for her strength in enduring hardship rather than her ability to fight it, was more apt to ''strengthen black self-esteem, promote racial harmony and help instill national pride in Brazil,'' Mr. Burdick wrote.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Anastacia became a mythic heroine, especially among Afro-Brazilian women, soon after her story was disseminated in church pamphlets, and she became the subject of popular radio and television programs.</p>
        <p>''Anastacia became known among nurses, who saw in her an exemplar of selfless healing,'' Mr. Burdick wrote. ''Prisoners became devotees, seeing in her an inspiration to patience in captivity. Her image began to proliferate in black beauty salons, as a model of the beautiful black woman.''</p>
        <p>Today, while many Brazilians know of Anastacia and her mysterious powers, most North Americans still do not. That is why DanceBrazil's founder and artistic director, Jelon Vieira, has chosen her as a subject for the company's forthcoming ballet. He and the choreographer of ''Black Anastacia,'' Carlos dos Santos Jr., a member of the Cleo Parker Robinson Dance Company in Colorado, are interested in making audiences in the United States aware of how African culture has influenced life, art and spirituality in Brazil.</p>
        <p>The story of Anastacia, no matter the version, is a perfect vehicle to accomplish this. ''We are keeping alive a very important piece of black history,'' said Mr. Vieira, speaking by telephone from his rehearsal studio in Brazil's northeastern state of Bahia. ''I hope it brings more understanding of the people of Brazil.''</p>
        <p>Though the company calls ''Black Anastacia'' a ballet, there will be no pirouettes on point. Rather, the 12 dancers and 4 capoeiristas will perform as many styles of movement as there are interpretations of the story of Anastacia. In addition to capoeira -- the high-energy, acrobatic martial art disguised as dance for which DanceBrazil has been known since it was founded in 1977 -- there will be elements of samba, the national dance of Brazil, as well as North American-derived modern and jazz dance. All of this will be performed to an original score composed by the percussionist Cyro Baptista and the electronic sound engineer and musician Peter Scherer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vieira says that because audiences have come to expect capoeira from DanceBrazil, they are sometimes disappointed when other dance styles are incorporated. But not to worry. The second of this week's premieres, ''Ginga,'' will feature capoeira prominently, along with other contemporary street dances of Bahia, home to most of DanceBrazil's company members and the vast majority of the Afro-Brazilian population. ''I'm celebrating the spirit and the movement that has been given to us by Africans,'' said Mr. Vieira, who choreographed the piece with a company member, Edileusa dos Santos (no relation to Carlos).</p>
        <p>''Ginga,'' which means ''swing'' in Portuguese, will also celebrate the 25th anniversary of Mr. Vieira's arrival in Manhattan, where DanceBrazil is officially based. Since moving in 1975, he has been credited with the growing influence of capoeira on contemporary dance. Afro-Brazilian music composed by Tote Gira will accompany the piece, played live on drums, acoustic guitar and the berimbau, a traditional one-stringed instrument central to the rhythm of capoeira.</p>
        <p>Bringing capoeira and the story of Anastacia to the United States is just one way in which DanceBrazil is helping broaden the understanding of Brazilian culture. Together with Cleo Parker Robinson and her Denver-based company, Mr. Vieira and Mr. dos Santos have also begun a Brazilian-American dance exchange, in which teachers and students from a variety of backgrounds learn about one another through dance. Mr. Vieira is quick to point out, however, that this is not an example of globalization. ''I see globalization as Americanizing the world -- a model of colonization,'' he said. ''This is more of a cultural exchange.''</p>
        <p>Mr. dos Santos, who also spoke by telephone from Brazil, said that with these projects, he hopes primarily to inspire ''a little bit more compassion for the other.''</p>
