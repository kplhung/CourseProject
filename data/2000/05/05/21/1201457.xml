        <p>Tiger Woods held a two-stroke lead after the Deutsche Bank-SAP Open's third round yesterday in Alveslohe, Germany, firing a five-under-par 67 and separating himself from the pack with a strong finish.</p>
        <p>Woods was locked in a battle with numerous players at the top of the leaderboard all day until he pulled away with 15th and 17th hole birdies to complete his three rounds with a total of nine under 207 at the $2.7 million event.</p>
        <p>There were five players tied for second at seven-under 209, including three European Ryder Cup players.</p>
        <p>''I'm playing better day by day,'' said Woods, who had five birdies and no bogeys. I'm very pleased. I just tried to make some solid shots and it worked, I didn't drop a shot all day.</p>
        <p>The event, with one of the highest purses ever offered in Europe outside of a major, has drawn the entire European Ryder Cup team for the first time since they played the Americans last summer.</p>
        <p>CINK SURGES TO LEAD: Stewart Cink did not mind playing extra holes yesterday in the Colonial in Fort Worth.</p>
        <p>''It was a long day. On the flip side though, it was a good day to come out with your stuff because you get to play more than one round and take advantage of it,'' Cink said playing 31 holes in 10 under to take the lead.</p>
        <p>Cink is at 11-under 199 and carries a three-stroke lead over Davis Love III into the final round today, which is Cink's 27th birthday. Love had five birdies and four bogeys in his third round of 1-under 69.</p>
        <p>Forced to play the final 13 holes of his rain-delayed second round yesterday morning, Cink carded five straight birdies for a 64 to move within a stroke of the co-leaders Love and David Toms.</p>
        <p>''That never hurts you confidence, it only helps,'' Cink said of his birdie stretch from Nos. 2-6.</p>
        <p>And that feeling carried over into his afternoon round with Love and Toms.</p>
        <p>Cink had four birdies over a six-hole stretch -- Nos. 7-12. He took the lead with a long birdie putt at the 402-yard 9th, which he followed with birdies at the 404-yard 10th and the 433-yard 12th. He had just one bogey in his third-round 65.</p>
        <p>COLBERT MAINTAINS LEAD: Jim Colbert tapped in a 6-inch birdie putt on the final hole for a 3-under-par 69 yesterday and a two-stroke lead over Dana Quigley after two rounds of the TD Waterhouse Championship in Kansas City, Mo.</p>
        <p>Colbert, who shot a course-record 61 on Friday, is at 14-under-par 130 going into today's final round. Quigley, with a 67 on Saturday, stood at 132.</p>
        <p>SORENSTAM AND BURTON LEAD: Annika Sorenstam and Brandie Burton shot 7-under-par 65s yesterday to share the lead heading into the final round of the Firstar L.P.G.A. Classic in Beavercreek, Ohio.</p>
        <p>Sorenstam and Burton, each of whom shot 66 in the opening round at the Country Club of the North, now stand at 13-under 131, matching the tournament record set by Meg Mallon two years ago.</p>
        <p>After a 69, the first-round leader, Mi Hyun Kim, was alone in second place at 12 under followed by Karrie Webb, who was another shot back after two late bogeys left her with a 68.</p>
