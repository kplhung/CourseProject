        <p>In the wake of the collapse last week of Boo.com, a high-profile European Internet retailer, a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers warned that 7 of Britain's 28 publicly traded Internet companies could run out of cash in the next six months, while fewer than half had enough cash to last through the next 15 months.</p>
        <p>The study calculated the companies' ''burn rate'' based on their latest reported balance-sheet cash, gross profits and cash expenses, and factored in 130 percent annual growth, described as typical for Internet commerce. No link was found between a company's burn rate and the performance of its stock.</p>
