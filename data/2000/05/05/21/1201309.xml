        <p>''Each day brings an exciting new chapter, as unexpected relationships develop and personal dramas unfold before our cameras.''</p>
        <p>That quote is not from a reporter covering the roiling New York Senate race.</p>
        <p>That quote is from Mark Burnett, the producer of ''Survivor,'' CBS's new summer ''reality-adventure series,'' which maroons eight men and eight women on the tiny island of Pulau Tiga, off the coast of Borneo, for a video version of ''Lord of the Flies.''</p>
        <p>At the end of each show, a tribal council votes to expel one of the ''courageous thrill-seekers,'' as CBS calls them, from the island -- presumably a guy who lets his alpha side run amok or a girl who doesn't look fetching in a coconut-shell bra. The last one left wins $1 million.</p>
        <p>In CBS's ''Big Brother,'' 10 strangers are isolated in a house full of cameras. Viewers decide which one to kick out each week. The last one gets half a mil.</p>
        <p>The two shows spring from America's obsessions with reality, personality and money. We are a nation of voyeurs, addicted to lurid real-life dramas. On TV, producers heighten the reality, adding physical obstacles or psychological pressures. In politics, the reality's been sizzling on its own.</p>
        <p>The most remarkable aspect of the remarkable Giuliani saga was that he dropped out of the race to concentrate on his health, not because of his brazen personal behavior. The polls reflected no outrage.</p>
        <p>The commentators who huffed last week that the mayor had lost the moral authority to run for the Senate missed the point. People can live with public officials who are not moral exemplars. They now rate pols the same way they'll rate ''Survivor'' contestants: Who maneuvers skillfully in a tough situation? Who gets stuff done? Who entertains us?</p>
        <p>In the past, people did not want reality. They wanted perfection, and they preferred having the flaws and blemishes of their leaders concealed.</p>
        <p>They preferred the ideal Franklin Roosevelt to the real Franklin Roosevelt, confined in his wheelchair. They preferred the ideal Jack and Jackie to the real Jack and Jackie, who did not exactly inhabit Camelot.</p>
        <p>Joe Kennedy Sr. was the master at bringing Hollywood illusion to the White House, air-brushing out Jack's sexcapades and health crises.</p>
        <p>Thirty years later, Bill Clinton reversed the Kennedy formula, exchanging glamorous illusion for mesmerizing reality. He revealed the decidedly mottled nature of the people who work and play in the White House, providing the American public with another adventure in voyeurism.</p>
        <p>We tuned in for a daily fix of ''White House Survivor.'' Would Hillary brain Bill? Would Monica betray Bill? Would Bill outrun Ken? Would the nasty Republicans do themselves in?</p>
        <p>No one could foresee that the public would enjoy watching Bill run his obstacle course so much that it would overlook the moral dimension.</p>
        <p>Dumbfounded politicos declared Bill Clinton an anomaly --but lo and behold, here is another anomaly.</p>
        <p>Rudy Giuliani has just staged a breathtaking reality drama of his own. He, too, has laid himself bare, humbly observing, ''You realize you are not a superman and you are just a human being.'' Again the public preferred enjoying the show to judging it.  We all tune in for our daily fix of ''City Hall Survivor.'' Will Rudy beat cancer? Will Donna avenge herself on Rudy? Will Rudy marry Judi? How long before we sour on the mayor's new sweetness? Can Rudy pass donors on to little Ricky?</p>
        <p>It's not that we don't want moral character in our leaders. We'd love it. But the great maw of entertainment has worn us down. We'll settle for the good policies of flawed people. Anyway, we now know about Sally Hemings, etc. The profession of politics does not attract saints.</p>
        <p>In recent years, we have become a biographical culture. We are riveted by the soap operas of public lives. We admire the famous most for what makes them infamous: it reassures us that they are no better and no happier than all the people with their noses pressed hard against the glass.</p>
        <p>Misery loves celebrated company.</p>
        <p>The challenge that now confronts America is the dispiriting prospect of a presidential campaign between two candidates who seem to have no heartrending secrets to hide and reveal.</p>
        <p>Reality without reality drama. How can we stand it?</p>
