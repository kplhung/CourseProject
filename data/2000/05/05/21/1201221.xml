        <p>Eerily, none of the doctors and nurses in the terra cotta murals that adorn the empty patients' pavilions at Sea View Hospital on Staten Island are shown using the tools of Western medicine. They do not perform examinations, and they do not dispense medicine. Instead, they offer comfort, mostly to children. Here a medical man in vest, starched collar and umber tie guides a blind boy in knickers. There a nurse props a sickly infant on her hip.</p>
        <p>When it opened in 1914, the 1,100-bed hilltop hospital was the largest tuberculosis sanitarium in the country. But a cure for the frequently fatal disease -- the hospital would play an important role in finding it -- was still decades away. Often, giving comfort was the beginning and end of treatment. The only other measures then available to help the ill are still present in the pavilions: fresh air, and in the case of the murals, beauty.</p>
        <p>The building's fourth-floor balconies were designed to catch the faintly briny winds that climb up the hill from Lower New York Bay. The sick, some of whom were wheeled onto the balconies in their beds, would lie in the breeze beneath terra cotta friezes of blooming flowers, turquoise scallop shells and the staff of Aesculapius, the great healer of classic mythology.</p>
        <p>Some recovered; many did not.</p>
        <p>Today, the murals are faded and cracked from years of exposure to sun and rain. In 1952, after successful clinical trials at Sea View, doctors could at last treat tuberculosis patients with a powerful antibiotic. The sanitarium slowly closed. And though the hospital shifted to caring for the elderly in 1961, many of its buildings were locked for lack of patients.</p>
        <p>Recently, preservationists have tried to bring attention to the murals. Last year, the Preservation League of New York State placed the Sea View campus on its statewide list of seven endangered historic sites. The campus, owned by the city, is on 154 acres. And last month, the Preservation League of Staten Island sponsored a rare public tour of one of the four pavilions that remain from the original eight. In July, the Municipal Arts Society plans to mount an exhibition about Sea View and the Farm Colony, a former county poor farm nearby, which together make up a historic district declared a landmark by the city.</p>
        <p>Susan Tunick, an expert in architectural ceramics and the president of the Friends of Terra Cotta, said the Dutch company Joost Thooft &amp; Labouchere (established in 1655) manufactured the Sea View murals. Before the company shipped the tiles in 1911, it put them on exhibit in the city of Haarlem.</p>
        <p>Though the murals now tell a poignant tale, their vivid coloring caused a stir at the time. A critic who saw the Haarlem exhibit concluded that the murals lacked traditional restraint but would probably appeal to their intended audience. ''The whole is bold, American-like, and not at all mean,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>More charitably, Ms. Tunick said that compared with similar murals in New York City, ''this is as good as it gets.''</p>
