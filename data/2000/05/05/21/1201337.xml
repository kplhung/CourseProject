        <p>Kemper Distributors was censured and  assessed a penalty of $100,000 by the National Association of Securities Dealers last week because of what the N.A.S.D. described as inaccuracies in mutual fund advertisements that continued to appear  even after the company had been asked to stop them.

        <p>Eight advertisements that appeared  The Wall Street Journal, Barron's and other publications between April and September 1997 overstated the return on a hypothetical $10,000 investment made at the 1988 inception of the firm's Kemper-Dreman High Return Equity fund, according to an N.A.S.D. report. A graph in one of the ads suggested that such an investment would have been worth $23,000 at the end of 1991 and $29,000 by the end of 1994; the correct figures would have been $17,000 in 1991 and $22,000 in 1994.</p>

        <p>Kemper Distributors was censured and  assessed a penalty of $100,000 by the National Association of Securities Dealers last week because of what the N.A.S.D. described as inaccuracies in mutual fund advertisements that continued to appear  even after the company had been asked to stop them. In settling the case, Kemper Distributors, the sales arm of Kemper Funds, neither admitted nor denied the findings.</p>
        <p>Eight advertisements that appeared  The Wall Street Journal, Barron's and other publications between April and September 1997 overstated the return on a hypothetical $10,000 investment made at the 1988 inception of the firm's Kemper-Dreman High Return Equity fund, according to an N.A.S.D. report. A graph in one of the ads suggested that such an investment would have been worth $23,000 at the end of 1991 and $29,000 by the end of 1994; the correct figures would have been $17,000 in 1991 and $22,000 in 1994.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Kemper called the errors ''technical infractions'' and said it  had implemented new policies to ensure that they did not recur.</p>
        <p>Kemper was also accused of violating N.A.S.D. rules in a March 1997 ad that showed a straight line sloping up, with the low end labeled ''you are here'' and the high end marked ''your future is here.''</p>
        <p>''The straight upwardly sloping line did not convey the risks of fluctuating prices inherent in investing,'' the N.A.S.D. statement said.</p>
        <p>For the next six months, Kemper has agreed to submit all graphs, bar charts or pie charts in its advertising to the N.A.S.D. for review before use.</p>
