        <p>LAN SAMANTHA CHANG cringes when she's told she's the next Amy Tan or Maxine Hong Kingston -- that she is the next great female Asian-American writer.</p>
        <p>''When my book came out, immediately there were two reviews that put me in this group with these Asian-American women writers,'' said Ms. Chang, crinkling her face and cringing at the thought. ''Others started comparing me to Jewish writers. I don't know how to feel about all of it.''</p>
        <p>What has raised expectations about Ms. Chang is ''Hunger'' (Penguin Books, $12.95), a novella and story collection that has earned a collection of outstanding reviews.</p>
        <p>All this for a woman who didn't take a writing course until she was in graduate school, whose career has blossomed late -- fortunately so, in her mind.</p>
        <p>''I was older, well past the age where you could be said to be precocious,'' said the 35-year-old Ms. Chang, who is at Princeton University on an Alfred Hodder Fellowship, given to allow young artists to pursue their work with freedom for a year.</p>
        <p>''I was a precocious violin player, but then adolescence came,'' she said over lunch at the elegant Lahieres Restaurant in downtown Princeton. ''Adolescence weeds out those with a true calling from those who are just talented. I'm glad I didn't write until later, so I didn't have to go through the same thing with my writing.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Chang's tales are primarily of Chinese immigrants to America and their tribulations about leaving one culture behind for a new and often strange one. Typical is the beginning of ''The Unforgetting,'' one of the short stories in the collection:</p>
        <p>''On the summer day in 1967 when Ming Hwang first saw the eastern Iowa hills, he pulled his car off the road and stopped the engine. He felt overwhelmed, as if he had arrived once more at the sea that he had crossed to reach America and his destiny lay again upon some faraway shore. The neat, green fields rolled out to meet the sky. The narrow strip of highway looked barely navigable. Surely no Chinese man could ever have laid eyes upon this place before.''</p>
        <p>Despite spending most of her adult life on the two coasts -- she has degrees from Yale and the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and was a Wallace Stegner writing fellow at Stanford -- there is a great feeling for the Midwest in Ms. Chang's writing.</p>
        <p>In fact, she grew up in Appleton, Wis. -- home of Harry Houdini and Senator Joseph McCarthy -- where her father was a chemical engineer, researching paper science at Lawrence University. Hers was one of two Chinese-American families in the small city, both of whose children were all girls.</p>
        <p>''It's intrinsic to her work that her parents were immigrants,'' said Peter Rock, who was a Stegner Fellow with Ms. Chang at Stanford and now teaches writing at the University of Pennsylvania. ''But it's more important that she grew up in Appleton.</p>
        <p>''When she came to speak at my class, she named several influences in her writing who were white males,'' said Mr. Rock. ''The Asian-American women were upset, saying, 'Aren't you selling out?' All of the people who I know who have had success writing and who are ethnic have to put up with that.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Chang is using her year at Princeton to research and write a novel, to be published by Norton, based on events in Hang Zhou (Hang Chow) and Chong Qing (Chung King), China, in the 1930's and 40's. She has spent hours poring over old maps and guidebooks in Princeton's Oriental collection.</p>
        <p>''When my parents came to visit, we all went over there,'' she said. ''They helped me with the Chinese. It was great fun for all of us.''</p>
        <p>Her father had wanted Ms. Chang and her three sisters to become doctors, so they would never have to worry about security. But uninterested in medicine, she pursued a degree in Asian studies at Yale and then went to the Kennedy School. Eventually, one  sister fulfilled her father's wishes.</p>
        <p>''I knew I would come out of there with my dream -- the kind of job where you would wear pantyhose,'' she said. ''Life would make sense if I took these economics courses. Unfortunately, I came to the realization that I hated it.''</p>
        <p>She decided to take a writing course, but not at Harvard.</p>
        <p>''That would have been too hard,'' she said. ''I would have been too insecure to show my writing to Harvard undergraduates.''</p>
        <p>Instead, she went to the Cambridge Center for Adult Education. She wrote and wrote and, after getting her Harvard degree, went straight to the University of Iowa writers program. She published a story in The Atlantic Monthly, and agents called her saying they could get a book contract.</p>
        <p>''I was 28 and I wasn't ready for a book,'' she said. ''I was afraid of being that young writer whose acclaim surprised me into silence. I wanted to wait until I knew what and who I wanted to be as a writer. I wanted to be, well, serious.</p>
        <p>''Being a young writer of color, I'm lucky to have had the time to find my voice,'' she said. ''The bridge between the first and second book is difficult. There are now expectations.''</p>
        <p>Even now, some of those expectations come from her parents. When they visited last month and Ms. Chang gave a reading from ''Hunger,'' Joyce Carol Oates, the practiced and prolific author who teaches at Princeton, was there to meet them. And in the Oriental library, Ms. Chang found out something new about them.</p>
        <p>''It turns out they were just like me, loving stories and looking at history,'' she said. ''It's just that they hid it much of the time. We didn't have books around when I was a child. To my parents, they were too much baggage. But it turns out they were just too heavy to carry when they were escaping from the Japanese invasions, when they would have to move quickly.</p>
        <p>''When we came to the library together, they took out books and loved the whole experience,'' she said. ''Being a close-knit family and somewhat isolated in Wisconsin, they are what I draw from for my stories. So it is wonderful to find a new aspect with them.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Chang's novel will not appear until next year, by which time she will be on another fellowship at Radcliffe. But she has already given thought to coming back to New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''Princeton is a wonderful kind of place, where you can feel both anonymous and part of a greater world,'' she said, pointing out several accomplished faculty members in Lahieres. ''It's a quiet place with intense people, which, despite appearances is what a writer is -- quiet and intense.''</p>
        <p>A Sternness Born of Love</p>
        <p>An excerpt from ''Hunger'' by Lan Samantha Chang.</p>
        <p>Ruth grew tall and almost painfully slender; in the sixth grade, she began to practice on Tian's full-sized violin.  At 14, she won a citywide competition for young musicians. As the winner, she would perform a concerto, accompanied by the orchestra that had sponsored the competition. Tian had chosen the Sibelius concerto, and for many, many months he and Ruth practiced those wondrous loops of sound, the joyous slithering movements of Sibelius.</p>
        <p>He treated her as cruelly as he did himself with complete disregard for her age and temperament. But she did not complain to me or Anna. She would play and sob for hours, but emerge from the room without a word. She believed, she had known from infancy, that she held him in her hands. Now he had replaced his tenderness with this stern passion and she followed him there, believing the source of his sternness lay in love. In this blindness, I began to see, she and her father were alike.</p>
        <p>All morning during summer vacations, plus two evenings a week, he sat in the tiny room for hours and helped her practice. I remember the way he looked at her when things went well; intense, prideful, the dispassionate yet hungry stare that I learned to recognize on television in coaches or trainers as they watch the taut bodies of their favorites. They exchanged few words; just an occasional ''no,'' or ''again,'' or ''tone.'' ''Bad fingering.'' ''Again, again.''</p>
        <p>Ruth did not grimace or stop to complain. To this day I hold an image of them practicing under the skylight: Tian in the corner with his impenetrable and hungry gaze, and Ruth, stark-faced, her clear features lit gold or gray from above, lips pale and nostrils flared; her half-closed eyes, shadowed beneath.</p>
        <p>Her long-sleeved T-shirt flapped as she moved her arms. Her days were filled with school and practicing, carrying some enormous weight. It must be difficult to find some time to think, living as she was under the spotlight of her father's fierce attention.</p>
