        <p>What does ''home life'' mean to New Yorkers? What objects, people and places evoke comfort and nostalgia? ''New York Inside Out,'' a photographic exhibit at the New-York Historical Society, explores these questions.</p>
        <p>Almost a year ago,  New Yorkers from all five boroughs responded to the historical society's request to submit photographs for the show. About 100 are on display and many more have been collected in scrapbooks.</p>
        <p>Most people interpreted ''home'' to mean the people they cared about or places they lived; the kitchen table and television set were the commonest objects. Others chose special occasions, like Angela Z. Reddin, who sent in the picture  (above) of her mother, Margaret Caravella, preparing for her wedding in 1946.</p>
        <p>''New York Inside Out,'' through Aug. 20, Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street; $5; students and people over 65, $3; 12 and under free; (212) 873-3400.</p>
