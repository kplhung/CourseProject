        <p>He is a Philadelphia native who grafted European training methods onto his conditioning regimen, and seven years ago he pretty much thought he was out of the horse training business. Seven years ago, Joe Orseno had 10 second-rate horses trying to clump their way around the track at the Meadowlands.</p>
        <p>Now, he has the Preakness Stakes champion, Red Bullet, a claim on the title of giant-killer after thumping what was last week's superhorse and today's odds-on favorite, Fusaichi Pegasus, and an owner who appears to be buying racetracks at the same rate he breeds and buys horses.</p>
        <p>''I'm pretty high right now,'' a flushed and excited Orseno said after Red Bullet spoiled an opportunity for horse racing to take a fourth consecutive Triple Crown attempt to Belmont Park.</p>
        <p>How the 44-year-old Orseno ended up in the winner's circle here so shortly after he thought he was out of the business is as much about making brave decisions as it is about trying hard with third-rate stock on thoroughbred racing's second-rate circuits.</p>
        <p>In 1997, Frank Stronach, then a Canadian industrialist, sent a half-dozen horses to Orseno at Monmouth. These were better than the old and often infirm low-level claimers that Orseno held together to win training titles at Atlantic City, Garden State Park and Delaware Park.</p>
        <p>Stronach immediately spotted Orseno's talent for extracting speed and nursing health out of the fragile animals by his unorthodox method of controlled gallops.</p>
        <p>He also noticed how Orseno's veterinarian bills were lower than any other trainer he had come across. In 1998, Stronach hired him to overlook 40 or more of the best horses in North America.</p>
        <p>Orseno's fitness theory was simple: if a horse couldn't complete three, four, five easy gallops of two miles a week at say two minutes, then how was it going to go as fast as it could at race time? ''It's just like conditioning a human athlete,'' he said. ''They have to have a foundation or they will come up with nicks and pains.''</p>
        <p>Four weeks ago, after the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct, Orseno and Stronach had to uphold this tenet with a tough decision. Red Bullet, who had not raced as a 2-year-old, had added to Fusaichi Pegasus' legend by getting beat by better than 4 lengths that day.</p>
        <p>It was Red Bullet's first loss in three starts and, though Stronach had never run in the Kentucky Derby, owner and trainer met immediately after the race and decided not to ship to Louisville, Ky.</p>
        <p>''When a horse doesn't finish well, it takes more out of him than you think,'' Stronach said. ''I knew then we weren't going. My heart said it would be nice; my head said not to go.''</p>
        <p>The trainer who had fine-tuned a European conditioner's penchant for slow gallops agreed. Red Bullet had lost 16 pounds after the Wood -- that day. The Philly fighter in Orseno wanted a rematch; but he knew the colt needed five weeks to grow into his still maturing frame. When he watched Fusaichi Pegasus win the Derby on television, two things occurred to him. One was surprising, the other not at all.</p>
        <p>''I thought I'd be disappointed when they broke from the gate without us,'' Orseno said. ''I wasn't. I also knew we had a very talented horse and we weren't going to duck the winner. Many people thought we were running for second money but I didn't believe that.''</p>
        <p>Over those five weeks between the Wood and today, the colt gained back the 16 pounds and added another 10.</p>
        <p>He also picked up a new rider, Jerry Bailey, who replaced Alex Solis when he decided to take the mount on the Kentucky Derby runner-up Aptitude -- a closer who will be at the Belmont in three weeks.</p>
        <p>''They did right by the horse, and not too many people would have done that,'' Bailey said of Stronach's and Orseno's decision to skip the Derby.</p>
        <p>Unlike Red Bullet's race in the Wood, he was allowed to lope along far behind the front-runners today -- even behind Fusaichi Pegasus until heading into the final turn. But at the top of the turn, Bailey fired Red Bullet between Snuck In on his inside and Kent Desormeaux and Fusaichi Pegasus on the outside.</p>
        <p>''My plan was to get the jump on the favorite,'' Bailey said. ''I didn't know if I could win, but I knew I'd have a good horse beneath me.''</p>
        <p>When Bailey inched his length lead over Fusaichi Pegasus into just short of another length, the trainer who in 1993 was sitting in New Jersey with 10 everyday horses was skipping down the steps to Pimlico Race Course's winner's circle.</p>
        <p>Stronach was not far behind. He had a week of picking up prizes. Earlier this week he bought Bay Meadows in San Francisco and added it to his already ample holdings of a half-dozen tracks, including Santa Anita Park in California and Gulfstream Park in Florida.</p>
        <p>Neither committed to sending Red Bullet to New York and the Belmont. But Orseno promised to do what he had done over 20 years of training horses that didn't have enormous talent to communicate.</p>
        <p>''Believe me,'' he said. ''This horse will tell us what to do.''</p>
