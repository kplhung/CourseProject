        <p>Robert W Stern letter on April 30 discussion between Ned Rorem and Stephen Sondheim on opera and musicals praises New York City Opera's short-lived production of Jerome Moross's Gentlemen, Be Seated!</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read with bemused interest the dialogue between Ned Rorem and Stephen Sondheim titled ''Musical or Opera: Which Is It?'' [April 30]. In the early 60's, I was privileged to be in the nearly sold-out premiere audience for the New York City Opera presentation of Jerome Moross's ''Gentlemen, Be Seated!'' Naively, I thought that this would be a hit, but I did not reckon with the power of a New York Times review which said that the work did not belong in the opera house but in a Broadway theater. Friends who I know had been raving about ''Gentlemen, Be Seated!'' 12 hours earlier were now pooh-poohing the work as not being worthy of their time. I attended two more performances in a much-depleted house and continued to enjoy the show thoroughly as a wonderful piece of social commentary and satire with memorable music. Opera house -- Broadway theater -- this should not be a matter of real estate but rather one of content and aesthetics, and I defy anyone to say that certain works of Sondheim, Gershwin, Bernstein and Moross, among countless others who have contributed to the American musical heritage, do not ''belong'' in an opera house.</p>
