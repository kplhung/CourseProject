        <p>WHEN ''The Glass Menagerie'' turns up on a company's schedule at this point in the year, there is a temptation to dismiss it as an end-of-the-season throwaway -- a sop for the troupe's grande dame, perhaps, or simply an easily staged bridge to summer vacation. It is a work so loved by so many that a lazy production is all that's needed -- hey, everyone knows the story anyway, and why even try to top Laurette Taylor, Maureen Stapleton, George Grizzard, Piper Laurie, Treat Williams and all the other great actors who have inhabited the play over the years?</p>

        <p>WHEN ''The Glass Menagerie'' turns up on a company's schedule at this point in the year, there is a temptation to dismiss it as an end-of-the-season throwaway -- a sop for the troupe's grande dame, perhaps, or simply an easily staged bridge to summer vacation. It is a work so loved by so many that a lazy production is all that's needed -- hey, everyone knows the story anyway, and why even try to top Laurette Taylor, Maureen Stapleton, George Grizzard, Piper Laurie, Treat Williams and all the other great actors who have inhabited the play over the years?</p>
        <p>But there is nothing lazy about the taut, trenchant production now being offered by the 12 Miles West Theater Company in Montclair. The four-member cast is neither intimidated by the Tennessee Williams classic nor seduced by its familiarity.</p>
        <p>This story of the smothering Southern belle, her wanderlusting son and her shy daughter, three lost souls whose lives are changed by the visit of a Gentleman Caller, is usually a showcase for the mother, the Amanda Wingfield character.</p>
        <p>Gloria Falzer plays the role nicely here, but not overpoweringly; Tim Wright as her son, Tom, is her perfect counterbalance. Their interplay near the end of Act I, when Tom announces that he has arranged for a male friend to come calling, is a pleasure, Mr. Wright deftly walking the line between making fun of Amanda and making a mockery of her.</p>
        <p>The eye-opening performance, however, comes from Stacy Fischer as Laura Wingfield, the young woman who has let a physical defect become a prison. Laura is often played as merely timid, a young girl in a somewhat-older-girl body. But Ms. Fischer injects pathology into the part. It wasn't until 35 years after ''Menagerie'' was written that psychiatrists came up with the label ''social phobia'' for the illness of extreme, debilitating shyness, but to see Ms. Fischer's terrified Laura, doubled over with anxiety merely because the doorbell is ringing, is to believe that is what the playwright had in mind.</p>
        <p>The three ride Williams's masterful dialogue skillfully; by the end of the first act we know everything there is to know about the three Wingfields. And then comes the Gentleman Caller. Michael Stewart Allen is an inspired stroke of casting here, adroitly mixing braggadocio and bluntness, hamhandedness and heart. The scene late in the play where he draws out Laura and then disappoints her is a masterpiece of hope and pain.</p>
        <p>The production's director and designer, Lenny Bart, has made 12 Miles West's tiny theater and spot lighting work beautifully for him. Williams's words have, of course, proved compelling enough to captivate a Broadway house, but in these close quarters they develop an almost gravitational pull. With the actors only a few feet away, the audience members (particularly on the left side of the semicircular house) are drawn right into the Wingfields' tension-filled home; they might find themselves fighting the impulse to intervene in the gathering tragedy.</p>
        <p>For some plays, the goal is to wrap everything up neatly, with justice having been done, a happily-ever-after ending secured or a puzzle resolved. For ''The Glass Menagerie,'' however, success is measured in whether the audience leaves the theater wanting to know more -- what became of the fragile Laura, her wandering brother, their deluded mother, the optimistic Gentleman Caller? Even those who have seen this wonderful play many times are likely to leave 12 Miles West's production with these questions echoing afresh.</p>
