        <p>SUMMER approaches, ushering in the joys of baseball, cookouts, family vacations and, of course, summer reading.</p>
        <p>Everyone knows what baseball, cookouts and vacations are, but what about that summer reading? Is it somehow different from fall, winter and spring reading? Who does it? And why? An unscientific survey revealed the answer: summer reading is what summer readers say it is.</p>
        <p>The why question can be answered two ways. Although most readers read because they want to, there are some readers who read because they must -- -literally.</p>
        <p>They might be called coerced-student summer readers. With all the enthusiasm of prisoners on a forced march, coerced-student summer readers typically flood public libraries a week or so before school starts.</p>
        <p>Leslie Dickinson, an adult services librarian at the Public Library in Yonkers, N.Y., has a ringside seat.</p>
        <p>''Every school around here requires their students to read at least two books over the summer,'' she explained. ''They rush in and ask which books on the list we have Cliff's Notes for. Then if we don't have any of those, they ask for a video. If we don't have a video, they ask about an audio version. If none of those is available they ask, 'What's the skinniest book I can get away with?'  Though I admit one mother did make a good case for using a book on tape. She said that by playing something good while they were riding in the car she could pique their interest and get them to read other things.''</p>
        <p>In her opinion, it would help if the required reading lists included livelier selections. The good ones offer choices for a range of reading abilities and include a mix of classics and contemporary books, including some of Oprah Winfrey's book club picks. ''Others,'' Ms. Dickinson said sadly, ''have the same dreary things that've been there forever.''</p>
        <p>Nancy Zachary, the young adult librarian in Scarsdale, N.Y., has also observed summer force-feeding, even to young people who like to read. ''Parents will come in and say they want their kids to read classics,'' she said. ''But if the kids are real readers, I think what they really like is to go through a book a day.''</p>
        <p>Because so many adults have been conditioned to think that summer is a good time to read the classics, is there a waiting list for Proust and Euripides?</p>
        <p>If there is, those in a position to know have not noticed. According to Joan Ripley, owner of the Second Story Bookshop in Chappaqua, N.Y., ''One or two people decide to read only classics on vacation. The other 98 percent want current nonfiction and all types of fiction.''</p>
        <p>There is an occasional exception like Seamus Heaney's best-selling version of Beowulf, but, Ms. Ripley noted that besides being a brilliant translation, it was ''very thin.'' Ms. Dickinson concurs with that assessment: ''I suspect that Modern Library's list of the 100 best books is largely populated with what you planned to read on your summer vacation and never got to.''</p>
        <p>Book lovers know quality and pleasure are not mutually exclusive, but can anything be learned about character by examining an individual's choices in reading material? Willard Gaylin, a psychiatrist from Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., declined to touch that one, though he was willing to disclose his own habits. For being trapped on an airplane with no alternatives, ''my wife, Betty, and I have different theories,'' said Mr. Gaylin, a Columbia University professor and psychoanalyst. ''She takes an easy read that she knows she will enjoy. I take a hard read because I don't have the discipline to read it otherwise. I refuse to buy anything fun and exciting or that I know I would love.''</p>
        <p>Once they arrive at their destination, the strategy changes. The Gaylins begin sharing books to lighten their load. ''We are big readers and we usually agree on books before the trip so we can swap halfway through,'' he said. ''We take paperbacks and usually tear them apart as we read them. Whether it's undershirts, underpants or books, portability and disposability are important to us.''</p>
        <p>Those criteria would not surprise Sydny Miner, a senior editor at Simon &amp; Schuster, who says that the publishing industry does consider summer reading a category. She calls such books ''mind candy'' and says they tend to be paperbacks.</p>
        <p>Librarians are seeing shifts in summer reading patterns.</p>
        <p>''We used to have a huge collection of paperbacks especially marked for summer, and people would come in June and check them out to take to the beach or the mountains,'' she said. ''But we haven't had a summer loan program for the last 10 to 12 years.''</p>
        <p>In other words, summer reading does not necessarily take place in the summer, cannot be categorized by type of book, and may not even exist in traditional forms.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gaylin, who reads voraciously, always takes a book to the beach but never reads it.</p>
        <p>''I end up watching people,'' he said. ''The young parents. Their kids. The dramas and the themes.'' Sometimes the best summer read is outside the pages of a book.</p>
