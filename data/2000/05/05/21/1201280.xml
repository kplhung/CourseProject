        <p>They sounded at times as if they were running for actuary-in-chief.</p>
        <p>''Eight years from now, the massive baby-boomer generation will begin drawing benefits,'' declared Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore countered, ''The numbers just don't add up, and under the Bush plan a serious reduction of our national debt is simply impossible.''</p>
        <p>The issue under discussion by the presumptive Republican and Democratic nominees for president was a vital one, if not exactly the sort that stops voters' hearts: how to protect the Social Security system, which both candidates say is slowly going broke. Speaking in Southern California, Mr. Bush announced a plan for reforming the federal retirement-benefits system that would allow workers to invest some of their payroll taxes in private accounts.</p>
        <p>''There is a fundamental difference between my opponent and me,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He trusts the government to manage our retirement. I trust individual Americans.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore argued that Mr. Bush's plan misplaces its trust by exposing workers' retirement money to the mercy of the markets and making it impossible for the government to pay down the national debt. ''Tens of millions of investors who have not gone through the Fordham Business School,'' Mr. Gore said, ''would be placed in a situation where a lot of financial shenanigans could take place.''</p>
        <p>The vice president also revealed a protective streak with his own investments. After Mr. Bush told reporters that Mr. Gore had a lot of money in stocks, Mr. Gore replied that he had not invested in the markets in 25 years for fear of an appearance of a conflict.</p>
        <p>The back-and-forth over money matters came as a New York Times/CBS News poll showed that most voters are thinking less about candidates' detailed fiscal calculations than about how nice they seem. Mr. Bush was favored over Mr. Gore in the new poll by 47 percent to 39 percent, and although more respondents liked Mr. Gore's stands on the issues, they liked Mr. Bush even more as a person.</p>
