        <p>That's because Mr. Bourdain has emerged as a literary chef, as appreciated for quips as for steak frites, a kind of Clifford Odets with a mandoline.

        <p>SCREAMING orders (''Calamari followed by filet poivre! Am I waiting for a frisee?'') to his coterie of beloved line cooks at Les Halles as he neared the end of his 13-hour day at 9 p.m. on Thursday, Anthony Bourdain was interrupted from his work by diners darting in to shake his calloused hand.</p>
        <p>That's because Mr. Bourdain has emerged as a literary chef, as appreciated for quips as for steak frites, a kind of Clifford Odets with a mandoline. Last year, after nearly three decades of monitoring 30-quart stockpots, searing meat and, too often, his own fingers, Anthony Bourdain decided that the world might want to know how grisly things can get around a Garland stove.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bourdain, who for eight years has been the executive chef at Les Halles on Park Avenue South, sent an unsolicited article about restaurant deceptions to The New Yorker, and to his surprise, the magazine's editor, David Remnick, called Mr. Bourdain at work to let him know it had been accepted. When the article ran, it caught the attention of a book editor at Bloomsbury USA, who persuaded the chef to spin his blustery culinary decrees (''Margarine? That's not food. I can't believe it's not butter? I can.'') into a book.</p>
        <p>The result is ''Kitchen Confidential,'' a 307-page memoir, which has been optioned by David Fincher, who directed the movie ''Fight Club,'' elevating Mr. Bourdain to a celebrity status chefs usually achieve after marketing their sauce lines.</p>
        <p>''Great meal,'' said one man who seemed to stand at about half of Mr. Bourdain's lanky height. ''My wife had the scallops. My sister had the tuna. My other sister had the tuna.'' Mr. Bourdain thanked the diner, though compliments on fish dishes might not flatter a man who presides over a restaurant known for its in-house butcher, and who flushes with animation at the mention of tete du veau, the arcane veal dish he describes as ''mashed up face.''</p>
        <p>''This is heaven tonight,'' Mr. Bourdain said of the restaurant's large but not overwhelming crowd. He was turning out a mere 180 dinners, 70 fewer than the average.</p>
        <p>Even truer heaven for Mr. Bourdain might be an evening when no one asks him to violate one of his creations. An order for onion soup came in with a request to ''torch and nuke it.''</p>
        <p>''People ask us to do some pretty ugly things to the food,'' he said. ''But I don't throw plates anymore. I don't try to make people cry anymore.''</p>
        <p>At 10, Mr. Bourdain left the remainder of the night's duties to his charges. Removing his chef's coat and topping his black acid-wash Levis with a T-shirt and jacket, he walked to Chicama, a Peruvian restaurant about 10 blocks away, where he convenes with other chefs after hours to eat marinated fish.</p>
        <p>''The last thing I want is the kind of food I've been cooking all day,'' he said, somewhere between rants about his hatred of vegetarians (''Vegetarians are the enemy of everything good and decent in the human spirit,'' he writes in his book), the chef Emeril Lagasse and the unseemly concept of brunch.</p>
        <p>At Chicama, Mr. Bourdain received no special treatment. Though no other chefs could join him this evening, he sat down to ceviche negro, sea urchin and mojitos.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bourdain has a contract to write two more nonfiction books, one on Typhoid Mary and the other about a round-the-world odyssey on which he will consume demi-glace-free fare like monkey brains. As much as he relishes the writing life before him, he said, smoking a cigarette at the end of supper, it makes him insecure, as turning out cassoulet every day does not. ''Now,'' he said, I'm wondering: Will people like me? Why hasn't my agent called?''</p>
