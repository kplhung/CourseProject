        <p>IT would have been easy for Neil Barsky and Scott Sipprelle to just join the crowd three months ago.</p>
        <p>The two men run a $120 million hedge fund, the MRG Nucleus fund, from a modest office suite in Midtown Manhattan. They opened MRG Nucleus in July 1998, a few months after striking out from Morgan Stanley, where Mr. Barsky was a well-regarded casino industry analyst and Mr. Sipprelle a top investment banker. By February, 19 months into the fund's life, they found themselves stuck in the middle of the pack in the hotly competitive hedge fund business.</p>
        <p>Hedge funds try to produce above-average investment returns using tactics ranging from traditional stock-picking to complex derivative and arbitrage plays. High minimum investments, redemption restrictions and aggressive strategies make them suitable mainly for more sophisticated and well-heeled investors.</p>
        <p>MRG concentrates on overlooked and undervalued newly public companies, chosen eclectically without a particular sector bias. By ordinary standards, its returns have been solid -- 63.5 percent from inception through February, a 19-month stretch.</p>
        <p>But over the same period, the Nasdaq composite index rose 151 percent. And many hedge funds posted even stronger returns with the help of aggressive leverage and heavy bets on technology -- techniques that Mr. Barsky and Mr. Sipprelle avoided. MRG fell further behind the index  in February, when the Nasdaq rose a scorching 19.2 pecent, triple MRG's gain.</p>
        <p>To be sure, with a return of 42 percent in 1999, MRG was not exactly facing a wave of redemptions from investors angry at missing the technology runup. Still, ''it's always difficult in the investment business to underperform,'' Mr. Sipprelle said.</p>
        <p>So when the two managers sat down to draft their monthly letter to investors after the February results came in, they felt compelled to explain: ''We are not Luddites. We are huge believers in the power of technology to accelerate the efficiency of commerce, the productivity of workers.''</p>
        <p>What they did not believe in, they warned, was the market for technology stocks, which they concluded had gone seriously haywire.</p>
        <p>''We have not drunk from the Kool-Aid that has mesmerized the market into thinking that 'growth at any price' is a sound investment strategy,'' they wrote. ''We are underweight technology today, and expect to remain so as long as valuations stay at current levels. We think the stock market is in the midst of a dangerous game of 'chicken' with tech stocks. We suspect it will end badly; we don't know when.''</p>
        <p>They also spelled out a series of specific concerns, including accelerating price declines in software and hardware, and the explosion in initial public offerings.</p>
        <p>''If there is one verity of the I.P.O. market that has proved itself over the years,'' they wrote, ''it is that when capital becomes too available, a hot sector ends up gorging itself, overinvesting, and ultimately lowering returns for the entire industry.''</p>
        <p>Eleven weeks later, they look smart. The Nasdaq has fallen almost a third from its early March high, but MRG is up 15 percent since then.  Mr. Barsky and Mr. Sipprelle say they try not to gloat, but they acknowledge feeling pretty good. ''If you're building a long-term business, you have to weigh the easy money against the responsibility you have not to take outsize risk,'' Mr. Barsky said.</p>
        <p>WHAT is MRG bullish on now? The fund is still staying away from high-growth technology stocks, which mostly remain expensive by traditional valuation measures even after their tumble over the last two months. Instead, the managers prefer small-capitalization companies that offer relatively strong growth on the cheap.</p>
        <p>Consider Argosy Gaming, which runs midsize riverboat casinos and hotels across the Midwest and South. Drawing on his years as an analyst, Mr. Barsky keeps a close eye on the casino industry, which fell into a painful slump from 1996 to late 1998 before turning around last year. He expects the gains to continue, at least for smaller operators like Argosy.</p>
        <p>Several macroeconomic trends are combining to invigorate the industry, Mr. Barsky said. The long economic boom has given adults more disposable income for gambling. It has also put local government finances into surplus, making states where gambling remains illegal less inclined to legalize it. With capacity constrained and demand rising, companies that do have licenses are seeing profits rise.</p>
        <p>In addition, many states where Argosy has boats have recently relaxed regulations on their operation, allowing the company to cut costs and increase profits. Illinois, for example, dropped a rule that boats must  actually cruise the rivers on which they float, rather than remain permanently docked.</p>
        <p>Factoring out a one-time charge related to a debt financing, Argosy's net income soared from $5.7 million, or 23 cents a share, in 1998 to $41.7 million, or $1.44 a share, in 1999. Revenues grew from $507 million to $595 million.</p>
        <p>Analysts expect continued growth this year and are now forecasting earnings of $1.73 a share, an estimate that has been rising recently. Yet Argosy closed on Friday at $16.50, less than 10 times expected 2000 earnings and barely five times the company's cash flow.</p>
        <p>Argosy ''is so cheap it's not even funny,'' said Mr. Barsky, who called the multiples ''inexplicably low.''</p>
        <p>AT these prices, Argosy could be takeover bait for larger casino operators like MGM Grand or the Mandalay Resort Group, which now focus mainly on the Las Vegas Strip. The spread of Native American-owned casinos in California threatens companies with big investments in Las Vegas, making them ''feel some need to diversify,'' Mr. Barsky said.</p>
        <p>He thinks Argosy, which has accumulated a large database of gambler-customers and is among the strongest of the midsize riverboat operators, makes an inviting target.</p>
