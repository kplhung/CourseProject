        <p>PARKS, golf courses and beaches have two qualities in common.</p>
        <p>Looking at them is relaxing, and maintaining them so that people will want to look at them requires long hours, dedication and specialized equipment. The maintenance experts at three beautiful Connecticut recreation sites know this all too well.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Park</p>
        <p>Nine city workers and at least 150 volunteers maintain the pastoral scene at Elizabeth Park in Hartford, the only public botanical garden in Connecticut. This 102-acre city park is the former Charles Pond estate, named for his wife in the late 1800's.</p>
        <p>Visitors stroll through two and a half acres of roses, a tulip and annual garden, perennial beds, a rock garden and two herb gardens. All of this requires constant grooming by the workers and volunteers.</p>
        <p>The pastel beauty of the rose garden consists of 15,000 bushes of 800 to 900 varieties. Donna Fuss, the rosarian, invites anyone to count them, as she has often in her job tending the garden for the Friends of Elizabeth Park. The Friends formed in 1977 by some members of the Federated Garden Clubs of Connecticut at a time when the city, running out of money, was about to raze some of the gardens.</p>
        <p>Resources are not lavish even with the Friends to help. Mrs. Fuss said she quickly uses her yearly rose bush replacement budget of $8,000, which comes from donations.</p>
        <p>The rest of the plants in Elizabeth Park come from the park's labyrinth of greenhouses, where Robert Prill, the park's maintenance supervisor, grows 25,000 seedlings (of 50 plant varieties) each year. The plants from the greenhouses also go to other city gardens, such as those around City Hall.</p>
        <p>Each week, year-round, Mr. Prill and his staff mix at least four bags of peat moss and pearlite into four wheelbarrow loads of topsoil and two wheelbarrow loads of sand to make a starting mix. There is no time of year when they are not nurturing some little thing in the greenhouses.</p>
        <p>Around the gardens are the grass. The staff uses two specialized mowers that can weave around plants. They also own about a half-dozen regular push mowers and two riding mowers. Most parts of the park get mowed once a week which means something is being mowed almost daily.</p>
        <p>''It's like a maze out there and you have to have a certain kind of machine that can make the turns without taking out the bushes or the flowers,'' Mr. Prill said.</p>
        <p>Hammonasset Beach State Park</p>
        <p>Six workers and a supervisor sweat over a fleet of heavy machinery to tame the 940 acres that make up this state park in Madison. One person spends four hours a day, from Memorial Day to Labor Day, just raking the beach. The worker rides a tractor dragging metal fingers along the two miles of sandy waterfront. The rake is attached to a conveyer that pulls in everything in its path -- cigarette butts, cans, diapers, old forks and the like.</p>
        <p>But the tractor can't handle some of the bigger junk that ends up here. Once the workers found about 50 tires had washed up during the night, said Lori Quirk, the maintenance supervisor. It is common in the early spring to find tree trunks that floated down the Connecticut River and then washed west to the park. This spring they had to dispose of a dead beaver.</p>
        <p>Once summer comes, another laborer does nothing but mow all day, five days a week. The job involves driving a tractor with three 7-foot-wide mowing arms that can be lifted up and down as the need arises. The behemoth whirs its way over 400 acres of fields where people set up tents, play ball, or otherwise romp.</p>
        <p>Workers also prune bushes and trees. A real struggle for them in recent years is to try to get rid of non-native plants, like autumn olive and Oriental bittersweet, that are choking trees and native plants. The problem is worse in the last few years, Ms. Quirk said, possibly because the maintenance crews were smaller for several years  and had less time to cut back the weeds.</p>
        <p>She said the addition of two workers this year has improved the situation but the crew still is not as large as it was in the late 1980's. The park's 1.5 million visitors need to park their cars, drink water and use restrooms, and the maintenance crew must deal with those problems, too. They repair walls and plumbing in 22 bathhouses, maintain the boardwalks and make improvements in the parking lots. This spring a new layer of gravel will fill in ruts in one of the dirt lots.</p>
        <p>While most of the work runs on a predictable schedule, nature brings surprises. One year the winter storms left the parks water main exposed along the beach. The crew had to repair damage to the pipe, but the state does not truck in sand here. Luckily, later storms covered it over again.</p>
        <p>Clinton Country Club</p>
        <p>Inside a brand-new 3,000-square-foot maintenance building sits the fleet of mowing equipment that keeps this private golf course looking so beautiful. Each spring the pressure is on to get the fairways, greens and even the rough in shape for more than 300 members who play on the par-72 course.</p>
        <p>They must like this 100-acre, 18-hole course and driving range, which are on an otherwise wooded road in the waterfront town of Clinton. People who want to join are put on a waiting list. Right now it takes 10 years to get off it. From early April to mid-May, Michael Decker, the superintendent, and staff of three full-timers and three seasonal workers, are deep into the rush to get things ready. Mr. Decker has a $500,000 budget to pay workers and buy supplies and equipment. He also is linked to a weather satellite that reports conditions every 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Decker said the economy is so good right now that it is hard to attract young people to work at the course in the summer. This year workers planted new trees near the entrance, placed sod on a new driving range and began the season's relentless schedule of mowing the grass to the exacting lengths designed to enhance the game.</p>
        <p>Three times a week, workers ride the fairway mowers to clip the grass to nine-sixteenths of an inch. Why nine-sixteenths of an inch? That is the length that works best here, he said. (Some courses cut to a half-inch.) A four-foot-wide swath between the fairways and the rough gets clipped to 1 1/2 inches.</p>
        <p>Two days a week, another worker rides the articulator, a mower that can go over bumps to mow the rough to a woolly 2 inches deep -- long enough to be a challenge, short enough so the golfers can see the balls. The rough used to be 3 inches deep, but people couldn't find their golf balls, Mr. Decker said.</p>
        <p>The club owns two spraying machines. Workers ride on these to dispense anything water-soluble, including grub killers, fungicides and growth regulators. Mr. Decker said he keeps such applications to a minimum because no one likes to be around chemicals, least of all the workers. The grass is well established and requires very little insecticide, he said.</p>
        <p>Then there are the two specialized riding mowers that cut and roll the greens. Every day a worker trims the greens to one-eighth of an inch. Every other day, the grass around the tees is trimmed to same length. The machine's rollers press down the blades to a smooth, faster surface. Mr. Decker said people occasionally ask him if its imitation grass.</p>
        <p>The maintenance crew also has to rake the bunkers, or sand traps. This year they made a new bunker at the second hole. The old one was so deep that golfers were having too hard a time getting out of it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Decker said few people realize the amount of care and attention that goes into caring for a golf course. His main concern is the grass itself, which he describes as a never-ending battle. He combines two varieties of grass, one a native variety of bluegrass that is robust and another, known as bent grass, that is softer and does not sprout seed heads the way the bluegrass does.</p>
        <p>The way he handles it at Clinton is by constantly overseeding with the softer variety of grass. Periodically the crew rolls an aerator over the grass and inserts new grass seed in the holes.</p>
