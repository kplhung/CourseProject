      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Nassau County on Long Island is one of the nation's wealthiest counties -- and also one of its most poorly governed. Years of irresponsible budget policies have brought it to the edge of bankruptcy. Earlier this month, Gov. George Pataki realized that allowing the county to sink into bankruptcy could damage the whole state's credit rating and undermine his own political standing. His proposal for an infusion of state money and a state financing agency to oversee the county is reminiscent of what Gov. Hugh Carey did for New York City in the 1970's. It was a welcome first step, but Mr. Pataki will have to step in more forcefully to help the county make extremely tough budget decisions in the future.</p>
        <p>Like New York City's fiscal crisis of a generation ago, Nassau County's situation has resulted from the elected leaders' habit of piling up debt, rather than forcing taxpayers to foot the bill for their patronage-laden government. The Nassau County Republican organization prospered by handing out generous labor packages and patronage contracts, making it the envy of party leaders, governors and presidents. Last November, realizing that the cost of this system might force service cutbacks and tax increases, Nassau's voters revolted and elected the first Democratic legislature in modern history. Since then, Republicans and Democrats have been squabbling and barely nibbling at the edges of their problem.</p>

        <p>Nassau County on Long Island is one of the nation's wealthiest counties -- and also one of its most poorly governed. Years of irresponsible budget policies have brought it to the edge of bankruptcy. Earlier this month, Gov. George Pataki realized that allowing the county to sink into bankruptcy could damage the whole state's credit rating and undermine his own political standing. His proposal for an infusion of state money and a state financing agency to oversee the county is reminiscent of what Gov. Hugh Carey did for New York City in the 1970's. It was a welcome first step, but Mr. Pataki will have to step in more forcefully to help the county make extremely tough budget decisions in the future.</p>
        <p>Like New York City's fiscal crisis of a generation ago, Nassau County's situation has resulted from the elected leaders' habit of piling up debt, rather than forcing taxpayers to foot the bill for their patronage-laden government. The Nassau County Republican organization prospered by handing out generous labor packages and patronage contracts, making it the envy of party leaders, governors and presidents. Last November, realizing that the cost of this system might force service cutbacks and tax increases, Nassau's voters revolted and elected the first Democratic legislature in modern history. Since then, Republicans and Democrats have been squabbling and barely nibbling at the edges of their problem.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki appointed Frank Zarb, chairman of the group that runs Nasdaq, to make an independent review. He concluded that the county will need at least four years of stringent fiscal policies to reduce its budget deficit. Mr. Pataki's proposal of an oversight agency to issue debt and superintend budget savings could be taken up this week in the county legislature and later by the State Legislature in Albany. Democrats are supporting it in order to ensure that the governor bears some of the political heat for administering the bitter medicine. However, the governor, who would dominate the panel with his own appointees, should modify the plan to include participation by State Comptroller Carl McCall, a Democrat. Mr. McCall has been calling for reform in Nassau County for years and has an intimate knowledge of its finances.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki's proposal would provide $100 million over five years to help the county out of its budget mess and require the county to present a plan to balance its budget in four years. Fiscal experts agree there is no way to achieve that goal without service cutbacks, major sacrifices by unions in the form of layoffs or givebacks on their contracts, a drastic cutback in other contracts that have been the patronage lifeblood of both parties, and very likely a tax increase of some kind, despite Governor Pataki's assertions that no tax increase will be necessary. In the process, the county has to thoroughly revamp its property tax system, which is riddled with unfairness and is costing $100 million each year in tax rebates.</p>
        <p>The lesson of bankruptcy crises in New York City, Yonkers and Troy over the years is that tough steps must be negotiated in a spirit of shared sacrifice. Mr. Pataki is right to demand that the squabbling elected leaders in Nassau County try to come up with their own plans. But he may be naive to think they can avoid the need for him to intervene more firmly. New Yorkers throughout the state will understandably bridle at financial aid for such a rich county. But they may be willing to help if they see that the county is willing to change its ways.</p>
