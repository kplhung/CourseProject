        <p>SOUND loves to revel in a summer night,'' said Edgar Allan Poe, though he was probably not thinking about the New York Philharmonic, which will give a free concert in Westchester this summer.</p>
        <p>Al fresco performances, of course, are adventures unto themselves. You may have to establish an early beachhead to guarantee prime blanket space, and there's always the possibility that the rains won't stay in Spain, while the amplification may (all right, make that will) leave something to be desired. For the past 20 years, the county's Parks, Recreation and Conservation Department has been presenting a summer concert by the New York Philharmonic; this year's performance is set for 8 p.m. Aug. 5 at Westchester Community College in Valhalla.</p>
        <p>Mikko Franck, the Finnish conductor, will lead Bernstein's ''Candide'' Overture, Gershwin's ''American in Paris,'' the Arutunian Trumpet Concerto (with Philip Smith stepping forward from his first chair into the solo spotlight) and Stravinsky's ''Firebird'' Suite. (The same program will be presented on Aug. 3 at  Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx.)</p>
        <p>On summer Sundays, cars yield to bikers and skaters on a segment of the Bronx River Parkway, and at noon this month and next, musical attractions are also part of the scene, with faculty and student artists from the Music Conservatory of Westchester offering informal concerts at Gov. Malcolm Wilson Park on the Parkway Reservation in Yonkers. The Mamaroneck Winds will be blowing today; jazz groups headed by Jimmy Hill and Bob Arthurs are coming June 4 and 11, with the Westchester Be-Bop Delight following on June 18 and the skirls of the Mount Kisco Scottish Pipes and Drums on June 25. (For a list of these and other county offerings, call 242-7275.)</p>
        <p>The United States Military Academy Band kicks off its summer series June 11 at 7:30 P.M. in West Point's Trophy Point Amphitheater. The program includes the world premiere of a piece commissioned for the West Point bicentennial commission, ''Legacy'' by Eric Ewazen. For  directions, call 938-2617.</p>
        <p>Paul Lustig Dunkel, the music director, leads the Westchester Philharmonic in a pops program July 23 at 7 p.m. in Zinsser Park in Hastings-on-Hudson (call 682-3707 for details).</p>
        <p>The Neuberger Museum of Art will be bringing back the Hot Music series it began last summer, with the added attraction of basic dance instructions before each concert.</p>
        <p>Three programs in July, all at 6:30 p.m. on Thursdays, are planned outdoors on the Purchase College campus (with refuge inside the museum in case of rain). On July 13, the group Manana will focus on Son Montuno, a type of salsa music that combines Spanish melody with African rhythms and percussion. On July 20, it's a musical journey to the Caribbean with Steel Passion, a steel drum band based in Tarrytown, and on July 27, the Gerard Carelli Orchestra returns after a popular session last summer. The information number at the Neuberger is 251-6100.</p>
        <p>Looking for more midweek jazz? The Katonah Museum of Art has once again invited some top artists to play al fresco evening concerts, presented with support from Chase Manhattan Bank. For more information on the schedule, which is still in flux, call 232-9555.</p>
        <p>The Metropolitan Opera won't quite make it to Westchester, but it will get close, traveling to two parks in the Bronx. Verdi's ''Rigoletto'' will be presented in concert form on June 16 at 8 p.m. in Pelham Bay Park with Frederick Burchinal taking the title role and Nello Santi conducting. On June 17 at 8 p.m. the Met presents Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly'' in concert at Van Cortlandt Park with the Hungarian soprano Georgina Lukacs in the title role, Paul Charles Clarke as Pinkerton and Julius Rudel conducting. For information, call the Met at (212) 799-3100.</p>
        <p>The Bronx Arts Ensemble is once again offering several free concerts. The annual Fourth of July holiday salute to George M. Cohan (plus Duke Ellington and Irving Berlin) will begin at 2 p.m. in Rockwood Drive Circle at Van Cortlandt Park, followed by a cycle of Sunday events between July 23 and Aug. 20. Big Band Brasses lead the way, to be followed by the Baroque Trumpet, Summer Winds, Nights in Latin America and Italian Opera Favorites. Each program is given twice, outdoors at 2 p.m. in Rockwood Drive Circle (or if it rains, in the Church of the Mediator, Kingsbridge Avenue and West 231st Street), and again at 4 p.m. in McGinley Center at Fordham University. The Ensemble's number is (718) 601-7399.</p>
        <p>Philharmonia Virtuosi brings its popular Sunset Serenade Concerts back to Lasdon Park Arboretum in Somers, with pop and classical events on all five Saturdays in July as well as Aug. 1. Let others worry about rain; Richard Kapp, the music director, tends to fret more about the sun, which can both blind and sizzle his musicians. ''He puts up big, beach-type umbrellas to protect them,'' the conductor's wife, Barbara Kapp, said, ''but aside from often having to move the things after each piece, it makes it difficult for him to see the players -- and worse, for them to see him. They once had to stop in the middle of a performance because an expensive cello was in danger of getting fried, and another time the harpsichord cover got caught up in one of the umbrellas and just hung there. Sometimes, from my vantage point on the lawn, you can't see the players at all: it looks like Dick is conducting a whole orchestra of umbrellas.'' The gates open each evening at 5 for picnicking; the music follows an hour later; for program details, call the Philharmonia offices at 693-5595.</p>
