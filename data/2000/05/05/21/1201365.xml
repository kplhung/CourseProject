      <abstract>
        <p>Federal indictment charges that Eddie Nash, former owner of Hollywood nightclubs, his bodyguard, Gregory DeWitt Diles, and a pornographaic film star, John Curtis Holmes, arranged Wonderland murders of July 1, 1981; Nash, sole surviving defendant, is also charged with running a cocaine and heroin distribution syndicate since 1970's; victims were Ronald Launius, William Deverell, Barbara Richardson and Joy Miller (M)</p>

        <p>Federal prosecutors have reached back to history here to revive a sensational murder case, unveiling an indictment that alleges that a former nightclub owner, his bodyguard and a pornography actor arranged the killings of four people in the Hollywood Hills nearly two decades ago.</p>
        <p>The case sounds like something out of ''L.A. Confidential,'' but it is really more ''Boogie Nights.'' The ''Wonderland murders,'' named after the site, 4763 Wonderland Avenue, where the killings took place on July 1, 1981, proved a potent mix of seamy celebrity, drugs and violence. The killings occurred in an era of notorious Los Angeles criminals, including the Skid Row Slasher, the Hillside Strangler and the Night Stalker.</p>

        <p>Federal prosecutors have reached back to history here to revive a sensational murder case, unveiling an indictment that alleges that a former nightclub owner, his bodyguard and a pornography actor arranged the killings of four people in the Hollywood Hills nearly two decades ago.</p>
        <p>The case sounds like something out of ''L.A. Confidential,'' but it is really more ''Boogie Nights.'' The ''Wonderland murders,'' named after the site, 4763 Wonderland Avenue, where the killings took place on July 1, 1981, proved a potent mix of seamy celebrity, drugs and violence. The killings occurred in an era of notorious Los Angeles criminals, including the Skid Row Slasher, the Hillside Strangler and the Night Stalker.</p>
        <p>''There was dope, porn, sex and drugs and organized crime, and John Holmes and all of these types of things that made it kind of a draw back then,'' said Tom Lange, a retired Los Angeles police detective who investigated the case, and who was later assigned to the O. J. Simpson case. ''Perhaps things are now provable that weren't provable years ago.''</p>
        <p>The wide-ranging racketeering indictment unsealed on Friday accuses Eddie Nash, a former owner of Hollywood nightclubs like the Starwood and the Kit Kat Club whose real name is Adel Gharib Nasrallah, of running a cocaine and heroin distribution syndicate since the 1970's, as well as laundering money, tampering with a juror, and witnesses and tax fraud.</p>
        <p>The authorities say that the case grew out of a separate investigation into an Armenian crime syndicate  and that it led to renewed accusations that Mr. Nash, with his bodyguard, Gregory DeWitt Diles, and a pornographic film star, John Curtis Holmes, carried out the Wonderland murders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nash's lawyer, Fred Rucker, did not return telephone calls. But when Mr. Nash, appearing on a television news program two weeks ago, was asked if he had ordered the killings, he said: ''No, I did not. All I can say is what I've said for the last 20 years. I really did not kill anyone or have anything to do'' with Wonderland. Mr. Holmes died in 1988 of an illness related to AIDS, and Mr. Diles died in 1995. Mr. Nash, 71, was arrested at noon on Friday at his condominium in Tarzana, a suburb northwest of Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The three were tried on slaying charges and ultimately acquitted in state court trials, the last of which was in 1991. The prosecutors say the killings were committed in retaliation for a break-in and drug robbery at Mr. Nash's home two nights earlier, in which he was made to kneel and beg for his life, and Mr. Diles was grazed by a bullet. Two of the suspected robbers, Ronald Launius and William Deverell, lived at the Wonderland residence and were killed there with two women, Barbara Richardson and the owner of the home, Joy Miller. The victims were beaten to death with lengths of pipes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holmes was accused of playing a role in both crimes and being the link between the two camps. Detective Lange said Mr. Holmes was a drug client and associate of Mr. Nash, and left a door unlocked for the robbers to enter Mr. Nash's residence. Mr. Nash was believed to have figured out Mr. Holmes's role, forced him to reveal the robbers' identities and help in the killings. Mr. Holmes, who was staying at the Wonderland residence, was accused of opening the door to let the killers in and participating in the murders.</p>
        <p>Jurors in Mr. Nash's first trial, in 1990, deadlocked 11-1 in favor of conviction; and the federal authorities now say the hold-out juror, a woman who at the time was 18 years old, was paid a bribe on May 15, 1990, by an associate of Mr. Nash.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lange and another investigator, Nils Grevilius, wrote a book about the case, ''Four on the Floor,'' but it has not been published.</p>
