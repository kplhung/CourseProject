        <p>WHEN David M. O'Brien, a government professor at the University of Virginia, took his students on a tour of the Supreme Court recently, they ended up in a private question-and-answer session with a justice who abruptly turned to presidential politics. He blurted out several hot-button issues involving federalism, and said the future composition of the court would dramatically affect the outcome of those cases.</p>
        <p>''Vote carefully,'' the justice, a Republican appointee, implored the students assembled in a stately white oak conference room.</p>
        <p>To this justice, and to interest groups on the left and the right, the 2000 presidential campaign is not so much about whether Al Gore or George W. Bush makes it to the White House. It's about whom Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush would put on the Supreme Court, where vacancies are  likely, if not in the next four years, then certainly in the next president's potential second term. Three of the nine justices are age 70 or older.</p>
        <p>In just about every speech, Mr. Gore warns that religious conservatives like Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell would ratify prospects for the bench in a Bush administration. His advisers were emboldened last week when the court, in a 5-to-4 ruling, overturned parts of the Violence Against Women Act, in a rebuke to Congress's efforts to use interstate commerce rules to preempt state powers. That ruling, they said, would galvanize women who feel they have been left more vulnerable to gender-motivated violence.</p>
        <p>Conservatives are just as determined to make the court a high profile issue. As the Christian Coalition put it in a memorandum to its members, ''The stakes of this first election of the new millennium are extremely high: three Supreme Court judges.''</p>
        <p>While that sounds like hyperbole -- and, indeed, makes for successful fund-raising appeals -- in this case it may be true. The next president's most lasting legacy could be the Supreme Court, which during the next presidential term will probably decide the constitutionality of school choice and late-term abortion.</p>
        <p>Vacancies will be all the more important because the court now is as riven over the major issues of the day as is the House of Representatives across the street. The president also can stock the lower federal courts with judges to his liking.</p>
        <p>Yet for all the breathless warnings on both sides, there is no evidence that voters think about the Supreme Court when they pick a president. The subject is never cited on a list of top concerns of voters, which typically include education and health care. Instead, campaigns have traditionally made the court an issue to help turn out the most loyal Democratic or Republican base voters -- but not to attract independent and swing voters who will decide the election.</p>
        <p>Mocking a reporter's question about the relevance of the Supreme Court in November, Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said, ''The American people are hanging on the 5-4 majority and the federalism issue! In focus groups they talk about it all the time!''</p>
        <p>Mark Mellman, another Democratic pollster, explained, ''We've never seen it being important. Everybody raises it because the political cognoscenti believe it should be important -- and they just can't believe that it's not.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps it is a reach to expect voters to elect a president based on an imponderable: he may or may not appoint new justices, who would then deliberate on issues that have yet-to-be determined.</p>
        <p>Only infrequently, when there is a drama like the nomination of Clarence Thomas in 1991 or the failed nomination of Robert H. Bork in 1987, does the public pay attention. With the most celebrated exceptions of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion, and Brown v. Board of Education, which in 1954 paved the way for school desegregation, it is difficult for people to translate their vote for president into how the Supreme Court might alter their lives.</p>
        <p>''If Bush or Gore says, 'Vote for me because in 2015 Medicare or Social Security will be in better shape,' I don't think that's going to motivate a lot of voters because of the lack of immediacy,'' said Stuart M. Benjamin, a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law who was a clerk for Justice David Souter. ''That, in effect, is what voters are being asked to do with the Supreme Court.''</p>
        <p>RECOGNIZING that the court carries little political weight with most voters -- and perhaps that his views could put off the moderates he will need in November -- Mr. Bush never raises the subject. When asked, he reassures conservatives by suggesting that his nominees would be ''strict constructionists,'' uncomfortable with Roe v. Wade, though he has insisted he would not administer a litmus test to make sure his running mate shares his anti-abortion position.</p>
        <p>Unlike Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore has not been timid about saying he would pick justices who share his pro-choice views.</p>
        <p>Even President Clinton weighed in the other day. ''If they get two to four appointments on the Supreme Court,'' he said, ''I think Roe v. Wade will be repealed and a lot of other things that have been a part of the fabric of our constitutional life will be gone.''</p>
        <p>The hope among Democrats is that they might turn the court into an issue that goes beyond their party base, and draws away moderates who are intrigued by Mr. Bush. There is a possibility for the court to be more at the fore in this campaign because in the next several weeks it is expected to hand down decisions on a series of controversial issues: federalism, partial birth abortion, gays in the Boy Scouts and a challenge to the Miranda warning, which requires police to advise suspects of their rights before beginning an interrogation.</p>
        <p>Ronald A. Klain, a former chief of staff to Mr. Gore and the member of the White House counsel's office who ran the selection process of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, refused to concede that voters will be indifferent to court rulings like the one last week that invalidated a central provision of the Violence Against Women Act.</p>
        <p>''A lot of swing voters in this election are moderate women who care about their lives and their rights,'' Mr. Klain said. ''Whether the Supreme Court thinks that Congress has the power to enact a statute to protect them from hate crimes will be an important issue to them.''</p>
        <p>DETERMINED not to politicize the court, justices have an unspoken rule that they do not retire in an election year (unless of course, mother nature leaves them no choice.) And, if possible, they often try to stay put until the president who can replace them is of the same party as the one who appointed them. It may well be that none of them will budge over the next four years.</p>
        <p>Still, after November, there is the possibility for retirements: Justice John Paul Stevens, 80, is the oldest member of the court; Chief Justice William H.Rehnquist is 75, and Sandra Day O'Connor is 70.</p>
        <p>''Clarence Thomas is good for another 50 years,'' Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said of the youngest justice, who is 51. ''But you've got Rehnquist and Stevens and O'Connor who are along in years.''</p>
        <p>In making the case for the significance of the court as an issue in November, Mr. Specter went so far as to construct a new, highly unlikely, American voting bloc. ''The Supreme Court may be important with the intelligentsia,'' he said. ''But that would be, perhaps, a critical swing vote.''</p>
