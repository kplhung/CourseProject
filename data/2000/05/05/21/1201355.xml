        <p>The list of American League batting leaders is like Old MacDonald's Farm -- here a Rodriguez, there a Rodriguez, everywhere a Rodriguez.</p>
        <p>It is the A-Rod and I-Rod show, and it promises to run all season, maybe even into the postseason voting for most valuable player.

        <p>The list of American League batting leaders is like Old MacDonald's Farm -- here a Rodriguez, there a Rodriguez, everywhere a Rodriguez.</p>
        <p>It is the A-Rod and I-Rod show, and it promises to run all season, maybe even into the postseason voting for most valuable player. Last year the league M.V.P. race produced a close finish between Ivan Rodriguez, the winner, and Pedro Martinez. This year the race could be just as close but three-way, among Ivan Rodriguez, Martinez and Alex Rodriguez.</p>
        <p>''They're both tops,'' Gene Michael, the Yankees' vice president for major league scouting, said of the Rodriguezes. ''They have to be the best two players, certainly among the top four or five players.''</p>
        <p>Johnny Oates, the Texas manager, called the Rodriguezes ''two special people.'' He has managed Ivan for six years and has known Alex for seven years. He marvels not only at how they play baseball, but also at the kind of people they are. Michael marvels at the kind of offense they produce while playing positions where players are not supposed to hit the way they do.</p>
        <p>''They're playing defensive positions,'' said Michael, once a shortstop who hit the way shortstops are supposed to, batting .229 with 15 career home runs. ''You're supposed to have defensive players at those positions. These guys are doing remarkable things.''</p>
        <p>Shortstop, of course, has undergone a transformation. First, Cal Ripken showed that a shortstop could be an offensive player, too, and now Rodriguez is joined by Nomar Garciaparra and Derek Jeter in generating the kind of production once reserved for outfielders and first basemen.</p>
        <p>As the Texas Rangers' catcher, I-Rod last season batted .332, the highest average for an A.L. catcher since Bill Dickey's .362 in 1936, and he hit 35 home runs, a league record for catchers. A-Rod, the Seattle star, last year hit 42 home runs for the second successive season, tying his own A.L. record for shortstops and becoming the only shortstop besides Ernie Banks to hit 40 or more home runs more than once.</p>
        <p>But their 1999 performances were apparently only a prelude to what I-Rod and A-Rod would produce this season.</p>
        <p>Entering yesterday's games, Ivan led the league in slugging percentage (.772), Alex was second (.725); Ivan led in total bases (125), Alex was fourth (103); Ivan was tied for the home run lead (16), Alex was third (13); Alex led in runs scored (45), Ivan was tied for second (37); Alex led in road batting average (.420), Ivan was second (.400); Ivan was second in batting average (.377), Alex was third (.366); Alex was third in runs batted in (43), Ivan was fifth (41).</p>
        <p>Ivan also led the league in extra-base hits (30) and was second in hits (61) and multiple-hit games (19); Alex was first in on-base percentage (.483) and tied for second in walks (34).</p>
        <p>Ivan, who began playing in the major leagues at the age of 19, had progressed steadily as a hitter but leaped to a different level last season after acceding to the Rangers' request and not playing winter ball in Puerto Rico. The Rangers had asked him not to play the previous winter, but he played nevertheless.</p>
        <p>''When I went to Puerto Rico, he was playing winter ball even though we had asked him not to,'' Oates said. ''He asked me to come watch him. I said I can't do that; that would be condoning what you're doing. I said to him, 'Why are you playing?' He looked me in the eye and said, 'Oatesy, I just love to play baseball.' ''</p>
        <p>''He has such a love for the game,'' Oates added, ''he plays it like kids play Little League.''</p>
        <p>Rodriguez also plays it however the manager wants him to.</p>
        <p>''He just adapts to whatever role I ask him to do,'' Oates said. ''I hit him sixth, shared some feelings with him about it, told him he may not get good pitches to hit, but he did what we needed there. I moved him up to second, said I need you to score 100 runs and steal bases. He did that. This spring I said you're going to hit third. That means you can't be running; you have to give Raffy a chance to swing the bat. But you still have to score 100, hit a few home runs and drive in 100. Sure enough, the guy goes out, hits the ball in the seats, drives in runs and he's still scoring runs.''</p>
        <p>Oates said he believed Rodriguez could bat anywhere in the lineup and play anywhere in the field.</p>
        <p>''We've talked about moving him to second base in three or four years,'' the manager said. ''I think he plans to talk to Joe Torre about how it was moving to third. He may go to Bucky Dent's baseball school and work out in the infield. You probably don't want him catching his whole life, but he's so valuable back there right now.''</p>
        <p>The Mariners' Rodriguez has become even more valuable in Seattle with the departure of Ken Griffey Jr. The early returns indicate he is handling his responsibility well.</p>
        <p>''He's dynamite,'' Michael said. ''When he came out of high school, he was already fully developed. He's very strong and keeps getting stronger. He's a better hitter than he was. He struggled for a year or two, then it was gangbusters.''</p>
        <p>Oates, who met Alex Rodriguez when he was a senior in high school, saw him recently when the Mariners played in Texas this month. ''I told him I appreciate watching him play,'' the manager said.</p>
        <p>In that three-game series, Alex rapped seven hits, including two home runs, in 13 at-bats and drove in five runs.</p>
        <p>No-Hit Kids to Closers</p>
        <p>Jose Jimenez might not realize it, but he is following the path of Dave Righetti's pitching career. Righetti pitched a no-hitter for the Yankees in 1983 at the age of 24, then became a relief pitcher and the team's closer the next season. Righetti is the Yankees' career leader in saves with 224. Jimenez pitched a no-hitter for the St. Louis Cardinals last season at the age of 25, and this season he has become the closer for the Colorado Rockies. He has five saves.</p>
        <p>Consistency on the Mound</p>
        <p>The Mets have won all eight of Al Leiter's starts this season, the best such perfect record in the majors through Friday's games. James Baldwin, who had won his first seven starts, was scheduled to start yesterday for the Chicago White Sox. The Arizona Diamondbacks have won all seven of Brian Anderson's starts and have a 22-3 record in games started by Anderson, Randy Johnson and Todd Stottlemyre.</p>
        <p>Bell vs. Belle</p>
        <p>In a stunning development last season, Jay Bell produced greater power numbers than Albert Belle, hitting one more home run, 38 to 37, and generating a higher slugging percentage, .557 to .541. Showing that the outcome was no fluke, the Arizona second baseman again leads the Baltimore right fielder. Going into yesterday's games, Bell had hit seven home runs and had a .520 slugging percentage, while Belle was at five homers and .467.</p>
        <p>Flexible and Flying</p>
        <p>Todd Helton seems as if he singlehandedly plans to replace the offense the Rockies relinquished when they traded Vinny Castilla and Dante Bichette. James Baldwin seems as if he singlehandedly plans to pitch the White Sox into the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Entering yesterday's games, Baldwin had a 6-0 record and Helton was the best hitter in the National League. Helton led the league with a .418 batting average; had the best average with runners in scoring position (.472); had the second-most total bases (111); was second in slugging percentage (.828), runs scored (39) and on-base percentage (.503); was third in runs batted in (41); and was tied for fourth in home runs (13).</p>
        <p>The strong performances of Helton and Baldwin stem from a similar source, the discovery of a flaw in their off-season training.</p>
        <p>''I changed my off-season workout so I wouldn't be tight and inflexible,'' Helton said. ''I felt that was holding me back. My upper body was inflexible and keeping me from hitting as well as I could.''</p>
        <p>Not that the first baseman had been a poor hitter. Last season he batted .320, slugged 35 home runs and drove in 113 runs. But Helton hired a personal trainer and changed his winter routine.</p>
        <p>''I went to more of an Olympic lifting program, gaining strength and flexibility all in one,'' he said. ''It's hard to do. There's a lot of technique to it, which I still really can't do.''</p>
        <p>But Helton began the season with greater flexibility, and his performance serves as an eloquent spokesman for the program he followed.</p>
        <p>Baldwin could join Helton in a joint commercial. He, too, worked with a trainer and changed his workouts.</p>
        <p>''I was getting too big for a pitcher,'' the 28-year-old right-hander said. ''I love to work out with weights. That's nothing that you want because I was losing a lot of flexibility. I thought being a bigger pitcher made a better pitcher, but I found out that it's not necessarily true.''</p>
        <p>As last season progressed, Baldwin, unable to work out as much, found that his body was becoming more flexible. ''They told me I was too big during the first part of the season,'' he said. ''I worked out like a maniac during the off-season, then went to spring training and worked out like a maniac. The next thing you know, yes, I'm strong, yes, I look good, but as far as my performance on the field, it wasn't that good. This makes a big difference.''</p>
        <p>Last season, Baldwin did not gain his sixth victory until Aug. 13; by then he also had 11 losses. He has won 11, 12 or 13 games in each of his previous four seasons. Less than two months into this season, he's halfway toward surpassing those totals.</p>
