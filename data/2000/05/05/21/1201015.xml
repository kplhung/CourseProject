        <p>I often ride my motorcycle without a helmet. Our state helmet law basically applies to motorcycle riders under 18. I figure I'm not putting anyone but myself at risk. My friends say that this is tantamount to suicide. But isn't it just one of many risks all of us take everyday? -- Kelly Krebs, Minneapolis</p>
        <p>If riding without a helmet affected only you, then helmet laws would be intrusive and paternalistic, and you'd be doing nothing unethical by riding bareheaded. An autonomous rider living free of the larger society is an attractive and romantic idea, but like most romantic ideas, it has little correspondence with actual life. Should you get in an accident, you are likely to be more seriously injured than you would be wearing a helmet, and thus you'll consume enormous medical resources. And should you die, your dependents might need a variety of public assistance. In other words, all sorts of social costs will increase, from insurance to emergency services; other people will be paying the price of your riding with the wind. And that is unethical. So I'm afraid that, law or no law, you've got to wear the helmet. However, if you remain determined to feel the wind in your hair, you can ride without your pants, which will not greatly augment your chance of dying, except of embarrassment.</p>

        <p>I am a 17-year-old who is half Hispanic and half Caucasian. I am in no way disadvantaged, but neither are many other blacks and Hispanics. Would it be unethical for me to list my race as Hispanic on college applications?</p>
        <p>-- Anonymous, New York</p>
        <p>Colleges ask about the ethnic backgrounds of their applicants not only because they want to compensate them for presumed disadvantages or the effects of past discrimination, but also out of a belief that it is in the school's interest to assemble a diverse group of students. Remember, the application asks a great deal about you -- your address, your high school, your financial situation -- so the college has a pretty good idea of what hardships you may or may not have overcome.</p>
        <p>If you would like to be particularly scrupulous, you could always write on the form what you've written here -- half Hispanic, half Caucasian. But if the application limits you to marking a single box to denote your ethnic origins, you may check ''Hispanic'' with a clear conscience.</p>
        <p>In planning for a conference, I registered for an evening event for an additional $45. I did not attend this event for personal reasons (which included gorging on cable, something I do not have at home). However, I still put the charge on my expense report. Should I have swallowed the cost myself?</p>
        <p>-- Rebecca Petruck, New York</p>
        <p>Everyone is allowed -- or should be allowed -- a personal day now and then. If you enrolled in this event with every intention of attending, you were right to include it in your expense report, just as you would have had you missed it because you were ill and had taken a sick day. However, each company has its own policy about personal days, and you might want to clarify this with your boss.</p>
        <p>Of course, if what you mean by ''personal reasons'' is a chance to see Mel Gibson naked on cable TV, then you might write to the F.C.C. asking why free network television deprives a hard-working woman like you of this viewing pleasure and thereby deprives her company, and the American economy, of her full attention.</p>
