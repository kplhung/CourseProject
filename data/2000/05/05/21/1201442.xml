        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Harvey Araton (''At Indiana, the Toadies Are Shocked,'' May 16) hits the nail on the head when he notes that Indiana University has been ''held hostage by a basketball coach'' for many years. But this has to be viewed as held hostage by choice. Frankly, the continuing Bobby Knight debacle seems to be an example of the phenomenon whereby hostages sometimes begin to feel sympathetic toward their captors.</p>
        <p>Any reasonably principled university president and board of trustees, none of whom have apparently been in charge at Indiana over the last two-plus decades, would have fired Knight long ago. The so-called impartial investigators have shot an air ball when they say that Knight has displayed a ''pattern of inappropriate behavior.'' This statement comes up way short of the mark. His behavior has been reprehensible and easily worthy of firing.</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Harvey Araton (''At Indiana, the Toadies Are Shocked,'' May 16) hits the nail on the head when he notes that Indiana University has been ''held hostage by a basketball coach'' for many years. But this has to be viewed as held hostage by choice. Frankly, the continuing Bobby Knight debacle seems to be an example of the phenomenon whereby hostages sometimes begin to feel sympathetic toward their captors.</p>
        <p>Any reasonably principled university president and board of trustees, none of whom have apparently been in charge at Indiana over the last two-plus decades, would have fired Knight long ago. The so-called impartial investigators have shot an air ball when they say that Knight has displayed a ''pattern of inappropriate behavior.'' This statement comes up way short of the mark. His behavior has been reprehensible and easily worthy of firing.</p>
        <p>Indiana University's president, Myles Brand, also stated that Knight's ''abusive and embarrassing behavior will not be tolerated.'' In fact, his abusive, bullying, threatening and childlike behavior has sadly been tolerated for decades.</p>
        <p>As for Knight's contrition, everyone is contrite after they are caught and exposed in their misdeeds (see Clinton impeachment inquiry). Finally, to Knight and Brand: Do you know what you are? Yeah, you know.</p>
