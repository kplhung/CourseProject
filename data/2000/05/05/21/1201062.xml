        <p>In March, the Charles O. Hayford State Fish Hatchery, also known as the Hackettstown Hatchery, replaced its old intensive aquaculture building with a new 12,500-square-foot center. The hatchery raises 10 species, 5 of them -- northern pike, walleye, tiger musky, channel catfish and muskellunge -- from eggs indoors. The hatchery's superintendent, Robert Olsen, explained how the new building operates.</p>

        <p>In March, the Charles O. Hayford State Fish Hatchery, also known as the Hackettstown Hatchery, replaced its old intensive aquaculture building with a new 12,500-square-foot center. The hatchery raises 10 species, 5 of them -- northern pike, walleye, tiger musky, channel catfish and muskellunge -- from eggs indoors. The hatchery's superintendent, Robert Olsen, explained how the new building operates.</p>
        <p>Q. You had an intensive aquaculture building before. Why is this one better?</p>
        <p>A. The other one was smaller and not as reliable or energy-efficient. The new intensive culture building gives us the capacity to raise twice as many fish. But its main purpose is to raise fish to a bigger size before we release them, which increases their survivability in the wild. This will increase the number of fish, and the anglers' success rate will go up. The anglers, who basically support the costs of stocking through their license sales and other revenues collected from hunting and fishing equipment, are going to get more pounds for their money.</p>
        <p>Q. Why do fish survive better if they are bigger?</p>
        <p>A. Most fish eat their young if they have the opportunity. They eat fish  that are smaller than they are. With northern pike and muskies, the young will eat each other, if they don't grow at the same rate. They can eat a fish almost their own size.</p>
        <p>Q. How does aquaculture work?</p>
        <p>A. We go out and find fish that are ripe and spawn them. The hatchery personnel strip the eggs from the females and the sperm from the males. It doesn't hurt the fish at all, and we return the fish back to their original waters after we are done spawning them. Then we combine the eggs and sperm and incubate them. We can heat up the water in the building to whatever temperature the fish prefer. Cool-water fish prefer temperatures between 68 to 70  degrees Fahrenheit, and warm-water fish prefer 80 degree temperatures. We also have automatic feeders and automatic timers and we inject oxygen into the water. You can raise a lot of pounds in one tank by keeping the oxygen count up because they aren't stressed. What all this really means is that we can continue to get growth on these species during the wintertime, where if they were outside in the cold, they would be just maintaining.</p>
        <p>Q. How do you strip the eggs from the fish?</p>
        <p>A. We run our hands down their belly and force the eggs out. You can't do it until they are ripe and the eggs are loose. You kind of force them right out the vent and they come flowing out. That's how we do it with the northern pike, walleye, tiger musky and muskellunge. Other species such as the largemouth bass or smallmouth bass we let them spawn naturally out in the ponds and then we go and collect the fry after they hatch and then we reset them up in other ponds. With channel catfish we actually put out 30-gallon barrels and they pair up and they go and lay their eggs in these barrels and then we go in and collect the eggs out of the barrels. It's like a big, gelatinous mass and we bring them inside and incubate them so it's kind of a little different for every species of fish.</p>
        <p>Q. And do you go fishing?</p>
        <p>A. Oh yeah. I love to go fishing. Everybody who goes with me thinks I have the inside on where to go. But I don't know anymore than they do. It's public information. Besides, the fish we put out are not for immediate catch. In other words, if I know the truck is going out and stocking a certain body of water it doesn't mean that much. It's like two to three years down the road before they're big enough to catch.</p>
