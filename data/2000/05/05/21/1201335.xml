        <p>It's a familiar problem for many corporate executives: that one shareholder who turns up at the annual meeting with a loud voice and a scowl and not much patience for the company line.</p>
        <p>Few executives, however, may face the disruption that greeted Paul Lloyd, chairman of R &amp; B Falcon, an oil-drilling contractor, just as its annual meeting was getting under way in Houston last week.</p>
        <p>Unwilling to hold his questions until later, Andre Piazza, 72, a former employee and familiar face at company meetings, pulled what looked like a hand grenade out of his bag and removed the safety pin, the Houston police said.</p>
        <p>As the audience dived for the exits, a company official managed to get hold of the grenade, and Mr. Piazza was arrested. It turned out to be a harmless dummy, so the police charged Mr. Piazza with making a terrorist threat, a misdemeanor. The meeting resumed after 45 minutes.</p>
