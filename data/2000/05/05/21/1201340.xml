        <p>Americans may enjoy watching get-rich-quick game shows and may even buy a lottery ticket or two, but not everyone is dreaming of dollar signs.</p>
        <p>In fact, one-third of the participants in a  survey did not even want to be millionaires, according to AARP and its Modern Maturity magazine, which released the results last week.</p>
        <p>Eighty percent of the 2,366 respondents, questioned mostly by telephone last winter, expressed fears that wealth would turn them into greedy people who considered themselves superior. And three-quarters of those surveyed thought wealth promoted insensitivity to others.</p>
        <p>Earning a lot of money ranked near the bottom when people were asked what made life successful. The top five factors, they said, were strong family relationships, good friends, helping people in need, a good education and an interesting job.</p>
        <p>Still, while some people said chasing wealth was not necessarily a goal, most others would not walk away from a bundle of cash, especially if could be put to good use -- to give to family, friends or charity, for example, or to pay off debt.</p>
        <p>The survey showed that 65 percent of Americans ''would like to give wealth a shot, but they're not particularly interested in acquiring the lifestyles of the rich and famous,'' said Hugh Delehanty, editor of Modern Maturity.</p>
