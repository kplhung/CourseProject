        <p>It seems that you missed the real significance of this story. The fact that Brooke Ellison is a quadriplegic who is graduating from Harvard, and that her story is worthy of coverage, tells us a lot about the general lack of equal opportunity for disabled people in this country.</p>

        <p>Re ''An Unrelenting Drive, and a Harvard Degree'' (front page, May 17):</p>
        <p>It seems that you missed the real significance of this story. The fact that Brooke Ellison is a quadriplegic who is graduating from Harvard, and that her story is worthy of coverage, tells us a lot about the general lack of equal opportunity for disabled people in this country.</p>
        <p>The fact that her mother had to quit work to become her daughter's full-time attendant through high school and college demonstrates the appalling lack of support given to disabled people.</p>
        <p>What if her mother had been unable or unwilling to do so? What would have become of Ms. Ellison then?</p>

        <p>The writer is an assistant professor of history at the University of Iowa.</p>
