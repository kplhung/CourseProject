        <p>THE East End of Long Island is famous for duck, just-picked corn unloaded from burlap sacks and cornucopias of farm-stand vegetables christened by the morning dew.</p>
        <p>As the langorous days of summer proper and then Indian summer dwindle down, backyard chefs and other stay-at-homes who rarely see the inside of a restaurant carry back to the city afterimages of relaxed, inexpensive feasts.</p>
        <p>On the North and South Forks the opportunities for matching local wines with turf dishes at home are limited less by dollars than by imagination. (Surf meals are another story.)</p>
        <p>Professional chefs, who spend their lives as culinary marriage brokers, offer some of the best recommendations around.</p>
        <p>''I hardly ever cook duck at home,'' said Eberhard Muller, the chef and an owner of Lutece in Manhattan. ''But if I did, I would roast the whole bird.'' By home he meant Satur Farms, in Cutchogue on the North Fork, where he and his wife, Paulette Satur, raise 15 acres of vegetables that are sold to restaurants and stores.</p>
        <p>''With duck, I would serve cabernet franc,'' Mr. Muller said. ''Schneider's would be great; they make a fabulous cabernet franc. Or a cabernet sauvignon. I'm torn: the '95 Paumanok or '95 Lenz cabernets, if you can still get them. Or a '97 Lenz. Or '95 or '97 Bedell.</p>
        <p>''With the corn,'' Mr. Muller went on, ''Lenz '97 gewurztraminer, because it's my favorite wine of the moment out there. It would go well with the sweetness of corn, I'd imagine. It goes well with everything.</p>
        <p>''Salads are typically difficult to match with wine. The easiest to match are still off-dry rieslings -- and that's Paumanok.''</p>
        <p>Since its founding in 1973, Ross' North Fork Restaurant, in Southold, has championed Long Island cuisine and wines. More particularly, John Ross, the chef and an owner, said: ''We've emphasized North Fork cuisine. We use everything possible local that we can. I've built my menu around these ingredients.''</p>
        <p>In the restaurant, ''I serve roast duck with plum sauce,'' Mr. Ross said. ''I like merlots with that. Bedell Cellars -- the '95, if you can get it. It was a great vintage. I am sorry to see those merlots go. The '97 is very good, too.</p>
        <p>''Over the last four seasons,'' Mr. Ross continued, ''we have served corn on the cob that is guaranteed three hours from the vine -- not from the stand but from the vine. With corn, I would go with our new viogniers, Macari's and Martha Clara's; Macari's and Hargrave's sauvignon blancs; and stainless-steel chardonnays: Lenz and Corey Creek I like a lot.</p>
        <p>''With veggies, stainless-steel chardonnays are the best choice,'' Mr. Ross concluded. ''That lemony-crisp acidity is refreshing to the mouth. Spring vegetables clash with wine, so you don't want to introduce a lot of flavors. The crisp acidity and cleansing is kind of nice. The vegetables stand up and taste like vegetables.''</p>
        <p>Todd Jacobs offers separate suggestions with duck recipes. As chef and owner, he is consolidating Tierra Mar in Westhampton and Atlantica in West Hampton Beach into one restaurant that will open this month in the Westhampton Bath and Tennis Hotel in West Hampton Beach.</p>
        <p>For ambitious cooks who like canard a l'orange, Mr. Jacobs suggests a cherry brandy and cabernet franc sauce finished with sour cherries, and the same wine in a glass. ''Schneider cabernet franc would be my choice,'' he said. ''It's over the top. Palmer would be second.''</p>
        <p>With smoked duck breast, he would reach  for a pinot noir -- primarily the '97 from Osprey's Dominion, then Jamesport's or Hargrave's -- or Lenz's gewurztraminer, or, from the South Fork, the reserve chardonnay from Wolffer/Sagpond.</p>
        <p>As for corn on the cob, ''white would come to mind,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''I'd like something crisp and light, maybe a sauvignon blanc, to offset the butter and salt. Again, Jamesport; in that category, they do a wonderful job. Also, Paumanok's chenin blanc, a great light summer wine.</p>
        <p>''I'd love to do a salad'' at home, Mr. Jacobs continued. ''I'd go to a farm stand and get what's available. Zucchini, eggplant, tomatoes, scallions. I'd slice them, marinate them with olive oil, add salt and pepper, and grill them. I'd add fresh chopped chives, and then serve them on a bed of greens, with a squeeze of lemon. I'd use Palmer's '98 pinot blanc, a very light wine: For a light meal like that, you don't have overpowering flavors on either side.''</p>
        <p>What about the cost of wine?</p>
        <p>For the budget-conscious, it's elementary that homebodies can drink and eat more thriftily (and often better) than restaurant-goers.</p>
        <p>Consider, for example, a Long Island red wine that retails typically for $15.</p>
        <p>Bought separately in a store, each bottle, with the 8.25 percent sales tax, costs $16.24. A 12-bottle case, with a standard 15 percent discount and the tax, comes to $165.62, or $13.80 a bottle; with an often-found 10 percent discount, to $175.37, or $14.61 a bottle.</p>
        <p>Depending on a restaurant's standard markup, the $15-at-retail bottle can cost, with tax, $32.48 (with a 100 percent markup) to $64.95 (with a 300 percent markup). If a 15 percent tip is applied to the bottle, pre-tax, the costs rise, respectively, to $36.98 or $73.95.</p>
        <p>Outside the restaurant, the savings would rise if you found a merchant who, in addition to holding periodic shelf-clearing knockdown sales, favored his cash-only customers with a supplementary discount, too. Pick up the wine yourself, and you save a possible delivery fee.</p>
        <p>Case purchases of a single wine can be a recipe for boredom. But the arithmetic of stores' mix-and-match cases -- say, three merlots, two cabernet francs, one cabernet sauvignon, one pinot noir, three chardonnays, one sauvignon blanc and one pinot blanc -- can still save you money.</p>
        <p>Remember, too, that magnums -- 1.5 liter bottles, which are twice the size of regular bottles -- sometimes can be found, and almost always cost less than two regular 750-milliliter bottles.</p>
        <p>Moral No. 1: The economics of warm-weather entertainment argue for both careful study of wine ads and catalogs and the cultivation of dependable merchants who are grateful for the repeat business.</p>
        <p>Some excellent New York City retailers deliver wine to Long Island customers, but, the ease aside, there is a benefit in buying from Island merchants, especially those who take big positions in East End wines and enjoy heavy turnovers. The proximity of Suffolk County producers to stores Islandwide ensures frequent deliveries, and, since producers store their inventories carefully in temperature-controlled cellars to avoid spoilage, consumers are likely to get steady flows of fresh goods.</p>
        <p>Moral No. 2: As you fire up the grill for an afternoon or evening of family-and-friends pigging out or socializing -- or if sensibly, you, and not a caterer, have supplied the wine for a wingding under a striped tent -- you can feel good about having pursued a businesslike approach to wine planning and buying that keeps your hard-earned money at home.</p>
