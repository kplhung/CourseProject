        <p>The soldiers who run burundi resent it when outsiders describe the temporary settlements atop the steep green hills that surround the capital of Bujumbura as ''concentration camps.'' Yes, the soldiers concede, the camps are crowded. About 85 percent of the local population, more than 300,000 people, has been moved into them, by force, since September. Yes, conditions are awful: too many wobbly straw huts, too few latrines, too little food. Yes, these camps are only for Hutus and are guarded by Tutsis, the twinned elements in the unstable ethnic atmosphere of central Africa. But the leaders of Burundi's military government prefer to call the strikingly bleak places pictured in these pages ''regroupment'' camps, a phrase that makes them sound almost sensible. And perhaps they are -- if you leave human rights out of the equation.</p>
        <p>For more than six years, rebels from the Hutu majority have been fighting the minority Tutsis, who control Burundi's army and politics. In truth, the civil war predates its official declaration. Here, as in Rwanda to the north, Hutus and Tutsis have killed each other in huge numbers over the last 40 years. The specter of full-scale ethnic slaughter is never far off.</p>
        <p>And so, when Hutu rebels last summer escalated their attacks on the Tutsi enclave of Bujumbura, the nation's Tutsi leaders felt justified in uprooting virtually all the Hutu farmers in the area and herding them into more than 55 makeshift camps. With the Hutu farmers in the camps, the Tutsis claimed, rebels would be deprived of food and shelter. Violence would subside. The camps would prevent a holocaust, the leaders said; surely that greater good outweighed the inconvenience to a few hundred thousand Hutu peasants.</p>
        <p>It may seem curious, but the international community has largely gone along with this exercise in moral relativity. One reason is that the camps seem in fact to have quieted the violence near the capital. Another reason may be that the bar of suffering in Africa is so high that almost anything seems preferable to mass murder -- even inhuman encampments. It was little more than half a decade ago, after all, that at least 500,000 Tutsis were exterminated in Rwanda.</p>
        <p>So almost no one has pressed Burundi too hard. And yet, while the camps may be a short-term strategic success for Burundi's government, it is hard to see how they will in the end calm tensions between Hutus and Tutsis. Cholera, dysentery, malaria and measles are widespread. In a camp called Buhonga, a 20-minute drive from Bujumbura, goats chew grass around a patch of small crosses marking the graves of those who have died since the camp went up, almost overnight, from mounds of mud, straw and banana leaves. Malnourishment, especially for children, is common. Aid workers worry that bean seeds, delivered as relief in big canvas bags, will not be planted but eaten.</p>
        <p>In the camps, Hutu peasants express their ire in the quiet, indirect manner that is characteristic of the region. Gedeon Mpitabavuma, 28, talked impersonally for 15 minutes one recent morning about the conditions in the camp, called Ruyaga, where he lives. He spoke calmly about the lack of food, the prevalence of illness and the discomfort of not knowing how long he must live in the camp.</p>
        <p>Only after he was asked about his family did he mention that his only child, a 2-year-old girl, died of a fever in October, a month after he and his family had moved into the camp. He said he was not permitted to leave the camp to take her to the hospital. ''Of course I blame the government,'' he said with sudden venom. ''I didn't go to that camp by my own choice.''</p>
        <p>A diplomat in Bujumbura told me, ''Burundians can put up with so much suffering and so much misery without doing anything about it.'' Then the diplomat added, ''But once they decide to do something, it's dramatic.''</p>
        <p>One terrifying thing about Burundi is not knowing whether that something dramatic will be good or bad. The installation of Nelson Mandela to lead peace talks has brought about small but promising developments, including the closing of half a dozen camps. (''Please,'' Mandela scolded Burundi's leaders, Hutu and Tutsi alike, at the start of peace talks in January, ''join the modern world.'') Mandela has reminded the Tutsis that they cannot hold on forever. So there is hope.</p>
        <p>But one wonders how much, if the rest of Africa is any model. A few short years of optimism have been plowed over by one conflict after another, in the push for power over the dead states that now litter the continent. Robert Mugabe, a gasping former freedom fighter, seems bent on taking Zimbabwe down with his presidency. In Sierra Leone, rebels have even kidnapped United Nations peacekeepers. Nothing stops the fighting in Congo, Angola or along the border of Ethiopia and Eritrea.</p>
        <p>Even after the horror of Rwanda, genocide remains possible in Burundi, this land of contrasts: of two tribes at war, of hunger in fertile earth, of squalid camps set in lovely countryside. In all, it is much like Africa itself, a gorgeous disgrace.</p>
        <p>''A very beautiful country,'' one Burundian aid worker said near Buhonga as he pointed toward the smoky hills that lead to Lake Tanganyika and across to Congo. ''Very green,'' he said. ''And red.''</p>
