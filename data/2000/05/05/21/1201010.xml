        <p>Jean and Joe Frisenda,  Cold Spring, N.Y.,  March 14, 2000  Jean: ''I was probably crazy running around that day, getting my husband ready for our vacation. We give each other haircuts. When we first met he had his hair somewhat longer. About 20 years ago, we put a perm in his hair. I thought his mother was going to kill us. With me, I always had my hair long. I never trust hairdressers. So the first time my husband cut my hair, I said: 'If you cut too much off, you are cut off. And this is your wife talking. You could be cut off from a lot of things.' Then he listened. I trust him. It's marriage first, hair second. But I trust him with both.''</p>
        <p>Joe: ''I was a hairdresser for 38 years. Now I work for the railroad, but I keep my hands in it. We try different styles. We subscribe to American Hairdresser. I had the curly look at one time, then I had my hair with a part. Lately I'm getting older. You know how Elvis had the top like that with the</p>
        <p>wave? I follow the wave. I go where the wave takes it.''</p>
