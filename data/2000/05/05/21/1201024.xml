        <p>THEY are images as American, and crusty, as apple pie -- cowboys on the prairie, lovers in a small town, dancers in a smoky club -- scenes endlessly romanticized in everything from the detective stories of Dashiell Hammett to the purple prose of ''The Bridges of Madison County.''</p>
        <p>Of late, however, these worn slices of Americana have been given a fresh look by a soft-spoken choreographer and director named Susan Stroman, whose notable talent seems to involve creating lively steps against quintessential American backdrops.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Stroman, a salesman's daughter from Wilmington, Del., it seems only natural that theater might be the medium to shake some dust off those stereotypes.</p>
        <p>''The musical theater, the musical comedy, is inherently American,'' Ms. Stroman said recently. ''And I think Americans, better than anyone, are able to sing and dance and act and do it all. So if you're looking for triple threats, you find them in America.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stroman knows a thing or two about triple threats. With two shows running and another likely for the fall, she is poised to have three productions running simultaneously on Broadway. Ms. Stroman is also represented on film, having choreographed, with Christopher Wheeldon, the current teenage dance movie ''Center Stage,'' directed by Nicholas Hytner.</p>
        <p>Her theater scorecard is especially impressive. First and most famously there is ''Contact,'' at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center, the hit dance musical that Ms. Stroman developed with the writer John Weidman whose centerpiece is a stirring fantasy of redemption set in a mysterious dance hall in Lower Manhattan. Reviewing it in The New York Times, Ben Brantley called Ms. Stroman an ''inspired alchemist'' whose dance was ''the kinetic equivalent to Rodgers and Hart.''</p>
        <p>Her second Broadway show of the season, at the Neil Simon Theater, is the revival of ''The Music Man,'' Meredith Willson's classic story of a con man at work in River City, Iowa. As with ''Contact,'' Ms. Stroman both directed and choreographed ''The Music Man,'' though the reviews for the show were less laudatory.</p>
        <p>And finally, there is ''Oklahoma!,'' the Rodgers and Hammerstein epic, which Ms. Stroman choreographed (to raves) in London in 1998 and which the British impresario Cameron Mackintosh is hoping to bring to Broadway before the year's end.</p>
        <p>Early this month, not surprisingly, Ms. Stroman won four Tony Award nominations, achieving the rare feat of double nominations -- for ''Contact'' and for ''The Music Man'' -- in two categories: best choreography and best direction of a musical.</p>
        <p>For all that, it has been a painful year for Ms. Stroman. In December, her husband and sometime collaborator, the director Mike Ockrent, died after a yearlong fight with leukemia. The pain is still so fresh that Ms. Stroman asked that the subject not be discussed during a recent interview.</p>
        <p>Her only comments spoke loudly enough. ''It's just very emotional,'' she said, her smile breaking. ''I have trouble, actually.'' Her voice trailed off.</p>
        <p>While her friends testify to her grief, part of Ms. Stroman's reluctance to speak about Mr. Ockrent is a reluctance to mix, or confuse, her professional and personal lives. Indeed, those who know her best say her shows were a source of strength during her husband's illness and have been after his death.</p>
        <p>''Work is her savior,'' said the director Scott Ellis, a close friend. ''She is still in a grieving process. But it is work -- she loves work -- that I think saved her through that whole process.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Ms. Stroman has been one of the musical theater's busiest choreographers in recent years. Even as she was leading ''The Music Man'' through its technical rehearsals during the day, she was rehearsing ''Contact'' at night.</p>
        <p>Those who know Stro, as she is familiarly called in theater circles, say she exhibits two elements often in short supply on Broadway: brains and heart. They note that she often writes personal letters to dancers she isn't able to cast, thanking them for auditioning. Those who know her choreography say it is marked by an inordinate care, and is not just acrobatics.</p>
        <p>''Her dances seem so carefully calibrated to tell stories and develop character,'' said Andre Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater. ''The dancers are meant to be human beings, not merely step executors.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stroman agrees. ''Ultimately, you're going to get the best out of an actor if they feel they are creating the part themselves,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Thus for ''Contact,'' Ms. Stroman and her dancers created back stories and names for all the ensemble characters; for ''The Music Man,'' she insisted that the entire cast take trombone lessons.</p>
        <p>''After the second week, I didn't think it was going to work, because there were some really abominable sounds coming out of that room,'' she said with a laugh. ''But by the third week, they were making music.''</p>
        <p>As for ''Contact,'' it did meet with some criticism from an unusual quarter. Shortly after the Tony Administration Committee ruled that it could be considered for the best-musical category, Local 802 of the musicians' union sent a letter of protest arguing that ''Contact'' was not a musical because it lacked an original score, book and live orchestra. (The dancers in the piece perform to prerecorded music.)</p>
        <p>Though Ms. Stroman said she understood the argument, she added that she sees ''Contact'' as part of the musical's continuing evolution toward works with a strong narrative, even if it is dance that is doing the talking.</p>
        <p>''The days when someone could just step in front of the curtain and sing 'Oh, my man, I love him so' and it had nothing to do with the rest of the plot are over,'' she said. ''Audiences want dance and music to propel the plot forward.''</p>
        <p>The musical most often credited with first weaving music and plot together, of course, is the 1943 ''Oklahoma!,'' which Ms. Stroman first encountered as a teenage dance student in Wilmington.</p>
        <p>She began her work on the show itself with the director Trevor Nunn in London in 1998, using many of the same methods she would later employ with ''The Music Man.'' She is an avid researcher and likes to have her routines completely worked out before bringing dancers into the room.</p>
        <p>While ''The Music Man'' and ''Oklahoma!'' are both book-heavy classics and ''Contact'' is a bookless dance play (as its producers described it when it first opened at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center), she approached all three shows with the same basic method.</p>
        <p>''It's finding some sort of theme or some sort of idea of the time that guides the choreography,'' she said. ''And then I'm able to add my own style.''</p>
        <p>For ''Oklahoma!'' the theme was fighting -- for land and for love. For ''The Music Man'' it was breaking out. And for ''Contact'' the theme was, well, making contact.</p>
        <p>''There's a moment when one character reaches out his arm for another,'' Ms. Stroman said. ''And that simple gesture becomes a metaphor for the whole evening.''</p>
        <p>Blond-haired, blue-eyed and slim, Ms. Stroman first came to New York from the University of Delaware in the late 1970's as a dancer, but with full knowledge that she wanted eventually to work as a choreographer. She found some success onstage -- she played a Hungarian murderess in the national tour of ''Chicago'' -- but her first break may have come in a failure.</p>
        <p>The show was ''Musical Chairs,'' an undistinguished little musical whose main claim to fame was the theater in which it played: the Rialto, a former pornographic movie house on West 42nd Street that had gone legit. It was there, however, that Ms. Stroman, who was an actor and assistant choreographer for the show, met Mr. Ellis, who played her boyfriend.</p>
        <p>''She made me look like I could dance,'' Mr. Ellis said.</p>
        <p>The show closed after only 14 performances in 1980, but the two remained friends and began working together on various projects over the years, including a 1987 production of ''Flora, the Red Menace,'' a quirky 1965 Communist-meets-bohemian love story from the composer John Kander and the lyricist Fred Ebb. (A new book was written by David Thompson, who would also become a frequent collaborator.)</p>
        <p>''Flora'' won the attention, and praise, of several major Broadway players, among them the director Harold Prince. It also led Ms. Stroman to several more high-profile jobs as a choreographer, including three productions at the New York City Opera: ''Don Giovanni,''  ''A Little Night Music'' and ''110 in the Shade.''</p>
        <p>In 1990, Ms. Stroman, Mr. Ellis and Mr. Thompson began working in Ms. Stroman's Upper West Side apartment on a project based on the music of Kander and Ebb. The resulting show, ''And the World Goes 'Round,'' became an Off Broadway hit at the Westside Theater, and proved to be Ms. Stroman's entree to Broadway.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stroman would soon choreograph two major Broadway hits, the reconstructed Gershwin musical ''Crazy for You'' in 1992 and Mr. Prince's revival of ''Show Boat'' in 1994, each of which won her a Tony Award. ''Crazy for You'' was especially critical to her life; it was during that show that she met and fell in love with Mr. Ockrent, its director. They were married in 1996.</p>
        <p>Last year, Ms. Stroman was approached by Mr. Bishop, who offered to give her rehearsal time and space to develop an original work for his nonprofit theater. It was a relatively new concept for Ms. Stroman, who had worked almost exclusively in the commercial realm.</p>
        <p>''What was wonderful about being here was it was a very nurturing, very protective environment,'' she said, sitting in the bunkerlike basement rehearsal hall at Lincoln Center Theater. ''They left me alone down here for about five weeks and then came down to see what I was doing. It was like being in a French prison somewhere.''</p>
        <p>What she was doing was ''Contact,'' a piece that would open to raves at the Newhouse in October and subsequently move upstairs to the larger Beaumont.</p>
        <p>It was a remarkable process, Ms. Stroman said, one that allowed her to entertain and experiment with all sorts of images: lovers on a swing, a lonely woman's flight of fancy or a dancing waiter, all played out to recorded rock, bebop and classical music.</p>
        <p>The image that sticks in the mind most forcefully, though, is a pas de deux in the piece's finale, with the actor Boyd Gaines as a suicidal klutz and Deborah Yates as a graceful woman in a yellow dress.</p>
        <p>It is a scene that Ms. Stroman admittedly loves. ''People fall in love when they dance with each other, or at least they used to,'' she said softly. ''It's being in someone's arms. And it used to be an excuse to fall in love.''</p>
