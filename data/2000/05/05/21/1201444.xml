        <p>Bobby Knight chokes one of his players and winds up with a three-game suspension for the next season and a $30,000 fine. Latrell Sprewell does the same thing to a coach and is suspended for a year from the N.B.A., thereby losing $6 million to $7 million in salary.</p>

        <p>To The Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Bobby Knight chokes one of his players and winds up with a three-game suspension for the next season and a $30,000 fine. Latrell Sprewell does the same thing to a coach and is suspended for a year from the N.B.A., thereby losing $6 million to $7 million in salary.</p>
        <p>A member of Indiana's current team, who suggesting that his coach's transgressions would soon be forgotten were the team to win a national title, a belief shared by many Knight supporters, does a disservice to those critical of Knight. They were concerned with the serious inappropriateness of his conduct over the years, and not whether he could continue to produce championship teams.</p>
