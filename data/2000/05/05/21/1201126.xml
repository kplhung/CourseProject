        <p>A GOOD carpet should never rest directly on the floor but on a pad. The pad can add extra cushioning to the carpet and provide a softer walking surface. In addition, the pad insulates the carpet from the hard floor and thus prevents the carpet fibers from being crushed whenever someone walks on it. This can add to the life of the carpet.</p>
        <p>Carpet pads can be divided into two broad categories: attached and unattached. The attached pad is bonded to the back of the carpet at the factory. It is usually made of an inexpensive foam material that quickly loses its resiliency. It is cheap and easy to install, but it deteriorates in a short time.</p>

        <p>A GOOD carpet should never rest directly on the floor but on a pad. The pad can add extra cushioning to the carpet and provide a softer walking surface. In addition, the pad insulates the carpet from the hard floor and thus prevents the carpet fibers from being crushed whenever someone walks on it. This can add to the life of the carpet.</p>
        <p>Carpet pads can be divided into two broad categories: attached and unattached. The attached pad is bonded to the back of the carpet at the factory. It is usually made of an inexpensive foam material that quickly loses its resiliency. It is cheap and easy to install, but it deteriorates in a short time.</p>
        <p>It is far better to invest in an unattached pad. Unattached pads are available in a variety of materials, thicknesses and prices, so you can choose the best product for your carpet. Pads are available in either natural or synthetic materials.</p>
        <p>The natural materials include hair, jute, cotton and rubber. Hair pads are made from horsehair. They are quite durable, but they are also expensive, so most natural fiber pads are a combination of hair, jute and possibly cotton. Unfortunately, these amalgams weaken the pad, causing it to break down over time. In an effort to prevent deterioration, manufacturers coat both sides of the pad with a layer of latex.</p>
        <p>Natural fiber pads tend to be firm, and they do not create a cushioned effect the way the more popular artificial sponge pads do. Sometimes, however, this can be an advantage, especially with woven carpets. Many woven carpets have stiff backs that cannot be fully stretched during installation. If these carpets are placed over a soft pad, they will bend, stretch and wrinkle.</p>
        <p>Rubber pads are a good compromise between the firm fiber pads and soft ones of synthetic materials. They are made in a firm sponge composition or in a softer ''waffle'' design. Sponge rubber pads are available in quarter-inch- and three-eighths-inch thicknesses. Waffle pads are thicker, a half inch or more, but much of that thickness consists of air pockets.</p>
        <p>All rubber pads have some ingredients that affect their quality and durability. One common element is clay. The clay gives the rubber more body, but as it dries out over time, the pad will deteriorate. Unfortunately, there is no way to tell how much clay is in any pad. The best the consumer can hope for is a warranty from the dealer stating that the pad will last as long as the carpet.</p>
        <p>Generally, natural pads are rated according to the number of ounces per cubic yard they weigh. A good quality fiber pad should weigh about 40 ounces, a sponge rubber pad about 64 ounces and a rubber waffle pad around 80 ounces.</p>
        <p>Artificial pads are made from polyurethane foam and are less expensive than natural pads. Artificial pads are called either prime or rebonded, depending on the composition of the polyurethane in them. Prime pads are made with urethane of one consistency in varying thicknesses from one-quarter to three-quarters of an inch. Thickness is not as important, however, as density. Dense pads tend to be firmer and more durable than an open pad.</p>
        <p>Rebonded pads are made of polyurethane chunks that have been bonded into a single sheet. These pads are heavier, denser and more durable than prime pads. Rebonded polyurethane pads are the most common type of residential carpet pad.</p>
        <p>While it is tempting to install an extra-thick artificial pad under a carpet to give it a luxurious feel, this can have some drawbacks. The carpet may flex too much, and if it is not well made, the backing and seams may crack. A pad that is too thin, on the other hand, may not provide enough cushioning and cause the carpet to wear prematurely. It is best then to choose a pad three-quarters of an inch a a half-inch thick with a density of six pounds per cubic foot.</p>
        <p>Even the best carpet will bubble or wrinkle if not installed properly. Wall-to-wall carpet should be stretched with power stretchers. If  not, it will eventually expand on its own and create an unsightly surface that will wear quickly and become a tripping hazard.</p>
        <p>The stretched carpet should be secured with tack strips that are nailed in place one-half inch away from the baseboard around the perimeter of the room. The gap between the tack strip and the baseboard allows clearance to tuck the edges of carpet down and hide any irregularities.</p>
        <p>Not all carpets are wide enough to cover a large room. Often, sections have to be joined with seam tape. All seams should be positioned in low-traffic areas away from direct sunlight. It is important that the pile in both sections of the carpet run the same way or the seam will be obvious.</p>
