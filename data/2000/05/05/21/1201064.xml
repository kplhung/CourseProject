        <p>Q We elected new directors at our recent annual meeting. Immediately after the election I asked for the count of votes. As president, it seemed to be within my authority to have access to that information.  However, the reply was that it was enough for me to know who was elected and for what terms. There is apparently a feeling that to post vote counts would be embarrassing to some candidates. My intention was not to publicize the results to anyone not asking. Do stockholders have a right to the actual vote count of an election for directors? Does anyone, including our managing agent or lawyer, have the right to withhold such information? . . . Victor Stuhl, Corona, Queens.</p>
        <p>A Felix Nihamin, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that the law governing voting at shareholders meetings is in Section 611 of the New York Business Corporation Law. He said that the law requires inspectors of elections to ''count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, determine the result, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election with fairness to all shareholders.''</p>

        <p>Q We elected new directors at our recent annual meeting. Immediately after the election I asked for the count of votes. As president, it seemed to be within my authority to have access to that information.  However, the reply was that it was enough for me to know who was elected and for what terms. There is apparently a feeling that to post vote counts would be embarrassing to some candidates. My intention was not to publicize the results to anyone not asking. Do stockholders have a right to the actual vote count of an election for directors? Does anyone, including our managing agent or lawyer, have the right to withhold such information? . . . Victor Stuhl, Corona, Queens.</p>
        <p>A Felix Nihamin, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that the law governing voting at shareholders meetings is in Section 611 of the New York Business Corporation Law. He said that the law requires inspectors of elections to ''count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, determine the result, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election with fairness to all shareholders.''</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Nihamin said, the law provides that ''upon the request of the person presiding at the meeting or any shareholder entitled to vote thereat, the inspectors shall make a report in writing of any challenge, question or matter determined by them and execute a certificate of any fact found by them.''</p>
        <p>Accordingly, Mr. Nihamin said, while the inspectors are clearly required to ''determine the result'' of an election of board members, there is no specific language in the law that requires them to provide the actual vote counts.</p>
        <p>At the same time, he said, it is possible that the requirement that inspectors ''execute a certificate of any fact found by them'' could be interpreted as implicitly requiring an exact vote count if one is demanded by the person presiding over the meeting or a shareholder who was entitled to vote.</p>
        <p>''My experience, however, has been that inspector certifications usually limit themselves to verifying the election results rather than the actual vote count,'' Mr. Nihamin said. Nevertheless, he said, if a request for an exact vote count has been made by someone entitled to make such a request, and the request is denied, that person could begin an action in Supreme Court seeking a court order compelling the release of the information.</p>
        <p>Replacing A Door Latch</p>
        <p>Q The doors to my apartment building must be opened with a key when entering from the outside. When exiting from the inside, however, there used to be a door handle that could be used to open the door with one hand.  Now, however, that handle has been replaced with a door latch that requires two hands to operate: one to open the latch and the other to pull the door open. The door is very heavy and the new latch handle has very sharp edges. A number of people in the building who have young children in strollers -- as well as people who use walkers, canes and crutches -- are finding it impossible to open the door while holding onto their strollers, walkers, canes or crutches. I've approached the building manager about this, but he refuses to take into account the needs of his tenants.  What can be done to have the situation changed? . . . Sally Greenberg, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the New York City Department of Buildings, said that while current law would require new buildings to be constructed in such a manner as to provide access for the disabled -- including making it possible for a person to open an entry door with one hand -- that law would generally apply only to buildings built after the passage of Local Law 58 in 1987.</p>
        <p>And while there might be situations in which buildings built before that time could be required to have accessible doors installed -- such as when the entire entryway was being replaced -- the mere replacement of the latching mechanism would generally not result in the owner having to comply with the stricter codes.</p>
