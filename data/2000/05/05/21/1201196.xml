        <p>SUMMERTIME, and the living is easy. At least it will be for the 75,000 guests expected at the Montauk Yacht Club Resort and Marina.</p>
        <p>But for the 160 employees, whose season runs from March to November, there is little time to relax when there are paintings to hang, pillows to fluff, tennis balls to replace and decks to waterproof.</p>
        <p>For nearly four decades, the 22-acre club has been a playground for the rich and famous of the South Fork. The original membership was a Who's Who of power brokers, including J. P. Morgan, Nelson Doubleday, Edsel Ford and Harold S. Vanderbilt. With a clientele history like that, attention to details becomes paramount.</p>
        <p>As the general manager, Gary Wood is in charge of those details. He came on board in January when the resort's owners, Oaktree Capital, hired new management, the Hostmark Hospitality Group of Illinois. That gave him several months to get things under control for the unofficial opening on Memorial Day.</p>
        <p>Before waves of customers arrive, Mr. Wood, a 40-year-old Eastport resident, must prepare the 84 guest rooms in the central resort area and the 23 rooms in the waterfront villas. Before the peak season, rooms cost an average of $89 a day, with the price rising to the mid-$200's in the high season. The best waterfront room goes for $369 during the Labor Day weekend. Customers paying these prices expect perfection.</p>
        <p>''We have to inspect each of the 107 rooms, one at a time, from floor to ceiling,'' said Mr. Wood, who conducts the survey with Chuck Morton, chief engineer, and Chris Fiorentino, rooms manager. They flush each toilet, check all air conditioners, listen to every radio, test each room's refrigerator.</p>
        <p>It is not just the 107 hairdryers that they worry about. They also have to order all the shampoos, lotions, soaps and bath gels, and then make sure they are presented in appealing baskets. (They will need 100,000 of those items for the season.)</p>
        <p>The room inspection process takes only about a week, which is fortunate for Mr. Wood, because he has to move on to the two restaurants and the bar.</p>
        <p>Preparations at the Lighthouse Grill restaurant, the Lighthouse Bar and the casual waterfront Breeze's Cafe require more than just stocking the ingredients for pina coladas and fresh fruit daiquiris, the most popular drinks. There are new entrees and desserts to be conceived and silverware to be polished.</p>
        <p>Tim East, the food and beverage director, and Paul Roman, executive chef, start planning the menu with Mr. Wood months before the resort opens. To devise this year's menu, which includes more than 200 items, they looked at what was popular last year, researched trends in the food and beverage industry and ''checked out local tastes,'' said Mr. Wood.</p>
        <p>''I am very opinionated when it comes to food and beverage,'' he said, ''so I give the staff a run for their money.''</p>
        <p>Once a menu is proposed, the real work begins. After the chef and his kitchen crew create the dishes, a half-dozen staff members gather for taste tests, rate the presentation and make sure the menu properly describes the dishes.</p>
        <p>One recent taste test brought unexpected results. One dish was Plats du Mer -- clams, oysters, shrimp, mussels, crab and their sauces -- presented at the table as a buffet, large platters filled with crushed ice on wire racks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wood thought the Plats du Mer looked great, but Mr. Wood, who is 5 feet 4, was unable to reach a piece of lobster on the top tier. Mr. East, who is 6 feet 4, had not noticed the problem.</p>
        <p>''So we decided to rework that presentation,'' Mr. Wood said. ''That's something the chef and the food and beverage director would never have thought about.''</p>
        <p>Before the bartenders begin their nightly task of slicing 108 limes, everything that has been locked up and stored must be brought out, dusted off, polished and either replaced or brought up to date. (For starters, the resort has 40,000 pieces of stemware.)</p>
        <p>The hotel, although it has already open for business, is still in a state of preparation. Paintings on loan from the Montauk Artists Association are being hung in the restaurants, guest rooms and public areas. Meetings discuss floral arrangements.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wood does not always use his staff for advice. On some matters, he goes straight to his customers.</p>
        <p>''We try to get decisions of regulars,'' he said, ''inviting them for lunch or dinner to get their feedback on everything from food to the right pricing structure.''</p>
        <p>The gift shop, which stocks hundreds of items, from bags of M&amp;M's to clothing, began ordering in February. To learn what is hot, catalogs are studied and gift shows visited. One item perennially popular item is suntan lotion; the resort sells 15 cases each season.</p>
        <p>Before swimmers arrive, one indoor pool and two others outdoors need to be painted and brought up to the proper temperature. (A week before the pools open, the employees have a chance to test them.) At the fitness center, the four treadmills and scores of other pieces of equipment need to be checked and oiled.</p>
        <p>There are nine tennis courts, including four that are lit for night games, and a tennis camp. The hotel goes through about 1,000 tennis balls a season.</p>
        <p>This year, for a new children's program, Garrett Nagle, the activities director, went on a shopping spree, buying 30 board games, hundreds of crayons and coloring books, videos, a television and a VCR, bats and ''every conceivable kind of ball.''</p>
        <p>Staff must be hired: dockhands (12), lifeguards (8), housekeeping attendants (20), bartenders (6) and bands to perform at Breeze's Cafe. More than 20 audition tapes are screened before a handful of bands are selected.</p>
        <p>Marketing campaigns must be created, and meetings with the resort's advertising company are routine.</p>
        <p>Other details? Payroll needs to be tended to; the resort issues 160 checks a week in peak season. Ten thousand keys are distributed; each guest gets a new electronic key. One hundred gallons of weatherproofing is used to prep the decks, patios, boardwalks and so on. Then there's laundry -- about 500,000 pounds a season.</p>
        <p>There is -- always -- maintenance work on the 232 slips in the marina, which can accommodate boats from 40 feet to yachts over 125 feet.</p>
        <p>There is specific landscaping to be done elsewhere on the property, especially around the hotel's circular drive. One extensive job this year was the trimming of several hundred yards of hedges. ''It was a major deal,'' said Mr. Wood.</p>
        <p>After the blue and white striped canopy for the Breeze's Cafe was raised, 50 sets of 100 little lights needed to be strung. All the decks were painted; for the outdoor cafe deck, sand was added to the blue paint to prevent skids. The wicker chairs were repaired and painted white.</p>
        <p>Every room has an outdoor balcony and many have barrel planters, all of which needed to be replanted. Mr. Wood ordered hundreds of Million Belles and Snowstorms.</p>
        <p>One job still to be undertaken is the hanging of 10 or so flags from the flagpole. By Memorial Day, the Stars and Stripes, plus state and nautical flags, will be fluttering in the East End wind.</p>
        <p>''When all the flags are flying, you know we're officially open,'' Mr. Wood said.</p>
