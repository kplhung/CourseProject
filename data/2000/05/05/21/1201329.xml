        <p>Bloomberg News has caught Morgan Stanley Dean Witter chief strategist Barton Biggs fabricating bullish outlook of his plumber and others he calls 'symbolic characters' as counterpoint to his own bearish outlook on US stocks (M)</p>

        <p>Don't expect Barton Biggs to be offering his market insights on Bloomberg News anytime soon. His plumber, maybe. Nine days ago, Bloomberg caught Mr. Biggs, chief equity strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, making up comments from Ron Valentine, an Idaho plumber who, coming to fix Mr. Biggs's kitchen sink in Sun Valley three years ago, told Mr. Biggs that he was overly bearish. Mr. Biggs has been notoriously downbeat on United States stocks for years.</p>
        <p>Since then, Mr. Biggs and Mr. Valentine have never spoken. But that has not stopped Mr. Biggs from repeatedly offering Mr. Valentine's bullishness as fodder for his own market commentary. In an August 1999 report, Mr. Biggs informed his readers that ''my plumber'' had begun to trade on margin. ''I don't think they think they're real characters. No,'' Mr. Biggs said last week of the plumber and others he mentions. ''They're symbolic characters.''</p>

        <p>Now market watchers might be able to receive Mr. Valentine's analysis directly. Bloomberg has offered Mr. Valentine a spot as a columnist. ''It's unreal that they'd want to do that,'' Mr. Biggs said. No word yet of a decision from the plumber.</p>
