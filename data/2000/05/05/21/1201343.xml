        <p>Hundreds of millions of dollars set aside by the federal government to help provide health insurance to poor people leaving welfare remains unused because states have not claimed the money, a new accounting by the Department of Health and Human Services shows.</p>
        <p>As a result, many people who were pushed off welfare and are eligible for comprehensive health benefits under Medicaid are not getting coverage.</p>
        <p>Congress foresaw the problem in 1996, when it rewrote the nation's welfare laws. It set aside $500 million to ensure that children and their parents would not lose Medicaid coverage when they lost cash assistance.</p>
        <p>But figures from the Department of Health and Human Services show that more than three-fourths of the money -- $383 million -- remains unspent.</p>
        <p>Melissa T. Skolfield, a spokeswoman for the department, said: ''It's free money. We would really like to see states use it.''</p>
        <p>After repeated requests this week, the Department of Health and Human Services provided a tabulation of state spending through Dec. 31, the latest data available. The figures showed that 21 states had spent less than 10 percent of the money they were allocated to help preserve Medicaid for people leaving welfare.</p>
        <p>The department said that Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Nebraska, Tennessee and Texas had not spent any of their money. Connecticut spent less than 1 percent of its $5.8 million allocation, and New Jersey spent all of its $11 million allocation.</p>
        <p>New York spent 10.6 percent of its money and still had $33 million available, the federal government reported. Robert C. Kenny, a spokesman for the New York Health Department, said the state intended to spend the rest of its money, but he could not say when.</p>
        <p>States can use the money for a wide range of activities: to let people know that health insurance is available through Medicaid, to find those who might be eligible and to help them apply; to print brochures and simplify application forms; to fix computer systems used to evaluate eligibility; to hire or train state and local government employees who work on Medicaid and welfare.</p>
        <p>In addition, states can give money, as Michigan has done, to local hospitals, health departments and community groups to find eligible low-income families and to help them enroll.</p>
        <p>The money can also be used to hire interpreters or to translate application forms into Spanish and other languages for people who do not read English.</p>
        <p>Access to Medicaid is important to people leaving welfare because they often take low-wage jobs with no health benefits. Even if an employer offers health insurance, low-wage workers may be unable to afford the premiums.</p>
        <p>Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, said she and other lawmakers, especially Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, ''worked very hard in 1996 to make sure that no child would lose Medicaid coverage as a result of welfare reform.''</p>
        <p>Accordingly, Mrs. Johnson said, ''The collapse in the provision of Medicaid benefits to eligible children has been a significant disappointment.''</p>
        <p>Matt D. Salo, a health policy expert at the National Governors' Association, said the federal government had made it difficult for states to spend the $500 million because it initially defined ''very narrow acceptable uses'' for the money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salo insisted that states were taking ''aggressive actions'' to ensure that eligible families receive Medicaid.</p>
        <p>A recent survey of 21 states by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured found that Medicaid enrollment increased slightly from June 1998 to June 1999, but was still below the level of June 1997.</p>
        <p>Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, said some of the decline had occurred because of ''benign neglect'' by officials in some states.</p>
        <p>Elaborating on this point, Laurie Rubiner, a former aide to Mr. Chafee who worked on the 1996 law, said: ''State officials have their eye on the bottom line. The desire to reduce Medicaid coverage and control costs appears to be a factor contributing to the decline in Medicaid rolls.''</p>
        <p>Jocelyn Guyer, a health care expert at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research and advocacy group, said that ''in most states, more than half of parents and more than one out of three children in families leaving welfare lose Medicaid,'' even though virtually all the children and most of the parents remain eligible for Medicaid.</p>
        <p>Joan C. Alker, a lobbyist at Families USA, a consumer group, said: ''There's clearly a problem here, and states have the money to fix it. In many cases, computer systems kicked families off Medicaid by mistake. Or the rules were so complex that caseworkers did not understand the family's right to receive health care services.''</p>
        <p>Prior to the 1996 welfare law, people who received cash assistance were automatically enrolled in Medicaid. Congress severed the link between the two programs in 1996. States were free to change their welfare eligibility rules, but had to provide Medicaid to any low-income family that would have qualified under the standards in effect in July 1996.</p>
        <p>Congress set aside the $500 million because it anticipated that states would incur new costs, running separate systems to assess eligibility for Medicaid and welfare.</p>
