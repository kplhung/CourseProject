        <p>SUMMER by the sea can be demanding, what with golf games to be worked on, tennis matches to be played, fish to be caught, boats to be sailed, parties to give.</p>
        <p>But in the Hamptons, praying hard goes hand in hand with playing hard.</p>
        <p>''We're the S.R.O., the standing room only congregation,'' said Rabbi Marc Schneier of the Hampton Synagogue, in Westhampton Beach. ''We're competing against the parties and the pools and the beaches and the tennis and the golf, and in the middle of it is a synagogue you can't even get a seat in.''</p>
        <p>Though synagogues and churches elsewhere may be quiet, on the East End religion does not take a vacation. It flourishes. Perhaps it is the area's natural beauty and serenity. Or maybe it is just the break from the Monday to Friday rush.</p>
        <p>''I think people are in a very different mind-set at the beach,'' said Rabbi Schneier, 41. ''People are much more spiritual. It has something to do with the aesthetics. It has something to do with the pace. As soon as I get off Sunrise Highway and head into Westhampton Beach, my whole disposition changes.''</p>
        <p>A decade ago, Rabbi Schneier, an 18th-generation Orthodox rabbi whose main residence is in Manhattan, was going to be summering in Westhampton Beach. He reached out to a few families to put together a minyan, the quorum of 10 men for a prayer service. After the village issued an injunction to try to shut down the gatherings in his home, saying a house of worship could not convene there because of fire laws and building codes, a legal skirmish ensued. Rabbi Schneier prevailed in State Appellate Court and began holding regular services in his home in 1990.</p>
        <p>The Hampton Synagogue, designed to hold 350 worshipers and to be open six months a year, was dedicated in 1994. Six years later, it is open year round and the congregation is in the midst of a three-phase expansion, including a Jewish library and a children's center, day camp and classes for parents and small children up to 2 1/2. About 30 congregants attend Sabbath services during winter, but in summer the sanctuary is so crowded that the doors are left open.</p>
        <p>''We have another 250 people sitting outside,'' said Rabbi Schneier, defining himself as ''the rabbi of an Orthodox synagogue with a Conservative congregation and a Reform membership.'' The rabbi, who is also the president of the North American Board of Rabbis, only takes the pulpit from Passover through the High Holy Days. His assistant, Rabbi Jonathan Feldman, takes over during the winter.</p>
        <p>Dress is informal. And the kiddush, the reception after services, has been called one of the hottest places for Jewish singles to meet on the East End.</p>
        <p>Mass at 9:30, Then On to the Beach</p>
        <p>When Joe and Maureen Titus and their three children moved to East Hampton from Montauk last year, they joined Most Holy Trinity Church. They were not surprised to find the Roman Catholic Church in East Hampton packed every Sunday. The overflow was relegated to a tent on the lawn, listening to Mass over speakers and watching the service on a television screen.</p>
        <p>''There was probably more jockeying for seats at church than at the beach,'' Mr. Titus said, noting that their former parish, St. Teresa's in Montauk, was also overcrowded, due to a shortage of priests and a swelling summer population. ''Religion is a part of your life. Whether you are on vacation or not, you make time for it. It's only an hour. You look at your priorities.''</p>
        <p>To ease the crush at Most Holy Trinity, a new parish hall that seats 600 and doubles as a church and community center opened on Easter Sunday. The church has 1,700 families, the Rev. Donald Desmond said.</p>
        <p>During the winter there are three Masses on Sunday. During the summer, there are Masses at 5:15 p.m. Saturday and 7 a.m. Sunday in the white-shingled church next door, and in the parish hall Sunday morning at 9:30 and 11:30.</p>
        <p>The 9:30 a.m. Mass is the most popular, Father Desmond said, because worshipers have plenty of time to get to the beach.</p>
        <p>''There is a big push for every parish to have a bigger church so they can accommodate all the people,'' Father Desmond said. ''We used to have a Mass every hour on the hour, but the parking, it just got too much. It got too crowded.''</p>
        <p>Weekends Start With Shabbat on the Sand</p>
        <p>For members of the Jewish Center of the Hamptons, a Reform/post-denominational congregation in East Hampton, weekends in the Hamptons begin at the beach. Starting Memorial Day weekend, every Friday evening at 5:30 p.m., 250 congregants gather at Main Beach for a half-hour guitar service welcoming the Sabbath.</p>
        <p>''It evolved from Tot Shabbat to Kid Shabbat to Shabbat on the Beach, for kids and anyone who thinks like a kid,'' said Rabbi David Gelfand, 49, who leads prayers and storytelling while worshipers sit on the sand. ''There are people who come straight out from the city. They leave their jackets and ties in the car.''</p>
        <p>''There is something that happens either as people come through the Midtown tunnel or into the Pine Barrens, when they take the mindset of their suit off and the intensity of the city,'' Rabbi Gelfand said. ''The beauty of the Hamptons fits with a sense of spirituality that is very prevalent in our culture at this time.''</p>
        <p>At 8:30 p.m., late enough for city dwellers to have made their way east, a second Friday evening service is held, this one on Woods Lane, in the wood and glass sanctuary designed by Norman Jaffe. Once again, Rabbi Gelfand draws a packed house. In the last two years, the congregation has grown from 400 to nearly 700 families.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Gelfand said that while some congregants go to synagogue regularly in the city, about two-thirds find themselves in temple more often in the Hamptons, where they have more time on their hands. ''It has become an acceptable thing to do,'' he said. ''It fits with the cultural milieu.''</p>
        <p>He said the congregation had a great desire for knowledge and culture. To quench that thirst, special programs and classes are scheduled during the season, including speakers like Macy Hart, founder of the Institute of Southern Jewry; Norman Cohen, provost of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion and a Midrash scholar, and the cantors billed as ''The 3 Jewish Tenors: Nathan Lam, Alberto Mizrachi and Jackie Mendelsohn.''</p>
        <p>After Saturday morning services, 60 to 70 congregants study the Torah from noon to 1, even on sunny summer days. ''They'll get itchy at 1, but the point is they are still there,'' Rabbi Gelfand said. ''I find it quite fascinating. Why aren't they on the beach at 11? I am politely mystified by it. It's a reflection of the community, why people come here, and of the times of which we live.''</p>
        <p>Every Friday night, year round, Bruce Saber, 41, a Manhattan real estate investor, and his wife, Lisa Sotto, 37, an environmental lawyer, drive out to their East Hampton home with their daughters, Rebecca, 4, and Arielle, 2.</p>
        <p>They have belonged to a temple in the city for five years, but have never attended a service there. But first thing every Saturday morning, they head to temple at the Jewish Center of the Hamptons.</p>
        <p>''Weekends here are still special, because we spend 48 hours with our kids,'' said Mr. Saber, admitting that dressing up to start his hard-earned time off is sometimes irritating.</p>
        <p>''Part of me just wants to sit in the backyard. It's the kids who brought us here,'' he said. ''Rebecca insists on coming. They get excited. The kids are so comfortable here.</p>
        <p>''Saturday services is the ritual now. I don't view this as just religion. Half of it is just a seminal family event each week.''</p>
        <p>Summer Services In a Stucco Chapel</p>
        <p>There are only seven pews on each side of the aisle at St. Peter's Episcopal Church, a tiny summer church in Springs that holds 60 worshipers. Services are held from Memorial Day until a week after Labor Day.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Darwin Price runs the service at the 119-year-old stucco chapel. He also leads the prayers the larger St. Luke's Episcopal Church in East Hampton on Sunday mornings at 8 and 10, drawing 50 parishioners to the first service and 150 to 190 at the second.</p>
        <p>''With the summer crowds and the traffic, I changed it last year to doing it Saturday at 6 p.m. and attendance actually doubled,'' he said of the St. Peter's service. ''It did free people up on Sunday if they wanted to go at the beach and be with family.''</p>
        <p>''The chapel has the sense of a summer camp, windows are open, people are more informal, people are dressed real casual,'' Father Price said. ''In the village, people are more dressed for a traditional service.''</p>
        <p>At 91, Winifred Denton is the oldest member of St. Peter's. She has lived near the church, on Old Stone Highway, her entire life and was the organist there for 10 years. Until 1978, services were held all year. Four generations of her family have attended the church.</p>
        <p>''When I was a child, we had no transportation unless you walked,'' she said, noting that St. Luke's is seven miles away. ''So we went to this little church right here. It's part of me.''</p>
        <p>Her daughter, Jane Maxey, is on the vestry at St. Luke's, but attends St. Peter's in the summer.</p>
        <p>''It's so laid back here,'' Mrs. Maxey said. She and the 14 other women in the church guild prepare a supper after the evening service. ''They like that social time. You can come in your shorts. There is so much more spirituality here versus up the street.''</p>
        <p>But some older congregations do not swell with extra worshipers in summer. David Parker, minister of the First United Methodist Church of East Hampton, said his church picked up few extra people.</p>
        <p>''We wish it were different,'' said Mr. Parker, who usually counts a flock of 40 to 50 for a 10:30 a.m. Sunday service. ''The people who come out, churchgoing seems to be pretty low on their agenda. The beach has more attraction.''</p>
        <p>'Weekends Are a Vital Part Of People's Incomes'</p>
        <p>Dennis Curles, the clerk of session, the leading layman at the First Presbyterian Church of Amagansett, said the church saw an increase in attendance because of the summer people, but lost some of its regulars.</p>
        <p>''We're a tourist-oriented community and the weekends are a vital part of people's incomes,'' Mr. Curles said. ''It's a short season. You have to make your money quick. We compete with the beaches and the boats and the great eastern end of Long Island. We just want to take advantage of the 10 weeks we have. We want to enjoy it. I wouldn't say God goes out the window; he just takes a backseat.''</p>
        <p>The beach is part of the draw at St. Andrew's Dune Church. Once a Coast Guard station, the red-shingled Episcopal church is sandwiched between Lake Agawam and the beach in Southampton. After 11 a.m. Sunday services, one third of the 200-plus worshipers go straight to the beach club next door.</p>
        <p>''In the summertime, this is where people go, this is where the family gets together,'' said Alan McFarland, chairman of the board of the 122-year-old church. Neither heated nor air-conditioned, St. Andrew's opens for the summer on June 18. ''The bad news is, it's not a parish with a congregation. It's just a summer chapel.''</p>
        <p>But attendance has grown in the last 15 years. There are 14 weddings and at least 12 christenings scheduled this summer. A 60-member choir of 7- to 14-year-olds, started in the 1920's, lures churchgoers.</p>
        <p>''Boy, does that bring in the grandmothers and drag fathers off the tennis court,'' Mr. McFarland said. ''It's a great crowd pleaser. It cuts into people's golf and tennis, but if it's one hour, they don't mind too terribly.''</p>
        <p>At St. Andrew's, the men wear neckties and the women are in dresses. But formality ends there. ''I haven't worn socks there in 35 years,'' Mr. McFarland said. ''It's summertime.''</p>
        <p>Part of the attraction at St. Andrew's is a rotating schedule of well-known preachers who pull out their best 20-minute sermons.</p>
        <p>Besides the Rev. Peter M. Larsen of St. John's Episcopal Church in Southampton, who also does the liturgy, preachers due this summer include the Rev. George W. Rutler of St. Agnes Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan, Rabbi Ronald B. Sobel of Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan and the Rev. Ralph R. Warren Jr., who ministers to many who summer in the Hamptons at the Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea in Palm Beach, Fla.</p>
        <p>''A lot of them are worried if they don't go to church, their stocks won't stay up,'' Mr. McFarland said. ''Or they think it will help their golf games. At any rate, we don't ask. We're just glad they come to church.''</p>
