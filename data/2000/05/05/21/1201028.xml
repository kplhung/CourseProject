        <p>DANCE Theater of Harlem celebrates its 30th anniversary this year. The classical ballet company was founded by Arthur Mitchell, a leading dancer with the New York City Ballet at the time, in response to the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein, the founders of City Ballet, encouraged Mr. Mitchell to start the troupe.</p>
        <p>City Ballet will salute the company in three shared programs on Thursday, Saturday night and next Sunday afternoon at the New York State Theater. The two companies performed together at the State Theater in 1971. This week's event will include a new ballet, ''Tributary,'' choreographed by Robert Garland of Dance Theater and Robert La Fosse of City Ballet, as well as performances of Balanchine's ''Agon'' and ''Slaughter on Tenth Avenue,'' two works associated with Mr. Mitchell.</p>
        <p>In late March, Mr. Mitchell and Peter Martins, a principal dancer at City Ballet who became artistic director of the company after Balanchine's death in 1983, talked with Jennifer Dunning of The New York Times backstage at the State Theater about the joys and perils of directing ballet troupes. Here are excerpts from a conversation punctuated by roars of laughter and sympathetic murmurs.</p>
        <p>PETER MARTINS. What I often wonder, when I look back, is what it must have been like for Mr. B. when he started. What is the hardest thing: to establish something, to start from scratch, build something where there was nothing before? Or to maintain a colossal institution that requires so much attention in so many areas? Probably the toughest thing is to start something.</p>
        <p>ARTHUR MITCHELL. Well, it's something like six of one and half a dozen of the other. You have to have a maniacal belief in what you're doing. In the final analysis, I think the common denominator is the vision that we're all after. All of us want the best that we can do in the art form. We are in service, not servants, but in service to the art form. And once you understand that, everything else begins to fall in place.</p>
        <p>I look back at some of the things that Mr. B. and Lincoln were criticized for. Everyone says they want change, but when you try to change something they just resist you all the time. I think that tenacity rubbed off on us.</p>
        <p>JENNIFER DUNNING. How did you feel when you realized you were going to do this? Terror? Excitement?</p>
        <p>MARTINS. I never felt terror. Not one moment in my life. I don't know why. Excitement? No. Neither excitement nor terror. It was much more like it was the right thing. I had to do it. It was almost my calling.</p>
        <p>MITCHELL. You don't think in terms of terror. There is a sense of excitement. But you know this is the right thing to do and you are consumed with it. There are moments when you think, Oh, Lord, why me? But you are doing what you love to do. How many people ever get that opportunity?</p>
        <p>DUNNING. What were your earliest priorities?</p>
        <p>MARTINS. The very first thing that I thought of was stability. Somebody like George Balanchine passes away and you've got an organization here where everybody's sobbing and a lot of you couldn't even get to work. I've never seen such despair, and such misery, when he died, within these walls. Myself included. But there was no time to dwell on it. We had to go onstage two hours later. So life had to go on. My priority was to try to create an environment in which we could just go on. It was very important to put calmness on the agenda. To provide leadership that did not introduce change. I wanted continuation. And I wanted the natural time to go by. That was very very important to me.</p>
        <p>MITCHELL. With the assassination of Dr. King, I was driving through the streets of Harlem and I saw all this unrest and unhappiness. How could we funnel this into something that will be constructive, not destructive? The arts. And particularly dance, because it's so physical. And I said, ''Well, let me take the education I've had downtown with the New York City Ballet, Mr. Balanchine, Lincoln, all my colleagues, and start what could be like a haven, where young people can come in and get that sense of discipline and structure in their lives.''</p>
        <p>Not every child is going to be an artist or be a dancer. But they're learning how to live by doing. That sense of loss, of giving a sense of purpose, is what we're all about. When the physical entity has been taken away, you've got to put something in its place. And that is when you have to do what you do well.</p>
        <p>DUNNING. What are the priorities today?</p>
        <p>MITCHELL. Survival. It was a challenge years ago to prove that a dancer can be an administrator or fund-raiser. But that's not my goal. The Arthur Mitchell of 31 years ago and the Arthur Mitchell of today are totally different persons. I've only gone through high school. I've never been to college. So I don't know what Harvard Business School would do. I know what I would do.</p>
        <p>MARTINS. I would second Arthur by saying survival is always the No. 1 priority in the world in which we live. On the other hand, considering that it's been 17 years since Mr. B. died, and considering the health and the state of affairs of the New York City Ballet, both artistically and financially, and public attendance and so forth, I don't think it is premature to say that we sort of did survive. I look at the dancers and they're as fine as they've ever been, if not better. I look at the management team. It is extraordinary. I look at quality of life in this theater that has improved so vastly.</p>
        <p>I would say that the next thing I wish more than anything is new repertory. I think it is vitally important for the New York City Ballet to be able to identify -- or help identify -- choreographers of the future. To be able to create a repertory for the future that will appeal to today's public, and beyond that, I think is sort of my mandate.</p>
        <p>DUNNING. What are the most enjoyable and troublesome aspects of running a company today?</p>
        <p>MARTINS. Just yesterday or the day before, I taught class. And Arthur's and my own company kids were there. And there was something unbelievably enjoyable about being in that studio for an hour and a half trying to give these kids everything I know, that I had learned from Balanchine and elsewhere. And see how they soaked it up, with enthusiasm and hunger. That was a moment of great, great pleasure. Another moment is just to be in a studio choreographing with some of the best dancers anywhere.</p>
        <p>MITCHELL. Teaching, choreographing, coaching, working. All the other aspects are very intriguing but not really what you're about. For myself, I do it because I have to do it. At one time it was a challenge. But I've proven that, to myself anyway. So consequently I'd like to get back to what I should be about.</p>
        <p>DUNNING. Troubles?</p>
        <p>MARTINS. I never look at things as trouble. There are things I don't enjoy as much. I don't particularly love staying behind my desk and I basically don't ever do that. I sort of run around with papers in my hand. Running this company is like a puzzle. Every little piece works together. I love to deal with marketing. It fascinates me. But if I only did marketing, I'd go crazy. The fact is I can do that for an hour, and then go in and choreograph, and then run in and teach, and then go to a board meeting, and then have a fund-raising event. So I don't know if there's anything -- yes, the only thing I cannot bear is 8:30 morning meetings! Especially now that I am a suburbanite.</p>
        <p>MITCHELL. Yes, yes! I understand! Basically, we're night people.</p>
        <p>DUNNING. Is this a somewhat lonely job?</p>
        <p>MITCHELL. It's the aloneness of the long distance runner. If you are leading the pack, everyone is running behind you and looking at the back of your head. Occasionally, you'd like to look to the side and see somebody there.</p>
        <p>MARTINS. I don't feel lonely. But there are very, very tough decisions to be made. You have obviously a few people whom you trust and you ask advice and so forth. There have been two or three times in my life here when I thought: ''What would Mr. B. have done? What would Lincoln have advised?'' Those are the tough moments, I think. You go in and you close your door.</p>
        <p>DUNNING. Have there been things Balanchine or Kirstein said that proved particularly helpful?</p>
        <p>MITCHELL. Mr. B. used to say to me all the time: ''No, dear, don't listen to anybody. Don't take anybody's advice.'' Just do what you think is right. You will make mistakes. But at least you did what you believed.</p>
        <p>DUNNING. What might Balanchine say looking down on you and your two companies today?</p>
        <p>MITCHELL. ''Very good, my son.''</p>
        <p>MARTINS. Who knows? But I'd like to think that Mr. B. might say, ''You know, my dear, I can't tell you.'' And then he would probably say, ''No, not perfect, but still, amazing.'' That's what I think he would say. And you know what? He should be saying that.</p>
        <p>DUNNING. Should the Balanchine repertory be preserved in part by having dancers coach the roles they created?</p>
        <p>MARTINS. It depends. Can you remove yourself enough from when you danced the role? Once there was a very famous dancer here, coming and coaching another very famous dancer, in a very famous role. And I can tell you, Mr. B. had a fit. He said: ''He did it that way, and that was great for him. This one should do it his way.''</p>
        <p>MITCHELL. And the thing is, when you're dancing Mr. B.'s choreography, it's all in the music.</p>
        <p>MARTINS. There is a very famous ballet in this company, originated by a very famous ballerina, that has very famous images. And you know what? Those images were mannerisms. If you were not present when these things occurred, you automatically assume that that is the choreography. And I remember Mr. B.'s saying, ''I didn't choreograph that.'' I could go on and on and on about these famous or, if you want to call them infamous, stories. Don't forget, we were here. And the people who are writing about it, they don't know these things.</p>
        <p>MITCHELL. These are the moments that you asked about earlier. It's not loneliness, it's making decisions.</p>
        <p>DUNNING. Are you preparing successors?</p>
        <p>MARTINS. I'm not looking for a successor at all. I find myself very useful and vigorous. On the other hand, from the day I started I looked for people who might have the inclination to devote their life to what I have been doing in my life. But no one has emerged.</p>
        <p>MITCHELL. There's a hunger. There's something inside people. You can't stop it. And all you can say is: ''Pick my brain. Learn from me. I'll give you all the opportunities. But then are you willing to devote your life to this?'' Everything else is going to take second place. Mr. B. and Lincoln said I would never sleep again. Not that I think I'm going any place, because I asked the powers above to please take me away and they said: ''Not yet, my son. You've got much more to do.''</p>
