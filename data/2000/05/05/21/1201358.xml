        <p>If an era of peace is dawning in restive Aceh Province, no one seems to have told the villagers of Janthoe Baru.</p>
        <p>Since armed men descended from the nearby mountains on the night of May 7 and looted and razed 21 houses, around 1,500 terrified people have been sleeping every night at the village mosque.</p>
        <p>The destitute villagers, as well as officials in the nearby provincial capital, Banda Aceh, are either unsure about the identity of the armed men, who are blamed for a series of killings, looting and arson, or are afraid or unwilling to identify them.</p>
        <p>President Abdurrahman Wahid has conceded that rogue soldiers from the Indonesian Defense Forces might be involved in the attacks. But local police and military officials in Aceh say an unidentified ''third force'' of hired thugs, bandits, or even disgruntled independence fighters from the Free Aceh Movement is to blame.</p>
        <p>Separatists in Aceh, a staunchly Muslim region on the northern tip of Sumatra, have been fighting for independence since 1976 and pose a major problem for Mr. Wahid as he tries to stabilize his nation of 210 million people. Many people say that it is of far greater urgency for Indonesia to stop Aceh from slipping away than it was in the case of East Timor, which voted for independence last year.</p>
        <p>With Aceh, they say, the nation's sovereignty, stability and economic future are at stake. Aceh accounts for 13 percent of Indonesia's oil production and the shipping lanes through the Strait of Malacca between Aceh and Malaysia, are among the busiest in the world.</p>
        <p>Army generals in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, have made it clear that they will not allow Aceh to gain independence, a move that experts  have warned could set off a violent ''Balkans style'' breakup of Indonesia and threaten regional security in Southeast Asia.</p>
        <p>''We have seen the breakup of Europe,'' said Abdullah Ali, a leading political analyst and university professor in Banda Aceh. ''Who knows? We should keep our fingers crossed.''</p>
        <p>People across this province of four million are leaving nothing to chance. Mosques in Banda Aceh and other provincial centers have been packed daily with worshipers praying for the success of an agreement between the Indonesian government and the separatist guerrillas that was signed on May 12.</p>
        <p>The agreement, signed in Geneva, is seen as a first step to ending fighting that has killed as many as 5,000 people since 1989. The pact calls for a ''humanitarian pause'' in hostilities beginning in June and the establishment of two independent commissions to monitor the deal.</p>
        <p>But major issues have yet to be worked out, including autonomy for the province, disarming the rebels, and removing non-Acehenese military units. For their part, the rebels have refused to drop their 24-year-old demand for independence.</p>
        <p>A police spokesman here, Col. Safri Deangmapuji, said provocateurs had stepped up attacks to undermine trust between the Indonesian military and rebels. He blamed them for a grenade attack on a police traffic post last Sunday, two days after the peace agreement was signed. The authorities also suspect that the unidentified armed group lobbed a grenade at a police truck the next day, wounding three people.</p>
        <p>''It's really hard for the police,'' Colonel Deangmapuji said. ''We're trying to respect this agreement, but on the other hand you have this group running around trying to disrupt it.''</p>
        <p>Victims and witnesses said the attackers wore civilian clothes and sandals during some raids and military uniforms during others.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wahid initially said the provocateurs were rebels dressed in military uniforms, but at a recent news conference he said he had been told that ''some are rogue elements belonging to'' the armed forces.</p>
        <p>The military has logging and other business interests in Aceh, and does not want the province to break away as East Timor did.</p>
        <p>''When the central government tries to negotiate with the Free Aceh Movement, the military does not seem to agree that the government should sign an agreement,'' said Saifuddin Bantasyam, executive director of the Care Human Rights Forum in Banda Aceh.</p>
        <p>''And if there's something happening in Aceh, then the military can say there is no reason to sit down with the Free Aceh Movement,'' he said, adding that his organization had no evidence to implicate either the military or the rebel movement.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Bantasyam conceded that very few people had blamed rebels for attacks on civilians while the military has an extensive record of human rights abuses against the Acehenese, including killings, kidnappings and torture.</p>
