        <p>THERE may be construction dust on the steps and on the doorways without doors, but there are certain advantages to choosing a building that has just been renovated.</p>
        <p>When Brooks Thompson and Kelly Gaasland drove up to the old G. P. Putnam's Sons building in New Rochelle, N.Y., it had just been turned into lofts, and they were the first residents. They had moved to New York from Minnesota so Mr. Thompson could take a job with the Greyston Foundation in Yonkers, which runs a bakery that makes the brownies for Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream. The foundation, inspired by Buddhist teachings, also provides jobs and housing and runs a day-care center and community gardens.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson, 29, and Ms. Gaasland, 25,  knew very little about New York when they arrived last fall, and even less about Yonkers. ''We thought it was a borough,'' said Ms. Gaasland.</p>
        <p>With only three weeks to pack up and move to New York for his new job, Mr. Thompson arrived a month earlier than Ms. Gaasland and began the search for an apartment. He looked at some places in Yonkers, because he liked the idea of living where he worked, but the places he saw were uninspiring and ordinary.</p>
        <p>Then a friend at work told him about the lofts in the old factory building, which was the original printing plant for Putnam and the place where Washington Irving's first books were bound. In a phone call, he told Ms. Gaasland about the big brick building next to I-95 and the Metro-North railroad, and she was enthusiastic because it fit her image of New York and offered a radical change from what they knew.</p>
        <p>When they arrived on moving day with their cats, Leedle and Big Kitty, the building was still nearly empty, and they could roam through all 45 apartments, considering which they liked best. They moved into the apartment they had agreed to take, but when they wandered into another one, a huge two-story loft with ceilings that are more than double the usual height, they liked it even better. And the rent, at $1,475 a month, was only slightly more.</p>
        <p>The building, at 52 Webster Avenue, was renovated by AF&amp;F Community Builders, based in East Harlem, and by American Communities Fund, which was set up by Fannie Mae, the federally chartered home-financing corporation, to make equity investments in projects with community-development potential. It is meant to be affordable to people of moderate income in Westchester County, according to Eric Anderson, a principal of AF&amp;F. There are no income limits, and all the apartments have been rented.</p>
        <p>The two-story loft the couple chose has an open kitchen and dining area on the first floor, with a height that makes the 6-foot-6 Mr. Thompson look short. A beam that runs across the dining room provides a perfect place for the cats to show off their balancing skills. Upstairs is a large open space delineated not by walls but by furniture groupings. There's a living room, bedroom, office and a closet. But even the closet is open, with clothing hanging on exposed racks, not hiding behind doors.</p>
        <p>It's totally unlike the apartment they had in St. Louis Park, a suburb of Minneapolis, with regulation rooms and walls. ''When I first saw it, I went nuts,'' Ms. Gaasland said. ''I love the ceilings, the windows, the exposed pipe. He couldn't have done better.''</p>
        <p>Their decision to leave Minnesota was relatively abrupt. Mr. Thompson, a Vermont native who had his own video production company near Minneapolis, was restless and wanted to do something different. For fun, he would tend bar one night a week at a Bennigan's, where he met Ms. Gaasland, who was working as a waitress. A friend from Vermont was visiting and told him about a job opening at Greyston as a project director in real estate development.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson was intrigued. ''I came home one night and said, 'I think I want to go to Yonkers,' '' he remembered. Ms. Gaasland, who had grown up in Minneapolis and never visited New York, agreed to the move. ''I had nothing keeping me there,'' she said. ''I didn't have a job I was committed to.'' Shortly after their arrival, she found a job as a customer service representative at the inquiry center at GE Financial, in Stamford, Conn.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK, she said, has perfectly fit the image she had of it: It's exciting; the people are abrupt. ''I love it,'' she said. ''But going to a store and trying to get help is just not going to happen.'' Mr. Thompson, who went to the Midwest for college and stayed, said, ''Even the horses in Minnesota say excuse me.''</p>
        <p>On a recent evening, a friend from Greyston who also lives in the building stopped by. The building, they agreed, is perfect. It has only one tiny drawback: as Mr. Thompson put it, ''I'd rather live in this place, in the city.''</p>
        <p>They have, however, gotten to know a lot of people in their building, where the loftlike spaces and affordable rents have drawn people who work in Manhattan -- teachers and artists, many of them their age.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Thompson and Ms. Gaasland find the rent high, because they paid $750 a month for their two-bedroom apartment outside Minneapolis, the other residents, Mr. Thompson said, ''think it's a find.''</p>
