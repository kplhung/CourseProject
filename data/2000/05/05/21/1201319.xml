        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Although our city is thought of as a melting pot, New Yorkers, like all  Americans, have to learn to accept a growing segment of the population -- the children of biracial and multiracial marriages. It's a shame that in this day and age mixed families must endure stares and rude comments and biracial children have to answer questions about their heritage from curious strangers.</p>

        <p>Although our city is thought of as a melting pot, New Yorkers, like all  Americans, have to learn to accept a growing segment of the population -- the children of biracial and multiracial marriages. It's a shame that in this day and age mixed families must endure stares and rude comments and biracial children have to answer questions about their heritage from curious strangers.</p>
        <p>Yet, sometimes, out of the mouths of babes come the gems that put us all in our place. I think Trevor Sage-EL says it best -- he's the biracial (black/white) 10-year-old I interviewed for my children's book, ''Trevor's Story: Growing Up Biracial'' (Lerner Publications). When someone asks Trevor, ''What are you?'' he answers, ''Human.''</p>
