        <p>Rudolph Giuliani has pulled out of the New York Senate race, leaving his successor months behind in fund-raising, planning and glad-handing. How do you beat Hillary Clinton from a standing start? Here are a few words from some experts.</p>
        <p>Jerry Nachman, a former editor of The New York Post, is executive producer of ''Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher'':</p>
        <p>So you're some no-name Republican suddenly thrust into prominence and about to launch a campaign against someone with name recognition equal to Evita Peron's. As my mother would say, what could be bad? With no Rudy Giuliani baggage to carry, your ''unfavorable'' ratings are already hugely better than the ones for the woman who calls herself ''HILLARY!''</p>
        <p>Remember, it's not your police department you have to defend. You never kicked any little old ladies off the welfare rolls, or ticketed a jaywalker, or banished a hot-dog peddler or arrested some hapless cabbie. Or dumped your wife on live TV. There's your slogan: It Wasn't Me!</p>
        <p>That means your only opponent is Hillary, not yourself. And since she won't have Rudy to kick around anymore, she'll be required to defend herself. And thanks to your being nobody, she'll have nothing to attack. Until Friday, the race was going to be won by the candidate the voters disliked least. Now that's you. This is good, yes? Why didn't we think of this before?</p>
        <p>Frank Luntz has been Rudolph Giuliani's pollster since 1993:</p>
        <p>Let's face it: this election was never really about Rudy Giuliani. It has always been about Hillary Clinton.</p>
        <p>Most pollsters will tell you that attitudes toward Hillary were more important in determining voter preferences than their feelings toward Rudy. That being said, the reason why Rudy Guiliani was able to weather the past few weeks without any drop in public opinion was his incredible record of success in New York City.</p>
        <p>Hillary Clinton just doesn't have that record -- and that may prove to be the key weapon in Rick Lazio's political arsenal.</p>
        <p>The one question that Rick Lazio needs to present to the people of New York is, ''Can you name one thing Hillary Clinton has done for the people of New York?'' It's short, sweet, to the point and in my focus groups throughout the state, no one could answer it. Even her own advisers have trouble answering.</p>
        <p>Sean Wilentz is director of the American studies program at Princeton.</p>
        <p>Regardless of their candidate, Republicans will try to paint Hillary Clinton as an outsider, the carpetbagger without a record. But I'm not so sure this will work. Mrs. Clinton represents a distinct New York tradition, one that actually predates the ethnic pol -- the ambitious and talented arriviste.</p>
        <p>Compared with the other great eastern states -- Massachusetts with its Brahmins and River Gods, Pennsylvania with its inbred Quaker elite -- New York has always been remarkably open to upstarts -- socially as well as politically.</p>
        <p>The first outstanding New Yorker in the new nation's politics, Alexander Hamilton, was the West Indies-born son of an unremarkable Scottish peddler. After Hamilton came George Clinton, the Jeffersonian Democrat, and his nephew, DeWitt. Descendants of moderately prosperous immigrant farmers from Ulster County, they both served auspicious terms as New York's governor. Then came Martin Van Buren, the cunning, self-made son of a tavernkeeper from Kinderhook. After two Senate terms, he became the first New Yorker to win the White House.</p>
        <p>New Yorkers have welcomed out-of-staters, particularly, it seems, when it comes to choosing their Senate candidates. Not only the oft-mentioned Robert Kennedy of Massachusetts and James Buckley of Connecticut, but also Ramsey Clark of Texas, the Democratic senatorial nominee in 1972. Indeed, New York's very first senator, Rufus King, began his political career as a delegate to the Continental Congress -- from Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>So while Republicans may try to make the carpetbagger charge stick, I'm not so sure it will work.</p>
        <p>Richard Bond is a former Republican National Committee chairman:</p>
        <p>Hillary Clinton lost a formidable opponent in Rudy Giuliani. He had a proven record of attracting crossover Democrats, and a Republican Senate candidate has to have that appeal.  While the dynamics of the race have changed, however, Mrs. Clinton's uphill battle to win this Senate seat hasn't.</p>
        <p>First, there is no such thing as a standing start for any Republican running against her, even in New York.  Polls showed her support at a steady 44 percent, and despite Mayor Giuliani's troubles over the past two weeks, her support has barely moved.</p>
        <p>Second, a recent decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the  10th Circuit tossed out Federal Election Commission restrictions on party contributions to congressional candidates. Although this court has jurisdiction only over six Western states, both parties have indicated that they will apply it nationally. Thus, fund-raising will not be an issue for the New York Senate candidate. The party could legally write out a multimillion-dollar check tomorrow to provide financial parity.</p>
        <p>Mitchell L. Moss is director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University.</p>
        <p>Without Rudy Giuliani in the race, Mrs. Clinton will have to work much harder to mobilize minority groups in New York City. African-American voters are enthusiastic supporters of Bill Clinton, but it's not clear that the president's popularity is automatically transferred to his wife. Mrs. Clinton was counting on anti-Giuliani sentiment to bring out her voters in minority areas.</p>
        <p>More important, Republicans can now nominate a candidate with suburban roots who will carry the Conservative Party imprimatur, a clone of genial George Pataki. Furthermore, Hillary Clinton cannot rely on upstate voters to instinctively oppose a politician from New York City. Without the mayor, Republicans will do better upstate and in the suburbs.</p>
        <p>Stuart Rothenberg is the editor of Rothenberg Political Report:</p>
        <p>Rick Lazio could actually turn out to be a stronger opponent than Rudy Giuliani. He is a moderate who voted for family and medical leave; he backs gun control and has been supported by environmental groups.  Even more important, the four-term congressman from Suffolk County doesn't carry the mayor's personal or political baggage. He's more personable and unthreatening than Giuliani, and he doesn't have to worry that a shooting, racial incident or City Hall scandal will derail his Senate bid. Lazio could re-create the same coalition of upstate and suburban voters that helped George Pataki oust another political celebrity, Mario Cuomo, in 1994.</p>
        <p>Donald Trump, the real estate developer, is author, with Dave Shiflett, of ''The America We Deserve.''</p>
        <p>Hillary has proved over a long period of time that she is very tough, tenacious and smart. Whoever runs against her will have to have those qualities in even greater abundance because her name recognition and celebrity are so very high.</p>
        <p>Stick to the issues and work very hard -- and the anti-Hillary vote may just be a big surprise in November.</p>
