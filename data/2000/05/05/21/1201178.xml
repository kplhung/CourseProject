      <abstract>
        <p>Pop quartet Luna, with lead singer Dean Wareham, is scheduled to perform at Maxwell's in Hoboken, NJ (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>While Luna certainly can't be accused of creating happy pop music (the jaunty ''Dear Diary'' comes close), there is a sly smile and wink inherent in the songs of Dean Wareham's New York moody, atmospheric quartet.</p>
        <p>The textured, often psychedelic, guitar work mixed with wry lyricism demand comparisons with the Velvet Underground, and at their most hypnotic and somnambulistic, they even conjure up the warm, comforting sounds of early R.E.M. Retaining his world-weary vocals from his former band Galaxie 500, Mr. Wareham is the glue that holds this ethereal-sounding band together.</p>

        <p>The test: They sing in German without seeming pretentious, and they perform a Guns N Roses classic ''Sweet Child O' Mine,'' turning it into a graceful moodpiece.</p>
        <p>Luna appears at 10 p.m. Friday and next Saturday at Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, (201) 653-1703.</p>
