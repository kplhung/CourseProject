        <p>Mary Paulding Rouse, a daughter of Emy M. Halpert of Philadelphia and Willard G. Rouse III of Phoenixville, Pa., was married on Friday to Fabio Terlevich, the son of Bianca and Luciano Terlevich of Buenos Aires. The Rev. Douglas Scott performed the Episcopal ceremony at St. Martin's Church in Radnor, Pa.</p>
        <p>The bride is known as Molly. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, from which she will receive a master's degree in education tomorrow. Today, the bridegroom is to receive an M.B.A. degree from Penn.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rouse, who will keep her name, is an executive board member of the auxiliary of Pennsylvania Hospital. Her father is the chairman of Liberty Property Trust, a real estate development company in Malvern, Pa. Her mother is the director of the special programs division at the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia. The bride's previous marriage ended in divorce. Ms. Rouse is a stepdaughter of Susannah Rouse, who founded and directs an elephant protection program in Nairobi, Kenya, and of Michael Halpert, the chief executive of PhilaHide, a commodity trading business in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>She is a descendant of John Marshall, the 19th-century Chief Justice of the United States. Her paternal grandfather, James Rouse, oversaw the renovation and development of Faneuil Hall in Boston and the South Street Seaport in New York through his business, the Rouse Company.</p>
        <p>In July, Mr. Terlevich is to become a senior associate in the London office of Advent International, an investment equity and venture capital company.
