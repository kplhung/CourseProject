        <p>After the improbable loss to the Knicks on Friday night, one in which the Heat let a 15-point lead slip away in the second half, Dan Majerle said he never should have been called for a foul with 17.6 seconds left that sent Allan Houston to the line for the game's decisive points.</p>
        <p>Yet after such a devastating loss, the Heat players grasped for reasons to believe that Game 7 today would be different from the last two years, when the Heat had to watch the Knicks celebrate in Miami and move on in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''All series long, nobody has been able to win two games in a row,'' Majerle said Friday night. ''I'm sure they feel good about themselves after what they did in the second half. But we're going back home to Miami, where the fans have been great, and you know we have played pretty well there. So I think we've got the confidence and I think we've got the momentum.</p>
        <p>''It's tough, but we have to realize what this is all about. It's a one-game series now, but this game, it all comes down to who wins. We fought all year to have home-court advantage, and that's what we got it for. We've got to forget about this, which I know we will. We'll go out and play awfully hard on Sunday and play our best game.''</p>
        <p>Tim Hardaway agreed.</p>
        <p>''It shouldn't be that tough pulling it together and coming on Sunday to play,'' Hardaway said. ''We've just got to come back and play the same way for 48 minutes that we played in the first half.''</p>
        <p>A Day Off for Heat</p>
        <p>Heat Coach Pat Riley gave his players yesterday off, reversing his usual playoff pattern.</p>
        <p>Riley said he thought ''it might have been a mistake'' last year to have his players practice the day before a decisive game ''because there was really nothing to cover.''  Last year, the Heat lost at home to the Knicks in the deciding Game 5, 78-77.</p>
        <p>Riley recommended one thing for his players not to do yesterday: read the newspaper.</p>
        <p>''We know what happened at the end and we don't have to analyze it,'' he said. ''We can't think about Friday night anymore.''</p>
        <p>Riley said he has a good feeling about his team. ''They're disappointed, but they have great resolve and they'll be back stronger than ever tomorrow,'' he said. ''I believe that.''</p>
