        <p>IT took Yasir Arafat many years to arrive at the gate of Jerusalem. But last week, when Israel conceded to him full control of Abu Dis and two other villages, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization moved one step nearer to a dream that had sustained him through his exile in Tunisia. The villages are a morsel of greater Jerusalem, but one with a bird's eye view of the gold-leafed Dome of the Rock.</p>
        <p>Jerusalem is well known to be an intense symbolic focal point for both Israelis and Palestinians -- as well as for Jews, Christians and Muslims worldwide. But when the dusty neighboring town of Abu Dis was finally given over to Palestinian control, it briefly reminded everyone that even physical Jerusalem is a loaded concept: its borders, fixed on a map, are blurred on the ground in an emotionally complicated, politicized way.</p>
        <p>Abu Dis epitomizes a reality usually obscured in the simplistic public debate about Jerusalem and its fate: Just as the village is integrated with the Jerusalem area geographically, economically and socially, East Jerusalem itself is entwined with the West Bank.</p>
        <p>That became clear last week, but it was still left unsaid. Jerusalem is rarely publicly discussed by Israeli or Palestinian leaders in anything but black-and-white terms. It is the ''eternal, undivided capital'' of Israel, on the one hand, and the future capital of the Palestinian state on the other: seemingly irreconcilable concepts that have led many intelligent politicians to recommend that the issue be left unresolved in the current, supposedly final, peace talks.</p>
        <p>But Jerusalem is very much on the table in the serious, non-secret back-channel negotiations that are under way in Stockholm. And experts agree that the private discussion will have to be creative and realistic enough to take into account the lessons of Abu Dis and acknowledge that the dynamic on the Jerusalem issue shifted last week, even if quietly.</p>
        <p>''Now when you are talking about sovereignty, the Palestinian people will say we are in the sphere,'' said Zakaria al Qaq, co-director of the Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information in Jerusalem. ''It is no longer pure abstraction. That battle for Jerusalem that was being waged long distance will now be fought up close.''</p>
        <p>Still, Israel's decision was hardly celebrated. In fact, as the Parliament was voting to transfer the territory to the Palestinians, the West Bank was aflame in violent confrontation with the Israelis. When the intense violence died down, Palestinians made it clear that they were not elated, even if they were relieved. Israel was supposed to withdraw from 28 villages in the Jerusalem area by last year under the Oslo peace agreement, they said. Just three was too little, too late.</p>
        <p>And furthermore: Abu Dis looks like a village and, with raw sewage flowing roadside, it smells like a village. No Palestinian will ever mistake Abu Dis for Jerusalem itself. If the Israelis intend it as an alternative capital for the Palestinians state, which is what Mr. Barak seemed to be saying last week, Palestinians find this an insult, a joke and a deal-breaker.</p>
        <p>STILL, Abu Dis is closer to the heart of the contested city than is the Israeli Parliament or the Israeli prime minister's headquarters. After the physical transfer takes place, Mr. Arafat can be photographed with his uniformed troops against the backdrop of the famous minaret of the holy city's skyline. He can open an office in the town's modern new governmental building and place his desk chair in Jerusalem proper, since the building is reportedly a few feet over the border.</p>
        <p>Only the Israeli right wing reacted last week with audible emotion -- anger. They saw the concession of Abu Dis to mean that the peace talks had come to the endpoint they had long feared: a negotiation over the status of Jerusalem itself. In tours of Abu Dis, they found out what Palestinians know: Abu Dis and the other two villages may not be Jerusalem, but on the ground that distinction vanishes.</p>
        <p>The municipal border actually transects the town, so the only way to tell where Jerusalem leaves off and Abu Dis begins is by the city sidewalks that abruptly end. Abu Dis residents work in Jerusalem, shop in Jerusalem and pray in Jerusalem -- whether or not they have proper papers to move back and forth. There are seven checkpoints leading to Jerusalem from the West Bank, one official noted, but there are 70 roads and paths by which to enter.</p>
        <p>''The current municipal boundaries are irrelevant,'' said Menachem Klein, a senior fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies. ''Abu Dis is part of Jerusalem functionally, just as the 200,000 Palestinians in Jerusalem are part of the West Bank. No Israeli or Palestinian leader can ignore this reality, whatever they say publicly.''</p>
        <p>It is a reality that existed when the Jordanians held East Jerusalem and the West Bank, continued after the Israeli annexation of East Jerusalem, and quietly redefined itself after the P.L.O. returned from exile and became the Palestinian Authority.</p>
        <p>Through his ministers, Mr. Barak has leaked some ideas for addressing this reality, ideas more nuanced than his public discourse. In addition to testing the potentially explosive notion of internationalizing the Old City, they have floated the possibility of ceding civil control of the Palestinian population to the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>In their public response, Palestinian officials sneered, since the idea does not include land.</p>
        <p>Still, Abu Dis has been a prime example of just how completely the Palestinians can control something that is not really theirs.</p>
        <p>Jamil Osman Nasser, a senior P.L.O. veteran, was named the governor of Jerusalem for the Palestinian Authority at the start of 1996. Jerusalem proper being unavailable, he opened his main office in Abu Dis, in a former Israeli military headquarters that originally served as the mansion of a key clan -- the Erekat family of Saeb Erekat, a senior negotiator.</p>
        <p>From the veranda, the Dome of the Rock seems a stone's throw away. Inside, a three-dimensional replica of the dome graces the governor's coffee table, and above it hangs a wall-sized photograph of the dome-dominated skyline.</p>
        <p>''We don't believe in divisions between the West Bank and Jerusalem,'' the governor said over a glass of sweet, hot tea.</p>
        <p>Residents of Jerusalem send representatives to the Palestinian legislature and the Palestinian entity is part of their lives -- not only politically but organically, since it is involved in their schools, their health insurance claims, their properties and their families. Palestinians regularly travel to Abu Dis so that the governor can adjudicate  their disputes.</p>
        <p>Since the Palestinian Authority was created, Abu Dis has been built up partly because of its proximity to Jerusalem and partly for parochial reasons. Abu Ala, a senior P.L.O official and now the Parliament speaker, re-settled there, in his clan's village, and this created a boomlet. Abu Dis became home to the largest branch of Al-Quds University, to many ministries and to the new government building that everyone imagines to be the future Palestinian Parliament.</p>
        <p>Israel technically retained security control of Abu Dis until it finally relinquished that last week. But the Jerusalem commander of the Palestinian police is already based there, as are four branches of Mr. Arafat's security forces -- minus their uniforms and supposedly minus their guns.</p>
        <p>THAT is why even in Abu Dis, the Israeli vote was seen as a largely symbolic step. It even raised fears among residents that a border fence would be built to separate them from Jerusalem, and that they and the Palestinian people would be left with their noses pressed against the slats -- so close and so far away.</p>
        <p>''We are today closer than ever to Jerusalem,'' said Abdul Rahman al-Shamali, the muezzin who calls Muslims to prayer at one of five mosques in the conservative, religious town. ''But to be frank, I am sad. I fear that it will end here. I fear that my heart is going to be divided. Jerusalem is my heart.''</p>
