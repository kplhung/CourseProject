        <p>THIS city's rebounding office market has received another major boost with the announcement this month that Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide plans to lease more than 200,000 square feet, occupying an entire office building along the Interstate 287 corridor, where it expects to establish its world headquarters.</p>
        <p>''This is the biggest lease we've seen in Westchester in several years,'' said Frank Tomasulo, a first vice president with the CB Richard Ellis brokerage company.

        <p>THIS city's rebounding office market has received another major boost with the announcement this month that Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide plans to lease more than 200,000 square feet, occupying an entire office building along the Interstate 287 corridor, where it expects to establish its world headquarters.</p>
        <p>''This is the biggest lease we've seen in Westchester in several years,'' said Frank Tomasulo, a first vice president with the CB Richard Ellis brokerage company. ''It's way beyond the size of the leases we've been seeing lately, and is indicative of what's happening now in Westchester's market. Lots of companies that are now looking for large blocks of space are looking in Westchester because they can't find them in Fairfield County or in New York City anymore.''</p>
        <p>Starwood had been looking for an appropriate headquarters location for about three years, according to Rob Martin, a senior managing director for Insignia/ESG, which had been representing the company in its search, which also included lower Fairfield County. Starwood eventually settled on 1129 Westchester Avenue, along what is known as the county's Platinum Mile, a stretch of corporate parks bordering Interstate 287 that is considered one of the most prestigious office locations in the county.</p>
        <p>Although most recently used as a corporate headquarters for Nine West, the shoe company, 1129 Westchester Avenue was built on speculation and designed for multitenancy.</p>
        <p>''Starwood wanted a prestigious Class A building,'' Mr. Martin said. ''That was the most important thing, since they have clients coming in from all over the world and need the right image. It also has good visibility from the highway and is convenient.''</p>
        <p>Starwood will sublet the space for 12 years from Nine West, which had once occupied a total of 366,000 square feet at 1129 and 1109 Westchester Avenue. Nine West recently downsized to 90,000 square feet at 1109, and sublets 30,000 square feet in that building to Ameritrade, an Internet trading company.</p>
        <p>Nine West has offered Starwood the option of expanding into 1109 if space becomes available. Starwood is ''a growing company,'' Mr. Martin said, ''and it was important to them to have the possibility of expansion.''</p>
        <p>While they looked for permanent space, Starwood took out short-term leases in two other White Plains buildings, at 777 Westchester Avenue and 44 South Broadway. ''We were always shuttling back and forth between meetings,'' said Seth Ruzi, associate general counsel for Starwood. ''We needed someplace to consolidate. And staying in White Plains was desirable since it will make things easier on our employees who already work here.''</p>
        <p>STARWOOD expects to complete its move into the new building in the second and third quarters of 2001. And it expects to retain its present Westchester work force of 300, and add an additional 300 employees by 2006.</p>
        <p>Starwood, which recently acquired the Sheraton and Westin hotel chains, is now one of the largest hotel and leisure companies in the world. Through its subsidiaries, it now owns and operates 700 hotels in 80 countries, said Dan Gibson, a senior vice president of corporate affairs. In May 1998, the company relocated its headquarters from Phoenix.</p>
        <p>A major inducement in selecting Westchester for its permanent headquarters, Mr. Ruzi said, was the ''cooperation of the state and county governments,'' as well as a package of economic incentives that include tax abatements worth $775,000, provided by the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency, and a $500,000 jobs-creation grant from the state.</p>
        <p>The state grant is contingent on Starwood's maintaining its current Westchester work force and adding 150 more jobs by  2003, said Maura Gallucci, a spokeswoman for the Empire State Development Corporation.</p>
        <p>Although Starwood's may be the largest lease signed in Westchester in many years, it is part of a trend toward larger leases that has been established in the last several quarters, according to Mr. Tomasulo. ''Anything over 200,000 square feet is, of course, rare,'' he said. ''But we've seen several large leases recently.''</p>
        <p>Last year Atlas Air leased 120,000 square feet at Texaco's headquarters building, at 2000 Westchester Avenue in White Plains.  Also in recent months Towers Perrin leased  108,407 square feet at 100 Summit Lake Drive in Valhalla; AT&amp;T took 95,000 square feet at 500 Mamaroneck Avenue in Harrison; and Metromedia leased 80,000 square feet at 360 Hamilton Avenue in White Plains.</p>
        <p>''There's been a 50 percent increase in the last 18 months in leases in excess of 25,000 square feet,'' said Al Gutierrez, a senior associate with CB Richard Ellis.</p>
        <p>''The leases now are way beyond the sizes we had been seeing in the market,'' he said, where average leases had been around 7,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tomasulo said that ''companies looking for large blocks of space are now looking at Westchester.''</p>
        <p>THERE are still several large blocks of space available,'' he said. ''And we know that major companies are now looking at them.''</p>
        <p>Some of the large blocks left include the former Kraft Food headquarters at 333 Westchester Avenue in White Plains, with more than 500,000 square feet; Mount Pleasant Executive Center in Mount Pleasant, with 380,000 square feet; and 445 Hamilton Avenue in White Plains, with 350,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>Westchester's office vacancy rate in the first quarter of this year reached its lowest point in a decade.</p>
        <p>The countywide rate of 12.5 percent was down from 17.6 percent at the end of last year, according to CB Richard Ellis. And the amount of vacant space dropped by 458,423 square feet in the first quarter of 2000, compared to a drop of 181,174 in the last quarter of 1999.</p>
        <p>As a result, rents have been creeping up, but are still a comparative bargain in relation to Fairfield County and Manhattan, where rents can be 30 percent to 65 percent higher respectively.</p>
        <p>Average annual asking rents in Westchester are now $24.48 per square foot, relatively unchanged since the end of last year, but up from $20.94 in the first quarter of 1999, according to CB Richard Ellis.</p>
        <p>''If we had been able to find the right property for Starwood in Fairfield, it might have won out and they'd have moved there,'' said Mr. Martin of Insignia/ESG. ''But the economics of Westchester sort of evened the playing field. In White Plains, they're saving 30 percent, and could even expand if they want to. As it turned out, that was very significant.''</p>
