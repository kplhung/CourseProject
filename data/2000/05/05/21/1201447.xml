        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>It really makes no difference to me whether Indiana University wants to give its basketball coach, Bob Knight, another chance after a series of episodes of lost temper and violent outbursts. One does wonder, though, what would have happened if any student victims of those outbursts had responded in kind. Maybe the rule should change from ''don't talk back to your teachers'' to ''don't hit your teachers back.''</p>
