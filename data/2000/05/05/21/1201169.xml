        <p>THE North Fork has been home to an arts community since the late 19th century, but until recently there was little evidence of it in a region dominated by agriculture and maritime industries. Most of the area's resident artists have traditionally kept a low profile, preferring to remain unobtrusively domesticated. Visitors have been drawn by farm stands, antique shops and seafood restaurants, not art galleries. Lately, wineries have been added to the list of attractions, and the artists' low profile has been raised by the appearance of new venues for their work, as well as encouragement on the part of the larger community.</p>

        <p>THE North Fork has been home to an arts community since the late 19th century, but until recently there was little evidence of it in a region dominated by agriculture and maritime industries. Most of the area's resident artists have traditionally kept a low profile, preferring to remain unobtrusively domesticated. Visitors have been drawn by farm stands, antique shops and seafood restaurants, not art galleries. Lately, wineries have been added to the list of attractions, and the artists' low profile has been raised by the appearance of new venues for their work, as well as encouragement on the part of the larger community.</p>
        <p>Over the past decade, but most intensively since 1997, the area has seen a burgeoning of cultural activity. Commercial galleries and various nonprofit arts initiatives are centered in the Village of Greenport, where the administration has made a commitment to the visual and performing arts part of its overall revitalization effort.</p>
        <p>According to Greenport's mayor, Dave Kapell, the combination of officially sponsored and private arts projects is designed to ''enhance the aesthetic qualities of the village'' and provide enrichment for the year-round residents, rather than as a stimulus to seasonal tourism. That opinion is seconded by Gail F. Horton, an artist who serves on the village board and is chairwoman of its Standing Committee on Arts and Culture. In addition to $13,000 in discretionary funds from the village budget, the committee contributes the professional and technical expertise of some 20 volunteer members. They are involved in a wide range of activities, from organizing the annual ''Footfalls'' exhibition of site-specific art to changing local zoning regulations to allow loft living for artists.</p>
        <p>''Our program is not event-oriented,'' Ms. Horton said, although the committee provides financial support and in-kind services like labor and materials for temporary exhibitions and performances of Shakespeare in the Park. The committee also finances a visiting-artist program, initiated in 1998 with the pianist Peter Serkin, to bring master musicians to the schools. According to Ms. Horton, the overall aim is ''toward stabilizing the arts in the community.''</p>
        <p>One such initiative is the construction of an amphitheater as part of the Mitchell Park redevelopment on the Greenport waterfront. Intended primarily for band concerts, the facility will also be adaptable for other types of performance. Another stabilization tool is the zoning amendment, enacted two years ago, that allows vacant property formerly restricted to commercial use to be renovated as living and work space for artists.</p>
        <p>The pilot project is the conversion, now under way, of the upstairs space at 123 Main Street, formerly the Mills Canvas building, a sail loft that had been vacant since the mid-1980's. The second and third floors will eventually house four artists' living lofts and two duplex units, with rents starting at $1,000 a month. Two artists -- Poppy Johnson, a painter, and Jonathan Levitan, a sculptor -- are already in residence. The ground floor, with facades on both Main and Front Streets, has retail stores.</p>
        <p>On a recent walk around the business district, Mayor Kapell noted that, with many rents at $15 to $17 a square foot, ''retail space is still very affordable here.''</p>
        <p>Greenport village, with a population of just over 2,200, now boasts six art galleries, seven if one includes the exhibition space in the new wing of the William Floyd Memorial Library on First Street. Island Artists, a co-operative gallery that also rents exhibition space, is at 429 Main Street. The nearby Artists Gallery, at 407 Main Street, specializes in Haitian art, while more decorative fare is the staple at the Gazebo Gallery, at 124 Main Street, near the marina. One of the newest is Art Sites, a compact but handsome space at 211 East Front Street (also marked Carpenter Street), a stone's throw from the Main Street intersection. Opened in February by Glinys Berry, an architect who heads the state Department of Transportation's capital program, the gallery showcases both local and international artists and has a special focus on ceramics.</p>
        <p>Ms. Berry, who has a house in Orient, was attracted to Greenport's New England atmosphere. ''The village is great for walking,'' she said.  ''People feel comfortable strolling here. And there are a lot of people interested in the arts.'' Although she opened in the winter, with a show of photographs by Sun-Chang Lo, who is now working in Hong Kong, ''people really responded. It was fantastic,'' she said. Sales of the ceramics have been especially strong, and she plans to offer small works at affordable prices, as in her current show, on view through June 4, of prints by Martin Barooshian of New York City, Judy McCaig, a Scottish artist, and Mirelle, who lives in Paris.</p>
        <p>At the other end of the commercial district, on the second floor of a former marine equipment warehouse at 414 First Street, the newest of Greenport's six art galleries, Whitney Art Works, celebrated its opening on May 13. The complex of late-19th century buildings, in which an ice company once operated, now houses the gallery, an art moving and storage business, a woodworker and a glass blower. And, as if to affirm the SoHo analogy, a gourmet food store (known locally as Greenport's answer to Dean &amp; Deluca) has opened across from the loading dock.</p>
        <p>''This has been a dream of mine,'' said the gallery's owner, Deborah Whitney. After working at New York University's Grey Art Gallery and Artists' Space in Manhattan, she moved to the area three years ago and is now the curator at the East End Arts Council in Riverhead. Her inaugural exhibition, ''Color,'' on view through July 2, features paintings and works on paper by seven artists and includes a group of her own landscapes. Still lifes by Kate Winn, paper-pulp assemblages by Geoffrey Leven, landscape paintings by Ty Stroudsburg, Margery Gosnell and Daniel Gosnell, and Iris prints by Liza Cowan are also on view. Three shows, with a mixture of local and New York City artists, are planned for this summer.</p>
        <p>After a break in the fall, Ms. Whitney is planning a show for the holiday season and a year-round schedule of eight shows for next year. She would also like to offer events like poetry readings at the gallery, a 1,000-square-foot space that contrasts smooth white walls with raw wood floors and an impressive beamed ceiling that has been left exposed, highlighting the building's industrial character.</p>
        <p>The gallery's back windows look out on the garden of Yellow House Works of Art, a charming Victorian residence at 422 First Street, which opened as a gallery in 1994. It is owned by Mr. Leven, one of the artists in Ms. Whitney's ''Color'' show, who divides his time between New York City and Greenport, where he displays contemporary art in a welcoming domestic environment.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to give people something they could feel comfortable with,'' Mr. Leven explained. ''Some people are intimidated by modern art in a gallery setting, but it's more accessible in the context of a home.''  His first exhibition of the season, ''Aspects of Desire,'' will open on July 15. Like Ms. Berry, Mr. Leven experienced a positive response to his gallery right from the start. ''It was instantly embraced by the community,'' he said, adding that it has paid for itself since its opening six years ago.</p>
        <p>In addition to running the Yellow House, Mr. Leven is also a member of the village board's arts and culture committee, for which he is organizing, with Ms. Horton, a historical exhibition of paintings by Whitney M. Hubbard (1875-1965), who taught art in Greenport for many years. The show, with a catalog by Ronald G. Pisano, will open on June 17 at the local Masonic Temple -- yet another art venue, if only temporarily -- and travel to the Museums at Stony Brook in August.</p>
        <p>The committee is also sponsoring ''Footfalls,'' a village-wide public art project that will open its forth season on June 24. Coordinated by Ms. Horton and fellow artists Poppy Johnson, Brenda Miller, Arden Scott and Marianne Weil, the project consists of site-specific pieces by 13 artists, installed in locations throughout the village. The work will remain on view through September 24. Like its predecessors, this year's ''Footfalls'' will have a Web site, and a catalog and map will be available to help guide visitors. There is also the option of ignoring orientation tools and encountering the works unexpectedly while strolling along the waterfront, browsing in shop windows or even, as in a past exhibition, using the public rest rooms.</p>
