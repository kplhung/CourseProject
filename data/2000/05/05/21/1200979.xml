        <p>Take Me Out to . . .</p>
        <p>Q. With the opening of baseball season and three new major league ballparks, I'd like to see some classic parks -- like Fenway Park, Yankee Stadium, Wrigley Field or County Stadium -- before they close. Is there a company with trips to these parks? -- Peter Thomas, New York, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. With one exception, you have plenty of time to see those four parks. There are no concrete plans to replace Wrigley Field in Chicago or Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, and the Boston Red Sox say they won't open a new Fenway until at least 2003. Milwaukee's County Stadium is in its last year, though, so you may want to get there before the Brewers move to Miller Park next season.</p>

        <p>Take Me Out to . . .</p>
        <p>Q. With the opening of baseball season and three new major league ballparks, I'd like to see some classic parks -- like Fenway Park, Yankee Stadium, Wrigley Field or County Stadium -- before they close. Is there a company with trips to these parks? -- Peter Thomas, New York, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. With one exception, you have plenty of time to see those four parks. There are no concrete plans to replace Wrigley Field in Chicago or Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, and the Boston Red Sox say they won't open a new Fenway until at least 2003. Milwaukee's County Stadium is in its last year, though, so you may want to get there before the Brewers move to Miller Park next season.</p>
        <p>There are at least three companies specializing in taking people out to the ballpark. But the one trip going to all four of those old stadiums requires a good chunk of the season: Sports Travel Inc.'s Millennium Tour visits all 30 major league parks and the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown from July 14 to Aug. 17. The cost, including air and ground transportation, hotels and game tickets, is $5,995 a person, double occupancy.</p>
        <p>Sports Travel offers two other trips that each go to two of those parks. One is the Windy City tour, July 1 to 3, taking in games at Wrigley and Comiskey Park in Chicago, and one in Milwaukee. It costs $595, double occupancy, including bus, tickets and two nights at the Wyndham in Chicago. The Classic, July 19 to 23, goes to Baltimore; Yankee Stadium; Cooperstown; and Fenway Park. The $1,050 cost includes tickets, bus and double rooms in the Baltimore Hilton and the Grand Hyatt in New York.</p>
        <p>Contact Sports Travel at 60 Main Street, Hatfield, Mass. 01038; (800) 662-4424, fax (413) 247-5700; www.4sportstravel.com.</p>
        <p>From July 13 to 19, Diamond Baseball Tours, 121 Blackberry Drive, Morehead, Ky. 40351, is offering a Hall of Fame tour that begins with a game in Detroit's new Comerica Park and goes to Toronto, Cooperstown, Boston, Yankee Stadium and Baltimore. The $770 double occupancy price includes bus travel, game tickets, Hall of Fame admission and lodging in Best Westerns, Ramadas, Comfort Inns and the like.</p>
        <p>The next week, July 20 to 27, Diamond has a trip to Cleveland, Yankee Stadium, the Hall of Fame induction ceremony, Boston, Baltimore, Shea Stadium (the Mets) and Pittsburgh. The cost is $950, double. Diamond is at (800) 275-1567, fax (606) 783-1816; www.diamondbaseballtours.com.</p>
        <p>Another company, Roadtrips, 191 Lombard Avenue, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, R3B 0X1, (800) 465-1765, fax (204) 957-1241, has similar tours, but none go to more than one of those classic parks. But it will, an agent said, customize itineraries.</p>
        <p>Arizona Hiking Tours</p>
        <p>Q. I would like to arrange moderate day hikes in the Sedona and Grand Canyon areas in Arizona during a coming trip. Are there companies that lead such hikes? -- Dolores Swirin, Bronx, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. The Sedona Chamber of Commerce, (800) 288-7336, says most tours of the famous red rock country are in four-wheel-drive vehicles. But it did suggest two outfits for hikes.</p>
        <p>At one, Sedona Adventures, Cindy Panettiery, the reservations manager, said her company would arrange guided tours of two and a half or four hours for at least four people. The guide will plan the route with the party, based on fitness levels, and secure any necessary permits for the National Forest. Some of the easier trails available are Doe Mesa, Devil's Bridge and Bear Wall; moderate ones include Bear Sign, Schnebly Diagonal and Secret Canyon. The cost is $45 a person for the shorter hikes and $65 for four hours.</p>
        <p>Sedona Adventures, Post Office Box 1476, Sedona Ariz. 86339; (800) 888-9494, fax (520) 282-9055.</p>
        <p>The other hiking guide goes by the name Rahelio and runs Sedona Nature Excursions, (520) 282-6735, fax 282-0134, www.rahelio.com. He says he specializes in Native American spiritual experiences but also leads fitness hikes. Some of the trails he goes to are Boynton Canyon, Bear Mountain and Schnebly Hill. Rates are $45 for two and a half hours and $65 for three and a half, but somewhat more for a single hiker.</p>
        <p>Because the Grand Canyon is such a harsh environment, hiking there is serious business, according to Margee Hench, a former ranger who is the communications specialist at the Grand Canyon National Park. So, she recommends asking these questions of any potential guides:</p>
        <p>Are they insured? How much experience do they have as guides in the Grand Canyon? If you want a multiday hike, can they guarantee having park permits for the days you want to go? And finally, do they hold at least a Wilderness First Responder card, a level below Emergency Medical Technician?</p>
        <p>The park's Web site, www .thecanyon.com/nps, lists the park's licensed back-country guides. Of these, two can be hired through South Rim Travel, in Williams, Ariz., (888) 291-9116, fax (520) 625-9039: Canyon Dreams, which charges $95 a day per person ($50 a half day) for day hikes, and Grand Canyon Trail Guides, whose eight-hour hikes cost $125 each, including lunch.</p>
        <p>You can get information and advice about weather and trail conditions from the national park's Back Country Office, (520) 638-7875, 1 to 5 p.m. local time, Monday to Friday. A serious fire forced the closure of the North Rim of the park last week; for updates, call (520) 638-7922 or see www.nps.gov/grca/fire.</p>
        <p>Learning About Okinawa</p>
        <p>Q. I want to take a grandniece to Okinawa, where she was born, but haven't been able to get tourist information around here. Can you help? -- Ruth W. Cupp, Charleston, S.C.</p>
        <p>A. A spokeswoman for the Japan National Tourist Organization in New York, Marian Goldberg, said her organization offers information about Okinawa. Write to the J.N.T.O., 1 Rockefeller Plaza, Suite 1250, New York, N.Y. 10020, or call (212) 757-5640, or fax (212) 307-6754.</p>
        <p>The group's Web site www.jnto .go.jp/regions/okinawa, in particular, offers a good introduction to Okinawa. This prefecture of 57 islands (17 uninhabited) has a subtropical climate that sustains more than 3,000 varieties of plants and reefs with 260 species of coral.</p>
        <p>Okinawa Island, the largest, is a two-and-a-half-hour flight from Tokyo and culturally quite different from the rest of Japan. The main city, Naha, is perhaps the most modern architecturally in Japan, a result of the destruction from American bombings in World War II.</p>
        <p>J.N.T.O also has information on Japan at www.japantravelinfo.com.</p>
