        <p>When Rick A. Lazio, the newly anointed Republican candidate for United States Senate, strode out onto a podium here this afternoon in the gym at his alma mater, West Islip High School, all the trappings of a campaign kickoff were in place.</p>
        <p>Fewer than 24 hours had passed since the Republican Party's first choice, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, had announced that he was dropping out of the race, giving Mr. Lazio, a congressman from Long Island, the chance to jump into the race. But the bleachers in the gym here were already festooned with red, white and blue balloons, ''Lazio for Senate'' banners were hanging from the basketball hoops, a disc jockey was playing ''Eye of the Tiger,'' and several hundred supporters had turned out to chant ''Lazio! Lazio!''</p>
        <p>It was a campaign that went from zero to 60 miles per hour overnight, or maybe it was more like from 5 to 55, since a small campaign staff had already been quietly laying the groundwork for the race and, even by today, things were not quite running at full throttle yet.</p>
        <p>Putting it in place in less than 24 hours was no easy task. Aides worked at Mr. Lazio's Bay Shore campaign headquarters until 4 a.m., and some returned shortly after 6 to continue. There were signs to print, a kickoff rally to arrange, a speech to polish, and seven cartons of T-shirts to print up with the words ''Lazio for Senate'' on the front and ''Made in New York'' across the back. ''Luckily this is New York, so you can get things done in the middle of the night,'' said one campaign worker  from Virginia.</p>
        <p>Then there were the volunteers to call in, hotel rooms to book, people to pick up at the airports. ''We had to call every official on Long Island to invite them here today,'' another aide recalled. ''We woke up most of them, because we didn't even begin calling until 10:30 or 11.''</p>
        <p>Still, the Lazio campaign was not exactly starting from scratch. Some of the spade work was done over the summer, when Mr. Lazio was still considering a race to challenge Mr. Giuliani for the Republican nomination. There were e-mail lists, reporters' telephone numbers and lists of volunteers and contributors that were compiled then that were all ready to go. Many of the old banners and signs had to be dusted off.</p>
        <p>And a small band of campaign professionals had come to Long Island earlier in the week to begin laying the groundwork for a Lazio race just in case Mayor Giuliani dropped out. Many of them grew convinced as the week wore on that they were wasting their time, especially after the mayor appeared on a nationally televised interview on Thursday in which he sounded every inch a candidate. Some were even getting ready to go home.</p>
        <p>''After I saw the mayor on television on Thursday night, I thought, that's it, I guess I can go to bed early tonight,'' said Ken Trepeta, a volunteer who had spent much of the week feverishly working on the campaign's Web site, www.lazio.com, which had been off-line and had not been updated since Mr. Lazio dropped out of the race to make room for Mr. Giuliani in August.</p>
        <p>Then, on Friday, the bombshell hit. It was time to get the campaign back on track, and quick. Some things were still pretty bumpy: there was no press secretary hired for the campaign yet, and many of the reporters assembled here were grumbling that no one was returning their calls.</p>
        <p>Volunteers got the word in different ways. ''I was watching my soaps, when it came on,'' said Loretta Lupo Howe, a longtime supporter. Vincent Gandolfo, a fellow volunteer, was driving in his car when he heard the news on the radio. ''I made a U-turn and pulled into a friend's restaurant, then got ready to work,'' he said.  Today they both pulled freshly minted Lazio T-shirts out of cartons and handed them to supporters.</p>
        <p>The call for dozens of red, white and blue balloons and floral arrangements did not go out until 9:15 a.m., no easy feat in the middle of graduation, confirmation, junior prom and prom season. ''I dropped everything, called my wife up and told her to bring in the children,'' said a local florist, Charles Piazza, 40, the owner of Flowers by Chazz, who showed up with 150 balloons. ''Rick has been a customer for years.''</p>
        <p>His daughter Natalie, 10, helped tie the balloons to little white baskets evenly spaced along the bleachers behind Mr. Lazio's podium. ''I tied most of them,'' she said, taking a deep breath in a gymnasium full of carpenters hastily building platforms for photographers and hanging signs.</p>
        <p>It was exactly the kind of old-fashioned, pep rally campaign announcement that Mayor Giuliani had resisted making. And if it was not as high-tech as the announcement by  Hillary Rodham Clinton -- there were no emotional video biographies, no nationally known Republican leaders to offer support -- it did have a kind of homespun feel. The traditional introduction of Mr. Lazio as ''the next United States senator from New York'' was made by Joan Johnson, the Republican Islip town clerk, who announced him when he ran for Congress in 1992.</p>
        <p>Lazio campaign workers were not the only ones who got quickly off the mark. As the speech was ending, a campaign worker for Mrs. Clinton was there among the reporters, passing out a news release that labeled Mr. Lazio a ''Gingrich Republican.''</p>
