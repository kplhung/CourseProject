        <p>CASUALLY dressed in a crisp royal blue button-down shirt on a sunny Saturday morning in the newly renovated kitchen of his Hampstead townhouse, grinding his own coffee beans (around and around) by hand, Michael Blakemore hardly seemed the high-powered theater director who presided over two major Broadway hits this season.</p>
        <p>Similarly, in talking about the success of his two productions, which could not be more dissimilar -- Cole Porter's light confection ''Kiss Me, Kate'' and Michael Frayn's weighty new play about nuclear physics, ''Copenhagen'' -- Mr. Blakemore, who turns 72 next month, sounded merely pleased that the shows managed to find their way to Broadway within months of each other. ''It's lovely, it's terrific,'' he said. ''A very unexpected thing to happen to me at my age, so I'm very grateful.''</p>
        <p>He also seemed only mildly hopeful that each would be nominated for a Tony Award -- which they were just a few days later. (Between them, the productions have also won Drama Desk, Drama League, Drama Critics' Circle and Outer Critics Circle awards.) ''It's silly to take the awards seriously -- they're really just a means of show biz advertising itself,'' Mr. Blakemore said, settling in with his coffee on a couch in the home he shares with his wife, Tonya McAllin, a stage designer, and their two teenage girls (he also has a son, 38, from his first marriage). ''Imagine if dentists gave themselves a Tony. It would be something like, the Tony for the Best Root Canal in the Most Hysterical Woman Over 50.''</p>
        <p>''I'd love to win,'' he continued (he hasn't before). ''But I am not going to get upset if I don't -- or I shall try not to.''</p>
        <p>It is this low-key, unassuming quality that people who have worked closely with Mr. Blakemore believe helps make him such a strong director. They say he is authoritative without being strident; that because he doesn't blow his top, other people working on his shows don't either.</p>
        <p>''He makes it seem easy,'' said Blair Brown, one of the three actors in ''Copenhagen.''  ''He makes you feel calm and safe.''</p>
        <p>Given Mr. Blakemore's even keel and elegant bearing, one cannot help wondering whether there is any mess to the man's otherwise apparently ordered life.</p>
        <p>''He is a reserved man,'' said Marin Mazzie, who stars in ''Kiss Me, Kate.''  ''He's not loud, he doesn't scream, but he has a great energy about him. There is an intensity and a fierceness in those eyes.''</p>
        <p>To understand the complexity of Mr. Blakemore, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Ms. Mazzie's co-star, said, one need only look at the director's body of work -- particularly this season's two productions. ''It's miraculous that both of these came from the same director,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''That says more about Michael Blakemore than anything else.''</p>
        <p>The British director Sir Trevor Nunn, who has known Mr. Blakemore for years and first produced ''Copenhagen'' at the Royal National Theater in London in 1998, said Mr. Blakemore's unflappable aura was deliberate. ''Michael likes to disguise his passion,'' Sir Trevor said. ''He's very passionate but he doesn't like too many people to know it, so he goes wonderfully impenetrable, he goes sphinxlike when you know there's a raging passion inside him.''</p>
        <p>Actors speak of Mr. Blakemore in respectful terms, as a father figure, an elder statesman, a wise leader with a dry, self-deprecating sense of humor who inspires loyalty and fondness. ''He comes just before a generation of British directors who are starry in their own right,'' said Michael Cumpsty, who is in ''Copenhagen.''  ''He doesn't seem to have a compelling need to exert his own ego. As a result, he commands a tremendous amount of affection. Nobody questions his ability or authority.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cumpsty said Mr. Blakemore's paternal quality resonated particularly well with ''Copenhagen,'' which deals with the father-son relationship between Niels Bohr, the Danish atomic physicist, and his German pupil, Werner Heisenberg, the author of the uncertainty principle. ''It's been a fascinating experience for me because I don't have a close relationship with my family,'' said Mr. Cumpsty, who plays Heisenberg.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blakemore had something of a strained relationship with his own father, an eye surgeon, who was disappointed that his son flunked out of medical school in his native Australia and became an actor.</p>
        <p>Before he became a director, Mr. Blakemore worked onstage for 15 years, including a season in 1959 at Stratford-on-Avon, playing supporting roles to legends like Charles Laughton, Laurence Olivier, Paul Robeson and Edith Evans. Ultimately, he decided he preferred being behind the scenes. ''I was very dissatisfied,'' he said. ''I couldn't stand being at the mercy of other people's estimates of you.''</p>
        <p>What he really wanted to do, he said, was direct, but it was almost impossible to break in because Oxford-educated directors had a lock on London theater. When he was 37, a friend who was running the Glasgow Citizens Theater asked him to direct three plays. He went on to become associate director of the theater, where he directed ''A Day in the Death of Joe Egg.'' The acclaimed play by Peter Nichols, about bringing up a handicapped child, moved to London and then to Broadway. ''So within 18 months of being a director,'' Mr. Blakemore said, ''I had a show on Broadway.''</p>
        <p>He has since directed such Broadway shows as Mr. Frayn's door-slamming farce ''Noises Off'' and the Cy Coleman musicals ''City of Angels'' and ''The Life.'' In Britain, he was an associate director at the National for five years under Olivier and then for two years under Sir Peter Hall, with whom he parted ways over how to run the theater. He has directed 20 successful productions in London's West End.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blakemore said he had a special place in his heart for ''City of Angels,'' which opened on Broadway in 1989. ''Of all the things I've done, I have a greater fervor on its behalf,'' he said, ''because we did it against enormous skepticism and pushed it through.''</p>
        <p>''Sometimes you get the script and it's self-evident how it should be done,'' he added. ''But other scripts come along where you have a contribution to make, where you know that if you hadn't done it, it wouldn't be like it is. I had some bright ideas on 'City of Angels.' '' Chief among these, Mr. Blakemore said, was the show's screenplay-within-a-play and its scenic shifts between color and black and white.</p>
        <p>Equal to his passion for directing, Mr. Blakemore said, is his interest in writing -- a pursuit he finds more difficult but ultimately more satisfying, because it is less ephemeral. His novel, ''Next Season,'' based on his acting experiences, was published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1968 and reissued by Applause Books in 1995. He has also written several articles -- like the one published in The New Yorker in 1996, ''Death Defying Director,'' about directing ''Death Defying Acts,'' a program of one-act plays by David Mamet, Elaine May and Woody Allen, at the Off Broadway Variety Arts Theater in 1995.</p>
        <p>He said he hoped to find time to finish the memoir he started 10 years ago, which describes his arrival in England in 1950. Because it took him so long to get to it, Mr. Blakemore said, he paid back his advance to his publisher, Penguin Books.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Blakemore comes to a show with a clear idea of what he wants, his collaborators say he seems to welcome their ideas, even if they differ from his own. ''I could struggle with him,'' Mr. Cumpsty said. ''He was amazingly generous about allowing me to test him, allowing me fairly wide boundaries and encouraging my exploration -- even if it became contentious -- rather than forcing me to accept a predigested solution.''</p>
        <p>Kathleen Marshall, who choreographed ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' said Mr. Blakemore had an apologetic way of offering his responses to a dance number. ''He would always preface everything by saying, 'I don't know anything about musical theater, but you might want to think about. . . .' '' she said. ''And everything he said was useful.''</p>
        <p>MR. BLAKEMORE also seems to savor the substance of what he is working on. He had seen the original ''Kiss Me, Kate'' and loved it. And, having already directed six Frayn plays, he speaks of ''Copenhagen'' with the fervor of a true fan. ''The exciting thing, and why it works with an audience in spite of being forbidding on the page, is the human story of the rivalry and competition and jealousy, which any member of the audience can understand,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Because ''Copenhagen'' is full of intricate language, the actors said it was the most difficult play they had ever had to memorize. ''It's 2 hours and 20 minutes nonstop,'' said Philip Bosco, who plays Bohr. ''If your concentration falters at all, you pay the price.''</p>
        <p>The play depends on clarity, the actors said, and Mr. Blakemore hammered the point home during rehearsals. ''When talking about the science, you have got to be letter perfect,'' Mr. Bosco said. ''The audience has to believe that you believe it; your credibility as scientists must be beyond reproach.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bosco said he was initially wary of agreeing to do ''Copenhagen,'' but Mr. Blakemore's faith in the project turned him around. ''I realized it was something of importance, but I said, 'I don't think people are going to sit through this,' '' Mr. Bosco recalled. ''Michael said: 'You must trust me. This works.' He was absolutely right.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blakemore knew that it worked because it had been successful in London, where he directed an eight-month run at the National, after which it transferred to the West End, where it is still playing after more than a year. He also mounted a successful production in Paris that is now touring France.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brown said that Mr. Blakemore only eventually came to accept the Broadway cast's emotional approach to ''Copenhagen,'' in contrast to the London cast's more detached delivery. ''Initially, Michael was urging us to be cooler and more reserved,'' she said. ''And we couldn't help it. We're a different breed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blakemore said he worried about how Broadway audiences would receive such a production, and he added that he was surprised the producers were willing to risk it. ''It's very heartening for Broadway that a play of this difficulty and seriousness can fill a Shubert theater,'' he said. ''The heroes of this undertaking are really these American producers flying in the face of common sense.''</p>
        <p>So far, the gamble looks as if it might pay off. The critics almost uniformly had high praise for the play, which opened on April 11 at the Royale Theater. Writing in The New York Times, Ben Brantley called it ''the most invigorating and ingenious play of ideas in many a year and a work of art that humanizes physics in a way no other has done.''</p>
        <p>There was some reluctance of a different sort about attempting ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' which opened at the Martin Beck Theater last fall. Mr. Mitchell, the actor, said he was initially not a great fan of the show, and that its old-fashioned quality was unfamiliar territory. ''I had reservations,'' he said. ''I thought the script lacked heart.'' He said he later realized that what he thought was missing from the text was actually already there, something Mr. Blakemore pointed out to him in private conversations and had clearly known all along.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blakemore said he hesitated before accepting the project also, for different reasons. ''I was a little reluctant because I'd seen it and I'd seen it done wonderfully,'' he said. ''I wondered, 'What can I do with this that hasn't already been done?' ''</p>
        <p>Aside from some subtle tinkering -- most notably starting the show with the song ''Another Openin', Another Show'' and altering one of the supporting roles, changes implemented with the help of the playwright John Guare -- Mr. Blakemore honored the original spirit of the show and was rewarded for it with rave reviews. Mr. Brantley wrote in The Times: ''The director Michael Blakemore and the choreographer Kathleen Marshall have shaped a show that is broad, brazen, often shameless and finally irresistible.''</p>
        <p>On June 4, the Tony Awards will reveal whether the theater community at large considered ''Kiss Me, Kate'' the season's best musical revival. It has stiff competition in Susan Stroman's staging of Meredith Willson's ''Music Man,'' which opened last month.</p>
        <p>Similarly, ''Copenhagen'' is facing tough contenders for best play, including Sam Shepard's ''True West,'' Claudia Shear's ''Dirty Blonde'' and Arthur Miller's ''Ride Down Mt. Morgan.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blakemore has been here before -- in 1990, when ''City of Angels'' was up for best musical and ''Lettice and Lovage'' for best play. He cannot help but hope things will turn out differently this time -- though of course he would not confess as much.</p>
        <p>''I'm obviously delighted,'' he said when asked in a subsequent conversation how it felt to learn of the nominations. He then added, with typical self-effacing humor, ''But I contained my excitement and steeled myself for disappointment.''</p>
