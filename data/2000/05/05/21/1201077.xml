        <p>FROM the air, Westchester bears a striking resemblance to England's Lake District, its wooded hills mottled with still ponds and shimmering lakes.</p>
        <p>From the ground, however, those bodies of water can be elusive. The largest ones -- the oblong reservoirs that supply New York City with its drinking water -- are accessible only to licensed fishermen with rowboats registered with the city. Several others are in town parks and are enjoyed by local residents only. And a few, including the expansive Lake Waccabuc in northeastern Westchester, are entirely off limits to the public, surrounded by private property.</p>
        <p>Happily, there are welcome signs at a handful of lakes nestled in parks and nature sanctuaries.</p>
        <p>Poring over a detailed map of Westchester and making a flurry of calls to park departments and private preserves, I emerged with a list of five lakes, each with different attributes. Four I explored on foot; one I canoed. Collectively, they yielded lovely surprises: a beaver paddling determinedly to shore, a lake's ever-shifting palette of earth and sky. For the nature lover with a poor sense of direction, lakeside trails are ideal. At any fork in the trail, you simply choose the one that keeps you close to the water.</p>
        <p>There were, to be sure, occasional reminders of civilization -- the distant hum of car traffic or the ungainly presence of high-tension wires. But these parks and preserves still left me feeling restored, as though for an hour or two I had slipped away to the Adirondacks.</p>
        <p>Cranberry Lake Preserve</p>
        <p>A county wildlife sanctuary in North White Plains, Cranberry Lake Preserve is a vest-pocket wilderness, eschewing recreation of any kind. Forget about picnicking, swimming or boating. You cannot even walk a dog here. Nature's wonders take center stage, with Cranberry Lake the star; the 165-acre preserve is an ideal place for a meditative walk.</p>
        <p>Driving into the preserve, I was struck by the number of rocks and boulders studding the earth, more plentiful, it seemed, than trees. Deeper into the sanctuary, the rocks were piled into neat stone walls that laced the woods -- vestiges of the park's agricultural past.</p>
        <p>From the small parking lot, a wide gravel path, about eight feet across, meandered toward the lake through the woods, a discreet but clear sign pointing the way.</p>
        <p>Bordering the trail were occasional fallen trees, embedded in a carpet of last fall's leaves. Within 10 minutes, I arrived at the lake. A soft rain began to fall, etching circles on the water's surface and blurring the reflections of trees on the opposite bank. The sound of traffic faded, leaving only the rattle of a red-wing blackbird and the whine of a blue jay.</p>
        <p>Mesmerized by the virgin landscape, I ventured on. The trail climbed suddenly, running about 20 feet above the lake before heading into a marshy area thick with lily pads.</p>
        <p>A boardwalk briefly appeared as the path crossed a stream and then a bog, and a chipmunk skittered across my path. A large stone cave loomed on my left, which I later learned was a root cellar from the old farm.</p>
        <p>The trail continued, past a profusion of skunk cabbage, toward South Pond, which is smaller than Cranberry Lake. From there I spied a beguiling waterfall in the distance. The drizzle had turned to rain. But umbrella in hand, I reached what the map calls the Cascade and admired the coursing water over moss-covered rocks.</p>
        <p>Wampus Pond Park</p>
        <p>The first thing you notice about Wampus Pond, which occupies most of this 94-acre county park, is its setting on busy, noisy Route 128 in Armonk. There are no houses or stores in sight, but the whir of cars is constant. The second thing you notice is more pleasing: the pond's color. It is the mysterious, earthy brown evocative of the cedar-tinted lakes of sleep-away camps.</p>
        <p>Unlike Cranberry Lake, Wampus Pond is not a place for hiking. There is a small expanse of bank near the parking lot, which is penetrable by foot. But the rest of the pond is bordered by dense trees, vegetation and rocks that rise up all around, providing a scenic backdrop and that marvelous color.</p>
        <p>What Wampus Pond does lend itself to is boating, and in its wisdom, the county rents rowboats to the public from a rustic boathouse on weekends from Memorial Day to Labor Day. (Privately owned rowboats and canoes are not allowed.) I visited the pond in early May, but I could see that the tranquil surface would allow a gentle spin.</p>
        <p>Unable to hike or boat, I scanned the pond with a pair of binoculars I had remembered to bring, hoping for a good specimen. My only catch was a quartet of Canada geese and a pair of mallards. Heading back to my car, a bit dejected, I turned one last time toward the water and there, only 10 feet from shore, was a beaver, propelling itself toward a floating dock. I ran back and trained my binoculars on the creature, seeing its face in fabulous detail -- the pointy nose and fierce little eyes. In seconds, it took cover under the dock. I waited and waited, but it stayed put.</p>
        <p>Franklin D. Roosevelt State Park</p>
        <p>This sprawling state park in northern Westchester also offers boating opportunities, with a lot more elbow room. There is 100-acre Mohansic Lake and 30-acre Crom Pond, and the two are connected by a lush, quiet ''water trail,'' which resembles the Louisiana Bayou.</p>
        <p>The 952-acre park in Yorktown Heights, right off the Taconic Parkway, rents rowboats, but park officials also let visitors bring in their own boats, as long as they are not gas powered. Boat owners simply need to stop by the park office to obtain a $15 permit, which is honored at other state parks in the Taconic region. Since my husband and I have a canoe, we were delighted to be able to take it out on a Monday in advance of the daily boat rental season.</p>
        <p>This is a heavy recreation park, with a giant swimming pool, a soccer field, concession stands and several parking lots. But none of those facilities are visible from the water. And while hiking trails snake through the park's forested northeastern section, no trail circles the lake or pond, giving boaters the feeling of having left humanity behind.</p>
        <p>A boat launch is at the northern end of Mohansic Lake, not far from the water trail. The wind picked up just as we pushed off, and we were dismayed that we could see cars zipping by on the Taconic at the lake's far end. So we paddled toward the protected water trail, or connector, and, we hoped, a less blustery Crom Pond. The waterway, 10 to 20 feet across, wended through a thicket of shrubs and trees. The dull roar of the Taconic diminished with each stroke.</p>
        <p>As we nosed our canoe into Crom Pond, we spotted a smattering of Canada geese and a lone rowboat in the distance. Here, too, the wind swept across the water in gusts, which made paddling a challenge. We pulled ashore and had a picnic lunch of ham and cheddar cheese sandwiches. Since this park has a ''carry in-carry home'' policy for trash, we carefully packed up our wrappings and, for good measure, gathered refuse left by past picnickers. We then canoed some more, the wind blessedly at our backs.</p>
        <p>Rockefeller State Park Preserve</p>
        <p>Unlike Franklin D. Roosevelt State Park, this state preserve, which straddles Sleepy Hollow and Mount Pleasant, is intended for the quieter pursuits of hiking, jogging, photography and nature study. There is certainly much to study, especially around Swan Lake, which on a recent afternoon teemed with wildlife.</p>
        <p>The 1.3-mile trail, which runs the lake's periphery, is wide and flat, making for an easy stroll. A former carriage road on land belonging to the Rockefeller family, the lakeside trail is one of 20 miles of carriage paths that cross through meadows, woods and streams. Since 1983, family members have given through deed or easement 1,066 acres of their estate to the state to safeguard what John D. Rockefeller Sr. described in 1908 as ''the beautiful views, the trees and fine landscape effects of that very interesting section of the Hudson River.''</p>
        <p>Within minutes of entering the preserve, I saw a rabbit and a number of birds: grackles, finches, cowbirds, titmice and robins. As I turned onto the lakeside trail, I spotted an egret standing stock still across the water.</p>
        <p>Soon I came across three fuzzy goslings chaperoned by a Canada goose, which hissed as I passed. Every rock seemed to have a turtle or two; one rock looked vaguely creepy, with 18 turtles on a single side. This was Westchester's version of ''Wild Kingdom,'' I thought, and there was no traffic noise or overhead wires to spoil the show.</p>
        <p>I rounded the southern tip of the lake where the trail briefly veers away from the water and cuts through a rocky embankment. Joggers and dog walkers passed me. Coming back to the lake, I inadvertently startled the egret, which fled majestically to the far shore. From here I could make out a cormorant on the lake, its hooked beak tilted characteristically skyward. Nearing the end, I paused where a trail called Deer Run connects with the Swan Lake Trail, in an area of wetlands and woods. In a period of minutes, I witnessed a red-tailed hawk being chased by crows and a chipmunk rustling in the leaves. There was a flash of yellow in a tree: an American goldfinch. I turned around in time to watch a deer as it silently crossed -- what else? -- Deer Run.</p>
        <p>Teatown Lake Reservation</p>
        <p>Big, off the beaten path and far from airports and highways, this privately owned nature preserve in Ossining is rugged, pristine and absolutely silent. If not for the high-tension wires that unfortunately cross right over Teatown Lake, you could easily imagine yourself in another time.</p>
        <p>The 730-acre reservation, which runs extensive nature education programs, is named for the large, pork-chop-shaped lake, which was formed in 1923 when the landowner at the time dammed a stream. As farming slowly died out, the surrounding land reverted to forest, and the stone walls that once marked the edges of fields are still present.</p>
        <p>Visitors can choose from a dozen trails, but the 2.3-mile Lakeside Trail offers a variety of vistas, clinging to the shoreline much of the time but also venturing off into boulder-strewn woods. (The staff at the preserve periodically leads visitors on canoe outings throughout the year.)</p>
        <p>I pulled into the preserve late in the day, but there was still plenty of sun in the sky. As I moved steadily along the trail, I sensed the presence of wildlife without actually seeing any: the splash of a fish, the groan of a frog.</p>
        <p>It did not help that I had to keep my eyes fixed on the trail, which was rutted with tree roots. But the trail was well marked by blue disks on trees, and rustic benches appeared every so often. My favorite discovery was a small wood bridge spanning a gushing brook, reached by making a five-minute detour onto the Northwest Trail near a small dam at the lake's northern corner.</p>
        <p>Later the Lakeside Trail ascended steeply in two spots through woods and then ended abruptly at Spring Valley Road, a temporary inconvenience caused by reconstruction of a wood bridge.</p>
        <p>Just as I was grumpily thinking I had to take a paved road back to the nature center's parking lot, I spotted a beaver in a marsh across the street -- my second in as many days. It paddled past two mallards and disappeared in a drainage pipe running under the road. Within minutes I was able to pick up the Lakeside Trail again. As the setting sun cast an orangy glow across the lake, I hiked past the winsomely named Wildflower Island and on through a grove of Norway spruces. Reluctantly, I reached the parking lot.</p>
