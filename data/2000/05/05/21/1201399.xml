        <p>Two weeks after he won the Kentucky Derby for his fifth straight score, Fusaichi Pegasus suffered an improbable upset today when he was outrun by Red Bullet by 3 3/4 lengths in the homestretch of the Preakness.</p>
        <p>The colt who carries the name of the flying horse of Greek mythology was the overwhelming 1-5 favorite, apparently poised to give one more legendary performance despite a heavy track at Pimlico Race Course. But he got hooked by Red Bullet around the turn before an astonished crowd of 98,304 spectators, and he did not prevail.</p>
        <p>At the finish, Red Bullet, who lost the Wood Memorial to Fusaichi Pegasus last month by 4 1/4  lengths, worked his revenge while Pegasus held second place by the length of his head over Impeachment, with Captain Steve fourth.</p>
        <p>So, for the 22nd consecutive year, since Affirmed in 1978, racing was denied its ultimate prize: the Triple Crown. It was denied to a colt who cost $4 million as a yearling and whose royal pedigree lists Mr. Prospector as sire and Danzig as grandsire.</p>
        <p>For the first time in recent memory, no colt seemed more capable of achieving greatness than Fusaichi Pegasus. And for the first time since Deputed Testamony in 1983, a horse who did not race in the Kentucky Derby won the Preakness.</p>
        <p>''He couldn't handle the track,'' said Neil Drysdale, the English trainer for Fusaichi Pegasus, who became racing's newest and most brilliant star this year. ''It was a greasy kind of track, and he just couldn't go with it. He was squeezed a bit, but I don't think that hurt his chances at all. I think he just couldn't handle the track.''</p>
        <p>Frank Stronach, the Canadian executive who has been buying racetracks in this country and become perhaps the most powerful figure in the sport, remembered that his horse Touch Gold had upset a Triple Crown candidate three years ago. After a rough-and-tumble trip in the Preakness, the colt came back to win the Belmont Stakes, denying the Triple Crown to Silver Charm in the final strides. Now, Stronach watched his Red Bullet come back from the Wood, his only defeat in four starts, to upset somebody else's dream. And so, for the first time in four years, the Triple Crown will not be on the line in the Belmont Stakes on June 10.</p>
        <p>''Pegasus is a great horse,'' he said, ''and so is Red Bullet. I don't enjoy spoiling somebody else's plans. But we decided after the Wood to give Red Bullet a rest, skip the Derby and have another shot at Pegasus in the Preakness. It's all in the stars.''</p>
        <p>Joe Orseno, who trains Red Bullet, said he would take a few days to check his colt before deciding whether he would run in the Belmont. ''Believe me,'' he said, ''this horse will tell us what to do.''</p>
        <p>Jerry Bailey, riding Red Bullet for only the second time, said he sensed a duel taking shape as the field of eight turned for home. ''So, I took him a bit wide in the hope that Pegasus would have to go wider. And that's exactly what happened. Red Bullet is a highly talented horse, and he showed it.''</p>
        <p>For Kent Desormeaux, who rode Fusaichi Pegasus to fame in his five straight victories, the 125th Preakness ended a run of remarkable success.</p>
        <p>In the last two weeks alone, the jockey won the Kentucky Derby, the Pimlico Special and the Black-Eyed Susan for fillies. But it all came unraveled in the Preakness.</p>
        <p>''The track was a little greasy, and we got squeezed coming out of the starting gate,'' he said. ''But Red Bullet and I were right together all the way down the backside. We pushed the button at the same time, but Red Bullet had a bigger button. He just ran wild. Today was their day.''</p>
        <p>It took nearly one mile for the confrontation to take shape. Red Bullet was running sixth much of the way, and Fusaichi Pegasus was a step ahead of him in fifth. Both were stalking the long shot Hugh Hefner, who eventually wilted to sixth place, and High Yield, the star of the D. Wayne Lukas stable who faded to 15th in the Derby and faded to seventh in the Preakness. And Hal's Hope helped them make the pace before he dropped to eighth and last place.</p>
        <p>Then they turned into the homestretch, and this was the time for Fusaichi Pegasus to fly. Instead, Red Bullet outran him relentlessly and crossed the wire nearly 4 lengths in front.</p>
        <p>Red Bullet ran the mile and three-sixteenths in 1:56 flat, returned $14.40 for a $2 bet to win and earned $650,000 of the purse of $1 million. The track was sloppy all morning on a cold and rainy day, but gradually improved during the afternoon until it was labeled good by the time of the Preakness, one notch below fast.</p>
        <p>Impeachment, a closer who finished third in the Derby, made another of his long rallies from eighth place to sixth in the homestretch and finally to third, a head behind Fusaichi Pegasus and a neck in front of Captain Steve.</p>
        <p>Impeachment's jockey, Craig Perret, reported: ''I thought he was home at the quarter pole. He kicked in and he really came on. It turned out that he was just the third-best horse.''</p>
        <p>The trainer Bob Baffert, who won two of the last three runnings of the Preakness, said Captain Steve ''didn't run all that badly.'' But he added: ''This is really too far for him. And it was a heavy track, but he did his best.''</p>
        <p>Lukas, who saw High Yield run another dull race, put it this way: ''It was a demanding, competitive race on a demanding racetrack. Pat Day had the horse perfectly placed. But the horse just didn't have it. Going into the race, I felt as good about his chances as I did before the Derby. But a fresh horse who didn't run in the Derby won today.''</p>
        <p>And Harold Rose, the 88-year-old owner and trainer of Hal's Hope, the winner of the Florida Derby and once the hero of the 3-year-old class, agreed with his jockey Roger Velez, who said: ''He's a tired horse. He has a lot of nicks, and he needs a little time. We'll freshen him up, and start again later.''</p>
