        <p>A group of subdued Knicks slumped through a hotel lobby today with the slurred and languid motions of a phonograph on its last crank. The buzz from Friday night's 18-point deficit escape by this adversity-inspired team was long gone; the euphoria had petered out.</p>
        <p>There was a team that looked drained by the mental and physical fatigue of a second-round series dedicated to tension junkies. There were players left somber after finding out that Minnesota guard Malik Sealy had died early this morning in a car accident.</p>
        <p>It seemed it would be a struggle for them to muster some energy for the series-deciding Game 7 against the Miami Heat on Sunday, when a final curtain will fall on one of these two rivals.</p>
        <p>''This is it,'' Latrell Sprewell said. ''It has been so hard fought, so intense on every possession, it's a shame someone's season has to end tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Two years in a row, the Knicks have defied logic by coming up with a way to usher Coach Pat Riley into a summer filled with night sweats after ending the Heat's season in Miami. After what unfolded in Game 6, the Heat might be wondering: is it happening again? But Coach Jeff Van Gundy dismissed any notion that the Heat's devastation on Friday night would carry over to Game 7. And because of the past, he shrugged off any theory about his team's edge in momentum.</p>
        <p>''Going into this, we knew it would be hard fought, and the likelihood was that it would go the distance,'' Van Gundy said after his team walked through a practice today. ''We knew coming in the series we'd most likely have to win two games on the road. And that's where we're at.''</p>
        <p>The idea of closing out the Heat in Miami must percolate in the soul of the Knicks. It must stoke the kind of fire Patrick Ewing revealed as he soared in for 18 rebounds over his 42-minute night in Game 6 while still having enough left to deliver impact plays down the stretch.</p>
        <p>''To come this far and lose on Sunday, that's not what this is all about,'' said Ewing, who, if the Knicks lose, might have his best last chance at a title behind him. ''We're playing Game 7 with one goal: win.''</p>
        <p>The thought of advancing to the Eastern Conference finals against the Indiana Pacers must take the ache out of the left ankle that Allan Houston rolled midway through the fourth quarter on his way to a game-saving effort Friday night; and a victory would greatly lessen the sting he has felt from the critics wondering why he was not able to extricate himself from Dan Majerle's defense before Game 6.</p>
        <p>''I don't listen to what people say,'' said Houston, who added that his sore ankle would not prevent him from playing. ''I just keep looking ahead. One game is not going to determine one's character.''</p>
        <p>But one Game 7 loss would end the Knicks' season. The heft of that thought did not seem to register in the Knicks' distracted and weary demeanor today.</p>
        <p>''I hope our team -- and they're a little bit discombobulated after last night and also there's Sealy's death -- well, hopefully, by tomorrow they'll be excited, energetic and ready to go,'' Van Gundy said. ''I think we're a little tired right now. We had a late night -- plus mentally it's been a tough, long series -- but I also think, you know, players are very close. I think it's very difficult for players when something like this happens. In their eyes, they know what happened to Sealy could have happened to them. I think it's difficult, and I feel for them.''</p>
        <p>Still, there was a game plan and notes written on the pages in Van Gundy's hands. Once again, he emphasized rebounding. It was a huge factor in the outcome of Game 6, when the Knick guards ducked inside the paint for loose balls, and the big men boxed out their men for a 46-41 advantage.</p>
        <p>''I think we understand as a team that rebounding won the game,'' said Sprewell, who grabbed nine rebounds around the bulky Jamal Mashburn. ''It's a shame it took six games for us to do that, though. I think we've got the message now.''</p>
        <p>They also had a popular theory reinforced by Game 6: the Knicks can find a way out of any desperate situation. Nothing was more dire than an 18-point deficit just before the half.</p>
        <p>''We were very ready last night, but we confused being anxious with being aggressive,'' Van Gundy said. ''We played so poorly in the first half. And as we continued to play worse and worse, we got more down. I think in a deciding, ultimate game, the start is every bit as important as the finish.</p>
        <p>''Three years ago, when we played them in the ultimate game, we were down right away big, and lost. Two years ago we got up on them big, and we were able to withstand their run because of the cushion. Last year we were down, 21-8, and somehow we went on a 13-0 run. But that's really testing it. You don't want to be down. The same thing that plagued us last night plagued us in Game 5 early last year. Being anxious rather than aggressive in everything when it comes to turnovers and transition baskets. The start is every bit as important as the finish tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>Instead of reveling in Friday's Game 6 victory, KURT THOMAS continued to hurt his chances of being re-signed by the Knicks when he began grumbling about the spare playoff minutes Coach JEFF VAN GUNDY has given him. ''I haven't played in the second half the last two games,'' Thomas said. ''What the heck is he saving me for?'' Thomas has not exactly gained Van Gundy's trust. Thomas, who will become a free agent this summer, played four minutes, was 0 for 2, with one turnover and a technical foul. . . . The Knicks nearly signed Malik Sealy, who died in a head-on car crash outside Minneapolis on Saturday before dawn, to a $1 million league exception after the lockout ended two seasons ago. ''I think he got the same offer from Minnesota,'' Van Gundy said of Sealy, a native New Yorker who played college basketball at St. John's and who worked out with Knick players during the lockout. ''We were very up front with him. At that point, I think he was going to have a chance to play more with Minnesota.''</p>
