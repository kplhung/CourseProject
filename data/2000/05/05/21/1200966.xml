        <p>KRUPP'S LULU</p>
        <p>Stories.</p>
        <p>By Gordon Lish.</p>
        <p>Four Walls Eight Windows, $22.</p>
        <p>There are two sure-fire ways to read Gordon Lish with instant satisfaction: high on a legal or illegal ''substance,'' or deeply depressed, in a graduate student way, about the impasse of fiction and the impossibility of storytelling. Lish will then sound profoundly exciting. Otherwise, you need open-minded patience. He can't go on: he does go on. ''Good heavens, is it possible for a story to be told when what is in it are only words?'' he writes. It depends on what you mean by story. There are 16 story riffs in this new collection, if you count the 13 blank pages of ''Another Felonious Discharge of Sovereign Plenitude.'' In each, a narrator works up an obsessive rant about some small aspect of daily life: a scatter rug, a broken washer, the provenance of a heavy mug. The complaint works up to a little drama and then loses itself, falls apart in quibbles over definitions, the name of a thing, the description of a gesture, until narrator and reader find themselves knee-deep in a junkyard of verbal debris. And then there's the lint obsession: fishing it from the dryer and describing its gobby pliancy trumps food and sex as a highlight in ''The Positions.'' Elsewhere, Lish writes: ''So I says to the window-shade man, I says to him you see this window shade, this window shade's no good. . . . I need a new window shade, how about a new window shade'' and on through a dizzying number of ''window shade'' sentences. Like all the pieces, this one develops a voice, a distinctive rhythm, and then stops, shadeless and paralyzed. Sometimes Lish can sound like Samuel Beckett in Gertrude Stein drag. His avant-garde investigations are tired and nave. The French New Novelists exhausted the vein he's mining 30 years ago. But he's got his funny moments, and some stories are unexpectedly moving.</p>
