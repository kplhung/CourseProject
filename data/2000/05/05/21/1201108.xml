        <p>ALL year, they've been running errands, standing in lines, pounding  the floor in the gym and hardly seeing the light of day as they've gone from woolen socks and waterproof boots to padded slippers to soggy sneakers.</p>
        <p>But with the arrival of summer, they're getting excited about sandals and fresh air and barefoot walks on the beach.

        <p>ALL year, they've been running errands, standing in lines, pounding  the floor in the gym and hardly seeing the light of day as they've gone from woolen socks and waterproof boots to padded slippers to soggy sneakers.</p>
        <p>But with the arrival of summer, they're getting excited about sandals and fresh air and barefoot walks on the beach. They're nearly wriggling with anticipation of the warm sunshine and the dewy grass and the chance to lie exposed in a new pair of summer shoes or perhaps entirely naked.  Your feet are getting ready to make their appearance again -- or are they?</p>
        <p>From Toe to Brain</p>
        <p>Guilty of a winter of foot neglect myself, I decided to remedy the situation with a bit of pampering that started with a visit to the year-old Epidavros Day Spa in Mount Kisco, which offers a ''Spa Foot Treatment.''</p>
        <p>I began my indulgences with a half-hour session of Foot Reflexology ($40), a massage technique in which stress and  pain throughout the body are alleviated by thumb and finger pressure on reflex points in the foot that correspond to different organs in the body.</p>
        <p>''The big toes relate to the brain,'' explained Christina, my reflexologist. ''The other toes relate to the sinuses, and it pretty much goes down from there.''</p>
        <p>Relaxed and curious, I lay on my back in the darkened room, surrounded by the glow of orange lights and the recorded sounds of a distant thunderstorm.</p>
        <p>No one had ever manipulated my toes and kneaded my feet this way before, and when it was over, I was left reluctant to put them back on the floor.</p>
        <p>This was followed by an hourlong treatment ($50) that started with a whirlpool foot bath scented with eucalyptus and menthol, soothing enough in itself -- but just the beginning. Next was a peppermint foot peel, which included my entire calves. ''Does it itch?'' asked Mirland, as she rubbed my feet, and when I nodded yes, she told me, ''Good, it should.''</p>
        <p>After that, she wrapped my feet, covered now by a callus exfoliating mask, in pieces of cellophane, inserted them into toasty terry booties and after a few minutes, unwrapped them again and began scrubbing briskly with a pumice stone and a sandpaper-like scrubber. Dead skin was flying as my calluses were filed away.</p>
        <p>My feet were rinsed again, patted dry, then massaged first with foot oil, then gel and then cream, blending the smells of lavender, camphor and rosemary. Having my toenails painted was the icing, as I sat admiring my newly smooth and invigorated feet, vowing to make at least part of this a monthly routine and feeling sure I'd live longer if I did.</p>
        <p>Foot pampering treatments -- for women and men -- come in a range of prices. Epidavros uses Pevonia Botanica products, many of which are available for home use.</p>
        <p>Origins offers its own (well named, as usual) line of foot care, including ''Foot Rest'' foot soak, pungent with Australian  Eucalyptus and menthol; and ''Sole Searche'' foot scrub, with finely ground lava rock to slough away rough skin along with French peppermint, sandalwood, lemon rind and nutmeg for softening and a subtle but delicious scent. Finally, there's and  ''Step Lively'' foot cream made with rose hips and wintergreen, which, the label  explains, helps ''channel energy throughout your body, keeping you active all day long.''</p>
        <p>The Epidavros Day Spa is at 272 North Bedford Road in Mount Kisco; the telephone number is 244-4422.</p>
        <p>Hot to Trot In Thongs and Straps</p>
        <p>Such well-groomed feet have no intention of hiding, and this summer's shoe fashions make them easy to display. ''Look for lots of thongs and strappy numbers,'' said Heather Hested, East Coast fashion stylist for Nordstrom, ''open, flirty, feminine and fun.''</p>
        <p>And colorful, too, she added, citing purple, orange, kelly green and aqua blue as popular shoe tones this season. For women, there are ample python and ostrich prints, fabric shoes (from brightly colored canvas and shantung mules, to denim-inspired boots) and sundry costume jewels.</p>
        <p>''Women enjoy seeing jewels adorning their ankles and feet,'' Ms. Hested said.  Heels, she said, ''range from flat on the ground to three inches high, but delicate and feminine whatever you choose,'' and she described a silver-studded, pink suede, high-heeled mule as truly catching the fashion spirit.</p>
        <p>Such trends translate quickly to the younger markets, with python prints ''everywhere in our junior department,'' she said. ''There are python sandals with matching bags, and again, look for lots of bright colors.''</p>
        <p>Also hot this summer are raffia, beaded and embroidered shoes, in both wedge platforms and a more feminine, narrower cut, as well as a Western-style boot with a high heel, which is expected to be popular until it gets too hot to wear. Younger girls, too, will find shoes featuring criss-crossing leather and wraparound ankle straps in playful colors like hot pinks and purples.</p>
        <p>When it comes to color in men's shoes, Ms. Hested advises mahogany. ''It's a great summertime color, as is the range of browns,'' she said. ''Black, of course, is a staple, but burgundy is falling off.''</p>
        <p>As for styles, look for shoes without ties -- ''loafers for the more conservative, closed-toe slides for a modern look and woven leather sandlas,'' Ms. Hested said. ''We have a brown suede loafer-style shoe that is particularly hot.''</p>
        <p>Overall, this season's styles mix comfort with style, the only way to go in summer. Skechers is back, offering a range of chunky-soled, woven, brown leather sandals for men, women and children, sure to be seen pounding hot pavement everywhere. J. Crew is showing a spectrum of slides and thongs, some with Velcro closures, some in animal prints, others in beaded silk, and all in a range of colors. With shoes like these, feet can breathe easy.</p>
        <p>Adornment For Ankles and Toes</p>
        <p>With feet buffed and shoes revealing, toes and ankles are ready for special attention this summer.</p>
        <p>''Ostentation is in,'' Ms. Hested said. ''Gold is huge.'' She was talking about gold chain anklets, from thin to chunky, for ''that golddigger-esque look.''</p>
        <p>Those multicolored rows of beaded bracelets that garnished the wrists of all ages during the winter will show up closer to ground level on ankles and toes for summer.</p>
        <p>From light-catching Austrian crystals to tiny beads in color combinations to go with any outfit, elasticized anklets are easy --  and fun -- to wear and affordable enough that you can make your fashion statement with 10 or 15 if you choose, mixing and matching as the mood strikes.</p>
        <p>With toes being flaunted by strappy sandals, toe rings are hotter than ever. Unlike finger rings, toe rings are worn on the upper part of the toe, between the nail and the first joint, and should fit without pinching the toe.  The pillow of flesh around the nail keeps the ring in place with room to spare.</p>
        <p>Again, Ms. Hested said, gold is big; for that matter, so is silver.</p>
        <p>Beaded toe rings have also turned up, stretchy enough that you can switch from one toe to another, and inexpensive enough to be pure summer fun.</p>
