        <p>One day a few years ago, Anne Carullo -- 35, pregnant and in a state of permanent sleep-deprivation -- was commuting to her job in Manhattan from her home in Westchester. She took a seat on the train across the aisle from a woman who was maybe 20 and found herself staring at the woman's face, how the skin gave back light, how it glowed with translucent radiance. ''How come my skin doesn't do that?'' Carullo asked herself. If she had been a bond trader, she might have vowed to get more sleep or check into a day spa for a facial. But Carullo, who now holds the title of senior vice president for marketing and product development worldwide for Prescriptives, is obsessed with marrying technology to cosmetic needs. Her brain began churning over the question ''What can I put on my face to get it to look like that?'' It would be not a treatment, not a makeup, but a substance that would gather light and throw it back into the universe, just like the perfect, unblemished skin of the very young woman across the aisle.</p>
        <p>Spring 2000. Carullo, now mother to Louie, age 3 1/2, with a home in Manhattan (Battery Park City, where there's plenty of light), is about to oversee the launch of Phase 2 of Magic, a line of lotions, pencils and powders that reflect, deflect and scatter light, creating the illusion of the flawless skin of youth. Although her office is in Manhattan, she is paying one of her monthly visits to the Long Island laboratory of Prescriptives' parent company, Estee Lauder. Carullo -- baby blue eyes, full lips, cropped brown hair, with a voice straight from Mulberry Street, where she was reared -- walks the halls with the swagger of a cop on her favorite beat, greeting everyone she sees.</p>

        <p>One day a few years ago, Anne Carullo -- 35, pregnant and in a state of permanent sleep-deprivation -- was commuting to her job in Manhattan from her home in Westchester. She took a seat on the train across the aisle from a woman who was maybe 20 and found herself staring at the woman's face, how the skin gave back light, how it glowed with translucent radiance. ''How come my skin doesn't do that?'' Carullo asked herself. If she had been a bond trader, she might have vowed to get more sleep or check into a day spa for a facial. But Carullo, who now holds the title of senior vice president for marketing and product development worldwide for Prescriptives, is obsessed with marrying technology to cosmetic needs. Her brain began churning over the question ''What can I put on my face to get it to look like that?'' It would be not a treatment, not a makeup, but a substance that would gather light and throw it back into the universe, just like the perfect, unblemished skin of the very young woman across the aisle.</p>
        <p>Spring 2000. Carullo, now mother to Louie, age 3 1/2, with a home in Manhattan (Battery Park City, where there's plenty of light), is about to oversee the launch of Phase 2 of Magic, a line of lotions, pencils and powders that reflect, deflect and scatter light, creating the illusion of the flawless skin of youth. Although her office is in Manhattan, she is paying one of her monthly visits to the Long Island laboratory of Prescriptives' parent company, Estee Lauder. Carullo -- baby blue eyes, full lips, cropped brown hair, with a voice straight from Mulberry Street, where she was reared -- walks the halls with the swagger of a cop on her favorite beat, greeting everyone she sees.</p>
        <p>In fact, Carullo's husband, Louis, a neighborhood boy she met when she was 18, was a New York City policeman and now works in private security. Growing up with three older brothers, Carullo was not especially fascinated by makeup, but she did have a vision of herself as a woman with an office, good suits and a secretary. While working her way through N.Y.U. and F.I.T., where she graduated with a degree in marketing, she cheated shamelessly on a typing test and landed a job at Revlon. It was there that she found her calling, watching a pretty woman from product development come through the office testing mascara and lipstick on co-workers. ''I wanted to do that,'' recalls Carullo. When the position opened up, she applied and got it. From there Carullo went to L'Oreal and Max Factor before joining Estee Lauder eight years ago as part of a team that investigated how technologies outside the industry could be adapted to cosmetics. Five years ago she transferred to Prescriptives.</p>
        <p>In the lab, Carullo holds a crisp, new $20 bill up to the light. The 20 to the right of Andrew Jackson's face shimmers green to black, the effect of microscopic filters added to the ink, a technology developed to prevent would-be forgers from printing money with new high-resolution digital copiers. The shimmer cannot be reproduced two-dimensionally. Microprisms, a variation on the Treasury's technology, were taken up by automobile manufacturers, who added them to paint; the new-technology people at Estee Lauder discovered prisms at an auto show. The obvious application was nail shades and lip colors, but Carullo was after subtler effects: what about prisms that would hide blue shadows or brown spots, or brighten sallow skin?</p>
        <p>The first Magic products appeared in December: Illuminating Liquid Potion, Illuminating Cream Potion and Liquid Powder -- all colorless substances with light-diffusing particles. Cooling Wand, a 70 percent water stick with blue-reflecting particles, was for use around eyes to brighten and firm skin.</p>
        <p>A second round of products, making their debut this month, employ color-reflecting prisms for crayons that hide imperfections. Want to obliterate that blue vein right in the middle of your forehead? The Blue Neutralizer should do nicely. The Brown Neutralizer makes age spots vanish. The Red Neutralizer takes care of blemishes and broken capillaries. Skin-tone Concealers go on top. Two Highlighter crayons, white for fair skin, yellow for darker skin, draw light to certain areas, opening up eyes, slimming the nose, even lifting the jaw. Diffusion Liner, a pencil in fair, medium and dark, will reshape the lip or brow. There is also Liquid Powder in two tints: yellow to mute redness, reddish orange to neutralize ashiness, yellow to brighten all complexions.</p>
        <p>Now Carullo is looking into developing Body Magic, a reflecting lotion to conceal cellulite, obscure veins and make arms look more defined. Muscles in a jar!</p>
        <p>Closer to fruition is a foundation that makes the face appear bathed in candle glow. Carullo opens a sample and dabs some on the back of her hand. First she checks that it breaks evenly, then she judges ''play time,'' how long it takes to blend. Finally, she looks at drying time. This sample is still sticky: too much glycerine. What makes this formula difficult to achieve, she says, is that it must create an optical illusion and moisturize. Each added requirement complicates the mix.</p>
        <p>For this story to end properly, Carullo would be displaying a flawless, luminous complexion, just like the young woman's face she admired years ago on the train. Carullo, patting experimental polymer putty on her cheek, waves a dismissive hand. If she came to work with perfect makeup, how could she test the next new thing?</p>
