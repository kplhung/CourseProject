        <p>FIRST, the name. Funny, right? Cheri Oteri, a put-on, obviously, with that silly rhyme. Perfect for a ''Saturday Night Live'' comedian. ''Actually,'' Ms. Oteri said with a hint of embarrassment, ''it's short for Cheryl, and the last name is actually pronounced o-TEE-ree, so it doesn't rhyme at all.''</p>
        <p>O.K., not funny.</p>

        <p>FIRST, the name. Funny, right? Cheri Oteri, a put-on, obviously, with that silly rhyme. Perfect for a ''Saturday Night Live'' comedian. ''Actually,'' Ms. Oteri said with a hint of embarrassment, ''it's short for Cheryl, and the last name is actually pronounced o-TEE-ree, so it doesn't rhyme at all.''</p>
        <p>O.K., not funny.</p>
        <p>Then, there's the cat. Ms. Oteri makes much of how she regularly drags her to the cat groomer. Cat groomer? Isn't a big argument for having a feline that it grooms itself? Now, that's funny, right? Is Ms. Oteri so obsessed with appearances that she must have her cat perfectly coifed. There must be some routine with that one.</p>
        <p>''Well, actually,'' she explained on Wednesday, a couple of hours before the read-through for the final show of the season, there's a more practical reason. Ms. Oteri thinks it's more sanitary to keep the silky fur around the long-haired calico's, ahem, derriere, clipped short. ''Sorry,'' she said with a sweet smile, as the sun streamed into her small Upper West Side apartment. ''I guess it's not as funny as it sounds. It does look hilarious when they blow-dry her.''</p>
        <p>But that afternoon, Ms. Oteri couldn't even get the cat into the carrier to take her to the salon. Terrified at the sight of the dreaded bag, Stella had found a hole in the webbing beneath Ms. Oteri's mattress and hid amid the coils. Ms. Oteri tried everything from promising her caviar to outright begging her to come out, to no avail. With her single-girl apartment -- complete with exercise machine bought from an infomercial and a kitchen smaller than a slice of pie -- and all the obsessing about her cat, Ms. Oteri could be a new ''Saturday Night Live'' character: Jane Normal. ''I could squeeze her out by jumping on the bed,'' Ms. Oteri said, her voice soft and babyish. ''But that could crush her.''</p>
        <p>Besides, Ms. Oteri, whose recurring characters during her five years on ''Saturday Night Live'' have included a desperate cheerleader, an addled prescription drug addict and the cable sex show hostess Robin Byrd, was more inclined to empathize with her pet. ''I know how she feels,'' she said. ''I'm not that good in public either. I don't even go to parties.''</p>
        <p>Could this be a joke at last? A veteran of NBC's 25-year-old comedy boot camp worried about making a good impression? ''Totally -- guys don't come up to me,'' the five-foot-tall Ms. Oteri said, admitting that it's been years since she had a steady boyfriend. ''When I go to parties, there's a moment when I think, I really don't belong here.''</p>
        <p>Leave it to other late-night comics to perfect an off-stage persona drenched in personal style. John Belushi and Chris Farley powered through their brief lives in a bloated whirl and became models of self-destructive hedonism. With his modern art collection and New Yorker jottings, Steve Martin cultivated the urban sophisticate.  Janeane Garofalo became a belligerent poster girl for anti-cool.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Oteri, who is in her early 30's, possesses a tiny, perfect figure and holds her hair in place with two bobby pins, seems doggedly style-free. She hasn't even fashioned her own lack of self-confidence into a persona, a la Woody Allen or Richard Lewis. ''The big joke is that when you get famous, or even a little known, all your stuff still comes with you,'' she said. ''The only difference is that you can afford the shrimp.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Oteri seems not to believe one bit of her own public relations. Even after five years on ''Saturday Night Live'' and several film roles, including the upcoming ''Scary Movie'' (she spoofs Courtney Cox's ruthless newscaster from ''Scream''), she has the perky demeanor of an actress who just got her first orange juice commercial.</p>
        <p>The cast of ''Friends'' may have bargained for $750,000 an episode, but Ms. Oteri acts almost as though she would pay Lorne Michaels to allow her to appear on ''Saturday Night Live.'' ''It's the most exciting thing you can imagine,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Leaving her apartment in hopes that Stella would emerge from the mattress in time for the appointment at the groomer, she went to lunch at Isabella. (''They actually know me here,'' she said). There, she spoke of growing up average in a middle-class suburb of Philadelphia. ''I wasn't good at anything, really,'' she said, deadpan. ''I'm not kidding. I was extremely mediocre.''</p>
        <p>She graduated from an all-girls Catholic high school and then moved to Los Angeles to go into the music business. She worked in promotion and marketing for a few years  (''I wasn't very good at that, either,'' she said) and spent her spare time performing with the Groundlings, an improvisation troupe. Eventually, she was seen by an agent and sent to New York for a ''Saturday Night Live'' tryout. Nice story, no drama.</p>
        <p>''It was really a miracle that I found something I liked and was good at, because I was a late bloomer, always,'' she said, her words tumbling out. ''When the other girls had given up their Barbies, I was still playing with mine, in secret.''</p>
        <p>Although her sketches have become some of the most popular on the show, she admits she is still a bit intimidated by other cast members, those who have done stand-up.  ''They are the people who are really good on things like talk shows,'' she said, wincing at the memory of an uneasy appearance on ''The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.'' ''He sort of let me be in charge of the interview, and that didn't work for me,'' she said. ''I got really charged up and nervous.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Oteri takes it in stride that she isn't recognized much. ''I do so many characters, plus I'm below eye level,'' she said. But she  is determined to promote ''Scary Movie,'' even if it means braving the talk show circuit. ''I feel myself getting stronger,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Her newfound assertiveness showed itself a few months ago when she was out in Los Angeles, where she keeps an apartment. The producers of ''Saturday Night Live'' called to ask her to meet with Jackie Chan, to cajole him into hosting the season finale, which aired last night. ''I went in there and said, 'Jackie, what can we say to convince you?' '' she recalled, transforming herself into a puffed up mini-mogul. It worked. ''After the meeting, I called them in New York and said, ''We're on,' '' she gloated like the caterpillar in ''Alice in Wonderland,'' when he pulls himself up to his full height.</p>
        <p>Back at her apartment after lunch, there were signs that Stella had ventured out for food but had returned to her hiding place. ''Yup, she's back in there,'' Ms. Oteri said, getting on her knees to poke a flashlight into the labyrinth of bed coils. ''She's so smart. I wish I were that smart. I really do.''</p>
