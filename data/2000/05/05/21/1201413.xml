        <p>Glen Sather said his phones were ringing off the hook at his Edmonton home yesterday, one day after he resigned as president and general manager of the Edmonton Oilers.</p>
        <p>But as of early evening, Sather had yet to hear from Madison Square Garden President Dave Checketts or Checketts's boss, James Dolan.</p>
        <p>''They probably couldn't get through,'' Sather joked.</p>
        <p>Sather did acknowledge on Canadian television that he was intrigued by the Rangers, the team considered the overwhelming favorite to hire him as its next president and general manager.</p>
        <p>''I haven't thought about what I would do if I'm there,'' Sather said in a telephone interview. ''But I've certainly thought about what may happen if I'm offered a job. All that stuff happens.''</p>
        <p>''I can't tell you what would happen,'' Sather said when asked if he would try to bring Kevin Lowe, the current Edmonton coach, and his assistant, Craig MacTavish, with him from Edmonton, and then try to sign Mark Messier to finish out his career in New York. He coached all three.</p>
        <p>Cal Nichols, the chairman of the group that owns the Oilers, has all but confirmed that Lowe is his top choice to replace Sather.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of things to factor in,'' Lowe, speaking from Edmonton, Alberta, said about following Sather. ''If Glen takes another job, where he's going to take it, if he does want me. We have a good relationship. And that could be a possibility. Then there's, do I want to be a general manager? Do I want to move my family?''</p>
        <p>Lowe said he had not come up with the answers to those questions.</p>
        <p>''Glen never came out and said he wants to take me with him,'' Lowe said. ''But we know each other well enough that if he came around and said so, I'd have to give it some serious consideration.''</p>
        <p>Sather said he had not brought Lowe, MacTavish and Messier into the negotiations.</p>
        <p>''I haven't even talked to those guys about any of that stuff,'' he said, referring to Checketts and Dolan.</p>
        <p>''And I don't want to negotiate in the papers with those guys. If something happens, it has to be a decision that they're perfectly comfortable with. But yes, I've thought about a lot of things. You don't get to this stage, without thinking about a lot of things. This was not a spur-of-the-moment decision. It was difficult to make. But I've been thinking about it for a long time.''</p>
        <p>Sather plans to remain in Edmonton until Wednesday or Thursday and then return to his La Quinta, Calif., home.</p>
        <p>''There isn't another meeting planned,'' he said, tacitly acknowledging that there have been meetings with the Rangers in the past.</p>
        <p>But Sather seemed to indicate he would have time in California on Thursday or Friday morning, while his former scouting staff in Edmonton conducts its annual meetings on Sather's property for the last time.</p>
        <p>Sather also related, in general terms, his thoughts about where the Rangers' organization stands. Even though the Rangers had the highest payroll in National Hockey League history last season, at $61.2 million, they missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year. In Edmonton, Sather never had anywhere near that sort of money to work with.</p>
        <p>''I see the Rangers as an entirely different situation,'' Sather said. ''Their assets are a lot different and you have to try to capitalize on what you have to work with.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Sather said he was astonished that Nichols, whose feud with Sather helped lead to Sather's resignation, publicly acknowledged that the contracts of Lowe and MacTavish were tied to Sather's during yesterday's news conference.</p>
        <p>''By letting the world know they're free agents, he created a great situation for them,'' Sather said. ''Now every hockey club in the world that needs a coach can talk to them. It's crazy.''</p>
