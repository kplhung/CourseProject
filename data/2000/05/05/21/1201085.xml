        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Midway through her thoughtful assessment of Tom Cruise's career [''Tom Cruise, Team Player,'' April 30], Molly Haskell writes, ''The sexual insecurity and introspective bent of the protagonist in the Arthur Schnitzler novel Kubrick chose to adapt is something Mr. Cruise simply can't project. The reflective spirit of an intellectual, self-doubting man, anxious about middle age, is not in his repertory.''</p>
        <p>Introspective, reflective, intellectual, self-doubting and worried about middle age may describe the character in Schnitzler's ''Traumnovelle'' very well, but they do not describe the young, decidedly unintrospective character, with no apparent intellectual interests, that Kubrick created in collaboration with the screenwriter Frederic Raphael for ''Eyes Wide Shut.'' Kubrick's movie portrays two complacent, upper-middle-class, present-day New Yorkers who have the surface of their unexamined lives broken and find the experience disturbing. They are people who, as the title puts it, live with their ''eyes wide shut,'' and this is exactly what Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman convey in their performances.</p>
        <p>Whatever one thinks of it, including the inspired banality of its sex scenes, Kubrick's last movie can't sensibly be measured in Schnitzler's terms. Nor can Tom Cruise's performance.</p>
