        <p>The Investment Company Institute, the main trade group for the mutual fund industry, reacted coolly last week to a call for it to back more frequent mandatory disclosure of fund portfolios.</p>
        <p>Investment companies are now required to disclose their holdings twice a year under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations -- a rule that has not changed in more than 60 years. A few funds voluntarily report more often.</p>
        <p>A letter to Matthew Fink, president of the institute, calling for a committee to study the issue and advocate new rules was signed by John Rekenthaler, research director of Morningstar Inc., the fund data company; Thomas O'Hara, chairman of the National Association of Investment Clubs; and Donald Luskin and H. Davis Nadig, co-founders of MetaMarkets.com, whose OpenFund reports its portfolio and trades live over the Internet.</p>
        <p>''The issue has generated discussion for many years, and the institute has considered it with many members on several occasions,'' Mr. Fink told Dow Jones News. ''The current requirement to disclose portfolio information semiannually remains appropriate.'' Even so, Mr. Fink said he would put the issue on the agenda for a meeting of the institute's rules committee on June 20.</p>
