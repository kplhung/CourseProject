        <p>AN important line of defense for what may be a hot and dry summer is to practice the art of mulching.</p>
        <p>A mulch is simply a kind of ground covering to stop the weeds, keep the surface and the roots cool and, best of all, to conserve moisture in the soil. There are many kinds of mulch available, and, for budget reasons, the best mulch is the one that is most easily available. For many gardeners this is a tidy cover of chopped up leaves left over from last fall. Many gardeners even plan for this by storing piles of chopped up leaves in the fall for use in the spring. This leafy mulch always looks great and the best part is that it biodegrades quickly.</p>

        <p>AN important line of defense for what may be a hot and dry summer is to practice the art of mulching.</p>
        <p>A mulch is simply a kind of ground covering to stop the weeds, keep the surface and the roots cool and, best of all, to conserve moisture in the soil. There are many kinds of mulch available, and, for budget reasons, the best mulch is the one that is most easily available. For many gardeners this is a tidy cover of chopped up leaves left over from last fall. Many gardeners even plan for this by storing piles of chopped up leaves in the fall for use in the spring. This leafy mulch always looks great and the best part is that it biodegrades quickly.</p>
        <p>Another mulch that is growing in popularity is composed of wood chips and bark. This material, available from timber-cutting operations, is bagged in many sizes, and most well-stocked garden centers have ample supplies. It is sold in many sizes from  tiny bits to the large, inch-size or bigger nuggets. The wood chip or bark mulch looks great as a tidy finish for shrub borders. It is also an excellent ground cover for service areas with garbage cans, places  where weed growth can sometimes be a nuisance.</p>
        <p>One negative about the use of wood chip and bark mulches is the tendency of such material to usurp nitrogen from the soil as the lignin in the wood decomposes. Plants growing where there is heavy use of wood-chip mulch may develop yellowing foliage from lack of nitrogen. If the problem develops, it can easily be corrected by applications of fertilizer. (The water-soluble formulations work best in these cases.)</p>
        <p>The traditional mulch material for roses has been buckwheat or cocoa hulls, the latter being the most expensive. Some gardeners object to the scent when cocoa hulls are used,  but since these mulches are light in weight, they must be applied thickly before they are blown away. The hull mulches do not decompose as readily, so they seem to last for many seasons. Such mulches do keep the soil cool, minimize weed growth and, best of all, offset the fine display of roses in bloom.</p>
        <p>Plastic mulches can be something of a nuisance. They always seem to get out of shape, even though they may be covered with soil. Windstorms and heavy rains displace them and they seem to poke up where they are not wanted. Vegetable gardeners have the most success with plastic mulch since the strips of black material can be spread out between the rows, and cut-outs made in them for the placement of the vegetable plants.</p>
        <p>Alas, peat moss is becoming popular with many commercial landscapers. But this mulch eventually proves to be an expensive waste of effort. Peat moss is one of the highest-priced materials to use and, worst of all, rather than retaining  soil moisture, peat absorbs moisture and the ground underneath becomes dry. If peat moss is used, it should be mixed with the soil.</p>
        <p>This spring visitors will find a new sort of mulch called Emerge at garden centers. It is made from recycled newsprint, polymers and a start-up fertilizer. All these raw materials are made into a slurry, then extruded into small pellets. Green pellets are to be used on the lawn, and brown ones with transplants. When exposed to rain, the pellets expand to about four times their original size.</p>
        <p>One nice feature about this mulch is that it is light in weight and can be quickly applied when seedlings are being transplanted. Also, because it is made of recycled paper, the product can be handled easily, without gloves.</p>
        <p>Emerge was developed by the College of Agricultural Sciences at Pennsylvania State University where the agronomists studying the development found that this sort of mulch, with its added starter fertilizer, hastened grass seed germination and also caused the transplanted seedlings to get a faster start. The mulch expands as it absorbs moisture and decomposes in a few months time.</p>
        <p>An often overlooked advantage of any mulch is its ability to keep plant foliage clean, which is especially meaningful when flowers are cut for bouquets. Often short-stemmed flowers, if growing where the soil is unmulched, become splashed with soil either from watering or rainfall and the leaves and often the flowers themselves have to be rinsed off before they can be used in a vase.</p>
        <p>Finally, the control of excessive weed growth is a definite asset of good mulching. Too often pesky grasses or weeds have a sneaky way of taking hold and if the ground is well protected with a two- to three-inch layer of mulch material, weed growth is discouraged. The gardener is the winner.</p>
