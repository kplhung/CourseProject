        <p>CHAOS and disorder ruled Poland in the mid-1980's,'' said the Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski, best known here for ''The Double Life of Veronique'' (1992) and the ''Three Colors'' trilogy, ''Blue'' (1993), ''White'' and ''Red'' (both 1994).

I sensed mutual indifference behind polite smiles and had the overwhelming impression that, more and more frequently, I was watching people who didn't really know why they were living.''</p>

        <p>CHAOS and disorder ruled Poland in the mid-1980's,'' said the Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski, best known here for ''The Double Life of Veronique'' (1992) and the ''Three Colors'' trilogy, ''Blue'' (1993), ''White'' and ''Red'' (both 1994). ''Tension, a feeling of hopelessness and a fear of yet worse to come were obvious.''</p>
        <p>''I'd already started to travel abroad a bit by this time and observed a general uncertainty in the world at large,'' he told Danusia Stok in a series of interviews published in the 1993 book ''Kieslowski on Kieslowski.''  ''I'm not even thinking about politics here but about ordinary, everyday life. I sensed mutual indifference behind polite smiles and had the overwhelming impression that, more and more frequently, I was watching people who didn't really know why they were living.''</p>
        <p>One cold and rainy day during that turbulent decade, Kieslowski recalled, he ''happened to bump into'' his co-scriptwriter, Krzysztof Piesiewicz, a lawyer whom he had met when Mr. Piesiewicz was defending people accused of crimes under Poland's martial law. Mr. Piesiewicz suggested making a film based on the 10 commandments; the result was a collaboration on ''The Decalogue,'' an acclaimed 10-part series of one-hour films first shown on Polish television in 1988 and recently released on video by Facets Multimedia. (Information: 800-331-6197).</p>
        <p>Though most of the films are set in a bleak, Soviet-style housing complex in Warsaw, Kieslowski was adamant that they not be limited to Poland's political and social circumstances. So he spared his viewers ''anything as horrible as politics,'' ''queues in front of shops'' and ration cards, and the films' appeal is universal. Themes of chance, fate, honesty, the possibility of a divine presence, and social and personal responsibility are all broached through 10 stories of individuals who, Kieslowski said, ''suddenly realize that they're going round and round in circles, that they're not achieving what they want.''</p>
        <p>In the first film, the son of a university professor drowns in a nearby pond after he and his father have carefully calculated that the ice would be thick enough to hold him; in the second, a woman pregnant by a man not her husband is basing her decision to abort or keep the unborn child on whether her hospitalized husband will die. The connections between these films and the corresponding commandments (''I am the Lord thy God; Thou shalt have no other gods before me'' and ''Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain,'' respectively) are ambiguous and oblique, an ambiguity elegantly suggested in other Kieslowski films when he shoots scenes through windows or off reflective surfaces. In the sixth episode, a young man slashes his wrists (but survives) after spying on and falling in love with a free-spirited woman. The camera's viewpoint shifts as she develops an affection for him. ''We watch from the point of view of the person who is loving and not the person who is loved,'' said Kieslowski. ''And this love is always tied up with some sort of suffering, some sort of impossibility.''</p>
        <p>After such demanding stories, told sparely and beautifully in terms that run true to the characters, a black comedy for the 10th comes as a surprise. Two charmingly inept brothers discover that their deceased father had collected an extremely valuable stamp collection, and embark on a quirky, convoluted path that includes bartering a kidney for some stamps to secure their fortune.</p>
        <p>''Ending with a comedy tells you something about Kieslowski's attitude to 'The Decalogue' as a whole,'' said Izabela Kalinowska, who has taught film studies at Yale University and the State University of New York at Stony Brook. ''He's not going back to the Ten Commandments to reaffirm them, but rather to engage in an open-ended dialogue with the viewer. What is it that governs our lives? Is it chance? Or is there some controlling presence behind the visible reality?''</p>
        <p>Kieslowski, who was described in The Washington Post as having a ''tall, slim, physical grace,'' died in March 1996, of a heart attack at the age of 54. Two years earlier, he had announced his retirement from directing, citing at various times a desire to have more time to read, to mow the lawn and, mocking both his interviewer and his own fate, to smoke. But not long before he died, he had reportedly confided to friends that he was planning to collaborate with Mr. Piesiewicz on a trilogy. The subject? Heaven, hell and purgatory.</p>
