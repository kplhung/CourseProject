        <p>NEW YORK has long been a subject of study by scholars and fare for academic as well as popular publishers. Here are excerpts from three recent books from university presses that explore various aspects of the city: a collection of essays from that quintessential New York observer, William H. Whyte; a history of how the city created its amazing water system; and a sociologist's view of how New York, along with Chicago and Los Angeles, take their place in the global economy.</p>
        <p>THE ESSENTIAL  WILLIAM H. WHYTE  Edited by Albert LaFarge  Fordham University Press  (Hardcover, $39.95, Paper $19.95)</p>
        <p>Street vendors sell everything. There are perennial staples: junk jewelry, watches, umbrellas, plastic raincoats, toys. But the vendors are always trying out new items and occasionally most of them will be riding one fad, or whatever the jobbers are loaded up with. Several years ago it was leather belts. So many vendors took to selling them that it looked like the point of saturation had surely been reached. But supply created demand, and the sight of all those leather belts on the sidewalks drove people to buy more leather belts. They are still buying them.</p>
        <p>The vendors have been growing in number. They have been broadening the range of the merchandise sold. To the aggravation of merchants, they have also been staking out more of the sidewalk space, that in front of stores especially. They have been doing more selling in winter and more night selling. Some illumine their racks and table with battery-powered fluorescent lamps.</p>
        <p>Whatever the merchandise, the pitch is much the same. It's cheaper on the street. Ten dollars inside. One dollar here. Why pay more? The pitch is often made in a furtive manner, as if the deal were shady. Many vendors look shady. Many try to. It is to their advantage. There is a widespread assumption among knowing New Yorkers that much of the merchandise is stolen. Vendors do nothing to discourage this idea. As in a con game, the latent dishonesty of the customer is all for the good. He wants the goods to be stolen. That explains why he is going to snare a bargain. In actual fact, very little of the goods sold by vendors is stolen. They pick up their stuff from the jobbers in the Broadway-30th Street area who specialize in novelty merchandise. But if you ask the vendors where the goods came from, they may look at you slyly and wink.</p>
        <p>WATER FOR GOTHAM  By Gerard T. Koeppel  Princeton University Press  (Hardcover, $29.95)</p>
        <p>New York did not fare well during the Revolution. A fire two years into the British occupation destroyed much of what the 1776 fire missed, leaving the city ''almost half Burned to Ashes.'' Shelter, food, and fuel were in short supply. In the winter of 1780, river traffic was blocked by ice and people froze to death from lack of firewood; during a 1781 reconnoiter, George Washington reported the island ''totally stripped of trees.''</p>
        <p>Drought and deforestation played havoc with the groundwater. There was no rain for two months in the spring of 1780; in the summer of 1782, the town wells were dry and Hessian soldiers dug holes forty feet deep without striking water, arousing fears of death from thirst.</p>
        <p>Sanitation, moderately efficient since the 1740's, had broken down by the first summer of occupation. A newly arrived Englishman believed a ''treatise upon stinks'' could be written about New York; a 1780 proclamation ordered all garbage dumped into Beekman's Swamp, an unhappy prospect.</p>
        <p>Maintenance of the public wells and pumps fell to an ad hoc vestry. As civic order was breaking down just before the Revolution, control of well and pump overseer appointments had passed from the Common Council to the city's secular, elected vestrymen, whose primary responsibility since the 1740's had been ministering to the poor, collecting and distributing the poor tax, and overseeing the almshouse. This ward-based vestry disappeared under occupation, replaced by a group of loyalist citizens appointed by the British commandant of New York. The occupation vestry eventually took over the duties of the elected vestry, as well as most of the functions of the disbanded Common Council. Without tax collection, the appointed vestry did what it could about the poor, the pumps, sanitation, and other government duties by collecting donations, exorbitant rent on abandoned houses, criminal fines, and tavern license fees. This was no easy task; by the end of the war in 1783, the occupied town was bloated with some 30,000 people, most of them impoverished loyalist refugees.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK, CHICAGO, LOS ANGELES: America's Global Cities  By Janet L. Abu-Lughod  University of Minnesota Press  (Hardcover, $39.95)</p>
        <p>By the early twentieth century, it had become absolutely impossible to extend New York City's boundaries. This meant that its legal jurisdiction fell increasingly short of its metropolitan extent. Coordinated developments became more difficult, and different mechanisms, outside existing political structures, had to be invented. It was then that special districts and ''authorities'' were institutionalized to supplement and even substitute for municipal rule, and informal ''regional'' plans were advocated to guide a metropolitan expansion that could no longer be encompassed by city government. Because of New York's unique constellation of waterways, ports, and ''inconvenient'' state boundaries, this required inventiveness of the highest order.</p>
        <p>Paralleling the process of horizontal expansion was a shirt upward in the vertical scale, and here, too, the ''role of the state'' was central. True skyscrapers came to dominate the skyline of lower Manhattan, as steel-frame structures and elevators became the taken-for-granted cliches of new construction. Zoning, first experimented with in New York City in 1916, was adopted as a planning mechanism for controlling densities and land uses in the city. It also had a forming effect on the skyline of Manhattan.</p>
