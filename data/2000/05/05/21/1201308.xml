        <p>The photograph of Thomas E. Blanton Jr. in last Thursday's Times came as a shock. The last time I saw Tommy Blanton, one of two former Ku Klux Klansmen jailed in Alabama last week, he had the chunky look and some of the swagger of a honky-tonk tough. But his appearance, at 61, is indisputably that of a puffy old man. It was a big change from 18 years ago when I interviewed Mr. Blanton about his alleged role in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, where four children died on Sept. 15, 1963.</p>
        <p>We met in a coffee shop near the University of Alabama in Birmingham. As I expected, he denied any knowledge of the bombing. He even feigned a lack of interest in the entire subject. But he perked right up when I mentioned that I had been in touch with Robert E. Chambliss, who was in prison near Montgomery. Then Mr. Blanton became the questioner. Had Mr. Chambliss mentioned him? he asked.</p>

        <p>The photograph of Thomas E. Blanton Jr. in last Thursday's Times came as a shock. The last time I saw Tommy Blanton, one of two former Ku Klux Klansmen jailed in Alabama last week, he had the chunky look and some of the swagger of a honky-tonk tough. But his appearance, at 61, is indisputably that of a puffy old man. It was a big change from 18 years ago when I interviewed Mr. Blanton about his alleged role in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, where four children died on Sept. 15, 1963.</p>
        <p>We met in a coffee shop near the University of Alabama in Birmingham. As I expected, he denied any knowledge of the bombing. He even feigned a lack of interest in the entire subject. But he perked right up when I mentioned that I had been in touch with Robert E. Chambliss, who was in prison near Montgomery. Then Mr. Blanton became the questioner. Had Mr. Chambliss mentioned him? he asked.</p>
        <p>I, of course, understood the source of Mr. Blanton's sudden curiosity. As long as ''Dynamite Bob'' Chambliss remained silent, his old friends were safe from implication in the crime for which Mr. Chambliss was convicted of murder in 1977. It is the fate of men who belonged to Eastview Klavern 13, the most violent urban Klan unit in American history, to fear voices from the past. Mr. Chambliss is dead now, but someone from the past has been talking. That is why Mr. Blanton and Bobby Frank Cherry, now 69, are in solitary confinement in the Jefferson County jail, both charged with multiple counts of murder.</p>
        <p>A jury will decide the question of their guilt, but we know the probable outlines of the case against them from testimony in the Chambliss trial and from Federal Bureau of Investigation files. Citing informants who claimed eyewitness knowledge of the area around the church, F.B.I. documents asserted that ''the bombing was the handiwork of Robert E. Chambliss, Bobby Frank Cherry, Herman Frank Cash, Thomas E. Blanton, Jr. and probably Troy Ingram.'' Mr. Cash and Mr. Ingram, who was suspected of building the delayed-trigger bomb, are dead. Mr. Chambliss died in prison in 1985 after turning aside opportunities to get a reduced sentence in exchange for testimony against other suspects.</p>
        <p>When I talked to Mr. Blanton almost two decades ago, he was cagey enough to worry that Dynamite Bob might be tempted by offers of clemency. What he didn't know was that the hate-filled old man was delusional. Mr. Chambliss thought, for example, that Gov. George Wallace would eventually pardon him. He also believed that Tommy Blanton was going to use a night-school law degree to mount legal appeals that would lead to Mr. Chambliss's freedom.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blanton did have some legal interests. At one point, he hired a lawyer for the impossible task of getting his name expunged from F.B.I. files. That would have been a mountainous task, for Eastview Klavern 13 was riddled with paid and volunteer informants who had a lot to tell about Mr. Blanton, Mr. Cherry, Mr. Chambliss and the ''action squad'' that carried out acts of racial violence. Many of those informants are dead now, meaning that Doug Jones, the energetic United States attorney who secured the new indictments, will have to build a mosaic of evidence from relatives and associates of the two men or from eyewitnesses who have not testified before. We already know from news accounts that Mr. Cherry's former wife is likely to come forward and report on what she says Mr. Cherry said about the bomb: ''I lit it.'' As a longtime student of the case, I will be interested to see who else appears at the new trials. In the past, investigators have gotten inconclusive statements from Mr. Blanton's former wife as to his whereabouts on Sept. 15. Changes in her testimony could be extremely damaging to him, especially since other witnesses have placed Mr. Blanton's car outside the church about eight hours before it blew up during Sunday services.</p>
        <p>The question of who testifies in these old cases is a fascinating one. Bill Baxley, the Alabama attorney general who prosecuted Mr. Chambliss, says that information from abused wives and girlfriends is a ''common thread'' in Klan cases. A black witness who had been afraid to testify in the 1960's was also critical in the Chambliss trial. But predictions that aging Klansmen would eventually want to purge their consciences have proved wrong.</p>
        <p>''I thought we would have some deathbed confessions -- people not wanting to go to their maker with a guilty conscience,'' said Mr. Baxley, whose expertise in coaxing fearful witnesses was crucial in the 1977 trial. ''We haven't seen that. It just shows how far gone those hard-core haters were. They don't have any remorse. Hatred of people on account of their color just overcomes other factors in their brains.''</p>
        <p>In the heyday of Klavern 13, back in 1963, Mr. Blanton and Mr. Cherry were proud to be known as the hardest of a hard-core lot in the heart of Dixie. By the end of 2000, we will hear the testimony of other citizens willing to prove that old times there are not forgotten.</p>
