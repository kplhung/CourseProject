        <p>EVEN if, as the Beach Boys sang, everybody did have an ocean across the U.S.A., they still might not be surfin' like Californ-eye-ay. (As any novice can attest, it's at least as hard as it looks.)</p>
        <p>But this summer's fashionable beachcombers will be wearing their baggies, and their Archie sandals, too, just like the guys on the water. The surf fashion trend that has been growing in recent years has become, well, a huge wave that is already breaking over department stores, SoHo shops and other outlets.</p>

        <p>EVEN if, as the Beach Boys sang, everybody did have an ocean across the U.S.A., they still might not be surfin' like Californ-eye-ay. (As any novice can attest, it's at least as hard as it looks.)</p>
        <p>But this summer's fashionable beachcombers will be wearing their baggies, and their Archie sandals, too, just like the guys on the water. The surf fashion trend that has been growing in recent years has become, well, a huge wave that is already breaking over department stores, SoHo shops and other outlets.</p>
        <p>To visit any big men's wear department -- for example, to step off the elevator on the second floor at Macy's Herald Square -- is to wade into fashion's North Shore of Oahu. Tommy Hilfiger has traded in his house on Cape Cod for a little grass shack, turning his display area into a nylon rain forest. Hilfiger was ridiculed early on by surfers for sewing mesh briefs into its board shorts, but the label has learned its lesson, and has come back strong with some classic designs.</p>
        <p>At Ralph Lauren, there are wildly colored board shorts that may never get wet unless it rains, and tank tops. T-shirts in every conceivable surf-related pattern hang on racks shaped like surfboards.</p>
        <p>''Surf and tropical is, by far, the No. 1 summer trend,'' said Joseph Dinofrio, Macy's vice president for fashion. ''We started seeing little tastes of it last year, and now there's a full head on it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dinofrio said the popularity of flowery surf patterns was probably a reaction to the racing stripes that predominated in the late 1990's. And the rise of board shorts -- cut baggy and long for freedom of movement and protection against chafing -- may be an outgrowth of pop fashion's long-and-baggy trend, manifested in cargo and basketball shorts.</p>
        <p>Down in SoHo, Quicksilver, an authentic surf brand based in California, has opened a shop on Spring Street. The metal handles on the shop doors are shaped like a pair of miniature surfboards, so trendy rippers (expert surfers) have to grab a rail (the edge of a surfboard) just to check out the Hawaiian shirts and hooded sweatshirts.</p>
        <p>For surfer girls, there are jeans, camisoles and floral print bikinis by the company's Roxy label.</p>
        <p>Quicksilver's labels say its products are used by ''real surfers.'' That might be enough to make real real surfers cry. It would be easy, even understandable, for them to sneer at the towel potatoes on the beach tricked out in their Rip Curl shorts, sideburns and Dragon shades.</p>
        <p>But it may be that real surfers couldn't care less what other people on the beach are wearing. ''We all love the beach, and we all love the ocean for different reasons,'' said George Browne, 50, of Bayville, N.J., who has been surfing since 1968. ''I happen to love the ocean to catch waves, and the people who want to look like us, that's fine.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Browne, who surfs mainly in Lavallette, N.J., easily qualifies as a soul surfer, a veteran with a boundless love of surfing, as well as respect for the beauty and power of the ocean itself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Browne is a long boarder -- that is, he rides a board measuring nine feet or more, which offers a more mellow ride. A long board is also more effective in small surf than so-called short boards of seven feet or less, which are generally nimbler and faster, and are generally preferred by brash young types. In between, there are so-called fun boards.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown's 19-year-old son, Phil, is a semiprofessional surfer who flies to places like Hawaii, Tahiti and, this month, Barbados, in pursuit of the perfect wave. He strives not so much to place high in competitions but to be photographed in ideal settings by photographers eager to publish. This delights him and his sponsor, Billabong, because it helps the company sell board shorts and T-shirts.</p>
        <p>Surfing has been a part of American pop culture since the 1960's, when California bands recorded hits harmonizing over borrowed Chuck Berry guitar riffs, and Bruce Brown released his quintessential surf film, ''The Endless Summer.''</p>
        <p>These days the pursuit of a good wave takes place on the Jersey Shore from Sandy Hook to Cape May, and on Long Island to the tip of Montauk.</p>
        <p>New York City itself has surfing on Rockaway Beach. ''You can take a subway to surf,'' said Eron Bloomgarden, 25, of Manhattan, an Internet marketing specialist for I.B.M. who surfs the Net at work, then heads for the real thing on Long Island at Long Beach, Lido Beach and Gilgo.</p>
        <p>The Surfrider Foundation, an environmental group made up mostly of surfers, has been among the leading opponents of ocean dumping off Sandy Hook. It has also successfully fought surfing bans at municipal beaches on the Jersey Shore in Deal, Ortley Beach, Point Pleasant and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''People do get connected to the environment via articles in surfer magazines,'' said Kristin Milligan, 29, of South Belmar, N.J., a marine biologist with the Clean Ocean Action environmental group who builds her own surfboards.</p>
        <p>Then again, she added, ''a lot of surfers are some of the least environmentally aware people I've ever seen. I mean, they trash the beach. Like, their surf wax? It comes in plastic? And they leave that plastic on the beach.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Milligan is both a serious environmentalist who sits on the Surfrider Foundation's Environmental Issues Team and part surfer girl, working the Jersey Shore with a group of about 30 women known as the Ocean Divas.</p>
        <p>''A lot of real surfers I know take real pleasure in wearing surf clothes,'' Ms. Milligan said. ''When we get together, the girls like to talk about that kind of stuff.''</p>
        <p>No one is really sure how many people are out there catching waves, but a possible indicator of the sport's increasing popularity is the growth of the Surfrider Foundation, which was founded in 1984 in Malibu. The number of chapters has grown from 10 in 1992 to 48 currently, including chapters in New Jersey, in Montauk and, as of December, in New York City. The foundation's 25,000 dues-paying members include 1,554 in New Jersey and 1,287 in New York State.</p>
        <p>The organization's president, Christopher J. Evans, is a native of Huntington on Long Island, and its chapter operations director, Edward Mazzarella, was born in West Islip there. ''As far as our growth and awareness, I think it's related to growth in the surf industry,'' Mr. Mazzarella said. ''And the whole image.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomgarten, the New York City surfer, took up the sport five years ago after being transfixed by surfers on the North Shore. He is now the chief organizer of Surfriders' New York City chapter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomgarten admitted that he himself was first attracted by the surfer image as much as by the sport. While he eventually ended up putting his board shorts to real use, he has no problem with the likelihood that most people never will, saying, ''You don't need to do the sport to achieve the look.''</p>
