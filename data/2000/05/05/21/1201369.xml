        <p>Cherie Blair, the wife of Prime Minister Tony Blair, gave birth to a boy early today, and hours later mother, father and son left the London hospital for a quiet weekend in the privacy of 10 Downing Street.</p>
        <p>''Cherie and the baby are absolutely fine,'' Mr. Blair told reporters outside the official residence at midday. ''He's a gorgeous little boy, and they are just resting now.''</p>
        <p>The fourth child for the Blairs and the first baby born to a serving prime minister in 152 years, Leo Blair arrived at 12:25 a.m. weighing 6 pounds 12 ounces. He was named for Mr. Blair's 76-year-old father, whom the prime minister called at his home in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, with the news shortly after returning to Downing Street at 3 a.m.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Blair, 45, had a natural childbirth, and Mr. Blair said he had been present in the delivery room. ''It was quite a long labor,'' he said. ''It went on for quite a few hours, but it is quite a struggle in the end for Cherie, and I think she is very relieved it's all over.''</p>
        <p>Looking tired but relaxed in an open neck blue button-down shirt and carrying a mug of coffee, Mr. Blair, 47, said: ''I feel like any father who sees their baby born. It's very moving really, and if any of you have been through it, you'll know it.'' The baby, he said, had been ''really good through the night.''</p>
        <p>''The thing is,'' he continued, ''you forget how tiny they are, and also changing nappies in the middle of the night.''</p>
        <p>He quickly added, ''It's quite an experience, but it's worse for Cherie, I think.''</p>
        <p>There has been tremendous news interest in the arrival of a new Blair, but the family delivered today on its wish to keep the event as private as possible. Except for the curbside news conference and the flowers that kept arriving through the morning at the famous black front door with the white 10 on it, the day was much like any other Saturday at the Downing Street residence where the Blairs have made a point of trying to produce as normal an upbringing as possible for their family. The couple's other children, Euan, 16, Nicky, 14, and Kathryn, 12, have been kept out of the public spotlight, and judging by the first day of his life, little Leo will also.</p>
        <p>A single bobby kept guard outside, and a construction team worked noisily with spades, hammers and a pneumatic drill on a leaking fire hydrant on the pavement opposite the brown brick building housing the family apartment. Asked if he was worried he might be waking the Blairs' newborn son, the drill operator, Chris Southam, 28, said, ''I don't feel guilty because I have to work seven days a week.''</p>
        <p>Among the first bouquets to arrive were ones from the queen and Prince Philip and from the Conservative Party leader, William Hague, 39, who was obliged by repeated questions from the press to say this week that yes, he and his wife Ffion did intend to start a family as soon as they could.</p>
        <p>With so few images to play, television news spent the day interviewing astrologers, baby magazine editors, parental rights advocates and bookmakers, who had made Leo a 2-to-1 shot as the best bet for the name.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Blair had gone to the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital at noon Friday, entering by an underground entrance to avoid reporters and cameramen who were stacked three deep outside. The prime minister followed in the evening, with an aide carrying an overnight bag that was all the evidence the Saturday morning newspapers needed to make the imminence of the new arrival their page one headlines.</p>
        <p>An article in today's Independent captured the mood. ''The rumors started at lunchtime,'' it read. ''A 45-year-old woman had gone into labor, and Fleet Street prepared to give birth.''</p>
        <p>The original announcement that Mrs. Blair was pregnant came from Downing Street on Nov. 18 after word leaked to one of London's tabloid newspapers. Mrs. Blair had surprised her husband with the news in late September as he worked in his office preparing the speech he was to deliver days later to the annual Labor Party conference.</p>
        <p>''It was not a moment to forget, but I do a little because I was so shocked,'' Mr. Blair said in an interview published last Sunday in The New York Times Magazine. ''Delighted, of course, but really shocked.  I think I said, 'You must be joking,' and she said, 'No, I'm not.' I asked, you know, all the usual questions. And I think I did get around to saying, 'That's wonderful, darling.' But that was after a few minutes.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Blair, a prominent employment rights lawyer, continued working almost up to the birth, her last court appearance this week appropriately dealing with the issue of parents juggling career and family. On Tuesday she argued a case for the Trade Unions Congress that challenged the way Mr. Blair's government has introduced parental leave benefits.</p>
        <p>The new law, modeled on a European Union directive, gives parents the right to take 13 weeks off during the first five years of their child's life, but the Blair government has restricted the benefit to parents of children born after Dec. 15, 1999. Mrs. Blair, who practices under her unmarried name, Cherie Booth, told the justices that the limit unlawfully excluded 2.7 million people who were already parents of children under 5.</p>
        <p>The whole matter of parental leave became an issue for the Blairs when she noted in a speech to a legal group in London the experience of the Finnish prime minister, Paavo Lipponen, 59, who took a week away from the office to spend with his newborn daughter in March. Mrs. Blair pointedly encouraged the ''widespread adoption'' of Mr. Lipponen's ''fine example.''</p>
        <p>Attention turned to Mr. Blair, who let his decision on how he would react be known in the Times Magazine interview. ''I know what people want me to say,'' he said, ''but the truth is if I went away and stopped taking calls or having any conversations, it just wouldn't be real.</p>
        <p>''I'll take more time off. I'll try to cut down on official things. You've got to have some common sense about it -- you want to spend more time with your baby, but you don't give up the job.''</p>
