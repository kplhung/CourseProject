        <p>Jabbing, apologizing and then jabbing again, it takes Harriet Ayikoru nearly 20 minutes to find a usable vein beneath the sleeves of the sad old Tweety Bird T-shirt that Sentina Drajiru wears, and when the melarsoprol goes in, Ms. Drajiru winces.</p>
        <p>Again and again she lightly touches her arm to show exactly where she feels the sharp tip of the pain as the medicine simmers up it.</p>
        <p>It is like eating chili peppers, she says, only it is inside her.</p>
        <p>''Once you use this drug, the vein is spoiled,'' says Miss Ayikoru, a nurse in the thatched clinic here. ''As it is corrosive, it erodes the inside layer. So the relapses like her are the hardest cases -- the scar tissue is there even six months later.''</p>
        <p>Melarsoprol, invented almost 70 years ago, is melarsen oxide dissolved in propylene glycol -- literally, arsenic in antifreeze. It kills 5 percent of those treated with it. But it is the only medicine available to treat advanced sleeping sickness, one of the historic scourges of Africa, which was nearly wiped out 50 years ago, but has made a comeback.</p>
        <p>The only alternative ran out in July. The manufacturer, which abandoned it as unprofitable when it turned out to be useless against its intended target, cancer, has made one last batch, enough for 1,000 patients. But 300,000 people are infected each year.</p>
        <p>Sleeping sickness is perhaps the most vivid example of the disconnection between the world's pharmaceutical giants and the fatal or debilitating diseases of the third world's poor.</p>
        <p>These ailments go untreated or badly treated not just because the poor cannot afford the drugs they need, though that is a serious problem, but because the drugs themselves do not exist. The pharmaceutical industry has little incentive to invent them. Companies decline to invest the huge sums needed to chase a cure they know their potential customers cannot afford.</p>
        <p>According to IMS Health of Westport, Conn., a marketing research firm that studies the industry, Africa accounts for 1 percent of world drug sales, while North America, Japan and Western Europe account for 80 percent. It is for them the companies invent a stream of high-priced, highly profitable drugs.</p>
        <p>''The poor have no consumer power, so the market has failed them,'' said Dr. James Orbinski, international president of Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres, the medical agency whose work in war zones and in the third world won it the Nobel Peace Prize last year. ''I'm tired of the logic that says, 'He who can't pay, dies.' ''</p>
        <p>Pharmaceutical executives reluctantly concur with his assessment. Told that the industry's critics say it would rather find a cure for a bald American than a dying African, Francois Gros, a spokesman for Aventis, the French-German pharmaceutical company that makes three of the four sleeping sickness drugs, ruefully acknowledged: ''That's not completely wrong. We know what's happening in the third world, but we don't act.''</p>
        <p>He continued: ''We can't deny that we try to focus on top markets -- cardiovascular, metabolism, anti-infection, etc. But we're an industry in a competitive environment -- we have a commitment to deliver performance for shareholders.''</p>
        <p>Predictable Behavior</p>
        <p>Health experts also recognize this reality. ''A blockbuster drug makes them $1 billion to $1.5 billion a year,'' said a senior World Health Organization official. ''If you're running the R &amp; D department of one of these companies, you're under a lot of pressure, and they're going to invest in things they see a market for. Their behavior is perfectly predictable.''</p>
        <p>As a result, many health policy makers now argue that the world's governments must somehow force the world's pharmaceutical manufacturers to turn their attention to diseases like sleeping sickness, malaria, tuberculosis, leishmaniasis and the various burrowing worms that kill or cripple millions each year in Africa, Asia and South America. The last truly new drug for tuberculosis, for example, which kills two million people a year, was invented over 30 years ago.</p>
        <p>To do so, they say, rich nations must either pay the manufacturers directly, offer them tax breaks, dangle before them the carrot of longer patents on their most lucrative drugs, or, in acute crises, simply allow poor countries to declare health emergencies and seize the patents to make their own generic versions or buy them from India, Brazil or other countries that ignore Western patent law.</p>
        <p>[Earlier this month, five major pharmaceutical companies announced that they were entering negotiations with the W.H.O. to voluntarily lower their prices on their AIDS drugs to Africa by as much as 80 percent. But last week, at a global convention of health ministers at the W.H.O.'s headquarters in Geneva, the ministers of many poor nations said that was not enough. They asked the W.H.O. to create a database of all prices for AIDS drugs, including the cheapest generics from countries that do not honor American or European patents, and to help them change their patent laws so they could buy them.]</p>
        <p>The pharmaceutical industry invests $27 billion a year in research, but most of that is a hunt for drugs to lengthen or brighten the lives of consumers who are already relatively healthy. Among the biggest sellers are drugs to grow hair, relieve impotence or fight cholesterol, ulcers, depressions, anxiety, allergies, arthritis and high blood pressure.</p>
        <p>''Pharmaceutical companies will always aim for maximum profits by marketing a new obesity drug rather than pioneering a novel malaria treatment,'' said Dr. Bernard Pecoul, who heads the Doctors Without Borders campaign to get affordable drugs into the more than 80 countries where the group works. ''When new vaccines or medicines are developed, most of the world's population is left out of the picture.''</p>
        <p>Market research is now just as important as science in guiding the decisions of drug companies. While executives decline to say publicly how much potential profit a drug must have to interest them, many spoke privately to W.H.O. researchers doing a 1998 study of why new tuberculosis drugs were not being made.</p>
        <p>''The major companies are aiming for $1 billion at peak sales,'' the study concluded. ''Targets vary for companies, but many want to generate a minimum of $200 million per annum.''</p>
        <p>According to a study led by Dr. Pecoul, of the 1,233 new medicines patented between 1975 and 1997, only 13 -- 1 percent -- were for tropical diseases.</p>
        <p>Even of those, only 4 came from efforts by pharmaceutical companies to cure humans. The 9 others came from work done by the United States Army for the Vietnam War or from research for livestock or the pet market, which industry representatives say could be a gold mine.  Already, Novartis makes a drug to treat separation anxiety in dogs, and Pfizer has one for dog Alzheimer's.</p>
        <p>No major company is doing new research on sleeping sickness.</p>
        <p>The town of Omugo in northwest Uganda, a strip of crumbly red clay stores and thatched mud houses that resemble chocolates in straw hats, is at the center of the sleeping sickness epidemic that goes deep into both war-torn Congo and war-torn Sudan.</p>
        <p>The colonial-era programs that sprayed insecticide, cleared riverine brush, treated patients and moved whole villages away from fly-infested areas are no more than an ancestral memory now. Fifty years of shifting civil wars have rebuilt the two reservoirs of the disease: biting flies and untreated people.</p>
        <p>And a new outbreak has begun in Uganda's southeast, said Dr. Dowson S. Mbulamberi, who heads the Ugandan Health Ministry's efforts against vector-borne diseases like sleeping sickness. His is a daunting task. Uganda's health budget amounts to $12 per citizen per year, less than the cost of one tsetse fly trap.</p>
        <p>Sleeping sickness is actually far too benign a name for human African trypanosomiasis. It is spread by the bite of tsetse fly, the scissor-winged glossina species found from Senegal to Somalia to South Africa. In its saliva, the small fly injects a protozoan that it picks up from feasting on another infected person.</p>
        <p>The symptoms start with low fevers, itchy skin, joint pain and lethargy. But weeks later, when the parasites enter the brain, patients begin hallucinating or acting wildly. They have been known to chase family members with machetes, shout all night, throw themselves into latrines, and pillage other villagers' plots of cassava or bananas to feed ravenous appetites. Their skins get so sensitive that cool water or a gentle touch makes them scream. Only at the end do they lapse into a lassitude so great that they cannot feed themselves. Then they sink into a coma and die.</p>
        <p>At one time, British tsetse control reportedly included ''fly boys'' -- young men who stood shirtless in the bush slapping flies and were paid a bounty for each killed. Because the fly likes dense brush near water, the illness particularly affects women and the babies they carry on their backs as they collect water or wash clothes. If infected, even babies must suffer melarsoprol treatment.</p>
        <p>Witchcraft Blamed, Too</p>
        <p>Villagers fear sleeping sickness so much that some laboratory workers say they are testing for malaria, which is known to be treatable. In the villages, rumors say it is spread by eating pork, by sex and by witchcraft, said Martin Andama, who visits villages to test people for the disease as part of a Doctors Without Borders program.</p>
        <p>Jovina Oleru, a woman who was cured and returned to nurse her son, still stubbornly believes that she is sick because her family is angry at her husband.</p>
        <p>''My husband only paid three cattle for me when I got married, and I have given him three children,'' she said. ''So my family really got nothing for bride-wealth, and they feel bad about me and perhaps wish me to die.''</p>
        <p>That, she indicated, made more sense to her than the idea that flies make humans sick.</p>
        <p>''Hospitalization'' here is cheap; the 60-foot-long ward has a cement floor, brick walls, a straw roof and plastic sheeting for windows. Patients are charged nothing, but each has to bring an ''attendant'' from home, who sleeps on the floor, collects firewood and cooks over a fire in the brick hut in the field outside.</p>
        <p>One day recently Alfred M. Guma, 32, a farmer who grows sorghum and tobacco on his small plot near Omugo, smoothed the rough blanket on his cot in the ward where he was waiting out the 21-day stay required for melarsoprol treatment. He was in Stage 2, meaning the parasites had reached the spinal fluid bathing his brain, which is serious, though the disease had been caught early.</p>
        <p>''My brother Steven had a mental breakdown,'' he said. ''He began to see things that others could not see --  wild animals, dead people coming to him at night. He feared having a bath and became aggressive if you touched him, jumping back as if he had touched fire.''</p>
        <p>For 14-year-old Steven, the family finally improvised an ambulance: they used old clothing to tie him into a box on wheels behind a bicycle and took him to a hospital. That was five years ago; Steven, cured, is now in high school.</p>
        <p>Only four drugs are known to work against sleeping sickness and all four are in trouble. Their problems show how the open marketplace that works so well for Americans still fails the world's poor.</p>
        <p>One is from Bayer, the German pharmaceutical giant. Three are made by Aventis, whose headquarters are in Strasbourg, France. That is a coincidence; Aventis was formed in mergers of French, German and American companies, three of which just happened to make drugs used against trypanosomiasis.</p>
        <p>At $50 for a course of treatment,  melarsoprol is relatively inexpensive, and Aventis has promised to keep making it for as long as needed.</p>
        <p>''But it's a terrible drug -- you don't feel proud injecting it,'' said Dr. Christine Genevier, director of the Doctors Without Borders program in Uganda. ''It's caustic, it burns them, and you don't know if you are going to save your patient or kill them.''</p>
        <p>Now a strain of melarsoprol-resistant sleeping sickness is spreading. Up to a quarter of the Omugo patients have it, so even if they survive the painful injections they may die anyway.</p>
        <p>''It's a risky product,'' admitted Alain Aumonier, director of international corporate policy for Aventis. ''We won't claim the opposite.''</p>
        <p>The second drug, Eflornithine, known as DFMO and sold under the name Ornidyl, is the best treatment for melarsoprol-resistant patients. Originally developed as an anticancer drug, its usefulness against sleeping sickness was uncovered by chance in the 1980's; it proved so spectacular at pulling people out of their final comas that it was nicknamed ''the Resurrection Drug.''</p>
        <p>But it is expensive, about $210 per course. Worse, the manufacturer, an American subsidiary of Aventis,  abandoned the compound in 1995 when it proved ineffective against cancer.</p>
        <p>Last year, pressed by the W.H.O. and Doctors Without Borders, whose supply was running out, the company found 500 pounds of a precursor chemical in Indianapolis and made one last batch of 7,800 vials. The chemical is difficult to work with because it is unstable and corrodes piping; assuring a steady supply would mean building a whole new production line, Mr. Aumonier said, which the company declines to do.</p>
        <p>Instead, in December, it signed the patent rights over to the W.H.O., which is seeking a new manufacturer. An Egyptian candidate proved unable to meet quality standards. A Texas company offered to make it at $60 a vial, treble the old price. That is too much; the search goes on.</p>
        <p>A More Exciting Prospect</p>
        <p>Mr. Aumonier said Aventis made the last batch and turned over the patent out of a sense of charity. ''And now we feel trapped by what we've done,'' he said. ''We are reproached for not doing enough when we could have done nothing.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, to the disgust of Dr. Pecoul, interest in the precursor chemical has suddenly soared because it might prevent the growth of facial hair in women. Gillette, the razor company, is doing research on it, ''because they think it might be a huge market,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The third drug is Pentamidine, which is useful only against Stage 1, when the parasites are confined to the blood. Treatment takes only 10 days. Under the brand name Lomodine, the drug has been around since 1941. But in the AIDS epidemic of the 1980's it was slightly reformulated and renamed Pentacarinat, and its price soared from $1 a vial to $30 when it was found to work against pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, once one of the chief killers of people with AIDS.</p>
        <p>Despite the price increase, the manufacturer, a British company that became part of Aventis last year, has been supplying it free to the W.H.O. for use against trypanosomiasis. But last year, Mr. Aumonier and health agency officials said,  Aventis told the W.H.O. it wanted to raise the price gradually to market level, probably $14 a vial, by the year 2004. The health agencies protested and the company is reconsidering, Mr. Aumonier said.</p>
        <p>Finally, there is Suramin, made by Bayer, which has been used since 1920, also only against Stage 1. It costs less than $50 per course of treatment.</p>
        <p>It has no other uses, so, a 1999 W.H.O. report said, ''Bayer wished to stop production, but maintained it on the grounds that no other alternatives were available.''</p>
        <p>Franz-Jozef Bohle, a Bayer spokesman, said the company was trying to be a good corporate citizen, and was discussing the supply of three drugs for tropical diseases with the W.H.O.</p>
        <p>Pharmaceutical industry executives say they cannot be expected to shoulder the burden of diseases of the poor alone. ''The industry has never been philanthropic,'' said Mr. Gros, the Aventis spokesman. ''It has always produced products with an aim to getting a return on investment.''</p>
        <p>If rich nations are unwilling to pay for drugs for poor ones, if poor countries continue to spend fortunes on weapons and if their doctors keep leaving to work in the West, he said, it is not the fault of the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
        <p>''I like that statement 'Access to medicine is a human right,' '' said Mr. Aumonier of Aventis, quoting an aphorism frequently used by health advocates. ''But it's a right that should be enforced by the whole community. May I suggest that the pharmaceutical industry is only part of that community? It also includes the health care system, the social system, even the patient.</p>
        <p>''What's to be done if the poor are too poor to buy drugs on the free market? Does government act sufficiently? To say to industry, 'You make money, so you must enforce this human right alone' -- this, somewhere, is wrong.''</p>
        <p>The Cause of Chaos</p>
        <p>Mr. Bohle made a similar point, saying Bayer was willing to make some drugs available cheaply, but wiping out an epidemic took much more: hospitals, follow-up tests, record-keeping, tsetse fly control and other elements.</p>
        <p>Daniel Berman, who works with Dr. Pecoul at Doctors Without Borders, said he was troubled by such industry arguments. ''O.K., they didn't actually cause the problem,'' he said. ''But are they an important factor in the drugs not being produced? Absolutely.''</p>
        <p>''When we're there we can distribute them,'' he said. ''The limiting factor for us is price. But when a company abandons a drug, there's chaos.''</p>
        <p>Taking account of the trend of the last decade in which many companies have been forced into mergers because their relatively low stock prices made them tempting targets to competition, Mr. Bohle conceded that Bayer did little research on tropical disease.</p>
        <p>''You have to relativize this,'' he said. ''A company can support some research without being paid off, but not much. Especially with the pressure on shareholder value. I remember when shareholder value was not important at all, and now it's the main driver. There's always the threat of being taken over.''</p>
