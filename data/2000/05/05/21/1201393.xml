        <p>Mike Piazza sauntered through the hallways of Intermediate School 252 in Brooklyn on Friday afternoon, flanked by two police officers, wondering what he was even doing there. The cops told Piazza how too many kids from the area wind up joining gangs, selling drugs and forgetting that school exists. They thanked Piazza for visiting Brownsville and bringing a hopeful message.</p>
        <p>But Piazza privately questioned how qualified he was to be lecturing the 500 boys and girls perched in front of him with eager eyes. They had dozens of questions. Did Piazza have a girlfriend? What kind of car did he drive? When did he know he wanted to be a baseball player? How hard was it to blast a homer? The kids raised their hands to the sky and peppered Piazza with questions for almost an hour.</p>

        <p>Mike Piazza sauntered through the hallways of Intermediate School 252 in Brooklyn on Friday afternoon, flanked by two police officers, wondering what he was even doing there. The cops told Piazza how too many kids from the area wind up joining gangs, selling drugs and forgetting that school exists. They thanked Piazza for visiting Brownsville and bringing a hopeful message.</p>
        <p>But Piazza privately questioned how qualified he was to be lecturing the 500 boys and girls perched in front of him with eager eyes. They had dozens of questions. Did Piazza have a girlfriend? What kind of car did he drive? When did he know he wanted to be a baseball player? How hard was it to blast a homer? The kids raised their hands to the sky and peppered Piazza with questions for almost an hour.</p>
        <p>Still, Piazza was waiting for one of these precocious kids to ask him the type of question that would have made him antsy: You grew up in a safe suburb with a father who developed into a multimillionaire. Both your parents were solid influences in your life. Now you make $13 million a year. Please explain how you know anything about the harrowing experiences we encounter every day.</p>
        <p>''Who am I?'' Piazza said, asking the question himself. ''I'm this big rich athlete, but how do I know what they're going through? What can I tell them? I came from a stable family and we lived in a nice neighborhood. I didn't have a lot of the problems these kids deal with.''</p>
        <p>Piazza talked about addressing these kids as if he was discussing a tense game, a game like yesterday's wild 8-7 victory over the Diamondbacks. The Mets had an 8-0 cushion after seven innings and an 8-2 bulge going to the ninth, but the unreliable Rich Rodriguez was battered, John Franco did not tidy up the mess, and Armando Benitez was needed to strike out Erubiel Durazo with two men on. This would have been a titanic collapse, so Benitez's save was huge.</p>
        <p>''It got a little scary at the end,'' Bobby Valentine said, ''but that's the way baseball is.''</p>
        <p>Mike Hampton won his third straight start with six scoreless innings and credited his attitude adjustment for the transformation. Hampton is not trying to impress anyone and is simply pitching. Eventually, Piazza made that sort of attitude adjustment with the kids at I.S. 252. Eventually, Piazza said that he felt a connection while simply being himself.</p>
        <p>You have options, Piazza told the students. You should focus on education and resist hanging out in the streets, he said. Piazza never acted as if he had lived in anything similar to their shoes, but he mentioned the adversity he faced as a 62nd-round draft choice and how he persevered to play baseball.</p>
        <p>''All I wanted to do was give them a push,'' Piazza said. ''That's all some of these kids want. I'm not saying that will solve everything. But you want to let them know that they have options and that there are people who care.''</p>
        <p>As Piazza reeled off the names of schools in Harlem and Brooklyn and discussed their educational programs, he sounded like a person who genuinely cared. He sounded more like a seasoned New Yorker than a 31-year-old superstar who lives in Cresskill, N.J. Other than the Brooklyn native John Franco, how many Mets could name one school in the five boroughs?</p>
        <p>Piazza is the superstar who fits the Mets the way empty pizza boxes fit a dorm room after a party. He is batting .362 after going 1 for 3 in yesterday's soggy game and he had a two-run homer in Friday's 4-3 victory. The Diamondbacks swiped seven bases in the series opener and Piazza has nailed only 5 of 40 would-be base stealers. Valentine minimized the stolen bases as though they were used rosin bags, but Piazza's chronic throwing woes cannot be dismissed so easily.</p>
        <p>''A catcher has got to throw the ball on the base,'' Piazza said. ''I haven't been doing that.''</p>
        <p>The fans no longer boo Piazza, as they did when he arrived from the Florida Marlins in a trade exactly two years ago tomorrow. Piazza struggled, and the fans treated him  like a pariah. Still, Piazza believes the experience with the fickle fans made him stronger, one more story he could have told the kids.</p>
        <p>''That was a challenge, something I had to overcome,'' Piazza said. ''There were times when I could have said: 'The heck with this. I'm out of here at the end of the year.' But I knew if I kept playing hard every day, people would see what kind of player I was and respect me. They had to get used to me, and I had to get used to them.''</p>
        <p>Piazza now is comfortable enough to eloquently explain why he thinks New York has changed for the better. He scoffed at the reputation New Yorkers have for being nasty and said he noticed generosity when in the city. That is how Piazza, the permanent Met, should be viewed, too: as a New Yorker who cares.</p>
        <p>''Now I'm a fixture here,'' Piazza said. ''I'm not running away from any of my responsibilities, but it's good to be able to come here and not always have to be the guy every day. It's nice to fit in and do what I need to do.''</p>
