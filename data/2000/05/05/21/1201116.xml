        <p>When 7,000 students at Rutgers receive their degrees on Tuesday, 15-year-old Shant Sarkuni will be there too -- the university's second-youngest graduate ever. He would have been the youngest graduate but his cousin, Hannes Sarkuni, who graduated in 1996, was 14 at the time. The  third-youngest graduate was Hannes's brother Sehrope, who graduated from Rutgers last year at the age of 15 (at his graduation he was two months older than Shant is now).</p>
        <p>Though all three are college graduates -- or are about to be -- none went to high school. They went to college after seventh or eighth grade, and and graduated in four years with highest honors. Shant became a full-time university student at the age of 12 and was named to the dean's list every semester.</p>
        <p>Majoring in mathematics and computer sciences, the three young graduates are keeping the close family ties their parents started. Hannes and Sehrope founded a computer software company, Metaprime, to write programs for Wall Street firms to manage trades. Shant already has joined them in the business, which is based in Cranbury, where both families live within a couple of miles of each other.</p>
        <p>Sarko Sarkuni, a computer programmer and the father of Hannes and Sehrope, said: ''They started the company against my advice, because I thought it was too much responsibility for them, but Hannes worked with me for a while. Then he wanted to do it on his own, so now I help them with the business.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkuni and his brother, Moses, who are Armenian, married two sisters after both families immigrated to the United States from the same village in Lebanon about 1970.</p>
        <p>''I don't think they are a lot smarter than other children,'' Mr. Sarkuni said. ''They had good opportunities. What we want them to accomplish is to be very decent human beings and to be respectful. That is all we expect of them.''</p>
        <p>Both families have a 13-year-old girl and a 10-year-old-boy at home, whom the cousins try to encourage as much as possible.</p>
        <p>Shant said he had no plans to attend graduate school, at least not until he had worked with his cousins for a few years.</p>
        <p>''I want to get a few years of work under my belt, and I want to be a kid and have fun,'' said Shant, who enjoys all kinds of music and hanging out with friends his own age.</p>
        <p>''At first it was hard to make friends in classes, but after a year or so, you do,'' said Shant. ''I don't think it was much different from regular high school. The worst part is not being able to drive around.''</p>
