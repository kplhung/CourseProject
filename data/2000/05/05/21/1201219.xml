        <p>Roy Dean is as well polished as a mahogany rail, a sharp man in a stiletto suit. He wears a clean chin, a wide-brimmed hat and wingtip shoes. In his pockets he carries a cigarette holder, a kerchief and a stack of small pink raffle tickets:</p>
        <p>A Pre-Mother's Day Cocktail Sip</p>
        <p>Saturday May 13, 2000</p>
        <p>John's Recovery Room</p>
        <p>535 Lenox Avenue</p>
        <p>1st Prize ---------Woman's Diamond Ring</p>
        <p>2nd Prize ---------$200</p>
        <p>3rd Prize ---------$100</p>
        <p>Donation: $2 per ticket</p>
        <p>Donation: $9 per book</p>
        <p>(Winner Need Not Be Present)</p>
        <p>Roy Dean was the sponsor of the raffle and the event was held for the benefit of himself. To the charitable-minded this may smack of rank self-centeredness, but Mr. Dean sees it differently. ''Can't think of no one more needy than me,'' he says, ''and it's a whole lot better than working.''</p>
        <p>It is known around the Harlem gin mills that Mr. Dean is a refugee from the shoulder-to-the-grindstone workaday world. It is also known that around the major holidays there is money to be made. So this rakish man will slip into his suit, button down his solicitude and go from bar stool to bar stool peddling tickets with all the importance of a life insurance salesman.</p>
        <p>''You need something for the future and I'm trying to offer you that future right here for a mere $2,'' he tells an elderly patron of the Princess Lounge at West 116th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue. Many  don't buy. They suspect the diamond is a dupe and the cash prizes predestined for the pockets of Mr. Dean's distant relatives. But many do. These sales can be laid to the greed of retirees or the jumbled judgment of the intoxicated.</p>
        <p>Then there is another type of buyer. Mr. Dean is thin, excitable and hungry looking, and some white people drinking uptown are flustered by his staccato hard sell. Mr. Dean can often sell them a book of tickets, secure in the knowledge they will not show up on raffle day.</p>
        <p>It is a clean bit of alchemy as Mr. Dean transforms five pink slips of paper into two whisky-and-sodas and a $5 bill.</p>
        <p>The pre-Mother's Day cocktail sip does in fact take place, at John's Recovery Room, a rundown bar on 137th Street, just up the block from Harlem Hospital. Men sell seafood on the corner and customers must show their faces in the plate glass before being buzzed in. The place is decorated with foil and balloons, and a tub of fried chicken cools on the back table. It is a friendly crowd: cocktail hour for the elderly and retired runs from 2 to 9.</p>
        <p>First draw is called for 5:30, but 5:30 comes and goes. Mr. Dean, distracted,  darts in and out, and the evening falls behind schedule. The draw is pushed to 7, then 9. The chicken grows cold and the old people sleepy; 10 o'clock and still waiting.</p>
        <p>A man named Franklin can take it no more. After drinking for hours, he makes his way to the door. ''The chicken's turned to rubber and so's my legs,'' he said. ''Hope my old bird ain't waiting up for that ring.''</p>
        <p>The prizes were raffled off in the early morning hours, the bartender says. The winner of the diamond was a big woman and the ring did not fit.</p>
