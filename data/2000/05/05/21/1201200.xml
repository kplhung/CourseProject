        <p>SUMMERTIME -- and the reading is supposed to be easy. Or at least, that's how it is for adults, who head off to the shore or lake retreat with nothing more taxing than the latest best-selling paperback.</p>
        <p>Not so for schoolchildren. Although there are no state-required summer reading lists, individual districts may require their students to read specific titles before returning to school in September.</p>
        <p>In other communities, teachers and librarians distribute extensive lists with recommended reading -- where even Harry Potter has its place -- that they hope students will consider. For the past five years, the governor's office has promoted the Governor's Summer Reading Challenge as part of an effort to encourage summer reading.</p>
        <p>''We try to involve all parts of the communities, including libraries, to make it as public as possible,'' said Christine Sullivan, an English language arts consultant for the State Department of Education. Last summer, in fact, 180,000 children read a total of one million books.</p>
        <p>Following is a selected listing of some reading possibilities, culled from familiar childhood classics and bedtime favorites to more contemporary, popular choices. In some cases, especially at the high school level, best-seller lists and school reading lists are almost identical, so parents may end up borrowing their children's summer reading for their own entertainment. Keep in mind that, with school in session for another month, there may be changes and modifications to some of these lists before summer break begins.</p>
        <p>Greenwich High School, Greenwich</p>
        <p>Students are expected to select any two books from a list targeted for the college bound, and prepare notecards to answer specific questions. There is flexibility and choice: students may choose among novels, short stories, history or autobiography and biography.</p>
