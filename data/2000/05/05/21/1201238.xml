        <p>I HAVE never understood celebrities who wipe their eyes and lament the terrible cost of fame -- no privacy, no job security, never knowing if someone likes them for who they are.</p>
        <p>Please. No one knows the whole truth about why -- or if -- other people like us. Are they deeply enamored with the innermost core of our being, or just impressed with our access to the Lincoln Bedroom?</p>
        <p>Still, it must be grating when one person after another whom you haven't seen since the late 80's -- an ex, a long-lost pal, a passing acquaintance -- calls ''just to say 'Hi,' '' but also just as your stock, real or figurative, happens to be soaring. Even I, hovering somewhere between Nobody and Next to Nobody on the fame scale, find people getting in touch after they have read something I have written.</p>
        <p>Usually, of course, I am happy to hear from them. I would be considerably less pleased if they asked me for money, which is the often-unspoken point of calls that descend unbidden on dot-com millionaires and others among the newly celebrated.</p>
        <p>''After a Boston Globe article about me, I received 58 phone calls from stockbrokers, real estate people and charities asking for money,'' said Ben Mezrich, 30, whose newfound wealth came from a breakthrough as a novelist.</p>
        <p>Since 1996, Mr. Mezrich, whose  pen name is Holden Scott, has sold six books, all for six-figure advances. Along the way, he said, he  traded his ''dumpy'' apartment in Boston for ''a cool one on the 26th floor,'' acquired a 63-inch television with a $12,000 sound system and garbed himself in $20,000 of Armani clothing. His calls came from struggling writers, from agents and editors who previously ignored him, and from a few mothers of daughters who ache to date a writer. (The disadvantages of dating writers, of course, are a different column.)</p>
        <p>Ever since Peter Klamka, 31, of Ann Arbor, Mich., saw his net worth climb to somewhere between $4 million and $30 million, he has heard from many people. ''I've gotten calls from old friends and girlfriends, from people who passed on the deal -- lots of 'I-should-haves,' 'if onlys' and 'I didn't think you could pull it offs,' '' said Mr. Klamka, the founder of PTN Media, a publicly held company that produces and distributes fashion, style and beauty-related content for Web sites. That's not to mention ''college buddies, mostly lawyers, who want me to bring them on as an in-house counsel for a huge salary and lots of cheap options,'' he added.</p>
        <p>What brings them out of the woodwork? ''People can find out anything quickly and easily via the Internet,'' he said. ''They see that I have two-million-plus shares of PTN, and they look at the price of the stock and just assume I can access that amount with my A.T.M. card.</p>
        <p>''Everyone thinks you're a V.C,'' he added, referring to a venture capitalist. ''They have deals, inventions, various business opportunities that range from nightclubs to car washes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Klamka has not yet invested in any of that; most of what he has seen have been ''wild dreams with no shot of success -- their idea, my money and Rolodex and they get all the profits if it works,'' he said. But he is not opposed to helping someone if there is a viable plan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mezrich has done things like paying a friend's rent, and he picks up checks at nightclubs without expecting others to ever do the same. ''It feels weird asking for cash from someone who I know doesn't have it,'' he said, ''when I've got three books on the shelves right now.''</p>
        <p>DO people like him merely for his financial status? He is philosophical. ''I'm not concerned with people's motivations,'' he said. ''If they like me because I'm a successful writer, well, that's part of who I am. If they like me because I go to Paris for $10,000 weekends, that's part of who I am, too.''</p>
        <p>He is not a fool. He knows the phone may stop ringing if the inkwell dries up. ''That's the way of the world,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Perhaps. Luckily, the rest of us, without the dot-com millions or the six-figure advances, needn't worry our little heads about it. We know exactly why people like us: for our charm and scintillating wit -- or at least, our self-delusions.</p>
