        <p>Anyone who watched  the greenish videotape of bombs exploding during the Persian Gulf war and in Kosovo should be familiar with night-vision viewers, which allow soldiers to see in very low light. Now, ITT Night Vision, the primary producer of night optics for the armed forces, is offering models from $1,895 to $3,845 in outdoor-equipment stores for adventurers ready to battle the elements, instead of an enemy. The devices create the illusion of daylight by capturing and intensifying available light on an interior phosphor screen (like a video screen). Lakota River Guides rafting trips use the viewers for moonlight runs down the rapids of the Colorado River, and Texas River and Jeep Expeditions offers after-dark desert Jeep tours in Big Bend National Park, the better to spot cactuses and the occasional desert pig.</p>

        <p>But do the viewers work in other wild environments, like New York's night scene? I toured dim bars in Lower Manhattan with a yellow Night Mariner 260 model. While halos and dots appeared around light sources, the viewer was helpful for seeing normally shadowy paintings, people watching, finding bathrooms and, the ultimate challenge, sparking conversation.</p>
