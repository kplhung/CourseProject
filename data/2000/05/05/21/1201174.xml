        <p>THE tens of thousands of tourists who troop onto Long Island invariably gravitate to restaurants to savor the season, particularly places that offer outdoor, waterfront and water-view dining. Unfortunately, such locations, especially prime by-the-sea  sites, are expensive and the cost of such real estate is passed on to patrons in the form of high food prices.</p>
        <p>Yet many in-the-know, year-round residents find the foods of summer without experiencing budgetary meltdown. Summer on a shoestring dining can be pursued on two gently priced paths. First, there are weather-beaten fish markets offering fresh seafood, funky little outdoor ethnic spots, rough and tumble country roadhouses and ramshackle near-the-water old favorites, specializing in simple, satisfying seafood dishes. Another possibility exists for those with a good eye and self-restraint: creating an upscale experience for a downscale price by carefully scrutinizing the menus of more glamorous, atmospheric eating places.</p>

        <p>THE tens of thousands of tourists who troop onto Long Island invariably gravitate to restaurants to savor the season, particularly places that offer outdoor, waterfront and water-view dining. Unfortunately, such locations, especially prime by-the-sea  sites, are expensive and the cost of such real estate is passed on to patrons in the form of high food prices.</p>
        <p>Yet many in-the-know, year-round residents find the foods of summer without experiencing budgetary meltdown. Summer on a shoestring dining can be pursued on two gently priced paths. First, there are weather-beaten fish markets offering fresh seafood, funky little outdoor ethnic spots, rough and tumble country roadhouses and ramshackle near-the-water old favorites, specializing in simple, satisfying seafood dishes. Another possibility exists for those with a good eye and self-restraint: creating an upscale experience for a downscale price by carefully scrutinizing the menus of more glamorous, atmospheric eating places.</p>
        <p>Bistro Blue, in the Sterling Harbor Marina, at 1410 Manhasset Avenue in Greenport (631-477-3940), falls midway between these two routes. Its commendable food, sharp young servers, waterfront site and spectacular marina and harbor views make it appear more expensive than it is.  This summery, year-old East End entry is a place of sun-bright yellow walls and deep blue ceilings. The restaurant's many picture windows offer diners a floor show, boats gliding in and out of the marina.</p>
        <p>A big bowl of the soup of the day costs $5, meal-sized hand rolls or wraps, served with salad or French fries, go for $6 to $9, six-slice pizzas are in the $7-to-$9 range, pastas are  $10 to $14, four of the six desserts cost $5 or $6 and meat or fish entrees start at $14.</p>
        <p>Among the blue-ribbon appetizers were a peppy, refreshing gazpacho ($5); a warm goat-cheese salad ($8) resting in a tangy toasted-tomato vinaigrette that boasts four or five types of lettuce (none of them iceberg); a couple of lively seasoned no-filler crab cakes ($8) served with  savory corn salsa and vibrant remoulade sauce and a New Yorker entree-sized pizza ($8) large enough to be an appetizer for four.</p>
        <p>Bonbori, a Japanese gem at 14 Elm Street in Huntington (631-673-0400), isn't a bargain, but it is a beauty, especially the enchanting Asian garden behind the restaurant. Thrifty diners can concentrate on page one of the menu, with its skewered seafood, vegetable and tofu appetizers and its soups, salads and noodle entrees, all of which are priced from $3.50 to $9.50.</p>
        <p>During the warm weather months, except on nasty days, that garden is the restaurant. Diners enter through wooden pagoda-style doors and walk a path lined with plants, lanterns and Japanese artifacts to the secluded garden, which is bordered by rhododendron, shaded by trees, with its  and soothed by the sound of gently trickling water.</p>
        <p>Mix, match and share the starters, sushi and entrees from the restaurant's pocket-sized kitchen. The bold and fresh Bonbori salad ($6.50) blends its standard lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and endive with raisins, walnuts, bacon bits and shredded daikon (white radish) and carrots. The salad serves four, as does  the bowl of udon ($9) with its thick, white noodles presented either in a  hot broth or chilled dipping sauce.</p>
        <p>Another opener for four, found on the separate sushi and sashimi menu, is the $7 sampler containing four pieces made from that day's freshest ingredients. (Tuna, fluke, sea bass and silk snapper one day with not a clunker in the bunch).  Recommended appetizers are six oysters age-dashi ($8.25), shrimp-vegetable tempura $6.75), sauteed vegetables ($6.25), angry shrimp ($9), yakitori (($6.25) and shrimp kushi ($8.25). The batter on the fried oysters is not the ho-hum bread crumb variety, but kuzu starch.  Speaking of batter, the feathery, crisp-covered tempura shrimp and vegetables is as good as it gets. Those four angry shrimp, pan fried in egg batter, sported a vibrant, though not incendiary, ginger sauce.</p>
        <p>The Cull House is a seafood shack near the Fire Island Ferry in Sayville that serves consistently good food at easy-to-take prices. Keep it simple with straightforward American fish dishes and you will be rewarded. This rustic, 17-year-old spot, at 75 Terry Street (631-563-1546), has undergone some sprucing up during the off season, but its down-to-earth nautical ambience (ship's wheels, lobster aquarium, mounted fish, ship boat models) remains.</p>
        <p>So do the bargain prices. Although a one-and-a-quarter pound lobster dinner is listed at $14.95, a lobster  can be purchased during ''Lobster Madness'' every Monday through Thursday for $8.99. An additional $1.95 buys vegetables and potatoes, resulting in a $10.94 meal. During the first four days of the week, when ''Shrimp Silliness'' is in effect, patrons can purchase seven lightly breaded jumbos for $6.99.</p>
        <p>Artie's South Shore Fish and Grill, near the water in Island Park, is wedged in sideways along Austin Boulevard (4257 Austin, 516-889-0692). It opened 25 years ago as a fish market. It still is, but two years ago Artie Hoerning, who always caught most of the fish, expanded and opened an unpretentious little cafe.  He recently hired Jared L. Binns of Long Beach, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America who has worked at Mulligan's at Hampton Bays, Borderline Cafe, the Discerning Palate and Villa Lombardi.</p>
        <p>You can't eat much fresher fish than those at Artie's. And that's the way to go. Tuna is $11.95, swordfish $12.95, salmon $8.95, halibut $9.95 and whole broiled fluke $10.95. All are cooked with a vigilance and respect that many local restaurants, including fancy ones, have yet to master..</p>
        <p>Ignore the two tables in front of the Hampton Chutney Company, at 74 Montauk Highway in Amagansett (631-267-3131), that make it look like just another hot dog and hamburger drive-in. Instead, go behind the building to the lovely 12-acre, landscaped garden of the adjacent Bayberry Nursery, where interesting, sometimes exotic Indian and American dishes are served at six picnic tables.</p>
        <p>Many of the dosas (airy sourdough crepes made with rice and white lentil flour), uttapas (pancake-like dosas made with the same ingredients) and sandwiches feature fresh cilantro, tomato, mango, curry, peanut and pumpkin chutneys. A good place to start is the basic Masala dosa ($6.50), a warm crepe, about 10 inches long, that is wrapped around a savory spiced (though not spicy) potato filling. The most expensive items on the menu cost $10.50.</p>
        <p>Paddy McGee's is the fish house in everyone's mind's eye, with its dark wood paneling, checkered tablecloths, aproned waiters, life preservers and lobster aquarium. An authentic seaside touch is added by its waterfront locale on the Reynolds Channel in Island Park.</p>
        <p>Fortunately Paddy McGee's, at 6 Waterview Road (516-431-8700), isn't as expensive as it looks. Although appetizers can cost as much as $8.95 and fish dishes top out at $18.50, two diners can enjoy a light, lovely meal by ordering the feast of the sea ($12.50 a person). This briny array of shellfish from the raw bar contains 10 fresh clams and 9 pristine oysters on the half shell, 8 peel-and-eat shrimp, 5 mussels, 2 tender sea scallops and a clump of tangy calamari.  It is preceded by a substantial plate of carrots, celery, new pickles, cabbage and olives, long reedy bread sticks and warm bread. Add a soda or ice tea for $1.50 or a glass of wine for a bit more and you have an ideal summer on a shoestring dinner.</p>
        <p>For those who crave more, there are bowls of peppy Manhattan clam chowder and soothing New England clam chowder ($3.50). Two gently priced fish entrees are worth ordering: mild broiled New England scrod ($14.95) and savory seared brook trout ($15.50).</p>
        <p>The wide wrap-around deck at Steamboat Landing faces the Jude Thaddeus Glen Cove Marina and straddles Glen Cove Creek. The setting, at 76 Shore Road, Glen Cove (516-759-3921), is perhaps the loveliest, low-priced possibility for waterside dining on the Island.</p>
        <p>Midday on Sunday is one of the best times for a visit. The $16.95 brunch, which includes drinks, is being scaled back to $12.95 (without alcoholic beverages) this summer.  Tthe brunch is a retro buffet that offers predictable choices of ordinary fare -- fettucine a la vodka, eggplant parmigiana, breaded pork cutlets, sausage and onions, fried potatoes, made-to-order omelets, chicken in wine sauce, bagels, Jell-O and fruit salad.</p>
        <p>Also available is the bar menu. Its choices, which are actually the appetizers from the evening menu,  present more discriminating patrons with a somewhat more sophisticated selection at almost equally affordable prices. Those who opt for quality over quantity will want to share the cold antipasto ($7.95) with its array of tomato, cheese, mushrooms, pepperoni, roasted red peppers, caponata and mozzarella. The seven tiny baked clams ($8.95), topped with tasty oreganata crumbs, is another good choice and the four jumbos in the somewhat pricey shrimp cocktail ($11.95) are first rate.</p>
        <p>Two salads, the Caesar ($6.75 and $11.25, with grilled chicken) and the house ($5.50 and $9.95 with chicken) took top honors. Both the Caesar, a cascade of fresh romaine, homemade croutons and creamy Parmesan dressing presented in a pastry seashell container and the house, a large tangle of tender baby greens with a good red wine vinaigrette were substantial enough to share, especially when they are topped with a generous helping of chicken.</p>
        <p>Although its open-air deck, next to an often active boat-filled creek is the choicest spot at Steamboat Landing, the airy dining room with its high ceiling and many windows, is a desirable bad-weather alternative that also offers a marine vista.</p>
        <p>When a mist rises from the Great South Bay or its waves cast a spray along the shoreline, they reach Babylon Fish and Clam, a half block from the water at 458 Fire Island Avenue in Babylon (631-587-3633).</p>
        <p>It opened 33 years ago as a clam shack and remains a rustic knotty pine kind of placey, despite expansion that includes a restaurant, a fish market, an open deck with umbrellas, a covered porch and a clam bar -- all determinedly nautical in decor.</p>
        <p>Savvy patrons target the basics.  They order starters like the spirited, highly seasoned, dense-with-ingredients Manhattan clam chowder and the thick, rich New England clam chowder (both $1.95 cup, $2.95 bowl), or the shrimp cocktail with its six shrimp for only $5.95 and the 18 or so big chowder-type steamers for $6.95.</p>
        <p>Entrees make appetizers unnecessary since their price includes either of the chowders or garden salad and a choice of baked potato, French fries, onion rings and vegetables. Some of the least expensive entrees are among the best, including crisp, greaseless fried clam strips ($9.95).  Flat fish range from $10.95 (broiled or fried codfish) to $18.95 for specials like striped bass provencale.</p>
        <p>To experience summer on Long Island, order a bottle of white wine for $13, pair it with a dozen clams on the half shell ($8), that shrimp cocktail or fried clams and head for the open-air deck.</p>
