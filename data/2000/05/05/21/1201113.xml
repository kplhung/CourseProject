      <block class="full_text">
        <p>WHEN brownstones were constructed on block after block of Brooklyn in the late 19th century, they provided housing for well-to-do people whose live-in servants, usually immigrants from Italy, Ireland or Germany, would dust the intricately carved moldings and cook in the ground-floor kitchens, sending food upstairs to the dining room by dumbwaiter.</p>
        <p>Eventually though, brownstones  in much of Brooklyn became associated with the working class, and then the poor, who moved in when the buildings were divided into rooming houses. People with money, by and large, didn't want brownstones in Brooklyn; they wanted to live in apartment buildings in Manhattan or houses in the suburbs.</p>
        <p>All that of course has changed. Brownstones are chic. They're appreciated. And of course they're appreciating. Houses that were affordable to the middle class not long ago are now homes for the rich, some selling for $1.1 million and more in well-established brownstone neighborhoods like Park Slope, and  $750,000 in Fort Greene and Clinton Hill.</p>
        <p>There is however, a section of Brooklyn that is close to Manhattan and still has hundreds of town houses and brownstones occupied by regular working and professional people: Bedford-Stuyvesant. To the people who live there, mostly African-Americans or those with Caribbean roots, it is a tight-knit, family-oriented community that has been saddled with a negative image that does not reflect the reality there.</p>
        <p>To real estate brokers it is a gold mine, just waiting to be discovered by newcomers who have no idea of its charms, of its thousands of historic homes just 15 minutes on the A train from downtown Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Everett H. Ortner, chairman of the citywide Brownstone Revival Coalition, says Bed-Stuy may have as many as 6,000 brownstones, perhaps more than any other neighborhood. ''The quality is superb,'' he said. When houses go on the market,  brokers say they are often priced at less than $300,000.</p>
        <p>Walking the streets of Bed-Stuy, it feels like many other brownstone neighborhoods did 10 or 15 years ago, before they became home to chic little shops and restaurants. Lovely homes fill block after block, but the commercial activity consists mainly of beauty parlors, nail salons and other prosaic services and products.</p>
        <p>Some of the main commercial streets are dotted with vacant storefronts. On a hot day, it is hard to find a shop selling sandwiches or ice cream cones. ''You can go block after block and not see a grocery store,'' said Kenneth Adams, president of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. ''There's a lag on the commercial side.''</p>
        <p>That disparity between the quality of the housing and the variety of stores is something that is starting to change, and if it does in any significant way, the neighborhood will become more appealing to people who  associate city life with a convenient cup of coffee.</p>
        <p>Recently, local people have started the kinds of enterprises they want to patronize. Jean Williams-Cutler, a native of Jamaica, and her husband, Timothy Cutler, an Englishman, opened a small, casual restaurant  at the corner of Marcy and Putnam Avenues last fall called Doctor's Cave Cafe, after the beach in Jamaica where they met 11 years ago. Ms. Williams-Cutler said they decided to open a cafe in the building they have owned and lived in for 10 years because the space had been occupied by a ''greasy spoon'' and they believed the neighborhood needed better restaurants. Ms. Williams-Cutler, a nurse, and her husband, a lawyer, serve things like homemade pizza, quiche, roasted oxtail, pastas and curry.</p>
        <p>Not far away, on Lewis Avenue, Monique Greenwood and her husband, Glenn Pogue,  have bought a building with five commercial spaces, all to be rented by local entrepreneurs, and six apartments above. A  bookstore called Brownstone Books is scheduled to open, as is an antiques store called the Parlor Floor. And in July, when the new stores open, Ms. Greenwood and Mr. Pogue will start a cafe, named Mirrors by their 8-year-old daughter, Glynn, ''so people can come in and see their beauty,'' Ms. Greenwood said.</p>
        <p>They already own a restaurant on the same block, Akwaaba, opened two years ago, and a few blocks away on McDonough Street, the Akwaaba Mansion, where they cater to a bed-and-breakfast clientele in four elegantly furnished rooms in their 18-room house. ''Akwaaba'' means ''welcome'' in Ghana.</p>
        <p>MS. GREENWOOD, who is also the editor in chief of Essence magazine, said she and her husband became entranced with the neighborhood when they went on a tour of historic homes 11 years ago that was sponsored by the local Brownstoners. ''First we fell in love with the houses,'' Ms. Greenwood said, ''and then with the people who lived in the houses.'' The community, she said, ''has everything I would ever want, except some amenities.''</p>
        <p>Her passion for the neighborhood is typical among many of those who own the brownstones, many of them with their original details intact and some of them part of the official Stuyvesant Heights Historic District. It is not unusual to meet people in Bed-Stuy with extended family in their homes or on the same block. Houses tend to stay in the same family for decades.</p>
        <p>It is that stability that seems threatened by the sudden interest by brokers in selling the homes to people who are not from the neighborhood. Residents complain of aggressive door-to-door solicitations by brokers seeking listings, and offering to pay cash. Brokers who have for years done business in Bed-Stuy say they have to find more listings in the neighborhood to satisfy potential buyers who can't find anything they can afford in neighboring Clinton Hill or Fort Greene.</p>
        <p>Eva M. Daniels, who has her own real estate company in Fort Greene, says escalating prices have put houses in Clinton Hill and Fort Greene beyond the reach of many aspiring buyers. ''Bed-Stuy,'' she said, ''is a very hot community right now. I cannot tell you how many calls I get every day asking for Bed-Stuy.''</p>
        <p>But prices are rising quickly. She said she received a call from a mortgage broker recently looking for comparables for a house that was selling for $365,000. Last year, Ms. Daniels said, she sold eight houses in Bed-Stuy, and the one that went for $265,000 was considered high at the time.  Now, the same house might be $310,000.</p>
        <p>Right now, she said, ''I have three listings in Bed-Stuy, and it's not enough. I'm setting out to increase my listings. You write letters. You make calls. I know a lot of people. I get a lot of referrals.'' Her two grown sons live in the neighborhood, and she said it's a place that has ''only gotten better, and it was never as bad as people thought it was.''</p>
        <p>A few years ago, she said, people from outside the neighborhood were typically uninterested in renting there. Now, she said, she is renting floor-through apartments for $900 a month or so, and duplexes for as much as $1,800.</p>
        <p>Brokers say that people interested in Bed-Stuy rarely ask about schools, but that if clients do ask, the brokers refer them to books that evaluate local public schools.</p>
        <p>The area is also receiving a new focus from the Corcoran Group, a large and aggressive Manhattan-based broker that has been expanding its Brooklyn operations and  expects to open a new office in Fort Greene in late September. Jerry Minsky, who will be the managing director of downtown sales for that office, said Bed-Stuy has as many as 20 blocks in its historic district alone of ''fabulously intact town houses.''</p>
        <p>For the entire neighborhood, he estimates that the average selling price of a town house last year was $180,963, up from $156,006 the year before. He believes he has customers who can pay between $350,000 and $399,000 who would buy in Bed-Stuy because they can't afford Clinton Hill or Fort Greene, and they want ''museum condition'' brownstones.</p>
        <p>That is exactly the kind of price hike that will make it difficult for young people who have grown up in Bed-Stuy to remain. ''Bed-Stuy is a community of extended family,'' said Tohma Faulkner, a member of the Brownstoners of Bedford-Stuyvesant, the local group dedicated to preserving the old housing. She owns a house with her sister, which they share with their mother. ''Young people are having problems coming back,'' she said. ''My goddaughter is going to law school. When she comes back in three or four years to buy a house, she's priced out.''</p>
        <p>Bed-Stuy may not be known to outsiders for its tight community of brownstone owners, but that community has existed for years. ''There have always been middle-income and upper-income African-Americans there -- sophisticated, well-educated people,'' said Jerome Krase, chairman of the sociology department at Brooklyn College and the Murray Koppelman professor. But, he said, because of racism, and because Bed-Stuy was populated by blacks, ''people figured it was a slum.''</p>
        <p>The area has had a high percentage of poor people for decades, as well as problems with abandoned housing. But the city, as well as nonprofit groups like the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation and the Bridge Street Development Corporation,  have made progress toward solving some of those problems.</p>
        <p>The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development has, in partnership with nonprofit groups and developers, had 700 two-  and three-family houses built in Bed-Stuy in the last decade, and 2,800 housing units rehabilitated. The commissioner, Richard T. Roberts, said that the city had also encouraged retail development, particularly on Fulton Street, that has led to some services people in the neighborhood said they needed, like a sit-down restaurant, Choices by Oasis.</p>
        <p>The city has contracted with developers that have successfully renovated and resold most of the 79 brownstones that the city owned in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Charles Brass, president of the New York City Housing Partnership, said the buyers of the 900 new homes his group has completed are stable, employed people earning incomes up to $70,000. ''There haven't been any defaults to speak of,'' he said. ''In all of our projects, there's still strong demand.''</p>
        <p>THOSE houses let people know that the neighborhood is not being ignored. ''The infrastructure has gotten much better,'' said Bryant Johnson McInnis, who has published a book with photos and text about Bed-Stuy, called ''Glory in a Snapshot.''</p>
        <p>The rehab of vacant buildings has made a major change,'' said Mr. McInnis, a homeowner in the neighborhood who is the assistant director of Neighborhood Housing Services' Bed-Stuy office.</p>
        <p>The biggest change now needs to come in the commercial area, according to Charles Atwell, a longtime broker and property manager who owns Stuyvesant Heights Realty. Mr. Atwell is disappointed that more local people are not starting businesses. A space that's 900 square feet, he said, rents for only $1,200 a month. With the influx of brokers from elsewhere and the rising residential prices, he fears that when businesses do arrive to cater to the newcomers, they will be run by outsiders, or national chains.</p>
        <p>It is difficult to generalize about crime in Bedford-Stuyvesant, because the area is covered by several police precincts. But  crime figures for the first four and a half months of this year, a police spokesman said, show that incidences in all the major categories, like murder, robbery and burglary, are down from last year at the same time, for the area bounded by Fulton Street on the south, Halsey Street on the north, Tompkins Avenue on the west and Stuyvesant Avenue on the east, which includes the historic district. Only the incidence of rape has increased.</p>
        <p>The changes in Bed-Stuy are taking place in an area with strong block associations and so many churches that some blocks have more than one. In fact, it was the presence of the churches that led Laurie Cumbo to open Bed-Stuy's first museum this year.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cumbo, a graduate of Spelman College in Atlanta with a master's in arts administration from New York University, did her thesis on Bed-Stuy's ability to support a museum. Studies showed, she said, that people of African-American descent who attended museums regularly were also dedicated churchgoers. That was one thing that led her to believe that the community -- with by her count 82 churches -- was ripe for a museum.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cumbo, 25, circulated her thesis to local politicians and church groups and found interest from Bridge Street Church, a black congregation now located on Stuyvesant Avenue that was formed in 1766. This year, in 1,000 square feet of the church's newly renovated space, she opened Mocada, an acronym for Museum of Contemporary  African Diasporian Arts. Her current show, of work by Melvin Clark, attracted 300 people to its opening reception.</p>
        <p>The museum is just one outlet for artists. Some Bed-Stuy artists are showing their work through a relatively new group called  Sonya, which stands for South of the Navy Yard Artists. Gigi Stankiewicz, an artist who creates works based on the human genome project, lives on Classon Avenue in Bed-Stuy. Although people associate lofts with artists, she says brownstones provide good working space because of the high ceilings on the parlor floors.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stankiewicz moved to New York after receiving her master's degree from the Rhode Island School of Design, and says she is particularly charmed by Bed-Stuy because she lived in Newport for six years and  likes the historic houses and quiet streets in both places. ''There is a renaissance going on here,'' she said. ''Homes are getting fixed up. We're at the beginning.''</p>
        <p>Some of the significant art activity in Bed-Stuy isn't immediately obvious, but it is there, and growing. Benjamin and Elaine Antonetty recently opened an art gallery on the parlor floor of their Jefferson Avenue brownstone, which they bought two years ago. It had been a rooming house occupied by 13 tenants, many of them not even paying  rent, said Mr. Antonetty. Over a year, first by persuasion and then by legal action, he removed the tenants, and when they were gone began restoring the house.</p>
        <p>Now, their new home is a showplace. Mr. Antonetty worked as the general contractor, having all of the wainscoting stripped and the carved wooden moldings returned to their original state. ''Everything was painted,'' he said, even the subtly colored tiles in front of the fireplaces.</p>
        <p>Everything is returned to its original glory, with mahogany on the parlor floor, cherry on the second, and beech on the top. Mr. Antonetty has a passion, he says, for wood, which may be the source of his strong feeling for these 19th-century houses. ''To me, wood is strength,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Antonetty, who grew up in Fort Greene, and Mr. Antonetty, who grew up in a public housing project in Bushwick, moved to Bed-Stuy 15 years ago, and before buying their new house lived in one next door that they still own. ''We fell in love with brownstones,'' she said. Their new house reflects the melding of Victorian and African influences, with a new stained-glass image in their front door that is an African symbol for belief in god.</p>
        <p>They run their art business, which includes a framing shop, the gallery -- Aviva Arts, which is open by appointment only -- and a mobile gallery, where companies allow them to sell directly to the employees. They sell mostly lithographs, serigraphs and original paintings by people of African descent.</p>
        <p>NEARBY, Doreen de Leon, a native of Grenada, lives in a brownstone on Jefferson Avenue that she bought in 1984 for $60,000. She also has her own real estate company in Brooklyn, which she started shortly after retiring from her job as a bacteriologist. She also has occasional art shows on the parlor floor of her home.</p>
        <p>Ms. de Leon said she does a lot of sales and rentals in the area. Apartments that rent for about $1,000 a month, she said, would be $1,500 in Fort Greene, and they are drawing people with their fireplaces and parquet floors. ''The majority of calls are people coming from Manhattan,'' she said.</p>
        <p>For longtime homeowners, the new attractiveness of their neighborhood is both annoying and gratifying. Demetrice Mills,  who works in computer systems on Wall Street, lives with his wife and three children on Classon Avenue. He came to New York 27 years ago as a teenager on his own from North Carolina and moved into a rooming house. He fell in love with the owner's daughter; they married, and eventually bought the house from her parents. They still own that house, as well as another on Classon that they now occupy.</p>
        <p>The influx of real estate people looking for listings, he said, is grating on longtime residents. ''There's a door-to-door campaign by realtors,'' he said, started in the last year. People have even posted notices saying they will pay cash for houses.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the neighbors are quite upset with that,'' he said. ''It's like an invasion. There's the sense that white people are coming to buy our houses, that we are being pushed out of our neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>It's disturbing, he said, that family members who might want to keep a house won't be able to afford to buy it from relatives. The neighborhood has a family feeling, he said, that is most evident in barber shops, where young boys and old men and every age in between hang out, talking, even if they're not getting haircuts.</p>
        <p>He hopes, he said, that newcomers will become part of this open, friendly neighborhood, and that they will send their children to the local schools. He tries, too, to look at the economic benefits of the change that is just beginning.</p>
        <p>African-American homeowners, he said, will have property that is far more valuable than it has been, property they can leverage, through home equity loans, into cash to improve their lives, to send their children to college. And maybe, to help them buy the more-expensive homes in their old neighborhood.</p>
