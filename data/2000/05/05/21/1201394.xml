        <p>While the Knicks and the Miami Heat prepared for Game 7 today, the Indiana Pacers eagerly awaited the winner.</p>
        <p>For the third consecutive year, the Pacers have reached the Eastern Conference finals. They have confidence, they have experience, and they will have home-court advantage against either of their potential opponents. But the Pacers have a lot to prove to themselves, and to whichever team they face.</p>
        <p>The Pacers have never reached the National Basketball Association finals, and last year's conclusion was particularly disappointing.</p>
        <p>Tied at two games apiece in the Eastern conference finals against the Knicks last year, the Pacers fell apart as the Knicks won the last two games to reach the finals.</p>
        <p>It was a galling loss for the Pacers, who had allowed a shorthanded Knicks team to take over the series without Patrick Ewing.</p>
        <p>That is why the atmosphere in the Pacers' locker room Friday night was subdued as the players left quietly like businessmen leaving a board meeting.</p>
        <p>The Pacers advanced Friday at Philadelphia by ousting the 76ers, 106-90, to win their playoff series, 4-2. But the 76ers quickly became past history for the Pacers, because if the Pacers do not go any further, they will consider this season a failure.</p>
        <p>''What's to celebrate?'' said Reggie Miller, the Pacers' shooting guard and a longtime Knicks nemesis, who led the Pacers with 25 points. ''We've been here what, four, five times before? We still have work to do.''</p>
        <p>Leave it to Miller to speak his mind. Asked Friday night which team he would rather face next, he said: ''Personally, I'd rather play the Knicks, because we could exorcise some demons there. But we could also start a great new rivalry with the Heat.''</p>
        <p>Had the Heat won Friday, an Indiana-Miami series would have started today. Now, the Pacers must wait until Tuesday to play, and their players seemed unsure whether that would be to their advantage or disadvantage. The Pacers will get a few days to rest, but they could also lose their competitive rhythm. Coach Larry Bird said he could usually sense how the Pacers will respond before a game starts.</p>
        <p>''I knew we were going to play well tonight, because we had two good days of practice going into the game,'' Bird said after Friday's victory. ''I keep telling these guys that when we practice well, it carries right over into the game.''</p>
        <p>But it remained to be seen if the Pacers can finally make it to the finals. The franchise is at a crossroad. Bird has said he will not coach beyond this year. Miller is 34 years old. Rik Smits, the starting center, is 33 and has a history of foot problems.</p>
        <p>The Pacers believe their time is now. And if their core group does not get it done this time, expect key changes in the off-season.</p>
        <p>The Pacers are already a different team than last season. Antonio Davis, a longtime forward, was traded to the Toronto Raptors before the season, and Austin Croshere has assumed much of Davis's playing time. But while Croshere is a better shooter than Davis, the Pacers could miss Davis's rebounding and defense in the next series, which is sure to be rugged, no matter which team they play.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, not having Antonio is the major difference for us, but a lot of guys have stepped up and played well without him this year,'' said Jalen Rose, the Pacers' second-leading scorer, who had 21 points Friday. ''Antonio's not here, so we can't focus on that. Hopefully, we can be a better team and go farther than we have.''</p>
        <p>But while Rose has stepped forward this season to become a second reliable scoring option, the Pacers will be led by Miller, who never gets tired of playoff pressure and who loves to drive opposing fans crazy.</p>
        <p>Asked what he thought Friday when 76ers fans directed a derogatory chant toward him, Miller smiled and said, ''I thought they were saying, 'Reggie rocks.'</p>
        <p>''When you go into a hostile environment, with 20,000 people who have been all day drinking, making signs, cursing your name forward and backward, and they're coming to taunt you? To me, that's the best.</p>
        <p>''The playoffs are when I'm at my best, when I can focus on one opponent, rest my body between games, watch plenty of film on my opponent, and come out ready,'' Miller said. ''I love being a part of it.''</p>
        <p>Yet the Pacers want something more. ''I've done this before,'' Rose said of his reaction to reaching the conference finals. ''But I want to win a championship.''</p>
