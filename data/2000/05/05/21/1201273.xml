        <p>As candles burned on the makeshift altar in the Torres living room, two dozen guests each found a way to help the prayer leader, Emilia Gomez, remember Jose Torres.

        <p>As candles burned on the makeshift altar in the Torres living room, two dozen guests each found a way to help the prayer leader, Emilia Gomez, remember Jose Torres. A niece led an Ave Maria. A sister wiped away tears as she whispered inaudibly. An older neighbor concentrated deeply, the fingertips of his weathered hands held lightly together. A baby girl in a frilly pink dress made gargling sounds when she wasn't chewing quietly on her shiny black shoe.</p>
        <p>Until four months ago, this living room, at 170th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, had served a much happier purpose: it had been Jose's personal merengue and salsa studio. Friends said the Dominican immigrant danced so much in his apartment that downstairs neighbors banged on the ceiling with a broom to make him stop.</p>
        <p>''He loved being at home and barely ever went out,'' said his brother Orlando. ''He avoided the streets.'' Except, of course, when he was working. In the early morning of Jan. 12, Jose Torres became the second of nine livery cab drivers killed on the job this year. Jose was the oldest of six brothers, 36 to 50, all of whom have worked as drivers for First Class Car and Limousine Service, an Upper Manhattan livery company.</p>
        <p>As their faith required, the devoutly Catholic family held its fourth monthly hora santa on Friday, May 12. Literally translated as a ''holy hour'' but known in English as a novena, an hora santa is a gathering of friends and relatives to say a rosary every day for nine days after the death of a loved one, then every month for a year, then every year on the anniversary of the death.</p>
        <p>Emelinda Torres, Jose's sister-in-law, had prepared the altar early in the afternoon, placing a clean white sheet over the dining table and adorning it with flowers, candles, a picture of Jesus and a bowl for holy water. By 7 o'clock, all the folding chairs and plastic-covered sofas in the room were full, and Ms. Gomez, a member of the family's church who has been trained to lead novenas, began the prayers and songs. At one point, Edwina Santos, one of Jose's four children, slipped into a bedroom to change 4-week-old Desiree, the granddaughter Jose never saw.</p>
        <p>Reflection and mourning are just part of the family's emotional landscape these days. There is also fear, apprehension and frustration with the police. When the prayers ended, Emelinda passed around chicken-and-pasta salad and talk turned quickly to the safety of livery cab drivers. Orlando stopped driving for three months after his brother's death. Now that he is back on the job, his car newly equipped with a partition required by the city, he operates with much more caution.</p>
        <p>''I only pick up single passengers,'' he said. ''Two if they're Latino.''</p>
