        <p>Justice delayed may not be justice served, but Alabama prosecutors figure it is better than nothing. A grand jury indicted Thomas E. Blanton Jr. and Bobby Frank Cherry for the murder of four black girls in the 1963 bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham. Only one man, Robert Chambliss, has been tried in the case, one of the most heinous acts of the civil rights era. He was convicted in 1977. Mr. Blanton and Mr. Cherry are both former Ku Klux Klan members and have been suspects since the 1960's. Prosecutors plan to use old and newly developed evidence.</p>
