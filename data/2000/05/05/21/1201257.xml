        <p>A Landmarks Preservation Commission vote on the future of a wall sculpture was postponed Tuesday after the owner of the building involved submitted an engineers' report that the artwork could not be fully restored once some repairs were made.</p>
        <p>''The Wall,'' a 1973 sculptural relief by Forrest W. Myers, extends from the north wall of an office building at 599 Broadway, at Houston Street, in the SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District. It comprises 42 aluminum bars, six rows across and seven down, which jut from steel braces that remained when an adjacent building was razed.</p>
        <p>For nearly three years, the building's owner, the SoHo International Arts Condominium, has wanted to remove the minimalist sculpture and repair the deteriorating wall, without offering to replace the work. Its recent proposal to restore the art, which included installing an advertising billboard, was withdrawn Tuesday. The commission was scheduled to vote that day.</p>
        <p>The report said the steel braces have eroded and must be extracted to seal the wall. The artwork is attached to the braces and cannot be reattached in the same way, said David Topping of the managing agent, ABC Realty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Myers, who offered to make modifications, said at the meeting:  ''They are trying to make this sound like rocket science, but it's not. They are trying to seal a wall.''</p>
        <p>Michael T. Sillerman, lawyer for the building owner, argues that the artwork is not a protected landmark because it was installed several months after the historic district was designated. He noted that the commission had approved removal of three other wall murals in the district. But Sean Sweeney, executive director of the SoHo Alliance, said that the other works were less significant and that no one objected to their removal.</p>
        <p>Prominent artists and art institutions, including Frank Stella, Richard Serra and Robert Rauschenberg, are raising funds to save the work. Lisa Phillips, director of the New Museum for Contemporary Art, wrote the commission that its removal ''would be an irreparable loss.''</p>
        <p>'' 'The Wall' has been the gateway to SoHo for two and a half decades, and has been an important landmark in a neighborhood well known for its support of the arts,'' she wrote.</p>
