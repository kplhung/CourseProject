        <p>WEEN: 'WHITE PEPPER'  Elektra, CD, 62449-2-4.</p>
        <p>Successful transformations are rare in rock. Too often, a band's best work is its earliest, crudest and least thought-out. But Ween, a duo that has long been dismissed as little more than underground rock's cleverest pranksters, has quietly beaten the odds and turned into highly skilled and imaginative pop auteurs, with no musical limitations yet to be seen. The group's latest album, ''White Pepper,'' is its best work in a half-decade-long developmental process that has taken the band through detailed concept albums and slick sessions with Nashville professionals. (Ween will play at Irving Plaza in Manhattan on Thursday and Friday.)</p>

        <p>WEEN: 'WHITE PEPPER'  Elektra, CD, 62449-2-4.</p>
        <p>Successful transformations are rare in rock. Too often, a band's best work is its earliest, crudest and least thought-out. But Ween, a duo that has long been dismissed as little more than underground rock's cleverest pranksters, has quietly beaten the odds and turned into highly skilled and imaginative pop auteurs, with no musical limitations yet to be seen. The group's latest album, ''White Pepper,'' is its best work in a half-decade-long developmental process that has taken the band through detailed concept albums and slick sessions with Nashville professionals. (Ween will play at Irving Plaza in Manhattan on Thursday and Friday.)</p>
        <p>Unlike all previous Ween albums, ''White Pepper'' seems to be a collection of straightforward songs with no obvious parodic twist -- other than that of the album's title, an ostensible reference to cocaine. And except for a few outbreaks of comic relief, the songs address fairly grown-up subject matter. The first track, ''Exactly Where I'm At,'' is a vivid account of a singer's anxiety before an audience. Songs of love found and lost follow, as well as a few tunes whose inscrutable titles (''Back to Basom'' and ''The Grobe'') are classic Weenisms. But, tellingly, ''White Pepper'' is the first album by the twosome, Dean Ween (Mickey Melchiondo) and Gene Ween (Aaron Freeman), to contain no tape-manipulated silly voices.</p>
        <p>The band's comedic abilities, when they do appear, now seem more finely tuned. ''Bananas and Blow'' is a letter-perfect parody of Jimmy Buffett, complete with smiling steel drums and back-up singers.</p>
        <p>If Ween has a precedent, it would be Frank Zappa, whose restless creativity was inseparable from his sly and irreverent humor. Like Zappa, Ween has attained a maturity that harbors vestiges of the joker. Even in its most serious songs, ''White Pepper'' always contains a wink of irony. ''Flutes of Chi,'' with its vague beatitudes, is sweet and seductive; but what exactly are the flutes of chi?</p>
