        <p>IN Handel's day, dueling divas got into fights on stage in the middle of his operas. Cuzzioni and Faustina actually pulled the wigs off each other's heads. But Julianne Baird, who has recorded leading roles in seven Handel operas (and is working on the eighth), is a more scholarly diva.</p>
        <p>She is a tenured professor in the Fine Arts Department at the Rutgers Camden campus, has a doctorate in musicology, a full class load and scholarly papers and books to her credit. She also has a beautiful sweet soprano. ''If spring sunlight could be translated into sound, it would probably be a lot like Julianne Baird,'' David Patrick Stearns wrote in Opera News.</p>

        <p>IN Handel's day, dueling divas got into fights on stage in the middle of his operas. Cuzzioni and Faustina actually pulled the wigs off each other's heads. But Julianne Baird, who has recorded leading roles in seven Handel operas (and is working on the eighth), is a more scholarly diva.</p>
        <p>She is a tenured professor in the Fine Arts Department at the Rutgers Camden campus, has a doctorate in musicology, a full class load and scholarly papers and books to her credit. She also has a beautiful sweet soprano. ''If spring sunlight could be translated into sound, it would probably be a lot like Julianne Baird,'' David Patrick Stearns wrote in Opera News.</p>
        <p>Ms. Baird is one of America's most celebrated interpreters of early music. She has performed in 14 countries and in virtually every classical music series in the United States. She has appeared with major symphonies, like the New York Philharmonic, the Cleveland Orchestra and the San Francisco Symphony, under such conductors as Zubin Mehta, Christopher Hogwood and Trevor Pinnock. She has recorded over 90 CD's, making her one of the most recorded singers in classical music. When school is out this summer, Ms. Baird will have concerts in Leipzig and London. In New York, she will be recording the title role in Handel's rarely performed last opera, ''Deidamea.''</p>
        <p>Deidamea falls in love with Achilles, who is hiding on her island to avoid service in the Trojan War. She dresses him in women's clothes, but later Achilles gets angry and accuses her of being fickle, the blonde-blue eyed, Ms. Baird explained with a grin after a rehearsal in Manhattan. ''The opera has six arias,'' she said, ''including a 'you've abandoned me, how could you' sort of an aria, and a bird song where the singer gets to show off her trills and high notes.'' And Ms. Baird's are famous.</p>
        <p>Laura Ulrich, a Rutgers voice student, said of meeting the diva: ''It was this feeling like, 'Oh my God everyone knows her, and she's right here. Her room is right across the hallway.' And then you meet her, and she has no air about her at all like, 'I'm better than you.' She makes you feel like teaching students is her life, and that the other stuff she does is just on the side.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Baird says she likes her day job just as much as ''the other stuff.''</p>
        <p>''I feel as excited coming out of class as out of a recital,'' Ms. Baird said. ''Teaching a lecture class is every bit like doing a concert if the presentation goes as you planned.''</p>
        <p>This year Ms. Baird's teaching responsibilities included an introductory music course, an opera history course, master vocal classes and a madrigal ensemble. She has also provided some perks. She got free opera tickets for the students in her opera history class from her opera colleagues. Her friends at the Waverly Consort, an early music group, donated a 17th-century opera set to the Fine Arts Department that is perfect for madrigal performances.</p>
        <p>Last fall, Ms. Baird organized a madrigal festival at Rutgers for high school students. Last June, she organized a Kosovo Relief Fund Concert and invited members of the Philadelphia Orchestra to perform in the concert, which was held in Haddonfield, where Ms. Baird lives with her family.</p>
        <p>How does she do it all?</p>
        <p>Classes do not usually conflict with performances, which are usually on weekends, she said. She does not take a lunch hour at Rutgers. She studies her music on trains on the way to rehearsals. Sometimes she overdubs recordings. ''When school is out and I have less stress, I will simply come into the studio and sing my parts over an orchestral recording,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Then there are the tricks for preserving her voice in class. ''When I teach a big class, I pull in my diaphragm to project in front of a big class,'' she said. ''I also move my chair as close to the students as I can, and I speak in a higher range. I find it carries further.''</p>
        <p>Yet even when she has a big concert coming up, Ms. Baird may not tell her students. ''I don't necessarily tell my students that I'm going off to sing at Lincoln Center,'' she said. ''I know what it was like when my professors handed me their reviews. These students still need someone who is there for them.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Baird, a native of Statesville, N.C., received her bachelor's and master's degrees from the Eastman School of Music and a Ph.D. in musicology from Stanford University and studied at the Mozarteum in Salzburg. But her career development was rocky at first. ''In college, I was a singer with a too-small voice to do what they thought I should to fit in. So I found a place where I could go -- Baroque music. In other words, I applied what was a weakness into a strength. For Baroque singing you want it delicate and light and agile, not loud and wobbly and vibrato-y.'' It's the weaknesses in life one has to prepare for, she tells her students.</p>
        <p>She teaches them lots of things, said Ms. Ulrich who was in the madrigal ensemble and is graduating this year. ''She puts her experience and her vocal education into teaching. When we gave our madrigal concert at the end of the year, she made it possible for everyone to have their own little solos. I think the concert was fabulous. It was sad to say goodbye.''</p>
