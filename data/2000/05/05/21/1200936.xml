        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>DREAMBIRDS: The Strange History of the Ostrich in Fashion, Food, and Fortune, by Rob Nixon. (Picador USA, $23.) Camouflaged as natural history, ode to gawky beauty and social study of precarious empires built on feathers, this book is at bottom a haunting memoir of a South African boyhood.</p>
        <p>THE FEAST OF LOVE, by Charles Baxter. (Pantheon, $24.) A luminous he-said-she-said of a novel, in which He, a handsome toadlike man, and She, Ex-Wife No. 1, unspool contrary narratives of their life together.</p>
        <p>THE HUMAN STAIN, by Philip Roth. (Houghton Mifflin, $26.) The novel's doomed protagonist is a modern converso: a black man passing as a Jew so he'll be taken for white; our old friend Nathan Zuckerman tells his story.</p>
        <p>HUNTS IN DREAMS, by Tom Drury. (Houghton Mifflin, $22.) A sequel to ''The End of Vandalism'' set in the same bleak farm community, this novel centers on the ex-vandal, now a plumber (gone straight more from detachment than maturity), as he confronts the breakup of his marriage.</p>
        <p>JOHN RUSKIN: The Later Years, by Tim Hilton. (Yale University, $35.) Opening when its subject is 40 and a rising authority on aesthetics, Volume 2 of this vast biography charts Ruskin's unraveling from passionate cataloger (rocks, plants, buildings, paintings, clouds) to tragic obsessive (irrigation, drainage, running water, little girls).</p>
        <p>THE MAN WHO WROTE THE BOOK, by Erik Tarloff. (Crown, $23.) Dead-ended at a jerkwater college, the scholar hero of this riotous novel strikes pseudonymous pay dirt as a pornographer: his magnum opus, ''Every Inch a Lady,'' out-Potters Potter and draws a glowing notice -- by Updike yet -- in the very pages you are holding.</p>
        <p>THE MANY ASPECTS OF MOBILE HOME LIVING, by Martin Clark. (Knopf, $24.) This first novel by a Southern judge features . . . a Southern judge, who logs overtime as cuckold, bribe taker, treasure hunter and devoted tester of controlled substances but by the end has become a guy worth knowing. (Caveat: Contains one scene in which a certain discomfort befalls two small kitties.)</p>
        <p>MEN IN THE OFF HOURS, by Anne Carson. (Knopf, $24.) There is a startling freshness deep down these poems, the work of a writer for whom the ever-sharp world exerts attractive and repulsive forces in equal measure.</p>
        <p>NEWJACK: Guarding Sing Sing, by Ted Conover. (Random House, $24.95.) A journalist's account of his year as a correction officer, where his moral well-being was as much at risk as his bodily safety.</p>
        <p>SIX FIGURES, by Fred G. Leebron. (Knopf, $22.) The yuppie couple in this novel, no strangers to anger, covetousness and envy, now confront great violence -- and the suspicion that it is home-grown.</p>

        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>DREAMBIRDS: The Strange History of the Ostrich in Fashion, Food, and Fortune, by Rob Nixon. (Picador USA, $23.) Camouflaged as natural history, ode to gawky beauty and social study of precarious empires built on feathers, this book is at bottom a haunting memoir of a South African boyhood.</p>
        <p>THE FEAST OF LOVE, by Charles Baxter. (Pantheon, $24.) A luminous he-said-she-said of a novel, in which He, a handsome toadlike man, and She, Ex-Wife No. 1, unspool contrary narratives of their life together.</p>
        <p>THE HUMAN STAIN, by Philip Roth. (Houghton Mifflin, $26.) The novel's doomed protagonist is a modern converso: a black man passing as a Jew so he'll be taken for white; our old friend Nathan Zuckerman tells his story.</p>
        <p>HUNTS IN DREAMS, by Tom Drury. (Houghton Mifflin, $22.) A sequel to ''The End of Vandalism'' set in the same bleak farm community, this novel centers on the ex-vandal, now a plumber (gone straight more from detachment than maturity), as he confronts the breakup of his marriage.</p>
        <p>JOHN RUSKIN: The Later Years, by Tim Hilton. (Yale University, $35.) Opening when its subject is 40 and a rising authority on aesthetics, Volume 2 of this vast biography charts Ruskin's unraveling from passionate cataloger (rocks, plants, buildings, paintings, clouds) to tragic obsessive (irrigation, drainage, running water, little girls).</p>
        <p>THE MAN WHO WROTE THE BOOK, by Erik Tarloff. (Crown, $23.) Dead-ended at a jerkwater college, the scholar hero of this riotous novel strikes pseudonymous pay dirt as a pornographer: his magnum opus, ''Every Inch a Lady,'' out-Potters Potter and draws a glowing notice -- by Updike yet -- in the very pages you are holding.</p>
        <p>THE MANY ASPECTS OF MOBILE HOME LIVING, by Martin Clark. (Knopf, $24.) This first novel by a Southern judge features . . . a Southern judge, who logs overtime as cuckold, bribe taker, treasure hunter and devoted tester of controlled substances but by the end has become a guy worth knowing. (Caveat: Contains one scene in which a certain discomfort befalls two small kitties.)</p>
        <p>MEN IN THE OFF HOURS, by Anne Carson. (Knopf, $24.) There is a startling freshness deep down these poems, the work of a writer for whom the ever-sharp world exerts attractive and repulsive forces in equal measure.</p>
        <p>NEWJACK: Guarding Sing Sing, by Ted Conover. (Random House, $24.95.) A journalist's account of his year as a correction officer, where his moral well-being was as much at risk as his bodily safety.</p>
        <p>SIX FIGURES, by Fred G. Leebron. (Knopf, $22.) The yuppie couple in this novel, no strangers to anger, covetousness and envy, now confront great violence -- and the suspicion that it is home-grown.</p>
