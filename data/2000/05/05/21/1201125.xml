      <block class="full_text">
        <p>SO much light!''</p>
        <p>With wonder, 15-year-old Grace Farley describes the radiance of her surroundings in the factory where she went to work at such an early age because ''Poppa said, 'School's a waste' '' and Momma was just horrid.</p>
        <p>But the factory in Orange was not dark and dingy and dirty, as expected. Oddly enough, it gave its girls the chance to be girls, to make their own playtime.</p>
        <p>This they did with the paint they were supposed to be using in their work. When they weren't applying it, as told, to watches and to clocks that would glow in the dark, (all the rage in 1926) they were putting that iridescent paint, the precursor to Day-Glo -- on their teeth to make their smiles shimmer. Just for fun.</p>
        <p>Of course, the girls were duly scolded for turning work time into playtime, but work and play didn't turn out to be all that different. Both were hazardous to their health in much the same ways.</p>
        <p>To do an exacting, precise job, they were expected to use wet paint. That's how you get the finest brushstroke. And what more natural way to moisten the paintbrush than by putting it to your lips?</p>
        <p>While the spirit-crushing labors of many losers drive them to lead hand-to-mouth existences, the losing labors of these ingenuous, life-loving teenagers were literally done mouth to hand. Profits were up, so their labors were not lost. But lives were. It all starts with a slowly decaying jawbone.</p>
        <p>Once you see ''Radium Girls,'' Dolores Whiskeyman's distilled account of a complicated, true chapter of shame in New Jersey's history books, at Playwrights Theater here, you are not likely to look at a timepiece that lights up in the same way again. You will think of the derivations and forms of words, and their implications. Like radiance and radiation. And radium.</p>
        <p>And you will surely reflect upon the ways opposites connect, overlap, interchange.</p>
        <p>Even if you weren't up on the scientific breakthroughs of the iconic Madame Marie Sklodowska Curie, if you were a child of the 40's or of M.G.M. movies, you grew up knowing that Madame Curie was good, if only because Greer Garson played good women. After all, there was a Madame Curie Radium Club.</p>
        <p>Imagine the jolt when the ailing Dr. Marie Curie, ''the high priestess of science,'' protests, feebly, when a reporter asks her, ''Is radium a cure for all cancer?''</p>
        <p>And why is she in drag? Is this an artistic choice, a Gertrude Stein send-up or a budgetary constraint in a multiply cast play, with nine actors taking on more than 30 roles? Allowing for some confusion, some of it amusing, Joseph Megel's graceful staging is a case example of the craft of putting it together.</p>
        <p>No question, even in Ms. Whiskeyman's gripping, level-headed morality play, bad is bad. Consciously exploitative employers are bad, an extortionist dentist is bad, the company lawyer's maneuverings are heartless blows to humanity, a Nurse Ratched-type supervisor is irredeemably, loathsomely ludicrous. And reporters are reporters.</p>
        <p>''How does it feel, knowing you have so little time left?'' a reporter asks one of the young afflicted girls, who, it is pointed out, bears her cross in life so nobly.</p>
        <p>But the president of the U.S. Radium Corporation plant in Orange is a tormented man, no stock villain. And the playwright suggests the flip side of cause-consciousness, as perceived in the subtle motives of the executive director of the New Jersey Consumer's League. These are the play's most complex characters, enhanced by Daren Kelly and Elizabeth Baron's knowing performances.</p>
        <p>In trying to encompass a dense story, rife with thematic richness and far-reaching implications, while interweaving conflicts involving family, friends and lovers, Ms. Whiskeyman resorts to tired narrative devices, not thoroughly bypassing the cliches of docudrama, but her play is more imperfect than unwieldy.</p>
        <p>Too bad promising is such an overused, disagreeably well meaning but meaningless and patronizing word for a playwright with a talent to enlighten and provoke, not to mention a researcher of infinite patience and purpose. Ms. Whiskeyman is beyond the ''promising playwright'' appellation, but her work gives credibility to a process-oriented theater.</p>
        <p>Before last Saturday's matinee, executive director John Pietrowski talked about giving the play a ''final sendoff,'' assured that ''everything is working the way we and the author intended.''</p>
        <p>To validate the developmental phases that define the work of Playwrights Theater, a play must, in its last phase, prove a determined readiness to move on. ''Radium Girls'' is ready.</p>
        <p>RADIUM GIRLS  Playwrights Theater of New Jersey, 33 Green Village Road, Madison.</p>
        <p>Through May 28. Today and next Sunday at 3 p.m.; Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m.; Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m.  (973) 514-1787.</p>
