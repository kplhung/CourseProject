        <p>WHEN I WAS MORTAL</p>
        <p>By Javier Marias.</p>
        <p>New Directions, $21.95.</p>
        <p>The murder rate in Javier Marias's world is exceptionally high. The killers in this Spanish author's stylish, cerebral short stories are not the usual suspects, but respectable Europeans -- doctors, vacationers, at-home wives -- pursuing desire and resentment to their logical ends. In the first story, a woman in a loveless marriage can't disguise ''the irritation we always feel towards those who are superfluous to us'' and helps do away with the source of her misery. Another despairing soul rises up against his psychic oppressor in ''Broken Binoculars,'' the glum confession of a bodyguard who's about to kill the wealthy man he's paid to protect. These 12 stories are throwbacks: two are about ghosts; one is a classic whodunit; and nearly all are narrated by reserved, innocuous minor characters straight out of 19th-century British literature. In ''In Uncertain Time,'' for example, we learn that the wife of a soccer star is ''one of those women who attracts the attention of her husband or fiance by tugging at his sleeve with two fingers or by slipping her hand into his overcoat pocket, I couldn't explain it any other way, nor should I.'' Marias is a startling talent: in this smart translation by Margaret Jull Costa, his prose is ambitious, ironic, philosophical and ultimately compassionate, forgiving of the vulnerability that compels us to destroy. When that seemingly invincible soccer star is shot in the chest, the narrator muses on ''two feeble fingers that have grown tired of slipping into a pocket or tugging at a sleeve, tired of being beneath the sole of a boot.''</p>
