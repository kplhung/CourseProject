        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article misses the crucial issue: those of recently mixed race or heritage are not the only ones who face challenges. Many more people are affected by the question of place in a race-conscious society.</p>
        <p>I am an American of African and other descent, as is my husband. But  while this heritage has left its stamp on the features and complexions of all of us, the other is so distant (three generations or more) as to not be considered relevant, at least in American society today.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article misses the crucial issue: those of recently mixed race or heritage are not the only ones who face challenges. Many more people are affected by the question of place in a race-conscious society.</p>
        <p>I am an American of African and other descent, as is my husband. But  while this heritage has left its stamp on the features and complexions of all of us, the other is so distant (three generations or more) as to not be considered relevant, at least in American society today.</p>
        <p>None of us, including our mothers and my husband's siblings, are products of interracial unions, at least not in recent generations. Yet all of us have had the experience of having it assumed that we are not African-American. On any given day on the subway (or in a bodega or on the street) people will come up to me and fire away in Spanish or ask  straight out: Are you Spanish? Dominican? Latina? My mother relates similar experiences, with similar frequency.</p>
        <p>The broader issue is the browning of society and the corresponding adjustment society must make to reject defining people according to race- and ethnic-based classification.</p>
