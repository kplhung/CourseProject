      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>After reading the outraged responses (Letters, April 23) to Andrew Sullivan's article on testosterone (April 2), I finally got around to reading his article myself. Did I miss something? It was, in my opinion, a thoughtful, modulated treatise. It would seem that most of Sullivan's hypotheses were backed by clinical research or personal experience (or both), rather than racist or sexist supposition.</p>
        <p>I was bewildered by the vehemence and personal nature of some of the responses in your letters column. I implore these readers to take another look; perhaps their hackles will be smoothed a bit by a second, more objective examination of the material presented.</p>
