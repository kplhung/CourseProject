        <p>The emaciated body of a child in a roach-infested apartment. An empty refrigerator. A long history of complaints to the city's child protective services.</p>
        <p>As these facts emerged last week from the death of Ahsianea Carzan, a 5-year-old girl in the Bronx, they evoked some of the city's most notorious child abuse cases -- cases of children like Elisa Izquierdo and ''Marisol,'' whose maltreatment spurred an overhaul of the child welfare system about the time that Ahsianea was born.</p>
        <p>But a much more complicated picture began to develop within hours after Ahsianea died, her birdlike frame swathed in a diaper.</p>
        <p>The child had been severely affected by cerebral palsy, it seemed. Doctors had examined her six months before her death but did not consider  her stunted size evidence of neglect. The family's history of abuse complaints and investigations by the child welfare agency was tangled in  the estranged parents' bitter custody dispute and the father's record of arrests for domestic violence.</p>
        <p>Despite initial talk of charging the child's 24-year-old mother, Ebony Carzan, with murder, the police released her after questioning, still uncertain whether they would seek criminal charges.</p>
        <p>Public attention quickly fades in uncertain cases like this one. Yet its complexities may better reflect the vast, murky universe of family problems faced by the city's Administration for Children's Services than the cases that capture public outrage, like the 1995 beating death of Elisa Izquierdo or the near-starvation of the lead plaintiff in Marisol v. Giuliani, a class-action lawsuit filed against the system the same year. The real name of the child known as Marisol was withheld under the terms of the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>In 1999, by the city's count, 57 abused and neglected children died, 23 from families previously identified in reports of suspected maltreatment to the city agency. Nicholas Scoppetta, the agency's commissioner, said those 23 cases represented  the lowest number on record, a reversal of a three-year rise -- to 36 in 1998 from 24 in 1996 -- that some critics linked to caseworker and agency mistakes.</p>
        <p>But the commissioner was reluctant to trumpet the decline. ''This is a very small number in a huge universe of cases -- 175,000 children in the city of New York have been the subjects of a child protective investigation,'' he said. ''It's very hard to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of a child welfare system if you just look at a handful of cases.''</p>
        <p>Even among the children whose deaths are examined by the state, relatively few are homicide cases; many reflect failures of prevention, like the child who died after an asthma attack in a home where the foster mother had not been prepared to handle his medical needs.</p>
        <p>However the uncertainties of Ahsianea's case are resolved, she is more typical of thousands of needy children in the agency's purview who are at risk not because their parents are bad but because they are overwhelmed. A panel of national experts concluded in a recent report that one  problem in the city's child welfare agency is its failure to mobilize its preventive services programs to help such families cope with their burdens and to stand ready to step in if assistance does not work.</p>
        <p>In the Carzan family, officials said, the mother was referred to an agency under contract with the city for counseling, housing assistance and support with her child's medical needs. It is unclear what services she actually received, but in August 1999, after about nine months, the city closed the case.</p>
        <p>At the time, the young single mother, herself an orphan and a victim of domestic violence, was moving to the Bronx, the fourth borough she had lived in within five years. She had four children, including a baby and Ahsianea, whose food she said she pureed and fed to her in a baby bottle because of the girl's condition.</p>
        <p>''It's a family that's going to need continued support,'' Edith Holtzer, a spokeswoman for the Council of Family and Child Caring Agencies, said Friday. ''Preventive services, it's not a quick fix.''</p>
        <p>For the poorest families of medically fragile children, said Arlene Goldsmith, who directs New Alternatives for Children, the needs for preventive services are enormous. The families may need help finding sophisticated medical care, advocates who can wrestle with the city bureaucracy, and support groups for siblings of the disabled child.</p>
        <p>''You want to buy one of these siblings a pair of sneakers, it's $75; that takes care of your entire food budget,'' Ms. Goldsmith said. ''And a lot of our parents, it's just impossible for them to work -- the kids have nine appointments a week.''</p>
        <p>Such complex cases underline the limits, and even the dangers, of letting highly publicized abuse cases drive policy, many child welfare experts say.</p>
        <p>Some critics even contend that the city's three-year spike in child fatalities, and last year's drop, are part of a predictable pattern in the aftermath of cases like Elisa Izquierdo's: a get-tough policy of removing children from homes that floods the foster care system and then subsides until the next public outcry.</p>
        <p>The panel of experts, which examined the agency in the settlement of the Marisol lawsuit, said the city's preventive services were disconnected from its protection efforts.</p>
        <p>''Unlike the practice in virtually every other jurisdiction we know of,'' the panel wrote, ''there has been no continuing protective involvement in New York City when higher-risk cases receive preventive services from a contract agency.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Scoppetta said a new blueprint for neighborhood-based child welfare services would improve the timely attention to family needs.  ''Knowing that we can't prevent every tragedy,'' he said, ''doesn't prevent us from feeling as though we can.''</p>
