        <p>THE pilot for the first television sitcom set in the Hamptons will be filmed in the Hamptons this summer. Not just the opening beach shots, but the whole yarn about an 18-year-old high-tech surfer babe living in the barn on the potato farm she inherited from her uncle.</p>
        <p>''Mande Dahl,'' named for the teenage action heroine who will be its star, will be the first show filmed at the LTV Media Center soundstage, a new state-of-the art studio next door to the studios of LTV, East Hampton's public access station (Channel 70), in the pine forest by the East Hampton Airport.</p>
        <p>''It's a terrific space to make a show,'' said Amanda Hunter, 48, of Sagaponack, the sitcom's creator, executive producer and  co-writer with her husband, Jeff Hunter. ''Mande Dahl is all about the Hamptons. It's a great opportunity. The soundstage is such a wonderful asset to the community.''</p>
        <p>Actors, writers and film directors have long summered and kept second homes on the East End. But until now, if they wanted produce a show, they had to head back west.</p>
        <p>''This will be a blessing for a lot of filmmakers to do some shooting closer to home,'' said Ms. Hunter, who is planning to do the pilot and the first 13 episodes before a live audience of 250 to 300 people. While the  initial casting was done in Manhattan, auditions for some secondary roles are being held out east. And Ms. Hunter is sure the production location will make her actors and actresses happy campers. Open casting will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the studio and she is also looking for local people to work behind the scenes.</p>
        <p>''I think they'll be thrilled to come out here and shoot in the summer,'' she said. ''I  can think of a lot worse things than that.''</p>
        <p>The newly completed film and video production center, housed in a white metal building next to the public access building, has 50-foot ceilings and looks like an airplane hangar. But it has two star dressing rooms, double-layered walls to buffer outside noise, a film room and office space, as well as wiring for telecommunications, video and fiber optics, said Frazer Dougherty, 77, the president of the Media Center and acting president of LTV. A separate scenery shop was also just completed.</p>
        <p>''I visualize this as a needs media center, a real state-of-the-art media center,'' Mr. Dougherty said.</p>
        <p>If all goes according to Mr. Dougherty's plan, ''Mande Dahl'' will be the first in a long line of productions to come out of the East Hampton facility that he would like to be known as Pinewood West, a reference to the British film studio.</p>
        <p>But he bristles at a reference to the new complex as ''Hollywood East.'' ''I don't think the big boys like Spielberg want to think Hollywood is in their backyard,'' said Mr. Dougherty, a former industrial designer and World War II aviator who has been involved with LTV since it went on the air 24 hours a day 14 years ago. ''We think of this as a classy place. Hollywood we think of as not so classy.''</p>
        <p>No big names have signed on for the soundstage yet. Ms. Hunter, an unknown, hopes her show, produced by L. A. Hardeman Productions, will be picked up by a network.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dougherty said he is in negotiation with the actor Alec Baldwin -- who was host at the soundstage ribbon-cutting on May 1 -- has expressed interest in using the studio to film the movie ''The Devil and Daniel Webster.'' John Corso, a cinematographer and film producer from Manhattan with credits on ''Fatal Attraction'' and ''First Wives Club,'' has spoken to Mr. Dougherty about a $50 million project, ''Lone Eagle,'' based on the Tuskegee Airmen, a black fighter squadron that trained in Alabama during World War II. And Mr. Dougherty has put out feelers to Steven Spielberg, who owns a home in East Hampton. So far there has been no response.</p>
        <p>''We have always lived in the big tent so we could rent out portions of the big tent out to others,'' Mr. Dougherty said, noting that LTV has a $300,000 budget but only receives $100,000 for the public access franchise. WVVH, a low-powered commercial station, shares Studio 1 with public access. Studios 3 and 4 in the public access building belong to the Media Center and are rented out for play readings, debates, local school productions, commercial film ventures and as party space for East End benefits.</p>
        <p>''Every year we would go out on our knees with a tin cup,'' Mr. Dougherty said. ''To solve the problem, a soundstage seemed to be a way to go.'' It will rent for $3,000 a day, plus electricity.</p>
        <p>The idea for the soundstage was born five years ago when Mr. Dougherty learned that a tent company was looking to build on the adjoining town-owned property. Worried that the public access channel would lose any likelihood of eventually expanding, and with a possible film in the works, he promised to build the filmmakers a soundstage. That film was never made.</p>
        <p>''We may have a lion by its tail and we may have a white elephant,'' Mr. Dougherty said.</p>
