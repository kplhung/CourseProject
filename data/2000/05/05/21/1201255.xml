        <p>When Yuni Rodman and her husband, Akiva Yaglom, come to New York, one of their first stops is Black Sea, a Russian bookstore on Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''My husband is a book addict,'' said Ms. Rodman, a literary translator who lives in Boston. ''Coming here is a tradition.''</p>
        <p>The tradition began eight years ago, when the couple immigrated to America from Moscow, leaving behind most of their 4,000-volume home library. Since then, shopping at Black Sea, the oldest bookstore in Brighton Beach, has become a way for them to build up a new library, and they appreciate the store's low prices and large selection.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rodman and Mr. Yaglom are two of many immigrants from the former Soviet Union who flocked to Brighton Beach from places as far away as San Francisco and Australia seeking to reconnect with Russian culture. Many New Yorkers regard Brighton Beach as a place to sample potato pirozhkis or drink vodka in an authentic Russian restaurant, but the area has also become a Russian-language book district.</p>
        <p>Along a 15-block stretch of Brighton Beach Avenue, there are six bookstores, a dozen street book vendors and hundreds of thousands of books. The Black Sea bookstore has been around for 20 years. Others, relative newcomers, have sprung up in the last decade.</p>
        <p>''Brighton Beach is the Russian bazaar of America,'' said Alexander Genis, a writer who immigrated to the United States 21 years ago.</p>
        <p>Books have become an essential part of the mix, and local stores offer most of the works that are published in Russia, from classics to thrillers, health to philosophy, art to romance.</p>
        <p>''Books are three times cheaper here than anywhere else,'' said Sergey Kantsevoy, a doctor from Baltimore who was shopping for books the other day at St. Petersburg Books-Music-Video, which has two outposts in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Dmitry Shelchkov, a doctor from Hartford, added: ''Basically, you buy books by the basketful. A basket is $50.'' His basket included a dozen books for his 3-year-old nephew and  videotapes of Russian operas.</p>
        <p>St. Petersburg Books-Music-Video, which its owner, Joseph Berov, describes as the largest Russian-language bookstore outside Russia, carries more than 10,000 book titles on its 6,000-square-foot space along with 3,000 videotapes and 5,000 CD's.</p>
        <p>It has 50 employees. Typical prices include $2 for a hardcover edition of Vladimir Nabokov's essays; $3.95 for a hardcover translation of Ernest Hemingway's ''For Whom the Bell Tolls''; and $3.99 for a two-volume hardcover edition of George Orwell's novels and essays.</p>
        <p>''The competition is tough,'' said Konstantin Mekler, the owner of White Nights, a small family-owned bookstore across the street from St. Petersburg.</p>
        <p>''But you won't find a more Russian place in America. So each of us has enough customers to survive.''</p>
