        <p>''The French people really love music, and will have it,'' Fanny Trollope wrote in 1835. What they loved best was opera, not the grand variety (too heavy, too long) but the feel-good tunes of Rossini, Meyerbeer and Offenbach. While Paris rang with them, serious operatic and orchestral music was pinned in an institutional and academic grip that ensured that for a century after the death of Rameau in 1764 France marked time while Italy and Germany produced composers to be measured in cubits and spans. Paris, cutting, amending, improving, adapted Weber and Mozart for the French taste and corrected Beethoven's discords to provide a more ''pleasing'' effect. While French writers took the world by storm, French music proceeded largo rallentando.</p>
        <p>The only head to appear above the parapet belonged to Hector Berlioz (1803-69). But such a head! The brow of Jove, brooding eyes, a beak for a nose and very big hair. Cartoonists drew him as an open umbrella on a hat stand, and satirists mocked his booming music, which, if loaded into a tuba and pointed at cows, might yet serve a useful purpose as a humane sonic stun gun for the capital's slaughterhouses. If Berlioz composed by lightning flash, he also captured the thunder that went with it. He could work on a smaller scale, as in the ''Melodies'' or the ''Nuits d'ete,'' but his music was of a size to match his towering vision. The ''Te Deum,'' for instance, called for an orchestra of 150 plus organ, a double chorus of 200 and the voices of 600 children. Berlioz built vast, reverberating halls of sound on foundations that did not include, critics said, the ''principles of sound composition.'' Quite. His principles were new: innovative rhythms and instrumentation, expressive harmonies and a sense of space that created the ''lean and lucid sound'' that makes him, for David Cairns, ''the greatest French composer between Rameau and Debussy.'' It is a claim brilliantly sustained in Cairns's biography.</p>
        <p>Berlioz was born near Grenoble beneath the romantic Alps but in a musical desert. A dashing uncle filled his head with Napoleon, and the writing of Chateaubriand acquainted him with the sense of being alone in a world opposed to idealism, which never left him. His father, a doctor, intended him for a medical career and personally supervised his education. He also learned the flute and the guitar but not the piano, a circumstance that, Cairns observes, helps explain why he wrote in orchestral rather than harmonic terms and why his music, linear in character, would sound so oddly different to audiences accustomed to compositions based on piano timbres.</p>
        <p>In 1821, leaving behind his first unrequited romantic love, he went to Paris to study medicine, and only then did he hear an orchestra and glimpse what real music might be. He lasted a year as a student before finding Glck and his vocation: composition. His father was horrified but agreed to support him, in the hope that he would come to his senses. He never did -- it was the last thing he wanted -- and the elder Berlioz never really forgave him.</p>
        <p>Soon he had a teacher and his first gods. Against the fashion for Italian music, he defended the French tradition of Glck and Spontini, and quickly added Weber to his list of immortals. In 1827, he discovered the genius of Shakespeare in a short season played by a company of English actors, and the following year he wept on first hearing the undreamed-of dimensions of Beethoven. Deaf to Bach and cool to Mozart, who had been annexed by the Italian lobby, he resolved to ''paint the passions'' in grand, dramatic, spiritual music that would remain within the discipline of the French neoclassic style.</p>
        <p>By 1830 he had completed a quantity of orchestral and operatic work and heard his own music in performance, in a commissioned Mass and then, in 1828, in the first of the many concerts he would organize. Some of these early works he later disowned, but others, like the ''Eight Scenes From Faust'' (1829), would be incorporated into later and greater scores. But he had also been given his first taste of establishment opposition. Already regarded as a fevered maverick, he was denied the prestigious Prix de Rome on technicalities three times before winning it in 1830. By then, he had found his second love, the lustrous but unapproachable Harriet Smithson, who had dissolved his heart as Ophelia in 1827, and the third, Camille Moke, who told him on good authority that Smithson was no better than she should be. Camille's mother refused permission to marry until Berlioz had an opera in production: the ''Tempest'' overture and the ''Symphonie Fantastique'' (1830) were not enough. At this crucial time, Berlioz left Paris and Camille for Rome, where his prize bursary would be paid. Italy brought multiple disappointments: the music there was dull, and in his absence Camille married the rich piano manufacturer Pleyel. Berlioz was devastated but survived the crisis. When he returned to Paris in 1832, fate in smiling mood reunited him with the wondrous and now vindicated Smithson. They married in 1833.</p>
        <p>Cairns's first volume, published in 1989 in London, ends here, on an optimistic note, with the artist fully formed and Ophelia in his arms. The second -- both are now published together in the United States -- offers a somber chronicle of relentless struggle and the dispersion of genius. While Rossini and Meyerbeer lived handsomely on their royalties, Berlioz found the door of the Paris Opera permanently shut. In 1843, by a signal act of institutional spite, the hall of the Conservatoire, the most regular outlet for his music, was closed to him, and most of his major works waited years to be heard. Paganini and Liszt endorsed him publicly, he electrified Wagner, and musicians who played in his concerts gave their services free. He offered audiences grandeur and melody but no tunes. The establishment accused him of corrupting taste. A permanent outsider, he never acquired a tenured teaching or conducting position and for 30 years paid his way as a music critic, and by ''alimentary'' labor, which made him more enemies and sapped his creative energies.</p>
        <p>In 1842, he embarked on the first of many foreign tours. In Germany, Russia, Hungary and England he was at last given the recognition denied him at home: in London in 1847, his ''tuneless'' music flared wondrously, ''like a match with a train of powder.'' He still had his sights on Paris, where his overtures and ''dramatic symphonies'' were more popular than his opera ''Benvenuto Cellini'' (1838) or the opera de concert ''The Damnation of Faust'' (1846). By 1848, the year of revolutions in Europe, the social Romantic had become suspicious of what egalitarianism would do to music. But his spiritual yearnings were undimmed, and in the 1850's he found inspiration increasingly in the past and began to bring music, the Germans said, close to the condition of poetry.</p>
        <p>His tours exhausted him, an intestinal disorder left him in constant pain and he was surrounded by death. Harriet, from whom he had separated, disintegrated slowly and unhappily. His second wife, Marie Recio, was struck down by a heart attack, and two sisters, like his wayward son, all died before he did.</p>
        <p>But there were compensations. Though Paris never took to him wholeheartedly, ''L'Enfance du Christ'' (1854) was well received, and in 1863 his opera ''Les Troyens,'' truncated for reasons of cost, made him financially independent. Abroad, he was recognized as one of the great conductors of the age, and by 1859 he was regarded, with Wagner and Liszt, as a leader of the New German School. These were comforts, and his personal resilience survives in his journalism, where he was always fair-minded, in his ''Memoires'' (1870), which relate his struggles with good humor, and in stories full of quirky observation: the cellist who had not washed his face since the day Rossini kissed him, or the dancer who could not possibly perform in the key of E flat.</p>
        <p>But it was for all that a tragic life, and Cairns, for many years the chief music critic of The Sunday Times in London, tells the story with sober elegance and uncommon sympathy. He is a marvelous guide to the musical life and aesthetic arguments of 19th-century Europe and shows Berlioz as a man of his times. But he also brings Berlioz close to us. He shares his enthusiasm for the music and makes it luminously accessible to nonmusicians. Berlioz once observed wryly that the luck of having talent was not enough without ''a talent for luck.'' His luck has changed. His music is now played as he intended it to be heard, and in Cairns he has found one of the great musical biographers.</p>
