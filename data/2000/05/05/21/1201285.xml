        <p>IT was the most spontaneous -- and unexpected -- moment at last week's annual ''up fronts,'' a four-day rite in which network television executives nervously announce their new sitcoms and dramas to advertisers in New York and bring in the casts of current hit shows to meet them.

        <p>Whatever the flaws of the Aaron Sorkin dramatic series about a fictional liberal president and his White House staff, the audience was saying, in effect, that a grown-up and unpatronizing show was a source of rare pride to them. The show is successful, too.</p>

        <p>IT was the most spontaneous -- and unexpected -- moment at last week's annual ''up fronts,'' a four-day rite in which network television executives nervously announce their new sitcoms and dramas to advertisers in New York and bring in the casts of current hit shows to meet them. As Scott Sassa, president of NBC West Coast, and Garth Ancier, NBC's president of entertainment, introduced the stars of ''West Wing,'' the audience at Lincoln Center stood for a prolonged standing ovation, startling both executives and actors.</p>
        <p>Whatever the flaws of the Aaron Sorkin dramatic series about a fictional liberal president and his White House staff, the audience was saying, in effect, that a grown-up and unpatronizing show was a source of rare pride to them. The show is successful, too.</p>
        <p>But then there was the rest -- old and new -- that the public will see this fall. And the refrain heard among  media buyers, talent agents and managers, and television executives at the elaborate parties around the city was: Is this really the best that network television can offer?</p>
        <p>The new shows include appealing comedy series with movie stars like Bette Midler and Geena Davis. Others are simply replicas: The NBC show ''Tucker,'' about a bright boy living with mother, seems similar to the Fox hit ''Malcolm in the Middle.'' The CBS series ''The Fugitive'' mirrors the Harrison Ford film and the 1960's David Janssen prototype. The NBC series ''DAG,'' about a secret serviceman guarding a feisty first lady, recalls the 1994 film, ''Guarding Tess.'' And an Aaron Spelling NBC series, ''Titans,'' about an overrich, oversexed Beverly Hills family recalls, well, most of Mr. Spelling's series.</p>
        <p>Conspicuously missing from most of the networks (except WB) were new teenage shows and clones of ''Friends'' (twentysomethings living in New York), which proliferated in recent years. The reason was simply that many of these shows have flopped or fared poorly.</p>
        <p>Even executives at the youth-centric WB Network  seemed far less assured this year than they were last year when they crowed that they knew precisely what their audience wanted. For the first time in its half-dozen years, the highly successful network stumbled, partly because of some poorly received shows, partly because of the loss of WGN, a Chicago station. Now WB is plainly seeking to push the envelope with ''Grosse Pointe,'' which spoofs the kind of teenage shows that the network often offers; the actors are as pretty as they are vain and vacuous. One of the show's producers, Darren Star, helped create ''Beverly Hills 90210.''</p>
        <p>The New York preview came at an odd, maybe surreal, moment in the ever-fluid world of television. The moment -- worthy of Terry Southern -- came when ABC's huge hit, ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' was briefly eclipsed last Sunday by the opening episode of the CBS miniseries, ''Jesus.'' Variety's front-page headline proclaimed: '' 'Jesus' Tops Regis.'' (On Wednesday the miniseries was toppled by the final episode of ''Beverly Hills 90210.'')</p>
        <p>At the same time, not one but two behind-the-scenes dramas about ''The Brady Bunch'' have surfaced. In the NBC's drama ''Growing Up Brady'' which is broadcast tonight at 9 p.m., viewers immediately learn that Robert Reed and Florence Henderson, who played the parents of the six Brady children, didn't like kissing much because Mr. Reed, who died in 1992, ''likes men more than woman,'' says the actor playing Barry Williams, who played Greg, the oldest son. It's that kind of show. Fox has a show in a similar vein.</p>
        <p>In their hunger to lure increasingly fickle audiences away from cable and the Internet, network executives said selecting and scheduling programs was a roll of the dice as well as a blend of considerations. CBS, for example, picked up the medical drama, ''City of Angels,'' about a hospital in Los Angeles for another season despite poor ratings. The show, one of the first dramatic series with a predominately black cast and crew, has been a big disappointment. By all indications, CBS picked up the series for another season partly to avoid the ire of civil rights groups, which pressured the networks last year to accelerate minority hiring.</p>
        <p>''We're aware of what our position should be in terms of minorities, in terms of diversity,'' said CBS President Leslie Moonves. (But a decision by CBS not to add a series about a Mexican-American family in East Los Angeles to its prime-time lineup, which the network had been promoting, caused disappointment among Hispanic groups).</p>
        <p>Mr. Moonves, echoing his competitors at NBC and Fox, was clearly obsessed with the extraordinary success of ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' The show dominates the television landscape. (ABC added only two and a half hours of new series programs to its fall schedule).</p>
        <p>''Millionaire'' may prove vulnerable, said Mr. Moonves, who has placed probably his top new show, the Bette Midler comedy, ''The Bette Show,'' against the quiz show. ''I lay awake at night thinking how to fight 'Millionaire,' '' he said. ''And I can't figure it out.</p>
        <p>''If 'Millionaire' slips,'' Mr. Moonves said, ''that will be my one Christmas gift.'' His colleagues at NBC and Fox, looking uneasily about toward the new season, are hoping for the same gift.</p>
