        <p>Pfizer will sell billions of dollars worth of Lipitor, its popular cholesterol-fighting drug, this year, but none of those sales will be in China.</p>
        <p>The Communist government agreed last year that Pfizer would have the exclusive right to sell Lipitor in China. But days later, the government said a generic-drug company, which may have obtained the drug's patented formula on the black market, could also sell the drug.</p>
        <p>Pfizer still hopes to sell Lipitor in China, but it could lose many sales to the generic-drug company.</p>
        <p>''It is not a level playing field,'' said C. Louis Clemente, a Pfizer executive vice president.</p>
        <p>Pfizer owns a large factory in Dalian, in northern China, and sold $60 million of other drugs in China last year. It says it could sell much more if China would do more to protect intellectual property rights and to lower other barriers.</p>
        <p>The Chinese government has such high hurdles for foreign companies that several have built factories in China, only to find that they could not obtain government approval for some drugs they had planned to make there.</p>
        <p>In its trade deal with Washington last November, China agreed to change many practices that hurt American companies. Most important for American drug companies, it agreed to strengthen its protection of patents and other intellectual property rights. It has also agreed to lower tariffs on drugs, end pricing practices that favor Chinese companies and allow foreign companies to distribute their own products.</p>
        <p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry's trade group, estimates that American drug companies, which already sell about $700 million worth of drugs to China, could increase sales by more than $100 million in the first year if China, as promised, cut tariffs by 60 percent.</p>
        <p>''The potential is explosive,'' said Mark Grayson, a spokesman for the trade group. ''As people become middle class, they want Western medicine.''</p>
