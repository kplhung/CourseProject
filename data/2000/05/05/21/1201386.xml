        <p>The leadership of the National Rifle Association declared political war on Vice President Al Gore today, using speech after speech before more than 2,000 cheering members here to accuse Mr. Gore of trying to ''disarm the country'' and to exhort gun owners to organize against his election this fall.</p>

        <p>The leadership of the National Rifle Association declared political war on Vice President Al Gore today, using speech after speech before more than 2,000 cheering members here to accuse Mr. Gore of trying to ''disarm the country'' and to exhort gun owners to organize against his election this fall.</p>
        <p>''The N.R.A. is back,'' said Charlton Heston, the organization's president, who is expected to be elected to an unprecedented third consecutive term. ''All of this spells very serious trouble for a man named Gore.''</p>
        <p>The combative tone of this year's convention has been a far cry from the more muted, defensive mood of last year's event, which was held just days after the shootings at Columbine High School and was shortened to one day from three.</p>
        <p>During nearly two hours of speeches today, the organization's leaders maintained a barrage of attacks against Mr. Gore -- whom they repeatedly called a liar -- and the Million Mom March for gun control, held last Sunday, which they called a campaign event for the vice president.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't a grass-roots rally but a Gore campaign rally, scripted and coached by the White House,'' Wayne LaPierre, the organization's executive vice president, said of the march. ''It wasn't about safety. It was about Gore for president. But Mr. Gore, you're going to find out it's not smart to lie to mom.''</p>
        <p>None of the speakers mentioned the name of Mr. Gore's Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. But N.R.A. officials said that it was likely the group would endorse Mr. Bush after the Republican National Convention this summer and throw its substantial resources behind him  -- provided he does not try to distance himself too much from the group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has been an ally of the N.R.A. in Texas, signing bills to allow residents to carry concealed weapons and prohibiting municipalities from filing lawsuits against gun makers. But the governor has distanced himself somewhat from the group, needing to court centrist voters. Despite that, N.R.A. officials said today that they still view Mr. Bush as a friend.</p>
        <p>''I haven't seen anything George W. Bush has said about this organization or issue that I disagree with,'' James J. Baker, the N.R.A.'s chief lobbyist in Washington, said in an interview. ''He was, and is, a great governor from the standpoint of knowing where to put the emphasis: on prosecuting the criminal use of guns.''</p>
        <p>Even as they avoided invoking Mr. Bush's name, today's speakers repeatedly inched closer to urging N.R.A. members to vote for him, if only to defeat Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''There's a political campaign raging in America,'' said Kayne Robinson, the group's first vice president. ''If one of the candidates is elected, the Constitution, including the Second Amendment, will be safe. If the other candidate is elected, the Second Amendment will not be safe.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson, the chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, was captured on videotape in February telling an N.R.A. gathering that if Mr. Bush was elected, the group would have ''a president where we work out of their office. Unbelievably friendly relations.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has denied that the N.R.A. would have undue influence, but gun-control advocates and Mr. Gore seized on the remark to accuse the Texas governor of being beholden to the powerful group.</p>
        <p>''George W. Bush and the N.R.A. are working hip holster to hip holster to promote an irresponsible platform,'' Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman, said in response to today's remarks.</p>
        <p>Beyond today's speeches attacking Mr. Gore, there is ample evidence that the N.R.A. has been strengthening its ties to the Republican Party. Campaign finance records show that the group has contributed more than $1 million to the Republican National Committee and Republican Congressional candidates this year, but only $111,000 to Democrats.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the two members of Congress on the N.R.A.'s board of directors, Representative Bob Barr  of Georgia and Senator Larry E. Craig of Idaho, are Republicans. And today, the organization announced that Grover G. Norquist, the president of the antitax group Americans for Tax Reform and an influential figure in the Republican Party's conservative wing, had been elected to its board.</p>
        <p>Mr. Norquist's group, through its mailings and independent advertising campaigns, has been effective in helping Republican candidates in recent years. Mr. Norquist and N.R.A. officials said they have not made any plans to marry their efforts this fall, but both left open the possibility.</p>
        <p>''There is just nothing like the N.R.A., certainly there is no similar counterpart on the left,'' Mr. Norquist said in an interview. ''Gun control is going to be an expensive issue for the left. They are going to lose seats because of it.''</p>
        <p>Capping off the Republican flavor of the day, Representative J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House, was scheduled to give the keynote speech tonight.</p>
        <p>''Vice President Al Gore is the type of politician where nothing is sacred, that will say and do anything to preserve their own political future, even if that means using fear and deceptive means,'' Mr. Watts was to say, according to an advance text of his speech. ''His party used to say, 'There's nothing to fear but fear itself.' Now the vice president has nothing to offer but fear itself.''</p>
        <p>For all the recriminations between Mr. Gore and the N.R.A., the fight in many ways benefits both sides by energizing supporters. Mr. Baker acknowledged today that attacking Mr. Gore and President Clinton has helped the group's membership drives.</p>
        <p>''When people feel threatened, they tend to join and contribute,'' he said. He added that if Mr. Bush is elected and the Republicans retain control of Congress, ''we probably would lose members.''</p>
        <p>Even as they claimed responsibility for repeatedly knocking down gun-control legislation in Washington, N.R.A. officials told their members that the Clinton-Gore administration had spent the last seven years assaulting their right to bear arms. And the officials warned, often with an urgency that even some N.R.A. members found hyperbolic, that Mr. Gore would take immediate steps toward confiscating their weapons once elected.</p>
        <p>''For the next six months, Al Gore is going to smear you as the enemy,'' Mr. Baker told N.R.A. members. ''He will slander you as gun-toting, knuckle-dragging, bloodthirsty maniacs who stand in the way of a safer America. Will you remain silent?''</p>
        <p>Closing out the speeches, Mr. Heston dramatically lifted a replica of a Colonial musket and then paraphrased a popular N.R.A. bumper sticker that reads, ''I'll give up my gun when you take it from my cold, dead hands.''</p>
        <p>''As we set out this year to defeat the divisive forces that would take freedom away,'' he said, ''I want to say those words again for everyone within the sound of my voice to hear and to heed, and especially for you, Mr. Gore: 'From my cold, dead hands!' ''</p>
