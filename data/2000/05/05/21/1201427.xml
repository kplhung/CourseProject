        <p>Senator Rick Santorum, a conservative freshman Republican from Pennsylvania, barely won election in 1994, and he has been on the Democratic hit list ever since. Polls indicate that his Democratic opponent, Representative Ron Klink, a moderate, is within striking distance.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Santorum appears to have more going for him now than he did when the Democrats first took aim at him. He has toned down his hard-edged conservatism somewhat and come out in support of a number of popular government aid projects. His challenger was battered in a hard-fought, divisive Democratic primary, whereas Mr. Santorum had no primary opposition. And he has raised more than $6 million for his campaign, while Mr. Klink had to mortgage his home just to get through the primary.</p>

        <p>Senator Rick Santorum, a conservative freshman Republican from Pennsylvania, barely won election in 1994, and he has been on the Democratic hit list ever since. Polls indicate that his Democratic opponent, Representative Ron Klink, a moderate, is within striking distance.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Santorum appears to have more going for him now than he did when the Democrats first took aim at him. He has toned down his hard-edged conservatism somewhat and come out in support of a number of popular government aid projects. His challenger was battered in a hard-fought, divisive Democratic primary, whereas Mr. Santorum had no primary opposition. And he has raised more than $6 million for his campaign, while Mr. Klink had to mortgage his home just to get through the primary.</p>
        <p>What is more, Mr. Santorum is not only working his Republican base hard but, anticipating a contest that could be decided by a few points either way, has also begun to go after the Democrats' base. Last week, Mr. Santorum held a rally in the heavily black heart of North Philadelphia, serving notice that while about 95 percent of the city's blacks usually vote Democratic, he did not intend to surrender a single black vote.</p>
        <p>Surrounded by 18 black church, community and business leaders, he declared: ''We are going to actively campaign in the African-American community. We're going to fight for every vote.''</p>
        <p>One of the business leaders, Cody Anderson, praised the senator for showing up in North Philadelphia and said he was ''worthy of support'' because he had looked after the community's interests. ''I had accepted a definition from other people of the senator,'' Mr. Anderson went on. ''But everywhere I go recently, I've run into people who have told me of the projects he's supported -- computer labs, contracts, grants.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Klink's office called Mr. Santorum's visit ''puzzling'' in light of his ''lifetime rating of 25 percent from the N.A.A.C.P.''</p>
