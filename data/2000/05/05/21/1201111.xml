        <p>AS the weather warms up, who doesn't yearn to grab the blanket that's been tossed beside the fireplace and spread it out under a tree? Yet most of us automatically head back indoors when hunger strikes. But if you pack a picnic along with your book, you can savor more than just your trusty apple. And with so many portable possibilities in Westchester, the journey to the park could be as liberating as the picnic itself.</p>
        <p>Stan'z in Larchmont had picnics on the brain long before I did. Steven and Nancy Weishaus Stan'z used to run a lunch and dinner eatery in Mamaroneck. Now they make omelets, salads and gourmet sandwiches in their tiny shop on Chatsworth Avenue, all of it designed to be ordered to go. Stan'z appreciates the appeal of the picnic, proudly displaying various basket combinations in the front window. The wicker immediately caught my eye as I sidestepped a large puddle.</p>

        <p>AS the weather warms up, who doesn't yearn to grab the blanket that's been tossed beside the fireplace and spread it out under a tree? Yet most of us automatically head back indoors when hunger strikes. But if you pack a picnic along with your book, you can savor more than just your trusty apple. And with so many portable possibilities in Westchester, the journey to the park could be as liberating as the picnic itself.</p>
        <p>Stan'z in Larchmont had picnics on the brain long before I did. Steven and Nancy Weishaus Stan'z used to run a lunch and dinner eatery in Mamaroneck. Now they make omelets, salads and gourmet sandwiches in their tiny shop on Chatsworth Avenue, all of it designed to be ordered to go. Stan'z appreciates the appeal of the picnic, proudly displaying various basket combinations in the front window. The wicker immediately caught my eye as I sidestepped a large puddle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weishaus, a self-taught chef, said, ''Fine gourmet food should -- under the right conditions -- be eaten from a basket.'' So for a small deposit and given 24 hours' notice, he will include glassware, flatware and linen napkins with one's Caesar salad. Flowers will add to the total cost, but if you can get it all in one place, then why not splurge? Other choices include mini crab cakes, sandwiches on sourdough bread, couscous salad, wontons with ginger sauce, sausage, broccoli rape and sun-dried tomato pasta, and chocolate-covered strawberries. The beverage of choice? Here it's San Pellegrino, but Post Wine and Spirits just up the Boston Post Road offers an even better bet.</p>
        <p>Before you settle down with your basket (preferably in sunny Flint Park in Larchmont), stop down the block from Stan'z for one of Bradley Smith's prized pastries. Bradley's Desserts &amp; Catering does a retail business, although it caters wholesale to nearby restaurants and country clubs. This six-year-old bakery is filled with ideal picnic sweets like crumb muffins, strawberry and cream cheese croissants, glazed doughnuts, chocolate chip scones, coconut custard pies, lemon chiffon cakes, peach almond tarts and chocolate crinkle cookies. Crunchy or tender breads can be stuffed with turkey, ham, lettuce, tomato, brie or mozzarella. And Bradley's tomato and brie quiche is divine enough to transport your spread to Seurat's riverbank.</p>
        <p>Not coincidentally, Bradley's supplies another Larchmont picnic packer with its desserts. Annemarie's Feast, a full-service caterer, is an excellent option for those wanting to plan ahead. Annemarie Minke, the chef, shares the business with her brother Gus, who is administrator and Web site designer for the company. Together they have created an intimate, personal niche in the often daunting world of modern entertaining.</p>
        <p>Ms. Minke arrived in New York City after cooking on a boat in the Caribbean for a Belgian emigre. She enjoyed the hands-on work, having spent years planning advanced cooking classes for the Dutch Dairy Institute and attending hotel school in Belgium.</p>
        <p>Ms. Minke dove into catering in and around Larchmont, bravely making blind calls to customers; she got her big break by catering an event for the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers. She likes to use local supplies like Bradlye's and Post Wine, as they are not only good sources, they are her friends.</p>
        <p>Plan a picnic in advance not only to meet Ms. Minke but also to sample her fusion cuisine (the food is a mix of French and Asian; she is Dutch and Belgian). Since there is no retail counter, Ms. Minke provides tastings on Fridays from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p>
        <p>After a tasting, expect to spend $18 per outdoor guest for a sandwich, a container each of pasta, chicken and green salad and a dessert and soda. Other mouth-watering choices she has previously provided include toasted pita points, red bell pepper dip, grilled tomatoes with garlic, ratatouille, vegetarian stuffed mushrooms with shallots and Parmesan, curried rice with vegetables, carrot salad with orange vinaigrette, nuts and raisins; roast beet salad, with Dijon vinaigrette; tomato, cucumber and avocado salad; grilled chicken breast, with mango salsa; flank steak marinated in soy, ginger and garlic; poached salmon garnished with sliced cucumbers, tuna steak with fennel, penne pasta, with mozzarella and roasted tomatoes; and brownies, chocolate chip cookies and lemon squares.</p>
        <p>If planning ahead isn't your style, head to Hay Day in Scarsdale. You can get everything you need for a picnic here, and you can get it delivered. Barely three feet from the front entrance are baskets, tablecloths, paper plates and even cartons of strawberries for sale. There are also $72.99 gingham-lined baskets neatly packed with reusable plastic utensils, cups and plates; $62.99 wide French baskets for more haphazard packing jobs; and $30 pastel hampers lined with bee-patterned tablecloths to inspire a spontaneous picnic halfway through your grocery shopping. Of course, you can call and order ahead, but considering the number of people on staff, the amount of food already prepared and the specialized departments at your disposal, you might as well order with your eyes.</p>
        <p>Hay Day started in 1978 as a small country farm store in an old car wash in Westport. In 1995 it merged with Sutton Place Gourmet, and the company has bought Balducci's.  Whether you spontaneously pack a picnic while you are there or you choose merely to torture yourself over what to buy for dinner, it's certainly worth a visit.</p>
        <p>Hay Day is open every day of the week, most hours of the day.</p>
        <p>most hours of the day, so you can shopt as leisurely as you will b e able to picnic. . Fill your basket with fresh flowers and fanciful paper products; chevre buttons with sun-dried tomatoes and thyme; chips and salsa; manoucher bread stuffed with sliced sausage or charcuterie; wedges of brie from the cheese counter; decorated petit fours, and even micro-brewed beer.</p>
        <p>Hay Day may not be as personalized as Annemarie's Feast, but in this lively setting you will find what you want (or what you may not even know you want) whenever you want it.</p>
        <p>And Zachys Wine &amp; Liquor, the renowned wine distributor, is right around the corner on East Parkway.  Assuming you don't eat straight from your cart, take your picnic to Oakland Beach in Rye or to a nearby ball field to watch a sunset game.  And feel free to drive back for seconds.</p>
        <p>Corner Stone Caterers in Rye, owned by Gary and Elizabeth Stone, is a small shop that offers both catering service and spontaneous pick-ups. The selection of salads, sandwiches and desserts made in the breezy, open kitchen is limited but of good quality, and there are photographs of what can be assembled in Corner Stone's central production kitchen in Port Chester for a larger, planned event.</p>
        <p>The husband-and-wife team met at the Culinary Institute of America (she's a third- generation Rye native, he's from Africa), have three children and treat their staff as their extended family. Feel free to bring your own picnic basket. If you can't  they'll fill containers and put them in shopping bags or tan boxes tied with raffia. (They say that for a guest list  under 10, it's more cost effective to buy that day than to order ahead.)  The shop, while somewhat out of the way, is still close to Rye Beach, Rye Playland and Rye Town Park.</p>
        <p>Be sure to try the fruit salad, homemade salsa and guacamole, cold soup, veggie wraps, assorted sandwiches, 12 salads that change daily, Asian grilled salmon with cucumber, lemongrass, ginger and mint salsa, checkerboard cookies, Key lime triangles and the hazelnut meringues. As most of the savory items are quite healthy compared with the buttery pies and tarts, I'd stick with the easily sharable and more portable cookies for the last course. For your chilled bottle of pinot grigio? Try Rock 'n' Rye on Forest Avenue.</p>
        <p>If you still aren't convinced that it's time to pack a picnic, a visit to  Susan Lawrence in Chappaqua or William Nicholas &amp; Company in Katonah will seal the deal. At each you will find a staggering variety, highly personalized service, festive decor and even brochures about nearby parks in which to plop down on the grass after scouring their shelves.</p>
        <p>Susan Lawrence has owned her shop for 21 years, and her experience  shows. The retail menu changes every day. Her cookies are decorated with white chocolate rather than royal icing. Baguettes fill tall baskets, enormous black and white cookies are piled on top of chocolate truffle brownies. She will fax you her menu in the morning if you want to know what's for lunch. If you give her a bit more notice, she'll find you a basket. And she'll also make dinner, for 2 or 1,000 people.</p>
        <p>Susan, a former schoolteacher, and her brother, Mark Kramer, the co-owner, have teamed up with the chef, Dennis Zach, to create the food that is the truly the feature here:  fruit and berry medleys, tossed greens, classic Caesar salads, chicken, pasta and vegetable salads, stuffed portobello mushrooms, panini sandwiches tied with paper, vegetarian roulades, spa tuna, lowfat buttermilk cole slaw, string beans with roasted shallots and fried onions, orzo salad with oven-dried tomatoes and coriander, chicken quesadillas, fresh corn salad with avocadoes and lime, cold stuffed lobster halves, the Americano sandwich (French bread with low-fat chicken salad, grilled corn, tomatoes and wild greens), seasonally decorated cookies, sparkling lemonade and blueberry shortbread (which comes mounted on cardboard in a large, square chunk, begging for a Swiss Army knife to break it apart).</p>
        <p>After visiting Susan Lawrence, grab your wine at the Chappaqua Wine &amp; Spirit Company on King Street and then slip into a pocket park in town or better yet, the gazebo on the way to the Bell School. You can also drive to Ward Pound Ridge Reservation in Cross River (a 4,700-acre park), Lasdon Park Arboretum in Katonah (the largest publicly owned arboretum in Westchester County, a 180-acre preserve), Mountain Lakes Park in North Salem (it has five lakes tucked into 1,000 acres) or the new Rockefeller property in Mount Pleasant.</p>
        <p>These are equally good picnic spots to choose after visiting William  Nicholas and Company in Katonah, but the owner, Jeff Goodwin, and his partner, Andrew Vitrone, prefer to pack an evening meal in the summer for Caramoor music festivals and Saturday night concerts in the courtyard of the Katonah Museum.</p>
        <p>William Nicholas occupies the space of the former Katonah Library. Mr. Goodwin and Mr. Vitrone have transformed the old Victorian house into a rustic but elegant country gathering place. Brilliant black and white tiles line the floors and wainscoting adorns the walls. Track lighting illuminates carved moldings, authentic bread racks and old wooden hutches. Baskets line the tops of shelves and are piled precariously one on top of the other on the floor. An American flag decorates the open second-floor balcony, which is lined with antiques. This place is a feast for the eyes for more than just the food.</p>
        <p>But the food is excellent, too. William Nicholas can make lunches or dinners. You can plan ahead or just drop in. There are a variety of special sandwiches each day, fun dips, wraps and rolled sandwiches, buttermilk-fried chicken breast on brioche, barbecued pork tenderloin, couscous with mint vinaigrette, haricots verts with shallot crisps, Southwestern potato salad, pulled pork barbecue, muffaletta, tarragon shrimp salad with herb vinaigrette, peanut-crusted shrimp skewers with curried mango chutney, cookies and every kind of sparkling beverage you can imagine. (If you need alcohol, Katonah Wine and Liquor is around the corner on Katonah Avenue.)</p>
        <p>As I closed the swinging door behind me, I realized that here, on the porch of William Nicholas, was where I'd have my picnic. The shady barn-red veranda looks out over a tulip-lined walkway. Victorian houses line the street filled with bicycles in place of cars. After a tiresome journey, I wanted nothing more than to sit on the stoop of this country store, as a local often does in a small Vermont town. And, hey, at this picnic you can pop inside for whatever you desire without any prior planning.</p>
