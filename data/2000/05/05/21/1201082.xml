        <p>Did I hear this right? Young Butch, growing up abnormally normal in that worst of all worlds, the postwar suburbs, saves himself by choosing to turn queer as he prepares to become a serial killer, while Dad makes gyroscopes to commit atrocities overseas and Mom is rushed off to a hushed-up stay at a rest home.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Did I hear this right?

        <p>Wow!</p>
        <p>Buried somewhere in this fevered psychobabble is an interesting idea about the hero as suburbanite and that old, old idea about the eroticism of violence, but it's more than lost in wannabe left wing/right wing (it's hard to tell which) sociological purple prose. As Freud once said, sometimes a banana is just a banana and not a meditation on that horrid American Dream. And Herbert Muschamp doesn't even mention Anthony Mann's 1964 ''Fall of the Roman Empire'' (Marcus Aurelius is murdered by his loony son Commodus, who dies in a sword fight) of which ''Gladiator'' is practically a remake.</p>
