        <p>WHEN Lars Ulrich, the drummer for Metallica, marched a list of nearly 320,000 alleged music pirates over to the offices of Napster, like a schoolboy tattling on the kids who toilet-papered the gym, artist-fan relations hit a new low point. It recalled a scene in VH-1's ''Behind the Music'' episode devoted to Oasis. That band's exceptionally grumpy singer, Liam Gallagher, fled a tour a while ago to help his wife buy a London flat. Accosted by a reporter who asked, ''Does this mean you matter more than the fans?'' Mr. Gallagher exploded. ''That's right!'' he screamed, peppering his tirade with expletives. ''I matter more!''</p>
        <p>Metallica is suing Napster, a service that allows users to trade music files over the Internet, with the stated intention of shutting down piracy, not harassing the music lovers who legitimately trade music through it. But by gathering the names of users and asking that they be banned from the service, the band arguably resorted to invasion of privacy. The band's approach has so angered fans that they are organizing boycotts and merchandise burnings, and establishing anti-Metallica Web sites and bulletin boards. This impasse is even more puzzling because Metallica has long supported bootlegging at its shows, and its fan club has even facilitated the trading of demo and live tapes.</p>

        <p>WHEN Lars Ulrich, the drummer for Metallica, marched a list of nearly 320,000 alleged music pirates over to the offices of Napster, like a schoolboy tattling on the kids who toilet-papered the gym, artist-fan relations hit a new low point. It recalled a scene in VH-1's ''Behind the Music'' episode devoted to Oasis. That band's exceptionally grumpy singer, Liam Gallagher, fled a tour a while ago to help his wife buy a London flat. Accosted by a reporter who asked, ''Does this mean you matter more than the fans?'' Mr. Gallagher exploded. ''That's right!'' he screamed, peppering his tirade with expletives. ''I matter more!''</p>
        <p>Metallica is suing Napster, a service that allows users to trade music files over the Internet, with the stated intention of shutting down piracy, not harassing the music lovers who legitimately trade music through it. But by gathering the names of users and asking that they be banned from the service, the band arguably resorted to invasion of privacy. The band's approach has so angered fans that they are organizing boycotts and merchandise burnings, and establishing anti-Metallica Web sites and bulletin boards. This impasse is even more puzzling because Metallica has long supported bootlegging at its shows, and its fan club has even facilitated the trading of demo and live tapes.</p>
        <p>Money is the most obvious spur in this conflict. Mr. Ulrich and his mates consider themselves hard workers who just want fair compensation. The rising anti-Metallica forces accuse them of blind greed. But a deeper conflict resonates behind the money issue: the question of a rock star's control of his art, his time, even his own identity.</p>
        <p>Rock has always been a reckless medium, and its most frenzied element is the audience. In ''Fandemonium!,'' a 1989 overview of crazes, hysteria and hype, the writers Fred and Judy Vermorel described the rock audience as ''spreading the joyful virus of desire.'' Infectious fan energy is most frequently represented by the throngs of teeny-boppers who have chased down artists from Elvis to 'N Sync.</p>
        <p>That appealing enthusiasm has a dark side. Rock has often been compared to a pagan rite; there's always a point at which acolytes demand the sacrifice of their idol, and when the idol (say, Liam Gallagher or Lars Ulrich) tries to flee, they pursue and rip him to shreds. An audience that turns on a star is the rock musician's own often-expressed worst nightmare.</p>
        <p>The Who's ''Tommy'' chronicled the making and breaking of such a pop messiah. ''Nashville,'' the 1975 Robert Altman movie that shifted the scene to country music, ends with a star being murdered by a fan. These fictions gain their resonance from sometimes tragic real-life parallels.</p>
        <p>The Who experienced what its songwriter, Pete Townshend, feared when 11 fans were crushed to death during a riotous Cincinnati concert in 1979. The crazed lone fan gained a monstrous avatar when Mark David Chapman murdered John Lennon in 1980. A decade later, Kurt Cobain's mixed feelings of guilt about and resentment of his mass audience may have contributed to his suicide.</p>
        <p>Metallica was already poised for a death match with some fans. The band has been enduring a backlash since 1996, when short haircuts and an ostensibly cleaned-up sound on the album ''Load'' earned it accusations of selling out. Slanderous anti-Metallica Web sites predate the Napster conflict, expressing contempt for the group's creative choices and forcing the band into a defensive position.</p>
        <p>Metallica is also the kind of band most likely to fear losing control to the crowd: auteurs of the 1960's-era model, inward-looking and somewhat serious. The very thing diehard fans admire in Metallica, its diehard insistence on control over its music, now pits them against the band.</p>
        <p>Metallica built its reputation by adhering to a standard of artistic purity that can't be maintained if its work tapes become widely available on the Internet, which happened with its latest single, ''I Disappear,'' apparently prompting the band's lawsuit. Dr. Dre, the next most vocal Napster opponent, has forged a similarly careful, ''pure'' oeuvre within hip-hop. Contrast these artists with Napster's strongest supporters. Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit, soon embarking on a Napster-sponsored summer tour, devotes himself as ardently to his entrepreneurial side projects as he has to his music. Chuck D, the founder of Public Enemy, values community outreach and political impact as much as songcraft.</p>
        <p>Embracing the future in the form of MP3 technology, these artists are willing to sacrifice the album format, the greatest means of control musicians ever enjoyed. Before the album era of the 1960's, pop stars had to court fans with each new single. The ascendancy of albums shifted the power to the stars, who indulged their own impulses through cover art and song sequencing and on the tracks that surrounded each album's potential hits.</p>
        <p>Increased corporate influence has already diminished this control; today's albums are too often marred by compromises artists make with their labels. But online technology scares executives and artists alike, because it favors those wild fans. The artist must return to the role of the suitor standing, gift in hand, at the audience's door. And because every recorded move -- work tapes, demos, appearances with Conan O'Brien -- can be downloaded, distributed and even remixed using software that multiplies daily, he may not even decide what's in his candy box.</p>
        <p>Metallica's move against Napster is much like the angry shove the rock star gives the unlucky hundredth fan who clamors for a chat, a kiss, an autograph. ''I matter!'' the artist shouts. But we've returned to a moment when the fans matter more.</p>
