        <p>EYEWITNESS</p>
        <p>Reports From an Art World in Crisis.</p>
        <p>By Jed Perl.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 349 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>A New Republic Book/Basic Books. $35.</p>
        <p>Sincerity is Jed Perl's strong suit. He really cares about what he sees as a crisis in the art world, that small domain of artists, aficionados, collectors, dealers, museum officials and writers in which he has long been a well-known critic. His concern is evident in his disdain for the forces -- embodied in art stars, influential writers and art institutions -- that, as he sees it, have ''distorted the art scene'' and in the energy with which he attempts to draw attention to artists and works that still produce ''the thrilling experiences that only art can offer.'' Except for first and last chapters diagnosing the sorry state of art affairs, ''Eyewitness'' consists of reviews written for The New Republic during the second half of the 1990's; these reports on particular exhibitions are unified by Perl's rejection of ''conventional taste and conventional wisdom'' in the name of values of art older and truer than those now ascendant.</p>
        <p>The rejection of convention has been a standard trope of art criticism since the 19th century. Once artists, freed from subservience to patrons, began producing for a more or less free market, they were bound to compete among themselves, as individuals and members of groups, for fame and fortune. Art in the modern sense of the word is defined by its distance from the norm of mass production: unique, handmade and shaped by the producer's genius, art objects ideally aim at aesthetic rather than commercial value. While high-mindedness can paradoxically reap high prices, avant-gardes from Impressionism through all the 20th century's isms to Abstract Expressionism have advanced their claims as the bearers of art's renewal against the compromises of established styles.</p>
        <p>Perl's criticism follows this venerable pattern with a curious twist: he speaks in the voice of a pure-minded outsider disdaining commercial success, but in the name of older modes of art-making, against the triumphant new. His taste is eclectic, but he seems most attached to figurative art in modernist styles, like the figure paintings of R. B. Kitaj and the landscapes of Temma Bell. His ideal artist, he tells us, is ''a traditionalist with radical ambitions,'' and this is clearly how he conceives of himself. What has made such a position possible was the change in the structure of the art market that followed the success of the American avant-garde of the 1950's: collectors became eager to make the new into the hot, and critics and institutions soon followed them. Youth, once associated with marginality, became a prime element of success. Perl, in contrast, can't seem to find anyone under 45 to celebrate wholeheartedly.</p>
        <p>Art, as Perl thinks of it, makes public a private experience, produced in the studio. What gives it value is what the artist is able to put into the work: ''What counts is that whatever the artist is thinking or feeling is absorbed into the look, the character, the intricacies of the work.'' Its appreciation therefore calls for serious looking that over time allows the viewer to grasp the elements of a work and understand how they function (or don't) together. Today, Perl believes, people don't want to take the time; they want instant gratification, art that delivers a simple message at a glance. Today's aesthetes, in fact, look for meaning more in the surroundings of art than in art itself -- in its relation to fashionable political causes or its celebrity. Even an older artist who has acquired Modern Master status, Jasper Johns, produces no more than ''effects . . . so drearily localized that the refinements close down a picture instead of pulling us into a world that has an integrity all its own.'' Meanwhile, artists still working to create things complexly beautiful enough to repay close looking are ignored. Perl, their champion, calls art lovers to his side; offering the inside story, he promises -- as critics always do -- the real thing.</p>
        <p>I agree with many of Perl's judgments about artists and works, and disagree with others. That's normal in criticism. His sincerity gives his views weight; he's a partisan, not a hack. Unfortunately, the close viewing his judgments rest on is not often enough reflected in his writing. Sometimes an incisive phrase provides illumination, as when he observes that the painter Cy Twombly ''presents self-conscious awkwardness as virtuosity,'' or points out that for Picasso and Matisse, designing for the ballet at a time when they were not following their own radical modernism into abstraction, ''dance, a kind of abstraction that was nevertheless centered on the figure . . . must have had a deep, instinctive appeal.'' All too often, however, Perl is content with art-appreciation bromides (''When an artist draws from life, he wants to give an imaginative dimension to actual things'') or the kind of art writing that conveys enthusiasm or distaste without giving much of a sense of what has provoked it: Leland Bell's compositions ''have a hard-edged yet free-flowing exuberance''; ''Kertess's idea of a good painting is an elegant surface that does nothing (as in Brice Marden) or next to nothing (as in the Agnes Martins).'' This tendency toward the tin ear sometimes brings with it a tin eye: someone who can describe Andy Warhol's work, circling around a handful of obsessions -- death, glamour and packaging -- as ''material that had no private meaning'' for the artist has not followed his own prescription of close looking.</p>
        <p>To look closely at an artist like Warhol, however, would involve going beyond denunciation to an attempt to understand how the art world has evolved. The closest Perl comes to this is in an essay in which he seems to hold a handful of critics and theorists responsible for the breakdown of serious looking. It's natural for a critic to think that critics shape the art world. But why did those critics shape it and not writers like himself? Without an understanding of the art system, he can't see his own obedience to its laws: despite his sincere wish not ''to become a part of the P.R.'' that serves success, he is delighted when a famous artist he likes, Balthus, is promoted with an interview by David Bowie in a magazine that Bowie underwrites and Perl writes for. In art, unlike national politics, not everyone feels the need to be an outsider, but in both domains the only outsiders we're likely to hear about regularly are those, like Orrin Hatch or Jed Perl, for whom that title names a niche well within the apparatus.</p>
