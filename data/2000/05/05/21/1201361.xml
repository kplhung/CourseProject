        <p>If over the next month or so, Court TV finds that its ratings suddenly spike, reaching the sort of numbers once enjoyed by ''Seinfeld,'' the network can thank players, coaches and executives in the National Football League. They will be watching for news about one of their own, Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis, who has been accused of murder.</p>
        <p>Lewis, a three-time Pro Bowl player, and two co-defendants, Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeney, are accused of stabbing Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar on Jan. 31 during a brawl after a post-Super Bowl party.</p>
        <p>As the trial begins, most likely this week, people across the N.F.L. -- from Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, to those in the Ravens organization, to players on vacation or working out preparing for July training camps -- will be monitoring what happens. They will be reading newspapers, listening to coverage on the radio and watching Court TV. Tuning in to the cable channel is apparently the preferred choice among N.F.L. types to get the latest information on the case.</p>
        <p>The Lewis trial is probably one of the most discussed topics in the N.F.L. right now.</p>
        <p>This is not to make light of a serious situation. Two people were killed, and Lewis, if found guilty, could spend the rest of his life in prison. If that did happen, the N.F.L. would receive the kind of tarnish that could stain its image for years. And there is still a murder case pending with another N.F.L. player, the former Carolina wide receiver Rae Carruth, who is accused of masterminding a plot to kill his former girlfriend, who was pregnant at the time. She died in December after being shot in November. The baby survived.</p>
        <p>But right now the league is focused on the Lewis trial because it is at the forefront. And with so much at stake -- a man's freedom, closure for the families of the victims and the image of a billion-dollar sports league -- it is no wonder that many people in the N.F.L. seem to be following the case so closely.</p>
        <p>''If what he is accused of is true, then I don't feel sorry for him at all,'' one National Football Conference general manager said. ''But on the other hand, this is my league, a league I care about very much, so for his sake and the league's sake, you just hope he was not involved. Either way, this is something I am going to spend every free minute of my time following.''</p>
        <p>''It's always talked about,'' one American Football Conference head coach said. ''When we have staff meetings, one of the questions someone always asks is, 'Anything going on with the Lewis case?' When I talk to other coaches, Lewis's name always comes up. My players are also always talking about it.''</p>
        <p>Hundreds of miles away from the Atlanta courthouse where the legal proceedings are taking place, the Lewis trial is a frequent topic among officials at the N.F.L. Players Association headquarters in Washington. When general managers speak to each other, complaining about the lack of salary-cap room or bragging about their draft picks, a comment or two about Lewis always slips into the conversation. When players get together for off-season workouts, Lewis is brought up often.</p>
        <p>No group within the N.F.L. -- except for perhaps the Ravens -- is watching the case more closely than the league office in New York. It is safe to say that as the trial begins, they are at Defcon 1. N.F.L. security officials are staying in constant contact with the Atlanta police and other authorities. When the flood of negative publicity again begins as the trial heats up, league officials will constantly remind the news media and fans that the vast majority of its players are good citizens, which is indeed the case.</p>
        <p>Privately, Baltimore team officials, while believing in Lewis, are beginning to think that even if he were cleared of the murder charges, but found guilty of one of the lesser counts, such as obstruction of justice, the league may still suspend him for at least several games.</p>
        <p>The Ravens officials believe that the N.F.L. will want to make an example of Lewis: if you do not choose your friends more carefully, you can end up being tried for murder. And even if you are found not guilty, you will still have to deal with the N.F.L.</p>
        <p>Part of Lewis's defense will most likely be that he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time and that he had nothing to do with the stabbings. As his case unfolds, no matter what happens, there will be lots of people watching, many of them a part of the game Lewis plays.</p>
        <p>Young Is Taking His Time</p>
        <p>The agent for Steve Young said the San Francisco quarterback would most likely take ''every last second'' before deciding whether to play again.</p>
        <p>Leigh Steinberg, said his 38-year-old client had been medically cleared to play despite sustaining a series of concussions during his 15-year career. The latest occurred last season when Young was hit in the head by a blitzing defensive back.</p>
        <p>Steinberg disagreed with some members of the news media who have portrayed Young as a person in denial about the possible health risks of playing again. Steinberg has had seminars for his clients regarding the risks of concussions, and Young has attended all of those meetings. Steinberg also said Young had passed every test administered to him.</p>
        <p>It's Never Too Early</p>
        <p>Some head coaches believe that championships are won months before the season begins, and the teams that put the most work into passing and training camps reap the rewards during the season. If that is the case, the Tennessee Titans and the Baltimore Ravens are on their way to good seasons.</p>
        <p>In Tennessee, Steve McNair is throwing the ball crisply and, for the first time in years, is playing on healthy feet. McNair has worked well in passing camps in the new offense, which while still run-oriented, allows him more freedom. ''We're going to spread people out a little more than we have been and we're going to give the quarterback more options,'' Coach Jeff Fisher said.</p>
        <p>In Baltimore, the Ravens were happy with their passing camp, because players, even the rookies, have almost completely digested the imaginative offense of Coach Brian Billick.</p>
        <p>''Now, rookies have a little more of a base,'' Billick said. ''We're not having a lot of mistakes -- a few. They won't be quite as lost the next time.''</p>
        <p>Around the League</p>
        <p>One of the good guys in football, the personnel man Bobby Grier, who was fired by New England, was hired as a scout in Houston last week. . . . Giants linebacker Corey Widmer remains a possible salary-cap casualty on or after June 1. . . . Indianapolis coaches say quarterback Peyton Manning has spent this off-season working as hard as ever. That is a scary thought, because Manning has little to work on. Manning is setting an example for the rest of the team, and making a statement that, despite its success last season, the franchise still has a long way to go before reaching the Super Bowl. . . . Green Bay tight end Mark Chmura, after being charged with felony third-degree sexual assault of the family's babysitter, will most likely be released by the Packers next month.</p>
