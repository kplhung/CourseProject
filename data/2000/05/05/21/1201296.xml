        <p>AFTER taking the television by storm, ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' is about to cash in.</p>
        <p>With more time to sell to advertisers at higher prices than any show has ever asked, ABC is poised to make profits on the game show that will dwarf what any previous show has ever taken in. Estimates for next season already range from $300 million to as much as $600 million -- the latter figure is possible if the show's ratings hold up and ABC continues to broadcast the series year round.</p>
        <p>As the network television selling season kicked off last week, advertising executives said ABC was asking for prices up to $400,000 for every 30-second commercial in ''Millionaire'' next fall. The show is expanding to four nights a week in the new season, which means that ABC will be selling four hours a week in this highest priced real estate on television. Each hour will contain about 14 30-second commercials for ABC to sell. The show costs about $1 million an hour to produce. Even after commissions for advertising agencies, ABC could make up to $4 million in profit on every episode.</p>
        <p>The prices are expected to vary, depending on the deals that ABC strikes with advertisers to buy time on ''Millionaire'' in conjunction with other shows. So all the profits may not be directly assigned to ''Millionaire.'' But if its ratings hold up, the show will certainly earn more profit than any previous show, and may even approach by itself the most profit any network has made in a television season, about $500 million.</p>
