        <p>TEMPTING, tempting . . . .</p>
        <p>It has been a long time since the prospect of putting cash in the bank held any attraction for most people. Interest rates were paltry, and the eager money forsook income investments to chase capital gains in the stock market. That drove prices so high that the average dividend paid by companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 is now barely 1 percent.</p>
        <p>But the Federal Reserve's drive to head off any surge in inflation is returning the luster to the word ''yield'' -- on bonds, of course, but also on such prosaic and convenient products as certificates of deposit and money market funds, especially for consumers willing to shop a little.</p>
        <p>And, surprisingly, a bit of negotiating -- even a ploy as simple as inquiring whether your bank might be willing to improve on the rate posted in the window -- can also pay off.</p>
        <p>''If you've got more than $50,000 or so, you can always get 25 to 50 basis points more, often by just asking,'' said Warren Heller, research director at Veribanc, which analyzes banking trends. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, banks do not advertise or even acknowledge that this goes on, but some customers of major banks have found otherwise.</p>
        <p>For many of the most succulent rates, the place to look is the Internet -- both the electronic offshoots of traditional banks and the stand-alone cyberbanks like Wingspanbank.com, E-Trade Group's Telebank, X.Com and USAccess Internet Bank.</p>
        <p>A survey of online banking published last Wednesday by Consumer Action, an advocacy group in California, found ''much better interest rates, not only on savings accounts but on checking and money market accounts and certificates of deposit,'' than were found elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Their examination of 19 virtual banks, all federally insured, and 10 traditional ones showed, for example, that online operations paid about a half-point more interest on six-month C.D.'s, and that 4 of the 19 required smaller minimum deposits than any of the ordinary banks.</p>
        <p>As promotion-minded as many a dot-com, Wingspanbank is temporarily offering an eye-popping 10 percent interest rate on checking accounts that Kevin Watters, its senior vice president for marketing, called ''probably the highest in the country.'' The rate applies to amounts from $100 to $10,000 and runs until Sept. 1; after that. the accounts will pay 3.10 percent for deposits of at least $2,500 and 4.50 percent for $10,000 and up.</p>
        <p>''We can pay such high rates because we don't have the physical infrastructure that brick-and-mortar banks have,'' Mr. Watters said, adding that Wingspanbank's computer system, built from scratch, avoided the technical incompatibility problems that traditional competitors face after numerous mergers.</p>
        <p>ON 12-month certificates of deposit, Wingspanbank immediately echoed last week's half-point increase by the Federal Reserve for overnight money, bringing its rate to 7 percent. The average bank in the country offered 5.47 percent on 12-month C.D.'s after the Fed move, up from 5.42 percent the previous week, according to Bank Rate Monitor.</p>
        <p>Wingspanbank, owned by Bank One, is based in Wilmington, Del., but you may not have to look beyond your hometown institutions for newly enticing deposit rates.</p>
        <p>Citibank in New York, for example, has a cyberspace facility that it calls Citi f/i (for financial interactive). A visit to citifi.com, its Web site, found its insured money market account paying a 5.50 percent rate, for an annual yield of 5.65 percent, with a $1,000 minimum. As is common with Internet banks, Citi f/i reimburses any A.T.M. fees charged to its depositors by other institutions for withdrawals from its accounts.</p>
        <p>Citi's online rates are well above the 4.59 percent rate (4.70 percent annual yield) offered at Citibank branches on ''preferred'' money market accounts, which require deposits or loans totaling at least $50,000 in a customer's accounts. Customers with $25,000 to $49,999 in their accounts get a 3 percent rate, yielding 3.05 percent annually.</p>
        <p>The difference reflects ''lower infrastructure costs,'' said Maria Mendler, a Citibank spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Textbook economics, however,  holds that prices are made by supply and demand, not costs, leading analysts to suggest that Internet banks' rates are high because they are little known and because consumers hesitate over the idea of a bank they cannot visit.</p>
        <p>''If something goes wrong with a transaction, it's not like just driving down to the branch and taking it up with the manager,'' said Mr. Heller of Veribanc, noting that credit unions often combine very close proximity with high rates.</p>
        <p>And local banks sometimes bid so aggressively for money that there is no need to send it away to get a higher rate, he said. ''Sometimes there's a pleasant surprise.''</p>
