        <p>FACE TO FACE</p>
        <p>A Reader in the World.</p>
        <p>By Lynne Sharon Schwartz.</p>
        <p>Beacon, $22.</p>
        <p>In ''Face to Face,'' her second collection of personal essays, the novelist Lynne Sharon Schwartz resembles one of her fictional characters: a sensitive, family-oriented semibohemian whose tastes are literary but refreshingly unstuffy and whose sense of humor tends toward the sly and offbeat. The loose theme that runs through these 14 pieces, most of them previously published, is the ways in which we do -- or do not -- connect with one another and with the world around us. Thus, in ''Help,'' Schwartz reflects on the complex balance of power and intimacy that informs her relationship with her maid. ''Absence Makes the Heart'' charts the chronology of a friendship transformed by physical distance. Schwartz's strongest essays demonstrate her gifts as a storyteller. In ''Being There,'' for instance, she dramatizes the sense of extended family that had developed among the long-term tenants of her Upper West Side building before a devastating fire scattered them. (Could this building be the inspiration for the family-run Upper West Side apartment building at the center of Schwartz's most recent novel, ''In the Family Way''?) In a moving essay titled ''Found in Translation,'' Schwartz explores the unexpected ways in which her translation from Italian into English of a Holocaust memoir, Liana Millu's ''Smoke Over Birkenau,'' enriched her as a writer. Less satisfying are some very brief sketches that have the feel of short stories that never gelled and two longer pieces, one about telephone etiquette and the other about caring for a friend's cat, that despite their wit read like rambling ruminations on an assigned topic.</p>
