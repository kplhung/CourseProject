        <p>For its sesquicentennial, Harper's Magazine has issued an anthology the size of a calculus textbook. The warning label is printed on Page 175. ''Mental gluttony, or overreading, is a dangerous propensity,'' Lewis Carroll writes. ''We know that bread is a good and wholesome food, but who would like to try the experiment of eating two or three loaves at a sitting?''</p>
        <p>Reader, I have eaten them. There were a few obstacles to the mastication. First, the trouble of eating in loaves what is normally eaten in slices. Second, an absence of what Lewis Carroll calls ''ticketing.'' Lewis H. Lapham and Ellen Rosenbush, the editors of ''An American Album,'' have supplied no headnotes to guide the modern reader. For example, Stephen A. Douglas's 1859 defense of a territory's right to choose slavery is presented for rumination, but whether it should be digested by the stomach for sophistry or the stomach for full historical disclosure, Lapham and Rosenbush do not advise. In 1927 Sarah Comstock wrote what may have been the first modern magazine profile (the subject: Aimee Semple McPherson; the method: start with the glamour, then carefully chip all the artifice off the gestalt). But there is no hint as to who Comstock herself was, and whether she wrote any more.</p>
        <p>Third, marketing. There can't have been any reason to reprint Nathaniel Hawthorne's travel vignette ''Uttoxeter,'' Walt Whitman's poem ''Song of the Redwood-Tree'' or Bernard DeVoto's puff piece ''The Century'' other than the privilege of printing their names in the table of contents. Even famous authors have mediocre days.</p>
        <p>The fourth difficulty was the most substantial, but it should probably be understood as the challenge of the meal, rather than a mere drawback. Like loaves of bread, magazines are best if consumed before a certain date. They stale faster than books. In part, this is because they are more American. (Newspapers stale even faster, because they are even more American.) E pluribus unum was the motto of a widely read magazine when the United States adopted it. Magazines aim to be timely and smart, not wise or profound. They have the planned obsolescence that Tocqueville observed in American architecture. A new issue comes out next month. You are supposed to throw the old one away, and most people do. One greets their return from the dustbin of history as one might an ex-lover: fondly, then warily. What do they want? And what, by the way, did we ever see in them?</p>
        <p>''Gestures! Gestures!'' cries an anarchist in a Joseph Conrad story reprinted here, an anarchist impatient with an haute bourgeoise who playacts at revolution. ''Mere gestures of her class.'' Few institutions are consistent over 150 years, but if any single thread does link every issue of Harper's, it would be a concern with finding and keeping readers among the well-to-do. This is natural, and maybe tautological. Magazines have to make money steadily. Consider, by way of contrast, writers of books. Merely individuals, they can sink costs almost indefinitely. If they want to write in styles ahead of or beyond the popular taste, they are free to ruin their own and their families' finances and their books may still see print. But magazine editors don't have that luxury. If they stop paying their bills, the magazines die. And so the hardy magazines are those that know their readers well enough to manage psychological blackmail. They locate, provoke and offer to soothe their readers' anxieties. Then they prick them once more for good measure.</p>
        <p>A successfully blackmailed upper-middle-class readership isn't necessarily a bad thing, either for the cause of literature or for the upper middle class, and it doesn't single Harper's out from the crowd. But Harper's has been at the job longer than any other literary monthly, and this anthology shows how its techniques have changed over the years, and how they haven't. In its first decade, the Harper's reader seems to have worried about what one editorial called ''Union Saving.'' In the hope that a compromise over slavery would avert war, the reader was happy to hear ''the rabid abolition conventicle'' denigrated. The Civil War dispelled this pernicious wishful thinking, but by creating new fortunes it raised new anxieties. In 1864, Harper's was already deprecating speculators in the stock market (''a collection of wild beasts at feeding-time'') and the lifestyle of the nouveaux riches (''besotting themselves with excess and dallying pleasure'').</p>
        <p>In the Gilded Age that followed, Harper's prudently discontinued direct attack. New money was remaking the American bourgeoisie, and the magazine took upon itself the tasks of flattering the new burghers on their financial power and reassuring them of their social worth. In the late 19th century, the two emotions that readers seem to have been willing to pay to indulge were wry chuckles and informed moral outrage -- condescension in its comic and tragic varieties. Now, informed moral outrage is perhaps the best thing about the bourgeoisie, and Harper's in this period tackled crimes ranging from ''the wanton and wholesale plunder of our public lands'' to the exploitation of ''the little slaves of capital'' who worked in sweatshops at a tender age. The wry chuckles are less winning. In a Sarah Orne Jewett story, a newspaper reporter writes up an elderly Vermont couple's visit to Manhattan as a droll item. The couple never realize they're being spoofed, but no harm is done them. (Moral: Urbanity is superior but not nasty.) In a Stephen Crane tale, a little girl begs $5 from her father and leads the village children into a sugar binge in a candy shop and a haircut purge in a barbershop. (Moral: Market cycles are as headstrong and innocent as a child.) The editor of Harper's in the Gilded Age was George William Curtis, who favored women's rights and regretted the foreign anarchists in Chicago. In an 1870 editorial, he excoriated American gentlemen for thinking themselves too good for politics, and the double edge of this critique is typical of him: Is he upbraiding gentlemen for being squeamish, or politicians for being vulgar? Exactly. A dose of status anxiety and a dose of smugness for everyone.</p>
        <p>With the advent of the 20th century, the magazine's tactics shifted. The overclass now knew it was the overclass, and knew it so well it felt guilty. Drollery and indignation gave way to new modes. Instead of informed moral outrage, there was informed moral calm. The crime statistics aren't as bad as they sound, Clarence S. Darrow wrote. The younger generation is merely more honest, not more licentious, Will Durant counseled. To help the reader sidestep socioeconomic guilt, there was escapist nostalgia. Willa Cather's ''Enchanted Bluff'' and Theodore Dreiser's ''Country Doctor'' harked back to a sweet world not yet poisoned by class strife. A gloomier set of stories took the opposite tack, bringing readers to an uncanny recognition of their own rapaciousness. In Edith Wharton's ''Quicksand,'' a mother scares off her son's fiancee, because what he is willing to do for money would corrode the girl's soul. (Moral: It would corrode yours, too.) In Jack London's ''Sun-dog Trail,'' an American Indian helps a young white couple hunt down and murder a man in wild Alaska for no discernible reason. (Moral: Choose your hiking partners carefully.)</p>
        <p>Horrified recognition is not yet responsibility. But with the end of World War II came a new confidence and a new clarity. In 1945, Eugene V. Rostow condemned the government's wartime internment of Japanese-Americans. The article's promptness is as startling as its no-nonsense tone. There is a similar forthrightness to Henry L. Stimson's 1947 discussion of the motives behind the decision to drop the atomic bomb on Japan. No doubt there are imperfections to both reports, but as magazine articles they are remarkable; despite their guilt-inducing, anxiety-producing subject matter, they leave the reader's guilt and anxiety alone. After World War II the confidence of America's ruling class was evidently unshakable. Psychological blackmail had to be abandoned. The only way to hook readers' interest was with thoroughly researched, artfully written, open-ended investigations, and so the golden age of American magazines dawned.</p>
        <p>It lasts about 150 pages, from Katherine Anne Porter's profile of Gertrude Stein to Seymour M. Hersh's 1970 expose of the United States Army's massacre of Vietnamese civilians at My Lai 4. Though much abridged here, Hersh's is nonetheless the longest piece in the volume. It is also the best. Though classic in form, it appeared in a somewhat wilder Harper's, where a new editor, Willie Morris, was attracting writers who took on the Establishment in style as well as substance. (Morris, for instance, was willing to devote nearly a whole issue to Norman Mailer's first-person account of marching on the Pentagon.) The risk-taking put Harper's at the avant-garde of the New Journalism, which applied fiction's narrative techniques to fact, an experiment that seemed to reflect a taste for boundary violations at large in the culture. But in magazine sales, the experiment didn't pay. And shortly after, for a number of reasons, the nation's confidence foundered. Some wonderful reporting follows -- including Darcy Frey's narrative of three high school basketball players from the Coney Island projects and L. J. Davis's account of the savings and loan debacle -- but the lure of an insecure overclass has proved irresistible, and in the last few decades Harper's has reverted to old habits. In new guises, knowingness and sentimentality have crept back in.</p>
        <p>Again, this hardly singles Harper's out from the crowd. And there has been artfulness as well as pleasure in the hustle. It was Harper's that discovered that David Foster Wallace could be so knowing about knowingness that it took on a whole new texture -- an editorial achievement akin to figuring out how to make crack by crystallizing cocaine. At the Illinois State Fair, Wallace searches with intellectual faux navete for ''the sort of regional eroto-political contrast the East Coast magazine is keen for,'' while, upside down and ogled by carnies, his prom date from 12 years prior rides a roller coaster known as the Zipper and achieves bliss. To indulge in so many ideological thrills and carnal jollies at once no doubt corrupts. But as the former prom date says, you ''ought to try just climbing on and spinning.''</p>
        <p>TOWARD the end of the millennium, odd, century-straddling parallels occur to the anthology reader. Pico Iyer's week in the Los Angeles airport recalls George Ward Nichols's nine days on a Mississippi steamboat -- the feel of travel without having to move, the exotic scene in a domestic locale. Ryszard Kapuscinski experiences a 1969 war in Honduras much the way Frederic Remington experienced 1898 in Cuba: as a young reporter roughing it, shaken out of a quaint-seeming adventure by gore. And the righteous anger of Lewis Lapham in 1994, when newspapers declined to speak ill of a dead Nixon, weirdly echoes George William Curtis's fury in 1878, when newspapers treated the death of Tammany Hall's Boss Tweed ''as if he had been a hero or statesman.'' In the name of the public interest, the Harper's editor tsk-tsks the popular reaction. The target seems safe -- not only dead but a known villain -- and the editorial stance a bit unfair: Is the editor defending the people from emotional manipulation, or chiding them as softhearted dunces? Exactly.</p>
        <p>The Gilded Age, in other words, is alive and well. And so, contrariwise (as Tweedledee would say), the occasional snobbish jab should probably be overlooked. Harper's has, after all, held onto its glossy pages and its readership without becoming a retail outlet -- a rare feat -- and most of the puncture wounds it inflicts are well deserved. It is a difficult thing to sell a magazine without a celebrity's face on the cover, and Harper's pulls it off. One hundred fifty years on, the magazine still engages politics and culture seriously, but not so seriously that they have the consistency of turnips. Anchovies, rather. Heed Lewis Carroll's advice, and sample in moderation to avoid dyspepsia.</p>
