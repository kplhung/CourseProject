        <p>Trouble is so much in the air in KICK IN THE HEAD (Doubleday, $22), Steven Rinehart's debut collection of short stories, that when, in the title story, one character reassures another, ''Everything's going to be fine,'' it registers as a particularly pathetic self-delusion. The speaker of the line is a college student fallen hard for a veterinarian. The trouble is that the doctor is a diabetic with a habit of neglecting her insulin shots. She's also a chronic drunken driver with a knack for plowing into people and property. She's also married to the student's film studies professor. Clearly, nothing about this arrangement will be fine. Some of the sharpest of Rinehart's stories are about men caught up in similarly inexplicable, often dangerous attractions: a Boy Scout's fascination with his unhinged tentmate; a high school teacher's obsession with a troubled student; a college dropout's love for his best friend's girlfriend. Rinehart has a talent for entering his stories in midstream, then revealing in small, unsettling ways just how badly things have already unraveled for his characters. A hitchhiker left stranded in the desert in ''Burning Luv'' seems worthy of sympathy until he reveals his previous experience with abandoning and being abandoned. Shortly thereafter, he casually produces a weapon, to chilling effect. A suburban insurance man in ''LeSabre'' seems merely inept until a calamitous Friday night exposes his own vulnerability. ''I'm not in control,'' he admits. ''I am miles behind.'' Rinehart's stories are full of such moments, offering a view into the ways a life can go wrong.</p>
