        <p>Sharon Anderson, who lives in a housing project in Canarsie, Brooklyn, watched her 8-year-old son, Jeremiah, as he awoke in a small wooden cabin at a camp in Fishkill, N.Y. He walked over to the window and peered out into the still woods surrounding the cabin.</p>
        <p>''Oh my God, it's so beautiful,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Jeremiah, a soft-spoken boy with cerebral palsy and an interest in electricity experiments, and his mother were attending a special weekend at the camp, Hidden Valley. It is one of five camps run by the Fresh Air Fund, a nonprofit agency that began providing summer vacations to needy children from New York City in 1877.</p>
        <p>Prospective disabled campers are invited to stay at the camp for a weekend free, along with their families, to help them decide whether they want to stay at the camp over the summer. As an added perk, the families get a chance to enjoy a few spring days away from the city.</p>
        <p>During his stay, Jeremiah went boating for the first time. He took a rowboat out on Grace Pond with Roberto Gil, a counselor, and he later went fishing, for the second time in his life.</p>
        <p>''The key to fishing is just hold it still and be patient,'' his mother told him, and he held a fishing pole out over a wooden dock and waited for a fish to bite.</p>
        <p>Jeremiah's weekends are not usually so serene. He lives in a three-bedroom apartment in the Breukelen Houses with seven other people: his mother, a sales associate at the Toys ''R'' Us on Flatbush Avenue; her fiance, Neville Murphy; two sisters, Lauryn, 11, and Cydney, 14; two brothers, Joshua, 2, and Matthew, 7; and a nephew, Elijah, 4. Last year, he spent the summer at a day camp in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>For him, the weekend at camp was a peek at a very different world. ''In the city you don't have a place to walk to go get breakfast,'' he said. ''Here you do, and they have a pool.''</p>
        <p>The families who went to the 25 acres of forest and fields in Camp Hidden Valley visited the arts and crafts cabin, where the children made Mother's Day cards, went hiking and fishing and took a tour of the camp's small farm.</p>
        <p>About half of the 132 children, ages 8 to 12, who attend the camp during its four summer sessions are disabled. Last weekend, parents of 16 potential campers visited to see if Hidden Valley was a good fit for their children.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to know what type of counselors they have -- how interested they are,'' said Sophia Morales, a resident of the Gun Hill section of the Bronx who visited with her son Michael.</p>
        <p>Another mother, Robyn Collins, a corrections officer on Rikers Island who lives in a housing project near Lenox Avenue in Harlem with her 9-year-old son, Jvon (pronounced Jay-von); an 8-year-old granddaughter, Ayana; and three foster children, said her children needed a break from the video games they frequently played, Resident Evil and Parasite Eve.</p>
        <p>''They need a break from the violence,'' she said of the games. ''It's very peaceful and very relaxing here.''</p>
        <p>As she watched her children row their boats in the pond, Ms. Collins shared reflections on her son, who has a speech impediment that makes him a little shy. ''He's opened up some since he's gotten here,'' she said. ''He's got a big old Kool-Aid grin, and he's already talking about when he comes back.''</p>
        <p>After seeing the cabins where their children would be staying and meeting some of the camp counselors, Ms. Collins, Ms. Morales and Ms. Anderson all said they hoped that their children would decide to attend the camp this summer.</p>
        <p>''When I put them on the bus in July, I'm going to be content,'' Ms. Collins said.</p>
        <p>Families who wish to inquire about registering their children for a Fresh Air summer vacation can call (800) 367-0003. Anyone interested in making a tax-deductible contribution can send a check to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018. It costs the fund $1,036 to provide a summer camp vacation for a child, but donations of any amount are welcome.</p>
