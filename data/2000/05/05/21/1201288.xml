        <p>RACING commentators ticked off the aspects surrounding Adam Petty's death last week at the New Hampshire International Speedway: a fourth-generation racer killed at age 19 in a practice run, just weeks after the death of his great-grandfather, Lee, a Nascar champion three times over.</p>
        <p>Few pointed out that the young driver died a long way from Daytona, Fla., and in the heart of Yankee country. But Nascar has traveled far since days when the first racers came roaring down from the Blue Ridge Mountains in their bootlegging cars, itching to find out who was the fastest. Today racers average 150 m.p.h. a lap and over 200 on the straights.</p>
        <p>Tom Wolfe spread the fame of Junior Johnson, one of the greatest drivers of the 1950's and 1960's, who was sentenced to two years in prison after he was caught firing his daddy's still. Wolfe's Esquire article, ''The Last American Hero,'' later appeared in his book, ''The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine Flake Streamline Baby.'' He described Southern culture, carefully explaining that good old boys were not necessarily old or boys.</p>
        <p>The South no longer needs translation. And along with country music and culinary quirks like grits and red-eye gravy, Nascar is now part of American culture. Of the 21 race tracks in the Winston Cup Series, the top races, only nine are in the Southeast. Since 1988 Nascar has come to tracks in Nevada, Indiana, New Hampshire, Arizona and California. There are also races in New York and Delaware.</p>
        <p>While old-timers trained by outrunning revenuers, many of the young ''shoes,'' including Jeff Gordon, Nascar's current superstar, learned their down-shifting and trail-braking at the Skip Barber School, considered the Harvard of racing schools. Some even have college degrees, and a few colleges like the University of North Carolina at Charlotte offer courses in racing.</p>
        <p>Still, folks down South miss the bad old days when stock cars raced on dirt and the drivers drank hard, banged one another's cars and brawled after the race.</p>
        <p>''There's a parallel with the N.F.L.,'' says Humpy Wheeler, the longtime czar of Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte, N.C. ''In the old days it was just a bunch of thugs playing in the back yard on a Sunday afternoon. Now it's in every living room.''</p>
        <p>Entry into the nation's living rooms has its price, and Wheeler is clearly ambivalent about it. Part of that price, he said, is formality. ''I'm the only one left with a nickname,'' he said. ''Used to be, everyone had a nickname -- Fireball Roberts, Banjo Matthews, Tiny Lund.''</p>
        <p>In those days a seat belt might mean a length of rope tied around a driver's waist. Cars, too, came right off the dealer's stock on the showroom floor. When Bill France Sr. and other racing-car enthusiasts gathered in Daytona Beach in 1947 to establish the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, they believed that ordinary people would want to watch what their own cars could do. At the first official Nascar-sanctioned race at the old Charlotte Speedway in 1949, at least 10,000 spectators showed up. One of the participants was Lee Petty, a bakery truck driver from Level Cross, N.C., who wrecked his borrowed Buick Roadmaster and had to hitchhike home. But before his death this year at age 86, Petty went on to many victories, and watched his son, Richard, his grandson Kyle and his great-grandson, Adam, become Nascar stars.</p>
        <p>Daytona's first races were on the beach. In Georgia, Virginia and the Carolinas, the tracks were cut into the red clay. The great racing families of Atlanta started out running moonshine.</p>
        <p>Slowly, change crept in. The dirt tracks were paved over. Nascar's first race on pavement at Darlington in 1950 had a pear-shaped track because the owner wanted to preserve a minnow pond.</p>
        <p>One thing about Nascar has remained unchanged: it's still a white man's sport. A few women compete at the lower levels. Charlie Scott, a black man, won a Winston Cup race in 1963, but only a few blacks race today; none at the top level. Costs and sponsors may be factors: it costs $10 million to run a team.</p>
        <p>In 1971, the sport changed forever when tobacco ads were banned from television. R. J. Reynolds began to support Nascar as a way to advertise its products. The group's top series was renamed for Winston cigarettes. The teams became more professional as the purses grew; at least $2 million today compared to $1,500 in 1949. Audiences grew, too. Estimates put attendance at the Winston Cup Series races last year at 6 million; more than 150 million television viewers watched.</p>
        <p>The personalities themselves became businesses. Among the most successful is Richard Petty, whose cowboy-hatted profile identifies his trucks and a line of products ranging from a limited 1991 edition of Pontiac Grand Prix automobiles to hot sauce. There is now even a Nascar Barbie.</p>
        <p>Gordon, Nascar's brightest star, has brought in a lot of young male fans, but many old-timers see him merely as a winning machine, and hard to identify with. ''We still haven't had that driver who could do for us what Ali did for boxing, what Namath did for football, what Babe Ruth did for baseball,'' Wheeler said. ''We need the guy who can transport us out of the sport and into the mainstream, who will take us onto the cover of Time rather than the cover of Sports Illustrated.''</p>
        <p>Wheeler misses the old days. ''We still need that rough, tough, good old boy who can mix it up on the track,'' he said. ''We don't want 20 guys walking in wearing Brooks Brothers suits and Gucci shoes, drinking tea down in the pit lane.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 28, 2000, Sunday  An article last Sunday about Nascar racing misstated the given name of the first black man to win a major race. He was Wendell Scott, not Charlie.</p>
