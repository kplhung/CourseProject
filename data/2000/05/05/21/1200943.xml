        <p>''Hot, fast and dangerous.'' Robert Crais's neat description of Modex Hybrid, an explosive compound used in missile launchings, applies just as well to DEMOLITION ANGEL (Doubleday, $24.95), a flammable techno-thriller with the kind of force that knocks out windows. In contrast to the casually plotted escapades of Elvis Cole, his preternaturally cool private eye, this out-of-series adventure pitches a volatile protagonist into a complex story in which a master bomber known as Mr. Red is targeting bomb technicians in a ''dominance game'' of destruction.</p>
        <p>When a Los Angeles bomb squad specialist is killed by one of Mr. Red's ''simple, elegant'' devices, Carol Starkey, the detective assigned to the case, almost blows it. The thriller field is overrun with shellshocked cops, both male and female, who are drinking and smoking and brooding themselves into early graves from survivor's guilt, and the neurasthenic Starkey adds nothing to this self-destructive breed. But, just in time, she remembers that she is a trained expert at this infernal game. (''The bomb was a puzzle,'' and once she holds it in her hands, ''she became a piece in a larger whole that she was able to see in ways that others couldn't.'') Although Crais throws up a daunting smoke screen of subplots to break her will, including a showdown on the Internet, Starkey shapes up nicely and keeps her finger on the fuse.</p>
        <p>In PLACES IN THE DARK (Bantam, $23.95), Thomas H. Cook turns his poetic sensibility to the murky narrative of two brothers who fall in love with the same woman, a fragile beauty with ''dead green eyes'' and a clouded past. Murky is good, because events occur in foggy places: in a seabound town in Maine; in the shadowy corridor between time past and time present, which is 1937; and in the uneasy mind of the storyteller, a young lawyer named Cal Chase. For his entire life, Cal has been told that he is the pragmatic, sensible son -- the one who takes after his dour father. His brother, Billy, is the golden child, the imaginative and adventurous son who inherited his mother's love of Romantic poetry, along with her penchant for self-dramatization. In fact, the brothers are ''two answers to the same riddle,'' and it seems that Dora March, as the mysterious stranger calls herself, must have them both.</p>
        <p>Billy's murder and Dora's sudden departure propel Cal on a painful journey of self-discovery that, almost incidentally, also reveals the facts of Billy's death and the sad (if not so surprising) truth about Dora. Although the journey is overly protracted, it is swept along by Cook's artistry, his insights into broken people, his austere imagery of the barren landscapes that attract them. And, in the end, it takes Cal to that secret place where he has always dreaded going -- his own heart.</p>
        <p>The Great Dismal Swamp that oozes through upper North Carolina is a great place to live, if you're a bug -- or the Insect Boy, a disturbed teenager from these rural parts who kidnaps two young women and drags them into the marshland at the beginning of Jeffery Deaver's twisted thriller, THE EMPTY CHAIR (Simon &amp; Schuster, $25). In defiance of all logic, the search party consists of two lone women, one of them a local cop, the other the lover and protegee of Deaver's quadriplegic criminalist, Lincoln Rhyme, who happens to be in the neighborhood for experimental spinal surgery. But if logic has no place in this pulse-raising chase, scientific smarts and psychological cunning do, and the imperious Rhyme is a master on both fronts as he analyzes the forensic evidence on his trusty chromatograph and guides the manhunt from his snazzy motorized wheelchair (''red as a Corvette'').</p>
        <p>Most of the simple-minded male characters who go thrashing through the woods are sacrificed as swamp trash once the plot lurches into the dizzying back turns for which this crafty author is noted. But the women thrive in this dank place, as does their captor. Under Deaver's scrutiny, the boy becomes a fascinating case study in obsession, and his heightened awareness of the ways of spiders and wasps, butterflies and moths turns this swamp into a beautiful and treacherous place.</p>
        <p>The Borgias would not be bored at the State University of Michigan, that snake pit of academic politics where Lev Raphael's soothing sleuth, Nick Hoffman, teaches composition and staunches blood feuds among the faculty. LITTLE MISS EVIL (Walker, $23.95) digs in its satiric claws when the entire English department is overhauled to make way for the newly endowed chair of women's literature and the new department of white studies. Members of the eviscerated faculty, evicted from their offices and banished to basement broom closets, speak early and often of wanting to strangle the hateful Camille Cypriani -- Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ''literate but sexy best sellers about lonely women in Paris'' -- and eventually someone does. But tons of verbiage come between, and too much of it has to do with extraneous matters in Nick's personal life. Who cares about the sleuth's sexuality, his lover's career or even his cousin's brain tumor when a latter-day Borgia is on campus?</p>
        <p>The clamorous voices in Louise Doughty's subversive village mystery, AN ENGLISH MURDER (Carroll &amp; Graf, $23), are either laughing or screaming at the cozy genre formula they seem to be trapped in. True, there's not been a peep from Mr. and Mrs. Cowper, but that's because they're dead, rotting away in the dreary cottage where they were murdered. And no one's heard a word from their teenage daughter, who seems to have disappeared. But everyone else in the tiny hamlet of Nether Bowston, in the picturesque county of Rutland, has much to say about the murders, and also about their narrow lives, and they proceed to say it in aria-like chapters that pretty much demolish all those tidy and reassuring conventions of the English country mystery. In her sane but unforgiving style, Doughty strips away the artifice about murder to show ''how mundane it is -- how it can happen and mean almost nothing'' to people trapped in the isolation of their own small worlds.</p>
