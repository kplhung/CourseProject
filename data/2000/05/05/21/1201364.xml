        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's friends and advisers described him yesterday as calm and relieved after his withdrawal from the United States Senate race that consumed much of his mayoralty for the last six months.</p>
        <p>''You could see that he was someone who had a burden lifted from his shoulders,'' said Peter J. Powers, the former deputy mayor and one of Mr. Giuliani's oldest friends. Mr. Powers and about a dozen aides crowded into Mr. Giuliani's office on Friday after he made his announcement that his health and his still-undecided treatment for prostate cancer were more important to him than his campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>''He sounds great,'' said Bruce J. Teitelbaum, Mr. Giuliani's campaign manager. ''It's like night and day.''</p>
        <p>The mayor had no public events scheduled yesterday, although he did tape an interview at Rockefeller Center for NBC's ''Meet the Press'' news program today. Mr. Powers said Mr. Giuliani had planned to play golf with his son, Andrew, but was prevented by yesterday's cold downpour.</p>
        <p>Donna Hanover, Mr. Giuliani's wife, spent her day at Gracie Mansion with the couple's two children.</p>
        <p>Yesterday was an especially quiet day at the Giuliani campaign headquarters in Lower Manhattan, where aides bitterly complained that advisers to Representative Rick A. Lazio were trying to hire away staff members as early as 7:30 a.m. That was when Juleanna Glover Weiss, Mr. Giuliani's campaign press secretary, received a call asking whether she would join up with Mr. Lazio, the state Republican Party's choice to replace Mr. Giuliani. She gave no answer.</p>
        <p>That, campaign advisers said, was the only contact they had from Mr. Lazio's office. ''The mayor said, 'I want to help you guys,' '' one campaign aide said, referring to the support he has promised Mr. Lazio. ''You think they'd call us.''</p>
        <p>Mayoral advisers also said yesterday that they truly believed Mr. Giuliani's lengthy ruminations at his news conference about becoming a different man since his illness were authentic, even though many of the mayor's critics were skeptical.</p>
        <p>''I've never seen him like this,'' one adviser said. ''He is completely different. I think this guy has gone through a complete life change.''</p>
        <p>And that, the adviser said, is the real reason Mr. Giuliani did not want to run against Mrs. Clinton. ''For him, a big part of it was the fight,'' the adviser said. ''He doesn't want to fight any more. He just doesn't. Let Rick Lazio fight with her.''</p>
        <p>The mayor, the adviser insisted, never had a visceral dislike for Mrs. Clinton, even though he repeatedly attacked her as left-wing, a fake Yankee fan, a carpetbagger and without any qualifications to run for Senate.</p>
        <p>The adviser even said that Mr. Giuliani referred to Mrs. Clinton as ''a nice lady'' after she grabbed his hand and said hello at the Inner Circle dinner show in Manhattan in March.</p>
        <p>''You can't go into battle like that,'' the adviser said, referring to the campaign and Mrs. Clinton, ''if you don't want to rip their guts out.''</p>
        <p>The adviser also said that what the public was seeing now of Mr. Giuliani -- a thoughtful, humbled, more human mayor compared to the tough guy of a few month before -- is the man his friends describe.</p>
