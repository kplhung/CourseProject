        <p>OPERATION ROLLBACK</p>
        <p>America's Secret War Behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
        <p>By Peter Grose.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 256 pp. Boston:</p>
        <p>Houghton Mifflin Company. $25.</p>
        <p>L ooking back at the cold war, Americans can rightly be proud of the policy of containing the Soviet Union that was followed by every president from Harry Truman to Ronald Reagan. It was steady, prudential and defensive, and its most articulate spokesman was the diplomat George F. Kennan. Today Kennan is probably best remembered as a scholar of Soviet affairs who opposed the Vietnam War, who urged moderation in our dealings with Moscow and whose elegantly written memoirs are invaluable to any understanding of the postwar era.</p>
        <p>But the Kennan of the 1940's was an enthusiastic cold warrior. While serving in Moscow in 1946, he warned in his famous 8,000-word ''long telegram'' to the State Department that the Soviet Union ''was committed fanatically to the belief that with U.S. there can be no permanent modus vivendi,'' that Moscow was determined to destroy ''our traditional way of life.''</p>
        <p>By 1947, according to Peter Grose's ''Operation Rollback,'' Kennan was back in Washington and proposing a radical program of ''political warfare.'' He wanted to employ sabotage, guerrilla tactics and propaganda behind the Iron Curtain as a way of encouraging the local populations in Russia and the Soviet bloc to rise up; at the very least, he intended to make trouble for the Soviets.</p>
        <p>Grose, the biographer of Allen Dulles, the director of central intelligence under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, tells the riveting story of brave, patriotic and staunchly anti-Communist Americans and refugees in their struggle against the Soviet leviathan. He is fair-minded and sympathetic to the intentions of these courageous men and women. But he also reveals the ineptness, navete and folly of those who believed that anti-Communism alone could overcome the conflicting ambitions and aspirations of the polyglot refugees.</p>
        <p>After receiving authorization from the National Security Council, Kennan and his staff started fashioning specific projects to undermine Communist power in Eastern Europe through a variety of operations ''in which the originating role of the United States government will always be kept concealed.'' Since both the recently formed Central Intelligence Agency and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were wary of engaging in sabotage or paramilitary operations, the only alternative was to create a secret agency, the Office of Policy Coordination. Neither officially under the control of the C.I.A. nor part of the State Department, it hovered, as Grose puts it, ''with little accountability, in between.'' This allowed the C.I.A. to assert that it had not engaged in illicit subsidies, bribes and arms stockpiling, ''which may have been literally, though deceptively, true.'' Not until 1952 was the office folded into the C.I.A.</p>
        <p>As Grose tells it, the use of refugees and displaced persons from the Soviet bloc was a melancholy tale. In many instances, Soviet agents infiltrated the training camps in Europe and reported their doings back to Moscow; guerrilla warfare against the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe all too often resulted in the capture and execution of these anti-Communist warriors. In one notable example of Soviet retribution, the reports of the notorious British spy Kim Philby, who in 1949 was stationed in the British Embassy in Washington, brought about the arrest of resistance fighters parachuted into Albania by the Office of Policy Coordination.</p>
        <p>While the guerrilla and paramilitary operations were signal failures, the activities of Radio Free Europe and the liberal anti-Communist Congress for Cultural Freedom were relatively successful. Both groups were secretly financed by the coordination office, but were presented to the public as private organizations. Der Monat in Germany and Encounter magazine in Britain were distinguished journals of opinion and perhaps would not have survived if they had depended on private backing. (Without government funding, the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. has written, ''organizations of the democratic left have no obvious and reliable sources of support.'') But when the intellectuals who edited and wrote for these publications found out that they were being duped by the American intelligence services, a shadow was cast on the honesty of the anti-Communist intelligentsia. On the other hand, had European intellectuals known the journals were financed by the American intelligence services, many of them would most likely never have agreed to be connected with them.</p>
        <p>In the interest of full disclosure, I should point out that I myself was employed as an editor on East Europe magazine in the late 1950's and early 60's. Published by the Free Europe Committee, the American arm of Radio Free Europe, the monthly journal printed articles and news from behind the Iron Curtain. I was unaware of any government financing, but shortly before I left the magazine, I did hear rumors that the C.I.A. was somehow involved with the committee. Nonetheless, the editors and writers, as far as I knew, were never told what to write or how to write it.</p>
        <p>Well before the end of the Eisenhower administration, the idea of ''rollback'' was abandoned; covert operations in the third world -- in Iran and Guatemala and, under Kennedy, against Cuba -- were becoming the preferred tools of American policy makers. In this same period, Grose reveals, a 1956 presidential inquiry by two of the most respected veterans of the cold war -- David Bruce and Robert Lovett -- made a judgment that ''undercut the entire concept of political warfare as it was played out within the O.P.C. and C.I.A.''</p>
        <p>The two elder statesmen declared: ''The C.I.A., busy, moneyed and privileged, likes its 'kingmaking' responsibilities. The intrigue is fascinating -- considerable self-satisfaction, sometimes with applause, derives from 'successes' -- no charge is made for 'failures.' ''In a devastating conclusion, the two authors asked plaintively, ''Should not someone, somewhere in an authoritative position in our government . . . be keeping in mind the long-range wisdom of activities which . . . are responsible in a great measure for stirring up the turmoil and raising the doubts about us that exist in many countries of the world today?''</p>
        <p>Many years later George Kennan regretted his creation. ''The political warfare initiative was the greatest mistake I ever made,'' he told a Senate committee. ''It did not work out at all the way I had conceived it.''</p>
