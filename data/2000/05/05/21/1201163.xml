        <p>FOR the first time since the Garden Conservancy introduced its national Open Days Program six years ago, gardens on Nassau's North Shore will be among the 416 private gardens throughout the United States this year to welcome visitors. Three gardens in Kings Point, Great Neck Estates and Sands Point will show off their natural finery today.</p>
        <p>''There's a huge interest in gardens in that area, but until this year we didn't have a regional representative who could organize the tour,'' said Deborah Friedman, a spokeswoman for the conservancy. ''We're sure that this initial foray will be so successful that next year we'll have many more candidates.''</p>

        <p>FOR the first time since the Garden Conservancy introduced its national Open Days Program six years ago, gardens on Nassau's North Shore will be among the 416 private gardens throughout the United States this year to welcome visitors. Three gardens in Kings Point, Great Neck Estates and Sands Point will show off their natural finery today.</p>
        <p>''There's a huge interest in gardens in that area, but until this year we didn't have a regional representative who could organize the tour,'' said Deborah Friedman, a spokeswoman for the conservancy. ''We're sure that this initial foray will be so successful that next year we'll have many more candidates.''</p>
        <p>Kyrman Harvey, 37, a local designer, volunteered his services, and the three gardens on view are his creations; predominately casual gardens that feature a variety of shrubs and perennials and require minimal maintenance.</p>
        <p>''They don't look like collectors' gardens,'' he said, ''and need just a tab of work to keep from being wild. There's a fine line to hold to keep a garden from going sloppy.''</p>
        <p>Included in the tour are:</p>
        <p>*The Harvey Garden in Kings Point, a one-and-a-half-acre waterfront garden surrounding his parents' home on Manhasset Bay. Ten years in the making, the garden contains about 200 varieties of plants, including 30 classic roses, hydrangea, euphorbia, iris, viburnum and deuzia. (Open from 2 to 6 p.m.)</p>
        <p>*The Bodian Garden in Great Neck Estates, which Mr. Harvey calls ''an ideal town garden in the Gertrude Jekyll style.'' Bordering a rambling home on a modest lot, the rectangular plot sports a knot garden of box, variegated box and lavender cotton; a reflecting pool behind a yew hedge, and 40 varieties of plants that bloom from February through November. (10 a.m. to 2 p.m.)</p>
        <p>*Fern's Glade, an estate in Sands Point with a two-acre garden that has been in the works since 1993 and features a woodland garden, dotted with antique ornaments and furniture, a kitchen garden and mixed beds and borders. (10 a.m. to 2 p.m.)</p>
        <p>The line-up today will also include three public gardens: Planting Fields Arboretum in Oyster Bay, the John P. Humes Japanese Stroll Garden in Mill Neck and, in Sayville on the South Shore, Meadow Croft, the John E. Roosevelt Estate. Twenty-three gardens will be available for touring during remaining Eastern Long Island Open Days on June 17, July 15 and Sept. 16. Information, (888) 842-2442.</p>
