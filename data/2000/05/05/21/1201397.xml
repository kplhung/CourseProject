        <p>There was one quarter left, and the Syracuse seniors stood on the sideline with their stunned teammates and avoided staring at the scoreboard. The Orangemen had blown their fifth lead of the game in the final seconds of the third quarter to a pesky Georgetown team.</p>
        <p>After leading by three goals, Syracuse was now tied in the quarterfinals of the men's National Collegiate Athletic Association lacrosse tournament. Syracuse (13-2), the top-ranked team in the nation, faced elimination. The senior attackman Ryan Powell turned and told his teammates that this was not how he wanted his career to end.</p>
        <p>And it didn't. Scoring four straight goals to start the fourth quarter, Syracuse squeezed by Georgetown, 17-13, advancing to the semifinals next weekend at the University of Maryland. Syracuse made the final four for the 18th consecutive year.</p>
        <p>''For our seniors, if you lose you're going home and we didn't want to end like that,'' said Powell, who scored four goals and had four assists. ''I think that was the key today. Every timeout, every huddle that we had, guys were chatting in other people's ear: 'We're not going to go out that way.' ''</p>
        <p>In the second game, No. 3 Princeton (11-2) survived a furious fourth-quarter push by Maryland (11-5) and won, 10-7.</p>
        <p>Georgetown was able to tie the score twice in the waning minutes of the third quarter. With just over two minutes left and the Hoyas down by 10-9, Steve Dusseau, a sophomore midfielder for Georgetown, scored on a long shot.</p>
        <p>Syracuse snatched the ball off the face-off, sending three slick passes downfield, where the sophomore attackman Liam Banks was waiting and slammed the ball in. It was a 10-second play, executed with the smooth efficiency of an assembly line. But Georgetown pushed downfield fiercely, funneling the ball to Dusseau, who fell to his knees as he shoved the ball past the junior goalie Rob Mulligan to tie it at 11-11.</p>
        <p>But in the fourth quarter, the Hoyas (12-3) seemed disorganized. They won only one of nine face-offs.  After outshooting Syracuse by 12-4 in the third quarter, they were outshot by 14-8 in the fourth.</p>
        <p>Syracuse midfielder Chris Cercy, who entered the game ranked first in the nation in face-off winning percentage, won 24 of 34 for the game.</p>
        <p>Georgetown, which entered the game ranked third in the nation in scoring, was held two goals below its regular-season average.</p>
        <p>''It's disappointing for sure,'' said the senior attackman Scott Urick, who scored five goals for the Hoyas. ''We've been working hard to come away with a national championship and that won't happen this year. But no one has to make any apologies. We all played as hard as we could.</p>
        <p>''Eventually, you run out of time.''</p>
        <p>In the other game, Princeton scored six straight goals over a  17-minute span, amassing a 9-2 lead over Maryland with four minutes left in the third quarter. Seven players scored for the Tigers, including the senior midfielder and Ivy League player of the year Josh Sims, who had two goals and two assists.</p>
        <p>Maryland rallied with five of the next six goals, including the final four, but it was not enough.</p>
        <p>Women's Final</p>
        <p>Maryland (20-1) and Princeton (15-3), who both scored first and then spun out large leads by halftime in Friday's semifinals, will will meet in the title game at 3 p.m. Sunday at the College of New Jersey in Ewing.</p>
        <p>Princeton's last appearance in the title game was in 1995, when it fell to the Terrapins -- who went on to win the next four national championships. Earlier this season, the Tigers lost to Maryland, 14-6.</p>
