        <p>For years, makeshift boats, one called Child of Amazon and the other Town Hall, were anchored off Pier 25 in TriBeCa. Town Hall served as the home base of David Pearlman, his wife, Betsy Terrell, and their family's jazz band, the Flying Neutrinos.</p>

        <p>For years, makeshift boats, one called Child of Amazon and the other Town Hall, were anchored off Pier 25 in TriBeCa. Town Hall served as the home base of David Pearlman, his wife, Betsy Terrell, and their family's jazz band, the Flying Neutrinos.</p>
        <p>The couple departed a few years ago and are now in Minnesota, and a Hungarian-born artist named Balazs has been living on the boats.</p>
        <p>With the endorsement of the local community board, the Hudson River Park Trust, which controls Pier 25, informed Balazs last summer that it wanted the boats gone, and threatened to take action if they were not voluntarily removed. Nothing happened. And so on May 8 the trust  moved.</p>
        <p>''I came off the boat in my dinghy to the pier and there they were -- a couple of park policemen and 12 or 15 other people,'' Balazs said. They announced plans to tow the boats, and refused to let him back on them.</p>
        <p>They were towed to Pier 40 in Greenwich Village, where a salvage company hired by the trust tried to hoist them onto a barge to take them to storage facilities at Port Newark. One boat made it, but the other broke up as it was being lifted.</p>
        <p>Balazs said all his possessions were on the boats, including his passport, his green card, his cat and his dog. By the time the trust let him retrieve his belongings, he said, all he got was ''the dog and half a bag of garbage.''</p>
        <p>Noreen Doyle, a trust spokesman, said it would have been dangerous to allow anyone on the boats while they were being moved. She added that Balazs and the Pearlmans had more than ample warning that this would happen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearlman insisted that the action was the culmination of ''a vendetta'' by the trust because ''they didn't like the way'' the boats looked. He said he had never been officially contacted about moving them. ''If they had just asked me to leave,'' he said, ''I would have.''</p>
