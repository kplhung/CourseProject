        <p>IN Jean-Pierre Bekolo's short film ''La Grammaire de Ma Grand-mere,'' the Senegalese director Djibril Diop Mambety deploys a bit of French wordplay to explain the productive tension at the heart of his work. ''My grandmother always tells me to contradict my grammar,'' he declares. ''Grandmother'' (grand-mere) stands for African ancestral wisdom, while grammar (the homonymous ''grammaire'') refers to the rules and techniques of moviemaking, a historically Western, paradigmatically modern art form. Like other great iconoclasts of film, Mambety revolted against the conventions of the medium in order to express his faith in it. And like many African artists and intellectuals who came of age in the decades after colonial rule, he was preoccupied with the politics of autonomy and cultural self-determination. His career -- interrupted by 17 years of silence and truncated by his premature death, from lung cancer, in 1998 -- consists of a series of attempts to recast ''grammaire'' in the voice of ''grand-mere.''</p>

        <p>IN Jean-Pierre Bekolo's short film ''La Grammaire de Ma Grand-mere,'' the Senegalese director Djibril Diop Mambety deploys a bit of French wordplay to explain the productive tension at the heart of his work. ''My grandmother always tells me to contradict my grammar,'' he declares. ''Grandmother'' (grand-mere) stands for African ancestral wisdom, while grammar (the homonymous ''grammaire'') refers to the rules and techniques of moviemaking, a historically Western, paradigmatically modern art form. Like other great iconoclasts of film, Mambety revolted against the conventions of the medium in order to express his faith in it. And like many African artists and intellectuals who came of age in the decades after colonial rule, he was preoccupied with the politics of autonomy and cultural self-determination. His career -- interrupted by 17 years of silence and truncated by his premature death, from lung cancer, in 1998 -- consists of a series of attempts to recast ''grammaire'' in the voice of ''grand-mere.''</p>
        <p>A selection of Mambety's work -- including his only full-length features, ''Touki-Bouki'' (1973) and ''Hyenas'' (1992) -- will be shown at the Film Society of Lincoln Center's sixth annual African Film Festival, which runs through June 1. Many of the festival's other films -- more than 30 in a variety of lengths, genres and styles from the diverse regions of the continent -- suggest that Mambety's playful account of his own work might also serve as a shorthand theory of African cinema.</p>
        <p>The conflicts between tradition and modernity, between Africa and Europe, surface in different forms, according to the sensibilities of individual filmmakers and the varying conditions of Africa's national film industries. Two fictional features from Senegal -- which continues, in part owing to economic support from France, to be one of the continent's major centers of film production -- suggest both the irrelevance of Europe and the subtle persistence of the colonialist legacy. Moussa Toure's ''TGV'' (1997) uses the somewhat stagey conceit of a bus trip from Dakar to the Guinean capital, Conakry, to explore the comic and melodramatic interactions between a cross-section of contemporary Africans, including a disgraced government minister and his wife, a petty criminal, a clutch of holy men, and a woman fleeing her polygamous husband. On their way through a war zone, the group is joined by a pair of French anthropologists, whose fate when the bus is captured by a rebel army offers an ironic commentary on entrenched ideas of racial superiority, national pride and universal brotherhood.</p>
        <p>There are no whites at all in Safi Faye's gorgeous, haunting ''Mossane'' (1996). Based on a Wolof legend about a girl who brings disaster to her village by refusing to submit to an arranged marriage, the film has a stark, Sophoclean emotional power. Shot in exquisite color against desolate expanses of coastline and grassland, ''Mossane'' is nonetheless set in a recognizably contemporary world. A mother's complaints about a younger generation which forsakes the old ways and is beguiled by exotic styles of dress and behavior strike a decidedly modern note. But tradition and modernity, Africa and Europe are not static, opposed concepts impelled toward a simple moral collision: the man whom the beautiful, defiant heroine must marry works abroad for a French conglomerate. His competitors for her favor are a doltish local herdsman and a soft-spoken student in Western dress who has been rusticated to the village during a university strike.</p>
        <p>It's interesting to compare their somber, earnest passion with the affectless rage of another young couple in revolt, the outlaws Mory and Anta in Mambety's ''Touki-Bouki,'' whose criminal jaunt through urban Senegal is impelled by their empty, decadent passion for France. As they cruise the streets of Dakar, Josephine Baker's hymn to ''Paris, a corner of paradise on earth'' harrasses the soundtrack like a broken record. Mambety's legendary film is clearly a generational document, part of the global cinematic and cultural earthquake that produced ''Bonnie and Clyde'' and ''Easy Rider'' (to both of which it is often compared), as well as ''Zabriskie Point,''  ''Weekend'' and ''Badlands.''</p>
        <p>But in place of the flamboyant, romantic nihilism that entranced his Western contemporaries, Mambety's lyrical vision expresses a deep pessimism about the liberation its protagonists so desperately crave.</p>
        <p>Mory and Anta live in a state of internal exile, made literal when Anta boards an ocean liner bound for the earthly paradise of France. An exile's return from that imperial Eden sets in motion Mahamat Saleh Haroun's extraordinary ''Bye Bye Africa'' (1998), an anguished, self-reflexive meditation on the state of African cinema. Mr. Haroun plays a filmmaker, also named Haroun, whose mother's death summons him home to Chad after 10 years in France. Taking account of the changes wrought on his hometown, N'Djamena, by war, AIDS and economic stagnation, he is especially appalled to find the movie theaters of his youth -- old-fashioned dream palaces with names like the Scheherazade, the Rio and the Vogue -- reduced to crumbling desuetude, wrecked by war and displaced by video clubs and satellite dishes.</p>
        <p>As he embarks on a new project -- a movie called ''Bye Bye Africa'' -- Haroun journeys through a world in which filmmaking seems an absurdity, an impossibility, but still somehow necessary. An angry mob seizes his camera and accuses him of stealing their images. An actress who had appeared in a film he made about AIDS tells him she has been shunned because people think she must really have the disease. A local producer explains that there is no money for Haroun's project.</p>
        <p>''You have a camera there, why not use it?'' the producer asks, pointing to the portable VHS machine Haroun lugs through N'Djamena. ''But then it wouldn't be cinema,'' the director replies. ''Bye Bye Africa,'' shot on digital video in two weeks for $50,000, is unmistakably a work of cinema, meticulous in its craftsmanship and alive to the vital paradoxes of the medium. It's also an unsparing anatomy of a serious cultural crisis. ''If there are no movie theaters, how can I make films for African people?'' Mr. Haroun wondered in a telephone interview during a recent visit to New York. ''The situation is very grave. This movie is like a scream to express my rage.''</p>
        <p>But it is also, he said, ''a manifesto for all African filmmakers.'' He continued: ''I discovered after shooting this movie that we can make movies within our own means. The way is maybe to make movies in digital video. I discovered that it gives me a spirit of resistance, a kind of liberty. At last I'm going to be independent.'' In this spirit, the film ends with Haroun giving his video camera to his movie-mad nephew. Does this gesture represent the renewed promise of modernity, or the passing on of an embattled tradition -- grand-mere or grammaire? Or does it hold out the possibility that these might be, at last, synonymous?</p>
