        <p>Only two hours after Taiwan's new president made his inaugural address, authorities in Beijing released a surprisingly temperate response, charging him with a lack of sincerity but not repeating the dire threats and invective of recent weeks.</p>
        <p>In his first speech as president today, Chen Shui-bian promised that unless the mainland attacked Taiwan, he would not declare independence, change the country's official name of ''Republic of China,'' or take other overt steps to establish Taiwan's formal independence.</p>
        <p>Given that Mr. Chen had called for just such acts in years past, it was a measure of how far he has traveled to gain support among Taiwan's nervous majority and to avoid provoking Beijing into a military attack.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Chen, whose Democratic Progressive Party still includes many champions of independence, did not say Taiwan was a part of ''one China,'' as Beijing has repeatedly demanded.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Taiwan officials were studying China's response even as inaugural parties continued, and did not issue a statement. But independent experts were intrigued by the lack of expected belligerence and a tantalizing reference to conditions for possible negotiations over economic and other issues.</p>
        <p>''China's response was more moderate and gentle than we expected,'' said Yang Kai-huang, an expert on cross-strait relations at Soochow University. ''I think that China prefers to talk rather than go to war.''</p>
        <p>In a famous story in Chinese history, Mr. Yang said, you give your enemy a soft response as a test. If he does not pay you back with good will, then you have every justification to come back with force.</p>
        <p>''Maybe China is using this strategy,'' Mr. Yang said.</p>
        <p>The actual exchange is couched in the fine semantical distinctions over phrases like ''one China'' and ''two states'' that have taken on huge weight in the debate over Taiwan's future, but may appear to outsiders to be little more than wordplay.</p>
        <p>Beijing considers Taiwan to be a vital part of Chinese territory that was separated during the civil war that ended in 1949, when Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists fled to Taiwan. Mr. Chen, in his newly moderate stance that still leaves Beijing enraged, says Taiwan does not need to declare independence because in practice it is already a sovereign state.</p>
        <p>In recent months, ratcheting up the pressure, Beijing has said that indefinite delay in progress toward reunifying Taiwan with the motherland could be cause for war. They have lambasted Mr. Chen, who was elected in March, for failing to adopt ''one China'' as a starting point in future relations.</p>
        <p>At the same time, China says it can grant Taiwan exceptional autonomy, greater than Hong Kong's, if it will only accept the notion of unity.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Chen, in a speech that was mainly devoted to domestic concerns and Taiwan's progress toward democracy, did not discuss reunification, but rather the need to build ''conditions for cooperation through good will.''</p>
        <p>He also said, in an ambiguous statement that, given his background, seemed to be half an olive branch, ''We believe that the leaders on both sides possess enough wisdom and creativity to jointly deal with the question of a future 'one China.' ''</p>
        <p>Beijing, in an unusually quick response, predictably called Mr. Chen ''insincere'' on the central issue of unity. The statement, issued by the Communist Party Central Committee and the government's Taiwan Affairs Office, said, ''The new leader adopted an evasive and ambiguous attitude.''</p>
        <p>''Since the new leader of the Taiwan authorities expressed that he would not go in for 'Taiwan independence,' he should have attached no condition to it,'' said the statement, carried by the New China News Agency. ''Still less should he have refuted the reality that there is but one China and that Taiwan is part of China by saying that one China is something in the 'future.' ''</p>
        <p>But compared with recent threats, the statement seemed mild. Even more intriguing was the discussion of specific conditions under which negotiations between the mainland and Taiwan might begin. Mr. Chen, during his campaign for the presidency, said he was ready to talk about relaxing restrictions on direct transportation, commerce and communications across the Taiwan Strait -- something that Beijing has long sought.</p>
        <p>The statement today said that the suspended negotiations between a Chinese semi-governmental group, the Association for Relations Across the Strait, and a Taiwanese counterpart could begin again if the two sides ''will express in their own way orally that both sides across the strait stick to the 'one China' principle,'' as China says the two sides did in 1992.</p>
        <p>Beijing and Taipei differ in their explanation of what exactly was agreed to on the meaning of ''one China'' back then, but in 1992, they were able to set the issue down long enough to hold meetings and consider more practical issues.</p>
        <p>A second condition for new talks laid down by Beijing was that ''the Taiwan authorities make a clear-cut commitment that they will not advocate the 'two-states theory.' ''</p>
        <p>This refers to the statement last year by outgoing President Lee Teng-hui that Taiwan and China enjoyed a ''special state-to-state'' relationship, rather that one of a locality to the center. The words caused a crisis and led China to end all negotiations with Taiwan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chen's security officials have already said that they do not intend to use the offending phrase, but add that it merely described reality. So, depending on how much China wants to talk, this condition could be declared as met or not.</p>
        <p>It remains doubtful that Mr. Chen can agree, right now, even to an oral statement that there is only ''one China,'' many experts believe. Before he can make any bold moves on policy toward the mainland, Mr. Chen needs to build more of a consensus in his party and the society, said Bau Tzong-ho, a political scientist at National Taiwan University.</p>
        <p>So the more tempered statement from Beijing today may not be a breakthrough, these experts said.  But it may force Taiwan to weigh anew how far it can bend its own ideal in order to keep China talking rather than shooting.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Chen's words on cross-strait issues today were designed to avoid provocation, the entire speech carried a subtext that could not please leaders in Beijing.</p>
        <p>Ninety percent of his talk was not devoted to the confrontation with the mainland but rather the state of Taiwan's hard-won democracy, the need to root out corruption, economic and environmental goals, and devotion to human rights.</p>
        <p>The speech ended with Mr. Chen shouting out two slogans: ''Long Live freedom and democracy! Long live the people of Taiwan.''</p>
        <p>In short, noted Andrew Yang, who heads a defense research institute here, ''The speech carried heavy symbolism that Taiwan is an independent country already.''</p>
