        <p>A ROOM with a view, a dining room that is, can be especially inviting in summertime and when the view is of water, be it Long Island Sound, a river, lake, pond, waterfall or even a marina.</p>
        <p>Connecticut diners are blessed with a wide range of dining-out choices that include all the above. The following are a few personal favorites where good -- in some cases excellent -- food is augmented by summery water views that allow diners to revel in the joys of nature (without worrying about poison ivy or tick bites). Reservations are recommended at all the places listed and all accept credit cards unless otherwise stated.</p>
        <p>At GELSTON HOUSE RIVER GRILL in East Haddam (8 Main Street; 860-873-1411), the view is half the pleasure. Perched on a hilltop above the Connecticut River, the restaurant, ensconced in a handsome 19th-century Italianate Victorian inn, has enormous windows offering wide-angled views of the bridge and all the river action: cruise boats, sailboats and canoes gliding along. The spacious, comfortable dining room has a modern American menu, featuring seafood dishes such as Chilean sea bass, pappardelle and sea scallops with morel and porcini creme and almond-crusted Norwegian salmon, along with caramelized duck breast, rosemary-scented chicken breast and grilled fillet of rib-eye with Gorgonzola garlic butter. An added pleasure is that next door is the Goodspeed Opera House (which owns Gelston House), whose clever musicals make for a delightful outing. (The Gelston House also has six guest rooms.)</p>
        <p>You can't get much closer to the water than at PARADISE BAR AND GRILLE in Stamford (78 Southfield Avenue; 323-1116), which fronts on the marina at Stamford Landing. From the deck and large open dining room you can watch the traffic steering up and down the west branch of Stamford harbor, heading to and from Long Island Sound, while nibbling on appetizers like Annabel's steamers, smoked salmon, sushi rolls, Bass ale-battered shrimp or smoked rainbow trout. Among entrees are shrimp St. Lucia (garlicky sauteed shrimp over sun-dried tomato ravioli with a Gorgonzola tomato sauce), Honolulu salmon (grilled with Hawaiian pineapple), and the Tahiti trio (a pizza with sweet sausage, roasted peppers, artichoke hearts, sauce and mozzarella). A special Sunday brunch runs from noon to 4 p.m.</p>
        <p>On the waterfront is the SPLASH PACIFIC RIM GRILL in Westport (260 South Compo Road; 203-454-7798), on the grassy grounds of the Inn at Longshore, a town-owned, open-to-the-public country club edging the water. The area to lunch or dine at Splash is on the umbrella-protected deck facing Saugatuck Bay and a quiet beach. Not only is the open-air setting pretty, but also possible is conversation. Inside, the dining room noise is absolutely deafening. Splash, one of the first fusion-style restaurants in Connecticut, can be memorable for its seaside proximity as well as for the quality and creativity of its food, imaginatively prepared Asian, New American and Hawaiian dishes. Special indulgences might be starters like tempura sweet shrimp salad (with mizuna greens and spicy lemon vinaigrette) or crispy calamari salad with hot chili, lime and miso, followed by entrees like macadamia-crusted swordfish (with crispy spinach, ginger and lime sauce), citrus-glazed salmon (with baby bok choy and sweet almond rice) or grilled Shanghai beef (with sweet soy, cilantro, ginger and red chilies). There is an elaborate Sunday brunch buffet from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at $25 ($12.50 a child). Seating on the deck at Splash is first-come, first-served, so early is the best policy, whether at brunch, lunch or dinner.</p>
        <p>On the unpretentious side, but immensely popular for its fresh, simply prepared seafood, is the RESTAURANT AT ROWAYTON SEAFOOD in Rowayton (89 Rowayton Avenue; 203-866-4488). It is in a tiny house with minuscule deck facing Cavanaugh's Marina in Five Mile River, which spills into the Sound. Watching the Boston whalers, motorboats and high-powered sportsfishermen maneuver their way to and from the Sound, with seagulls swooping and cackling overhead, can be fascinating. The restaurant's quarters are tight and the staff maneuvers carefully, carrying orders of fried oysters and Ipswich clams, crabcakes, steamers, and all kinds of daily fresh fish specials. The tiny place, which has a surprisingly extensive wine list, is open for lunch and dinner as well as Saturday and Sunday for lunch.</p>
        <p>Also on the simple side but packing a visual wallop is BOOM, in Stonington (194 Water Street; 860-535-2588). This modest restaurant faces the Dodson Marina in Stonington Harbor, with a heads-on view of the comings and goings -- boatsmen docking their trawlers, power boats and sloops as well as terns, gulls and other sea birds roosting on the posts. The menu is a short one, as befits a casual place, but many dishes have a creative twist; among these are the scallops enlivened by roasted red pepper curry and jasmine rice), lightly battered oysters with chipotle aioli and native flounder with lumpmeat crab, cream sauce, sauteed spinach and plum tomato orzo. There are a few non-marine offerings, among them thyme-crusted pork tenderloin, New York sirloin with house-made hoisin sauce and sweet potato ravioli with grilled chicken and sage cream, along with daily specials, depending on the local catch of the day. Key lime pie and chocolate truffle cake are tops among several notable desserts. Boom is open daily except Monday, with Sunday brunch a popular time to relax on the waterfront.</p>
        <p>Inland Connecticut has its own charms, and prime among them for summer dining with a water view is Lake Waramaug at New Preston, a serenely tranquil lake not widely known outside its part of the state.</p>
        <p>A longtime local favorite is DOC'S (62 Flirtation Avenue; 860-868-9415), a modest, inexpensive pizza-plus place across the road from the lake. Doc's has had its openings and closings, but is now open full time, with an Italian menu that includes pizzas, pastas, calzones, seafood dishes like zuppa di pesce and shrimp and mussels fra diavolo and other entrees such as chicken with roasted red peppers and brown sauce, and veal Marsala. Doc's serves no alcohol, accepts no credit cards and is closed Mondays.</p>
        <p>For fancier dining, Lake Waramaug boasts three lovely country inns on hillsides overlooking the lake.</p>
        <p>I would be hard put to choose among them, but admit to being partial to THE BIRCHES INN (233 West Shore Road; 860-868-1735), which offers dining on a deck and a creative menu, the work of the chef-owner Frederic Faveau, with such treats as roasted garlic custard and ahi tuna with Savoy cabbage egg roll, both starters, and entrees of grilled leg of lamb with Parmesan polenta, grilled pork loin with duck confit, and Chilean sea bass with a seaweed-coriander crust. The inn is open only for dinner, beginning at 5:30 p.m. (early enough for full frontal lawn-and-lake views while dining) and is closed Tuesdays.</p>
        <p>The venerable HOPKINS INN (Hopkins Road; 860-868-7295) is an 1847 farmhouse with an expansive flagstone terrace, shaded by a mammoth horse chestnut tree. The terrace overlooks the lake, and the menu, reflecting the chef-owner Franz Schober's roots, features many Swiss and Viennese specialties, such as chicken with lingonberries, veal a la Suisse and veal in a paprika-sour cream sauce. Desserts are classics: Grand Marnier souffle glace, strawberries Romanoff, peach Melba, pear Helene. The inn is open for lunch and dinner daily except Monday when it is closed. Sundays it is dinner all day, from 12:30 to 8:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>The third hostelry, THE BOULDERS INN (Route 45; 860-868-0541), serves dinner only indoors (though by late June, lunch may also be available) as well as on the three-tiered terrace with overviews of the lake. Sheltered by giant maple trees, diners can enjoy a sophisticated menu that might include as appetizers sweet potato gnocchi with caramelized onions, Swiss chard, sun-dried cranberries and grated, aged goat cheese or cinnamon-smoked quail with quail sausage, followed by grilled chicken breast filled with black truffles and a mushroom polenta cake, pan-roasted Long Island duck breast with cranberry-butternut squash bread pudding, or venison loin with currant and toasted walnut chutney. Devastating desserts include chocolate obsession with hazelnut ice cream and Bourbon chocolate sauce, chocolate phyllo and poached pear Napoleon and pumpkin bread pudding with maple cream and maple crisps. Both Hopkins and Boulders inns have extensive, impressive wine lists.</p>
        <p>STONEHENGE in Ridgefield (Route 7; 203-438-6511) has long been known for its elegant French cuisine, but its Sunday brunch (from noon to 2 p.m.) is equally renowned. At brunch it is enjoyable to watch the ducks cavorting in their private pond, while savoring the $30 three-course prix-fixe meal that includes a glass of champagne and coffee or tea. Dinner is a la carte and features dishes like marinated salmon with fresh ginger, goat cheese and eggplant gateau and young leek terrine with lobster and beet vinaigrette. That's just for starters. Entrees include sauteed Dover sole meuniere, seared salmon tournedo and Roquefort-crusted black Angus steak. Stonehenge is open only for dinner and Sunday brunch.</p>
        <p>No round-up of summery water-friendly restaurants would be complete without mentioning SILVERMINE TAVERN, tucked into the woods in Norwalk (284 Silvermine Avenue; 203-847-4558). A vast sun-dappled deck that overhangs the Silvermine River, with swans and ducks skimming and splashing in the water below, makes the 200-year-old inn immensely popular in warm weather. The food plays second fiddle to the setting, but pecan-crusted brook trout, braised lamb shank and chicken pot pie are classics. The $19.50 prix-fixe Sunday brunch buffet and $17.95 Thursday evening buffet are bargains.</p>
        <p>Sipping, nibbling, dozing in the sunshine, these are the perquisites of lunch or dinner along the lazy river. Fair warning: you can request a deck table when you reserve, but getting one is a matter of timing. The inn also has 11 guest rooms; the restaurant is closed Tuesdays.</p>
