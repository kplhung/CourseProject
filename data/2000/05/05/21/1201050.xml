        <p>To the Editor: Like Geraldine Fabrikant, author of ''Relaxing Like a Celebrity'' (April 9), my husband and I felt trepidation about going to Parrot Cay in the Turks and Caicos, but hey, if it is good enough for a celebrity's honeymoon, it should be  good enough for us!</p>
        <p>Yes, our 45-minute ride from the dock to the hotel via boat, at night, was a thrilling way to enter this isolated and low-key resort. But from there it was all downhill.</p>

        <p>To the Editor: Like Geraldine Fabrikant, author of ''Relaxing Like a Celebrity'' (April 9), my husband and I felt trepidation about going to Parrot Cay in the Turks and Caicos, but hey, if it is good enough for a celebrity's honeymoon, it should be  good enough for us!</p>
        <p>Yes, our 45-minute ride from the dock to the hotel via boat, at night, was a thrilling way to enter this isolated and low-key resort. But from there it was all downhill.</p>
        <p>We were awakened at 6 a.m. by the three toddlers who had the room under ours. Our request for a room change, although honored, was now above a family with an infant. So much for children not being allowed. The large rooms were attractive, in spite of the mosquito coils, which were lighted every night. The deck, which we were told to avoid in early morning and early evening due to the ground spraying, offered a lovely view. Room service, served on the deck, arrived cold with items ordered missing. Although the staff tried hard to please, there seemed to be a language barrier.</p>
        <p>Snorkeling trips, by reservation, are only available once a day, and  can accommodate only four people. The massages, however, are first rate, and the yoga class has a terrific instructor. The unattended workout room was never crowded, perhaps because the air-conditioning was always on the blink.</p>

        <p>A spokeswoman for the Parrot Cay resort said it had not responded to a request for comment.</p>
