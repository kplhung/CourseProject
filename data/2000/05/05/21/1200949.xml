        <p>The Selling of</p>
        <p>''Free Trade''</p>
        <p>Nafta, Washington, and the Subversion</p>
        <p>of American Democracy.</p>
        <p>By John R. MacArthur.</p>
        <p>388 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Hill &amp; Wang. $25.</p>
        <p>You would have to go back to the 19th century to find a trade battle in Congress that was as divisive as that over the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993. What has been needed is a dispassionate study that gets past the sound and fury. John R. MacArthur's study, ''The Selling of 'Free Trade,' ''is not really that. It mixes a passionate attack on the treaty with a journalistic account of its passage and effects. Die-hard opponents of the agreement will probably like this book. Others may find it irritatingly one-sided.</p>
        <p>Nafta emerged from at least three different impulses: first, Mexican officials, frightened by a growing foreign debt that was crippling their economy, wanted to attract American investment; second, American businesses wanted to be able to invest in Mexico free from export restrictions and domestic content rules, and from the ultimate threat of expropriation; and third, American officials and policy makers, worried about political instability and a torrent of illegal immigrants, wanted to incorporate Mexico into a Common Market-type arrangement that would lead to the revival of its economy, the reform of its government and the reduction of cross-border tensions.</p>
        <p>MacArthur understands the first two impulses. He understands that Nafta was primarily an investment agreement rather than a free trade treaty. But he plays down or ignores Americans' broader concerns. Nafta, he insists, was ''entirely about money.''</p>
        <p>MacArthur, the president and publisher of Harper's Magazine, is at his best describing the lobbying that occurred after the treaty was signed and went to Congress in August 1993. He shows how business lobbyists worked hand in glove with the treaty's Congressional supporters. But he has surprisingly little to say about the negotiations themselves, or about the domestic political conflicts that occurred while the treaty was being negotiated. His account of these tends to render shades of gray as black. When the Bush administration proposed that Congress agree to a fast-track vote (up or down without amendments), Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader and a Democrat, backed Bush on the condition that the treaty contain rules on labor standards and environmental protection. MacArthur dismisses this position as nave and opportunistic. (Gephardt ''was presumably ambitious to be liked by the sort of people, honest or not, who can make you president.'')</p>
        <p>A year later, during the presidential campaign, Bill Clinton, under the influence of Gephardt and two advisers, Derek Shearer and Richard Rothstein, adopted the same position. MacArthur treats Clinton even more contemptuously than he does Gephardt. He says Clinton ''had already made up his mind on trade to the point where there was no substantial difference between his position and Bush's.'' Clinton's stand, he says, was primarily based on fund-raising. That assertion leaves little middle ground between those adamantly opposed to Nafta and those enthusiastically in favor. MacArthur may be right, but when I covered the negotiations I found otherwise.</p>
        <p>In the Nafta negotiations, Clinton and Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, earnestly attempted to get Mexico and Canada to agree to set up commissions that would have significant punitive powers. They failed, primarily because of Mexican and Canadian opposition, as well as opposition from the Business Roundtable and Republicans in Congress. But they also failed because the A.F.L.-C.I.O., instead of trying to work with the administration, took a position of unequivocal opposition to the treaty in any form. Clinton and Gephardt found themselves caught between business-style internationalism and labor protectionism.</p>
        <p>The resulting treaty was flawed. MacArthur's view, which also became Gephardt's, was that it should have been rejected, but MacArthur now criticizes Gephardt and John Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, for failing to press for Nafta's repeal on the grounds that it has worsened the condition of Mexican and American workers. In drawing this conclusion, MacArthur ignores two important considerations.</p>
        <p>He acknowledges that Mexico was in difficult straits on the eve of Nafta, but he attributes these problems to the Mexican government's abandonment of older high-tariff import substitution policies. Under these policies, MacArthur writes, there was ''less social inequality and more purchasing power for the average Mexican.'' But he fails to note that before the 1980's, the Mexican economy was propped up by oil earnings. When oil prices began to fall, the economy began to stagger, and it is still not on its feet. Nafta may not have improved Mexico's economy, but it is not clear that it has made things worse.</p>
        <p>The second consideration has to do with the impact of American investment in Mexico on American jobs. Investment increased somewhat after Nafta was signed, but the boom in American investment in Mexico predated Nafta. And if that investment had not gone to Mexico, it might have ended up in Central America or Asia, not in the United States. If Nafta depressed American wages, it did so indirectly -- by giving credibility to corporate managers' threats that if a union organized or demanded too much for its workers, the company would move to Mexico. Modifying Nafta to strengthen its labor and environmental commissions could benefit both American and Mexican workers, but repealing the treaty doesn't hold any obvious promise for Mexico, the United States or Canada.</p>
        <p>To MacArthur's credit, he has tried his best to make a potentially dull subject interesting by treating himself as a character in his narrative; by interspersing long interviews with lobbyists, politicians and affected workers; and by telling the story of one factory in New York that was affected by Nafta. But he is not the most artful author, and the book sometimes drags. It would have been much more lively at half the length. But it probably would not have been any more accurate a portrayal of the choices facing American policy makers and citizens in 1993.</p>
