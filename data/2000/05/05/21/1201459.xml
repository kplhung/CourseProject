        <p>Monica Seles is back in the Italian Open final, 10 years after her only victory in Rome launched her into tennis stardom.</p>
        <p>The hard-hitting left-hander looked like the Seles of old yesterday, hitting winners from both sides and giving no quarter in a 54-minute drubbing of unranked Corina Morariu.</p>
        <p>Seles's 6-3, 6-1 victory sets up a final against France's Amelie Mauresmo, who rolled over Fabiola Zuluaga of Colombia, 6-1, 6-2 in the other semifinal.</p>
        <p>But the story on Rome's red clay this week has been Seles, who has cranked up her game exactly a decade after she beat her idol, Martina Navratilova, to capture the 1990 Italian Open at the age of 16.</p>
        <p>Seles would followed that victory a month later with a French Open title, her first of eight Grand Slams in a 30-month stretch.</p>
        <p>''Ten years is a long time,'' Seles said after the match. ''It's been a fantastic time, lots of highs, lots of lows and lots of in-the-middle's. But in all that time I've never lost my love of the game.''</p>
        <p>The 26-year-old American still has a fearsome attack of two-handed forehands and backhands that can still decimate opponents.</p>
        <p>That was the Seles of yesterday. Without the mental lapses of her three-set quarterfinal victory, she wasted no time disposing of Morariu, an American ranked 43rd on the WTA tour with a reputation for inconsistency.</p>
        <p>''I just told myself before the match that if I win the first set, just to stay on top of her, and not let it get away like I did the last couple of matches,'' said Seles, who was pushed to three sets on Thursday and Friday.</p>
        <p>The 6-3, 6-1 victory was identical to the result of Seles's only previous meeting with Morariu, earlier this year at the clay-court tournament in Amelia Island.</p>
        <p>Seeded No. 5, Seles hit 17 winners, while Morariu committed 22 errors on the way to losing the final two games without a point. Seles will be playing in her fourth Italian Open final, having lost to Gabriela Sabatini in 1991 and 1992.</p>
        <p>Her opponent today will be 12th-seeded Mauresmo, who cruised past the tiring, unseeded Zuluaga.</p>
        <p>Mauresmo may offer a new hope for her countrymen heading into the French Open, having rolled into the finals of the Rome clay-court tournament while losing only one set.</p>
        <p>''It's good to play well from beginning to end in a tournament,'' she said, after her semifinal victory.</p>
        <p>KUERTEN AND SAFIN ADVANCE: Marat Safin beat the defending champion Marcelo Rios, 7-6 (8), 6-2, yesterday in Hamburg to set up a showdown with Gustavo Kuerten in the final of the German Open.</p>
        <p>Safin, the 12th-seeded Russian, saved three set points to win the tie breaker and used the momentum to race to a 3-0 lead in the second set. Rios never got back into the match.</p>
        <p>Kuerten reached his second Masters Series final in as many weeks when he beat Andrei Pavel, a qualifier from Romania, 6-3, 6-3.</p>
        <p>The lanky fifth-seeded Brazilian is gearing up for his favorite Grand Slam event, the French Open.</p>
        <p>The $2.95 million German Open is the fifth in the nine-tournament Masters Series, the most important events after the Slams. It is also a major tune-up for the French Open, which starts May 29.</p>
