        <p>Housing and Urban Development Department is endeavoring to shore up Section 8 program--national subsidy system that assists low-income people--by lowering subsidies to buildings and restructuring mortgages; many subsidized tenants in New York City buildings may face higher out-of-pocket rents; in strong market areas, such as Manhattan, some buildings may decide to leave program, forcing tenants to move to other subsidized housing; more than 11,000 apartments in city are under Section 8 program; photo (M)</p>

        <p>A METAPHOR helps to explain what the ''marking down to market'' program is all about, said the housing official. Then he launched into an elaborate one.</p>
        <p>Picture a fleet a ships floating gently down from Washington. Each one is a housing development, built with federal mortgage insurance under the Section 8 program, the name for a national subsidy system that assists low-income people.</p>
        <p>''Those that are listing we take out, and once we right them they go back into the HUD portfolio,'' said Patrick Eckman, who is acting director for the New York region of the Office of Multifamily Housing Assistance Restructuring, a branch of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. The office was created under the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997.</p>
        <p>The buildings that the act is designed to assist were built either new or as substantial rehabilitations from the late 70's to the mid-80's. They received insured mortgages running for 40 years, but the Section 8 subsidy contracts that supplement the rents that the tenants pay typically run for only 20 years.</p>
        <p>Many of these housing ships are listing because they are supporting high mortgages, which were required to get the housing built. In negotiating new contracts the government is seeking to make rents reflect market rents. In most cases this will mean reducing subsidies and lowering the building's mortgage burden. But it may also involve raising subsidies, HUD officials say. Eight applications from New York City buildings to ''mark up to market'' have already been received by the branch of HUD that handles them, the Office of Housing, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Under the Section 8 program, tenants pay 30 percent of their modest incomes as rent. The subsidy pays the additional amount required to make total rental income sufficient to meet operating expenses, local taxes and mortgage payments. The total authorized rent is called the contract rent.</p>
        <p>For example, the tenant might be paying $500 a month on an income of $18,000 a year. The contract rent might be $1,200 a month, with the government paying $700 to supplement the tenant's payment.</p>
        <p>The true market rent, however, might be $800 a month, not $1,200. HUD would therefore want to mark the contract rent down to $800. The tenant would still pay $500, but the subsidy would be $300 a month, not $700.</p>
        <p>The Government's fiscal stake is substantial. Its insurance portfolio has $12 billion in project-based Section 8 loans outstanding.</p>
        <p>The new contracts will also provide the money to pay for the major building improvements required after 20 years.</p>
        <p>With the signing of a contract in March by the housing company that owns a cluster of three buildings in East Harlem, the city now has an example of the mark-to-market program in action. The East Harlem contract was negotiated under a national demonstration that was set in motion before the permanent program went into effect, with the city's housing finance arm, the Housing Development Corporation, acting as HUD's agent. The demonstration reveals some of the issues that the permanent program faces.</p>
        <p>HOUSING professionals predict that most of the Section 8 buildings will  stay in the program. But in strong market areas, including Manhattan and some other city neighborhoods, others may decide to leave it. This would not deprive the low-income tenants in those buildings of access to subsidized apartments, though not necessarily in their own buildings.</p>
        <p>If a building leaves the Section 8 program, its tenants are assured of one more year of occupancy. If the tenant cannot afford the new market rent, and the owner will not accept voucher tenants, the tenant is eligible to participate in a HUD relocation program to move to another building that does take vouchers.</p>
        <p>The process of ''opting out'' of the Section 8 program would nevertheless diminish the total inventory of apartments reserved for low-income tenants. Vacated apartments would be reoccupied by tenants paying rents too high for low-income households.</p>
        <p>According to HUD, 448 projects in the city, with 111,300 apartments, are benefiting from project-based Section 8 subsidies. Staying in the program might lead to better, or at least more secure, economic results for the building than leaving it, housing professionals say, since an owner is assured of steady, adequate rent payments through any market cycle over 20 years, without the need to hunt in the private market for conventional financing that current tenant rents will probably not support.</p>
        <p>''We don't think that New York City properties will opt out,'' said Ira G. Peppercorn, director of the Office of Multifamily Housing Assistance Restructuring. ''We give something in exchange for rent reduction. We will restructure the mortgage if necessary and we will contribute 80 percent of the rehabilitation cost. If we do the job right, the owner will have no financial incentive to leave.''</p>
        <p>There are skeptics, however. Among them are the representatives of state housing agencies. They object to HUD's detailed 400-page rule book and the agency's one-size-fits-all compensation schedule, which they say has forced agencies in high-cost states and localities, including the city's Housing Development Corporation, out of the implementation process.</p>
        <p>''It was the clearly Congress's intent that state and local governments should be the restructuring agents, which would be the best way to preserve as much low-income housing as possible,'' said John B. McEvoy, executive director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies in Washington.</p>
        <p>OTHERS foresee problems in the law itself. Under the original Section 8 program, Congress committed the funds to fulfill the 20-year contracts up front -- in the first year. But under the permanent program enacted in 1997, the funds must be appropriated annually, subject to the terms of the 20-year contracts. ''Owners may figure they would be better off with vouchers rather than playing Congressional roulette every year,'' said David A. Smith, president of Recapitalization Advisors, a low-income housing consultant in Boston. They could abandon project-based subsidies but still accept voucher tenants, he noted.</p>
        <p>In addition, the new act requires owners to put up 20 percent of rehabilitation costs, and pay 50 percent of the substantial transaction costs in negotiating a new contract, without providing an incentive by which general partners can induce their investment partners to provide additional capital.</p>
        <p>''Even if I want to stay in the program, how do I finance it?'' asked J. David Page, a principal in Southport Financial Services of Tacoma, Wash., an owner-operator of 8,000 subsidized and market-rate apartments across the country. ''There's no compensation for the restructurer. How is he supposed to get it done -- and why?''</p>
        <p>Southport was the owner's consultant and also the provider of new capital in the mark-to-market demonstration in East Harlem. Now a partner in the ownership, it assisted in the negotiations with the Housing Development Corporation. The buildings are 1775 Houses, A. K. Houses and M. S. Houses, a total of 543 apartments on the west side of Lexington Avenue between 126th and 129th Street.</p>
        <p>The buildings are managed by Marion Scott Real Estate, a Manhattan firm that runs 15 Section 8 buildings in New York City and Newark. ''It's a difficult process,'' said David H. Berezin, a senior vice president of Marion Scott in charge of the East Harlem buildings. ''The demonstration program is certainly a lot easier for an owner to participate in than the permanent program appears to be at the present time.''</p>
        <p>Marking down to market in East Harlem meant a reduction of 23 percent in the contract rent, Mr. Berezin said, and the elimination of 27 percent of the mortgage debt. The repayment schedule for the balance due was strung out over 27 years. A $7 million rehabilitation is under way.</p>
        <p>''We now have the capital to replace all the buildings systems -- roofs, heating plants, windows, elevators,'' Mr. Berezin said. All the kitchens and appliances will also be upgraded. Tenants' rents will not be affected.</p>
        <p>But Herbert D. Freedman, a principal in Marion Scott, predicted that about 20 percent of the buildings that get project-based Section 8 subsidies in New York City would withdraw from the program. ''Any owner who has the option to get out of the program, because of the location of the property and its condition, undoubtedly will,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p>
        <p>One possible outcome in New York City, housing specialists say, is that neighborhood-based nonprofit companies may come forward to purchase Section 8 buildings from owners who want to leave the program. And further Congressional action is still possible to provide the tax or other incentives to make it easier for owners to sell to other entities, nonprofit or otherwise, that would keep the buildings as low-income housing.</p>
        <p>The Office of Multifamily Housing Assistance Restructuring itself expresses optimism. So far 33 projects in New York City have come forward to negotiate lower contract rents, said Mr. Eckman, the acting director of the regional office. ''We are happy with the level of participation so far,'' he said.</p>
