        <p>The annual ritual of asking what is right and wrong with the Tony Awards has arrived. Last year, some of the wrongs concerned the show: Radio City Music Hall was not available for the ceremonies; Rosie O'Donnell pulled out as the host, and the ratings and general telecast quality plummeted. This year, Ms. O'Donnell will be at her post -- at Radio City Music Hall -- on June 4. But concerns remain about the awards in general.</p>

        <p>The annual ritual of asking what is right and wrong with the Tony Awards has arrived. Last year, some of the wrongs concerned the show: Radio City Music Hall was not available for the ceremonies; Rosie O'Donnell pulled out as the host, and the ratings and general telecast quality plummeted. This year, Ms. O'Donnell will be at her post -- at Radio City Music Hall -- on June 4. But concerns remain about the awards in general.</p>
        <p>Here is a sampling of opinion from people working in the theater, compiled by Jesse McKinley.</p>
        <p>Roger Berlind  Producer</p>
        <p>Year after year, the Tony rules committee [a subcommittee of the Tony administration committee] meets to deal with the issues raised during the previous year. But there are always new things happening that you can't anticipate. I do think the revival category should be looked at again. The definition is a relic of the first Tonys. The cutoff point -- whether it has ever been done on Broadway -- is absurd. ''True West'' is a classic, a modern American classic, but it's not a new play.</p>
        <p>There is also, it seems to me, a need for some flexibility on the part of the Tony administration committee, a willingness to bring judgment to bear, rather than just following some of these archaic rules. Otherwise, there shouldn't be an administration committee. If there's nothing on the table, why are we sitting there?</p>
        <p>Gerald Schoenfeld  Chairman of the Shubert Organization</p>
        <p>The problem with the Tonys is that television does not see fit to support the arts and give them the extensive coverage they give to motion pictures. If they did, there would be a different attitude toward arts and culture in the country.</p>
        <p>If they could take tennis and golf out of the country clubs and give them mass appeal, imagine what they could do with arts and culture.</p>
        <p>George C. Wolfe  Producer, Joseph Papp Public Theater</p>
        <p>I have no problems with the Tonys this year, since we got the seven nominations [for the musical ''The Wild Party'']. But the awards show? It's tricky. I think it's such a precarious thing, because it's theater that is celebrating itself and being translated into another medium. The Oscars have the same problem: it's about the movies, but in the end it's a television show. Ultimately, I think television awards are the best awards shows. But that's no big news.</p>
        <p>There is also always a sense of having to try to legitimize the theater by having movie stars as presenters, which is fine, because many of them started in the theater. But you're still left with the central problem of having a live event, which theater is, on screen. How do you convey the immediacy and potency of theater? I really don't know.</p>
        <p>The best idea is to keep it as funny and irrelevant as possible. It's a great fun night when you win, a fabulous, fabulous night.</p>
        <p>Chase Mishkin  Producer</p>
        <p>I really don't take great exception to the Tonys. I think, actually, they are pretty well set up. The only area overlooked is best solo performances, particularly Dame Edna. Now, they gave us a special award and I'm thrilled, but that's a stunning thing Barry Humphries is doing. The truth is I might never have thought of it had I not had this guy who's not in a play and not in a musical, but is going out every night and the audiences love him. Overall, I think the Tonys do a very good job of maintaining the prestige. They do that by not having leaks about who wins and by having generally informed and qualified voters. Basically, I think the Tonys are great. But with four and a half shows, it's hard not to get excited.</p>
        <p>Robert Falls  Director</p>
        <p>Nothing's perfect, and it's always nice when you get an award from anyone: the Chamber of Commerce, Tonys, the Oscars.</p>
        <p>The Tonys are hard to criticize because they are so innately flawed, tied as they are to a political structure. And so every year they make egregious mistakes and every year make beautiful decisions.</p>
        <p>I do think, however, that there is a rigidity about this that should be opened up a little bit. Musicals especially are changing. So the categories either have to expand or new ones need to be created.</p>
        <p>I think the British, with the Olivier, do it better, with categories like ''outstanding entertainment.'' But I think as Americans we don't want special categories. We want ''The Best!'' We don't like variations from the theme: the biggest steak! The best play!</p>
        <p>One recognizes that the concept of awards is a lovely, silly thing. You like 'em when you get 'em, but in the long run, you've still got to get up and do your work.</p>
        <p>Bernard Gersten  Executive producer, Lincoln Center Theater</p>
        <p>I think the Tonys is a process, like life and art and the theater. It keeps going. The idea that some remedy might be found for the ebbs and the flows of opinion about a body of work seems as likely as finding a solution to politics. Problems don't get solved, they get reconsidered and recast. And the Tonys get recast, year in, year out.</p>
        <p>I do think the categories have really held up. They are a distillation of the information up till now. And maybe next year, they'll say if nobody sings and nobody blows a horn it ain't a musical. Or maybe if people dance a lot to music that perhaps was composed for a different purpose but it manages to tell a coherent story, maybe that will automatically be considered a musical. We'll have to see.</p>
        <p>My beef this year is that people get nominated for two shows, so the nominations are self-defeating. I just wonder why a person who does excellent work in two shows, can't receive a single nomination so they can win, rather than the two nominations canceling each other out. It's like being punished for being good.</p>
        <p>David Stone  Producer</p>
        <p>Forget the issues about nominations and eligibility. It's the television broadcast that is so outrageous. Broadway has some of the best and funniest writers in the world. Yet the award show honoring Broadway cannot manage to write any entertaining and memorable introductions or banter.</p>
        <p>If CBS is unwilling to give us the time and budget to allow this show to have the class of a proper awards show -- meaning, let's say, not cutting to the news at 11 p.m. when the author of the best play walks up to the microphone -- then I would prefer that we go in the direction of the Golden Globes. At the very least, we would let everyone know that we don't just create ''important theater'' but also know how to create some fun.</p>
        <p>As a producer, though, the way the Tony rules are structured now is great, better than any other award for any other art form. We have at least a 50-50 chance of getting a nomination. There are four major categories with four nominees in each -- 16 nominated productions. Only about 30 to 35 productions open in a year. Pretty good odds, I'd say.</p>
        <p>Jon Robin Baitz  Playwright</p>
        <p>In a sort of diminishing pool, the Tonys are a marketing tool that crosses over into a reward-and-punishment scenario. And so it lacks grace. And everybody knows it lacks grace. It feels sort of like Politburo favors. And so do you allow that to coarsen your appreciation for artistry? No, absolutely not. But somehow you feel the presence of men in suits bartering.</p>
        <p>And one ultimately has to ask about the impact of Off Broadway on serious theater. I would like to think the Tonys could acknowledge plays like ''The Waverly Gallery'' for their contribution to the American theater. There has to be some way to do with the theater what politicians have not been able to do with politics, which is to make it credible and attractive in the eyes of the populace.</p>
        <p>And how do you do that without inciting to riot? Aside from taking out the men in suits, I don't know how. Maybe the realistic grown-up thing is not to expect anything but cheap pageantry and back-slapping: promotion, in a word, that keeps your shows running.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth I. McCann  Producer</p>
        <p>The main problem is rigidity. Let's face it, as theater evolves, nothing quite fits set definitions. Unless you have the fluidity for people to say, ''Yes, this is special and separate; yes, this is an ensemble,'' you are going to have problems.</p>
        <p>The only way to do it is to have people who are impartial, not producers, making the decisions. Then you don't get into silliness like, ''Why did you nominate this one and not that?'' The revival category is supposed to be about innovative revivals, not bringing back the same show that was here 10 years ago. What are we going to do, bring ''Cats'' back in a year and call it a revival?</p>
        <p>I think it's very, very difficult to include Off Broadway, but certainly we should -- and yet, for some reason, we can't.</p>
        <p>It all goes back to rigidity, fear of changing lest you be considered political. But really, guys: if the Catholic Church could figure out how to give Giuliani an annulment, surely we can figure out how to give out some more sensible awards.</p>
        <p>James C. Nicola  Artistic director, New York Theater Workshop</p>
        <p>I've devoted my life to the theater, that's my religion and my family, particularly the theater in New York. And if I look at it from that big high place, the Tonys in the future will need to do some clear thinking as to what is their purpose: is it a promotion tool, to excite people about theater, or is it a community celebrating excellence?</p>
        <p>In my opinion, to keep their vitality, they are going to have to broaden their focus and become more inclusive. They need to adapt to certain inevitable trends. There are long-running shows that take up Broadway theaters, and that means some shows have to go to Off Broadway. Perhaps there should be a category for that -- for shows that tried but couldn't get to Broadway.</p>
        <p>I remember when there was no category for best revival. In that sense they have made shifts and changes to reflect the world around them. I think they find it is harder and harder -- particularly in the category of new play -- to find enough to fill.</p>
        <p>Maybe the Tonys should be about what the best musical theater is in New York. For me, though, I wish it would become more about excellence and not make distinctions about whether something is above 14th Street or not.</p>
        <p>Nathan Lane  Actor and former Tony Awards host</p>
        <p>The Tonys are sort of like Christmas. You think, ''Oh boy, Christmas is coming!'' Then it gets there and you think, ''Oh, this is Christmas.''</p>
        <p>The problem with the Tonys is that there isn't much to nominate so they end up going: ''It's a lamp. No, it's a play. Nominate it! My Aunt Rifka, she's pretty funny. Nominate her!''</p>
        <p>Then they go to put on a show. Sometimes there are worthy people and occasionally the right people get the nominations. But every year there are these discussions. So maybe they should change a little bit. Society is changing -- same-sex marriage and all. We've got to bend the rules a little bit.</p>
        <p>The show itself is always going to have problems. But what are you going to do? Have an open bar? Lap dances during the less important categories?</p>
        <p>I think it's fine. Really, life is too short to worry about it.</p>
