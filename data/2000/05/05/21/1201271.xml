        <p>JUST before a wildfire burned their house -- and more than 200 other Los Alamos, N.M., homes -- to the ground last week, Dick and Judy Opsahl were told that they had a last chance to rescue what they could. Mr. Opsahl said they first grabbed ''a few treasures'' and a bit of clothing.</p>
        <p>''The next part,'' he added, ''was to be sure we got the hard drives.''</p>
        <p>Most of their financial lives, from tax records to rental payments, were on their computers, which were soon up and running again in their temporary home at the Cities of Gold Casino Hotel in nearby Pojoaque.</p>
        <p>Laina Katcher, in her rush to leave Los Alamos, did not think to bring the family computer, but she did pack her bills for the current month. ''Isn't that stupid?'' she asked in retrospect. ''Why would I want those?''</p>
        <p>Even during the trauma of catastrophe, though usually after paying heed to things with more sentimental value, people seem concerned about their financial responsibilities. Now that homes are often home offices or home-based businesses, too, many have more data to lose. People also now tend to carry more debt, which makes dealing with creditors and worrying about cash flow part of the daily routine.</p>
        <p>''There is more going on in the household than ever before,'' said Brent A. Neiser, director of collaborative programs at the National Endowment for Financial Education, a nonprofit group in Englewood, Colo.</p>
        <p>Corporate databases can reconstruct most financial documents, though the bureaucracy can be overwhelming. ''We're all financially networked with large institutions, not just community banks and credit unions where you can go down the street and ask, ''What's going on?' '' Mr. Neiser said.</p>
        <p>Soon after the devastation of Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Mr. Neiser's group began working on a way to provide financial guidance to disaster victims. Together with the Red Cross, it interviewed victims of previous floods, fires and earthquakes and found that many experienced the same financial obstacles. Some were as basic as not having change on hand for pay phones when residential lines were down. Others involved an added layer of misery, like unscrupulous contractors who show up immediately after a calamity to take advantage of homeowners still in shock.</p>
        <p>Guidelines were developed, and later revised in tandem with the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
        <p>Some seeming nightmares have a way of working out. Almost as soon as the Los Alamos post office closed down for a few days, for example, the Postal Service began unloading mail at a Red Cross shelter.</p>
        <p>Receiving, say, a Visa bill was important to the evacuees, said Jo Anne Jones, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Los Alamos. ''When they're in the shelter all day, they do worry about those things, simply because there is not much else they can do,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Most large insurance companies send claims adjusters to disaster sites, where they can write checks on the spot for people with immediate needs. These representatives often also wind up fielding general financial questions from their clients. ''I'm just basically telling them not to worry,'' said Gloria Brown, a Los Alamos claims adjuster for State Farm, who lost her own home of 26 years in the fire. The only document she brought with her in the evacuation was a birth certificate, but the last thing on her mind was getting a copy of her mutual fund statement, she said.</p>
        <p>''All I want to do is start all over again,'' Ms. Brown said.</p>
        <p>In some ways, coping with a communitywide disaster is easier than going it alone. ''The Rotary Clubs in Japan sent thousands of dollars to this area,'' said Richard Hardman, whose home and business were damaged in Northridge, Calif., earthquakes in 1994. ''Because it was so visible throughout the world, people kind of rallied around.''</p>
        <p>But whether the catastrophe involves one home or 200, there are many steps people can take to keep things from getting worse.</p>
        <p>Prompt phone calls, for example. Utility companies will usually stop billing a residence and switch the service to another location, waiving initial connection charges.</p>
        <p>Credit card companies usually monitor disaster situations and mark ZIP codes where homes have been destroyed, but a call from a card holder can only help. Steve Boyden, a spokesman for the big card issuer MBNA America Bank, said his company offered things like payment holidays and increased credit lines for emergency purchases.</p>
        <p>Filing insurance claims, and collecting the benefits, can be a daunting task. Some victims of previous disasters have said they took years to settle. Mr. Neiser recommends submitting claim forms quickly and alerting the insurer that the list of damages might be incomplete. If property records are destroyed, catalogs or classified ads can help establish a fair value for damaged or destroyed items. A real estate agent can provide escrow papers for the value of a home, the county assessor can provide property tax records, and contractors can determine the value of home improvements.</p>
        <p>The Small Business Administration offers loans to homeowners and renters in declared disaster areas as well as to small businesses. FEMA offers grants; local governments may help, too.</p>
        <p>The Internal Revenue Service will provide copies of prior tax returns and will allow certain deductions for casualty losses. The costs of documenting losses may also be deductible. Disaster victims may want to amend their previous year's tax returns to report current losses, to get a refund quicker. Filing deadlines may be extended.</p>
        <p>Though getting fresh copies of documents is usually possible, extracting information from a melted computer is not. Evacuating with a computer or backup disks that have been kept current, or having backup copies stored in remote locations, can be key. Some companies also offer ways to replicate a desktop environment through the Internet; these services -- sometimes free -- are essentially a means of storing back-up files on a server. Experts warn, however, that there still are privacy concerns.</p>
        <p>In the end, of course, the items that are most worth saving are not Quicken files or Social Security cards. For Ms. Brown, the State Farm adjuster, it was her jewelry, her Lladro porcelain figurines and photographs of her nine children and 18 grandchildren. ''We have a lot of photographs,'' she said, and no regrets at hauling them all.</p>
        <p>Tips for Getting Out of Harm's Way</p>
        <p>IF you suffer a personal-property disaster, there are many resources -- your bank, your town hall, your accountant, your employer, everyone you do business with -- to help reconstruct your records. But the job is a lot trickier if the whole town is stricken at once.</p>
        <p>Following are some precautions that can make recovery from a disaster easier, regardless of the circumstances:</p>
        <p>* Always keep some traveler's checks and cash, including change for pay-phone calls. Banks and their automated-teller machines, even if intact themselves, depend on power and phone lines that may be knocked out for days. Consider keeping some funds on deposit outside your area.</p>
        <p>* Conduct an annual household inventory. Photograph or videotape possessions, or jot down information in a notebook: include when and where you bought each item, what it cost, model and serial numbers. Don't forget mundane items like clothes and linens, whose replacement cost can add up.</p>
        <p>* Photograph the exterior of your home. Include landscaping -- that big tree out front may not be insurable, but it does increase the value of your property.</p>
        <p>* Prepare a portable ''evacuation box.'' In it, put your household inventory and maybe some cash, plus photocopies of deeds, wills, birth and marriage certificates, passports, insurance policies and so on. Don't forget often-overlooked records: copies of drug and eyeglass prescriptions, immunization records and recent backups of financial data files from your home computer. Negatives of irreplaceable personal photographs might go in, too.</p>
        <p>* Choose a safe-deposit box some distance from your home for storage of original and valuable documents. This reduces the chance that they will be lost in the same disaster that wrecks your house. One exception: your will, because your executor will need it before the box can be opened.</p>
        <p>Additional information is available from the Red Cross (www.redcross.org), the National Endowment for Financial Education (www.nefe.org) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (www.fema.gov).</p>
