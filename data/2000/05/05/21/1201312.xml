        <p>Three different varieties of specialty foods can be found in shops that opened this spring on the western side of Second Avenue between 22nd and 23rd Streets. They are part of a strip of remodeled stores in the base of the co-op building at 235 East 22nd Street.</p>
        <p>The French Butcher, at 383B Second Avenue, opened on May 6. It is owned by Arnaud Carre, former head butcher at Les Halles restaurant on Park Avenue South. The shop is decorated from floor to ceiling with French tiling and carries a wide selection of prepared meats, including veal scaloppine at $16.50 a pound and T-bone steak at $14.50. There are also many cheeses and condiments from France. ''We prepare meat the better way in France,'' said Mr. Carre, whose father, Maurice, also a butcher, taught him the trade in Brittany.</p>

        <p>A few doors away, at 387 Second Avenue, Bruno the King of Ravioli opened a new store in March. Bruno, with locations in Midtown, the Upper West Side and Chelsea, is known for fresh ravioli, made at  its factory in Hackensack, N.J. Customers can watch video monitors behind the counter to see pasta being made. Raviolis include 20-ounce containers of meat, $5.99, and pumpkin, $6.99.</p>
        <p>Tony Castagnazzi opened the Gramercy Fish Market at 383 Second Avenue on March 27. Fresh fish, including salmon fillet, $8.99 a pound, and large cooked shrimp, $18.99 a pound, are chosen every morning at the Fulton market.</p>
        <p>''I've been in the fish business since I was about 6,'' said Mr. Castagnazzi, a native of Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, who has worked as a seafood buyer at Balduccis's and a manager at Citarella. ''I kept complaining about my work, and my wife told me to shut up and start my own store, so that's what I did.''</p>
