        <p>If the China trade bill slips through Congress this week, as some supporters now expect, Sander M. Levin, a Democrat who has voted against all of President Clinton's major trade initiatives, will -- ironically -- take some credit for helping provide the margin of victory.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin won backing from House leaders late last week to amend the bill granting China permanent trade ties to establish a human rights and trade policy monitoring commission for China. Vote counters on both sides of the aisle said the proposal, co-sponsored by Doug Bereuter, a Nebraska Republican, has helped recruit perhaps two dozen undecided lawmakers into the pro-trade camp.</p>
        <p>China has called the proposed commission an interference in its internal affairs. The Republican leadership had been cool to the idea. Clinton administration officials had kept their distance. Labor unions and some human rights groups have called it weak.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Levin's proposal has proved crucial to Democrats, and a few Republicans, who have found it politically impossible to vote for trade deals in recent years because labor unions and consumer groups oppose them so strongly. If critics call it a fig leaf, supporters are hailing it as an innovative tool to keep political pressure on China even while granting it long-sought guaranteed trade access to the United States market.</p>
        <p>''I waited to see what he would come up with before I decided,'' said Diana L. DeGette, a Colorado Democrat who announced her support for the Clinton administration's top remaining legislative priority after Mr. Levin detailed the commission's structure on Friday. ''My constituents care a great deal about human rights and want to see something done on this front.''</p>
        <p>The idea was modeled on the Helsinki Commission, which inspected human rights conditions behind the Iron Curtail during the cold war. Mr. Levin envisions that Congress and the White House will appoint high-level commissioners, including members of Congress and distinguished outsiders, who could monitor conditions in China and report to both branches.</p>
        <p>Each year, the commission would issue a report recommending legislative or administrative steps that might help raise pressure on China to improve its human rights conditions, though it would not have the power to enforce its recommendations. The commission could study ways of turning up the heat on Beijing that are not inconsistent with the World Trade Organization, including some kinds of sanctions and United States policy toward loans from international aid agencies.</p>
        <p>A second part of the Levin-Bereuter proposal enacts into law provisions that would help the United States fight sudden surges of imports from China. Both provisions won backing from the Republican leadership last week, which agreed to include them as part of the bill that would grant China permanent trade status. A vote in the House is expected to take place Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin represents a heavily unionized district of Michigan. With unions increasingly wary of trade deals that open markets and threaten industrial jobs, he has not met many trade agreements he likes. He voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994.</p>
        <p>He said he decided late last year to find an alternative to a straight vote on China's trade status. He said he wanted to ''reshape globalization'' so that trade deals would promote human values, not just the free shipments of goods.</p>
        <p>''It seems to me that trade and globalization can be forces for good, and we can't stop them,'' Mr. Levin said. ''But we have to shape them. In China's case, you can't just vote yes and trust that social and economic changes will come along together.''</p>
        <p>Labor unions and consumer groups have criticized the proposal as ineffective.</p>
        <p>''It's a well-meaning effort,'' said Thea Lee, a senior official at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and an outspoken opponent of the China trade bill. ''But it's redundant with what's already done and may even be counterproductive.''</p>
        <p>Some human rights groups are less dismissive, though many say that the Levin commission could be much stronger if it had the power to force a Congressional vote on its recommendations each year.</p>
        <p>''It could be stronger, and we think that there's a chance it will be stronger before this is finished,'' said Mike Jendrzejczyk of Human Rights Watch in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jendrzejczyk said the Helsinki Commission had real influence on Soviet bloc nations, but that China, unlike the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, had not signed a treaty permitting review and inspection of human rights.</p>
