        <p>BELLINI  ++  (212) 308-0830; 208 East 52nd Street, between Second and Third Avenues; $$; smoking at the bar and in smoking section; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>The airy walls and tile floors are attractive here. And more important, the service is particularly thoughtful. Appetizers include baked littleneck clams with seasoned bread crumbs; lightly pan-fried mozzarella with an anchovy caper sauce; Atlantic grilled calamari with diced zucchini, eggplant and tomato; and escarole, sweet sausage and white bean soup. Main dishes include breast of chicken dipped in egg batter, over a bed of spinach; veal scaloppine topped with eggplant, prosciutto and mozzarella in a tomato sauce; and monkfish sauteed in light tomato sauce, garlic, fresh herbs and shiitake mushrooms.

        <p>BRASSERIE  ** [Rating: Two Star]  (212) 751-4840; 100 East 53rd Street, at Lexington Avenue; $$$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Patrons of the old Brasserie enter, and their jaws drop. You still descend a staircase to reach the famous downstairs dining room, but there's a new glamour to the place, which has been given a very expensive face lift. Appetizers include crab cake; tuna tartare; escargots petit gris; and foie gras au torchon. Entrees include duck cassoulet; Chilean sea bass with lemon grass and lime; roasted chicken, thyme jus and truffled mashed potatoes; and rigatoni with cherry tomatoes, garlic, broccoli rape and aged parmesan. Desserts include chocolate beignets with caramel ice cream; chocolate mousse and peanut ganache with chocolate ice cream; and mixed berries with grapefruit sorbet. (Review: 3/15/00)</p>
        <p>NICHOLSON  ++  (212) 355-6769; 323 East 58th Street, between First and Second Avenues; $$$; smoking at the bar and lounge; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>With its parquet floors, painted wall tiles and antique settees, Nicholson feels like a room in a remote corner of a sprawling chateau. There are three tasting menus of four, six and eight courses. The four-course menu features oysters in a shallot jelly; white asparagus and caviar napoleon; civet of cod with pistachio and a light bearnaise sauce, or loin of lamb with a yellow squash flan and a nero sauce; and almond sorbet. The six-course menu features coq of lobster with assorted caviar; endive salad with Asian pears, apple chips, mustard and chive dressing; potato tart with house smoked salmon and caviar; squab salad dressed with white truffle oil; navarin of John Dory with a froth of fennel, or braised rabbit with daikon lasagne; and honey ice cream. The eight-course menu features sea scallops with a bright citrus topping; sweet and sour cherry tomato salad with basil vinaigrette; lamb carpaccio with a mint and basil glaze; scarlet croustillant of shrimp with a white truffle cream reduction; Belgian endive sauteed with cured goose liver; salmon-trout served with a chicory sabayon; fillet of pork with braised oxtail, galette potatoes, soubrises, onion and watercress puree or lobster souveroff en cocotte with chestnuts; and crystallized rose petals with a rose water granite. (Diner's Journal: 5/5/00)</p>
        <p>L'ACTUEL  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  (212) 583-0001; 145 East 50th Street, between Lexington and Third Avenues; $$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>L'Actuel is translated as ''right now,'' and the name means what it says. The restaurant is up to the minute in a very French way, but retains the essential qualities that define a brasserie. Starters include stuffed snails with garlic and butter; calamari, shrimp and heart of palm salad; white asparagus with three different hams and sauces; and duck foie gras stuffed with apricot and served with confit ginger. Entrees include seared pork filet mignon with red cabbage and calvados apples; roasted lobster with carrot spaghetti and a parsley sauce; roasted breast of chicken, vegetables tian with an herbed infusion sauce; and seared swordfish fillet with sweet corn and a green tea sauce. Desserts include  lightly caramelized mango cream on mango fruit salad; melon and raspberry in a muscat wine terrine, served with a melon sorbet and a mint sauce. (Review: 2/2/00)</p>
        <p>SONO  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  (212) 752-4411; 106 East 57th Street, at Lexington Avenue; $$$$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>There is a disarming simplicity to this idiosyncratic restaurant with a  persuasive blend of French and Japanese cooking. Blond wood and grilled ceiling panels suggest a latter-day teahouse. First courses include crab cakes, tomato essence and shiso; grilled shrimp with yuzu zest and cayenne; stir-fried frogs' legs with garlic sprouts and bean sprouts; and lobster ravioli with lobster-seaweed bouillon. Main courses include sauteed black bass with cherry blossom and vegetable consomme; grilled pompano with white miso and stir-fried Asian vegetables; sauteed veal with edamame crust and a carrot-ginger sauce; and roasted breast of duck and leg confit, steamed buckwheat and wasabi-watercress sauce. Desserts include strawberry panna cotta; chocolate-raspberry truffle cake; and a fruit soup of lemon grass broth with passion fruit sorbet. (Review: 12/22/99)</p>
        <p>What the stars mean:</p>
