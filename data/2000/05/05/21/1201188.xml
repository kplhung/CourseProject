        <p>Gould Tribute</p>

        <p>Goodbye, Vic</p>
        <p>In his 53rd year as a performer, Vic Damone is finally calling it quits. Hence, ''A Farewell to Remember'' tour that comes to the Westbury Music Fair on Saturday.

        <p>Under the Big Top</p>
        <p>If it's May (and/or early June), the circus is coming to town. Specifically, the Big Apple Circus is coming to the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University. This year's edition, ''Bello &amp; Friends,'' pulls into Brookville on Friday to begin a 14-performance run through June 4.

(516) 299-3100.</p>
        <p>Car Crazy</p>

        <p>Bay Street Bows</p>
        <p>The Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor opens its season Wednesday with a hit import from London's West End, ''The Woman in Black -- A Ghost Play.'' Adapted by Stephen Mallatratt from the book by Susan Hill, the thriller stars the veteran stage and film actor Josef Sommer as a London solicitor who hires a professional actor, Jason Butler Harner, to help him re-enact and thereby exorcise the terrifying experiences of his youth. Directed by Leonard Foglia, the ''spine chiller'' runs through June 11 and will be followed by ''Hedda Gabler,'' June 21 through July 9; ''Love, Janis: The Songs, the Letters, the Soul of Janis Joplin,'' July 19 through Aug. 6, and ''You Can't Take It With You,'' Aug. 16 through Sept. 3 (631) 725-9500.</p>
        <p>Free Choices</p>
