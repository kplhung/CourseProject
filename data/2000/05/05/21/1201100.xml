        <p>A BLUE sign outside the mammoth industrial plant here on Marcus Avenue  still reads ''Lockheed Martin.'' But a new owner, i.park Lake Success, which bought the property from Lockheed in March for $21 million, has already begun demolishing interior partitions as a first step toward transforming the 1.4 million square feet into a sophisticated center for telecommunications and dot-com companies.</p>
        <p>Leasing through Cushman &amp; Wakefield of Long Island, a division of the national real estate brokerage company, has begun, and the first tenants are expected to move in by early fall. Annual rents of $23 to $25 a square foot include taxes and common-area charges, but not utilities, which will be separately metered. Tenants must take a minimum of 50,000 square feet, but incubator space for start-up companies is also planned.</p>
        <p>The availability of large blocks of space will allow companies whose operations are scattered in several locations to consolidate  under one roof and to have access to fiber optics and heavy-duty power supplies, said David C. Leviton, a senior director at Cushman &amp; Wakefield of Long Island. A single tenant is being sought for the three-story office building on Marcus Avenue that is connected to the plant, he said.</p>
        <p>Development of the Internet and of Internet service providers is creating opportunities for the redevelopment of industrial sites like the former Lockheed plant, said Lynne M. Ward, a vice president of i.park Holdings of Greenwich, Conn., one of the partners in  i.park Lake Success. The second partner in the Lake Success venture is the Apollo Real Estate Investment Fund IV of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''The defense companies in many ways have had their time, and the information companies have their time now, so we think this project is almost symbolic,'' Ms. Ward said. She estimated that the partnership's total investment in the Lake Success project would be $70 million, including the $21 million purchase price.</p>
        <p>The Apollo fund, which has $1.1 billion in assets and is one of a group of similar real estate funds, will provide 95 percent of the cost. I.park Holdings, which was formed by principals in National RE/sources of Greenwich, an experienced real estate developer, will be responsible for the remaining 5 percent. It will also handle the development, leasing and day-to-day operations of the project.</p>
        <p>The Lake Success complex occupies 93 acres stretching from Marcus Avenue south to the Union Turnpike Extension. Lakeville Road borders the property to the west. The site is notable for its history: The United Nations had its first home in the Marcus Avenue office building from 1946 to 1951.  Lockheed Martin was the last of a series of defense contractors to own the site, where a variety of navigation, radar and fire-control and surveillance systems were manufactured for almost 60 years. Just before it shut the plant in 1998, Lockheed was making navigation systems for Trident submarines.</p>
        <p>ALL the existing space will used for the new technology center except for some smaller buildings facing Union Turnpike, about 75,000 square feet in all, that will be demolished to expand the parking lots, which can currently accommodate  4,500 cars.</p>
        <p>The office building on Marcus Avenue has about 73,000 square feet on three floors, with 1.35 million square feet to the rear, most of it in a sprawling one-story industrial building. About 140,000 square feet is in a separate building, the former foundry.</p>
        <p>Because of its former manufacturing use, the property already has heavy-duty electric service. Tenants will be given a choice of multiple carriers, keeping prices competitive. Alternative electric power routes will be added to the building ''because these companies can't have their computers go down even for a second,'' Ms. Ward said.</p>
        <p>Mark A. Tsocanos, a principal in the Apollo investment group, said the i.park project  would provide a collaborative environment for the very technical telecom switching and Internet hosting services and the creative activities of Web site and software developers.</p>
        <p>The Long Island Technology Center in Great River, which opened about a year ago in a manufacturing plant once owned by Northrop Grumman, offers a similar concept: space devoted to high technology and occupied by tenants who can share ideas and create a synergy.</p>
        <p>But Great River is 50 miles from Midtown Manhattan, and Lake Success is only 16 miles away. In fact, the i.park project's location will allow employers to draw workers from the entire metropolitan area, said Richard J. Mack, another principal in the Apollo fund, and the proximity of La Guardia and Kennedy International Airports will help draw national and international companies.</p>
        <p>Interior demolition work has begun on a 350,000-square-foot portion of the main industrial building. With partitions ripped out, the 640-foot-by-220-foot area gives potential tenants an idea of what the space can offer.</p>
        <p>Steel supporting columns are spaced 40 feet apart in one direction and 80 feet in the other, allowing for very open floor plans.  The ceiling heights are 16 feet and 22 feet. The raised areas of the roof were originally designed to accommodate large vehicles and also to provide light monitors, the vertical skylights that suffuse the interior of the building with large amounts of natural light. The wood-block floors are being replaced with carpet over the existing concrete. Additional light flows in through two rows of  horizontal windows that extend along the exterior of the building. New partitions will be installed and interior renovations will be tailored to individual users.</p>
        <p>''A lot of industrial buildings like this are perfect for new office-space layouts because they have very tall ceilings and as in this case, very large spans between columns,'' said Michael M. Samuelian, a project designer and an associate at Hellmuth Obata &amp; Kassabaum, the Manhattan architectural firm that is handling the renovation.</p>
        <p>New entrances will be added to the main industrial building. The goal is to give each tenant its own front door and also to add architectural interest. The former plant is  1,440 feet long and 640 feet wide. The design of the new entrances will reflect the ''midcentury late Art Deco style of the former administration building,'' Mr. Samuelian  said.</p>
        <p>The new plans for the grounds, which Hellmuth Obata &amp; Kassabaum will also handle, include a new ring road with access points to each entrance. Existing trees will be saved and new trees will be planted along the ring road to form a boulevard. A small park of three to four acres will be created on the southern part of the site near Union Turnpike. The property also contains retention basins surrounded by a grove of trees, where some groundwater contamination is being cleaned up.</p>
        <p>''I think the developers of the i.park will be successful because technology is growing rapidly, not only on Long Island but also in New York City, where 25 percent of leases executed during the first quarter of 2000 were with dot-com companies,'' said Dr. Pearl M. Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association in Commack, a  nonprofit organization that represents some 5,000 businesses and civic groups.</p>
        <p>Many of New York City tenants are outgrowing their current spaces and are now facing annual rents of $30 to $40 a square foot, Dr. Kamer said. ''So the next step for a lot of these technology and new-media firms in Manhattan is to move into the outer boroughs, which is already occurring in Long Island City, and then into Long Island, where rents are 30 percent to 40 percent below those in Manhattan,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The federal government originally built the Lake Success plant. Sperry Gyroscope moved in as the first tenant in 1941. Ten years later, Sperry bought the property, later selling off 50 of its original 143 acres to an office developer. Sperry became the Sperry Rand Corporation, and in 1986, it merged with the Burroughs Corporation to form Unysis. In 1995, when the Loral Corporation bought the defense electronics division of Unysis, it became the property owner. Then Lockheed Martin acquired Loral in 1996.</p>
        <p>Lockheed shut down its Lake Success operation in 1998 as part of a plan to dispose of surplus properties that it owned around the country. Lockheed originally wanted to be its own developer and came up with a plan to demolish the buildings and to sell off the land for offices, a hotel, housing and retail development. But rezoning could have taken years.</p>
        <p>''We liked a lot of the Lockheed Martin plan because it offered a lot of opportunities to do a lot of different things,'' said May W. Newburger, the town supervisor of North Hempstead, where 50 of the site's 93 acres are situated. ''The i.park concept has the advantage of creating jobs without the upheaval of getting permits and site plan approvals,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ward of i.park Holdings said her company, in partnership with the Apollo investment group, hoped to complete similar speedy conversions from industrial to telecommunications space around the country.</p>
        <p>''We are looking for existing facilities that can be retrofitted because of the speed with which that can be done,'' she said. ''The opportunity is now. These companies need the space yesterday.''</p>
