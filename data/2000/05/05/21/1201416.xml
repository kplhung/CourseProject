        <p>The Senate defeated a measure to set a deadline for withdrawing American ground troops from Kosovo, averting a foreign policy setback for the Clinton administration. The Senate stripped a provision from a military spending bill that would have cut off funds for the 5,600 United States forces in Kosovo by July 1, 2001, unless Congress approved an extension. The White House said the measure would undermine the NATO operation in Kosovo.</p>
