        <p>On a sunny afternoon in the quiet den of her house in the Netherlands, Karin van Elswijk, a 40-year-old housewife and mother of three, enthusiastically re-enacts her captivity. She has pulled back her dark hair to highlight her striking green eyes, and if her glamour looks a bit studied -- the leather pants, leopard-print top and black suede boots -- it's because she has just returned from one of the many charitable events over which she now presides. ''After my last day inside the house, I couldn't eat for a week except for little bites,'' she says, fondly recalling the experience that made her a national celebrity in Holland. ''I was shaking terribly the whole time. The psychologist said it was a reaction to being locked up.''</p>
        <p>Millions of Dutch people would need no introduction to either this woman or her exploits; to her countrymen she is simply Karin. Last autumn, they closely monitored her confinement as part of a television series called ''Big Brother.'' Having seen her perform countless mundane tasks on that most entertaining program, they feel they know her intimately. She is frequently approached by people who want to touch her hair. Mail scribbled only with her first name and city of residence -- Karin, Apeldoorn''- is delivered without a hitch.</p>
        <p>Karin was selected last September to join in what TV producers at John de Mol Produkties called ''part social experiment, part real-life soap and part competition.'' She and eight strangers moved into a specially designed house rigged with 24 cameras and 59 microphones. For the next 100 days, not a single movement, word or gesture was shrouded from the public. With nightly broadcasts (and round-the-clock Internet feeds), viewers got a thrilling, vicarious taste of everyday life. In this unscripted Orwellian drama, the housemates played themselves and the audience played the State. Over the course of 114 broadcasts, shown six nights a week, the program attracted huge ratings; the finale pulled in 53.6 percent of the viewing audience. ''On that last amazing night,'' a fan told me, ''the streets were deserted!'' Holland had pitched voyeurism to a new level.</p>
        <p>''One thing that was very embarrassing under the cameras was getting undressed,'' Karin loudly confides. ''I'll show you how I kept my dignity.'' Though she is no exhibitionist -- far from it! -- she cannot restrain herself from acting out her defiance. Like everyone who has ever surrendered to cameras, she's proud of the way she eluded them.</p>
        <p>After a few pantomime nods, Karin steps into a corner of the room, with her face aimed straight into the V,</p>
        <p>and presses against the dark wood of the walls so aggressively that she seems on the verge of cracking something. ''I stayed like this,'' she says to the wood, moving her fists up and down in a series of pretend-undress motions. ''So the camera above me could record nothing -- and the one across the room was at its maximum distance.</p>
        <p>''The greatest thing was coming out of the house at the end,'' she adds. ''In a strange way I still could feel the cameras, but to take that first shower and not have to cover my face? Marvelous. Like in dreams!''</p>
        <p>Until recently, so-called reality entertainment was made up of flashy highlights edited from unstaged events. Mainstays of the genre included police chases, toddlers rescued from floodwaters and animals gone berserk. But mere excerpts didn't go far enough. The new obsession in TV (and on the Internet) is with capturing the rhythms of ordinary life -- or, at least, the kinds of intimate human interactions that have previously eluded the camera's gaze. A pioneer of this genre is MTV's ''Real World,'' now entering its ninth season, which places a group of roommates under videotaped surveillance for four months. (The show was conceived as a jump-cut variation on ''An American Family,'' the 1973 PBS documentary series that recorded 12 weeks in the life of the Loud family.) As oppressive as the ''Real World'' concept sounds, the show provides its subjects any number of exits and hiding places: the two camera crews that work the house bend heliotropically toward the topic of the moment and vacate the premises entirely for four hours a day. All in all, MTV seems to envision daily life as an endless game of pool in which people antagonize each other, then storm off to points unknown. But the latest breed of reality entertainment allows virtually no escape.</p>
        <p>''Survivor,'' set to premiere May 31 on CBS, centers on a group of contestants deliberately stranded on a Malaysian island to see what kind of TV would result: who would mate, who would fight. Despite the contrivance of the show, its creators insist that they're selling a glimpse of raw human reality. ''The behavior we saw was genuine, I'm absolutely certain of it,'' says Mark Burnett, the show's executive producer. ''Within minutes, people were having the sort of arguments you'd never see in a restaurant with 25 people watching, let alone millions. They either forgot the cameras were rolling or they didn't care.''</p>
        <p>Even PBS is staking out its corner of the reality craze. In June, the network will broadcast the English series ''The 1900 House,'' in which an average family must endure three months of day-to-day living in a Victorian house without such luxuries as indoor plumbing or electricity. Mercifully, no one is denied the simple comfort of being surrounded by cameras all the time.</p>
        <p>The most ambitious reality-based show is the American version of ''Big Brother,'' which begins its three-month run on CBS in July. The premise has changed very little from its debut in Holland (or versions that are now running in Germany and Spain): 10 people who have never met move into a house and live under what is rightly described as total surveillance. In the American incarnation, thanks to a few sly modifications, the housemates will live among 28 cameras and 60 microphones. There will be no dead zones. Housemates will not be able to harbor any secrets -- not in a pitch-dark room, nor even the bathroom. Anyone who tries to bend the rules will be rebuked by Big Brother himself, a stern voice that blares out of speakers installed throughout the house.</p>
        <p>Each contestant is allowed to bring one suitcase of clothes and another case, scarcely larger than an attache, for books and other diversions they might want over the next three months. There is to be no mail and no media. Food and medicine will be delivered through a two-door chute that eliminates any possibility of contact with the outside. Housemates will bake their own bread, grow vegetables and generally live as best they can with their new family. They are not trapped, of course. This is not Lubyanka. Housemates may leave at any time. ''But the door only swings out,'' the CBS rules warn. ''If a participant elects to leave the house, there is no return.''</p>
        <p>Still, in this odd imitation of life, some housemates who dearly want to stay will be kicked out, for ''Big Brother'' is partly a contest. Every two weeks, through a telephone voting process, the viewing public ejects one contestant from the house. Whoever is left standing at the end -- the person who neither cracks under the scrutiny nor is vetoed by the fans -- receives a $500,000 prize.</p>
        <p>Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television, hopes that his reality shows will deliver top ratings. But what he seems to love best is the genre's volatility. ''Big Brother'' is an unknown drama, a novel whose narrative arc and character development cannot be predicted by anyone, least of all its authors. ''Casting the people for 'Survivor' was as much fun as I've ever had -- and it'll be the same with 'Big Brother,''' Moonves says. ''You get the chance to speculate about whether, say, these two people here will have conflict. Or that this girl and this guy might get together. Sometimes you're right, and sometimes you're so far off you can't even imagine.''</p>
        <p>''Survivor'' generated some early notoriety for the new reality media with an unwanted plot twist. On its maiden run (as the Swedish series ''Expedition Robinson''), the very first man to be voted out of his TV tribe expressed his dismay by hurling himself in front of a train. CBS is trying to let a little grass grow over the incident. ''Evidently, the guy was very unstable,'' Moonves says rather breezily, ''in ways that couldn't really have been foreseen.''</p>
        <p>For the American version of ''Big Brother,'' the network has decided not to discontinue the elimination process. Still, in the wake of the suicide, psychological testing of contestants has become something of an obsession. The entry forms for ''Big Brother'' read like a secret history of all the reality-based TV that has gone before. (The application deadline passed nine days ago.) One question echoes Fox's multimillionaire-groom scandal: ''Have you ever had a restraining order issued against you?'' Other questions try to separate the players from the prudes: ''Have you ever been to a nude beach? If so, what was it like?''</p>
        <p>Distinct from anything imagined by Orwell, participants of this series don't end up loving Big Brother; that's where they start. The inevitable comparisons to the movie ''The Truman Show'' collapse when you realize that these people are racing to get inside the bubble. Their privacy is not so much surrendered as shunned. Applicants are now traveling -- at their own expense -- to CBS ''interview locations'' in 16 cities, all in the hope that they may be chosen to have their darkest flaws exposed to a grateful nation.</p>
        <p>The success of ''Big Brother'' in Holland was largely due to the fact that it was not pure TV. It was arguably the first grand-scale confluence of television and Internet entertainment. Viewers who wanted to watch the housemates in real time and without the distortions of editing could log onto the show's Web site at any hour, day or night, and click on one of four ''video streams.'' (The Web site for the American version will have the same setup.) The Dutch site eventually racked up 52 million page views, nearly 10 times the producers' initial estimates.</p>
        <p>That number only accounts for the official ''Big Brother'' site. At one point, there were 40 Web sites devoted to Karin alone; fans were so starved for fresh information that a computer hacker pirated the audio feed from the house and broadcast it online. ''You could hear the noises I made when I was brushing my teeth,'' Karin says, not unimpressed. ''People thought it was important!''</p>
        <p>Of course, television alone could never sustain (or afford) such unblinking focus on the banal. But the Internet is wall to wall. Everything is presented at the same emotional pitch: sex, supper, conspiracy and sleep are given equal weight. Household chores become breaking news.</p>
        <p>On the Web, you can watch pedestrians shuffle through Times Square or Red Square, take in the morning bustle of a Parisian hotel lobby, spy on fruit bats at the Smithsonian or gawk at a burly man kneading dough at Mandee's Pizza in Beverly, Mass. You can stare out the exact window in Dealey Plaza from which Lee Harvey Oswald is believed to have shot J.F.K. Or you can sit, long after midnight, as I have, watching people read and eat toast. You can watch people watch TV.</p>
        <p>Cheap Internet cameras, or ''Webcams,'' are becoming ever more commonplace. Roughly a million of the devices were sold last year. According to Brian Cury, founder of the EarthCam network of Internet cameras, there are more than 10,000 live cameras now transmitting continuously from points around the globe. ''As for personal Webcams,'' he says, ''there are probably another quarter-million people out there who are exposing their lives parttime.''</p>
        <p>The Net's influence is not taken lightly by TV programmers. ''The integration of the Internet into 'Big Brother' was crucial,'' says Paul Romer, one of the program's creators and also an executive producer of the American version. ''Both in Holland and the U.S., we're getting used to a different idea of privacy. There are cameras in fuel stations, shopping malls, everywhere. People behave normally in these settings. But there is nowhere on TV to see that. 'Big Brother' is really a Webcam show, on television.''</p>
        <p>As TV and the Net enlist more and more people to reveal themselves, the formerly unsavory phenomenon known as exhibitionism is being redefined. It's being rehabilitated as an adventure. Exposure to media scrutiny -- so the theory goes -- is like being exposed to the elements. Only, the elements here are sight and sound, the heat of klieg lights instead of the sting of wind. We are asked to believe that this century's first explorers, our Scotts and Amundsens, are those who can withstand the pressures of the lens. ''Big Brother'' housemates travel down an Amazon of the self, unafraid to wash or weep (and not forgetting, please, to undress) in front of millions of strangers. And adversity, as everybody knows, breeds heroes.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the shifting definition of fame has been leading up to this. Accidental celebrities (White House secretaries, injured royal bodyguards and the like) have become a permanent feature of the news and are openly admired for their toughness under the lights. Seeing them battered by the strobe of the paparazzi, the public understands that scrutiny is not far from brutality. Whether the victim is willing or not, well, it hardly matters. Those dragged into the limelight are pitied for being there; those who claw their way into the limelight are pitied for being the kind of people who want to be there. Either way, being placed on exhibition -- and coming through it intact -- has come to be seen as a perverse achievement. ''What makes it a journey is that everything is unexpected,'' says Romer. ''You know what the goal is, as surely as if it's the North Pole, but you never know what you'll find en route. It's an expedition -- an expedition of the mind.''</p>
        <p>The American ''Big Brother'' house is being constructed in Los Angeles on a CBS Studio Center lot, just across from where ''Gilligan's Island'' was filmed. This fact is not yet widely appreciated. But anyone in Holland can tell you how to find their ''Big Brother'' house. It's on the back lot of a studio in Almere, half an hour east of Amsterdam, and only a few yards away from a peculiar artificial neighborhood where a hit series called ''Flodder'' was made.</p>
        <p>The Dutch house is flat, like a Manhattan Project dwelling. It has the unmistakable air of having been designed for a very narrow purpose. There's a wall around it covered with a bright blue tarpaulin, as well as several fences and liberal amounts of razor wire.</p>
        <p>Inside the fences, the dynamic is precisely the opposite. The house was built to allow a sublime degree of intrusion. To increase the surface area available to one-way mirrors, Romer struck upon the idea of what he likes to call the camera cross. By cutting an X-shaped corridor right into the heart of the house's architecture, a stealthy crew could capture events deep in the living room, bedrooms and the dining area. Although crew members tiptoed around in their socks and stayed behind the one-way glass, there was no attempt to mask the permanent cameras or the oversize microphones that jutted down cartoonishly from the ceilings. Throughout the taping period, the house -- buzzing with housemates, dozens of soft lights and powerful Halogeen spotjes -- was oppressively hot.</p>
        <p>The inside of the Almere house suggests one conclusion to be drawn from the ''Big Brother'' experiment: when humans are both confined and observed, they tend to write on the walls. They sneak their messages to the outside world garishly and in high spirits. Every wall of the Almere compound was painted with slogans of favorite soccer teams, song lyrics and blocky, dramatic-sounding declarations. Somebody had scrawled, in English, ''To be imprisoned makes you free.'' Across the room was another slogan: ''Vrijheid Bindt!'' (''Freedom Binds!'')</p>
        <p>The scribbling was a natural release. When Dutch housemates tried to communicate in secret, Big Brother admonished them. ''We tried whispering under the blankets, very, very quietly,'' Karin says. ''But within five minutes, Big Brother came on, so strict, and told us to stop. Another day we took the batteries out of the transmitters we had to wear, and he noticed immediately.''</p>
        <p>Housemates tried everything short of Arthur Koestler tap codes. They scratched chalk messages to each other on tabletops. As a final jape, Karin would soundlessly mouth words just to provoke her keepers. But the Voice was always there to set them straight.</p>
        <p>''People did try to whisper, but the microphones are very sensitive,'' recalls Romer, quite amused. ''The Voice would say: 'Come on, be sportive! You knew what you were getting into!'''</p>
        <p>Even though the cast members were volunteers, some in Holland objected to the ''Big Brother'' concept. When the project was leaked to the press a year ago, a guild of Dutch psychologists protested with such venom that the producers took extra pains to choose people who would work together as a team. In Germany, the backlash was not psychological but political; a television-regulating commission in the central German state of Hesse rallied to ban the series altogether. ''In the end,'' Romer says, ''they couldn't find enough of a legal reason to shut us down, but we had to make some concession. The offer was this: we would not record in one bedroom for one hour a day.'' Producers from Endemol Entertainment (the international arm of John de Mol Produkties) duly informed the German housemates of the compromise. But the housemates were not grateful. They didn't want privacy. Reduce the intrusion, they believed, and you reduce the adventure.</p>
        <p>Having survived these two battles, Romer wonders whether protests will erupt in the United States. He seems to hope they do. ''Criticism is essential,'' he explains, lightly chopping his hand on the amber desktop, as though he's dividing up territories. ''If everybody thinks it's great at the beginning, there's no excitement. Better to have some who support you and others who are disgusted. That's what generates discussion.''</p>
        <p>The creators of the American version are not about to soften their product. Whereas ''an excess of fighting bores Dutch viewers,'' according to Romer, Americans love a free-for-all. So although viewers here will be denied the nudity of the European versions, CBS will do its best to serve up the strife. Leslie Moonves rates it as a priority: ''People being catty, talking behind each other's backs, people saying things that those of us watching might not have the guts to say -- that's a release, just as in any drama.''</p>
        <p>Casting criteria for ''Big Brother'' lean toward the formulaic. For the original series, Romer knew what sort of mix he needed: a ''rebel,'' a ''leader,'' a ''mother or father,'' a ''beautiful boy and a beautiful girl'' and what he refers to as a ''bad sister'' type. Even so, something has to drive these semifictional characters into motion. Like subatomic particles, they need to collide, combine or split apart if they're to yield up any drama.</p>
        <p>To that end, the housemates of ''Big Brother'' must undergo some contrived hardships. The Americans will have only small amounts of hot water -- and only between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. (Under similar constraints, the Dutch housemates found themselves limited to 90-second showers.) Cash allotments for food and other necessities will be at most $5 per person per day, and will be increased only if the group achieves a task that Big Brother poses to them for the week. In Holland, that meant memorizing 90 postal codes, walking tightropes and keeping a fire burning outside for four consecutive days and nights.</p>
        <p>If all this sounds like a surreal rendering of domestic life, consider the entertainment provided to housemates: none. There is no TV, no radio. After the few books they carry into the house have been read, that's it. ''On very special occasions in the Almere house,'' says Karin, ''we received a newspaper, but that was so rare.''</p>
        <p>''We don't see real life in these series,'' Romer acknowledges. ''But sometimes, we touch on real personalities. There is a momentary</p>
        <p>reflection of the real self -- and those moments are great television.''</p>
        <p>Some reflections, however, reveal too much of the self. In Holland, there was the Toilet Incident, which made front-page news.</p>
        <p>The reasons for installing a camera in the lavatory at all were said to be twofold. First, John de Mol Produkties was responsible for these people's health: Good God, what if someone had a heart attack in there? Even the Endemol spokesman Thomas Notermans, an elegant man not given to parroting the company line, calls this rationale ''nonsense.'' Second -- and more to the point -- the producers needed to ensure that, having taken such pains to eliminate privacy, there be no blind spot, no flaw in the plan. They couldn't have housemates nipping into the bathroom and engaging in one-on-one chats. Conversation in the house could never be one on one; it would be one on several million or it would be nothing at all.</p>
        <p>But there was a gaffe. At least, Paul Romer describes it as a gaffe. Cynics denounce it as a stunt.</p>
        <p>The way Romer tells it, the director made a mistake: one of those amazing blunders where the planets, well, they just line up against you. It was a Thursday night, and wouldn't you know, that was the night ''Big Brother'' was broadcast live. And wouldn't you know, someone was actually using the bathroom at that very moment. ''Exactly 21 frames went out on the air,'' Romer says. ''That's less than one second. It shouldn't have been possible. But everything goes wrong at the same time. Someone is in there, and she is using the toilet paper at that instant, and two million people are watching!</p>
        <p>''That camera has been disabled for the U.S. version,'' he adds, pounding an imaginary switch into the off position. ''So that's that.''</p>
        <p>''Because of that camera, Sabine had great trouble going to the bathroom for three weeks,'' Karin recalls. ''Then again, she was able to have sex with a housemate near another camera, so what does that mean?''</p>
        <p>Some exhibitionists are made of tougher stuff, or believe themselves to be. Bart Spring in 't Veld, the object of Sabine's amorous affections, was the winner of Holland's ''Big Brother'' -- of both the 250,000 guilders ($110,000) in prize money and, as a neat bonus, of obsessive pursuit by the press. He is in every Dutch tabloid, every week -- in Prive, Weekend and Aktueel.</p>
        <p>But the press has worn him down. As proof of his contempt for fame, when I visit him, he just happens to have a few of his cuttings from the week's newspapers, one of which links him romantically to a centerfold model. ''I don't do interviews,'' he says, two minutes into our interview. ''I hide away from the press.''</p>
        <p>We are huddled in a small office at John de Mol Produkties in Hilversum, the media capital of Holland. Bart's blond hair is meticulously tousled, and his tan seems to be fading by the minute. He behaves not so much like a movie star as a mob witness on the lam: meeting only on extremely short notice, in a safe, closed environment. Any suggestion, say, that we venture into the outside world is taken for lunacy. ''I don't walk down a public street,'' he says. ''That would be a mess.''</p>
        <p>When ''Big Brother'' signed him up, Bart was an out-of-work 22-year-old, coming off almost four years in the army. ''At first,'' he says, ''it was the money that made me apply for the program. But later, it was the . . . what does one say?'' He struggles for the word in English, so I hazard a guess: the challenge?</p>
        <p>''Challenge,'' he says warmly, as if reunited with an old pal. ''It was the challenge.''</p>
        <p>Bart is arrogant and sunny -- a parody of boyishness, exempt from the sorrows of the grown-up world. ''When the film crew came to my door and told me 'Big Brother' wanted me, I wasn't surprised. I was warned there'd be no privacy, but I said: 'To hell with it! Let's go!'''</p>
        <p>The bad-boy label that fit Bart so neatly on TV has become an easy role for him. He has it down pat. Dressed in a ratty Aerosmith shirt, he punctuates his remarks by rolling cigarettes and mischievously flicking bottle caps at me. He is always excited or bored, with no middle gear.</p>
        <p>''Actually, 'Big Brother' was like the army in a few ways,'' he says. ''Not enough food, being with people I didn't know, sleeping in the same room with seven people, being watched always by supervisors.''</p>
        <p>The loss of privacy -- really, the siege effects of voyeurism -- never gave him a moment's pause. ''I am private here,'' he says proudly, pointing at the side of his skull. ''As long as they don't know what you think, you give them nothing. There is a brick wall inside my head!''</p>
        <p>By his own account, Bart leads a fiercely internal life. He wants you to believe that he employs a Mishimalike discipline to protect the rich world of ideas inside his head -- and that it was just this brand of reserve that foiled the attempts of ''Big Brother'' to break him. Also, he enjoys climbing on stuff and says that, at any given time, he was ready to use a cunning plan to bust out of the Almere compound without even going near the front door.</p>
        <p>This is 00's exhibitionism to the core: for every act of exposure, there is another of revolt, where the exhibitionist makes a convulsive break back toward solitude. The island contestants of the American version of ''Survivor'' occasionally ripped out camera wires, though the show's producer chalks this up to jungle grumpiness. Bart's own escape scheme, in any other context, would be ingenious. But here -- since he's talking about a TV studio, which he was free to leave at any time -- well, it probably says more about youthful boredom and bravado.</p>
        <p>Bart grabs a map I have of the compound and scrawls lines all over it. The plan involves checking cameras in various spots around the garden, crawling beneath windows, tightrope-walking to the roof and clambering over the giant fences just beyond the wall. At this point, I'm tempted to ask how he figures on getting past the razor wire, but it's never wise to interrupt a mock-desperate man in the middle of a pretend escape. ''From the last fence,'' he says bravely, narrowing his eyes, ''I would knock down one of the crew, steal his clothes and his pass and drive to Switzerland. Then to Portugal!''</p>
        <p>Later, an Endemol spokeswoman laughs this off. ''Bart never saw the control room,'' she says. ''He can't imagine the angles we had on him. It wouldn't have been so easy.''</p>
        <p>Bart may be the tabloids' biggest target these days, but all the Dutch ''Big Brother'' cast members appear poised to spend the rest of their lives under the lens. In the show's fusion of Warhol and Orwell (or more accurately, the kwik-gloss concepts pop culture has assigned to these names), every housemate has been granted a good deal more than 15 minutes. Two have been featured in Dutch Playboy; others have released hit records. None of this is surprising. Being spied on once is a violation. Being spied on continually is celebrity.</p>
        <p>Most Dutch people try to play down their expertise about the ''Big Brother'' cast members; they remain a bit squeamish about their voyeuristic passions. But the program has been burned into the country's collective memory. Locals recall exactly how Bart and Sabine made love under the blankets -- she was just fooling around, and he was so in love! Or the way Ruud, the 44-year-old teddy bear of a fellow, famous for hugging everyone, wept over a letter from his daughter, who wrote that she missed him so. Or the crazy release of that final night when Bart, his arms outstretched in triumph, made his victory run from the house, half-lost in the dazzle of fireworks. Images like those became the focus of water-cooler chat around the country, as much as any World Cup soccer match or war.</p>
        <p>Many claim to have found ''Big Brother'' a bit repugnant, and take the revealing step of slipping from first- to second-person when they discuss it, as if they weren't obsessed with the monstrous thing. You were.</p>
        <p>''I truly did not like it,'' a man named Wim Dewit tells me one night at a bar in Hilversum. ''But you did watch, all the time. You had to watch to see what would happen -- but almost nothing ever did.''</p>
        <p>It quickly becomes clear that Dewit, a 30-year-old software engineer with feathery blond hair and a doleful manner, knows all about the show. He knows gossip about each housemate and can rattle off their personas without hesitation: how Bart was the arrogant show-off, Sabine the ''dumb game player.'' Honestly though, Dewit says, the whole sordid thing was not his cup of tea: ''This isn't southern Europe, where people practically live their lives right out in the streets!''</p>
        <p>I ask him if he ever visited the show's Web site, that quick fix for voyeur junkies. ''Yes, of course,'' he replies irritably. ''When someone leaves a window open and you look inside, it's spying. But this was a different kind of thing: a proper spying.''</p>
        <p>Before lurching off, Dewit proves just how deep his country's fixation with ''Big Brother'' runs. He quietly tells me -- three months after the series ended -- that there are rumors in the streets. Word has it, he says, that maybe Bart didn't win at all, that maybe there was some funny business played with the telephone voting that elected the winner. ''I've only heard this,'' he cautions, raising his eyebrows. ''But everybody knew Ruud was the most popular. How could Bart have won? You see. It does not make sense.''</p>
        <p>Not all reality pageants buzz with such intrigue. when it comes to capturing raw reality -- so formless, with all that empty time -- the Internet reigns supreme. Television and movies replay the Zapruder film, but only the Net will put you in Oswald's perch right this moment, now that far less is going on up there.</p>
        <p>The most expert, if most reluctant, reality broadcaster in America calls himself Nerdman. Not ''the Nerd Man,'' he cautions: Nerdman, with the stress on the first syllable -- like ''Truman,'' as in the Jim Carrey film. Nerdman.com offers no fewer than 18 cameras. They are trained on almost every corner of his life. Nerdman lovingly installed these Webcams over the past four years, both at work and at home.</p>
        <p>On average, about 1,500 people check into his site every day. In the first four months of this year alone, more than 1,000 people visited the site in excess of 100 times each -- numbers that, in the nonpornography realm, indicate something between loyalty and worship. Last month brought nearly 50,000 viewers, Nerdman's most ever. A lot of his fans log on from Europe, France in particular. ''I've tried to make sense of that,'' he says, ''and the best theory I've arrived at is that it's the source of the word 'voyeur.'''</p>
        <p>The cameras reveal most everything you'd need to see of Nerdman's life. The 12 cameras at work cover his desk, the lot where he parks his car, an underwater view of the fishtank in his reception area and a fine array of other offices and workrooms. Clicking into his home, you find another office (from two angles), a cat-litter box, and even a dark crawlspace. ''We heard a rat scuttling around back there,'' he says. ''So we're trying to catch sight of him.''</p>
        <p>Nerdman has tried to fill the one gap in his production: the drive between home and work. A few years back, he hooked up a wireless in his little red Nissan pickup truck, but the cruel realities of transmission rallied against him. ''I'll have to leave that part of my life blank,'' he says. ''Though if I ever get time someday, I'm sure I could make it work. Of course, if I had that much time, I'd also be curious to perfect an underwater Webcam and one you could wear on a helmet.''</p>
        <p>When I first found Nerdman and wrote to him, he was hesitant to be interviewed. For many weeks, he refused to tell me his real name or where he lives. It bewildered me that a man who surrounded himself with cameras could be an absolutist about privacy. ''This isn't about me, it's about the technology,'' he kept saying. ''What do people care what my name is? I'm anonymous.''</p>
        <p>Curious to see what made him shy, I started tuning in to the 18 cameras he'd installed. I got to know him. I soon gleaned the hours he kept, who his best friend was at work, and how he held his baby when he worked late nights back home. I came to recognize the approximate cycles of his laundry: first the reddish shirt, then the black one with the white stripe, then the pale blue one. I imagined I could gauge his moods.</p>
        <p>Once assured that I didn't view him as a publicity hound, Nerdman opened the books a little. In real life he is a wry 35-year-old named Vance Kozik. He engineers Webcams for StarDot, a company in Buena Park, Calif. Back in 1995, when using these cameras on the Internet was hardly being contemplated, Kozik was fiddling with various ways to show their potential. ''A few years later, I saw the trailer for 'The Truman Show,''' he says. ''It looked like a happy movie to me.'' In the summer of 1998, he started Nerdman.com and became a real-life Truman.</p>
        <p>Kozik in person is unremittingly self-effacing. This whole Nerdman idea, he says, came about because of ''a technical obsession'' with digital images and the challenge of linking cameras to the Net.</p>
        <p>His life is not an ant farm, he insists -- far from it. It's a social experiment. The fact that he appears on these cameras at all is almost incidental. If the Nerdman Show is in any sense exhibitionistic, Kozik insists, its lead actor is a machine. ''I don't know what drives this,'' he says. ''The fact that there's a camera serving live images to anyone over the Internet never ceases to be mind-boggling to me.''</p>
        <p>Although Kozik has chosen to post his life on the Internet, he talks as if there's no way out. ''I have all this traffic now,'' he explains. ''You just can't stop it at that point. If the ratings go up, you don't cancel the show.''</p>
        <p>Kozik lives in Orange County with his wife, Lisa, and their 5-month-old baby, Max. The only evidence of the Nerdman Show in their condo, besides the spidery Webcams poised here and there, is the oppressive heat caused by the computer, which runs all the time.</p>
        <p>Vance's sardonic showmanship -- calling Max ''Nerdbaby'' on the site, using motion detectors to document important moments in the cats' litter box -- has yet to win his wife over to the cause. Though Lisa's modeling career has kept her on good terms with cameras, she is ambivalent.</p>
        <p>''It's just that there's always the chance that some pervert will look in,'' she says haltingly, before brightening things up with a little mock rage. ''And I could breast-feed in a lot more rooms if only we didn't have these damn cameras!''</p>
        <p>Vance is sympathetic to her views -- more than willing to side with her against all the cameras around here. He himself openly admits to being more comfortable out of range of his Webcams. In fact, he says he doesn't like to be photographed. But what can you do.</p>
        <p>The life of Nerdman has divided the Kozik house into safe zones and danger zones. The Koziks may never walk unclothed in their home without thinking it through, unless of course they keep to the sanctuary of the bedroom and the kitchen. And even the kitchen's blind spot has lately been cut in half, thanks to Vance's recent readjustment of Camera 5 -- which did improve the image's composition quite a bit.</p>
        <p>Things were worse in the Koziks' old place. Until they moved to this unnameable suburb a few months ago, they lived in Huntington Beach, where their Webcam nightmare began. The entire living room, kitchen, office and half the dining room all belonged to the voyeurs, which initially drove Lisa to distraction. ''Vance was really excited about it,'' she says. ''He was setting up cameras all over the place and saying, 'Isn't this neat?' I said, 'What am I supposed to do, put on a show?' And he said: 'Do nothing. Just do what you'd normally do.'''</p>
        <p>But the place was an electronic minefield. Just to get from the bedroom to the refrigerator, you had to dodge two cameras: one in the living room and another in the kitchen. So whenever Lisa was not entirely dressed and needed a simple glass of water, a complex series of maneuvers was called into play. Like other cameras, Webcams emit a warning light when they're about to shoot. Solid green yields to a rapid flash: prepare. Then a red light pulses one time when the image is recorded. So, like an escaping prisoner who silently counts off the paces of the guards (or like Bart in Almere), Lisa would watch and wait until she knew it was all right to proceed. She had it down to a science. After the first camera flashed red, she knew she had a few moments to reach the kitchen. Then she'd either wait for the next camera to fire off or use the refrigerator door as a shield.</p>
        <p>A bathroom near the office, happily, offered safe haven -- though anyone emerging from that room would first need to pop his or her head out the door to check if the coast was clear. Again, there were two cameras to contend with. The routine went like this: Crack door. Look right to check camera perched on the computer. Look left to peer into hamster cage to check status of hamstercam. Go.</p>
        <p>All these contortions have become an everyday thing, something Vance and Lisa accept as second nature. Watching for green warning lights is now a Kozik family tradition. The low hum of voluntary surveillance is never completely out of their thoughts. ''It's just timing,'' Vance says equably. ''Nothing complicated, once you get the hang of it.</p>
        <p>''It was an interesting experiment at the old place,'' he adds, ''to see if we could make it all work smoothly.''</p>
        <p>''So, what's the goal now, Vance?'' Lisa asks, as if she has forgotten the shape of those glories around the corner. This is a half-joke they've had running between them for years. ''Now that we've moved, what's the objective?''</p>
        <p>Vance shakes his head slowly, then nods, then laughs: I wish I knew.</p>
        <p>Once in a while, the couple talk about setting up a ''cribcam'' above baby Max. Vance used to say that it might be too early to turn the infant into ''a little victim,'' but that has given way to a new joke: ''It's O.K. He's too young to hate us.''</p>
        <p>Lisa has doubts. ''I'm worried that if there's a camera above his crib all the time, people will see me doing things they consider wrong -- that I'll be criticized as a bad mother suddenly. I can hear the judgments now: 'You shouldn't let him sleep like that! That toy is dangerous!'''</p>
        <p>Some would call this paranoia, but years of viewer response have proved to the Koziks that paranoia, like privacy, is a rather quaint concept -- a dear old myth of yesteryear. Viewers don't miss a thing. Besides the standard e-mail (''Wave at me! Hold up my name on a piece of paper!''), people write in to say they're sure glad Nerdman took a day off work yesterday and how ''relaxed and happy'' he looks today. Or how he must have gotten contact lenses, because why else would he have stopped wearing his glasses, but good for him. Or they ask when he's going to clean out that litter box, because Lord knows it's been a while.</p>
        <p>''I can't believe this is entertaining,'' Vance says, always a little baffled that people log on and even more baffled that so many return. ''Once in a while Lisa and I pose for each other if I'm at work and she's home, or she'll hold up Max for me to see -- these relatively private communications. The next thing we know, the e-mail comes: 'You guys are funny!'''</p>
        <p>Sometimes the attention rattles the Koziks. Back in Huntington Beach, one of the prides of the Nerdman setup was a three-camera panoramic of the Pacific Coast. Over an aqua-blue rail, you could see a small oil derrick and part of the beach. One day, someone sent an e-mail message: ''Hey, I think you might be our neighbor!''</p>
        <p>Vance did not smile at the monitor or feel an agreeable ''small-world glow.'' He did not write back to say: Hey, that is us. Want to meet? Instead, he hastily tapped into his computer to find the Internet Service Provider address of the correspondence and was alarmed to confirm that, as in so many horror movies, the call indeed was coming from nearby.</p>
        <p>To make matters worse, the super of his condo started telling neighbors to check out Nerdman's site. This was awful. Through some unbelievable turn of events, exhibiting his life on the Internet had resulted in people watching his life on the Internet.</p>
        <p>The Koziks had finally met the creature they dread above all: the acquaintance-voyeur who can match Nerdman's electronic life to Kozik's earthly one. Scrutiny is best in the abstract.</p>
        <p>''We had the same reaction when my nephews found out about the site,'' Lisa says. ''They were stoked. They said, 'We'll tell all our friends!' And I said: 'No! Don't tell anybody! Just try to ignore it.' When a cousin of mine ran across it, that really creeped me out.''</p>
        <p>The more I learned about Vance Kozik, the more trouble I had understanding his online drama. The colorful storylines I'd superimposed on his digital pictures were now muddied. Reality had distorted them. Nothing wrecks a shadow play like too much light.</p>
        <p>Logging on one night, I watched Vance and Max up in the home office, sitting near the big fan that the Koziks use to offset the heat of voyeuristic technology. Max had had a fever that day; the expression on Vance's face as he cradled the boy was one I'd never seen on him. I tried to puzzle out the image: was that a new father's panic, or had he just heard something that mildly amused him? When he then walked downstairs to talk to Lisa and lingered there awhile, were they quibbling over the boy's health? Were they giddy with relief? Or were they having some totally different conversation to which, for some crazy reason, I was not privy? (Come to that, was Vance aware that an obsessive examination of the mirror caught by Camera 5 actually showed him in distant reflection?) Even having known them a matter of months, I found that there were suddenly too many imponderables. I liked the Koziks far more in real life than in the Nerdman Show. But I understood them so much better on the Net.</p>
        <p>It was hardly news to me that my Net spying had now exceeded even the most grotesque use of the term ''reportage.'' No, that realization had come weeks earlier, when I'd wasted an entire afternoon staring at live images of deformed frogs somewhere in Minnesota.</p>
        <p>Still, the habit had crept up on me. Until recently, my online daily constitutional had consisted mainly of scanning CNN.com and three international papers. But now I had the Big Itch. Suddenly, I was haunting all sorts of Internet characters. I'd look in on Stanley Burgess, a court reporter, as he typed away (though I drew the line at listening to his karaoke version of ''Make It Real''). I'd check on Stephanie Wukovitz, whose Webcam has for the past few years offered regularly scheduled, PG-rated ''towel dances.'' I would gaze at any number of sites connected to the EarthCam network, to see how things were getting along at Marty's Cantina in Guam, or maybe to watch those penguins at the Bristol Zoo.</p>
        <p>One favorite was a camera aimed at the office cubicle of Sherri Uhrick, an EarthCam producer. True to its genre, the site never showed anything remotely dramatic -- though Sherri had amassed quite an assortment of fans. One Floridian had written dozens of letters informing Sherri that when she moved this or that object on her desk, he just knew it was a special signal to him. A more benign fellow had sent an e-mail message describing her as ''smokin' hot,'' then appended a poem. A portion of it read: ''dapple-eyed, a bang of spider silk hair / you pulse before me in but flashes of radiance. . . . if it was possible to download a heart / you'd have replete access to mine.''</p>
        <p>Part of the appeal of logging on to these sites, I began to realize, was that it fulfilled an innate human desire for shared experience. The tag line of the German ''Big Brother'' site -- Du bist nicht allein! -- cut straight to the heart of it. You are not alone! I was bonding with an unseen crowd of fellow watchers.</p>
        <p>But the draw was more complex. Given the Net's vast number of unregulated feeds, there was always the chance that, racing through such a lawless frontier, I'd see something illicit: sex, rage, unfiltered joy. Despite being part of an audience of spies, at any turn, I alone might witness an accidental moment. That was something television couldn't offer, because -- and here's a rare complaint -- there's just too little of it these days.</p>
        <p>Although I didn't speak the language, the German ''Big Brother'' site could always be relied upon for a quarter-hour of perplexing fun. Clicking through the site from one camera to the next (one must actually seek the housemates out, guided only by the sound of voices), I never failed to find them absorbed in one of their weekly humiliations. Like an invited ghost, I stood alongside them as they washed dishes, played chess and lifted weights. It was hypnotic. My only regret is that I never figured out why the housemate called John sleeps on the pavement out in the yard.</p>
        <p>As I caromed from site to site, I'd sometimes recall what Thomas Notermans, the Endemol spokesman, had told me about their hit show. ''Part of the appeal of 'Big Brother' is secret even to us,'' he'd said, brushing aside his rogue forelock. ''But it's interesting how, say, housewives and professors watch the program in entirely different ways. Less-educated people see the soap opera. People with more education see the social experiment, which is interesting even if nothing happens.''</p>
        <p>I liked this whole social-experiment theory very much. It meant that my motives were pure. I wasn't some prurient slackjaw who was in it for the action. Far from it.</p>
        <p>The truth, of course, was that I'd never been far from it. I'd been immersed in voyeurism, without a shred of ironic distance to protect me. It hardly mattered that my targets were plain instead of pornographic. I'd hunted willing prey, like one of those ghastly game ranches in Texas where you stroll up to a rhino and shoot it from the back.</p>
        <p>There was only one person I knew who would comprehend this level of ambivalence: Vance Kozik. Conveniently, there were a few little details I needed to check with him anyway. So, very late one night -- with visual proof that he was sitting at his phone -- I called. We played a jokey game of stalker-and-victim. I demanded to know where he and Lisa had been all weekend. I grilled him about Camera 5 to find out if he knew how much it exposed. Chuckling, I asked if that was ''Sesame Street'' he and Max had been watching earlier in the day. He chuckled back.</p>
        <p>To get a clearer sight of Vance, I raised my palm and brushed the dust off my computer screen. It was cool to the touch. There was no heat on my side of the glass; all the heat was on his side, in the constant swelter of his terrarium.</p>
        <p>As our conversation wound down, I asked a final mock-serious question: Had Vance changed shirts today? Because I could've sworn I'd seen a yellow shirt in the morning and a blue one later on. What was that all about?</p>
        <p>Vance laughed, then stopped. My pixilated image of him made a choppy motion, as he seemed to weigh his answer. ''Here's something to consider,'' he said good-naturedly. ''Quit lookin' at me.''</p>
        <p>Right. Sleep would clear this up. Before slouching off to bed, by force of habit, I had a look in on the Germans, in case I'd missed anything. I was no longer transported. But I was transfixed.</p>
