        <p>SOON after Peter Olson assumed leadership of Random House Inc., the nation's largest trade publisher, in 1998, he started looking at the company's standard offers to starting employees in New York.</p>
        <p>What he found, he said, was ''appalling.'' Like many other major trade publishers, the company, a unit of Bertelsmann, sometimes offered less than $20,000 a year to 300 to 400 entry-level employees, even as New York's job and housing markets were overheating. Publishers apparently expected young people to be lured by the psychic rewards of a glamorous field; there was also the unspoken view that many young employees could rely on their parents to subsidize their efforts to break into the literary world.</p>
        <p>In July 1998, without much notice, Mr. Olson raised the minimum salary to $25,000. This month, he announced a plan to increase starting pay to $30,000 -- still not exactly great shakes in the business world, but with the promise of corresponding pay increases to other lower-level employees. The pledge had immediate ripples, with some employees pressing for increased pay at other large publishing houses.</p>
        <p>''We had a long tradition of not paying very much,'' said Mr. Olson, acknowledging what liberal-arts graduates have been saying for years. He said the idea for the change stemmed from the realities of the cost of living in New York. ''We want to send a clear message to potential employees and people who have been working at Random House that we're trying to address their concerns.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Olson, a lawyer who started his publishing career in 1992 as chief operating officer of Bantam Doubleday Dell, said Random House also intended to evaluate quality-of-life issues like child care benefits that could include emergency backup care. It will also look at vacations; the company now gives new employees two weeks a year.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Olson is not yet prepared to offer European-style breaks of five weeks or more that might give an employee enough time, say, to dream up a proposal for the Great American Novel.</p>
