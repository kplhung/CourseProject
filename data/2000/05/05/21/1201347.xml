        <p>If all continues to go well, the nation's capital will be allowed out of the intensive care ward fashioned by Congress sometime next year. The District of Columbia will not only regain home-rule prerogatives lost in its profligate past; it will also confirm the stewardship of Mayor Anthony A. Williams, an unlikely politician as bland in his style as the paint on the municipal walls.</p>
        <p>''There's a sea change from four years ago,'' the mayor said, his zest characteristically masked as he pursued a budget fight with the district council and tackled a school crisis. He hailed these problems as a healthy sign of the revival of local respectability.</p>
        <p>''Here we are debating not whether we're going to spend the city into the ground or not,'' Mr. Williams said. ''The new question is how much we're going to invest in the future.''</p>
        <p>This city-state by the Potomac, the perennial ward that Congress seems delighted to scold and micromanage, is clearly moving to a higher ground of civic morale. Constituents' confidence about the city's direction has more than doubled in the less than two years of the Williams administration, with 7 in 10 residents feeling positive about the city's course, according to polls of the district's often demoralized public.</p>
        <p>Even more important, some of the watchdogs of Capitol Hill are snapping less.</p>
        <p>''Mayor Williams is making real progress in turning around Washington,'' said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, the Texas Republican who heads the District of Columbia subcommittee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams arrived here in 1995 as a grim technocrat and emergency budget cutter when Congress created a board of financial overseers to halt the capital's spiral of deficits and mismanagement and hired him as chief financial officer. From that narrow opportunity, he molted into a competitive politician and became the people's choice in a difficult time.</p>
        <p>In his 16 months of incumbency, the 48-year-old mayor has labored to replace the city's wastrel image of the flamboyant Marion Barry era with his own jot-and-tittle devotion to quiet executive techniques. In a way, the best measure of Mr. Williams's initial success may be the fact that he is sometimes criticized for lacking the populist flash of Mr. Barry.</p>
        <p>''He suffers from terminal caution,'' complained Mark Plotkin, a relentless civic goad and the political commentator for the local public radio station WAMU. Mr. Plotkin made the mayor sound like Calvin Coolidge, complimenting him for installing ''rectitude and calm'' in the city but faulting him for failing to fully tap the energy of his electoral mandate and ''take us to another plane'' by fighting with passion for needs like full self-rule and voting rights for the city's Congressional delegate.</p>
        <p>''Well, we've had flair before,'' the district council chairwoman, Linda W. Cropp, said of the Barry era. She expressed no regret for the businesslike Williams style, even as she confronts him in the budget fight.</p>
        <p>''He's given the district a sense of hope that things can happen,'' Ms. Cropp said. ''He has many wonderful ideas, although when it comes to implementing them he's still on a learning curve.''</p>
        <p>Major problems like the tattered school system and persistent youth violence are far from solved. But the mayor and the council seem resolved to innovate: they are presenting the voters a referendum next month to give the mayor a role in school management through the power to appoint some members of the school board. They are also on the way to delivering four balanced budgets in a row, the required formula for regaining home-rule powers after years of chimerical bookkeeping.</p>
        <p>In this endeavor, Mr. Williams has assiduously avoided what in the Barry era came to be known as ''the race card'' -- harvesting the vote of the divided district's black working-class majority by playing off the affluent white minority.</p>
        <p>''I would never personally use race as an excuse for anything,'' said Mr. Williams, a Yale graduate. In an interview, he emphasized his obligation to unify and not to deal with the criticism, by now a cliche, that he might not be ''black enough'' for a city that is 60 percent black.</p>
        <p>''I'm not saying it's not appropriate for others,'' he said of racial complaints. ''But I've been given a lot of opportunities and advantages where I'm sure I can personally say race plays a role.''</p>
        <p>The mayor stressed that Washington ''is still very fractured and divided.'' But he insisted that unheralded programs of mutual good will crisscross the Anacostia River, the city's main racial dividing line. He maintained that a recent increase in auto registrations indicated the viability of his goal of gaining 100,000 residents in this decade, including returning suburbanites attracted by the district's walkable neighborhoods and burnished housing stock.</p>
        <p>Across the Anacostia in one of the low-income southeast wards that are part of the black political power base, the new mayor, despite his ruling-class aura, occasioned no great complaint at Brace's Unisex salon on Minnesota Avenue.</p>
        <p>''Mayor Barry was a great people person,'' Alice Taylor said. ''This new mayor is working at a different angle. But he's doing O.K.''</p>
        <p>Her friend Clara Sherrod agreed. ''Barry was a street politician who knew our problems,'' she said. ''But I'd say the streets are really looking better with Williams. He's having grass planted around here and cleaning up things.''</p>
        <p>Over in Georgetown, part of the district's white power base in the northwest quarter, there is palpable pleasure at the way the Williams bow tie is replacing the Barry dashiki as a D.C. signature. ''He's made the city a lot more presentable,'' said Pat Scanlon, a volunteer at the Christ Child Opportunity Shop, a consignment store on Wisconsin Avenue that finances local charities.</p>
        <p>Nearby, a white customer who would not give his name grumbled: ''He still thinks this is a black city and packs the payroll with his own. What about us?''</p>
        <p>''Well, it is a black city,'' Ms. Scanlon responded. ''So what's wrong with hiring your people who are qualified so they work and pay taxes and have nice houses?''</p>
        <p>In the Barry years, the payroll for the district, which must provide a mix of state and city services, was criticized as a strategic patronage trough when it ballooned to 50,000 employees for a city of 550,000. It has been cut since the fiscal crisis was declared five years ago; this year it reached a Congressionally authorized level of 32,719, a reduction of 1,450 from last year, although Mr. Williams wants it still lower.</p>
        <p>''Running this city is like Roebling trying to build the Brooklyn Bridge and digging and digging for the bedrock,'' he said in frustration. He said he kept uncovering the ''muck'' of old corruption as he tried to reform such scandal-ridden agencies as the mental retardation treatment program, whose lethal failures were laid bare by The Washington Post.</p>
        <p>''My answer is what I call agency bypass surgery,'' he said of a radical plan to create an entire new treatment agency alongside the existing failed system to supersede it.</p>
        <p>The depth of these past failures has prompted Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district's Congressional delegate, to caution that any criticism of Mayor Williams ''should be tempered by the disaster disguised as a city'' that he inherited.</p>
        <p>''He's making this city work,'' Ms. Norton said. ''He's what we needed -- a mayor who came to office who had done something other than run for office.''</p>
        <p>While he is portrayed as an un-politician who is making the city forget the slick Barry era, Mr. Williams actually apprenticed seriously in practical politics as an elected member of the New Haven board of aldermen when he was studying at Yale for his undergraduate degree in economics. Twenty years later, he is not above artfully stroking his Capitol Hill watchdogs; he even attended a fund-raiser for an influential conservative Republican, Representative Ernest Istook of Oklahoma.</p>
        <p>''I've got to look out for my people, you know,'' the mayor explained, unapologetic about becoming the complete practitioner in the nation's ultimate political city.</p>
