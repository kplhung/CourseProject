        <p>Responding to a call to improve the quality of cancer care in the United States, a leading cancer organization said here today that it was working with other groups to develop a national system to monitor how well each cancer patient is treated.</p>
        <p>The effort will begin this summer when researchers from Harvard University and the RAND Corporation begin examining the medical records of 600 patients to determine their outcomes from two types of cancer.</p>
        <p>The first phase will be conducted in Cleveland, Houston and Los Angeles and will involve 300 people with breast cancer and an additional 300 patients with cancer of the colon and rectum, the study's leaders said at the opening of a meeting here of the American Society of Clinical Oncologists, the leading group of cancer specialists in this country.</p>
        <p>The ultimate goal is to develop specific measures of quality spanning the entire course of care, from diagnosis to cure or death. Such measures could then be used to hold health care providers accountable for the quality of cancer care. An estimated 1.2 million Americans will develop cancer this year. Cancer is second to heart disease as a cause of death among Americans and one of the most expensive diseases to treat.</p>
        <p>Breast and colo-rectal cancers were chosen because consensus for their care is greater than for other major cancers, said Dr. Deborah Kamin, the oncologist group's director of public policy.</p>
        <p>The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation is the study's major sponsor, paying about half of the $2 million cost. Other contributors are groups representing surgeons, radiation therapists, nurses and the drug industry.</p>
        <p>The three cities were chosen to provide a representative look at how different minority populations are treated. The study may be expanded to other cities to include 2,000 patients and possibly lung cancer if an additional $1 million is found, Dr. Kamin said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Cases will be chosen at random among those whose cancer was discovered two years ago, thus allowing enough time to complete a first round of therapy. Some patients may be in relapse and others may be dead.</p>
        <p>Because each patient may have received care at more than one medical center, the study could involve as many as 10 hospitals in each city. As is standard, the researchers will obtain permission from an ethics committee at each hospital before examining records and interviewing patients.</p>
        <p>After determining whether therapy was intended for cure or palliation, the researchers will seek information about the therapies offered and given at each critical decision-making step in the patients' care.</p>
        <p>Among the questions: Did surgeons recommend consultations with an oncologist? If treatment involved chemotherapy, were the correct drugs chosen and given in the proper amount? Was pain relief achieved? Was hospice care offered? And how well managed were other end-of-life care options?</p>
        <p>Also, the researchers will interview the same patients to correlate what they say they were told with what doctors, nurses, nutritionists and other health professionals wrote in the records.</p>
        <p>Patients and their families will be asked: Were all appropriate medical options explained and choices given? For example, were the patients offered radiation therapy after breast conserving therapy? Were doctors available when needed to answer questions and offer care? Did doctors recommend entering a clinical trial to evaluate newer therapies? Did the patients join a support group?</p>
        <p>The oncology group's president, Dr. Joseph S. Bailes, who practices in Houston, said the effort was in response to a report released in April 1999 by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. In addressing issues in the prevention, control, diagnosis, treatment and palliation of cancer, the institute said that there was ''a growing lack of public confidence'' in the nation's system of fragmented cancer care.</p>
        <p>''There is no national cancer care program or system of care in the United States,'' the report said. It also said that the government had numerous cancer programs and research, ''but in no one place are these disparate efforts coordinated or even described.''</p>
        <p>A substantial, but unmeasured, number of cancer patients do not receive care known to be effective for their condition, the medical institute said, and the reasons for failure to deliver high quality care could come from overuse, underuse or misuse of proper therapy but have not been studied adequately.</p>
        <p>Conducting clinical trials to determine the safety and effectiveness of therapies is a first step in assessing quality. But too few patients participate in such trials even though studies show that routine care costs in cancer clinical trials are no more than in standard care, cancer experts have said.</p>
