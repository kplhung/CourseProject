        <p>THE singer-songwriter Vance Gilbert's easygoing humor and jazz-infused style are as welcome on the folk circuit as a cool breeze in August. Having grown up listening to his parents' Dinah Washington and Ray Charles records, it is surprising that he became a folk musician at all.</p>
        <p>''When I got to college, people were listening to the J's: Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, Jackson Browne,'' said Mr. Gilbert, who performs at 8 p.m. on Saturday at Good Folk Coffeehouse in Rowayton. ''When I picked up my first guitar back then,'' he added ''it was an acoustic one.''</p>

        <p>THE singer-songwriter Vance Gilbert's easygoing humor and jazz-infused style are as welcome on the folk circuit as a cool breeze in August. Having grown up listening to his parents' Dinah Washington and Ray Charles records, it is surprising that he became a folk musician at all.</p>
        <p>''When I got to college, people were listening to the J's: Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, Jackson Browne,'' said Mr. Gilbert, who performs at 8 p.m. on Saturday at Good Folk Coffeehouse in Rowayton. ''When I picked up my first guitar back then,'' he added ''it was an acoustic one.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gilbert's latest CD, the self-produced ''Somerville Live'' demonstrates his talent as a songwriter, singer and raconteur. Its 16 tracks represent up-beat energy, an elasticized vocal range and self-effacing sense of humor.</p>
        <p>''Bill Morrissey once said to me, 'You've played a lot of bars.' I think that is one of the nicest compliments I've heard,'' said the Boston-based Mr. Gilbert, referring to his fellow New England folkie.</p>
        <p>His jocose nature often makes people forget that Mr. Gilbert writes about painful experiences as well as joyous ones. Fans expect to hear his satirical ''Country Western Rap'' (''My 'Alice's Restaurant','' he said, referring to Arlo Guthrie's signature song). When he starts up one of his ballads, it offers ''serious relief.''</p>
        <p>''It's not the happy songs that bring integrity to the set,'' he said. ''People like the sad songs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gilbert, who will perform July 15 in the Beardsley Zoo's folk concert series in Bridgeport, became a musician relatively late in life. Although he listened to plenty of his family's records growing up in Philadelphia, he said it was not until he arrived at Connecticut College in New London that he picked up an instrument.</p>
        <p>''I played bass,'' he said. ''It was easier to start with than a six-string guitar. But I couldn't be as loquacious. So I picked up an acoustic guitar -- couldn't afford an electric one.''</p>
        <p>In picking up the guitar, Mr. Gilbert also picked up his grades. The biology major found fuel for the soul in music even if his days were filled with drier curriculum.</p>
        <p>During college Mr. Gilbert went to a Kenny Rankin concert. It was a turning point. ''Kenny was taking old standards and giving them a jazz styling that was unlike anything I heard before,'' Mr. Gilbert said. ''That's what I wanted to do.''</p>
        <p>Soon after graduation in 1975, ''like about 20 minutes later,'' he said, he drove to Boston. He worked a variety of survival jobs for three years before setting out on a career in music. Though Mr. Gilbert's early gigs were not exactly glamorous, they helped him develop a comfort level with audiences.</p>
        <p>''My gig-from-hell was strolling through a Lawn Boy store, singing standards,'' he said with a chuckle. ''At one point I could recall over 2,000 songs. I couldn't play them all well, but I knew them.''</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Gilbert hooked up with the jazz-folk duo Tuck and Patty. Mr. Gilbert's own talent matured enough to earn him a opening spot on the couple's tour. ''I learned a lot from Tuck's incredible guitar and Patty's jazz stylings,'' he said. ''We're still great friends.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gilbert soon got another break. Shortly after seeing Shawn Colvin, one of the most prominent names in folk music, perform at the Old Vienna Coffeehouse in western Massachusetts, he befriended her. In 1992, Mr. Gilbert was opening for her on tour, and he credits her with opening his eyes as a songwriter.</p>
        <p>''Shawn was writing songs about her experience,'' he said. ''Her perspective is unique.''</p>
        <p>People say the same of Mr. Gilbert. Though now he plays such places as Symphony Hall in Boston and the Kerrville (Texas) Folk Festival instead of retail stores, he has never forgotten the lesson those gigs taught him. ''Putting people in the seats and keeping them there,'' he said. ''That's what it's all about.''</p>
        <p>Vance Gilbert performs at 8 p.m. on Saturday at the Good Folk Coffeehouse, Rowayton United Methodist Church, Rowayton Avenue, Rowayton (203-866-4450). He also performs on July 15 at the Beardsley Zoo's Folk Concert Series in Bridgeport (203-394-6565).
