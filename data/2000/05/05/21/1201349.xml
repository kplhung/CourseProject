        <p>In the flush of victory after Team New Zealand's thrashing of Italy's Prada Challenge in the finals of February's America's Cup competition, the triumphant Kiwi skipper, Russell Coutts, struck a resounding chord with his countrymen when he proclaimed that he hoped to be at the forefront of a sailing dynasty that would retain the cup for at least the next two decades.</p>
        <p>With the reins of administrative power for the team being handed over to Coutts and his lieutenants, the tactician Brad Butterworth and the navigator Tom Schnackenberg -- and a solid corps of the world's best sailors on their flanks -- no one accused Coutts of idle boasting.</p>
        <p>But now, Coutts's patriotic nautical vision seems emptier than a deflated balloon. On Friday in Auckland, in an unexpected bombshell that rocked their nation to its core, Coutts and Butterworth declared that they were resigning from Team New Zealand effective immediately.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's front-page headline in the country's largest newspaper, The New Zealand Herald, captured the mood of a stunned populace: We Feel Betrayed.</p>
        <p>For Team New Zealand supporters, the news soon went from bad to worse. On Friday, people in New Zealand and the United States with knowledge of the arrangement confirmed that Coutts and Butterworth had agreed to join forces with Ernesto Bertarelli, a Swiss pharmaceutical heir, in an unannounced campaign to return home in 2002-3 as the key components of an overseas cup challenge. Moreover, they will be joined by three of Team New Zealand's most talented veterans: the sail trimmers Simon Daubney and Warwick Fleury and the bowman Dean Phipps.</p>
        <p>Sailing under the banner of Team Magic, the five Kiwi sailors have been a powerful force on the international match-racing circuit, also winning the world championship in 1996.</p>
        <p>For weeks, speculation about Kiwi defections has swept through the sailing community. Several American billionaires, including Bill Gates, denied their reported involvement. Because of his stature with Team New Zealand, Coutts was widely believed to be untouchable. And Bertarelli's name came as a surprise to many.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it shouldn't have. The Italian-born, Swiss-bred Bertarelli, who is in his mid-30's, is the chief executive of Ares-Serono -- a world leader in fertility drugs. He took over the position from his father. A graduate of Babson College in Boston, where he played squash, he later earned an M.B.A. at Harvard. Forbes magazine has listed the Bertarelli fortune at $4.2 billion.</p>
        <p>Bertarelli is a yachtsman who has campaigned several multihull racing boats and at one stage bankrolled an eight-boat fleet of 80-foot maxi yachts in an international series of regattas patterned after the Formula One car-racing circuit.</p>
        <p>With his recruitment of Coutts and his mates, Bertarelli instantly becomes a cup player. He may also be a trend setter. Cup insiders believe that at least two other members of Forbes's ranking of the world's 100 wealthiest people are close to committing to first-time cup challenges. If so, the veteran cup helmsmen Chris Dickson, a Kiwi, and the Australian Peter Gilmour, are next in line for major overseas paydays.</p>
        <p>Such maneuverings, says Marcus Hutchinson, a spokesman for the Louis Vuitton challenger's series, ''shows how the America's Cup has become a sport, not unlike Formula One, where drivers move from team to team beyond national barriers.'' That may be true, but in the wake of the Team New Zealand breakup, it will be a tough sell to the average New Zealander.</p>
        <p>A person familiar with the team's inner workings, however, said that Coutts and Butterworth, as administrators, found themselves in an untenable financial situation. The final barrier may have been a deal arranged by the previous team trust, fronted by Sir Peter Blake, which gave the team's five major corporate sponsors the right of first refusal to come aboard for the next defense.</p>
        <p>The deal locked the sponsors in at the same monetary commitment as the 2000 campaign, for a budget of about $25 million. Many believe it will take a minimum of $50 million to be competitive next time. In effect, the arrangement presented Coutts with a conservative cap on salaries and technology research and development that may have been unrealistic in the face of his own expectations. A government grant of several million dollar to the Team New Zealand coffers late last week appeared to be too little, too late.</p>
        <p>Coutts may also have been the victim of a Catch-22 of his own making. When he handed the helm to his protege, the 26-year-old helmsman Dean Barker, for the final cup match, he was hailed as a benevolent captain. But the gesture paved the way for younger sailors to come up through the ranks, a forward-moving plan that would be impossible to reverse. Coutts may have concluded that his fires were still burning and felt the best opportunity for an on-the-water role lay elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Now, Barker and Schnackenberg will move into the top roles at Team New Zealand. They undoubtedly have the support of their nation. But it's hard to escape the notion that, for the team's once invincible crew, more stormy seas lie ahead.</p>
        <p>MAKING WAVES</p>
        <p>In the aftermath of a disappointing United States effort in the last America's Cup -- for the first time, there was no American boat in the finals -- talks began between officers of the New York Yacht Club and the St. Francis Yacht Club of San Francisco about merging forces in a joint challenge for the next running of the event. But late last week, the parties announced that they had abandoned the notion of pursuing an alliance.</p>
