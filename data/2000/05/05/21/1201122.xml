        <p>They play their home games here in New Jersey in a stadium the state built expressly for them. They practice here. Their corporate headquarters are in the stadium here.</p>
        <p>Indeed, they are the New York Giants.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1925, the Giants have always had the New York prefix, even after moving to Giants Stadium when it was completed in 1976 -- although the geography then became a bit murkier. The ''NY'' that appeared on the helmets was removed and ''Giants'' was scrawled across them instead.</p>
        <p>All that was fine with 40-year-old Tracy Penn -- a lifelong Giants fan who was raised in Watchung and still lives there -- until his team announced last month that in keeping with the current cultural craving for all things retro, the Giants would revert to the  ''NY'' logo on their headgear similar to one it used before moving to the Meadowlands. After all, the Jets went back to their old uniforms in 1998, and even natural grass is returning to the stadium this year.</p>
        <p>In response, Mr. Penn, the Libertarian son of a former Republican state Assemblyman, Jack Penn, launched a Web site -- newjerseygiants.com -- two weeks ago, where he sold blue Giants T-shirts bearing an ''NJ'' logo, designed by his English wife, Kerry (a rugby fan), in the same lowercase style of the Giants old-is-new-again insignia.</p>
        <p>''If you're going to play in New Jersey, call yourself the New Jersey Giants,'' said Mr. Penn, a communications entrepreneur, who works out of his home. ''It's a parody, but it's a protest.''</p>
        <p>The Giants were not amused, and last week the team's lawyers tried to stop Mr. Penn's pass at parody. He said he received a letter demanding that he stop selling the T-shirts and shut down the Web site.</p>
        <p>He stopped hawking the shirts briefly after selling out the first batch of 100, but  insisted on maintaining the site. Then last week, he decided to resume selling them.</p>
        <p>''It's freedom of speech,'' Mr. Penn said.</p>
        <p>But John Mara, the team's executive vice president and general counsel, said that Mr. Penn stepped out of bounds when he sold his first T-shirt, and that he is now vulnerable to a copyright infringement suit by the team and NFL Properties, the licensing arm of the National Football League -- the First Amendment notwithstanding.</p>
        <p>''It's not a question of being a protected form of speech,'' Mr. Mara said. ''He's trying to profit from using our trademark.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mara said the team adopted the ''Giants'' logo specifically out of sensitivity to New Jersey fans. But the old ''NY'' logo is simply more attractive, he said, adding that it worked like a charm in 1994 when adopted to celebrate the National Football League's 50th anniversary.</p>
        <p>''I think we won every game that year that we used that logo,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As for the New York prefix, he added, ''It happens to be the name that we were born with and the name that most or our fans associate with, and it's not something we're willing to consider changing. I think that we represent the metropolitan area, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mara did say that he would be ''comfortable'' with Mr. Penn's Web site if it were purely a noncommercial forum, something Mr. Penn first said he was willing to discuss but later rejected.</p>
        <p>Last month Governor Whitman got into the dispute, issuing a statement that she was ''disappointed'' by the Giants' logo change.</p>
        <p>But John Samerjan, a spokesman for the stadium's official owner, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, whose lease with the Giants extends through 2026, said logos and place names are a team's call.</p>
        <p>''From time to time, with the football franchises, we do get questions from fans as to why they're still called New York,'' Mr. Samerjan said. ''What's happened over the years is that people do tend to see things regionally. But it does tend to become more of a public brush fire when something like this happens.''</p>
