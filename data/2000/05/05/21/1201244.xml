        <p>PRATIQUE, always pratique.'' Announcing her credo in a Gallic drone, Carlyne Cerf de Dudzeele, a freelance fashion editor, was about to put it to the test. She reached into the depths of her Hermes Birkin bag -- a high-capacity satchel that could, in a pinch, hold her terrier, Jack -- and pulled out a minuscule shoulder bag spattered with tawny LV's.</p>
        <p>Trim and flat as a postcard, it would see her through lunch. Ms. de Dudzeele's second sack holds little more than a lipstick, a credit card and a set of keys -- just right for this professional vagabond, whose day might take her from an office to a NoLiTa boutique to Seventh Avenue and back, ending in a late-night dinner with friends. A woman who lives the maxim ''You can't be too streamlined or too thin,'' she reaches reflexively for her Louis Vuitton Pochette whenever she heads for a restaurant, leaving her tote at the office or the coat check.</p>
        <p>Ms. de Dudzeele, who has spent the better part of her career obsessing over details of self-packaging, is at home with the notion that a big bag packs power, while its smaller companion carries a different sort of clout.</p>
        <p>''This bag may be so small it barely holds a lipstick, but it's definitely the status bag,'' said Laird Borrelli the co-author, with Valerie Steele, of ''The Handbag: A Lexicon of Style'' (Rizzoli). The tote, by contrast, is usually more humble, Ms. Borrelli pointed out. ''I think of the canvas L. L. Bean version carried by Conde Nast editors,'' she said. ''Both together function as a survival kit for the glamour puss.''</p>
        <p>Kate Spade, the handbag designer, who personally subscribes to the two-bag system, said: ''For a while, I think it was just people in fashion who carried two bags. But now a lot of people have picked up on the idea. It's a trend, absolutely. The small bag is so prevalent now that you have to carry another bag.''</p>
        <p>Designers have pounced on the trend. Tod's, Lambertson Truex and Burberry are among a number of companies that have recently introduced or plan to introduce matched sets of handbags, meant for the woman who must have two. ''Women tend to use a larger bag for practicality, a smaller one for fashion and social reasons,'' noted Richard Lambertson of Lambertson Truex. ''We believe in merging the pair.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Borrelli said that the trimmer, daintier bag is the one with the fancier provenance. ''It was associated way back with the chatelaine of the castle,'' she said. ''Her servants did the marketing. She was required to carry no more than embroidery tools, a handkerchief and smelling salts.'' Placed on a lunch or dinner table, the contemporary model becomes ''a bibelot,'' she added, ''part of a milieu and also part of the conversation.''</p>
        <p>Many women feel as she does that the compact style denotes class. Marian Rivman, a New York public relations consultant, stashes a small shoulder bag inside her satchel to pull out at receptions and meetings. ''The Queen of England, you always see her with a handkerchief and little purse, and she's not carrying a dime,'' Ms. Rivman rationalized. ''A small bag means refinement. It means you have your stuff together.''</p>
        <p>More important, it's sexy. ''Do you really want, in a room full of men, to go fishing into your tote for a business card?'' Ms. Rivman asked pointedly.</p>
        <p>Frances Beatty Adler, an art dealer and the vice president of Richard Feigen &amp; Company, finds her small bag liberating. She walks to work each day with a shiny brown leather tote from Tod's. ''If you're busy and have a lot of things on your plate, you carry it around in the hope you might be able to get them done,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But its weight and the burden of chores left undone sometimes leaves her winded. ''I often feel like a donkey,'' she said. That's where her second bag comes in. A medium-size fake Kelly, it makes her feel like a sprite. ''Sometimes I feel it's my right not to be burdened,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As style watchers see it, the small bag is a badge of hip. ''It reflects a woman who is definitely streamlining herself,'' said Daniel Harris, who wrote ''The Content of Women's Purses,'' an essay published in 1995 in Salmagundi, a literary magazine. ''You can actually take it out on the dance floor.''</p>
        <p>''In contrast, the larger bag represents a stodgy matron with a big dowdy purse that impedes her mobility,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As distasteful as such an image may be, it hasn't induced most two-bag women to part with their thunderous totes. The reason, Mr. Harris suggested, is that the large bag is an emblem of ''a woman's migration from private life into public life,'' as a consequence of which the bag functions as ''a surrogate home'' replete with items more commonly found on desk tops and dressing tables, and even in the kitchen sink (like a can opener).</p>
        <p>Ms. Adler, for one, views her large bag as a traveling survival kit. It houses art magazines, auction catalogs, paperbacks for reading in a cab, part of the contents of her lunch and her children's hockey and lacrosse schedules. ''You never know,'' she said, ''when you're going to get stuck in an elevator.''</p>
        <p>Marta Ibarrondo, a freelance advertising art director, said: ''Personally, I feel like I'm always traveling. I work in New York, but on most days I carry as many things as when I'm in an airport -- cookies and sunflower seeds, nail polish, face cream -- you name it.''</p>
        <p>Still, there are those who swim against the current. It takes a leap of courage, but from time to time Irene Albright forsakes her tote for something trimmer. The owner of Imelda's Closet, a fashion rental business that caters to stylists, Ms. Albright believes in rigorous editing. She has, accordingly, reduced the contents of her purse to a small Filofax, a wallet, a compact and keys.</p>
        <p>Though she struggles to make less do more, she asks herself from time to time if she's being realistic. ''Can I keep this up?'' she asked. '' Who knows? One lives in hope.''</p>
