        <p>In a rousing speech to an A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention in New Jersey, Vice President Gore used the attack word secret seven times. It is now his favorite adjective, having temporarily replaced risky (as in the phrase, pronounced as one word, riskytaxscheme).</p>

        <p>In a rousing speech to an A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention in New Jersey, Vice President Gore used the attack word secret seven times. It is now his favorite adjective, having temporarily replaced risky (as in the phrase, pronounced as one word, riskytaxscheme).</p>
        <p>He was blazing away at Governor Bush's proposal, not yet detailed, to allow individuals to divert a portion of their Social Security taxes into the stock market. Gore charged that Bush believed ''it would be best not to let you, the voters of this country, in on the secret plan before the election. . . . He is suppressing the details of how his plan would work and refusing to divulge what his secret plan really is.'' At a subsequent news conference, he evidently felt that secret was not pejorative enough and added, redundantly, a ''private secret plan.''</p>
        <p>That sinister phrase -- secret plan -- has resonance to veteran rhetoricians and students of presidential campaigns. In the 1968 primaries, candidate Richard Nixon was searching for a way to promise he would extricate the U.S. from its increasingly unpopular involvement in Vietnam. The key verb to be used was end, though it would be nice to get the verb win in some proximity to it.</p>
        <p>One speechwriter came up with the formulation that ''new leadership will end the war and win the peace in the Pacific.'' Nixon made it part of his stump speech, and the juxtaposition of end and win -- though it did not claim to intend to win the war, but only the peace -- drove his major opponent for the G.O.P. nomination, Gov. George Romney of Michigan, up the wall.</p>
        <p>When a U.P.I. reporter pressed Nixon for specifics, the candidate demurred; the reporter wrote that it seemed Nixon was determined to keep his plan secret, though he did not quote Nixon as having said either secret or plan. But this gave Romney a chance to slam back at his opponent's promise. In what became the centerpiece of his stump speech in the snows of New Hampshire, Romney demanded to know, ''Where is your secret plan?'' That question skillfully presupposed an assertion of not just a general promise but also a detailed plan, and soon it became widely accepted that Nixon had said, ''I have a secret plan to end the war.''</p>
        <p>Years later, when a New York Times columnist attributed that direct quote to Nixon, a White House speechwriter challenged him to find the quote in anything taken down by pencil or recorder at the time. The pundit searched high and low and had to admit the supposed remark was unsourceable. (Look, the Nixon speechwriter was me and the columnist was my current colleague, Tony Lewis; I didn't have to research this.)</p>
        <p>During Ronald Reagan's run for re-election in 1984, Democrats took a leaf from the Romney playbook and charged him with having a secret plan to raise taxes after the election. This forced Reagan to say defensively he would raise taxes only ''as a last resort'' and reminded politicians that the old secret-plan charge had legs.</p>
        <p>Even Gore, a few weeks before he leveled the tried-and-true phrase at Bush, showed he was aware of its old-chestnuttiness. In a hilarious, deadpan, self-mocking speech to the Gridiron Club in Washington, he was widely reported to have said he had a secret plan to win the White House: he would claim credit for all the good stuff that had happened in the past eight years and dissociate himself from the bad stuff.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, George W. Bush has been using an attack word of his own to characterize the Gore approach to Social Security: ''For eight years,'' he wrote in a fund-raising letter, ''Clinton/Gore has had history's greatest opportunity to reform Social Security. They chose to demagogue the problem, not repair it.''</p>
        <p>I kept this letter, sent to me by its recipient, Leila Hadley Luce of New York, to note the use of the beslashed singular subject Clinton/Gore, followed properly by the singular verb has, but then followed incorrectly by they. Clinton/Gore is a team and takes an it.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Luce's covering note questioned the use of the ''new verb,'' to demagogue. Originally a noun, this was formed from the Greek demos, ''people,'' and agogos, ''leading''; it meant ''leader of the mob'' and now has the derogatory meaning of ''a politician who appeals to people's emotions.'' The noun can be used attributively to do the work of an adjective: Robert Southey in 1812 denounced ''the venom and the virulence of the demagogue journalists.''</p>
        <p>Governor Bush cannot be faulted for using demagogue as a verb. It was coined in that form by James Harrington in his 1656 utopian theory, ''Commonwealth of Oceana.'' He picked up the noun coined five years earlier by Thomas Hobbes and wrote of a time ''when that same ranting fellow Alcibiades fell a demagoging for the Sicilian war.'' In 1890, The Cincinnati Commercial Gazette wrote of President Benjamin Harrison, ''The president never thought of demagoging the matter.''</p>
        <p>Note the lack of a u in those usages of what most of us would until recently spell as demagoguing. But we live in a non-U world; just as catalogue and dialogue have been dropping their ue endings, so too will demagogue soon enough be spelled demagog, with its gerund demagoging.</p>
        <p>It's a hard word for the mob to handle; demagogic is pronounced with the final g soft, rhyming with logic, but demagoguery has the final g hard, rhyming with toggery. (Get away from that e-mail key; there is such a word. It means ''clothing.'')</p>
        <p>Will Gore now assail Bush for harboring a secret plan to attack him for demagoguery? Will Bush lash back in a debate by demanding he spell it? Both sides are now armed.</p>
