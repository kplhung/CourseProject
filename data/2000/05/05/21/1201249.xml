        <p>THE crowd parts in front of Lonnie Lopez's golf cart, faces beaming with hope that the editor of Lowrider magazine -- the bible of the Latino-centered customizing movement -- will stop to take a picture. Mr. Lopez, 39, is looking for new talent in the parking lot of the Florida State Fairgrounds, a weekend stop last month on the 15-city Lowrider Boulevard Tour 2000.</p>
        <p>''Yo, yo, Lowrider man!'' a young man in baggy shorts and basketball jersey calls after him. ''What about my ride?'' The youth has a buzz cut and a beard that looks as if it were penciled onto his jaw. He and Mr. Lopez exchange a complicated handshake and a few words in English and Spanish.</p>
        <p>The car is a late 1980's Cadillac Sedan de Ville, painted in an ice-blue metallic -- ''metal flake'' -- with snowy tuck-and-roll upholstery, golden-spoke wheels and a sound system with the power of a public-address system. Outfitted with a hydraulics system in its suspension, the car holds its right front wheel a foot off the ground, like a dog favoring a wounded paw.</p>
        <p>The Cadillac does not quite make the cut. ''Keep working on it, bro,'' Mr. Lopez says. ''I'll be back next year.''</p>
        <p>Lowriding emerged in the 1950's in California, as Mexican-American youths -- in what may have been a reaction to the hot-rod culture dominated by whites -- transformed their cars into fantastical, ground-hugging showboats. ''Go low and go slow'' were the watchwords. From the beginning, lowriding was as much about ethnic identity as about machinery. ''It was a way for the Chicano people to feel pride in who they were, in their way of life,'' Mr. Lopez said.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, lowriding began to break out of its traditionally Latino stronghold, a trend fueled by Mr. Lopez's magazine itself. Lowrider's provocative covers, featuring buxom models in the scantiest of bikinis, had undeniable shelf appeal to young men of all ethnic backgrounds. Lowrider magazine became a multicultural crossover hit.</p>
        <p>Today, Latinos account for only 58 percent of Lowrider's audience, Mr. Lopez said. Fully a quarter of the magazine's readers are white, he said, and the balance are African-American and Asian. While its circulation of 216,000 is low compared with mainstream auto magazines that rely heavily on mail subscriptions, like Motor Trend and Road &amp; Track, it perennially leads the car enthusiast segment in rack sales. Once confined to the West Coast, lowriding, like ''slamming'' -- the high-performance modification of small cars, usually Japanese imports -- has spread east.</p>
        <p>As a measure of mainstream acceptance, when the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles recently staged a lowriders exhibit, museum attendance doubled.</p>
        <p>Whatever gang-life origins the hobby once had have long since disappeared, Mr. Lopez said, leaving only a mildly menacing patina, including the occasional flaming skull or smoking gun motif on the elaborate murals that adorn many of the cars. ''It's a bad-boy image, but it's not a bad-boy sport,'' he said. ''A guy spends $30,000 on a lowrider, the last thing he's going to do is a drive-by.''</p>
        <p>Danny Cortinaz, a member of the Low Lyfe Car Club in Plant City, Fla., said lowriding was actually an alternative to gang life. ''It keeps kids off the streets, gives them something to do,'' said Mr. Cortinaz, 26, festooned with gold chains to match his gold-plated Chevy pickup. His attention strays when two teenagers in miniskirts and halter tops walk by. ''Mostly we do it for the females.''</p>
        <p>While the prototypical lowrider remains a Chevrolet from the early 1960's, hobbyists have surprisingly ecumenical tastes. There are ''oldies'' and ''bombs,'' cars and trucks built before 1955; ''traditionals,'' American cars built from the 1960's through the 1980's; trucks and mini-trucks; and ''euros,'' which, despite that label, are typically compact Japanese cars with oversize wheels and elaborate plastic body cladding that mimics the look of European sports coupes.</p>
        <p>''A lot of young people get into it with newer cars,'' Mr. Lopez said. ''It's a lot more affordable to do a used Honda than a classic car.''</p>
        <p>What is striking -- and poignant -- about the lowriding movement is the tender devotion lavished on what would otherwise be the throwaways of consumer car culture. The clunky detritus of the 1970's and 1980's -- these Monte Carlos, Regals, LeBarons and Bonnevilles -- seem to have won some sort of karmic lottery. Instead of being crushed and forgotten, these cars will live forever in a glitzy state of perpetual recycling.</p>
        <p>The luckiest lowriders become show cars, dramatically ornate and customized vehicles that are all but undrivable. In Tampa, the show cars -- whose owners are often paid to appear at lowrider events -- took up residence inside the fairgrounds arena. Each car was mounted in its own tableau of crushed velvet, mirrors, lights, fog machines and other Vegas-style stagecraft.</p>
        <p>Appearing was Manuel and Carla Corbala's 1979 Cutlass Supreme, ''Strictly Business,'' three-time winner of the ''Lowrider of the Year'' award and a project that cost Mr. Corbala about $80,000. A fantasy in deep purple and fuchsia, the car has had what is known as a frame-off customizing job. All the suspension and undercarriage components have been gold plated, from the control arms to the wheel hubs. All of this work is visible since ''Strictly Business,'' like most of the show cars, sits on gold-plated jack stands over a mirrored floor, its wire wheels removed and arrayed around the car.</p>
        <p>The car's body has been transformed. The roof has been cut out like a targa-top Porsche, known in the hobby as the ''Hollywood'' treatment. The hinges on the doors have been reversed so that they open ''suicide'' style. Both the hood and trunk lid now open to the side, though the hood is removed during shows to give visitors a better view of the engine. The engine block and exhaust headers have been painted in lavender; the valve covers have been gold-plated and engraved with spectacular filigree.</p>
        <p>The original interior of the car is only a memory, replaced by purple velour upholstery and matching swivel chairs, accented with hundreds of mirror tiles. In addition to the exotic hydraulic setup nested in the fully upholstered trunk, Mr. Corbala's lowrider also has the requisite sound system, a 5,000-watt Rockford Fosgate stereo to supply that notorious boulevard ''bump.''</p>
        <p>For many cars in Mr. Corbala's class -- radical custom -- the piece de resistance is mural art. This is an intriguing style of painting: Aztec priests carrying swooning maidens toward a sacrificial altar; dream scapes with Indian shamans, succubi and coiling serpents; Cortez and Quetzalcoatl.</p>
        <p>Yet many of the murals are very intimate and plainly sincere, such as the artwork on Romero Bautista's ''Just a Dream.'' Once an ordinary 1982 Pontiac Grand Prix, the car has metamorphosed into a shrine devoted to the memory of both Selena, the Mexican pop star who was murdered in 1995, and Our Lady of Guadalupe.</p>
        <p>The featured event of lowrider gatherings is the car-hopping contest, where hydraulic-equipped cars compete to see how high they can bounce their wheels off the ground. The contestants stand beside the vehicles, operating the hydraulics with a switch box connected to the car through a cable. Jorge Guzman's 1987 Toyota pickup truck set a world record in the truck hop, with a wheelie 62 inches high, before the truck's gas tank ruptured and the vehicle burst into flame, sending judges and contestants scampering for the fire extinguishers.</p>
        <p>Without exception, each of the cars suffers heavy damage in the course of the competition. Because the hydraulics overheat, fire is a common occurrence. Wheels fall off, hubs shatter and suspensions collapse. As each car disassembles itself in noise and fire, the crowd gets to its feet and cheers.</p>
        <p>''We reinforce them a lot,'' says Armando Nunez, the leader of the hopping team sponsored by Hilow Hydraulics. ''But they don't last too long.''</p>
        <p>And then, a freak accident: during the truck dance competition, a tire explodes, firing a portion of the fractured wheel rim like an artillery shell. It hits the truck's owner, Glen Strickland of Jacksonville, Fla., in the face, dropping him to the concrete floor. His jaw is shattered and he loses some teeth. It takes 15 minutes to summon an ambulance to the arena floor. The festive mood sobers quickly and further competition is canceled.</p>
        <p>An R-rated rap concert ends the show. But the kids themselves don't seem to notice the performers. Many are interested instead in the lowrider bikes and trikes, Schwinns and Huffys given the full lowrider treatment, including custom frames, elaborate gold-plated scrollwork, even hydraulics, TV's, stereos and PlayStations. In time, the kids who own these bikes will trade them in for something faster, and lower.</p>
