        <p>IN the same time that elapsed between the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, the countertenor David Daniels managed to race from New York to London, record Handel's opera ''Rinaldo,'' and make it back for his recital in Princeton tomorrow. The Decca recording was slotted in to follow his last performance (on Derby day) of Handel's ''Giulio Cesare'' at the Metropolitan Opera.</p>
        <p>Because of his unusually high voice range, one would not imagine Mr. Daniels to be in such demand. After all, much of the countertenor repertory comes from the Renaissance and Baroque period. Some was composed for castrato, but physical mutilation of boys has, to say the least, fallen out of favor.

        <p>IN the same time that elapsed between the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, the countertenor David Daniels managed to race from New York to London, record Handel's opera ''Rinaldo,'' and make it back for his recital in Princeton tomorrow. The Decca recording was slotted in to follow his last performance (on Derby day) of Handel's ''Giulio Cesare'' at the Metropolitan Opera.</p>
        <p>Because of his unusually high voice range, one would not imagine Mr. Daniels to be in such demand. After all, much of the countertenor repertory comes from the Renaissance and Baroque period. Some was composed for castrato, but physical mutilation of boys has, to say the least, fallen out of favor. Revival of interest in early music and Baroque opera, however, has put men with a strong high falsetto range, and women who sing male roles, in a good place at a good time.</p>
        <p>As Sesto, son of the murdered Pompey in ''Giulio Cesare,'' Mr. Daniels was sweetly soulful, while the countertenor Brian Asawa sang the devious Ptolomy with a vocal edge, and the mezzo-soprano Jennifer Larmore plowed manfully into the title role. A Handelian orchestra was wondrously flexible and balanced, but flashy coloratura displays came one upon another. Singers needed stamina, and there are no hit tunes.</p>
        <p>With all those midrange voices, plus Stephanie Blythe's in the mezzo role of Sesto's mother, direction became especially important. ''The conductor and director take that in to account,'' Mr. Daniels said, ''and cast people with different timbres and colors. There's no question we all have specific voices. A strong Sesto can steal the show, though I was limited by cuts of two major arias.''</p>
        <p>Regardless of whether countertenor roles are taken by men or by women, the director helps differentiate Sesto from the others through a boyish or even childish manner. ''I played this role at Covent Garden two years ago,'' Mr. Daniels said. ''My face was hairless. The director made me look like a mincing mama's boy, wiping and rubbing my eyes. At the Met, Copley wanted more strength. I don't think Sesto is 12; he's closer to an adult.''</p>
        <p>This role, in which the 34-year-old South Carolina native made his Met debut last year, is his Sesto swan song, because he is turning to the role of Caesar. ''It's probably the last time I'll sing Sesto,'' he said. ''In fact, I know it is. It's not a castrato role. It was written for a woman playing a boy, and it's incredibly high and tiring. I have five more productions as Cesare, and a recording. That's set better for me.''</p>
        <p>Deflecting onto direction and staging, an invitation to compare himself and Ms. Larmore, he said: ''We're physically and vocally different beings. In the first aria, I had a big red staircase to come down, but she had more soldiers around her.''</p>
        <p>The staircase set was part of his first Caesar at the Florida Grand Opera last winter, from which he has another memory, less pleasant. ''A man was standing in the front row, screaming my name,'' he recalled. (That is not uncommon -- Mr. Daniels's supporters are a lively bunch.) At the curtain call the man got around the ushers, dashed onto the stage, handed Mr. Daniels a fan letter and ran away. ''It was scary,'' Mr. Daniels said. ''The rest of the cast hovered around, just in case. I'm upset that the ushers would let that happen.''</p>
        <p>The pianist at tomorrow's recital, Martin Katz, is Marilyn Horne's longtime partner and something of a mentor to Mr. Daniels. He quickly recognized Mr. Daniels's appeal and introduced him to managers at Columbia Artists, as well as to Ms. Horne, with whom he has performed in recital. On tomorrow's program are arias from ''Rinaldo,'' Ms. Horne's signature role. (Coincidentally, Ms. Blythe has elicited some critical hyperventilation about being the next Horne.)</p>
        <p>Tomorrow's collection of Beethoven, Baroque arias, and songs of Brahms and Ravel, is on one of several EMI recordings by Mr. Daniels awaiting release. Called ''Serenade,'' it is available in Europe and due in the United States next month. Mr. Daniels, Musical America's 1999 vocalist of the year, is also vocally suited for the numerous commemorations of Bach's death 250 years ago. He sang the B Minor Mass at the London Proms under Sir Roger Norrington, conductor of his Handel recording.</p>
        <p>The ''Rinaldo'' arias are among the only pieces from the castrato repertory to be heard tomorrow. As to other choices, Mr. Daniels said, ''I won't be limited to Baroque; I'll do whatever seems appropriate.''</p>
        <p>Which raises the question of what 20th-century countertenor repertory actually is. ''Anything we want,'' said Mr. Daniels. ''The fact that I can sing Schubert or Poulenc or Ravel shows that I'm trying to change it. Operatically, I want to stick with Baroque. I have no desire to bleed into the pants roles of Mozart and Strauss, or sing Orlovsky or Baba the Turk. I would love to have repertory written for me. Hopefully, I can work something out.''</p>
        <p>RECITAL  David Daniels, countertenor  Martin Katz, piano.</p>
        <p>McCarter Theater, 91 University Place, Princeton.  Monday, 8 p.m.  (609) 258-2787.</p>
