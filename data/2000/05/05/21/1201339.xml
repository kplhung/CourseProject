        <p>The cat is out of the bag: Your boss knows you use the Internet on the job to shop and to plan your next Club Med vacation. But how is all that surfing affecting your work?</p>
        <p>A new survey has found that nearly 10 percent of employees with Internet access think that their work performance has suffered as a result of the time they spend online. An additional 13 percent blamed the Internet for their inability to stay focused at work. E-mail seems to be a distraction, too. Of the 1,000 people surveyed, 11 percent said they checked their e-mail up to 10 times a day.</p>
        <p>Of course, the vast majority of the respondents said the Internet did not negatively impact their work. Some people forgo a walk during their lunch breaks to use the Internet; 14 percent said they ate at their desks so they could log on.</p>
        <p>Garth Chouteau, a spokesman for Pogo.com, an online games service that commissioned the survey, said the findings suggested that people ''need rest and relaxation while they are at work.''</p>
        <p>''If someone is taking a 10-minute break to play solitaire, that may, in fact, be valuable.''</p>
