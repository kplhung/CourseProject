        <p>Ellen Wright is far from an old-timer. She didn't spend her first summer in the Hamptons until 1971.</p>
        <p>But it didn't take long for her to conclude that it was the place she wanted to call home, a home for all seasons.</p>
        <p>She's written a love letter, of sorts, to the place where shore and sky meet, in a new cookbook ''Bridgehampton Weekends, Easy Menus for Casual Entertaining,'' which is being published next month by William McMorrow.</p>
        <p>The book, illustrated with photographs by Tom Ecklerle, starts where summer ends for many people: on Labor Day, for a dinner for four that features pan-grilled veal chops, a puree of lima beans and peas. Another fall offering, sesame short ribs with tortillas, makes me yearn for a cool day even before I have been sated with summer sunshine. Which is not to say that the summer menus don't sound enticing, with their lavish use of the season's freshest fruits and vegetables.</p>
        <p>These are not recipes designed to show off ingredients that are showing up for their brief 15 minutes of fame. A handful of fresh cilantro leaves is just about as exotic as it gets. Ms. Wright, a long-time assistant to James Beard, has written a book for cooks, hosts and hostesses who want to get back to the basics of entertaining: good food and good friends.</p>
