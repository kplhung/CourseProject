        <p>BY now you know what happened at Daphne's wedding (or if, in fact, it took place) on the season's last episode of ''Frasier.'' And just where Ross, Rachel, Chandler and Monica stand in their relationships on ''Friends,'' at least until fall.

        <p>BY now you know what happened at Daphne's wedding (or if, in fact, it took place) on the season's last episode of ''Frasier.'' And just where Ross, Rachel, Chandler and Monica stand in their relationships on ''Friends,'' at least until fall. But there are an abundance of season finales this week too - with the promise of a couple of weddings, at least one divorce, a political scandal at Gracie Mansion and one very scary baby sitter. Here are a few of the episodes ahead.</p>
        <p>DAWSON'S CREEK. What is the matter with Joey Potter, the cutest girl at Capeside High School? Is Dawson, brooding pretty boy and future filmmaker, not her true love after all? Is it Dawson's best friend, the conflicted and sexually experienced Pacey, instead? Joey absolutely will make a choice in this episode, the producers say. Meanwhile Jen, reformed bad girl, wants to see Henry, whom she used to consider a big loser, one last time - so Andie and her brother, Jack (she's mentally unstable; he's gay and lonely) are willing to drive all night to make it happen. And somebody is getting married. The producers won't say who, just that it's not any of the teenage characters, so Dawson's estranged parents could be giving it another try.</p>
        <p>Wednesday, 8 p.m., WB, with James Van Der Beek (Dawson), Katie Holmes (Joey), Joshua Jackson (Pacey), Michelle Williams (Jen), Michael Pitt (Henry), Meredith Monroe (Andie), Kerr Smith (Jack).</p>
        <p>EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND. This series has made a tradition of doing flashback season finales. Last year it was the day Ray and Debra met. This year the subject is Robert, Ray's insecure policeman brother, and why he and his ex-wife, Joanne, broke up (something to do with his peculiar habits, like touching food to his chin before eating it). In the present, Robert has been out of commission since he was gored by a bull at a rodeo in Queens. Now he's going back to work, but at the family dinner to celebrate his return, he sees Joanne at the restaurant and begins to think about her. At the end she leaves her business card. Will he call? Or will he stay with his current sweet-heart of a girlfriend, Amy?</p>
        <p>Monday, 9 p.m., CBS, with Ray Romano (Raymond), Patricia Heaton (Debra), Brad Garrett (Robert), Doris Roberts (Marie), Suzie Plakson (Joanne), Monica Horan (Amy).</p>
        <p>LAW AND ORDER. Detectives Briscoe and Green learn that an old man who has just been found dead had been investigating the United States military's possible involvement in his son's death during the 1973 revolution in Chile. Assistant District Attorney Jack McCoy goes to the Supreme Court, determined to prosecute the young man's killer. The trick is that the murderer is a high-level foreign dignitary.</p>
        <p>Wednesday, 10 p.m., NBC, with Sam Waterston (McCoy), Jerry Orbach, (Briscoe), Jesse L. Martin (Green).</p>
        <p>MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE. When your mother's management style could be compared to George Patton's, it's unlikely that a little boy would fear a mere baby sitter. But that was before the people behind ''Malcolm'' hired Bea Arthur for this guest appearance. Ms. Arthur takes care of Dewey while the rest of the family goes to a local water park. Meanwhile Francis, the deliquent older brother, away at military school in Alabama, gets serious about playing pool.</p>
        <p>Sunday, 8:30 p.m., Fox, with Frankie Muniz (Malcolm), Jane Kaczmarek (Lois), Brian Cranston (Hal), Erik Per Sullivan(Dewey), Christopher Masterson (Francis), Justin Berfield (Reese).</p>
        <p>THE PRACTICE. Lawyers in love. Bobby and Lindsay get married. Meanwhile Ellenor is playing the sympathy card in court, defending a deaf woman who may have been justified in her crime (the producers won't reveal yet what the crime is), but the Assistant D.A. is playing hardball. The episode title, ''Life Sentence,'' is probably a comment on the wedding, not the trial.</p>
        <p>Sunday, 10 p.m., ABC, with Dylan McDermott (Bobby), Kelli Williams (Lindsay), Camryn Manheim (Ellenor).</p>
        <p>THE SIMPSONS. They've had their own hit series for 10 years. Their faces are on merchandise from T-shirts to mouse pads. How could the Simpson family from Springfield remain the down-to-earth, unspoiled small-town folks they once were? Well, they haven't, and the finale plays homage to VH1's ''Behind the Music'' series with a backstage look at Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and baby Maggie - an how fame, money and partying with supermodels tore them apart. Apparently Quincy Jones brought them back together. (And you thought ''The Brady Bunch'' had great behind-the-scenes dirt.)</p>
        <p>Sunday, 8 p.m., Fox, with the voices of Dan Castellaneta (Homer), Julie Davner (Marge), Nancy Cartwright (Bart) and Yeardley Smith (Lisa).</p>
        <p>SPIN CITY. Everybody knows Michael J. Fox is leaving the series after four seasons, but how will his character - New York's boyish bachelor deputy mayor, Michael Flaherty - make his departure? Shocking but true: Mike has to take the fall for a mob scandal in Mayor Randall Winston's administration. But before Mike goes, he and his co-worker Caitlin Moore declare their love and ''take their relationship to the next level,'' say the producers. Michael Gross, who played Mr. Fox's politically wistful father on ''Family Ties,'' makes a guest appearance.</p>
        <p>Wednesday, 9 p.m., ABC, with Michael J. Fox (Flaherty), Barry Bostwick (Mayor Winston), Heather Locklear (Moore).</p>
        <p>THIRD ROCK FROM THE SUN. The episode title says it all: ''The Big Giant Head Returns Again.'' Redundant but welcome. That means a visit from William Shatner, who - as the Ohio space aliens' boss from another planet - may have found the only other acting role he'll be remembered for. Mr. Shatner's character (the B.G.H.) and Jan Hooks's were newlyweds when last seen. Now they make a surprise visit to earth and the honeymoon is decidedly over. Everyone else's love life seems in upheaval too. That includes Dick and Mary, who are ordered by the big Giant Head to break up. Chyna, a World Wrestling Federation celebrity, is the guest star.</p>
        <p>Tuesday, 8 p.m., NBC, with John Lithgow (Dick), Jane Curtin (Mary), Kristen Johnston (Sally), French Stewart (Harry), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Tommy).</p>
        <p>WILL AND GRACE. How long can you keep Gregory Hines as a recurring character on a series and not let him dance? He had a tap competition with Jack earlier this month. Now he waltzes Grace across a conference table and straight into a romantic encounter, which Will (who works for him) finds out about. Jack - the gayest man in America, who, as viewers will recall, married Karen's maid, Rosario, for green card reasons - is being asked for a divorce. Seems Rosario is in love with the gardener. Somehow this will all result in a change in living arrangements for some of the series' key players.</p>
        <p>Tuesday, 9 p.m., NBC, with Gregory Hines (Ben), Sean hayes (Jack), Debra Messing (Grace), Eric McCormack (Will), Megan Mullally (Karen), Shelley Morrison (Rosario).</p>
        <p>THE X-FILES. in ''Requiem'' (For the season? For the series? At press time this was still undecided), Fox Mulder and Dana Scully look back - at the case that brought them together: alien abductions in Oregon. And as if life weren't difficult enough for the F.B.I.'s most glamorous special agents, their expense reports are called into question. Accounting probably finally noticed that visit to Antarctica.</p>
        <p>Sunday, 9 p.m., Fox, with David Duchovny (Mulder), Gillian Anderson (Scully).</p>
