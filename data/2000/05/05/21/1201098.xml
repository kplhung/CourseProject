        <p>Have Steamers Will Travel</p>
        <p>Rent a chef. It's less than $6 an hour.</p>
        <p>If you love the idea of fresh seafood cooked au naturel, but cringe at the idea of hauling wood around and eating food laced with sand, try a clambake in your backyard. Jim Sanford, a classically trained chef with 30 years of clam-baking experience, will bring all the food, utensils and his own specially designed equipment to your home to cook up an authentic-tasting beach barbecue for about $5.70 an hour.</p>

        <p>Have Steamers Will Travel</p>
        <p>Rent a chef. It's less than $6 an hour.</p>
        <p>If you love the idea of fresh seafood cooked au naturel, but cringe at the idea of hauling wood around and eating food laced with sand, try a clambake in your backyard. Jim Sanford, a classically trained chef with 30 years of clam-baking experience, will bring all the food, utensils and his own specially designed equipment to your home to cook up an authentic-tasting beach barbecue for about $5.70 an hour.</p>
        <p>The catch? That price is a per-person estimate based on Mr. Sanford's being at your house for about seven hours (he needs three hours of prep and set-up time) and cooking for a minimum of 40 people at $40 a person (he can cook for up to 1,000 guests), so his services are best for a big party. The guests get their own lobster and all the steamers, corn, onions, potatoes, chicken, barbecue sauce, smoked sausage, watermelon and coffee they can put away.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sanford, a Mount Vernon resident, opened the business in 1970 on Martha's Vineyard and moved it to New York in 1980.</p>
        <p>''When I started this, you'd think you could get anything in New York if you had the money,'' he said. ''You could get a pink elephant at 4 in the morning, but you couldn't get an authentic clambake.''</p>
        <p>Authentic is the operative word. Mr. Sanford arrives with his goods packed in rockweed, and everything is steamed under canvas, which is the traditional way (and, if you forgo the butter, makes a low fat meal).</p>
        <p>Call Mr. Sanford at (212) 865-8976, 205 West 95th Street, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>It's Splashdown Time</p>
        <p>Rent-a-thrill for 38 cents.</p>
        <p>If it's deadly hot and the thought of frying on a beach just makes you hotter, consider sliding down 300 feet of cool, wet plastic and landing in a pool below. The Zoom Flume Water Park in East Durham, N.Y., is about two hours from the Tappan Zee Bridge -- as close as most beaches.</p>
        <p>The water park has nine ''rides'' that will soak you and your children, including a 10,000-gallon-a-minute Wild River for ''white water rafting.'' (For the very young, there is a mini-slide where children glide  down the beak of a large, friendly looking pelican into a shallow pool.)</p>
        <p>The manager, Ed Kerrigan, said the biggest thrill for your money is the Canyon Plunge, which involves lying on your back and sliding down a steep, 40-foot incline into another pool.</p>
        <p>The park is open daily from June 24 through Labor Day (in the rain, the rides close if there is any threat of lightning), and there are lots of places to eat</p>
        <p>Zoom Flume's admission -- $16.95, $13.95 for children under 8 --is good for a day of unlimited rides. Taking the adult price, and figuring on a five-hour visit, the tab comes to less than 40 cents per thrill. Discount coupons are also available.</p>
        <p>Call (518) 239-4559 for directions. Or visit the Web site at www.zoomflume.com.</p>
        <p>For Pedal Pushers</p>
        <p>Rent some exercise; it only costs pennies.</p>
        <p>For 45 cents an hour, you can rent a 10-speed bike from Danny's Cycles in Scarsdale. (That's at the weekly rental rate of $75 for seven days. You can rent for the day at $25, which isn't bad, at about $1.04 an hour.)</p>
        <p>You can take the bikes anywhere. Danny's even rents car-ready bike racks for $10 a day. Danny Christesen, the owner, has all kinds of bikes -- mountain, hybrid and ''comfort'' -- which he describes as a ''new style, old-fashioned bike,'' as in the kind you remember from childhood but with fancy gears. Most bikes are made by Raleigh and Trek. All rentals include a helmet. Danny's also rents small bikes that will fit a teenager, but none specially made for children.</p>
        <p>Danny's Cycles, 644 Central Avenue, Scarsdale. (914) 723-3408.</p>
        <p>Telling Tales</p>
        <p>Rent a storyteller for 78 cents an hour.</p>
        <p>You're driving to Maine. Or East Hampton. Or any faraway place that involves miles of traffic. Wouldn't it be great to transport yourself -- just briefly -- into a snowy winter where a passionate Russian nobleman risks his life to be by your side? Rent the book ''Dr. Zhivago'' on an audio tape and you're there for less than 80 cents an hour.</p>
        <p>Chivers Audio Books in Hampton, N.H., has thousands of titles that will occupy your journeys to vacationland and pass the time while you're lying there, dreaming on the beach. The British-based company rents English mysteries, the entire P. G. Wodehouse collection of Jeeves books, Dick Francis's horse-racing stories and classics read by British actors like Kenneth Branagh.</p>
        <p>Boris Pasternak's ''Dr. Zhivago,'' read by Philip Madoc, is $15.50 for 16 75-minute tapes. Michael Palin's Full Circle travelogue, a 10-cassette series, is available for $12.50. Considering that the cost for buying a six-cassette item is about $55, Chivers's rentals are a bargain.</p>
        <p>Among the most popular titles now is ''Captain Corelli's Mandolin'' by Louis de Bernieres. Read by the British actor Michael Maloney, it centers on a young and highly musical Italian officer stationed in the Greek Islands in World War II and rents for $14.50 for 14 cassettes.</p>
        <p>Chivers has an 80-page catalog available by calling (800) 704-2005.</p>
        <p>Rent James Bond's Life</p>
        <p>For about $35 an hour you can pretend you're a movie star, a captain of industry or the kind of person who drives a Ferrari Spider F355 to East Hampton for a weekend.</p>
        <p>At Exotic Car Rentals, the fleet includes bright yellow Hummer convertibles, Jaguar convertibles, Porsches and, of course, Ferraris.</p>
        <p>''Live your fantasy,'' suggests the company Web site (www.exoticrentals.net). At $800 a day for the most expensive vehicle, you'll need a certain amount of wherewithal -- and gumption -- to do so. (For those under 25, there are added charges.) But consider this bargain: a black Bentley Brookland, which rents for $499 a day. With a three-day minimum, that's about $1,500 for 72 hours, or about $20 an hour.</p>
        <p>You need not consider yourself a wannabe just because you want the experience of driving a celebrity-caliber car. A number of superstars have been known to frequent the rental house. Kelsey Grammar is a customer, as is Matt Dillon and -- before he was Tony Soprano -- James Gandolfini sometimes stopped in. ''He was a very down-to-earth guy,'' Melena Montana, the manager, said. ''But I doubt he'd come by himself now to pick up a car. He's too important.''</p>
        <p>The company is in Greenwich Village, but they'll deliver anywhere for the right price.  Call Exotic Car Rentals at (212) 633-1191.</p>
        <p>Inside the Great Outdoors</p>
        <p>Rent that back-to-nature feeling (without too much suffering) for $65 a day.</p>
        <p>At Croton Point Park in Croton-on-Hudson, a stunningly beautiful finger of land pointing into the Hudson River, four people can rent a deluxe cabin with stove, running water and indoor toilet for a total of $65 a day, or $275 a week.</p>
        <p>Not bad, considering that most resorts will charge at least double that for one person (and they won't allow your dog to come along, either). If you like your nature a bit rougher, there are less deluxe cabins for $45 a day and tent sites for $15. Camping for canoeists and kayakers along the river's edge is also available. An enticement: campers at Croton Point Park get exclusive use of a swimming pool.</p>
        <p>Croton Point Park also has a sandy beach where it has been considered safe to swim since 1996, as well as miles of trails for hiking and jogging.</p>
        <p>Campers (or day visitors) can also fish, bird watch and butterfly chase in a large meadow filled with wildflowers.</p>
        <p>Call (914) 271-3293 for directions and more information.</p>
