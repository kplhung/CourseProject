        <p>FOR most of us, beachfront property translates into that patch of sand where, for a fee paid at the guard's gate or in local taxes, we feather a waterside nest with appropriate creature comforts and settle in for a few precious hours. Everybody has developed their own set of beach rituals. Some go early, and stay all day. Others arrive late afternoon and watch the sun set and the moon rise. Some go to the same beach, same spot, year after year. You can hear cards being shuffled and dealt to a foursome sitting cross-legged on a beach blanket, or you can hear salsa music throbbing from a tape player off in the distance that gets your hips moving in your beach chair. Cooler lids pop on and off throughout the day. Grills sizzle. The water's music is moderate, no crashing surf along the gentle Sound, just a pedal-point of  water lapping, a little more loudly when a boat passes or the tide comes in.</p>
        <p>First things first. Before relaxing with the latest steamy novel, or baiting a hook for a little fishing off the rocks to catch a blue or striper, you have got to set up house. My earliest beachgoing recollections are of the Jersey Shore, where my mother, with us kids in tow, led the way with the large umbrella pointing forward as though she were about to joust. She would stop at the perfect spot, and like the heroine in a vampire movie, plunge the pointed end of the umbrella into the sand. Then came the chairs, the beach blanket and the sun-tan lotion.</p>

        <p>FOR most of us, beachfront property translates into that patch of sand where, for a fee paid at the guard's gate or in local taxes, we feather a waterside nest with appropriate creature comforts and settle in for a few precious hours. Everybody has developed their own set of beach rituals. Some go early, and stay all day. Others arrive late afternoon and watch the sun set and the moon rise. Some go to the same beach, same spot, year after year. You can hear cards being shuffled and dealt to a foursome sitting cross-legged on a beach blanket, or you can hear salsa music throbbing from a tape player off in the distance that gets your hips moving in your beach chair. Cooler lids pop on and off throughout the day. Grills sizzle. The water's music is moderate, no crashing surf along the gentle Sound, just a pedal-point of  water lapping, a little more loudly when a boat passes or the tide comes in.</p>
        <p>First things first. Before relaxing with the latest steamy novel, or baiting a hook for a little fishing off the rocks to catch a blue or striper, you have got to set up house. My earliest beachgoing recollections are of the Jersey Shore, where my mother, with us kids in tow, led the way with the large umbrella pointing forward as though she were about to joust. She would stop at the perfect spot, and like the heroine in a vampire movie, plunge the pointed end of the umbrella into the sand. Then came the chairs, the beach blanket and the sun-tan lotion.</p>
        <p>Our territory had been established.</p>
        <p>The basics of umbrella, chairs, towels and cooler remain intact. But these days the cooler has wheels and a flip-open table top. Chairs have carrying straps. Sunglasses are polarized. Acrylic cups are more acceptable than paper. More and more of the comforts of home find their way under the umbrella: a portable blender promises fresher daiquiris; water-resistant boomboxes and personal CD players ensure Handel's ''Water Music'' won't get soggy. And what looks like a direct hit against winter's endless days of gray, this year's beach equipment is a riot of defiant color. Silver, with its reflective quality and nod to shimmering fish scales, is a high-tech neutral that looks good with everything.</p>
        <p>But problems arise when your space on the beach is violated, usually when somebody steps over you, coating you with sand like a breaded chicken breast thanks to the adhering properties of your sunblock. Dorothy Knobel Somogyi of Knobel Brothers Hardware in Darien has the answer: Seymour Stripe marking paint in red/orange fluorescent ($4.70). Typically used to mark dead trees, it works beautifully on sand. With an inverted nozzle, it is meant to be sprayed upside down. The creative possibilities are endless.</p>
        <p>And the color is very in this year.</p>
