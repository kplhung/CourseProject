        <p>FOR die-hard theatergoers -- the kind of devoted fans who gnawed their cuticles over the battle between ''Dreamgirls'' and ''Nine'' in 1982, or agonized over which actor from ''Two Trains Running,'' Laurence Fishburne or Roscoe Lee Browne, to root for in 1992, or pulled for ''Pacific Overtures'' to upset the popular favorite, ''A Chorus Line,'' in 1976 -- the Tony Awards have been as exciting as the Oscars.</p>
        <p>And here it is again, that theatrical rite of spring: Tony time, when this season's actors, directors, playwrights, choreographers and designers get to enjoy their brief anointed status as nominees, and producers can salivate about the prospect of being able to plaster ''Best Musical'' or ''Best Play'' above the titles of their shows and hear their box office cash registers go ka-ching.</p>
        <p>Many theater professionals say the Tony Awards are a prestigious prize that celebrates Broadway's talent and sells Broadway shows, and that the awards' marketing power is potent, particularly on the road.</p>
        <p>But these same professionals concede that Tony season has also become an annual opportunity for carping and soul-searching within the industry, not only about the theater but also about the Tonys themselves. This year, the debates seem to point to a fundamental shift in the conception of what constitutes live theater on Broadway.</p>
        <p>The controversy over whether ''Contact,'' a dance show with no singing or live music, should be considered a musical goes to the heart of a larger question about the direction of the American musical. The three other shows besides ''Contact'' nominated for best musical this year also defy conventional definitions. ''James Joyce's 'The Dead,' '' which recently closed, is a play in which the characters sing Irish songs for one another at a Christmas party. ''Swing!'' is a dance revue that mixes classic swing music with new pastiche pieces. And Michael John LaChiusa's ''Wild Party,'' like his other new musical this season, ''Marie Christine,'' features virtually no dialogue at all, blurring the lines between musical theater and opera.</p>
        <p>Indeed, this year's Tony Awards suggest a rejection of the traditional book musical, given that Disney's ''Aida'' was not nominated for best musical, although it received five other nominations.</p>
        <p>The nominators were apparently hard pressed to fill out the category for best musical revival, nominating ''Tango Argentino,'' a dance show, which has closed, and ''Jesus Christ Superstar,'' which received almost universally poor reviews, in addition to Cole Porter's ''Kiss Me, Kate'' and Meredith Willson's ''Music Man.''</p>
        <p>Two members of the Tony nominating committee resigned this year. A. R. Gurney, the playwright, said he resigned because he was not permitted to abstain from the vote on whether Mandy Patinkin should be nominated for best actor in a musical. Mr. Patinkin had been absent from the performance Mr. Gurney attended of ''The Wild Party.'' ''I just didn't think it was fair to vote for or against him if I hadn't seen him,'' Mr. Gurney said. (The playwright elaborates on his concerns about the Tonys in an article on page 9.)</p>
        <p>Jack Goldstein, the executive director of the Theater Development Fund, resigned over objections to ''Contact's'' being considered a musical.</p>
        <p>Some nominators expressed frustration that they were unable to award something special to the two actors who alternate roles in ''True West,'' Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly. Even though the nominators had taken the trouble to see both versions of the production, they said they were forced to vote for best actor based only on the play's opening night casting.</p>
        <p>''They're both superb and they both share the play,'' said Frances Sternhagen, the actress, who serves on the nominating committee. ''So why do we have to have this rule?</p>
        <p>''Theater so needs a boost that you don't want to be difficult,'' Ms. Sternhagen continued. ''But it's just so hard when you want to give credit where credit is due.''</p>
        <p>The Tonys this year also had to grapple with the notion of what is a Broadway show. For example, ''Dame Edna: The Royal Tour'' and ''Jackie Mason: Much Ado About Everything'' were deemed ineligible despite their popularity with audiences. One way the Tony administrators have handled unorthodox shows is to give them special Tony Awards, as they did this year with ''Dame Edna.''</p>
        <p>The nominations this year also speak to the dearth of new writing on Broadway. Two revivals -- ''Kiss Me, Kate'' and ''The Music Man'' -- led the nominations, with 12 and 8 respectively. Two of the four productions nominated for best new play are actually old, though they are new to Broadway: ''True West'' by Sam Shepard was originally produced Off Broadway in 1980, and ''The Ride Down Mt. Morgan'' by Arthur Miller was first produced in London in 1991. Similarly, Noel Coward's ''Waiting in the Wings'' is eligible for consideration as best new play because it has never before been on Broadway, even though it was written in 1960.</p>
        <p>Despite various complaints about the selection process, most people associated with New York theater agree that the Tonys are no more problematic than any other awards show in which an industry honors itself.</p>
        <p>Although there are many other theater awards given out around this time -- the Outer Critics Circle Awards, the Obies, the Drama Desk Awards and the Drama League Awards -- producers say the Tonys are the only ones that sell tickets. Winning best musical or best play, they say, means money in the bank.</p>
        <p>''To win a Tony is a powerful calling card,'' said Rocco Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters.</p>
        <p>Added Emanuel Azenberg, the producer: ''It's industry-created to hype an industry. And in that it succeeds.''</p>
        <p>But what exactly is that industry these days? Since Broadway has become dominated by revivals and British imports, is some of the best work happening elsewhere? And what exactly are the Tony Awards intended for? To honor the best of New York theater generally, or to promote Broadway specifically?</p>
        <p>Last year, the League of American Theaters and Producers, the national trade organization for the commercial theater industry, which presents the Tony Awards with the American Theater Wing, established a long-range planning committee to examine the future of the league, including Tony matters.</p>
        <p>''I'm in the thinking stage on all this right now,'' said Elizabeth I. McCann, a longtime producer who serves on the committee. ''You have to look at the season as it plays itself out. You can't force it into rigid rules that were created when theater was different.</p>
        <p>''I would like an impartial panel of three people who would view the situation and make recommendations to the committee based on this season on Broadway,'' Ms. McCann continued. ''Why jam 'Riverdance' into the category of best musical when it is really basically a dance revue?'' The show had been termed eligible by the Tony administration committee, though it did not receive a nomination from the Tony nominating committee.</p>
        <p>When producers want to get actors or shows considered for certain Tony nominations, they must petition the Tony administration committee. This year the producers of ''True West'' petitioned to have Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Reilly considered jointly so they would not compete against each other for a nomination in the leading actor category. The request was denied. In another case, the producers of ''A Moon for the Misbegotten'' asked that Roy Dotrice, who plays the heroine's father, be considered in the featured actor rather than the leading actor category. That request was granted.</p>
        <p>Such efforts notwithstanding, Jed Bernstein, president of the league, said the process generally worked. ''It's easy to take potshots at individual rules and individual outcomes,'' he said. ''But once you start to understand the ultimate goal -- that there ought to be a level playing field -- whether it's right or wrong, at least it's fair.''</p>
        <p>Some producers beg to differ. Since 1994, Roy Gabay has produced, or been general manager for, three Pulitzer Prize-winning plays -- ''Three Tall Women,''  ''How I Learned to Drive'' and ''Wit'' -- all Off Broadway, none Tony eligible. ''That to me is wrong,'' Mr. Gabay said. ''I don't understand how that can be, that plays that were honored for excellence in the theater are not eligible for an excellence award.''</p>
        <p>The Off Broadway industry itself has in the past resisted the idea of becoming Tony-eligible because of logistical and financial obstacles. Trying to get all the Tony voters into the multitude of small Off Broadway houses to see every production would be almost impossible. In addition, it could drive up the costs of producing, due to the loss of revenue that would result from having to give away seats to Tony voters, and because the unions might then demand Broadway rates -- or at least a higher wage scale -- for their services.</p>
        <p>Some theater executives suggested creating a few Off Broadway Tony Awards and appointing a special Off Broadway Tony committee so that every voter would not have to see every Off Broadway show. ''I don't know if it's feasible,'' said Daryl Roth, an Off Broadway producer who has also produced on Broadway. ''But it feels like the right thing to do and where we're heading.''</p>
        <p>Because Off Broadway productions are excluded from the Tonys, Ms. Roth said they miss out on national exposure during the Tony Awards show. This is particularly critical to productions that can barely afford their own marketing. Broadway producers often counter that Off Broadway has its own prizes. But others say these do not have the prestige of the Tonys in terms of what they can do for a show's fortunes and a performer's reputation.</p>
        <p>''Careers change when they get a Tony Award,'' said Virginia P. Louloudes, the executive director of the Alliance of Resident Theaters/New York, a service group for nonprofit theaters. ''And God knows, the actors deserve the recognition. So do the directors and designers.''</p>
        <p>What it comes down to, it seems, is what the Tonys are really about. ''If the point of the awards is to promote Broadway, then keeping Off Broadway out of the awards is appropriate,'' said Todd Haimes, artistic director of the Roundabout Theater Company, an Off Broadway house that also produces on Broadway. ''If the point is to award excellence in the theater in the New York metropolitan area, then to keep Off Broadway out is ridiculous.''</p>
        <p>Broadway executives say the Tony is not an equal-opportunity perk; it is reserved for those foolhardy enough and financially able to gamble on Broadway. Big risks, this argument goes, deserve the biggest potential reward.</p>
        <p>''No business is going to give away its franchise for nothing,'' said Mr. Landesman, the producer. ''Would Rolls-Royce say, 'Here's our emblem, go put it on a Chevy?' I don't see why we're expected to do that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gabay said the major flaw of the Tonys was who rules on eligibility. ''You're looking at people with completely vested interests,'' he said about the 24 members of the Tony administration committee. ''It's not a group of people who can make a fair decision. They are theater owners, they are producers. Why would I want 'Wit' to be eligible when I'm producing 'Art' or 'The Beauty Queen of Leenane'?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gabay said that when a producer appears before the administration committee to argue his case, as he has, the deck is stacked. ''You feel like you're just going through the motions,'' he said, ''because it's completely political in there.''</p>
        <p>Producers who serve on the committee defend the selection process, saying, essentially, welcome to the real world. ''Is it any different in this industry from the television industry or the recording industry or the film industry?'' asked Barry Weissler, who, with his wife, Fran, has produced several of Broadway's biggest hit revivals. ''It's the same. Everyone has self-interest.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Azenberg, the producer, said, the Tonys make no pretense of being about which artist or project is better than another; it isn't like winning a track meet because you ran the fastest. ''We have an artificial competition,'' he said. ''Shows don't compete. It's just a subjective choice between people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bernstein, of the league, pointed out that many of those who criticize certain rules are not prepared to present viable alternatives. Some people in the industry, for example, have objected to considering ''True West'' a new production because, although it was written in 1980 and produced Off Broadway, the play has never been produced on Broadway. But then, Mr. Bernstein asked, what does the definition of a new play become? A production that was never done in New York City but might have been done in Connecticut or New Jersey? A play that has never been given an ''important production''? And if that is the case, what defines important?</p>
        <p>As to what constitutes a musical, that appears to be up for grabs these days. With shows like ''Smokey Joe's Cafe,''  ''Fosse,'' ''Riverdance,''  ''Swing!,''  ''Contact'' and ''James Joyce's 'The Dead' '' stretching the boundaries of a traditional book musical, it is hard to know what a musical is anymore.</p>
        <p>SOME theater professionals suggested creating more specific categories, along the lines of London's Olivier Awards or Hollywood's Golden Globes -- like Tonys for best solo performance or best entertainment -- though this would mean more to squeeze into the already crowded broadcast.</p>
        <p>Then there are those who argue that there are not enough voters with the appropriate expertise in each category, like craftspeople who can judge design. But critics of this idea caution that the voting pool is already bloated and adding voters is not the answer.</p>
        <p>''I think there are too many people voting,'' Mr. Azenberg said. ''You can't get a lifetime franchise by producing one play. Some of us still want to be judged by our peers.'' He said he had given Tony voters $125,000 worth of tickets to ''The Iceman Cometh,'' which he produced last year in a limited run starring Kevin Spacey (who was also a producer of the play). ''If I'm going to do a play for 12 to 14 weeks, that's giving away 25 percent of the potential profit if the play is successful,'' Mr. Azenberg said. (''Iceman'' orchestra tickets were $100.)</p>
        <p>With increasing numbers of new people dabbling in Broadway, ''it will get out of hand,'' he warned. ''It is out of hand.''</p>
        <p>Two years ago, the league stepped up its enforcement of a policy mandating that only producers who have produced a show in the previous four years could remain active members and therefore have a Tony vote, though they may retain their league membership -- a decision that angered several voters, about 30 of whom have drafted a complaint against the league that has been sent out to members of the group for approval. This reduced the number of Tony voters from 825 to 705, a figure that will jump slightly, because the league recently lengthened the required time period within which someone must have produced to six years and decided to create a new lifetime membership category for inactive theater veterans to honor their service.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, there are still a lot of voters, each of whom is entitled to a pair of tickets per show, which amounts to a potential loss of about $100,000 for each production. Moreover, many producers complain that some voters give their tickets away but cast their votes nonetheless -- a violation of rules that producers nevertheless feel unable to enforce without alienating voters.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to be offensive and cost myself a vote,'' Mr. Gabay said. ''Will they get really annoyed and not vote for me if I put the screws in?''</p>
        <p>When the Tonys were created by the American Theater Wing in 1947, the ceremony took place at the Waldorf-Astoria. The award consisted of a scroll and women got a monogrammed sterling silver compact; men a cigarette lighter or an engraved gold money clip. Some people miss the old days.</p>
        <p>''I enjoy the intimacy and the feeling of family in the ballroom that we had then,'' said Isabelle Stevenson, chairwoman of the American Theater Wing.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stevenson makes no secret of her belief that the Tonys have become too concerned with commercial interests. ''The Tony Award was created to reward excellence in the theater,'' she said.''There was no thought of it being of economic value.</p>
        <p>''You can't be blind to the fact that it is an important economic boost to the theater. On the other hand, it cannot become just that. The commitment to excellence must remain. You cannot use it only as an economic marketing tool.''</p>
        <p>Even those who believe that bigger is better for the Tonys complain that the show has not found its own identity. ''If you're going to go on network television, you're going to try to ape the Oscars and use what happens on television to sell tickets,'' said Ms. McCann, the producer. ''It's a tough problem for the theater to compete against the Emmys, the Grammys, the Oscars. Yet CBS expects us to.''</p>
        <p>With ratings a struggle, and Broadway actors radiating considerably less star power than movie actors -- with the exception of actors who visit Broadway from Hollywood -- the pressure has increased to make the Tony Awards show more of a draw for viewers (the first hour is broadcast on PBS, the second two hours on CBS).</p>
        <p>Thus, it has now become not just an advantage but something of a necessity to present the awards at a glitzy location like Radio City Music Hall rather than in a theater or ballroom, and to have Rosie O'Donnell as host. (When she did not appear last year, the overnight ratings dropped considerably -- to 7.9 from the 10.3 when she presided in 1998.)</p>
        <p>Some industry insiders say the awards have become overly concerned with the promotion potential and star power of the television show rather than simply with honoring outstanding work.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sternhagen, who is in the second of her three-year term as a Tony nominator, said the Tony administrators expressed disappointment last year when she and her colleagues failed to nominate Nicole Kidman for her performance in ''The Blue Room,'' because the movie star would have boosted television ratings.</p>
        <p>Nominators said they were frustrated by having to nominate a certain number of musicals to satisfy the CBS contract that specifies a minimum of seven ''entertainment segments'' on the Tony broadcast. Some suggested featuring musical numbers without having to nominate the musicals.</p>
        <p>Then there is the ''damned if you do, damned if you don't'' problem of honoring straight plays on the broadcast. When they are excluded, some argue that the awards do not reflect the true picture of a Broadway season. But producers have yet to come up with an effective way to feature straight plays; last year's delivery by Mr. Spacey and several other actors of a montage of lines from various plays was widely criticized as a mishmash.</p>
        <p>''The wing is concerned with excellence,'' Ms. McCann said. ''Broadway producers are concerned with selling tickets. So everybody has a different agenda for that show.''</p>
        <p>Although some people in the theater worry that CBS may drop the Tonys because of low ratings, Leslie Moonves, the network's president and chief executive, said CBS remained committed. ''I still think the Tony Awards is one of the most prestigious events on television,'' he said. And, he added, ''We have some very loyal sponsors who feel the way we do.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, William F. Baker, president of New York's WNET, said he was proud to carry the PBS presentation of behind-the-scenes awards (i.e., costumes, lighting) ''to celebrate and provide an understanding about the people who create the plays and are in some ways unsung heroes.''</p>
        <p>Winning a Tony is still a significant achievement in the industry, producers say. Even Peter Schneider, chairman of Disney Studios -- which would hardly seem to need a Broadway award to enhance its worldwide fortunes -- said he was excited when ''The Lion King'' won best musical in 1998.</p>
        <p>''We were thrilled,'' he said. ''It was an acknowledgment from our peers that the show was good.''</p>
