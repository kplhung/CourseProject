        <p>You've got to believe that the old man, wherever he is now, enjoyed his own funeral Mass. The climax was Cardinal Bernard Law's eulogy to the career and mission of Cardinal John O'Connor. ''What a great legacy he has left us in his constant reminder that the church must always be unambiguously pro-life,'' Law said, his strong Brahmin voice resonating throughout the nave. And then, after a stunned pause, the applause grew, first from the back of the cathedral, then spreading to the front, as the assorted politicians found themselves rising uncomfortably to the occasion. I doubt if Cardinal O'Connor had ever made more people less comfortable in his lifetime. And it wasn't for lack of trying.</p>
        <p>What O'Connor meant by ''pro-life'' was all-encompassing. He was as opposed to abortion as he was to the death penalty, and after the late Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago, he was perhaps the most effective exponent of that position in recent memory. For O'Connor, as for the current pope, life is life is life. From conception to natural death, our first duty is to defend it. Where there's legitimate doubt about exactly what kind of life it is -- the life of an unborn child or a senile invalid or a convicted murderer -- we should always veer toward the side of clemency. To do otherwise is to play God, or to risk a subtle cheapening of human life that can in turn lead to a deeper disregard for it. Treat a fetus as disposable, and before too long the mentally handicapped or terminally ill will see their own right to life as negotiable as well.</p>

        <p>You've got to believe that the old man, wherever he is now, enjoyed his own funeral Mass. The climax was Cardinal Bernard Law's eulogy to the career and mission of Cardinal John O'Connor. ''What a great legacy he has left us in his constant reminder that the church must always be unambiguously pro-life,'' Law said, his strong Brahmin voice resonating throughout the nave. And then, after a stunned pause, the applause grew, first from the back of the cathedral, then spreading to the front, as the assorted politicians found themselves rising uncomfortably to the occasion. I doubt if Cardinal O'Connor had ever made more people less comfortable in his lifetime. And it wasn't for lack of trying.</p>
        <p>What O'Connor meant by ''pro-life'' was all-encompassing. He was as opposed to abortion as he was to the death penalty, and after the late Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago, he was perhaps the most effective exponent of that position in recent memory. For O'Connor, as for the current pope, life is life is life. From conception to natural death, our first duty is to defend it. Where there's legitimate doubt about exactly what kind of life it is -- the life of an unborn child or a senile invalid or a convicted murderer -- we should always veer toward the side of clemency. To do otherwise is to play God, or to risk a subtle cheapening of human life that can in turn lead to a deeper disregard for it. Treat a fetus as disposable, and before too long the mentally handicapped or terminally ill will see their own right to life as negotiable as well.</p>
        <p>Advocates of this ''seamless garment of life'' argument (the phrase was Bernardin's) can point to public opinion polls to show how the issues of abortion and the death penalty are related. Since the 1960's, support for legal abortion and the death penalty have tracked each other closely. Between 1972 and 1974, for example, the moment Roe v. Wade initiated the era of mass abortion in America, support for the death penalty also rose by 10 percent. Pure coincidence? According to the General Social Survey of the University of Michigan, Americans who opposed all legal abortion in recent years were twice as likely as other Americans to oppose the death penalty. On the other hand, those supporting legal abortion in every circumstance -- the abortion-rights absolutists -- were the group least likely to oppose capital punishment. It's just another area of life where the old right-left paradigm doesn't quite work anymore.</p>
        <p>At least in theory. In practice, politicians holding the consistent life-life position are as rare as they are gutsy. In the House of Representatives, I have been able to find only one man -- Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey -- who publicly opposes both abortion and the death penalty in principle and has a voting record to prove it. Among the other 30 to 40 anti-abortion Democrats, I couldn't find any with an unequivocal record against capital punishment. In the punditariat, I know of only two major writers, Nat Hentoff and Christopher Hitchens, who have doggedly resisted the pressure of their liberal allies and stuck to their life-life convictions. In the broader political arena, Pat Robertson, to his credit, has recently succumbed to doubts about the death penalty and called for a moratorium. But Robertson, like Illinois's governor, George Ryan, wants a moratorium only because he is concerned that some innocent people are being executed, not because he thinks it is wrong to kill under any circumstance.</p>
        <p>Others on the right hold more confused views. George W. Bush supports a constitutional amendment to ban abortion in most cases, and yet as governor of Texas he has personally signed the death warrants of more than 120 people -- about a sixth of all the condemned prisoners executed since capital punishment was revived in the 1970's. In an interview with Talk magazine last year, he even made fun of one of the victims of Texas' death row, Karla Fay Tucker, mocking her pleas for mercy. And despite growing DNA evidence of the innocence of many death-row convicts across the country, Bush has shown not even a glimmer of concern that the Texas judicial system might be flawed. Or take the vociferously anti-abortion representative Henry Hyde. Two years ago, Hyde said: ''I look for the common thread in slavery, the Holocaust and abortion. To me, the common thread is dehumanizing people.'' And yet Hyde has personally championed legislation that significantly curtails the judicial review of death-row appeals. Even Alan Keyes, that peerless defender of unborn life, turns out to be a supporter of criminals' deaths. He said earlier this year, ''I think that there are circumstances under which it is essential . . . that we have and apply the death penalty in order to send a clear moral message to people throughout our society that we will not tolerate that kind of disrespect for life.'' In other words, if you want to support life, enforce death.</p>
        <p>Liberals have honed a different compromise. The American Civil Liberties Union passionately supports the right of women to abort their potential children and vehemently opposes the right of government to execute proved murderers. That's also the position of the National Organization for Women, The New Republic and the New York Times editorial page. Liberals, of course, insist that they are not inconsistent, because they believe a fetus is not a person, while a criminal clearly is. But even if a fetus is not a person, is it not in some sense alive? And shouldn't any form of human life be worthy of at least some moral weight in a decision about its own life or death? It's also true that in a just conviction a criminal is guilty of murder, while a fetus in a legal abortion is guilty of nothing. Should culpability play no role in the question of who gets to die -- or are only the criminals worthy of empathy? And if part of the opposition to the death penalty springs from its physical cruelty, as it surely should, then how exactly can many death-penalty opponents support what some activists have called ''partial-birth abortion,'' a procedure that makes the electric chair seem positively comfy? Yet several Catholic senators are uncomfortable with giving a lethal injection to a criminal but defend crushing the skull of a viable partly born fetus. Go figure.</p>
        <p>Bill Clinton's signal contribution to this debate was to construct a new and powerful centrist position. Call it ''double death.'' Double-deathers consistently back the right to abort and the right to execute. Clinton twice vetoed legislation that would have banned late-term abortion, and famously interrupted his election campaign in 1992 to approve the execution of a mentally incapacitated prisoner in Arkansas. For Clinton, and other double-deathers, this combo has a powerful political rationale. The formula signals to the feminist left that Clinton is one of them (can I have your check now, please?), and it signals to the centrist right that he's not Michael Dukakis (can I have your vote now, please?). Under Clinton, execution rates have duly soared, the federal death penalty has been extended to a broadening array of crimes and the legal right to abort a fetus has become Democratic Party gospel. Clinton's heir, Al Gore, once had moral qualms about abortion. But he's a quick study and is now an absolutist defender of abortion rights and a fervent supporter of capital punishment. The same goes for Rudy Giuliani, whose commitment to the legality of certain kinds of killing has made him as tenacious a double-deather as Hillary Clinton.</p>
        <p>No wonder they squirmed in their pews. Life, after all, is a precious and precarious thing. But nothing as precarious as a politician's consistency.</p>
