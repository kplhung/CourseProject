        <p>When dawn broke, Jack Morrison was already five hours into his workday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morrison, the owner of the Nassau Street Seafood and Blue Point Grill here, was weaving amid crates of cooled sea bass and tightly packed soft-shell crabs at the Fulton Street Fish Market in lower Manhattan. With a checklist in one hand, his other hand reaching and roaming, scooping up a red snapper, pressing the body of a gray sole, swiping the side of a flounder (slime is good) looking for the perfect buy.</p>
        <p>Thousands of pounds of fish later -- enough to supply 90 percent of the seafood restaurants in this town -- Mr. Morrison returns home, listening to early-morning radio and melting into the flow of the first hints of traffic.</p>
        <p>For the past 18 years, the 48-year-old Mr. Morrison, a one-time math major at North Carolina Wesleyan University in Rocky Mount, has made buying fish his business. And with an expanding catering business and a year-old restaurant poised to open seven days a week, he has increasingly made cooking it his business as well.</p>
        <p>''We try to avoid fusion-confusion,'' said Mr. Morrison of the Blue Point Grill fare. ''We took about a year to research what worked and the more we looked the simpler the plate became.''</p>
        <p>Between predawn trips to the Fulton Fish Market two or three days a week and jaunts to a produce and seafood market in Philadelphia, Mr. Morrison's business processes more than 15,000 pounds of fish a week, a breakdown that includes 6,000 clams and 4,000 oysters and 1,000 pounds of squid alone.</p>
        <p>At some point he says he wants to get a master's degree in business from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. For now, he is spending much of his time preparing for the busiest time of year.</p>
        <p>Between Memorial Day weekend and June 6, Mr. Morrison said his catering business would prepare close to 11,000 meals. Since 1990, Nassau Street Seafood catered Princeton University's 25th and 40th class reunions at the end of May as well as the university's annual staff day in early June.</p>
        <p>''Jack was very committed to doing something very special for the reunion and the class and for me, said Kinsley Morse of the Class of '74, who planned the menus for her 25th reunion last year. ''He really cared. The results were wonderful.''</p>
        <p>The catering service has also had its brush with celebrity, managing a 500-person birthday beach party for Governor Whitman, a seafood fete for Representative Jim Saxon and a swordfish dinner for President Clinton.</p>
        <p>But celebrity customers and exotic cuisine aside, Mr. Morrison and his ''if-we're-here-then-it's-open'' policy work to give the restaurant and the adjacent store a homey feel. ''We wanted a place that you could walk in and feel like it has been here forever,'' said Mr. Morrison. ''We wanted a neighborhood joint.''</p>
        <p>In a neighborhood that has ''boutiqued over the years,'' as the author John McPhee puts it, Blue Point Grill is a welcome exception to a rule of receding mom-and-pops and ever-arriving national chains.</p>
        <p>''I really got into the business because I enjoy food,'' said Mr. Morrison, who started work at the store of a friend's father in Philadelphia before moving here to start his own. ''I worked for free during a holiday because I liked it. He looked at me like I was crazy.''</p>
        <p>Likewise, Nassau Street Seafood began as a small market endeavor, with a strategy to stay in one spot and add on gradually.</p>
        <p>''We made $112 the first day, and my mother bought $108 of it,'' Mr. Morrison said. Now he ships his mother her seafood and she doesn't send a check.</p>
        <p>With no competition from area fish markets, Mr. Morrison supplies about 40 Princeton restaurants with the fresh fish they need, taking their orders into New York City  and returning with them filled, plus anything else looking good that day.</p>
        <p>''He'll get you whatever you need,'' said Scott Anderson, who orders $5,000 of fish a week for his kitchen at Mediterra, a Greek restaurant here. ''He's very customer-oriented.''</p>
        <p>Brian Dougherty, the director of purchasing at Princeton's Nassau Inn, put it this way: ''The best part about working with Jack is he's always there. He has an extensive knowledge of fish and he knows where to get things on short notice. If you visit the store, as soon as you see that stuff in the cases you're just going to want to use that guy. The product speaks for itself.''</p>
        <p>As for himself, Mr. Dougherty said that each week he bought $2,500 of fish from Nassau Street Seafood, requesting extra-heavy salmon, 10-per-pound scallops and even fresh anchovies for a chef who ''loves to do special dishes.''</p>
        <p>Bringing the coast to central Jersey, Mr. Morrison increasingly relies on direct relationships with the seafood shippers, circumventing the fluctuations of the daily market, where prices can jump 400 percent from one day to the next.</p>
        <p>''By working the phones you're not running around the market going crazy,'' Mr. Morrison said. ''With sources you can avoid the spot market, where white-tablecloth restaurants of upscale Manhattan command prices.''</p>
        <p>Currently, Mr. Morrison gets 75 percent of his fish directly from the shippers, haggling only over the remaining 25 percent.</p>
        <p>When he arrives at the Fulton Fish Market, he parks his truck alongside tractor-trailers that he says sometimes back up a quarter-mile. The shippers deliver their orders straight to him in cardboard boxes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morrison's clipboard will carry such requests from local chefs as squid or fresh anchovies. So he will enter the nation's largest domestic seafood market to feel out fish and figure prices.</p>
        <p>When he returns from the market he sends out faxes of what fish he got and what prices he is charging. Some restaurants preorder very specific requests, while others give him a general idea and let him use his judgment. Later, he delivers the fish to the various restaurants here.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1931, the Fulton Fish Market is a world of frayed flannels, muddied boots and Marlboro reds, where ''hi-lows'' zip around the aisles and alleyways and merchants wield metal hooks that maneuver boxes and fish alike.</p>
        <p>''You don't want to buy everything from the source,'' Mr. Morrison said. ''Some stuff you just want to look at.''</p>
