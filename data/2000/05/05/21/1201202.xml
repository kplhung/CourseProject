        <p>MORE hosts and hostesses are savoring summer by hiring others, ''reinforcements,'' as one hostess euphemistically called her caterer, to handle their outings and entertaining.</p>
        <p>If you arrive early for a South Shore Music concert at the Saugatuck Congregational Church in Westport, as I did recently, you will find people sitting in the church garden eating picnics supplied by Garelick &amp; Herbs. A $16 picnic will contain a choice of garlic-herb marinated chicken breast, poached salmon or portobello mushroom with spinach and feta cheese. The accompaniments, all in separate containers, are a mixed baby green salad with balsamic dressing on the side, wild rice with cranberries, an asparagus medley, a Kaiser roll, a lemon bar, a small bottle of water, plastic utensils and large paper napkin.</p>

        <p>MORE hosts and hostesses are savoring summer by hiring others, ''reinforcements,'' as one hostess euphemistically called her caterer, to handle their outings and entertaining.</p>
        <p>If you arrive early for a South Shore Music concert at the Saugatuck Congregational Church in Westport, as I did recently, you will find people sitting in the church garden eating picnics supplied by Garelick &amp; Herbs. A $16 picnic will contain a choice of garlic-herb marinated chicken breast, poached salmon or portobello mushroom with spinach and feta cheese. The accompaniments, all in separate containers, are a mixed baby green salad with balsamic dressing on the side, wild rice with cranberries, an asparagus medley, a Kaiser roll, a lemon bar, a small bottle of water, plastic utensils and large paper napkin.</p>
        <p>A sharp-eyed attendee of many summer events will observe picnic suppers opened from a variety of snappy caterers' boxes, whether it be the Fourth of July fireworks display at Waveny Park or outdoor concerts in the St. Mark's Episcopal Church courtyard in New Canaan, Shakespeare on the Sound, a Bay Queen cruise around the lighthouse in Norwalk Harbor or at the Cabaret Theater in Bridgeport. Russell's Creative Global Cuisine in West Hartford has done boxed dinners for a bus excursion to Foxwoods Casino for the Lincoln Financial Group of Hartford.</p>
        <p>''We got boxes with sturdy cut-plastic domed covers that could be inverted and used as plates,'' said Russell Pryzbek, who owns the business. ''The menu for 22 people included chicken Napoleon, layered with grilled eggplant, served on red lentils and Israeli couscous; sesame green beans with honey noodles; cashews with julienne snow peas; and sky-high scallion biscuits. Dessert was boxed separately: white chocolate pear truffles, pecan diamonds, biscotti, and chocolate-dipped strawberries.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pryzbek, who has been a caterer for 20 years, has observed how tastes have changed, much to his delight. ''It used to be like trying to move a large ship with a tugboat,'' he said. ''Nowadays, clients are much more willing to try new things, presentation is more important, and there are so many more interesting foods to choose from.''</p>
        <p>Caterers' lists now resemble long menus in creative, stylish restaurants. The options are staggering, with the potential for turning an ordinary lawn party into a Julia Child-type gala celebration.</p>
        <p>Butternut strudel, ancho-crusted tenderloin, caper-crusted monkfish fillet, tamarind-glazed quail on a bed of Asian greens, coconut mahi-mahi with passion fruit sauce, skewered pork with cashew sate, grilled swordfish with papaya basil salsa, yucca fritters, artichoke gratin, corn-serrano chili muffins, baked bananas and macadamia nuts in phyllo pastry are just a few of the choices available from some of Connecticut's master caterers.</p>
        <p>Prices are pegged to the complexity of the menu, number of guests and level of service. A buffet dinner for 50 people might cost $20 to $75 (or up) a person. There may be extra charges for workers and beverages, and for rentals like chairs, tables, china, silver and centerpieces.</p>
        <p>What's in it for the client? A caterer allows the host to join the party. Jens Risom of New Canaan said, ''Unless you use a caterer, and in our case it is usually Best Wurst, you don't have any time with your guests.'' His wife, Henrietta Risom, agreed. ''Almost everything you cook, except a stew, needs last-minute attention,'' she said. ''Because of all the last-minute details, having a caterer counts a lot with me. I get the pleasure of actually being able to talk with my guests.''</p>
        <p>Julie Holloway of Darien said: ''We use a caterer, the Good Food Store, when we have large dinner parties, school functions or benefits, because it makes entertaining groups of 50 or 60 so much easier. I even used Good Food when I gave a dinner party recently for friends going to live in London and we had just 20 guests.''</p>
        <p>Debra Ponzak, owner of Aux Delices in Riverside, said parties with a specific cuisine -- Mexican, Caribbean, Thai -- have become especially popular in summer. ''People like the idea of a fiesta,'' she said. ''We have Mexican serapes to hang for a Mexican theme, cushions to place around for a Moroccan party.'' Like many full-service caterers, Aux Delices can supply everything: food, workers, linens, decorations, even music.</p>
        <p>Incredible Edibles, a Stamford caterer, does Hawaiian luaus in summer, even decking its servers in appropriate costumes. ''We feature suckling pig,'' said the chef, Ann Rossi, ''though usually we do a chicken dish as well, for people who don't like the sight of the pig.''</p>
        <p>Like most caterers in Fairfield County, Ms. Rossi likes to do fanciful hors d'oeuvres. ''People want something they haven't seen at someone else's party. We've done Vietnamese-style shrimp on sugar cane with a red chili dipping sauce, jiggers of gazpacho served with demitasse spoons, green apple and smoked duck tart and little zucchini pancakes with creme fraiche. Sometimes we use little hibachis with sate skewers. When you think summer, you think fun.''</p>
        <p>To Susan Goodman of Susan Goodman Catering in New Canaan, hors d'oeuvres offer endless fun and variety. Her menu lists more than 50 choices, including a basket of seasonal garden crudites with dips; Jamaican beef patties; skewered tortellini with red pepper and pesto dip; Indian samosas with peach chutney; and salmon mousse on endive spears.</p>
        <p>Chris Bracken, owner of Culinary Concerts in Madison, likes to make  an elaborate shellfish bar, raw and cooked, for a summer party. ''I use nets, old granite pails, lobster traps and old bricks, sometimes even arrange a 12-inch white trellis in a pot of geraniums, to create a rustic, homespun backdrop,'' he said. He then cooks one or two types of clams, citrus-grilled shrimp and crab cakes in an old iron skillet, and also serves raw shucked oysters and clams.</p>
        <p>Texas-style barbecues as well as clam and lobster bakes are also summer favorites. ''Usually people want parties like these for a sizable crowd,'' said Catherine Stebinger, owner of the Good Food Store in Darien. ''For a clam or lobster bake, we dig a pit, with seaweed and stones, and for a barbecue we rent a six-foot-long barbecue with a rotisserie spit on it for the suckling pig.''</p>
        <p>Culinary Concerts of Madison has been catering the Connecticut Arts Gala in the parking lot of the Bushnell in Hartford for six years, with sit-down dinners for 450 or so guests, but Mr. Bracken said he enjoyed small events, too.</p>
        <p>Susan Raible, events coordinator for Culinary Concerts, said that in summer, ''We use more citrus marinades, and focus on color and textures on platters to be visually inviting.'' On Culinary Concerts' agenda for July is a three-day family reunion at the shore, with 80 adults and 30 children.</p>
        <p>''There will be a series of lunches and a big Stars and Stripes barbecue,'' Ms. Raible said, ''and we'll do watermelon margaritas and a lot of homemade nonalcoholic drinks for the kids.''</p>
        <p>Weddings are the biggest catered events during summer, but birthdays, anniversaries, bar mitzvahs and children's parties are also popular. ''Kids' parties can be difficult,'' said Deborah Fisher, owner of Best Wurst in New Canaan, ''because of all the animals around. Ponies are O.K., but it isn't so easy working around live snakes and iguanas, which we have done.''</p>
        <p>Boat picnics have become highly popular. ''People going out on their boats love to take along pre-fixed items,'' said Ms. Ponzak of Aux Delices, ''but, unlike lawn parties, they want the food to be easy, nothing with stuff on top that's hard to eat.</p>
        <p>''The basic rule for portable food seems to be to avoid fussy things. Select easy-to-eat finger or fork foods that won't spill or make a mess. Soft-shell crabs, pre-fixed meats, poached fish, anything that can be served at room temperature.''</p>
        <p>Corporations are involved, too. Best Wurst provides food and staff for many company outings, such as one for Muehlstein International in which the employees played softball on the baseball diamond at Calf Pasture Beach in East Norwalk. ''Then we gave the executives chef's hats,'' Ms. Fisher said, ''and they loved grilling the bratwurst, chicken breasts and vegetables themselves, while our staff prepared and served the rest of the meal.''</p>
        <p>''It may be surprising, considering the hot weather, but what people tend to want in summer is grilling,'' Ms. Goodman said. Last summer she catered a carnival for a direct marketing company, M.B.I., in its Norwalk parking lot. ''There were 1,500 people,'' she said, ''and we had circus performers, games, hot dog carts, and we grilled ribs and corn on seven grills. It was fabulous.'' Ms. Goodman prepares and cooks everything at the site. ''Of course it demands careful advance organizing, but it guarantees that everything is extremely fresh.''</p>
