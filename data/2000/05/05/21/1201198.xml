        <p>ALL art is potentially local. A treasure from some remote place on display at a nearby museum can become the property of anyone's heart. But there's an added fillip when works from around home are presented locally with an eclat that declares their importance.</p>
        <p>Connecticut's only national park, Weir Farm in Wilton, has local scale. It is the country cousin of a vest pocket park, an intimate urban oasis. If Weir Farm lacks the majesty of Yellowstone, its compactness allows visitors to immerse themselves in the world of J. Alden Weir, the Impressionist painter for whom it is named. Weir lived on the property from 1882 until his death in 1919, and many of his best-known paintings were done there.</p>

        <p>ALL art is potentially local. A treasure from some remote place on display at a nearby museum can become the property of anyone's heart. But there's an added fillip when works from around home are presented locally with an eclat that declares their importance.</p>
        <p>Connecticut's only national park, Weir Farm in Wilton, has local scale. It is the country cousin of a vest pocket park, an intimate urban oasis. If Weir Farm lacks the majesty of Yellowstone, its compactness allows visitors to immerse themselves in the world of J. Alden Weir, the Impressionist painter for whom it is named. Weir lived on the property from 1882 until his death in 1919, and many of his best-known paintings were done there.</p>
        <p>While Weir Farm and Weir's studio are accessible year round, some of their fruit are within even easier reach this summer. The Bruce Museum in Greenwich and the Stamford Art and Nature Center are presenting contrasting aspects of the farm as major exhibitions. The two shows offer a ''then and now'' experience.</p>
        <p>The Bruce's show will feature Weir himself in a show titled ''A Connecticut Place: Weir Farm, an American Painter's Rural Retreat.'' It will have 50 paintings done by Weir on his property or close by.</p>
        <p>Weir Farm still doubles as an artists' retreat. Artists compete to spend up to a year there, and they use the grounds as open-air studios.</p>
        <p>''Weir Farm Visiting Artists,'' at the Stamford Museum and Nature Center, presents the work of six artists in residence during 1998 and 1999. The six were asked to create  bodies of work that reflected either their personal experiences or the landscape at Weir Farm. Betty Tompkins made a mound of earth as a base for huge sculptures of deer; Bob Chaplin's jigsaw puzzle makes a picture of the grounds, and John Gruen, a photographer, took close-ups of flowers.</p>
        <p>Another artist who made his home in the state was Alexander Calder. In 1933, Calder, who was becoming the toast of New York and Paris, moved to Roxbury, where he lived and worked until his death in 1976. The Wadsworth Atheneum recalls those days in an exhibition titled ''Calder and Connecticut.'' Calder perfected the forms with which he is forever linked, the mobile and the stabile, at his Roxbury studio. Those works of his had their debut at the Atheneum in 1935.</p>
        <p>Calder might be best known for his delicately balanced mobiles, or for sculptures that can assume circus tent-size proportions, like the orange ''Stegosaurus,'' a permanent fixture outside the Atheneum's door. But he made innumerable small works, often quick magicianlike gestures. The exhibition includes his fanciful jewelry, as well as paintings, prints and drawings. Calder's graphic work is often slighted, but it consists of the same bright colors and basic shapes (with a twist) as his sculpture. One graphic work was a campaign poster for Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff.</p>
        <p>''Calder in Connecticut'' is a thoroughly contemporary exhibition, which means that it includes a wealth of supporting material. It has endearing photographs, film and correspondence from the larger-than-life artist's daily life in Roxbury.</p>
        <p>In a statewide survey of cultural landmarks, Calder and Weir Farm would be widely recognized. But Gothic revival might not be. The Yale Art Gallery has taken on the major task of reviving a revival: the flowering of art from 1830 to 1875 inspired by the Middle Ages and early Renaissance.</p>
        <p>The early part of the revival coincided with the Romantic movement, and Americans no doubt embraced the style largely for romantic reasons, which can include Anglophilia. A favorite author of the period, Sir Walter Scott, lived in a house built like a castle. Americans found that fascinating.</p>
        <p>But the curators have something local in mind.</p>
        <p>The exhibition and the accompanying catalog serve as a guide to Gothic Revival architecture in Connecticut, the rest of New England and the Northeast. The show's catalog lists numerous Gothic Revival monuments in New Haven, City Hall for one, and on the Yale campus, including the library and the former School of Fine Arts. Much of the fine arts  building is now part of the Yale Art Gallery.</p>
        <p>A main purpose of these tours is to encourage preservation. If a viewer doesn't feel like a physical visit, the exhibition makes an armchair trip possible by CD-ROM.</p>
        <p>While exalting local culture makes people feel proud and comfortable, sometimes a charge is wanted. There is fascination in seeing the familiar tweaked in an unexpected way.</p>
        <p>New London is experiencing a revival, as the refurbishing of its vacant downtown buildings shows. It is poised for Sculpture 2000, 21 works installed on the city's shoreline. Its organizers refer to the event as ''an international event with a grass-roots sensitivity.'' Schoolchildren helped install the pieces.</p>
        <p>The artists come from Connecticut and New York, but also from Morocco, Poland, Colombia, India, Israel and Brazil. New London was once a major port and trading center, so it is being true to its these roots with this exhibition, which is a cultural exchange.</p>
