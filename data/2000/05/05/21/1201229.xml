        <p>Susan Marie Kaider, a dog trainer in Manhattan, and Michael Joseph Nastasi, a dog portrait photographer and the owner of a Web site, CanisPhoto.com, were married yesterday next to the Bethesda Fountain in Central Park. The Rev. Michael Carter, a Unitarian minister, officiated.</p>
        <p>The bride calls her service Dogs-in-the-Hood Training, which helps pets learn, for example, that they must not lunge at pedestrians, chicken bones or other dogs on city sidewalks. She graduated from Manhattan College and is a daughter of Patricia and Timothy R. Kaider of Conneaut Lake, Pa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nastasi is also a program director at the New York City Department of Design and Construction. He received an undergraduate degree in engineering from Columbia University and is the son of Dorothy Spaulding of Boston and Joseph Nastasi of Woburn, Mass.</p>
        <p>The couple met in the fall of 1998, walking their dogs in Central Park. ''I was on the Great Lawn walking my boxer, Rugby, and my two little Chihuahua terriers, Minnie and Miss Ellie,'' Ms. Kaider, 31, said. ''Michael said he saw me and thought: 'Wow, this girl must not have a boyfriend. She's got three dogs -- she's a crazy dog lady.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nastasi was walking his Rhodesian ridgeback, Mika. He introduced himself to Ms. Kaider, thinking her brood would be fun to photograph. ''She looked very original, and so did her dogs,'' said Mr. Nastasi, 38. ''Two of them were very small, and one was very funny looking.''</p>
        <p>When she returned home, she looked at his Web site. ''I thought the pictures were just astounding, capturing the spirit of New York dogs,'' she said. ''They weren't what a friend calls 'puppies in a basket' pictures.'' A few days later, she sent an e-mail message to him to arrange a portrait session for her dogs. They met at Bethesda Fountain, and during the shoot, found that they were equally passionate about dogs. (Both carry dog treats in their pockets wherever they go, and are given to comical pet stories).</p>
        <p>''He understands the humor in dogs, and it's so hard to find someone like that,'' Ms. Kaider said.</p>
        <p>Two months after they met, she and her dogs moved into his apartment. ''The first night, my dogs just whined and barked, because it was a new place for them,'' she said. ''We both thought, 'Is this going to work or not?' '' Now, the couple provide homemade meals for their brood each night, then watch the dogs play together -- equally fascinated, it appears, by each small growl and change of expression. ''We love every noise they make,'' Mr. Nastasi said.</p>
        <p>All the dogs attended the wedding, and their guests' dogs were invited as well. The couple won't immediately leave on a honeymoon. First, the bride must contend with a dog emergency: a man in Battery Park City who just adopted a 10-week-old, out-of-control sheltie named Little Timmy. ''The owner doesn't know how to walk the dog,'' she said. ''He doesn't know anything. He gave me the option to cancel, but I said I'd be there.''</p>
