        <p>ALLAN HOUSTON appears to be one of nature's noblemen. He is the kind of guy who would never think of reaching across someone's plate and snaring a chicken leg on the dinner table.</p>
        <p>His gentle, even demeanor strikes you as someone you could tell your troubles to, like a shrink, or a barber. He is not about to interrupt you to make his point. Allan Houston raising his voice seems as implausible as hockey fans at Carnegie Hall.</p>
        <p>And his eyes -- his wide, brown, doe-like eyes -- are filled with compassion, understanding, serenity. So on those occasions when he mutates into a monster, it is bewildering, and, if you are a Knicks fan, wondrous.</p>
        <p>''At halftime,'' Chris Childs said -- referring to Friday night's game when the Knicks trailed the Heat in Game 6 at Madison Square Garden, and had been booed with a profound and insightful passion by their adoring fans -- ''Allan came into the locker room all emotional. He was just saying things. He was upset. And you could tell it in his eyes. His eyes were speaking loudly.''</p>
        <p>''At halftime,'' Houston said after the game, in which the Knicks mounted an astonishing comeback to win by 72-70, and send the series to Game 7 this afternoon in Miami, ''I felt that we had to stay together as a team. Just keep doing all the good, fundamental things we knew we could do. And I had to attack the basket more.''</p>
        <p>Attack he did. Not wild, like a wildebeest. More like Hannibal, coolly charting out the best positions for his elephants, and decisively heading tusks-first into the breach.</p>
        <p>It was truly a team effort, as they posit in the textbooks, but in this case, and in more and more cases over the past few years, Houston has assumed a leadership role, both on the court and in the locker room. In typical understated fashion, he seems to have emerged, like the top patriarch in the Eastern Orthodox Church, first among equals.</p>
        <p>And when Houston at times on the court becomes as passive as a rag doll, or, in another instance, hostage to a gooey defender like Dan Majerle, the team must hurdle that barrier, of a lost or nugatory leader. Not good.</p>
        <p>Such was the case in Game 5, when he attempted but two shots in the second half, as the team lost in the closing minute. Houston is the team's high scorer, at about 20 a game. He scored 12 in that game. In the first half of the game Friday, which the Knicks had to win to dodge elimination, he shot 3 for 9 -- hitting one 3-point shot -- and had taken no free throws. Not good.</p>
        <p>''I had heard all that stuff about how good Majerle was guarding me,'' Houston said, ''and I heard guys telling me, 'Majerle can't guard you.' I heard lots of things. But I knew I just couldn't keep settling for jump shots. I'm always better when I become more aggressive.''</p>
        <p>With just 46 seconds gone in the third quarter, Houston sank a 3-point shot. But he was looking to drive. Shortly after that 3-pointer, he swept to the hoop and hit a twisting layup through and over a host of arms. Within a half-minute, he drove again, but found Charlie Ward under the hoop with a dish that Emeril Lagasse would have loved. There was another assist by Houston.</p>
        <p>And after a timeout, it was Houston who went to each of the other players on the court and whispered a reminder of a play to come. The Knicks, with others like Latrell Sprewell, Larry Johnson, Patrick Ewing and Ward picking up the pace with shots, steals and rebounds, chopped the deficit, amazingly, to 4, back up to 7 on an Anthony Carter 3-pointer, but Houston had the last word in the period, hitting a spinning, fadeaway jump shot seconds before quarter's end.</p>
        <p>Knicks fans were on their feet. Their screams could be heard in Bergen County. Suddenly, no greater love had they.</p>
        <p>And, as history now records, the Knicks came back in the fourth quarter to tie the game at 70-70, and, with 17.6 seconds left, Houston, taking it upon himself to do something special, drove to the hoop again, was fouled, and, with that delicious combination of frost and fire -- ice cream and hot fudge -- Houston sank the 2 final points of the game, for a team-leading 21 points -- 5 for 6 from the field, including a pair of 3's and 3 free throws.</p>
        <p>Now the Knicks go back to Miami, a team that they view (and are viewed in return) with the ardor reserved for a neighbor who keeps running over your lawn with his truck. And has a dog that barks all night, to boot. But it was in the deciding game of last year's playoffs, which also went the full length, when Houston again emerged the hero with a last-second shot that bounced up and then in, a moment in Knick lore that ranks with Willis Reed's limp.</p>
        <p>Houston, in fact, twisted his ankle on a drive in the last half Friday. But you would not have known it by watching him.</p>
        <p>''It's still sore,'' he said after the game, ''but it'll be ready in Miami. And the team that can execute under pressure, that can make the big plays, the plays you dream about and pray about, that team will win.'' He said Friday night's game demonstrated how the Knicks stick together, do not get rattled, make the big plays under pressure.</p>
        <p>There is a saying in sports that you must let the game come to you. But not if you are the star. Not if you are the leader. You must take the game by the lapels, and demand satisfaction.</p>
        <p>Houston, who was a virtual bystander in Game 5, did what a star has to do in Game 6. He did what a leader has to do. That is, he did it.</p>
        <p>Game 7 awaits.</p>
