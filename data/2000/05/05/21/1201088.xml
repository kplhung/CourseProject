        <p>Wes Pedersen letter on Peter Marks' May 7 article on late-night talk-show hosts' comedic coverage of presidential candidates holds candidates, past and present, lack senses of humor2</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Abraham Lincoln, Adlai Stevenson, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole. What did each have that today's presidential candidates lack in such great abundance? A sense of humor, springing from the gut, not a 3-by-5-inch ghost-written card [''Fear and Joking on the Late-Night Campaign Trail'' by Peter Marks, May 7]. Neither Al Gore nor George W. Bush has the instincts it takes to go joke for joke with a killer comic. Indeed, it sometimes seems that both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have decided that maybe Calvin Coolidge had the right idea: ''I think the American public wants a solemn ass as a President. And I think I'll go along with them.'' Each would profit from the advice of Richard M. Nixon, who, of all people, said, ''The worst sin in politics is being boring.'' And, when elected, the winner should keep in mind this warning from Mr. Dole: ''What people often forget is that the last laugh doesn't belong to the victorious candidate -- it belongs to the late-night comics.''</p>
