        <p>Unusually wide range of US companies has banded together to lobby Congress in support of pending China trade bill; nearly a dozen US insurers and about 90 others from Japan, Europe and elsewhere have been wooing Chinese officials for several years; each year, China invites a few to apply for licenses, and some are approved after a couple years of red tape; passage of trade bill would mean any company could apply to do business in China, though US insurers do not expect China to suddenly issue licenses to everyone (M)</p>

        <p>For American insurance companies, China is a virtually untapped market. Most Chinese do not have coverage, and though they lack great wealth, they save a larger share of their earnings than Americans do.  American insurers hope to sell them life insurance with savings features, as well as health insurance and pension plans.</p>
        <p>For several years, nearly a dozen  insurers from the United States and about 90 others from Japan, Europe and elsewhere have been romancing the Chinese -- meeting with government officials and potential business partners, offering free classes in underwriting and making gifts to universities.</p>
        <p>Each year, a few insurers have been invited to apply for licenses. Then, after a couple of years of stepping through government hurdles, they have been allowed to open.</p>
        <p>Nine foreign insurers, mostly life insurers, now sell policies in China, including two from the United States -- the American International Group and Aetna. Passage of the trade bill would mean that any company could apply for a license. But American insurers do not expect China to suddenly issue licenses to everyone.</p>
        <p>''We're not going to wake up and all of a sudden find the flood gates open,'' one American executive said. ''They are very cautious.''</p>
        <p>Instead, he said, perhaps a half-dozen foreign insurers would be allowed in each year, and all would operate on a short tether.</p>
        <p>Now, with the exception of A.I.G. -- which was founded in Shanghai in 1919 and, in 1980, was the first American financial services company to open an office in modern China -- they are restricted to Shanghai. Under the pact, they would be allowed to expand gradually to other cities.</p>
        <p>American insurers say they would prefer fewer restrictions, but like other foreign businesses, they are overwhelmed by China's potential. ''Things don't have to be perfect,'' said Brad Smith of the American Council on Life Insurance. ''This is a good first step.''</p>
