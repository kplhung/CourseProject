        <p>I LIVE in a neighborhood built in friendlier times, before central air-conditioning and television rendered front porches obsolete. By local standards, my porch is barely adequate. It's not particularly gracious, it doesn't wrap around, it isn't screened and it's just big enough to support a couple of window boxes, a few chairs and a table. But that's enough, when the weather gets nice, to give me a purchase on the outside world at the same time I'm engaged in that despicable activity known as work.</p>
        <p>In the summer, I work on my porch almost every morning. As long as the wind isn't too strong, and none of my neighbors have just had their lawns sprayed, if the grass and tree guys are busy on other streets and the teenagers next door aren't washing their cars with the radio blaring, I can -- thanks to modern technology -- talk or type to my heart's content. I can work and yet be in touch the season.</p>

        <p>I LIVE in a neighborhood built in friendlier times, before central air-conditioning and television rendered front porches obsolete. By local standards, my porch is barely adequate. It's not particularly gracious, it doesn't wrap around, it isn't screened and it's just big enough to support a couple of window boxes, a few chairs and a table. But that's enough, when the weather gets nice, to give me a purchase on the outside world at the same time I'm engaged in that despicable activity known as work.</p>
        <p>In the summer, I work on my porch almost every morning. As long as the wind isn't too strong, and none of my neighbors have just had their lawns sprayed, if the grass and tree guys are busy on other streets and the teenagers next door aren't washing their cars with the radio blaring, I can -- thanks to modern technology -- talk or type to my heart's content. I can work and yet be in touch the season.</p>
        <p>Real grown-ups -- those titans of industry and politics who march into the city with their briefcases and organizers and who have trouble finding enough casual clothes to wear on Fridays -- might not understand. But some of us cannot labor contently under fluorescent lights, no matter how much money, power or Starbucks you offer us.</p>
        <p>Especially in summer.</p>
        <p>I was in high school the first time I worked inside during the summer. My boss was my dad, who owned a small publishing company, and I was frequently told how lucky I was to get the experience. But although I made a small fortune by teenage standards, and had already begun to build my resume, I might as well have been a princess trapped in a dungeon. The end of light and air in summer was, quite simply, the end of childhood.</p>
        <p>Fast forward a quarter of a century to life in the electronic cottage, the home-based information age economy predicted by Alvin Toffler. How Mr. Toffler figured this all out before the modem, the laptop and e-mail were invented, I'll never know. But I bet he worked it out all out on that forerunner of the laptop -- the portable typewriter -- sitting on his front porch, enjoying the breeze and feeling superior to all those drones still chained to offices.</p>
        <p>Well, the virtual office is here. And if you're still laboring under fluorescent lights when you could be outside, you deserve your pallid complexion. ''If necessary, put it in your schedule,'' said Carol Gerrish, a business-success coach in Monmouth Junction, N.J. ''Because it's too good to pass up.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Gerrish should know. It's her job to counsel those titans of industry on how to put more success, and balance, in their lives. Part of what she does is to remind them that the outdoors exists and that they are actually allowed to go there. Ms. Gerrish is an avid gardener. She spends as much time as possible outside once the temperature hits 60, reading productivity magazines at her backyard bistro table. ''Research and development,'' she said.</p>
        <p>David Alpern, a senior editor for Newsweek, often does interviews about the magazine's polls from his deck in Sag Harbor, on Long Island. ''It's clearly more fun to able to do it in the backyard with the sun and the trees and the moss and the hot tub gurgling on one side and the cat gurgling on the other,'' he said.</p>
        <p>You don't even have to have a yard. Or a laptop. Or a cordless. If your job involves thinking, all you really need to work outside in fair weather is your brain -- although pen and paper might come in handy. That's basically the only equipment used by Ira Gassman, who worked outdoors when he wrote the book and lyrics for the Broadway musical ''The Life.'' Mr. Gassman, who splits his time between Manhattan and Sag Harbor, has done all his writing for the past 20 years outside. When Mr. Gassman is in Sag Harbor, he starts his writing shift on the porch of the American Hotel. By 3 p.m., when he wraps up, he's worked at picnic tables, benches and beaches all over town, from Long Wharf to Marine Park.</p>
        <p>''I usually like to stay in the sun, so as the sun moves so do I,'' he said. He also likes the hubbub of human activity. ''I like people around me. It energizes me,'' he said. Mr. Gassman, however, is more energized by people on the whole than in the specific; he doesn't particularly want to be reached while he's in a creative mood. ''Phooey on phones,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Another soul who likes to write on the beach is Dan Rattiner, publisher of Dan's Papers, in Bridgehampton, also on Long Island. Mr. Rattiner has been writing on beaches for 15 years; he started going there to escape his children, who were always bursting into his home study. ''I get kind of into a dreamland state,'' he said. ''I can be irritable if I'm interrupted.'' Even in the dead of winter, Mr. Rattiner works at the beach -- inside his Lincoln Navigator.</p>
        <p>And if he happens to experience a small adventure while he's there, even better -- since the life of the South Fork of Long Island is, after all, his beat. He has witnessed fishermen show up late for feasts that the seagulls enjoyed just moments earlier, and once, having noticed some strange tropical birds on the beach, he just happened to run into East Hampton's town environmental officer, who was able to identify the species.</p>
        <p>I too have found working on my front porch providential. It's easy to strike up conversations with dog walkers, baby strollers and mail carriers who pass my way. Several years ago, one regular dog walker happened to mention that she was seeing an M.D., who was also an acupuncturist. I wound up writing a story about him, then seeing him for back pain and eventually he and I became friends. Last winter, I attended his wedding. None of this would have happened had I been holed up in my garret.</p>
        <p>Of course, the outside home office isn't always a Garden of Eden. As I write this -- outside on my porch, of course -- I'm discovering that it's about 10 degrees cooler than it looked when I decided I could work outside today. Barely had I opened my laptop when I found that neighbors two doors down were having two trees removed. Now they're feeding the limbs into a machine that turns them into sawdust, and which sounds like an electric pencil sharpener attached to Jimi Hendrix's amplifier.</p>
        <p>And as in the Garden of Eden, I sometime come across knowledge I'd just as soon not. That my mail carrier reads the postcards that inform us of our property taxes, for example. Or that certain neighbors back out of their driveways at frightening speeds.</p>
        <p>Luckily -- so far -- I haven't witnessed any squalid extramarital liaisons.</p>
        <p>The outdoor working life is not for everybody. Gil Gordon, a telecommuting consultant in Monmouth Junction, has worked at home for 18 years, but rarely takes his job outside. ''I want to preserve the feeling of separation and relaxation I get when I'm in the backyard or by the pool or by the lake,'' he said. ''I don't want to soil it with work.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gordon is working on a book due out next spring from Random House, ''Turn it Off: Controlling the Anytime-Anywhere Office.'' Mr. Gordon also points out that there are certain tangible physical hazards from setting up office outside, like having your children trip over the extension cord plugged into your computer. Actually, that happened to me just the other day, and I barely caught my laptop before it hit the deck. Had it crashed, though, I probably would have just bought a new and better one -- one with a working battery, so I wouldn't need that extension cord in the first place. Then I could take it to the pool.</p>
