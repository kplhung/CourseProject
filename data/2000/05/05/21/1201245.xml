        <p>THE e-mail message that popped into Stuart A. Hathaway's in-box on April 26 was most unusual. It was from a mutual fund company with which he had invested. Because of developments in the antitrust case against Microsoft and slowing sales of desktop computers to corporations, the message said, the manager had dumped all its Microsoft shares.</p>
        <p>Who gets a heads-up from his or her mutual fund company about its portfolio moves? Until recently, nobody. But in the last year or two, such detailed disclosure has become a trend, if not yet the norm, in the fund industry as it adapts to the Internet age. The Montgomery U.S. Select 20 fund, the one in which Mr. Hathaway invests, is the first offering in a series of new high-disclosure funds called Stock Solutions, introduced last month by Montgomery Asset Management, a company in San Francisco that manages $12 billion in 20 mutual funds.</p>
        <p>The message pleased Mr. Hathaway, 42, an engineer at the Bechtel Corporation in the Washington area who had his own concerns about Microsoft's future. ''I was thinking they would'' sell, he said.</p>
        <p>The Stock Solutions approach is far from the average arms-length mutual fund experience. Investors like Mr. Hathaway are given access to a Web site where they can monitor the fund's entire portfolio, updated weekly with a two-week lag time to give the managers time to complete transactions before going public. Each stock in the portfolio can be tracked all day, and investors can find detailed financial profiles of each holding and the fund manager's reasons for each purchase and sale. (Why did Andrew G. Pratt, the manager of the U.S. Select 20 fund, add Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical giant, in April? Because of its ''superior pipeline of new drugs including several potentially blockbuster drugs for the treatment of cancer and depression,'' investors are told.)</p>
        <p>That is much more than what an ordinary investor can learn about nearly any other fund. Peter Lynch, the Fidelity Investments oracle, likes to say, ''Know what you own, and why you own it.'' But given the standard practices of Fidelity, the Vanguard Group, the Janus Capital Corporation and most of the rest of the fund industry, trying to follow his advice can be a mystery worthy of a Sherlock Holmes, or at least someone adept  at trawling regulatory filings.</p>
        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission requires that funds disclose their full portfolios twice a year. Most do just that and no more, though some issue lists of top holdings and sector weightings a bit more often. So much can change over the course of six months that such disclosures give investors only a rough estimate of a manager's approach, not a clear fix on its position.</p>
        <p>The big fund companies like it that way. ''Our disclosure policy is meant to protect our proprietary research,'' said Jessica J. Catino, a Fidelity spokeswoman. ''In order to secure the best possible prices, our managers make purchases over weeks and months,'' Ms. Catino added, a practice that frequent disclosure would imperil.</p>
        <p>At the other end of the spectrum are two new companies that are pushing conventional boundaries. StockJungle.com of Los Angeles offers daily portfolio updates and even  takes suggestions from Web surfers for its Community Intelligence fund. (Maybe it's a balm for bear markets. This year, the broadly allocated fund is up 24.1 percent.)</p>
        <p>And nothing is left to the imagination at the $32.6 million OpenFund from MetaMarkets.com of San Francisco, which offers real-time portfolio updates and a history of all its trades on its Web site. You want disclosure? OpenFund even has a network of Web cameras on its trading floor.</p>
        <p>''It's so arrogant to think that I should be unaccountable, and every six months I'll just give people a peek,'' said Donald L. Luskin, chief executive of MetaMarkets and manager of OpenFund.</p>
        <p>OTHER funds have been experimenting for some time with more frequent disclosure. Munder NetNet, the pioneering Internet-focused fund with $8 billion in assets, reveals all its holdings monthly with a two-week lag; it also details purchases and sales on its Web site, www.mundernetnet.com.</p>
        <p>Robert A. Loest, who manages the $430 million IPS Millennium fund, posts a diary of his trades and rationale on his fund's site, www.ipsmillennium.com, as well as monthly portfolio updates with a few days of lag time. Investec Guinness Flight Global Asset Management, which runs $460 million in seven domestic funds, offers monthly portfolio updates at www.gffunds.com, with a two-week lag; it plans real-time disclosure.</p>
        <p>Executives at many of these companies said rapid disclosure did not crimp their investing styles the way it might for a giant like Fidelity or Janus. ''I don't think we're going to move markets,'' said James J. Atkinson Jr., head of United States mutual fund operations for Investec Guinness Flight. Market reaction is an issue ''that doesn't face us, but does face some of our competitors,'' he said. ''We will monitor it carefully,'' he added. ''If we feel that front-running is more than a theoretical risk, we might put a lag time back in.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Luskin of OpenFund said greater disclosure would have drawbacks for widely watched managers, for managers who make a small number of big bets, and for managers of large, potentially market-moving funds like Fidelity Magellan, with $104.6 billion in assets.</p>
        <p>''Suppose the market comes to believe some portfolio manager is an absolute genius,'' Mr. Luskin said. The manager's every move, he added, would soon ''attract free riders.'' He added that his own active trading throughout the day is hard to mimic, but that cherry-picking investors try anyway -- and even discuss their parallel moves on the message boards of the fund's Web site.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't matter to me,'' he said. ''We've already done our trades by the time they see it.''</p>
        <p>Still, why do the firms risk tipping their hands to competitors? Because customers want the information. When Montgomery asked 2,000 online mutual fund investors if they would be interested in a Stock Solutions-style offering, 97 percent said yes. For now, Montgomery is limiting its high-disclosure policy to focused funds with small portfolios; four more are in development.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Hathaway, he has no plans to poach ideas from his manager. He just likes knowing what he owns and why he owns it. ''It's close to having a portfolio of stocks,'' he said, ''but without having to do the manipulations on your own, which I don't have the knowledge to do.''</p>
