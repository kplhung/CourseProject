        <p>NEIL DRYSDALE did not indulge himself in a premonition of terror when the day stayed sodden and the dampness lingered in a surface that would be officially labeled as good.</p>
        <p>''I go race to race,'' said the taciturn Englishman. ''Otherwise, you'd go bonkers.''</p>
        <p>This was, of course, not just any race. This was the Preakness, where Triple Crown dreams often come to die. It happened yesterday as Fusaichi Pegasus could not match Red Bullet in heavy going down the stretch.</p>
        <p>Red Bullet's triumph was not a happy sign for the racing marketers, who desperately need a superhorse to boost their sagging business.</p>
        <p>''We've seen them come out of the Derby and think they're invincible,'' said Jerry Bailey, the winning jockey, ''and two weeks later at 5:45 we find out they're not invincible.''</p>
        <p>All 40,000 seats have been sold for the Belmont in three weeks, but now there is no allure of a Triple Crown, and little likelihood of another 40,000 standees swarming onto the grounds.</p>
        <p>For the last three years, the Triple Crown hopes stayed alive going into the Belmont. Yesterday it happened coming out of the far turn, when Red Bullet could maneuver on the muck, and Fusaichi Pegasus was merely ''slipping and sliding,'' as Drysdale put it.</p>
        <p>''He had never been on this surface, so you didn't know how he'd handle it,'' the trainer added.</p>
        <p>The Preakness had done its deed. This was the 125th running of the Preakness, and only 28 horses have won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, with 26 going on to try the Belmont, and 11 of them succeeding, but none since Affirmed in 1978.</p>
        <p>''I'm surprised there have been as many Derby-Preakness winners,'' said Joe Orseno, the trainer of Red Bullet, who kept his horse out of the Derby because he did not think he was ready, a novel concept.</p>
        <p>Compared to the international glamour of the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness comes off as a family reunion. For all its quaintness, the Preakness usually has one thing the Kentucky Derby never will have, by definition:</p>
        <p>''The Derby doesn't have a Derby winner,'' Orseno had said during the week, adding, ''You have to win a second one to win a third one.''</p>
        <p>This year there is no double winner to excite the general population going into June. But racing people know the calendar for 3-year-olds did not begin in Kentucky on May 6. The eight horses in the Preakness had survived a winter and spring demolition derby of flying hooves and looming bodies, complicated by their own tiny and fragile bones.</p>
        <p>''You're always concerned about bringing a horse back in two weeks,'' Drysdale had said during the week.</p>
        <p>D. Wayne Lukas, who has tried it every which way, said, ''It's always been my theory that the Preakness is so tough because it's the third tough race in a row, not two.''</p>
        <p>Fusaichi Pegasus lost his first race, then had won five straight, including the Wood Memorial in New York on April 15. He won the Derby at a mile and a quarter and then came to the Preakness, with its eccentric distance of a mile and three-sixteenths -- with slightly less room to erase mistakes, to allow true ability to assert itself.</p>
        <p>Distance was not the problem yesterday. Footing and balance and poise made the difference. Fusaichi Pegasus, carrying 126 pounds and the weight of his sport's expectations, seemed to be in good position heading toward the homestretch, where he had fired so impressively in the Derby. Instead, Red Bullet made his move.</p>
        <p>Asked when he realized Fusaichi Pegasus was in trouble, Drysdale said, ''When the horse accelerated, and he didn't come up.''</p>
        <p>The cold and the damp had hindered Fusaichi Pegasus, and maybe that was only fair. All week long, Drysdale, from Surrey, England, had tossed a bit of figurative cold water on the party by choosing to conduct business in seclusion.</p>
        <p>While the seven other Preakness horses were in Barn 40, a few steps from the endless supply of coffee and doughnuts at the hospitality tent, Drysdale opted for the drab security of a grassless cement compound at Barn 7, behind metal gates.</p>
        <p>Blandly, Drysdale insisted he knew nothing of the security measures that had guards locking the gates early and often.</p>
        <p>Being so close to the nation's capital, the home office of duplicity, the mystery of the extra security could easily be labeled Gategate.</p>
        <p>Aside from the odd raised eyebrow -- hard to document on the printed page -- there was little criticism of Drysdale's antisocial tactics.</p>
        <p>''Neil is doing what the horse needs,'' Orseno had said. ''My horse doesn't mind it.''</p>
        <p>Orseno knew his horse enough to skip the Derby after a fruitless chase of Fusaichi Pegasus in the Wood.</p>
        <p>''It's a lot to ask of the horse,'' Orseno had said. ''We had a terrible ride in the Wood, which was why I held him out of the Derby. I gave him a full week off, and he needed that week. We'd like to have him for the rest of the year. I would have loved to win the Derby -- but not at the horse's expense.''</p>
        <p>Drysdale and his Japanese ownership did nothing wrong by going from the Derby to the Preakness. Nor did they create the longing for a Triple Crown horse.</p>
        <p>They could control the workouts, and they could control the site of the barn, but they could not control the surface at the Preakness, where Derby winners are often taken down a peg, and this year where dreams of a super horse are scattered like torn-up mutuel tickets.</p>
