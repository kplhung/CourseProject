        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Are you aware of the trick truckers use to get through the E-ZPass toll booth and get their charges billed to the innocent automobile driver in  front of them? Perhaps not, since it wasn't mentioned in your May 7 article (''Road Rage, a New Jersey State of Mind''). The trucker tailgates the car in front and slides through the E-ZPath booth on the car's green light. The charging mechanism apparently calculates the truck's charge ($10.80 when it happened to me, in four separate incidents) and charges it to the  auto's account. When I contested the charges, the E-ZPass spokesman said they were aware of the problem.  But I don't know that any attempt has been made to inform the public.</p>

        <p>Auto drivers need to be vigilant about the vehicle behind when going  through an E-ZPass booth. Stop for a moment in the booth, or immediately beyond the green light, so the truck behind you can't sweep through and on your account.</p>
