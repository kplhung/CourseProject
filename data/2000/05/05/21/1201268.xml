        <p>IT may be the quintessential company in transition.</p>
        <p>Over the last few years, Eastman Kodak has jettisoned the legacies of failed diversification efforts, cut $1.2 billion in overhead and embarked on a series of digital photography initiatives intended to catapult the company into the new economy.</p>
        <p>Most analysts laud Kodak's efforts to reshape itself. The company, they say, has little choice but to wean itself off its reliance on the silver halide print photography business, with its high margins but flat long-term growth prospects, and embrace the less profitable, though potentially larger, digital-imaging market.</p>
        <p>But given the lackluster results shareholders have endured, many wonder if Kodak is really on the verge of such a transformation. ''They're doing a lot of things right,'' said B. Alex Henderson, an analyst with Prudential Securities. ''But the company's digital growth prospects are hardly spectacular, relative to other companies'' engaged in other areas of the digital universe.</p>
        <p>Granted, Kodak will not resemble a highflying dot-com anytime soon. At $57.0625 a share, the stock trades at around 10 times the $5.64 a share that analysts expect Kodak to earn this year. By contrast, the multiple for the Internet hardware maker Cisco Systems is about 100.</p>
        <p>The modest valuation suggests that investors still associate Kodak stock with old-economy torpor. Indeed, the shares are about where they were in December 1997, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index has climbed nearly 50 percent since then.</p>
        <p>Still, some tepid bulls say Kodak deserves some credit for the substantial progress it has made. ''Kodak's problem has not been execution,'' said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. The company, he said, has met or exceeded Wall Street's earnings expectations for the last five quarters. He expects the shares to reach $87.50 over the next year.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Rosenzweig said, ''the domestic film business won't deteriorate as fast as most expect,'' and demand in emerging markets, which accounts for about 25 percent of the company's film sales, is expanding. Still, he acknowledged, ''Long term, the overall film business looks flat.''</p>
        <p>That leaves Kodak's digital businesses to drive top-line growth, analysts say.</p>
        <p>Jack L. Kelly of Goldman, Sachs, thinks that the company's investment is about to pay off. Though Kodak has not yet earned a nickel on the $2.8 billion digital portfolio, which accounts for about 20 percent of its $14.1 billion in 1999 revenue, digital losses shrank to 24 cents a share in 1999, from 53 cents a year earlier, and the business should turn a modest profit this year, Mr. Kelly said. His 12-month price target is $80-plus.</p>
        <p>STILL, most analysts say Kodak must move beyond low-margin, nonproprietary offerings like digital cameras and digitization services to earn real money in this arena.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henderson of Prudential thinks the company's commercial ventures -- particularly its online repository of scenes used as backdrops for films and videos -- are promising. ''Kodak is uniquely qualified to provide this kind of database engineering,'' he said. Despite his bearish long-term outlook, he rates the stock ''accumulate.''</p>
        <p>Analysts also liked Kodak's recently announced plans to purge $1 billion from its $6 billion procurement budget by 2002, in part by eliminating vendors who cannot achieve double-digit productivity gains that can be passed along the supply chain and in part by using the Internet as the primary procurement channel.</p>
        <p>Management is likely to expound on its digital strategy at a June 14 meeting with analysts in New York. Most expect the new chief executive, Daniel A. Carp, who replaced George M. C. Fischer in January, to be more aggressive in raising the market's awareness of the breadth of the company's e-commerce initiatives.</p>
        <p>Clayton M. Christensen, the Harvard Business School professor who coined the term ''disruptive technology,'' for emerging technology that threatens the status quo, said it applied to the digital imaging arena. As for Kodak's understanding of the stakes, he said, ''I think management gets it.''</p>
