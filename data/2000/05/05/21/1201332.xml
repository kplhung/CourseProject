        <p>It was almost like a support group for people who had become obsessively dependent on their hand-held BlackBerry wireless Internet devices. New York businessmen were standing up, declaring ''I'm a BlackBerry-a-holic.'' One even acknowledged that he couldn't stop checking his e-mail throughout the recent event that prompted such confessions -- a speech by James Balsillie, the BlackBerry creator and chairman of Research In Motion Ltd.</p>
        <p>''I check my e-mail a couple of hundred times a day,'' Mr. Balsillie said at the New York InfoTech Forum. ''I don't think BlackBerry causes obsessive behavior, but it definitely does give obsessive people an outlet.'' His wife, however, has objected. ''I'm definitely banned from using my BlackBerry at the dinner table,'' he said, though he still uses it in the bathtub.</p>

        <p>Though his company's stock has fallen from a high of $175.75 on Feb. 28 to $33.9375 on Friday, Mr. Balsillie swears that he never puts his BlackBerry to one obvious use. ''I've never once in my life checked the stock price,'' he said.</p>
