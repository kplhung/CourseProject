        <p>''I'm not a military general, a business guru, not a philosopher or author; it's only me and I'm one of you,'' said Vin Scully, the sportscaster for the Dodgers since before they deserted Brooklyn, who avoided a weighty commencement speech yesterday and entertained Fordham University's class of 2000 with a series of humble anecdotes.</p>
        <p>Driven from the great green quadrangle of the Edwards Parade Ground by wind and rain, the graduates, their friends and their families were packed into a gymnasium on the university's Rose Hill campus in the Bronx for Fordham's 155th commencement ceremony.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scully recounted how he had wanted to be a broadcaster since he first listened to the radio at the age of 8, and once fantasized that a classmate would become a major-league ballplayer and that he would one day announce a game that his buddy played in. And one day it happened. ''What are the odds of that?'' he asked. ''Sometimes even the wildest dreams come true.''</p>
        <p>In his speech, Mr. Scully referred to a disappointing audience with the pope, spun a tale of an Indian chief's test of his braves, and rattled off a comedic dialogue between Sir Laurence Olivier and the playwright Noel Coward meeting on a London street corner.</p>
        <p>All of that led Mr. Scully to urge the graduates to ''leave some gaps in your life so you can do something spontaneous, rather than being led by the arm.''</p>
        <p>Fordham conferred 1,253 undergraduate degrees and 2,513 graduate diplomas yesterday. Those who received honorary doctorates were: Mr. Scully; Rose Marie Bravo, the chief executive of Burberry's, the British clothing firm; Mary Ann Quaranta, dean of the Fordham University Graduate School of Social Service; Brother Richard J. Curry, Society of Jesus, founder of the National Theater Workshop of the Handicapped; and Gen. John M. Keane, vice chief of staff of the United States Army.</p>
        <p>Marist College</p>
        <p>Chuckling at the chill rain that seemed to only increase in ferocity the longer he spoke, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska urged 1,251 Marist College graduates yesterday to  remember the innocence of their youth and not to believe that they were ''immune to the forces of nature.''</p>
        <p>He asked them never to ''shut down, turn up the music'' in their cars and stop listening to the larger world.</p>
        <p>Outside the college gates in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., that world was already making itself known. A dozen antiabortion demonstrators who had arrived to denounce the senator's support for abortion rights held up signs that accused Mr. Kerrey of supporting infanticide. Among the protesters was Theodora S. Budnick, a physician and a member of the college's board of trustees.</p>
        <p>''We make a big deal about our Catholic heritage,'' Ms. Budnick said of the college, an independent liberal arts institution founded by the Marist Brothers in 1946. ''Yet we don't honor it.''</p>
        <p>The school conferred 963 bachelor's degrees and 288 graduate degrees. Among the graduates was Jaclyn DeRito, a business administration major who suffered a stroke in October 1998 but insisted on finishing her studies in time to graduate with the rest of her class.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerrey mentioned her in his speech as emblematic of the kind of character, courage and tenacity he would wish for all the graduates.</p>
        <p>Marist's 57th commencement coincided with the 50th anniversary of Armed Forces Day, and as Mr. Kerrey, a Vietnam veteran and recipient of the Medal of Honor, walked toward the podium, he stopped in front of a tree planted in honor of Marist alumni who had also served.</p>
