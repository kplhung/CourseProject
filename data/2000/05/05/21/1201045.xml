        <p>An oasis of calm -- in the form of a 105-acre wildlife reserve -- has been developed just seven miles from the bustle of the center of London. Opening Friday, the Wetlands Center has been created by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, a conservation charity, around four unused reservoirs in Barnes, a West London suburb.</p>
        <p>The center is divided into three areas. The Sir Peter Scott Visitor Center -- named for the painter and naturalist -- includes an observatory, multimedia displays, an art gallery, a restaurant, and a gift shop. The gallery will be devoted to painting, sculpture and photography of wildlife, opening with a retrospective of Sir Peter's work.</p>

        <p>An oasis of calm -- in the form of a 105-acre wildlife reserve -- has been developed just seven miles from the bustle of the center of London. Opening Friday, the Wetlands Center has been created by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, a conservation charity, around four unused reservoirs in Barnes, a West London suburb.</p>
        <p>The center is divided into three areas. The Sir Peter Scott Visitor Center -- named for the painter and naturalist -- includes an observatory, multimedia displays, an art gallery, a restaurant, and a gift shop. The gallery will be devoted to painting, sculpture and photography of wildlife, opening with a retrospective of Sir Peter's work.</p>
        <p>The two-floor observatory is the key area to view the entire site, and visitors can use  telescopes there or rent binoculars. There will also be four screens showing films of different areas of the reserve.</p>
        <p>The visitor center also includes re-creations of habitats, like a peat bog, a coral reef and a mangrove swamp as well as a science lab with more interactive exhibits.</p>
        <p>Outside, the World Wetlands area shows 14 wetland habitats from around the world, with examples of wildfowl from each -- from coniferous forests to tundra to a New Zealand white water exhibit, which will include the endangered blue duck.</p>
        <p>The third area, Waterlife, is devoted to Britain's wetland habitats. Among the wildlife already recorded on the site are noctule bats, small copper butterflies, kingfishers, common and green sandpipers, redshanks and black-tailed godwits.</p>
        <p>World Wetlands, Queen Elizabeth's Walk, London SW13 9SF, is open daily. Admission is $10.25, $6.30 for ages 4 to 16, at $1.60 to the pound. Information: (44-020) 8409-4400.</p>
