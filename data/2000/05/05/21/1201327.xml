        <p>To the high-technology industry, China is a vast emerging market that is virtually out of reach. Analysts estimate that China will soon be one of the three largest markets for computers, software and Internet products. While companies like Motorola, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have some operations there, they say Chinese regulations and lax intellectual property protections significantly interfere with their ability to do business.</p>
        <p>If the trade bill does not pass, the industry says, China will become a World Trade Organization member but will not be treated as such by the United States and thus will not have to follow the group's rules when dealing with Washington.</p>
        <p>''What we negotiated will go to our non-American competitors,'' said James F. Whittaker, chairman of the U.S. High Tech Coalition on China, a lobbying group based in Washington. ''We will be at a severe disadvantage in one of the most important markets in the world.''</p>
        <p>Critics, including labor organizations, are concerned that high-technology companies will exploit China's large pool of skilled engineers and weak labor protections and move jobs overseas. Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman, noted, however, that while 60 percent of Intel's revenues came from abroad, 70 percent of its work force was in the United States. ''Success in China,'' he said, ''can help create jobs in the United States.''</p>
        <p>Telecommunications is also seen as a potential bonanza for American companies. Arthur L. Kobler, president of the China operation for AT&amp;T, expects China's roughly $50 billion communications market to double by 2004, fueled largely by an explosion in wireless telephone use.</p>
        <p>''Sometime this year or next year, China will become the second-largest wireless market, behind the United States but ahead of Japan,'' Mr. Kobler said. ''China is a market that you cannot not be in.''</p>
        <p>For now, though, China's extensive restrictions on foreign business operations severely limit American high-technology and telecommunications companies. Foreign-made products are subject to high tariffs. Yet foreign companies that want to produce in China face restrictions on what parts they can buy from abroad and are permitted to distribute their products within China only through local distributors. State-owned enterprises control a significant share of the trade in electronics goods, and American companies complain that they give preference to higher-cost Chinese suppliers.</p>
        <p>That could change soon. In the bilateral pact reached in November, China agreed to phase out tariffs and other restrictions and to immediately become subject to the W.T.O.'s patent and copyright rules. That provides tremendous opportunities not only to the United States but also to China, said David I. Levine, a professor at the Walter A. Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
        <p>''High tech,'' he said, ''is one instance of the general theory that if you want to learn from the rest of the world, you trade with them.''</p>
        <p>Communications services are likely to be an important part of that trade. Moreover, the opportunity to sell services to Chinese businesses and consumers may well be surpassed by the chance to win over big foreign corporations that want to link their Chinese operations with their other units.</p>
