        <p>Throughout their Senate primary race, former Gov. Jim Florio has defied political custom by deliberately running to the right of Jon S. Corzine on several issues of particular importance to Democratic voters.</p>
        <p>He says he supports the death penalty and believes in the biblical eye for an eye, while Mr. Corzine opposes capital punishment, likening it to the ultimate form of racial profiling.</p>
        <p>He ridicules Mr. Corzine's proposals for new spending on health care, education and long-term care as unrealistic, ultraliberal and unaffordable.</p>
        <p>And last Tuesday night, in their third debate, Mr. Florio pointedly said that he opposed gay marriages.</p>
        <p>''This is one of those issues on which Jon and I disagree directly,'' he said, in response to a question from an audience member at a synagogue in Livingston. ''Maybe it's generational, or whatever it happens to be, I just do not think that marriage is able to be certified between two people of the same sex.''</p>
        <p>It was a somewhat surprising statement from Mr. Florio, who in 1992 signed amendments to the state's civil rights law banning discrimination based on sexual orientation, making New Jersey only the fifth state in the country with such protections for gays and lesbians.</p>
        <p>But it cast a momentary spotlight on the behind-the-scenes wrangling between the Florio and Corzine camps for the support of the state's gay and lesbian voters, who after years of struggling merely to organize in a state with no defined gay urban center are now beginning to test their political muscles.</p>
        <p>New Jersey's gay and lesbian residents live everywhere from Hoboken to Plainfield to Lambertville and a thousand subdivisions in between. And they have seldom voted as a bloc, said Robert Bailey, a Rutgers professor who wrote ''Gay Politics, Urban Politics.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Bailey said gays and lesbians made up an estimated 5 or 6 percent of Democratic primary voters in New Jersey, a number that could rise depending on a candidate's outreach efforts. ''You can't win a Democratic primary in New York City without winning a portion of the gay vote,'' he said. ''That's not the case in New Jersey. But you can understand why it'd be nuts not to seek the vote out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, who as co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company extended health benefits to employees' domestic partners, has sought the gay vote assiduously, beginning with the choice of Steven Goldstein, who is openly gay, as a co-campaign manager. Mr. Goldstein also helped draft a 20-point position paper on gay and lesbian rights in which Mr. Corzine expressed support for the right of gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military, and for the New Jersey court ruling barring the Boy Scouts from excluding gay members, among other issues.</p>
        <p>That effort apparently paid off. In March, Mr. Corzine held a fund-raiser in New York that was attended by a Who's Who of gays and lesbians both in New Jersey and at Goldman, Sachs. The event was a virtual coronation for Mr. Corzine; Laquetta Nelson, the founder of a new group called New Jersey Stonewall Democrats, said that night that she expected the group would endorse Mr. Corzine soon after. Indeed, in early April the group voted to support Mr. Corzine.</p>
        <p>The value of that endorsement, like many others in this closely fought Senate race, was difficult to gauge. The vote was only 5 to 1. But Ms. Wilson said she planned to spread the word to 5,000 New Jersey residents on her mailing list.</p>
        <p>Fast forward to Tuesday night, where Mr. Florio painted himself as the more conservative candidate on the issue of gay rights.</p>
        <p>In truth, the gap between Mr. Florio and Mr. Corzine on gay marriage is so subtle as to sound indistinguishable. In essence, Mr. Florio supports private contracts that would extend the legal benefits of marriage to same-sex couples. He just would not permit the state to grant two men or two women a marriage license. Mr. Corzine would go that extra but, in some eyes, inconsequential step.</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Goldstein conceded as much. ''Both candidates are good on gay issues,'' he said. ''The difference is that Jon has courted the community's vote from the start, and made the lesbian and gay community feel like it was part of his coalition rather than some afterthought.''</p>
        <p>But Wendy Berger, president of the New Jersey Lesbian and Gay Coalition, called Mr. Florio's remarks disappointing and accused him of pandering to Democrats who are hostile to gay rights. ''He doesn't think he's getting the gay vote, so he's going to run as the less liberal guy,'' Ms. Berger said. ''He's using gay people to make himself look more palatable to mainstream voters, which I think is disgusting.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Berger, who said her own coalition does not endorse but does educate voters, said a perfect leafletting opportunity would be a popular Pride event in Asbury Park scheduled for the weekend before primary day. ''If we were sitting on the fence, and attempting to be respectful to Jim Florio with respect to his signing of the civil rights bill, he certainly has given us permission to get off the fence and support Corzine,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio, in the meantime, excoriated Mr. Corzine for saying last Tuesday that he supported civil union among gay partners without using the marriage word. ''He's trying to have the best of both worlds,'' Mr. Florio said. ''He's telling people what they want to hear in the gay community, and then obfuscating before the general public.''</p>
