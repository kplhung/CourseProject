        <p>APPROACHING Rat's for the first time, you might think you'd wandered into one of those senseless, antic dreams from which you wake up giggling. The road from Interstate 295, which seems headed for nothing more enticing than a wasteland of industrial parks on the bedraggled outskirts of Trenton, turns out to be lined with larger-than-life contemporary sculptures, including a superrealistic molar as big as a bungalow. Just when you think you've gotten hopelessly lost amid the corporate clutter, you find yourself on an island of greenery dotted with still more sculpture, much of it lifted from French Impressionist paintings.

        <p>This is Grounds for Sculpture, a 22-acre oasis carved out of the old New Jersey State Fairgrounds by the astonishingly eccentric sculptor and pharmaceutical heir J.

        <p>APPROACHING Rat's for the first time, you might think you'd wandered into one of those senseless, antic dreams from which you wake up giggling. The road from Interstate 295, which seems headed for nothing more enticing than a wasteland of industrial parks on the bedraggled outskirts of Trenton, turns out to be lined with larger-than-life contemporary sculptures, including a superrealistic molar as big as a bungalow. Just when you think you've gotten hopelessly lost amid the corporate clutter, you find yourself on an island of greenery dotted with still more sculpture, much of it lifted from French Impressionist paintings. And a sign that says, ''Welcome to Rat's.'' Where on earth are you?</p>
        <p>This is Grounds for Sculpture, a 22-acre oasis carved out of the old New Jersey State Fairgrounds by the astonishingly eccentric sculptor and pharmaceutical heir J. Seward Johnson Jr. Before we get to the restaurant, a short course in Mr. Johnson's art: serious critics have dismissed it as kitsch, and it's hard to argue with them; what else do you call a weirdly lifelike re-creation of Manet's ''Dejeuner sur l'Herbe,'' lovingly rendered in hand-painted bronze? That molar is his, too, and so is the buxom, nightgown-clad lady of the house who greets restaurantgoers from a lighted second-story window, prompting double takes and guffaws.</p>
        <p>But here's where Mr. Johnson, who turned 70 last month, gets the last laugh: It works. It would be hard to overstate the audaciousness of this place -- from the incongruity of the setting to the spirited silliness of much of the artwork to the opulence of the landscaping (manmade ponds, Monet-inspired bridges) to the name of the restaurant itself. On paper, it's a recipe for a theme park, a rich man's ego trip -- Johnson World. But Mr. Johnson's vision is so big, so original, so playful and carried off with so much attention to detail that it succeeds dazzlingly. And the restaurant, which is an intrinsic part of the vision, is not far behind.</p>
        <p>The name, of course, was Mr. Johnson's idea, taken from the loyal and charming host in Kenneth Grahame's ''Wind in the Willows.'' ('' 'There's a banquet for you!' observed the Rat, as he arranged the table. 'I know some animals who would give their ears to be sitting down to supper with us tonight!' '') From the time he opened Grounds for Sculpture, in 1992, Mr. Johnson spoke of including a world-class restaurant where art lovers could enjoy a fine meal in a village inspired by Monet's Giverny. The idea must have sounded just as improbable as everything else about the grounds, but he stuck with it, hired architects, builders, consultants and a chef, and opened his restaurant last January.</p>
        <p>Rat's is as gorgeous as its setting. Housed in a sprawling re-creation of a Giverny-like inn, it has five dining rooms with 110 seats on two levels, several of them with fireplaces that perfume it with wood smoke on chilly evenings. (In warmer weather, Rat's will begin serving on a patio overlooking one of Mr. Johnson's ponds.)  The floors and beams are weathered wood salvaged from old barns and factories, and the rugs and furniture and tableware might have been salvaged from the 18th-century bed and breakfast of your dreams. Tables are so comfortably spaced that I barely noticed a wheelchair gliding by.</p>
        <p>The restaurant is not yet hitting on all cylinders. In three recent visits, I had two superb meals and one that was disappointingly ordinary -- all the more disappointing because prices are among the highest in the state, averaging $80 for a dinner with wine, tax and tip. (Lunch prices are considerably lower.) Still, there's so much to like about Rat's that I'd send anyone there for a special occasion. Others clearly have the same idea: it can take six weeks to get a reservation on a Saturday night.</p>
        <p>The chef is Eric Martin, a 32-year-old graduate of the Culinary Institute of America who has worked with prominent chefs like Daniel Boulud, Christian Delouvrier and Joel Robuchon in France and the United States. (His previous restaurant was the well-regarded Stage Left, in New Brunswick.) His cooking is seldom spectacular but beautifully balanced, firmly anchored in his French and American training but contemporary in its love for other cultures and fresh ingredients.</p>
        <p>Consider the darne of salmon, a fresh and tender piece of fish seared with Asian spices, sitting on a bed of jasmine rice in a moat of intense ponzu vinaigrette with shiitake and tree-ear mushrooms. The flavors are elemental but unexpected, surprisingly well balanced. Another main course, very different but working on the tastebuds in a similar way, is a meaty grilled portobello mushroom on a slab of polenta, with roasted onions and peppers and a splendid culinary flourish: deep-fried zucchini blossoms stuffed with goat cheese.</p>
        <p>Long before the entrees comes a giveaway appetizer, not only different each night but often different from diner to diner. ''I like to have fun,'' said Mr. Martin, and he does: one night he might offer ham and eggs -- little slices of mild ham topped with a fried quail egg -- and another a mini-hamburger, complete with a tiny pickle and a doll-sized sesame bun. (Pull up a chair, Mr. Mole.)</p>
        <p>Appetizers can be equally playful, or quite serious. A salad of baby vegetables -- beets, turnips, pattypan squash, zucchini, eggplant, depending on what's available -- comes with an intense truffled vinaigrette and fresh herbs. The carpaccio -- translucent slices of pleasantly mild raw meat -- is buffalo, not beef. A light and summery salad of peekytoe crab is served with several kinds of melon in an elegant cucumber dish. A black-bean salad redolent of chipotle mayonnaise comes with two good-sized chunks of lobster meat in a crisp tortilla basket; though sensational one night, on another it was strangely tepid and soggy from too much dressing.</p>
        <p>With one exception, Mr. Martin shows a particularly sure hand with fish. Besides that darne of salmon, he turns out a wonderful saute of pistachio-crusted wolffish, and his diver scallops -- the biggest I've ever seen -- are coated with panko breadcrumbs and perfectly grilled. The exception was Dover sole meuniere, a special one recent weeknight: after being sauteed in the kitchen, it was finished tableside in a pointless ceremony that added nothing, as far as I could see, but an overdose of butter and perhaps a few dollars to the price.</p>
        <p>The accompaniments to these dishes are seasonal and imaginative. It's possible to forgive almost anything of a chef who uses ramps, the gamy spring onions of the Eastern Seaboard, and they turn up in at least two entrees every night in spring -- the wolffish and a grilled beef tenderloin, in a dark and satisfying sauce of caramelized radicchio. (Later on, Mr. Martin says, he will pickle the ramp bulbs and find a place for them on his summer menu.)</p>
        <p>Wolffish, panko, ramp, ponzu, darne -- you can expand your vocabulary in a hurry at Rat's, and your servers will be happy to help. While some of them are clearly learning the ropes, they are friendly and accommodating. And the wine steward, Anthony Accardo, is more than accommodating -- he appears to love his collection like a father, but he proved a willing accomplice in bargain hunting. Twice he steered me to terrific bottles at the bottom of the price list, both unknown to me: a Miner zinfandel from California ($25) and a Serge Dagueneau Pouilly-Fume from France ($30).</p>
        <p>The pastry chef, Peter Max Dierkes, turns out a line of sweets that are worth saving room for, particularly a hot Valrhona chocolate cake, a sour-cherry crisp perfectly set off by a little ball of smoky green-tea ice cream, and a banana-and-banana-cake tower that's as winsomely silly (and as tasty) as the sculptures outside.</p>
        <p>It was too bad about that off night -- something that great restaurants, like great musicians, are just not permitted to have. Still, something remarkable is going on in that green sculptured oasis in the industrial sprawl east of Trenton. In its fifth month of existence, Rat's is already close to gaining a place in New Jersey's tiny circle of extraordinary restaurants.</p>
