        <p>ON half a dozen nights in the last two weeks, tuxedoed men have whispered discreetly into telephones, and gavels have rapped down in brightly lighted rooms where the earnest business of the big spring art auctions was taking place.</p>
        <p>The scene was wildly different, however, on Monday evening at Christie's. Foam spewed from bubble machines suspended above the building's canopy at Rockefeller Plaza, as 900 guests arrived for a party called the Bubble Bash.

        <p>ON half a dozen nights in the last two weeks, tuxedoed men have whispered discreetly into telephones, and gavels have rapped down in brightly lighted rooms where the earnest business of the big spring art auctions was taking place.</p>
        <p>The scene was wildly different, however, on Monday evening at Christie's. Foam spewed from bubble machines suspended above the building's canopy at Rockefeller Plaza, as 900 guests arrived for a party called the Bubble Bash. ''I hope it's not a reference to any bubbles bursting on Wall Street,'' said Jill Spalding, an immaculately groomed guest, sidestepping a volley of descending bubbles.</p>
        <p>Inside, to the astonishment of many longtime auctiongoers, lights were dimmed and disco music was booming. Tom Finn, the D.J., described his playlist as ''sexy, modern, with a combo of R.&amp;B., ambient groove and acid jazz.'' In the crepuscular light, it was virtually impossible to see the high-priced artworks, which were to be sold the following evening, including the inspiration for the bubble theme, ''Woman in a Tub,'' a 1988 sculpture by Jeff Koons. (It went for $1.71 million.)</p>
        <p>In a second room, the only discernible source of light was the spectral glow emanating from another Koons sculpture, consisting of two vacuum cleaners mounted in a plexiglass box, garishly illuminated by white fluorescent bulbs. While many seemed amused by the nightclub atmosphere, others were aghast. ''It's a horror,'' said Holly Solomon, the art dealer. ''It's so dark, you can't even get picked up.''</p>
        <p>With Christie's, Sotheby's and now Phillips battling for supremacy in the auction world, the crucial May sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art produced weeks of record prices. At Sotheby's, new highs were recorded for Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still and Bruce Nauman, and at Christie's records were set for 15 contemporary artists. Phillips, whose new owner, Bernard Arnault, spent lavishly to get into the big-time-auctions game, was embarrassed by the house's lackluster Impressionist and modern sale, but Phillips saved face with a successful contemporary sale, including a record $552,500 for the cows-in-formaldehyde school of Damien Hirst.</p>
        <p>The competition was not only in the sales rooms. It was equally frenzied during the grueling round of cocktail parties and dinners given by all three houses to promote the sales, which left many art lovers reeling from social exhaustion.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's alone held 16 promotional events between May 4 and May 16, including a populist Sunday brunch and an intimate boardroom dinner to cultivate major donors to the Dia Center for the Arts.</p>
        <p>''This is the time when it's just crazy,'' Ms. Solomon said. Her Monday night peregrinations included, besides the Bubble Bash, a cocktail reception at Phillips's temporary headquarters in the American Crafts Museum and a dinner for 250 guests afterward at Asia de Cuba, where stalks of green bamboo sprouted roofward from a buffet table and waiters urged cosmopolitans upon arriving guests.</p>
        <p>The lavish socializing may seem a sideshow, but it is actually crucial to how auction houses market themselves, by providing an overlay of glamour and social standing to what is essentially a highfalutin swap meet. Especially in New York, the multimillion-dollar auction world dominated by Sotheby's and Christie's has long offered the chance to join in the social swim.</p>
        <p>This is not serendipitous but part of their business strategies. New-money buyers get to rub shoulders with old-money sellers. The slightly tawdry business of liquidating estates after death and divorce is given the cultural and social gloss of the museum or art-gallery world.</p>
        <p>''Client entertaining is a huge, important focus of our business,'' said Andree Corroon, a spokeswoman for Christie's. She's not fooling. Christie's has held approximately 450 social and cultural events in the last year. During the same period, Sotheby's held 528 parties in its newly expanded York Avenue headquarters, including breakfasts, dinners and teas, said Mallory Andrews, senior vice president for event marketing at Sotheby's. Neither house would disclose the cost of such prodigious entertaining.</p>
        <p>Phillips, long an also-ran behind the two other houses, declared its desire to compete this season by paying handsomely for major works to sell and by renovating the crafts museum for $1.3 million. But no less did the once-fusty British firm venture into the world of heavyweight party-giving.</p>
        <p>To promote its Impressionist and modern sale, Phillips gave a dinner for 120 on May 7 in association with the Society of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the charity committee with perhaps the swellest social standing in town. In the two-story Magic Room of the LVMH Tower, Sloan-Kettering supporters like Pat Buckley, Nan Kempner, Carroll Petrie and Julia and David Koch were served roast lamb and plentiful Moet Chandon in a room decorated with 20 mandarin and oleander trees, to evoke ''Environs de Gardanne,'' a Cezanne painting that brought $5.62 million in its Impressionist sale. Christopher Thompson, the chairman of Phillips, lured his dinner committee out of their triplexes and country houses by donating $200,000 to the cancer center.</p>
        <p>''As a rule, I never leave this place on weekends, and certainly not on a Sunday night,'' Mrs. Buckley said, referring to her Connecticut house.</p>
        <p>''But for $200,000? Certainly.''</p>
        <p>Phillips's dinner at Asia de Cuba eight nights later to promote its contemporary sale was an entirely different affair. The guest list was a haut bohemian crowd, including Marlon Richards, a son of Keith Richards; the models Karen Elson and Amy Wesson; the Schnabel sisters, Jacqueline and Stella; and the artist Damian Loeb.</p>
        <p>The host for the evening was Jade Jagger, 28, the formidably beautiful daughter of Bianca and Mick. Phillips took the remarkable step of flying Ms. Jagger and her boyfriend, Dan Macmillan, a grandson of former Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, from London on the Concorde.</p>
        <p>Phillips also treated Ms. Jagger to the sleeveless Christian Dior gown she wore, another of the luxury brands in the portfolio of Mr. Arnault's LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. Ms. Jagger is a demicelebrity in England, where she designs jewelry and is an occasional fashion model, but her connection to the high stakes world of art auctions was tenuous. And among the youthful revelers at her party, potential bidders for serious art seemed few and far between.  An exception was the fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez, who bid successfully on Friday for a black and white painting by Udomsak Krisanamis.</p>
        <p>Through all the parties, hardly anyone mentioned the Justice Department investigation of price-fixing at Christie's and Sotheby's. The scandal may have led to the resignation of Sotheby's chairman and its chief executive, but you would never have known it from the banter of partygoers. In fact, the taint muddying the image of both houses may have added impetus to their party-giving departments to pour on the revelry.</p>
        <p>While the events at Christie's -- traditionally the more conservative firm -- are fewer in number than those of its chief rival, there are considerably more than are held at the London-based company's King Street headquarters. When Ed Dolman, the company's chief executive, arrived from England a few years ago, one Christie's executive recalled, he expressed bewilderment at the number of parties at Christie's in New York.</p>
        <p>''It's what people expect, so we can't cut back, exactly,'' the executive said, noting that officials at Christie's are keenly aware of the gangbusters entertaining going on at Sotheby's.</p>
        <p>''Listen, if you're Bergdorf's, you always want to know what Barneys is doing,'' said Ms. Andrews, who held event-planning jobs at both stores before bringing her skills to the no less rivalrous terrain of auction house entertaining. ''There's always a sense of competition.''</p>
        <p>The news that Christie's and Phillips had hired D.J.'s to enliven their Monday night parties raised eyebrows at Sotheby's. ''We are not a discotheque,'' said Tobias Meyer, Sotheby's worldwide head of contemporary art, explaining that a dinner held at the firm's York Avenue headquarters on Tuesday night would be disco-free.</p>
        <p>''But we know how to dance,'' added Lisa Paulson, his deputy in the contemporary department.</p>
        <p>''It's froth,'' Mr. Tobias continued, rolling his eyes, ''and we try to be serious. At the end of the day, art is a serious business.''</p>
        <p>With an eye to serious future business, Sotheby's was giving a dinner that evening for 130 young guests invited by Serena Boardman and Jane Lauder at its vast new museumlike 10th-floor galleries, where artworks, including a Mark Rothko painting (later sold for $14.3 million) were on display. Befitting the occasion, Ms. Boardman and Ms. Lauder, young women from socially powerful New York families, had compiled a guest list that was a veritable Who's Who of young, affluent New York, including a royal flush of Miller sisters, de Kwiatkowski siblings, Eliza Reed, Rena Sindi and the ubiquitous contemporary art consultant Kim Heirston.</p>
        <p>Despite the substantial heft of the combined bank accounts of those in the room, however, few seemed likely candidates for big bids at Sotheby's auction the following night, when Mr. Meyer brought down the hammer on $46.1 million of contemporary art.</p>
        <p>Katherine Ross, a senior vice president for museum services at Sotheby's, who also chairs Young Collectors Council -- a group of 12 socially active employees at the firm who cultivate future Sotheby's clients -- said that immediate sales gratification, while certainly welcome, was not a priority.</p>
        <p>Did Sotheby's expect its young guests to be big bidders at the Wednesday night and Thursday morning sales? Ms. Ross shook her head. ''It's about long-term cultivation,'' she said. ''We don't expect to see the results immediately.'' At Sotheby's, she noted, ''I don't have to prove purchasing activity after every event. It's really about the future.''</p>
