        <p>PEOPLE who remember the movies of the 1930's and 40's the first time around are always saying that today's explicit sex scenes aren't half as erotic as the subtle gestures of yesteryear. Feeling the electricity when Daniel Day-Lewis finally touches Michelle Pfeiffer's hand in THE AGE OF INNOCENCE (1993) makes the argument pretty convincing. It's Edith Wharton's story of 1870's New York society - a countess with a past, a true gentleman wildly attracted to her and his seemingly delicate baby fiancee (Winona Ryder in steel-magnolia mode), who simply isn't going to let that happen. If Martin Scorsese could make a film like this, why doesn't he direct more movies with pretty people and elegant fashions and gorgeous interiors? - Monday at 3:45 p.m. and Saturday at 2 p.m. on Showtime.</p>

        <p>PEOPLE who remember the movies of the 1930's and 40's the first time around are always saying that today's explicit sex scenes aren't half as erotic as the subtle gestures of yesteryear. Feeling the electricity when Daniel Day-Lewis finally touches Michelle Pfeiffer's hand in THE AGE OF INNOCENCE (1993) makes the argument pretty convincing.

        <p>All those people flocking to see ''Frequency,'' about a man who manages to talk to his father (Dennis Quaid) 30 years in the past, should visit or revisit Francis Coppola's PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED (1986). Kathleen Turner's experiences - as a woman who goes to a class reunion, faints and wakes up back in 1960 with all her high school friends, her parents younger than she could ever remember them and her grandparents still alive - is so poignant it hurts. Nicolas Cage is in fine form too as the vulnerable boyfriend who worships Fabian and reams of a future he is never going to have - Saturday at 3:05 p.m. on TNT.</p>
        <p>Judith Traherne is the original irresponsible rich girl, until she learns she has a brain tumor and grows up fast. Critics recognized immediately that DARK VICTORY (1939) was a Bette Davis tour de force, even if she had won an Oscar just the year before, for ''Jezebel.'' Edmund Goulding directed, George Brent plays the surgeon who falls in love with Judith, and the ending has to be the most physically flattering death scene ever filmed - Wednesday at midnight on TCM.</p>
        <p>If there were scads of space aliens already among us, trying to go unnoticed, of course they'd be living in New York. Where else? In Barry Sonnenfeld's hysterically funny sci-fi comedy MEN IN BLACK (1997), Tommy Lee Jones is the unflappable top-secret government agent assigned to keeping the aliens out of trouble and Will Smith is chosen as his successor. The film reveals that a large number of extraterrestrials do duty-free shopping before leaving the planet and that the World's Fair grounds in Flushing are not going to waste after all - Monday at 8 p.m. on Channel 4.</p>
        <p>And if that isn't enough Barry Sonnenfeld for you, try a double feature of THE ADDAMS FAMILY (1991) and ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES (1993). Anjelica Huston and Raul Julia play Charles Addams's ghoulish cartoon couple, taking over from Carolyn Jones and John Astin of the television series. But the discovery of the films was Christina Ricci, at age 11, as Wednesday, the Addamses' preternaturally self-possessed and morbid daughter. The first film has to be appreciated as a single joke, since it has no discernible plot. The second is a winner, thanks to a playful script by Paul Rudnick and the appearance of Joan Cusack as the Addams baby's nanny, who plays innocent but soon absconds with Uncle Fester. Look for Nathan Lane in a tiny part as a station house cop (''Leave now. Don't make me call Ringling Brothers'') - Saturday at 2 p.m. and midnight (original film); Saturday at 4 p.m. and Saturday/Early Sunday at 2 a.m. (sequel) on USA.</p>
