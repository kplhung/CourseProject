        <p>BRICK and mortar is making a comeback. Elaborate brick and stone barbecue fireplaces are starting to appear in backyards around the region.</p>
        <p>''We began to have people asking for them about four years ago,'' said Trish Calabrese, office manager of Creative Stone Works, in Park Ridge. ''This year, there has been a huge increase. It's amazing what people are doing in their yards right now.''</p>
        <p>The booming economy is at least in part behind the resurgence of interest in these backyard behemoths.  Higher disposable income makes it possible, even desirable, to dress up the mundane things in life. ''The stonework has an Old World feeling, and it definitely looks a lot better than the plain, black-box gas grill,'' Ms. Calabrese said.</p>
        <p>There's some nostalgia involved, too. Simple but pleasant childhood memories often bring clients to the offices of stonemasons and landscape architects. During the planning stage, ''customers will mention the little old fireplaces, like they had in parks or in rest stops on the throughway,'' said Tom Ciccariello, owner of Seven Sons, a stone-working company in East Hampton, N.Y. ''For many of us, those cookouts were a big part of growing up.''</p>
        <p>But today's manifestation of those memories typically goes far beyond the basic wood-fired single-grill units of cookouts past.</p>
        <p>Cameron Brand, a certified landscape architect and office manager of Oliver Nurseries in Fairfield, views the stone barbecue as the open-air equivalent of a commercial range, saying, ''It's the Viking of outdoor products.''</p>
        <p>Florence Bogart, a landscape architect at Sprainbrook Nurseries in Scarsdale, N.Y., agrees. ''What I'm seeing is elaborate outdoor cooking spaces. Really, it's like an outdoor kitchen.''</p>
        <p>Most are fueled by natural gas, rather than wood or charcoal. And most are ''elaborate fireplaces tied to something, not just a lump of stone,'' Mr. Ciccariello said.</p>
        <p>There's an extensive wish list of things that can be tied to such a setup. The brick or stone barbecue might have a top-of-the-line stainless steel cooking unit with an enormous grilling surface, and be topped off with a tall chimney with a flue. Many cooking areas contain rotisseries, gas burners and a hooded cooking surface.</p>
        <p>''These are big, sophisticated units,'' Mr. Ciccariello said. ''People cook corn on the cob and lobster. You can have a clambake along with the grilled food.''</p>
        <p>Counters surrounding the cooking area are topped with marble, ceramic tile, granite, bluestone slate or Corian. Beneath those counters you might find built-in storage units or cabinets with wood or stainless steel doors. Other amenities include running water for wet bars or preparation sinks, under-counter refrigerators, and lighting fixtures.</p>
        <p>The surrounding area gets tied in, too. Because of its imposing size and stature, the barbecue is almost always the focal point in a landscaping plan, and its look is carried over into other elements in the yard. The cooking unit is sometimes built into a stone wall, or matching walls are built to shelter the cooking area.</p>
        <p>''It could be a seating wall, a retaining wall or a freestanding wall to separate, say, the lawn from the patio,'' Mr. Ciccariello said. ''It gives the sitting area more privacy. You can also add a stone table-a big slab of natural stone.''</p>
        <p>Granite-topped bench-style seating is another add-on.</p>
        <p>This may seem like a lot of trouble to go to, to cook outdoors twice a year. But that's not the case, said Matt Horn, owner of Matterhorn Nursery in Spring Valley, N.Y.</p>
        <p>''With gas, everyone's cooking outside, all year round,'' he said. ''These fireplaces are great for entertaining; they have a great ambience.  More people want to be outdoors, even if they only have a small area. People will sit out all evening. We're even installing some fire pits-people can sit around, cook, talk and be warm, even in the spring and fall.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Brand explained the attraction this way: ''It's a way of getting back to nature, even if you're outside a mansion. It's like being around the campfire; you can be at one with nature at the barbecue.''</p>
        <p>If you build it, they will come. And they will want to participate, too. ''When friends come over, cooking at the barbecue gets people involved,'' Mr. Ciccariello said. ''Everyone congregates around the grill and takes turns flipping.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brand said: ''When you have guests, it's much more social than standing around the stove inside. It's a very active way to cook. It gets you outside and gives you a feeling of participation in the gathering. It's a way for men to feel they're participating in the dinner hour, without feeling inept in front of the stove.''</p>
        <p>What's the bottom line on this wonderful combination of conspicuous consumption, nostalgia, ambience and bonding? ''These things are not cheap,'' Mr. Horn said. ''You might start at $10,000 for a decent one; allow about $4,000 for the mechanism, plus the masonry.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ciccariello said: ''It could be $6,000 to $14,000 for a grandiose project. It's a statement; it's not about function at that level. It's a hold on our past.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Calabrese said: ''Quality is a consideration over price. People want to get something that's going to last. I can't imagine people spending like this in the late-80's.''</p>
