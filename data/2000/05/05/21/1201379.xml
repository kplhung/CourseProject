        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton made it clear today that she has no intention of lashing out at her new competitor in the race for the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>For some weeks, her staff members have extensively researched the voting record and positions of United States Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island, the Republican candidate for the Senate. But after an appearance at the Boys and Girls Club of Northern Westchester, Mrs. Clinton mentioned the congressman in only the most cordial terms.</p>
        <p>''I would like to welcome Congressman Lazio into this race for the Senate,'' Mrs. Clinton said, reading more or less verbatim from a statement that had been released earlier by her campaign headquarters in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''I'm looking forward to a real discussion with him of the issues,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''Because if Congressman Lazio is the Republican nominee, there will be a clear difference between us on a number of issues, because we've taken very different stands on everything from education, to health care, to the future of the economy, to how we take care of our children, as well as our elderly citizens.''</p>
        <p>The statement offered no specifics about the differences between Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and Mr. Lazio, who is expected to be nominated at the Republican State Convention in Buffalo at the end of the month.</p>
        <p>But it offered a dramatic contrast in tone to Mr. Lazio's statement on his entrance into the race earlier today.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton first told reporters that she would take ''one or two questions,'' but after she read her statement, she left the podium and began shaking the hands of many of the roughly 250 people gathered at the Boys and Girls Club.</p>
        <p>While she walked along a roped-off area shaking hands, signing autographs and posing for photographs with guests, reporters occasionally asked about criticisms Mr. Lazio had made of her.</p>
        <p>In each case, she offered short responses. When asked about Mr. Lazio's depiction of her as an out-of-state politician, she said: ''We'll have plenty to talk about on the issues. That's what's important.''</p>
        <p>In part, Mrs. Clinton's aides explained, the cautious, almost congenial tone of the first lady's statement reflected her belief that there was no need to inject negativity into a campaign that has more than five months yet to run. As Mrs. Clinton said at the end of her statement, ''I think we'll have a lot of time in the next days and weeks and months to discuss those differences.''</p>
        <p>And with Mr. Lazio's emergence after Rudolph W. Giuliani withdrew Friday from the race, Mrs. Clinton concluded that there was little chance she could command the same level of media attention as the new Republican contender at that time, her aides said.</p>
        <p>Moreover, her aides said, Mrs. Clinton wished to stick with the kind of schedule in which she has been immersed over the last few weeks.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton came here today from her home in Chappaqua, about a 10-minute drive, to attend the club's Youth of the Year Award program, where she gave brief remarks extolling the Boys and Girls Club. From there, she traveled to a fund-raising reception, also in Westchester County. On Sunday, the first lady is to travel to Albany to attend a convention of the New York State Council of Machinists and a luncheon hosted by the Rensselaer County Democratic Committee.</p>
