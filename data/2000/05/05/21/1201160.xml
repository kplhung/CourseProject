        <p>What's your favorite place to go barefoot? Your best barefoot memory? Several well-known Long Islanders were asked where they let their feet hang out.</p>
        <p>STEVEN GAINES, WAINSCOTT  Author, ''Philistines at the Hedgerow''</p>
        <p>''When I was a kid, I never walked around barefoot because when I was 6 years old, a heavy tape-dispenser fell on my right toe and nipped off the tip.  Of course, you could hardly notice it, but being a kid I thought I was deformed, so I wore socks all the time, even in the ocean. When somebody on the beach asked why I wore socks, I said I didn't want to get my feet wet.</p>

        <p>STEVEN GAINES, WAINSCOTT  Author, ''Philistines at the Hedgerow''</p>
        <p>''When I was a kid, I never walked around barefoot because when I was 6 years old, a heavy tape-dispenser fell on my right toe and nipped off the tip.  Of course, you could hardly notice it, but being a kid I thought I was deformed, so I wore socks all the time, even in the ocean. When somebody on the beach asked why I wore socks, I said I didn't want to get my feet wet.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't until I was a teenager that I discovered the pleasures of walking barefoot on the sand, especially in the Hamptons, where the beaches are so pristine that the worst you can step on is some pedigree-pooch poo, not a broken syringe.</p>
        <p>''The best part of summer is being able to go barefoot out on the lawn and feel the coolness of the grass. It's freeing, it connects you with the earth and nature. To actually feel the different textures of the world under your feet is the way we were born to be.''</p>
        <p>BONNIE DIXON, SEA CLIFF  Director, Long Island Children's Museum</p>
        <p>''It has to be a warm summer night. The stars have to be out, no lights. I like to walk barefoot in the grass and feel the nightcrawlers squiggle under my feet. When I was a little girl, that was what I did. The reason we were in our bare feet was because we were going for nightcrawlers because we were going to go fishing the next day, and the best way to see a nightcrawler is to feel them.</p>
        <p>''I have another favorite place. I used to live in Gloucester, Mass. Some beaches are lovely and sandy and others are made out of muck. We had this wonderful black muck and we used to say we went to Mucky Beach. In some parts they are so mucky you'd sink in to your calves, and so when we'd come out -- the muck was black -- we'd have these black kneesocks. I loved that squish between my toes of Mucky Beach. And you wonder why I'm working in a children's museum!</p>
        <p>''I prefer to be barefoot than in shoes. It's a very tactile thing. It's just a way of sensing the world around you. You have to understand. I have a size-9 1/2 foot. I've always been in touch. I've had a firm foundation.''</p>
        <p>JUDITH JACOBS, SYOSSET  Presiding officer, Nassau County Legislature</p>
        <p>''In this world of fiscal strangulation in Nassau County, why do the feet seem to be a good thing to talk about? At least it gives us levity.</p>
        <p>Where do I like to walk most barefoot? Anyplace I can get away with it.</p>
        <p>''It includes all over my house, in my office when nobody is around and of course I love walking on the beach. I will do it anyplace I can get away with it, where I know there isn't a camera following me.</p>
        <p>''My favorite beach is Atlantic Beach. That's because ever since I was a little girl, we used to go to a beach club that's there. We have North Shore beaches in Oyster Bay and Bayville, and that is a more doable thing for me; I am closer to the North Shore than I am to the South, geographically.</p>
        <p>''A little bit more pebbly, not as smooth, not as comfortable as South Shore beaches, that's for sure.</p>
        <p>''There's one thing I've learned in politics: it's not whose toes you'd like to step on, but how you tiptoe around people that counts. My favorite barefoot story? When my 8-year-old granddaughter, Aimee, my oldest grandchild, was born. I saw the size of her little bare foot and realized the gift that I had just received.</p>
        <p>''It was unmatched by anything that had taken place prior that had anything to do with feet.''</p>
        <p>ALAN KING, KINGS POINT  Comedian</p>
        <p>''I've lived on Long Island in the same house for 40 years. I just go out in my so-called backyard and I walk barefoot. Not on the grass -- I'm worried about ticks, now -- but on the beach. We have some rocky and we have some sand, but I like to walk on the beach barefoot.</p>
        <p>''When I think about it, the place I like to walk barefoot is at home, in my house, on nice thick carpets. That's my favorite place.</p>
        <p>''My memory is always when I was kid in Brooklyn. Coney Island with 100 degrees and having to get from the towel to the beach where the skin came off at the bottom of my feet. Coney Island is a pleasant memory but the hot sand is very unpleasant.''</p>
        <p>TOM SUOZZI, GLEN COVE  Mayor</p>
        <p>''I like to go barefoot on our three public beaches -- Crescent, Pryibil and Morgan Park -- or at our two nature preserves, Welwyn and Garvies Point. But Garvies Point is a little too rocky.</p>
        <p>''I was barefoot during America's Sail in 1998. I climbed up the rigging on one of the tall slips and dove off into the water during a mock sea battle. It was really kind of dangerous. My feet were all bruised afterward from climbing the rigging.</p>
        <p>''I don't have very nice feet. I'm a shoe guy for the most part, but I wear Teva sandals. I am concerned every time I take my shoes off, I lose about 20 votes.</p>
        <p>''My wife, Helene, gives me foot massages.''</p>
        <p>RONA JAFFE, SAGAPONACK  Author, ''The Road Taken,'' her 16th book (coming out in June)</p>
        <p>''I like to walk barefoot around my house and at the edge of the ocean in the surf.</p>
        <p>''I remember when I was 2 years old and I used to go with my parents to the beach. I remember following my father's legs because I was about two feet tall, walking to the beach in Neponset. It was where the people from Brooklyn went.</p>
        <p>''I'm a shoe person because the streets are so dirty. You can't walk in the street. You can hardly wear sandals in New York City. For long-distance walking, you want to wear sneakers. I would never walk in the streets barefoot. It's very uncomfortable. You don't know what's on the street anyway. Then you have to look down. You might walk on God knows what. If you are in the beautiful country, you don't want to look down. so therefore you should wear shoes.</p>
        <p>''I read somewhere that you can tell a day tripper because they are walking in East Hampton in flip flops. Well, I wear flip flops and I live here. They are insulting our attire. What do they want us to wear in the summer in East Hampton? Prada shoes?</p>
        <p>''The joys of barefoot are different than they used to be, if they ever were different. I grew up in Brooklyn. You didn't walk barefoot there when I was a child. Nothing has changed.''</p>
        <p>WENDY VANDERBILT LEHMAN, WATER MILL  Painter and sculptor</p>
        <p>''I'm the original barefoot girl. If it weren't for cold or insulting a hostess, I'd be barefoot all the time. You can't turn up at a dinner party with bare feet.</p>
        <p>''I'm barefoot in my studio and close to it in the winter: I wear bedroom slippers and bare feet. I like to feel the ground. I like to drive barefoot.</p>
        <p>''I once had a new governess, a nanny, who lasted about three hours because she made me wear shoes on the beach. I got rid of her so fast. I was about 8.</p>
        <p>''I like being barefoot in my own house because it's my own territory and there are no surprises. And I love being barefoot on the beach and everywhere in between if it's not dangerous. My shoes are the first off and the last on as far as getting dressed goes.</p>
        <p>''There are not that many places you can be barefoot, but it's so nice when it's warmer out that you can do it and you can really feel where you are.</p>
        <p>''The trick to very hot sand -- if you get caught on that -- is to quickly dig under with your feet. The only problem is getting stuck where it's too hot. I'm even good on the gray gravel; it's a sort of Zen experience, you do Lamaze breathing as you go. It's a challenge, you're not going to give in.</p>
        <p>''The black asphalt can be tricky. Sometimes you have to go on the edges or in the shadows; that can get you in a lot of trouble. I won't embark on that unless it's a short distance.''</p>
        <p>THOMAS S. GULOTTA  Nassau County Executive</p>
        <p>Favorite place to go barefoot: Nassau Beach. Favorite summer memory: Walking with his wife and his dog at sunset on Nassau Beach. ''He tries not to step on other people's feet,'' said his press secretary, Caroline Smith.</p>
        <p>MATTHEW CROSSON  President, Long Island Association</p>
        <p>''Anyplace there are no geese.''</p>
