        <p>A 19-year-old Swedish au pair was raped early yesterday in the bathroom of an East Village restaurant by a man who had approached her and several friends in a nearby bar and then followed them when they left for the restaurant, the police said.</p>
        <p>A suspect was arrested about eight hours after the attack, which took place in the basement bathroom of the Pageant Bar and Grill, at 109 East Ninth Street. The man was charged with first-degree rape, assault and unlawful imprisonment.</p>
        <p>Detectives from the Manhattan Special Victims Squad, which investigates sex crimes, were able to find the suspect quickly because the bar requests identification from every patron and scans it into a computer. The suspect was identified through his driver's license photograph, said the police and the bar's manager, Anthony Zingarelli.</p>
        <p>The suspect had nearly been captured at the bar. The bouncers at Pageant pursued the man after the 1:15 a.m. attack, trapping him in an alley beside the restaurant, but he was able to climb a fire escape, jump to an adjacent rooftop and escape, the police said.</p>
        <p>The man, whom the police identified as David Andrew, 37, of 506 Eastern Parkway in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, was arrested at his home shortly after 9 a.m., the police said. Mr. Andrew told the police that he held two jobs, one at a Banana Republic store on West 34th Street and the second at a Duane Reade drugstore.</p>
        <p>The woman, who works for a family in New Jersey and whose name was withheld by the police because of the nature of the crime, was treated for trauma and bruises to her neck and wrists at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, the police said.</p>
        <p>According to the police, she was attacked after she left her friends -- four other Swedish au pairs and two men -- in the Pageant Bar to use the bathroom. The man followed the victim to the basement, pushed her into the bathroom and raped her, the police report said.</p>
        <p>The police said the man had initially approached the woman at Nevada Smith's, a nearby bar at 74 Third Avenue. When the victim and her friends left and walked to Pageant, he followed them, the police said.</p>
