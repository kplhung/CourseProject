        <p>Karl Marx</p>
        <p>A Life.</p>
        <p>By Francis Wheen.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 431 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>W. W. Norton &amp; Company. $27.95.</p>
        <p>When Karl Marx famously remarked that when history repeats itself, it arrives first as tragedy, then as farce, he was referring to the apparent reincarnation of great men as their own lesser disciples. The aphorism applies equally to Marx's incarnations as a biographical subject.</p>
        <p>The Marx portrayed by earlier writers like Isaiah Berlin, Edmund Wilson and David McLellan is a Promethean figure engaged in epic struggles against bourgeois gods. Now Francis Wheen, a writer for The Guardian and for the British humor magazine Private Eye, has given us a Marx who resembles Groucho, and whose torments -- from creditors and carbuncles to writer's block and the snubs of socialist rivals -- are usually self-inflicted. ''Paradox, irony and contradiction, the animating spirits of Marx's work, were also the impish trinity that shaped his own life,'' Wheen writes. Focusing on the private man rather than on his philosophy, Wheen hilariously contrasts the ''heroic appearance and inglorious reality -- stripping off the gallant knight's disguise to reveal a tubby little man in his underpants,'' a bit, in fact, the way Marx did when exposing capitalist scalawags, only more playfully and with greater compassion.</p>
        <p>While he hasn't dug up many new facts, Wheen has engagingly reinterpreted Marx's exhaustively annotated life. Like many armchair revolutionaries, Marx came from comfortably bourgeois circumstances. His forebears were German and Dutch rabbis, his father a social and religious liberal who converted to Protestantism to enhance his legal career. Born in 1818, Marx couldn't wait to get away from the stultifying atmosphere of his hometown, the ancient Rhineland city of Trier.</p>
        <p>While his mother nagged him (to no avail) to change his underwear at least once a week, his father treated his brilliant, self-confident son as an intellectual equal. By the time Marx was a 19-year-old, beer-swilling, dueling university student and spendthrift, his father, then dying of tuberculosis, admitted: ''I can only propose, advise. You have outgrown me.'' Marx returned the compliment by skipping his father's funeral a year later.</p>
        <p>Marx wisely grew whiskers soon after becoming a university student. Unkempt as he was, his ''magnificent Marxist plumage'' conspired to make him a man of destiny. ''The image of Karl Marx,'' Wheen writes, ''would lose much of its iconic resonance without that frizzy aureole.''</p>
        <p>His academic ambitions thwarted by the Prussian authorities, the newly minted doctor of philosophy turned to journalism. His next stop was Paris, where he edited a socialist broadsheet, having rejected Christianity, Hegelian idealism and constitutional democracy in rapid succession. But before departing for the City of Light, Marx married his longtime fiancee, the beautiful, aristocratic and terribly romantic Jenny von Westphalen, who once dreamed, in the spirit of Jane Eyre and Rochester, that Marx had lost his right hand, making her ''quite indispensable'' to him. In a preview of Marx's profound understanding of capital, the couple took the better part of Jenny's dowry -- a box of cash -- on their honeymoon, dispensing its contents freely to various indigents they happened to meet. The money was all gone in a week.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, while still in Paris, Marx met a tall, blond, dashingly handsome son of a textile manufacturer who was willing to become his guardian angel. Aptly, he was named Engels. Wheen wittily calls their first boozy conversation, which lasted a solid week and a half, ''10 days that shook the world.'' Engels, the author of an expose of the horrendous plight of Lancashire millworkers, introduced Marx, whose ''practical knowledge of capitalism was nil,'' to the dismal science.</p>
        <p>Tossed out of France, Marx moved on to Brussels, where he and Engels produced their own vision of the coming apocalypse, the Communist Manifesto, and otherwise devoted themselves to dropping verbal bombs on fellow socialists, a blunderbuss approach that Wheen compares to ''Prof. George Steiner attacking 'The Bridges of Madison County.' ''</p>
        <p>After the European revolutions of 1848 collapsed, Marx and his growing brood were forced to seek their final refuge in London. Unlike Engels, whose knowledge of the British working class was drawn from firsthand experience, Marx confined his investigations to the Reading Room of the British Museum.</p>
        <p>Living in Dickensian poverty with bailiffs at his door, Marx wrote letters to Engels that were a ''ceaseless litany of wretchedness and woe.'' Mostly, he scraped by on handouts from his friend, who, having joined the Manchester branch of his father's firm, sent a ''regular consignment of small-denomination bank notes, pilfered from the petty cash box.'' But Marx's dire straits, Wheen explains, were due in no small part to his desire to keep up appearances. While Jenny ran about frantically trying to raise a couple of pounds to pay for a coffin for one of their children, her husband employed a loutish, libidinous and thoroughly useless private secretary merely because he thought it unseemly for a man of his position to be without one.</p>
        <p>Thus, Wheen writes, Marx's mockery of bourgeois morals and manners belied the ''supremely bourgeois patriarch'' that he was. At home, Marx was a genuinely loving father and husband, generous to a fault when a windfall came his way, free of the jealousy and spite he displayed in the political arena. But he was no stranger to Victorian hypocrisy. When his housekeeper bore him a son -- three months after Jenny gave birth to their fourth child -- his first concern was his reputation. Engineering ''one of the first and most successful cover-ups ever organized for the greater good of the Communist cause,'' Marx got Engels to take the blame and made the woman give her 5-week-old infant up for adoption.</p>
        <p>As it happens, his magnum opus, ''Das Kapital,'' was not published until after 15 years of procrastination, fibbing and boasting about its progress. When the weighty tome failed to elicit the explosive response he anticipated, Marx compared himself to the hero of Balzac's ''Unknown Masterpiece,'' an artist who spends years refining and retouching a portrait until it becomes nothing but a formless mass of color and random lines. ''Nothing. Nothing. After 10 years of work,'' the artist cries.</p>
        <p>Wheen's portrait of Marx's life is artfully shaped and makes delectable reading. Alas, his breezy comedy takes an unintentionally farcical turn when he assesses Marx's ideas. Improbably asserting that all Marx's critics have either not read ''Das Kapital'' or else misread it, Wheen provides a capsule summary that is perversely selective and highly misleading. He insists that Marx's major economic and political predictions have stood the test of time. Hello? Capitalism has self-destructed? Socialist societies that have dispensed with markets and democracy have succeeded? Wheen's defense of Marxism has got to be one of the silliest apologias of all time. Perhaps sensing that he has ventured onto thin ice, he abruptly shifts ground. Taking Edmund Wilson's suggestion that Marx was ''the greatest ironist since Swift,'' he insists -- all too literally -- that ''Das Kapital'' should be judged not as an economics treatise but as ''a work of the imagination: a Victorian melodrama, or a vast Gothic novel.'' This specious ploy may explain why there are more Marxists today in English departments than in economics, history or philosophy departments, but it doesn't begin to explain why the rest of us should bother with Marx's ideas now that the Berlin Wall has fallen.</p>
        <p>Never mind. Wheen's embarrassing misconstruction of Marx the thinker occupies a scant dozen pages, and his evocation of the final decade of the life is unexpectedly poignant. By the time Marx achieved fame and financial security -- his relatives were passing on -- his appetite for creative work had begun to fail. His hopes of revolution faded (''Drat the British!'' he complained). And so did his once impatient longing for the Communist millennium.</p>
        <p>Devastated by the deaths of Jenny and his daughter Laura, his health failing from years of hard drinking and chain-smoking, he made a last journey in 1882, to Algiers. There, he had his whiskers shorn, though not before getting himself photographed in all his hirsute splendor one last time. He died a year later, not on the ramparts but in the armchair of his study in London, surrounded by messy, ash-strewn piles of paper, and with a daguerreotype of his father tucked into his breast pocket.</p>
