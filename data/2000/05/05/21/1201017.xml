        <p>1. Despite the fact that the artist Peter Dayton doesn't garden, and his wife, Barbara, paints dogs (a) while the Daytons are currently pet-less, it seems almost everyone else is thinking soft, green and fuzzy these days. Everybody into the compost heap! Gardening is the rage from hipsters to Hapsburgs, grandmothers to grandchildren. Case in point: ''Tiny Green Thumbs,'' a children's gardening primer (b) written by the gardening columnist C.Z. Guest -- the ''green-fingered queen,'' as Bruce Weber once described her -- for her grandsons. When young Gregory, Winston and Ivor visit at Templeton, Guest's house in Old Westbury, playtime is back to the earth. ''Oh, my God, they're such marvelous gardeners,'' Guest exclaims. ''They inspired the book.''</p>
        <p>2. The fashion crowd is thinking green, too. Hussein Chalayan's handmade tulle topiary dress (a) from his spring 2000 collection might be just the thing for mowing the lawn or feeding the chickens (011-44-171-240-5224) . Concerned about the domestication of the forest, the artist Pat Pickett ''personifies'' branches (b) in fashionable Geoffrey Beene-looking clothes. Pickett's work is included in ''Personal Space,'' an exhibition through June 4 at the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton.</p>
        <p>3. Think Wallpaper meets Country Life. From England comes the first groovy gardening magazine, Neweden. Why not? ''Gardening is the new sex,'' says the New York Observer columnist Simon Doonan.</p>
        <p>4. And it's good for you. According to some estimates, gardening burns 300 to 400 calories an hour. According to Lori Turner, a University of Arkansas researcher, gardening helps prevent osteroporosis in women. But gardening can also break your heart. If a plant dies!? Usually overwatering is the problem. To the rescue comes Wormie the Water Sensor. Put Wormie in the soil, and if the soil is moist, his bottom half will darken. When Wormie dries out, his color lightens, and it's time to give him a drink. Flat water, not gin fizz.</p>
        <p>5. Of course, you can always call a professional gardener. Among the new breed on the scene in the New York-Long Island axis is Tom Janczur, whose company, Soil, based in East Hampton, caters to the green needs of clients like Patrick McCarthy, the Fairchild Publications editorial director, and the interior designer Richard Keith Langham.I'm especially drawn to the New American Garden,'' says Janczur. ''It's simple in appearance, with strong sweeps of plant material. Structure and planning are essential.''</p>
        <p>6. The lighter side of the gardening craze is evident in ''Saving Grace,'' a new film starring Brenda Blethyn, which opens Aug. 4. Blethyn, who was nominated for Oscars for 'Secrets and Lies'' and ''Little Voice,'' plays a recently widowed gardener on the brink of financial ruin. She stops growing orchids on her idyllic Cornwall estate and starts growing marijuana with calamitous results.</p>
        <p>7. This just in: According to Garden Design magazine, a French activist group, Le Front de Liberation des Nains de Jardin (the Liberation Front for Garden Gnomes) has been coursing the countryside stealing gnomes from lawns to free France from ''bad taste.'' A similiar group has sprung up in Germany. Indeed, gnomes are very non-U., as Nancy Mitford would say. England's Chelsea Flower Show bans them, but that hasn't stopped Philippe Starck from designing them. Starck's are included in an exhibition of gnomes dating from the Renaissance to the present, on view in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris until July 23.</p>
