        <p>SOME say appearance is everything. How painstakingly the job of grooming is done determines the look and feel of the public places and hallowed spaces of summer, but also, more subtly, the quality of memories they make.</p>
        <p>Here is how the challenge is met on Long Island, and how a great chorus of lawn-cutting, power-washing, pool-scraping, and beach-contouring rises to an annual late spring crescendo, driven by a panicked rush to finish before the weather warms and the crowds are at the gate.</p>
        <p>JONES BEACH</p>
        <p>At four feet high, the flimsy-looking  fences strung along one and a half miles of oceanfront at Jones Beach State Park hardly seem adequate to hold in place some of the most popular and heavily used public beaches in the country.</p>
        <p>But Joseph F. Lescinski, the director of waterfront parks for New York State Parks on Long Island, who is in charge of preparing Jones Beach for the summer, said the beaches would be lost without them.</p>
        <p>''It's difficult to overstate the significance of that fencing,'' Mr. Lescinski said. ''Without it, Jones Beach would literally blow away in the winter. We would be trucking sand in.''</p>
        <p>Held up by stakes hand-driven at intervals of 10 feet. The fences, called, not surprisingly, sand fences at Jones Beach, are partly submerged in the wind-blown sand they trap during the winter.</p>
        <p>Now, in a month-and-a-half-long spurt of labor leading up to the Memorial Day season opener, the hills are disassembled a payloader scoop at a time and the sand spread out on foreshortened and flattened beaches that Mr. Lescinski said were ''radically altered'' by winter.</p>
        <p>It is a mechanized chore for bulldozers and bucket loaders, and one that must be done, Mr. Lescinski knows, before the beaches are besieged by the first of the more than five million bathers Jones Beach attracts each season.</p>
        <p>In an annual undoing of winter's work, the bucket loaders carry the sand from the fence line to beach areas nearer the surf. There, bulldozers contour it in sweeps and swirls into the kind of high, humped, generously proportioned summer beach the public expects, and perhaps assume is just naturally waiting for beach blankets.</p>
        <p>But first the fences must be removed from the sand, section by section. Chains strapped to the bucket loaders carefully pull up the stakes and raise the fences free.</p>
        <p>Once the sand is removed, crews reinstall the fencing using a hand-held tubelike device with a three-inch diameter. The tube, 18  inches long and sealed at one end, slips over the stakes. Workers grip handles on the device and ram the stakes into the sand.</p>
        <p>Crews deploy 2,500 garbage receptacles along beaches and boardwalks at the six-mile-long park. The park's 50 lifeguard towers are set out, all freshly painted to Mr. Lescinski's exacting standards.</p>
        <p>''They need to be sparkling white before they can go out on the sand,'' he said. About 240 life guards, more than 200 of whom are returning from previous summers, will arrive later, the aristocrats of the oceanfront.</p>
        <p>In the maintenance shop, lawn mowers are tuned and ready for preseason trimming on roadway shoulders and at the park's pitch-putt golf course. More than 400 signs must be driven into the sand or set out on pedestals. There is spring painting, another annual chore, at the park's two swimming pool complexes, each with a main pool and a wading pool.</p>
        <p>Nearly 700 people must be hired for seasonal jobs, including maintenance workers, cashiers and short-order cooks.</p>
        <p>With the season breathing down their necks and 300 jobs still begging, parks officials aren't waiting for applicants to come  knocking, Mr. Lescinski said, adding ''We have to go out and contact people in the schools.''</p>
        <p>To attract employees on labor-short Long Island, wages that began at $6.30 an hour last year now top $7, he said.</p>
        <p>THE DUCKS</p>
        <p>Astride his Jacobson Tri-King 1900 D mower, Bill Deacon has been weaving stripes into the Kentucky bluegrass playing field of EAB Park in Central Islip.</p>
        <p>The brand-ew $22 million park is the home of the Long Island Ducks, a minor league team that played its first game on April 28, and Mr. Deacon, the head groundskeeper, wants the grass looking just so.</p>
        <p>''It's probably the first thing people notice,'' said Mr. Deacon, 27, who studied turf management at Pennsylvania State University. ''I decided that a simple, classic baseball pattern would be good.''</p>
        <p>While off-field workers were power-washing, dusting and sweeping, or bolting in the last of the park's green plastic seats, Mr. Deacon was spending hour after hour on the mower, adding the visual effect that gives a baseball diamond a distinctly professional appearance.</p>
        <p>To achieve the effect, Mr. Deacon first cuts a swath riding the mower from home plate to center field. He cuts the next swath going from center to home, and so on, until the field is wearing deep green stripes.</p>
        <p>''When you roll the grass one way it looks light, and when you roll the other way it looks dark,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mowing the 90,000-square-foot field takes two and a half to four hours, depending on how careful Mr. Deacon wants to be. It is a daily chore when the team is in town. ''When they're away, sometimes I may skip a day here and there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Other tricks of field grooming are less apparent. Mr. Deacon tells his crew members never to walk off the front of the pitcher's mound. ''I stress to the guys that's where the pitcher, the catcher and everyone else walks, so they should walk off the sides, just if they have clay on their feet or anything like that.''</p>
        <p>The red clay, like the sod an import from New Jersey, is bad for the grass, Mr. Deacon said.</p>
        <p>His job is in some ways disheartening. Since the season opener, players in spikes have been tearing up the field day after day. On the pitcher's mound -- the field's crown jewel of raised, heavy-duty clay, top-dressed with the lighter red clay used in the infield -- pitchers paw and dig with their spikes like dogs after bones, leaving holes in front of the pitching rubber.</p>
        <p>Batters digging in around home plate also leave their mark, and the mascot, Quackerjack, has been cavorting in huge, web-footed green sneakers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deacon and his game crew of two part-timers fill in the pockmarks after each game and do what they can to repair slashes in the infield and outfield grass.</p>
        <p>Before each game, they chalk the first and third base lines from home to the yellow foul posts 325 feet away in left and right field. And they sweep the infield smooth, leaving no pebbles that might make a ground ball take a bad hop.</p>
        <p>There are discerning critics. The day before the opener, as the Ducks took the field for practice, Bud Harrelson, the manager and a former Mets shortstop, plucked pebbles from between first and second and tossed them away.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deacon, who is from Vancouver, British Columbia, said he would use a system called integrated pest management to keep the field green. ''I don't spray unless I really have to,'' he said. ''But I'm out there all the time looking for diseases.''</p>
        <p>He hopes to keep the tarpaulin off the grass as much as possible, because in  muggy weather it creates conditions for grass-destroying fungi.</p>
        <p>Still, when the rains fall during games, Mr. Deacon and his crew of interns and office workers will pull the tarp across the infield. The field will also be covered when it  rains before games.</p>
        <p>''You can play with brown grass, but you can't play with water-soaked dirt,'' Mr. Deacon said. ''So if you have to tarp, you have to tarp.''</p>
        <p>SPLISH SPLASH</p>
        <p>Around Splish Splash in Riverhead, they call Landress Henderson ''the tube man'' for the five preseason months he puts in patching up and generally sprucing up large rubber tubes.</p>
        <p>The tubes, thousands of them, must be in tip-top shape. They will be floating the paying customers down the Lazy River and a lot of other rides when the water theme park, which rises Oz-like from the eastern terminus of the Long Island Expressway, opens on the Memorial Day weekend.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henderson has since moved on to other jobs. There are so many here.</p>
        <p>The leaves must be swept from the fiberglass water slides of the Giant Twister, the Splash Landing, the Barrier Reef and the perilous-looking Cliff Diver, where riders lie flat on their backs for a nearly vertical fall.</p>
        <p>Then the slides on these and other rides must be power-washed clean of the gunky residue. The adult and kiddie pools need scraping and painting. The Lazy River, where there is no river during spring cleaning, must be caulked so the 250,000 gallons of water pumped in by opening day won't leak.</p>
        <p>A third of everything in the park is painted every year. More than 1,000 beach chairs must be set up in sand that has been swept clean, and every walkway must be scrubbed.</p>
        <p>''By the time we open, everything will be spic and span,'' said Mr. Henderson optimistically.</p>
        <p>With so much to do, special machines are at a premium. Jerry Pangandoyon operates one of the largest, the EZ Industrial 875E Pressure Water Cart, a motorized cart with a ground-level nozzle system to blast the dirt from the walkways and a super-strength power washer attachment for everything else.</p>
        <p>''We probably have the biggest collection of pressure washers in the tri-state area,'' said Chip Cleary, the president of Splish Splash who presides over a time of year at the park that reads like a book. ''The title is, 'Get It Done,' '' he said. ''Make it happen.''</p>
        <p>It's always a rush job. ''There's a very narrow time from when the weather breaks until people come, and about eight acres of pool floors that have to be washed,'' he said. ''Then there are safety inspections, and making the whole park look nice. It's quite an undertaking.''</p>
        <p>As the tempo picks up, the payroll swells. A wintertime crew of 16, augmented by outside contractors, will increase to nearly 700, as seasonal employees, mostly high school and college students, run the rides and food concessions.</p>
        <p>During an average season, Mr. Cleary said, 400,000 people will visit Splish Splash, which he said was the largest water theme park in the New York area.</p>
        <p>By Labor Day, he said, they will have consumed 45,000 gallons of soda, 70,000 feet of hot dogs, 200,000 chicken fingers and three tons of french fries.</p>
        <p>SAGAMORE HILL</p>
        <p>A grooming and landscaping program that promotes tall grass and strives for historic accuracy has taken root at Sagamore Hill in Cove Neck, the national historic site that commemorates Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president, and preserves the 23-room, animal-trophy-filled Roosevelt family mansion.</p>
        <p>Roosevelt purchased the Sagamore Hill property in 1880 and the house was completed in 1885. He lived there on and off until his death in 1919. Sagamore Hill was the summer White House from 1902 to 1908, and remained the home of Roosevelt's second wife, Edith, until her death in 1948.</p>
        <p>A national historic site since 1963, when the National Park Service acquired it from the Theodore Roosevelt Association, the 83 acres around the house had taken on a closely manicured, visitor-oriented, institutional look.</p>
        <p>The grooming strayed from the sometimes shaggy appearance of Sagamore Hill when it was a working farm, where T.R. planted many trees, but axed others for water views.</p>
        <p>In 1995, a cultural landscape report by the Olmstead Center for Landscape Preservation in Brookline, Mass., offered a detailed comparison of the historic landscape and the then-current landscape so park managers could find the way back to the way things were.</p>
        <p>Cuttings were taken from beeches and other trees planted by Roosevelt before the dying parent trees were felled. Then, in March, the site curator, Amy Verone, said that saplings propagated from the cuttings were replanted about 10 feet from the original trees.</p>
        <p>''Our goal is to continue to propagate the type of trees that were here, whenever possible using direct descendants of the historic trees,'' Ms. Verone said. Some trees from the Roosevelt era, including a giant copper beech near the house, are still in excellent health and have decades of life left, she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Verone said that a photograph showing the Roosevelt children playing in tall grass and daisies near the mansion led to a replanting of daisies in the same location last year. The lawn has been allowed to grow six to eight inches tall in the vicinity.</p>
        <p>''Our tractor operator hates that,'' Ms. Verone said. ''He believes the lawn should look like a putting green, but we say no, we want it to look messy. The manicured look is exactly what we are trying to avoid.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Verone said that historical information showed that during the T.R. years, lawn care diminished with distance from the mansion. ''The area immediately around the house was pretty well managed,'' she said. ''Beyond that, it was basically given a little freedom, and we want to give our grass a little freedom too.''</p>
        <p>But last year, dry weather stunted the freshly planted daisies, and parts of the lawn became a bit ratty. ''It looked pretty rough there for a while and people were giving us a hard time about it,'' said Michael B. Shaver, a park ranger.</p>
        <p>''It's funny that people will spend a good amount of money trying to make their yards look good, but it's kind of hard when you are trying to make things look rustic,'' he said.</p>
        <p>About 100,000 people visit each year, Mr. Shaver said. Attendance is highest during the summer season.</p>
        <p>Craftsmen are restoring parts of the porch T.R. used as a platform for orations to crowds that gathered on the lawn during political campaigns and on special occasions.</p>
        <p>Inside the house, curators have dusted off banisters and furniture, and a project to restore Roosevelt's aging, brittle animal trophies was recently completed. Mr. Shaver said there were 81 animal trophies in the house, if ''the 12 steers that went into the construction of one chair'' were included.</p>
        <p>He said everything was more or less as T.R. left it, with some exceptions.</p>
        <p>''He kept an ax by the front door, and any time the newsreel cameramen came he would go stomping off into the woods and chop down a tree for the camera,'' Mr. Shaver said. ''We used to keep the ax there, but in these days of interesting things happening, we keep it tucked away.''</p>
