        <p>William Kennedy, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author, has offered his writings in homage. Jenny Holzer, the multimedia artist whose work is displayed at the Museum of Modern Art, has graced the walls with her scrolls of text.</p>
        <p>And lesser-known writers, painters, sculptors and dancers have made the pilgrimage here by the hundreds to seek inspiration, or at least, to find solace among many others with talent and ambition.</p>
        <p>The Arts Center of the Capital Region, a new mecca for the arts, is increasingly drawing artists, creative types and civic leaders to Troy, of all places.</p>
        <p>A rough-hewn city northeast of Albany along the Hudson River, Troy was once known for mass-producing men's shirts, kitchen stoves and horseshoes.</p>
        <p>But the core of this intractably industrial city has shifted to a $5 million downtown arts center that opened in January with highbrow exhibitions, hands-on classes and plans for experimental shows in a 110-seat theater. The possibilities alone have been a revelation to natives as well as to out-of-towners.</p>
        <p>''I'm amazed,'' said Theresa Testo, 58, a lifelong Troy resident who bought furniture in the warehouse that now holds the arts center's main building. ''It's bringing culture to people who have been starved for it for a very long time.''</p>
        <p>The nonprofit arts center evolved from a local council that was formed in 1962 by artists and civic leaders. Today, it has a $1.2 million annual operating budget and offers classes in jewelry making, sculpture and essay writing for up to 2,000 people a year.</p>
        <p>It also brings artists and arts programs to 45 public schools and organizes after-school and summer activities at the center. ''Here, you make stuff, you get your hands dirty,'' said Frank Pitts, an architect who is the chairman of the center. ''What's happening in this community is that ordinary folks are coming to understand that the arts have a place in our lives, just like exercise, and that it's good for us.''</p>
        <p>The new arts center was carved out of six brick-and-glass warehouses and outfitted with high-tech trappings, like a $50,000 dance floor built over air pockets to lessen the impact of high jumps, and four computer-controlled kilns that set the optimum temperature for baking pottery. The Senator Joseph L. Bruno Theater has rows of seats that collapse, accordionlike, to make way for large productions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, who is from Brunswick, near Troy, led the fund-raising efforts to build the center by securing $1.9 million in state money. The rest came from class and activity fees, corporate sponsorships, donations and government grants. ''The intent was that this would be the center of rejuvenation and renaissance in Troy,'' Senator Bruno said. ''And it has worked out that way.''</p>
        <p>Now, dedicated artists, as well as those with just a creative hankering, drive from 50 miles away for the chance to nurture their talents. On its opening day, the center planned to welcome 500 visitors. Center workers counted 5,000.</p>
        <p>''Every half-hour, 500 more would pour in,'' said Amy Williams, the art center's vice president.</p>
        <p>The writing classes have imbued Kate Uraneck with the confidence to leave her job as an emergency-room doctor to pursue a master's in journalism at Columbia University. ''It's one of those rare experiences,'' said Ms. Uraneck, 42, who lives in Bennington, Vt. ''As a novice writer, you feel encouraged to write more, but yet you get critiqued in a way that lets you grow.''</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Kennedy has been moved by the flourishing arts life in Troy -- enough to bare the rough drafts of his novels to the public for the first time in an unusual exhibit on the writing, and rewriting, process. The free exhibit, which runs through June 24, also displays texts from Ms. Holzer.</p>
        <p>''There's a need for this kind of thing here,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''People want it, and they don't even know it until they have it.''</p>
        <p>As several aspiring writers huddled ever closer to Mr. Kennedy, he explained how he rewrote his novel about Legs Diamond eight times before it was published in 1975. They scoured the yellowed typed pages -- covered with red and blue cross-outs and notes in the margin -- and peppered him with questions.</p>
        <p>Did he read his writing aloud?</p>
        <p>No, he could hear the words in his head.</p>
        <p>Did he use a word-processing program now?</p>
        <p>Yes, but he still printed out everything and edited by hand.</p>
        <p>What color pens did he use for editing?</p>
        <p>Orange, yellow, purple and anything else that was handy.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Ron Weishaar said he took comfort in Mr. Kennedy's mistakes. Writing on nights and weekends, Mr. Weishaar, 48, a medical researcher in nearby Clifton Park, has finished one mystery novel and started another. ''I love the fact that he's rewritten 'Legs' eight times,'' he said. ''I think a couple more times, I should be there.''</p>
