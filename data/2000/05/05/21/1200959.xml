        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Michael Ravitch's review of Kathleen Jones's book ''A Passionate Sisterhood'' (April 30) contains several errors. William Wordsworth and Mary Hutchinson were married in 1802, not 1805. The Regency dates from Feb. 5, 1811, by which time most of the Wordsworths' poet-friends had left the Lake District; Ravitch's description of this group as ''Regency hippies'' is problematic. Most important -- though admittedly an error of interpretation rather than of fact -- Ravitch seems to accept Jones's assertion that Wordsworth's marriage was ''virtually the end'' of Dorothy Wordsworth's life as a writer. Twenty-seven poems, the narratives of ''George &amp; Sarah Green'' and of ''Mary Jones and Her Pet-Lamb,'' and six travel journals suggest otherwise. Dorothy wrote all these works after 1802.</p>
