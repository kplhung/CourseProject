        <p>A STRONG economy and a strong office market are pushing forward plans for the final component of the 120-acre Bridgewater Commons mixed-used center here, 16 years after the project was first announced.</p>
        <p>The Hines Interests Limited Partnership, an international real estate firm based in Houston, is buying the last 20 acres at the site and plans to build 600,000 square feet of office space. The first of two eight-story  buildings is to get under way this fall.</p>
        <p>A 347-room Marriott hotel is now under construction at Bridgewater Commons, the 900,000-square-foot shopping mall that opened in 1988. The mall is close to Interstates 287 and 78 as well as Routes 202-206 and 22, at the heart of this 32-square mile Somerset County township.</p>
        <p>The mall's owner, the Rouse Company, the real estate investment trust in Columbia, Md., plans to expand it in phases by as much as 750,000 square feet. Rouse bought  Bridgewater Commons 18 months ago from TrizecHahn Centers, the retailing division of the TrizecHahn Corporation of Toronto, and its partner, the Prudential Realty Group, the real estate arm of the Newark-based insurer.</p>
        <p>At the time of Rouse's purchase, Marriott was already on board to build the hotel, which will be completed in 18 months, according to Jeff Spilman, a vice president for hotel development at Marriott. But the office component was still to be decided.</p>
        <p>Plans for office space were part of Bridgewater Commons when it was first envisioned in 1984. But those plans were modified in 1997 to expand the mall and to rearrange the size and mix of the hotel and office space under a new agreement between the township and TrizecHahn and Prudential. The new plans still called for a full-service hotel, but they reserved space for the mall to grow. The plans also gave the owners flexibility: they could reduce the office space to 300,000 square feet, or they  could replace it with an all-suite hotel or with 160,000 square feet of retail space.</p>
        <p>Michael Sarkissian, Bridgewater's planning director, said that the center is proceeding along the lines of the original plan,  except that the mall has been expanded.  ''The township is developing as envisioned by its master plan,'' he said. What was envisioned, said William Lanigan, the lawyer for the township who was its mayor in 1961 when the Bridgewater Commons site was rezoned for a regional shopping center, ''was a multiuse facility that would serve as a town center for Bridgewater.''</p>
        <p>The site for the new offices is across Commons Way from the mall and next to  the 8.5 acres where the hotel is rising. Robert Byrne, a vice president of Rouse, said while his company builds office space, it generally does so where it has set up one of its development groups, which is not the case in New Jersey. ''It was logical for us not to build the office space, but rather to sell the land,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Enter the Hines limited partnership. The privately owned company outbid several other developers for the Bridgewater Commons site, buying it for $14 million.</p>
        <p>Location was a crucial factor. ''It is in an office market that is achieving rents that are high enough to support new construction,'' said Jeff Spiritos, a vice president in Hines's Manhattan office and a manager of the $120 million project, which will be called Bridgewater Crossing. Financing for the project, which still must get final approval from the township's planning board, is coming from the $427 million Hines U.S. Development Fund, in which several pension funds have invested to develop suburban office buildings.</p>
        <p>Michael Pride, another project manager at Hines, said that the fund ''favors suburban core locations that are amenity rich.'' The Bridgewater project fits that description, given its proximity to the mall and the hotel and its access to highways, he said, adding that such access ''provides the greatest catch net for tenants to retain and attract employees.''</p>
        <p>The project will be the first in New Jersey that Hines is building for its own account.  But in the last decade, the partnership has served as the development manager for office projects for a number of corporations. For example, Hines is the development manager for the 1.6-million-square-foot complex Goldman, Sachs is planning on the  Hudson River waterfront in Jersey City.</p>
        <p>Somerset County's office market is rebounding from the surfeit of space that came to market nine months ago, particularly in the submarket in the Interstate 287-78 area where Hines wants to build. ''That was more or less a passing phenomenon,'' said Stephen P. Jenco, the research manager at the Fairfield office of Grubb &amp; Ellis, the national commercial brokerage company. That space is being absorbed as corporations, particularly those in the financial, pharmaceutical and telecommunications industries, expand or consolidate into new quarters, he said.</p>
        <p>For example, the Pharmacia Corporation, formed by the merger of Monsanto  with Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, is leasing a 115,000-square-foot building constructed by Gale &amp; Wentworth, the real estate services company in Florham Park, in partnership with the J. P. Morgan Investment Company of Manhattan. It is one of two similar-sized speculative buildings the partners built at their Somerset Financial Center on Route 206 at Lamington Road in Bedminster.</p>
        <p>Mark Yeager, the president of Gale &amp; Wentworth Commercial, said the partners also expect to announce a lease soon for the 130,000-square-foot speculative building they are developing as the first structure at MountainView, their 169-acre corporate campus at Interstate 78 and Martinsville Road in Bernards Township. Eventually, the campus could accommodate up to 850,000 square feet of space in six buildings.</p>
        <p>''Fundamentals like highway access that made this a strong submarket still exist,'' Mr. Yeager said, ''It can handle new product, in moderation.''</p>
        <p>In Bridgewater, across from Hines's planned office project, the last 65,000 square feet of space at a 250,000-square-foot speculative building at the Somerset Corporate Center has been leased by Siemens Financial Services, which is expanding. The building is the second that SJP Properties of Parsippany has built and leased at its 125-acre campus, where two more buildings, totaling 620,000 square feet, are under construction for Aventis Pharma, formed by the merger of Hoechst Marion Roussel and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.</p>
        <p>LEASING in the I-287-78 market is expected to continue. Douglas A. Gaffney, a vice president in the Chatham office of the Trammell Crow Company, the commercial brokerage, development and management company, said, ''There are six to eight tenants with requirements of over 100,000 square feet looking for space.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spiritos of Hines said the size of the buildings planned at Bridgewater Crossing would be an advantage, given that ''there are not a lot of options for large users since the Aventis lease.''</p>
        <p>Sam Buckley, a director at the Saddle Brook office of Insignia/ESG, the project's leasing agent, described it as ''the only project offering 600,000 square feet of contiguous space.''</p>
        <p>Although some real estate executives expressed concerns about traffic congestion at  Bridgewater Commons, Mr. Spiritos said that $20 million in road improvements were completed before the shopping mall was built and that Hines would widen the portion of Route 22 in front of the office project.</p>
        <p>The buildings at Bridgewater Crossing, designed by the Hillier Group of Princeton, will have an exterior of two shades of reddish granite and will feature floors of 37,500 square feet with 45 feet between columns. The buildings will offer high-tech wiring, including high-speed Internet access and  two sources for telecommunications and electricity. M. Arthur Gensler &amp; Associates' Parsippany office designed the interiors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spiritos said construction of the first 300,000 square foot building would begin once 20 to 25 percent of the space is preleased, probably in October, about the time that final approvals are expected from the township. Rents are projected to be $32 to $33 a square foot a year, which brokers said would be competitive for new buildings in the area.</p>
