        <p>Patricia Dilks lost her opportunity to serve on the Pine Hill School Board by the slimmest of margins -- the width of a new Sacajawea gold dollar. On Tuesday, Ms. Dilks lost a coin toss to Mary Jane Oerhl, an incumbent, for the final seat on the nine-member board in the small Camden County town. Last month, Ms. Dilks and Ms. Oerhl tied with 177 votes for third place; three three-year seats were up in the election. According to the Pine Hill schools superintendent, Don Falato, neither woman wanted a recount, since it might cost them personally several hundred dollars, nor did they want a runoff election, which might have cost taxpayers as much as $3,000. So they settled on the coin flip. Ms. Dilks chose heads. County Superintendent Daniel Mastrobuono flipped. The coin landed on tails, and Ms. Oerhl was back on the board.</p>
