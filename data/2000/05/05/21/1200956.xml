        <p>Prince of</p>
        <p>the Clouds</p>
        <p>By Gianni Riotta.</p>
        <p>Translated by</p>
        <p>Stephen Sartarelli.</p>
        <p>Illustrated by Matteo Pericoli.</p>
        <p>287 pp. New York:</p>

        <p>It'S a curious formula, but it works for Umberto Eco and for Indiana Jones: the rip-roaring romance with a scholarly plot. In a single enterprise, you get esoteric knowledge (like Scipio's tactics at the battle of Zama-Naraggara) and big messages (that battles are won by those who have a strategy for living) as well as romantic cliches (young love across the classes, death in battle). The actual plot is always much the same: the desk rat, who may bear some resemblance to the author, is suddenly in demand to save a significant part of the world. Guns and footnotes are equal weapons.</p>
        <p>Gianni Riotta, a co-editor of the Turin newspaper La Stampa, has taken this formula and made it sing. ''Prince of the Clouds'' has its knowing literary references, its didactic pretensions and some deeply irritating devices at the end, which try to force-feed the reader with a dose of geopolitical significance; but it also has life and substance. In Stephen Sartarelli's elegant translation, it's an entertainment proper for the thinking person.</p>
        <p>Riotta's intellectual is Col. Carlo Terzo: a man who lives and breathes war but has never fought in one. He has spent World War II as a military historian in Rome, obsessed with the notion that there are lessons for life in the battles of the past but very aware that he did not even oppose the Fascists, whom he despises. By 1946, he's in retirement in Sicily with the equivocal, glamorous Russian wife who has so generously chosen to favor him with her affection, and every day is a little death. His wife, who is truly dying of cancer, is determined that he shall live.</p>
        <p>She finds him two students: a boy who is not only a war orphan but a would-be poet and a Communist, and a girl who will one day be a duchess, owner and ruler of the lands the boy would dearly love to liberate. Naturally, the two are in love. Just as naturally, their passions warm the old colonel, and he finds himself leading his first and only battle: a bloody set piece, peasants against landowners, where every tactic comes out of the history books.</p>
        <p>This battle is the heart of Riotta's novel, and it is a tour de force. Drums beat softly in the night, hooded villains prowl the ridge, Carlo and his entourage are under siege. (And, yes, his two young students do lose their virginity on the eve of battle; the rules of this kind of adventure are properly respected.) The talk, meanwhile, between Terzo and his makeshift army is all about tactics at Crecy or Cannae. The intellectual schemes that were dry in the first pages now flower bloodily, as does Riotta's book, a tactics manual turned into a romance.</p>
        <p>Riotta allows himself only occasional postmodern moments, as when Terzo, after shooting someone in the back, pauses to think that a movie audience would certainly have booed him. But that doesn't mean this book doesn't have ghosts. It nods to Lampedusa's masterpiece ''The Leopard,'' with its rebellious peasants and entrenched aristos fighting over much the same Sicilian ground. The great man even makes a cameo appearance, eavesdropping in a cafe.</p>
        <p>This book is set almost a century after Lampedusa's, so there is no longer anything sympathetic about the landlord duchess, who uses hired thugs to keep her world in place. The notion that for things to stay the same, things have to change -- a matter of practical politics in ''The Leopard'' -- has here become much more general and even melodramatic: to survive, as Terzo says the great Chinese strategist Sun Tzu once taught, you must expect to die a little.</p>
        <p>And where Lampedusa's book is a matter of history, being very specifically grounded in a particular period of time and a particular situation (Garibaldi liberating Sicily), Riotta wants to play out in the open with general principles and big ideas about chance and love and war. His knowingness is sometimes irritating, making young love a secondhand notion and stripping poor Terzo of all inconvenient passions, but his saving grace is a willingness to rip and to roar with the best of them.</p>
