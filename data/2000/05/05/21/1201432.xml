        <p>Two hundred meters into his attempt to become the first high school miler in 33 years to break four minutes, Alan Webb knew that it would be a long shot. He had been jostled at the start and forced wide. After half a lap of the track tonight, the pace was too slow for his liking.</p>
        <p>He surged into first place and tried to push the pace alone, but he could never make up the precious few seconds he lost early in the race.</p>

        <p>Two hundred meters into his attempt to become the first high school miler in 33 years to break four minutes, Alan Webb knew that it would be a long shot. He had been jostled at the start and forced wide. After half a lap of the track tonight, the pace was too slow for his liking.</p>
        <p>He surged into first place and tried to push the pace alone, but he could never make up the precious few seconds he lost early in the race.</p>
        <p>He set his personal best with a time of  4 minutes 3.33 seconds at a high school meet at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, but he did not become the fourth American high school miler to break the four-minute barrier.</p>
        <p>''The first 200 was a little slow,'' said Webb, a 17-year-old junior from South Lakes High in Reston, Va., who went through 200 in 31-plus seconds and his first lap in 61 seconds, three seconds slower than planned. ''From there I had time to make up. I got a little bit off my rhythm. I didn't know exactly where I was.''</p>
        <p>He went through the half-mile in 2:02, and entered the bell lap at 3:03. The race was all his, with the fastest schoolboy time in the country this year, but the four-minute barrier remained just beyond his reach.</p>
        <p>Not since Marty Liquori ran 3:59.8 on June 23, 1967, has an American high school student breached four minutes, although Webb could take consolation from lowering his personal best in the open mile more than three seconds from 4:06.94. He had run 4:04:8, converted from a 1,600-meter race, last month.</p>
        <p>''Each time I'm getting closer and closer,'' said Webb, who will next run an open mile on June 17 in Raleigh, N.C., at the national scholastic championships.</p>
        <p>''I know I can do it. I'm ready to go the line and do it another day.''</p>
        <p>The wind had died and the afternoon heat had subsided by the time the mile was run tonight. As the other runners entered the track, though, Webb was hurrying into his uniform. Perhaps his concentration was disturbed. The crowd stood and chanted, ''Webb! Webb!'' but it is one thing to run fast and another to run extraordinarily fast on demand. He seemed a little sluggish, according to his coach, Scott Raczko.</p>
        <p>Only Liquori, Jim Ryun and Tim Danielson have ever broken four minutes among American high schoolers. It seems inevitable that Webb will become the fourth, this year or next, but he must learn to deal with the frustrations of failure as much as the anticipation of success, Ryun said before the race.</p>
        <p>''I can remember the Texas Relays my freshman year in college,'' said Ryun, who attended Kansas. ''It was going to be the first four-minute mile run in Texas. Ryun was coming. It didn't happen. You're struggling with media perception, internal pressures, race pressures, all the things that come with it. You have to handle it well. It will get you down if you're not careful.''</p>
        <p>Before the race, Webb and his top competitor, Ricky Brookshire of Boone, N.C., worked out a plan. Brookshire, who ran 4:07.99 on May 6 and is the fastest high school miler ever in North Carolina, would set the pace on the first lap and Webb would take the second lap.</p>
        <p>At first, Brookshire was not going to enter the race, opting instead for his senior prom. His prom date and his coach, however, convinced him that it was possible to participate in both events. His date, Wendy Phipps, even showed up at the meet in her prom dress, carrying Brookshire's tuxedo for the two-hour ride back to Boone.</p>
        <p>But the race strategy fell apart quickly, and Brookshire had to be content with finishing second in 4:08.41. Bobby Lockhart, a sophomore from Winchester, Va., took third in 4:10.32.</p>
        <p>Webb has several more chances this year in his quest to break Ryun's junior class record of 3:59 and to reach the 3:58.14 he needs to qualify for the Olympic trials in the 1,500 meters.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to run under four minutes, with all the hype,'' Webb said. ''I'm a little disappointed. But I won my race. That's all I can ask for. Records will come later. There will be other races. I'll be back.''</p>
