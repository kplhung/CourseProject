        <p>Johanna Gillen Geier, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Philip H. Geier Jr. of New York, was married yesterday afternoon to Peter Ashby Howard II, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Robert J. Howard of Louisville, Ky. The Rev. Gary Seibert performed the ceremony at the Roman Catholic Church of St. Vincent Ferrer in New York.</p>
        <p>The bride, 31, is an art consultant in New York, advising buyers about prints, and galleries about selling works online. She was until last spring the sales administrator at the Peter Findlay Gallery in New York. She graduated from Boston University.</p>
        <p>The bride's father is the chairman and chief executive of the Interpublic Group of Companies, the advertising and marketing concern in New York. Mr. Geier is also a member of the executive committee of the board of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, an overseer of the Columbia Business School, a trustee of the Whitney Museum of American Art and a director of the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 29, coordinates online sales of furniture and decorative arts for Sotheby's and its Internet unit. He graduated from Colgate University and the American arts course at Sotheby's Institute of Art in New York. His father, who is retired, was an executive vice president for safety compliance at the Perini Corporation, a construction company in Framingham, Mass.</p>
        <p>The couple met in September 1998, when Ms. Geier, was working in Sotheby's real estate sales division. She told co-workers that she was looking for a ''new to the New York area, nonjaded date.'' Mr. Howard, who had just come to study at Sotheby's, said he was looking for ''the perfect New York lady.'' They were introduced by someone they both knew at Sotheby's, and a few months later, Ms. Geier invited Mr. Howard to a party.</p>
