        <p>THE top speed of Amtrak trains running between here and Boston will soon rise to 150 miles an hour, up from 125 m.p.h. now between Washington and New York, and 110 m.p.h. from New York to Boston. The change will create a phenomenon that makes some people uneasy: trains whizzing over grade-level crossings at up to 85 miles an hour, a speed at which it takes about a mile to stop.</p>
        <p>But the railroad, at the behest of the federal government, is installing new computerized safety equipment, on the trains and on the tracks, that officials say will reduce the chance of accidents.</p>
        <p>''Step by step, we are eliminating the opportunity for human error,'' said David J. Carol, Amtrak's vice president for high-speed rail development.</p>
        <p>The chance of a passenger's dying in a  train accident is only about one-tenth that of the occupant of a car, but slightly more dangerous than travel by plane, according to the National Safety Council.</p>
        <p>The first visible phase of the improvements, the Acela Regional trains, began in January, with all-electric service that cuts the trip from Pennsylvania Station in New York to South Station in Boston to about four hours, down from six hours on older trains that have to change to diesel engines in New Haven. The Acela Regional trains, which make two round trips daily, are refurbished Metroliner cars with new engines, and they reach speeds of 125 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>This year, Acela Express trains -- using completely new cars -- will begin the run, and they will reach speeds of 150.</p>
        <p>There are no grade-level crossings on the 297 miles of track from Union Station in Washington to New Haven. There are none in Massachusetts, either, and in November,  in preparation for the faster trains, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation approved the closing of the only grade crossing in that state, raising the allowable speed on that stretch of track from 100 m.p.h. to 120.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, four such crossings are being closed, leaving 11. Three are in or near downtown New London, where trains have crept through at no more than 25 miles an hour. Eight others, in Stonington, Waterford and Mystic, allow faster speeds.</p>
        <p>At those places Amtrak is installing a new system, already in use at School Street in Mystic, that may be a national model. One component is ''quad gates,'' which descend over both sides of the roadway so a driver cannot accomplish an ''S maneuver,'' swinging around into the lane of oncoming traffic and avoiding the gates.</p>
        <p>The other half is a sensor system, with three sensors on each lane, including one between the tracks, to see if there is a vehicle present. If there is, the system alerts the oncoming train, one and a half to two miles away. If the engineer does not begin braking immediately, the system itself will apply the brakes.</p>
        <p>Amtrak is paying to have the system installed on all commuter and freight trains that use the tracks in the area, as well as its own trains. The system is the first to alert locomotive engineers to hazards they cannot see, according to federal officials.</p>
        <p>To give the system time to work and the train time to stop, the gates will come down 90 seconds or so before the train arrives. Connecticut law requires 29 seconds.</p>
        <p>While the environmental impact statement prepared by Amtrak said that electrification of the lines does not increase the risk of grade-level crossing accidents, the increase in the number of trains does. A statistical analysis predicts an accident once every three years, although Amtrak say the number will probably be lower.</p>
        <p>If the system reduces the possibility of human error, people in New London have discovered that it introduces machine error. The gates have sometimes closed for long periods when no train is coming. This is a problem of convenience, not safety, but Amtrak promises to solve it.</p>
        <p>After some spectacular rail accidents in Europe recently, Amtrak executives and federal officials are also stressing that the Acela Express trains are designed with crashes in mind. On impact, they are meant to crumple at the vestibules and preserve the passenger compartments intact.</p>
        <p>The tracks are changing, too. In addition to many miles of new track, the Northeast Corridor will have radio beacons buried underneath, each broadcasting the maximum legal speed in the area. Trains will brake automatically if they exceed the speed limit.</p>
        <p>Among other safety changes, Acela Express trains will not move if a door is open, and doors on the side opposite a platform will not open. Overhead bins are enclosed,  and the passenger compartment is padded, with no sharp edges. And the windshield in the engineer's cab is designed to withstand a 12-pound shot fired at 160 miles an hour.</p>
