        <p>Long before Palm Beach colors  became the shades of the season, Olivier Guigni, a floral artist, as he calls himself, whose clients include the restaurants Daniel and Cafe Boulud, loved lime green.  His arrangements, which start at $350, are known for their leaves as much as for their flowers. His Upper East Side shop is paneled in lime-color enamel, and his wardrobe also has verdant touches. Mr. Guigni said the color reminds him of the citrus hues of his native Provence.</p>

        <p>Long before Palm Beach colors  became the shades of the season, Olivier Guigni, a floral artist, as he calls himself, whose clients include the restaurants Daniel and Cafe Boulud, loved lime green.  His arrangements, which start at $350, are known for their leaves as much as for their flowers. His Upper East Side shop is paneled in lime-color enamel, and his wardrobe also has verdant touches. Mr. Guigni said the color reminds him of the citrus hues of his native Provence.</p>
        <p>''If I don't have green around me, I'm not happy,'' he said, shrugging. ''Next year, when it's not in fashion, I'll still love lime green.''</p>
        <p>Here, Mr. Guigni wears a four-ply lime green cashmere sweater by Lucien Pellat Finet, made for him by the designer, a friend, as a birthday gift. (The sweater can be custom-ordered through Barneys or Jeffrey, 449 West 14th Street, for about $1,600.) Mr. Guigni pairs it with New Balance acid-green sneakers from Paragon (they are no longer available, but for $79.99 you can buy neon-green Alpine Moc sneakers by Merrell at some David Z stores ) and technogabardine pants by Prada ($410) in brown, a color that he prefers to black. ''Black is too easy,'' he said. ''I'm always looking for a challenge, whether it's the way I dress or with flowers.''</p>
