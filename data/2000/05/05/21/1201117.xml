        <p>Close your eyes, and on a bright spring afternoon you can envision the rapidly pounding feet of one the country's greatest track stars coming up the straightaway. As a teenager in the late 1970's, when Willingboro High School was new, Carl Lewis ran sprint after sprint around the very track that now bears his name.</p>
        <p>Even now, the legacy of Mr. Lewis and his championship teammates lingers. Just last weekend, the Willingboro boys track team won the Burlington County Open meet. The sectional and state track meets -- which they regularly win -- are coming up. But you won't hear the pounding feet of boys practicing on their home turf at Carl Lewis Stadium. The track is considered unsafe and has been closed.</p>

        <p>Close your eyes, and on a bright spring afternoon you can envision the rapidly pounding feet of one the country's greatest track stars coming up the straightaway. As a teenager in the late 1970's, when Willingboro High School was new, Carl Lewis ran sprint after sprint around the very track that now bears his name.</p>
        <p>Even now, the legacy of Mr. Lewis and his championship teammates lingers. Just last weekend, the Willingboro boys track team won the Burlington County Open meet. The sectional and state track meets -- which they regularly win -- are coming up. But you won't hear the pounding feet of boys practicing on their home turf at Carl Lewis Stadium. The track is considered unsafe and has been closed.</p>
        <p>''I'm sad that this is happening, but I am in complete agreement that we shouldn't be running on this,'' said the boys' track coach, Gerald Richardson, as he bent down and pointed out a two-inch-wide crack that ran across six lanes. ''I can't let my kids get hurt.''</p>
        <p>For now, there is nothing in the school budget for a new track, which would cost $300,000, or even a good resurfacing, which would run about $90,000. The last school district budget was defeated by residents in April, and it is unlikely that any extra money will be found to repair the track.</p>
        <p>The stadium track stands in stark contrast to the well-manicured football and baseball fields adjacent to it. It is on those  grassy expanses where the boys' team and the girls' track team -- which itself has won eight county championships since 1980 -- sometime practice.</p>
        <p>''I tell the kids that they will see adversity in life and that this is just one of the things that will happen that you can't let get you down,'' said Mr. Richardson.</p>
        <p>Still, it seems clear that he is upset. ''What is a shame is that track may be the town's biggest legacy, and we're risking losing it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Willingboro has a distinctive history. It was founded as a Quaker community in 1682 as Wellingborrow and stayed fairly rural for the next 275 years, its main distinction coming as the summer home of Sir William Franklin, the last Colonial governor of New Jersey and Benjamin Franklin's illegitimate son. By 1950, the population was 852.</p>
        <p>But William Levitt saw a different future for the borough. The builder of huge landmark housing developments in New York and Pennsylvania started to acquire land in the borough and by 1956 owned 90 percent of it. Levitt started building a planned community there soon after, one that the sociologist Herbert J. Gans moved into in 1958 to study the town's dynamics. The result was ''The Levittowners: Ways of Life and Politics in a New Suburban Community,'' (Columbia University Press, $22).</p>
        <p>''I bought house No. 25, so I was there from the beginning,'' Mr. Gans, now a professor of sociology at Columbia, said in an interview last week. ''The farmers sold out and everyone made money. It was not an agricultural hot spot, an azalea growing area, maybe corn, but not much farming. The residents were all white.''</p>
        <p>That changed within a few years, Mrs. Gans said, after the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that communities receiving federal funds were required to integrate.</p>
        <p>''Levitt made quick steps to comply,'' Mr. Gans said. ''He wanted to be remembered for a model community.''</p>
        <p>At first, Mr. Gans said, most of the few dozen blacks to move here were the families of officers at nearby Fort Dix. By 1959, residents changed the name of the borough to Levittown, and by the following year, the population had grown to about 11,000. In 1963, when the population reached about 18,000, the town again voted to change its name, this time to a corruption of the old one -- Willingboro.</p>
        <p>Whatever its name, the town thrived. The next few years brought the first hospital, the first traffic light, a model shopping center, new schools, an industrial park, a golf course.</p>
        <p>By the 1980's, the town fluctuated between 36,000 and 40,000 residents, becoming more heavily populated with middle-class black families like the Lewises. Today it is one of the few predominantly black middle-class towns in the state.</p>
        <p>At a school board meeting this month, residents and administrators alike agreed that a committee should be formed to find a corporate sponsor to help refurbish the track. To that end, some residents have tried to reach Mr. Lewis, who after graduation went on to win nine Olympic gold medals in sprints and the long jump.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Lewis now lives in Houston, the stadium was named in his honor in 1984. On the football scoreboard looking down on the vacant track is a small logo -- a swoosh -- the trademark of Nike, Mr. Lewis's athletic shoe sponsor.</p>
        <p>The athletic director at Willingboro High School, David Riley, said the administration has not talked to Mr. Lewis, but Nike is among the companies they have contacted to help out.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview last week, a spokesman for Nike's track program said the company might well interested in helping out the school.</p>
        <p>For their part, supporters of the track team said they would be happy to change the Nike logo for any other if a company would ante up and help rebuild the track.</p>
        <p>''All I can say is people are looking into it,' said Mr. Richardson, who teaches special education at nearby Lenape High School. He was an assistant track coach at Willingboro from 1993 until 1998, when he was promoted to head coach. ''This is an interesting town with lots of pride. The track team is definitely part of that.''</p>
        <p>At some point, the long cracks that snake through the asphalt track were shored up with tar. But the sun and heat make that tar gummy, and on a really warm spring day you can push your finger down at least a half-inch into it.</p>
        <p>''You can imagine what that would be like if a kid got his spike stuck in that,'' said Mr. Richardson. ''That's asking for injury.''</p>
        <p>So while the track sits vacant, the athletes practice on the nearby grass and in the carpeted halls of the school.</p>
        <p>''I can't say that's optimum, but we get by,'' said Mr. Richardson. ''This year, I've seen more taped shins and ankles than ever before. You can't have young kids pounding and pounding and getting shin splints. So we have to rest more. It's a difficult thing right now.''</p>
        <p>While the many of the school's athletic teams have been successful, none have matched the track teams. The boys' team has won nine state championships since the 1979, the year Carl Lewis won the Group 4 title. He still holds the South Jersey long jump record with a 26-foot, 6-inch jump in 1979; Willingboro athletes also hold South Jersey records in the 800-meter run and four different relay events.</p>
        <p>Despite its lack of proper practice fields and tracks, Willingboro is undefeated this season, going into the sectional championships next week and the state meet after that. Mr. Richardson is hopeful on many counts.</p>
        <p>''I think the people now know how important the track team has been in the community,'' he said. ''I have sixth graders looking through the fences. They know about Carl Lewis and they know how long this has been a good thing in the community. It has brought us together in good and bad times.</p>
        <p>''Companies spend money on so many things,'' he observed. ''I just hope we'll find one to invest in a positive thing for kids.''</p>
