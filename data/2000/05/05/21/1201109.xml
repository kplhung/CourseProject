        <p>THE summer rains at Caramoor chase picnickers from the grass and drum the music tents with a staccato beat. Thunder adds its bass line to bird song, while the wind sighs gently in the evergreens. Stormy or clear, the elements here tell a timeless story of leisurely pleasures, where nothing can dampen the spirits for long. No wonder, then, that the place is bustling with volunteers.</p>
        <p>They serve as House Museum docents, as ushers in the outdoor Venetian Theater and Spanish Courtyard where the International Music Festival takes place and as helpers around the lush grounds and gardens.</p>
        <p>They say theirs is no ordinary job, but a chance to learn while soaking up the charm of the 100-acre former estate of Walter and Lucie Rosen. Some admit to fascination with a couple who imported whole rooms from Europe -- not just the furniture, but the walls and ceilings, whose taste extended all over the map and whose pocketbook followed suit.</p>
        <p>Jay Kaufman, a docent in charge of training new docents at the House Museum, said enthusiasm about the Rosens and their collection is as important to being a tour guide as knowledge about art.</p>
        <p>On a chilly day last month, when the rains evoked November but the flowering cherry, dogwood and magnolia trees spoke of spring, a group of five docents-in-training followed Mr. Kaufman around the house. All had attended a volunteer fair here the previous week; all said they were enchanted with the place.</p>
        <p>This was their initial house tour in a process meant to make them not only familiar with the antiques, paintings and statuary in the collection, but also experts in whatever aspects of art history, architecture or the Rosens' social life they chose to explore. Notebooks in hand, they made their way through the narrow corridors, gazing into rooms they would soon know intimately. Mr. Kaufman encouraged them to study on their own, dropping hints to stir their curiosity.</p>
        <p>Stopping at a stained glass window, a copy of Durer's ''St. Jerome in His Study,'' he said: ''There's a whole story connected with this window, but I'm not going to tell you. Do a little research and you'll find out.''</p>
        <p>He did tell them about the fake miniatures on the wall -- ''very valuable, very rare, and forgeries'' -- and dished about the Rosens, whose marriage he described as a love match. (''She was very much in love with him, and he was head over heels in love with her.'') He also offered a bit of photo-analysis, the practice of reading hidden meaning into photographs. ''There are hundreds of pictures of Mrs. Rosen, but always posed, never candid,'' he said, observing that people didn't smile in American portraiture until 1902 and didn't laugh until 1937.</p>
        <p>That kind of detail (gleaned from his voracious reading, he said) captivated Dale Schlein, who said Mr. Kaufman's expertise was the reason she was there. ''He is so mesmerizing, so inspiring,'' she said. ''I wanted to pick his brain.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Schlein, who had retired only weeks before from her job as a bond broker with Chase Securities, said she hoped to spend at least one day a week leading tours. ''I have a little yenta side,'' she said, adding that she wanted to see ''how people of money lived.''</p>
        <p>For one thing, they lived in 50-room houses, or at least the Rosens, whose Mediterranean-style villa was not built as a museum, did. Only 19 of the house's rooms, however, are open to the public, and the bathrooms, of which there are 30, are off limits. ''We don't show them, because they're ordinary,'' Mr. Kaufman said.</p>
        <p>Docents learn both formal and informal rules. Tourists are not permitted to take photographs or eat in the house. Docents are not allowed to be boring.</p>
        <p>''It's a mistake to babble on,'' Mr. Kaufman said. He indicated three terra cotta figures across a room. ''I usually don't mention them,'' he said. ''They're too far away and too small to see.''</p>
        <p>You can fail the docent training course, which demands a reasonable memory for details and some knack as a performer. Whoever does not make the grade, however -- and there were four or five people last year, Mr. Kaufman said -- is encouraged to try again and is steered toward less demanding volunteer work, like helping with visiting school groups.</p>
        <p>Some volunteers play the field, helping wherever they are needed. Emanuela Briccetti brings her enthusiasm for Caramoor to three jobs, as a docent, a helper at the gift shop and a concert usher. ''There's such a peacefulness about the place,'' said Ms. Briccetti, who is retired from her job with the Postal Service. ''It enriches your life, and not only while you're there.''</p>
        <p>The ushers, she said, tend mostly to be retired, well-educated and appreciative of the music. She joined the volunteers for a highbrow reason. ''I'm a James Morris groupie,'' she said, referring to the operatic bass, who sang in a concert here. ''I ushered because of him.''</p>
        <p>Now, however, she is a fan of what Caramoor calls ''Renaissance Days,'' when schoolchildren come for a day of learning and outdoor fun. ''That's the most inspiring thing,'' she said, ''especially the inner city children. These kids are not dumb -- they're enthusiastic, prepared and eager.''</p>
        <p>For David Mainey, a retired software developer for International Business Machines, ushering led to a paid job at the box office.</p>
        <p>Noticing some problems four years ago, he wrote to the management with suggestions and they hired him. Now he both works part time and does volunteer ushering, spending the time, he said, because he likes the music and the excitement of the crowds.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the ushers are older than I am,'' said Mr. Mainey, who is in his 60's. ''They just like to come and hear the music. Perhaps they don't have discretionary money to buy tickets.''</p>
        <p>His wife, Carol, also helps by stuffing envelopes. That makes the Maineys a true Caramoor couple, like many of the Garden Guild volunteers, who run myriad activities ranging from a spring plant sale to a fall antiques show. Betsy Atkins, a volunteer who founded the guild in 1989, said she was amazed by the number of men who wanted to help out -- men who used to own houses with gardens but now live in condominium complexes without them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaufman said people rarely asked what they got in return for volunteering, although docents and guild members can count on free concert tickets.</p>
        <p>''I do it because I enjoy the atmosphere,'' Mr. Mainey said. ''It's a different part of the world than any place else. It's sort of a home.''</p>
        <p>Events and Tours: A Brief Guide</p>
        <p>THE Caramoor International Music Festival begins on June 24 in the Venetian Theater with a concert featuring Yo-Yo Ma and the Orchestra of St. Luke's, conducted by Peter Oundjian, Caramoor's artistic director. Orchestral, jazz and chamber music programs continue through Aug. 12, both in the Venetian Theater and in the more intimate Spanish Courtyard, where a four-voice bel canto recital of works by Brahms, Schubert and others, called ''The Whirl of the Dance,'' will take place June 30. Other highlights include a Mozart marathon on July 9 and two all-day jazz festivals on July 29 and Aug. 5.</p>
        <p>Tours of the House Museum are offered Wednesdays through Sundays from May through October, and by appointment at other times. Afternoon tea is served Thursdays and Fridays at 3 p.m. on a terrace overlooking the Spanish courtyard. Tuesday visitors may eat an al fresco lunch at noon on the terrace and then take a garden tour of the six gardens planted and maintained by the Garden Guild, including one for the visually impaired. Guided garden tours are available by appointment, but visitors are welcome to explore the gardens on their own Wednesdays through Sundays from 1 to 4 p.m.</p>
        <p>Tickets to the summer's events vary from $15 for Thursday afternoon events in the Spanish Courtyard to $75 for the best seats to Andrea Marcovicci's cabaret show on July 1 in the Venetian Theater. ($25 seats are also available for that concert.)</p>
        <p>Caramoor's general information line is 232-5035. For tickets, the number to call is 232-1252. Caramoor's Web site is www.caramoor.com.</p>
