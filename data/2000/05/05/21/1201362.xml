        <p>Flyfishers love clean, fresh water, and they prefer to see it going by them horizontally, sucking at their waders, rather than vertically, in the form of rain. But the customary chagrin any angler feels as rivers begin to swell and turn the color of caramel during a deluge was doubly troubling to me on a recent expedition to the Little Delaware River. I was accompanied by guests, Jim and Lizzie Range, who split their time between a home in Washington, D.C., and a lovely ranch in Craig, Mont. They did not come to the Catskills because they were dying to poke around in musty antique shops, haggling over the price of some old weathervane.</p>
        <p>Besides, their Flyway ranch sits on the banks of one of the world's great trout rivers, the upper Missouri, and I've passed many unforgettable days fishing there. It was payback time, and I felt the pressure as we huddled in our rain jackets, plodding toward the river through orchard grass and timothy flattened by the rain. We were accompanied by Jambo, the Ranges' black Labrador retriever. He, of course, couldn't get wet enough.</p>

        <p>Flyfishers love clean, fresh water, and they prefer to see it going by them horizontally, sucking at their waders, rather than vertically, in the form of rain. But the customary chagrin any angler feels as rivers begin to swell and turn the color of caramel during a deluge was doubly troubling to me on a recent expedition to the Little Delaware River. I was accompanied by guests, Jim and Lizzie Range, who split their time between a home in Washington, D.C., and a lovely ranch in Craig, Mont. They did not come to the Catskills because they were dying to poke around in musty antique shops, haggling over the price of some old weathervane.</p>
        <p>Besides, their Flyway ranch sits on the banks of one of the world's great trout rivers, the upper Missouri, and I've passed many unforgettable days fishing there. It was payback time, and I felt the pressure as we huddled in our rain jackets, plodding toward the river through orchard grass and timothy flattened by the rain. We were accompanied by Jambo, the Ranges' black Labrador retriever. He, of course, couldn't get wet enough.</p>
        <p>Soon, Jim and I were wading in a riffle, as Lizzie hunkered down for a nap in the shelter of a big root ball. Jambo stood up to his belly in the river, staring intently into the backwater at Lizzie's feet, as if he expected a three-pound dog biscuit to materialize at any moment. Never underestimate a dog's capacity for hope.</p>
        <p>I felt a flush of relief a few minutes later when Jim, understanding that in the high water the fish would seek relief from the swift current against the grassy bank, cast right to the bank and promptly hooked a handsome 14-inch brook trout.</p>
        <p>Jim, 54, an insatiable sportsman, lawyer and lobbyist for various conservation groups, is not your typical Beltway insider. He will happily fish  in the rain, and he knows his trout -- and water. He was an architect of a bill recently introduced in Congress that should be of keen interest to advocates of clean water, the Fishable Waters Act of 2000. It would provide financial and technical support for locally based efforts to protect and restore watersheds. The beneficiaries would include watershed coalition groups, which represent partnerships between clean-water activists and state environmental agencies. Such groups are already working independently in places as diverse as New York's Beamoc (Beaverkill and Willowemoc) watershed, Tillamook County in Oregon and on the Licking River watershed in Kentucky. The act would support them more comprehensively, with funds that already exist.</p>
        <p>The act was conceived by the Fishable Waters Coalition, an alliance formed nearly three years ago, partly from brainstorming sessions conducted at Flyway ranch. The goal of this group is to ensure the fulfillment of the promise of a landmark piece of legislation passed 28 years ago, the Clean Water Act. ''The act promised fishable waters, but that hasn't happened yet,'' said Charles Gauvin, president of Trout Unlimited, one member of the coalition, which includes heavyweight organizations as diverse as the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society, the Izaak Walton League of America and the National Corn Growers Association. ''This legislation is a strong step towards protecting and repairing America's troubled waters.''</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, nearly 40 percent of the nation's waters are still not considered fishable. That may sound like an arbitrary line in the sand drawn by self-interested anglers, but it was written into the law. Besides, the ability of a waterway to support fish is a pretty simple and dramatic barometer of its health. And according to the coalition, some sources estimate that barely 2 percent of America's 3.6 million stream miles are healthy enough to be considered high quality.</p>
        <p>''We deserve better than that,'' Jim Range said, ''in a wealthy nation where 80 percent of the population stands squarely behind the concept of fishable waters.''</p>
        <p>The Fishable Waters Act has two noteworthy features. As Range said, ''It's a bottoms-up piece of legislation that emanates from the community up, rather than from the government down.'' Thus, it is free of Big Government regulatory measures that top-down laws often contain and which many people reflexively oppose.</p>
        <p>Congress is expected to conduct hearings on the act as early as this summer, setting the stage for consideration in the 107th Congress. The Fishable Waters Act and the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, which sailed through the House of Representatives recently, with bipartisan support, promising to invest nearly $3 billion each year for the next 15 years in conservation projects, could jointly establish a new baseline for conservation legislation in this century.</p>
        <p>The rain fell, Lizzie slept. Jim fished hard for another 30 minutes in a downpour before reluctantly agreeing to call it quits. Neither the forecast nor the evidence trickling down our necks promised much for the rest of the weekend. But my guests were impassioned, optimistic anglers. The next day we had sunshine, and, despite high, cold water, we experienced a dense caddis hatch on the West Branch of the Delaware. Although the Ranges were fishing unfamiliar waters, they performed heroically, inducing our truculent and wise brown trout to take their Missouri River caddis patterns.</p>
        <p>It was a fine display of angling expertise, not exactly what you expect of a Beltway insider.</p>
