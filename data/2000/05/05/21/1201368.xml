        <p>If Rudolph W. Giuliani quit the mayoralty tomorrow, he would leave behind a city that is safer and more prosperous than it was when he took over City Hall in 1994.</p>
        <p>A solid legacy, but a narrow one, especially since New York City's prosperity is linked closely to the thriving national economy and crime is down all over the Giuliani-less country. And the mayor's image is marred by a reputation for insensitivity, especially racial insensitivity.</p>
        <p>So it makes perfect sense that Mr. Giuliani wants to devote the next year and a half to being ''a better mayor,'' as he said on Friday when he withdrew from the Senate race -- to build on his successes and knock down the barriers he concedes he may have erected between his administration and many minority New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>If revising his legacy is indeed the objective of the newly introspective-sounding mayor, the issues are out there waiting for him. He faces the skepticism of people who have heard similar commitments from him before, only to see them go nowhere. He may also find that he gets less attention than he used to. Nothing collapses as quickly as the prominence of a politician about to lose his platform.</p>
        <p>''Who cares what he says?'' asked H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller and likely candidate for governor in 2002. ''He's a lame duck. He's on his way out. People are going to focus on the Senate race and who is going to be the next mayor. If he'd done this two or three years ago, fine, but he has already put his mark on history.''</p>
        <p>The comptroller recalled the mayor's pledge to reach out to minorities when he was running for re-election in 1997. He did not do so for a year, until Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, was killed by police officers. Then he met with Mr. McCall and others. ''Then I never heard from him again,'' Mr. McCall said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Giuliani still has 19 months in office. His health allowing, he can do a lot even if hampered by skepticism and the dimming of the spotlight. There is everything from the symbolic -- removing all those barricades around City Hall before the next mayor does -- to matters as complex as expanding health insurance coverage, a new Giuliani goal.</p>
        <p>Some issues have been pending a long time. One of the most problematic for this mayor has been improving relations between the Police Department and minority groups in the city, especially in the aftermath of the shooting deaths of Mr. Diallo and Patrick M. Dorismond.</p>
        <p>''I wrote to him last week, said this is the time to drop his opposition to the independent police board,'' said Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker. ''That would be great not only for the future of the city, but would have a strong impact on the city right now.'' Creating an oversight board might also be a way of responding to a recent report by the United States Civil Rights Commission, which accuses the police of racial profiling.</p>
        <p>But the police commissioner, Howard Safir, rebuffed Mr. Vallone last week, and the speaker has yet to hear from the mayor, who is still fighting his idea in court.</p>
        <p>Many other matters are before the mayor now, especially one that always tops the list of issues people care about in public opinion polls: education. The city's contract with the United Federation of Teachers is in negotiations, as are all municipal union contracts. The mayor has focused on a merit pay plan for teachers -- rewarding individual teachers with bonuses tied to higher student test scores. That is anathema to the teachers' union, which considers merit pay divisive and subjective.  Nobody familiar with the powerful teachers' union gives the idea a realistic chance of success.</p>
        <p>''He can say, 'I'd like individual merit pay, but I know it's a nonstarter, so let's come together on a group plan,' '' suggested Mark Green, the public advocate, referring to merit pay for the faculties of entire schools rather than for individual teachers.</p>
        <p>The mayor could also call for reduced class sizes and find the financial resources to make that possible -- dropping his proposal to cut the income tax surcharge and dedicating the income to schools, for instance.</p>
        <p>He has often said he wants to eliminate the Board of Education; so does Mr. Vallone. Both want the school system to be under direct city control. The two could lobby for change in Albany, on schools and on another central issue -- getting the State Legislature to raise New York City's debt limit and allow the city to borrow more. If it cannot, projects like construction of schools are in trouble. ''Now that he no longer has to worry what they think of him in Syracuse and Buffalo, he could do more; he's never been up there with me,'' Mr. Vallone said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said on Friday that he had become more sensitive to the importance of expanding health insurance coverage. That is not exclusively a city issue. But the mayor could channel more city money to the municipal hospitals, the refuge of many poor uninsured New Yorkers. The hospitals have lost a great deal of city financing in the last decade.</p>
        <p>He could mobilize city agencies to encourage more people to enroll in a newly expanded state program for low-income New Yorkers -- Child Health Plus and Family Health Plus. Health care experts estimate that a half-million city residents are eligible but unenrolled.</p>
        <p>As he reconsiders his mayoralty, Mr. Giuliani might look again at his policy requiring single homeless adults to work in exchange for shelter. That was shot down by a State Supreme Court judge, but the decision is now on appeal by the Giuliani administration.</p>
        <p>The city is also still planning to deny shelter to parents who do not comply with city requirements -- participating in workfare, for instance; their children would go into foster care if shelter were denied. That plan is on hold, pending court action, but is still official city policy.</p>
        <p>These approaches have led to broad criticism, and to Leno-Letterman caricatures of a heartless mayor. Mr. Giuliani strongly defended his policies toward the homeless as recently as three nights ago, during a nationally televised town hall meeting. He told his questioner, Andrea Mitchell, that encouraging dependency was cruel, while encouraging independence was humane -- long his approach to welfare and the homeless.</p>
        <p>Other elected officials say they doubt that the mayor's plan to govern differently means that he is prepared to change his ideology. But they say just a change in his public temperament could make a difference. Mr. Green, who has been a target of Mr. Giuliani's disdain, noted, with amazement in his voice, that when he called the mayor after Mr. Giuliani dropped his Senate candidacy, the mayor took his call. ''We said more than 'hello' for the first time in three years,'' Mr. Green said.</p>
        <p>But can a change not in content but tone -- in itself a difficult thing to pull off for so entrenched a personality -- accomplish the mayor's goal of ''reaching everyone in this city''?</p>
        <p>After six and a half years of seeing one kind of mayor, some who work with Mr. Giuliani are openly dubious.</p>
        <p>''If he is sincere and truly wants to reach out, I think the black community has always been open to wanting to work with the mayor,'' said C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president. But there are many skeptics, she added, because the mayor has made similar promises before, and failed to convincingly follow up. He can still keep his own commitment to change, she said. ''But not easily.''</p>
