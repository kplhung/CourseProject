        <p>In Poland, long a trophy of East-West competition and now one of NATO's newest members, the installation of Vladimir Putin as Russia's president has raised new questions about Moscow's intentions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin has signaled a desire to improve relations between the former Warsaw Pact allies, making telephone calls to the Polish president and showing new openness about the killing of Polish officers during World War II by the Soviets at Katyn, Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek said.</p>
        <p>The overtures mark a welcome symbolic change from recent public feuds over Russian spying in Poland and Polish popular support for the Chechens, which caused Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to cancel a visit here in February.</p>
        <p>Despite the signals from Mr. Putin, senior Polish officials say a serious exchange of official visits is unlikely before autumn, and other influential officials, like Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's chief foreign policy adviser, Jerzy Marek Nowakowski, see more difficult times ahead.</p>
        <p>They say that Mr. Putin is likely to increase diplomatic and economic pressure on Ukraine to draw closer to Moscow, putting Poland, which favors a sovereign Ukraine's orientation toward the West, in a more awkward position.</p>
        <p>They say they also expect Mr. Putin, who is trying to show a stronger Russian face abroad and extend Russian influence, to try to block any further expansion of NATO membership, especially to any Baltic nation, something Warsaw also supports. Poland is especially eager to have its neighbors Lithuania and Slovakia in NATO, Mr. Geremek said.</p>
        <p>But some Polish analysts say that a new government is likely to take a softer line toward Moscow in any case, meaning that Mr. Putin has little incentive to put real substance behind his effort at better ties.</p>
        <p>Marek Matraszek, Warsaw director of CEC Government Relations, a political consulting firm, noted that the leftist party's leaders, including President Aleksander Kwasniewski, have spoken about a reconciliation with Russia. Mr. Matraszek said that a new government would be less likely to push a new round of NATO expansion that would include any Baltic states -- still a red line for Moscow, which in Soviet times ruled the three Baltic nations for 50 years, and still feels proprietary about the many ethnic Russians living there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Geremek emphasized that the first year of Poland's membership in NATO had proven ''a force for stability in Europe,'' answering those who thought NATO expansion would destroy the West's relations with Moscow.</p>
        <p>''Russia is trying to press the idea that NATO expansion is creating problems, not solving them,'' Mr. Geremek said. ''But it's not true. NATO expansion has stabilized the region. And our support for post-Communist integration should not destroy the policy of good neighborly relations.'' Given trade, markets and energy interests, he said, both countries ''have the basis for a more normal relationship.''</p>
        <p>It was left to a senior aide to point out that NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia over Kosovo -- which started less than a month after the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians joined NATO last spring -- did more to upset Moscow than NATO expansion.</p>
        <p>The Moscow-Warsaw disputes earlier this year had more to do with Russian domestic politics than any Polish policy, officials said.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Putin maneuvered for the presidency, Moscow found it useful to ''play the Polish card'' in response to NATO and prospective European Union enlargement, officials said, touching the ever-ready anti-Russian nerve here.</p>
        <p>Poland was the one new NATO member that wanted to celebrate its first anniversary of membership and remains fundamentally pro-American and pro-NATO. In the Czech Republic and Hungary, by contrast, the war in Kosovo -- coming so soon after their entry into the alliance -- underscored deep doubts about NATO among significant minorities of the population.</p>
        <p>Grzegorz Kostrzewa-Zorbas, a former government official and a scholar of international relations at the Polish Academy of Sciences, sees Russian policy toward Poland driven almost entirely by the domestic Russian debate over the loss of national pride and status. Kosovo was a pretext, not a central factor, he says. ''The Russians regard us as Slavic traitors and puppets of the West,'' he said. ''That still resonates.''</p>
        <p>The relationship, given the swings of history, has been traumatic for both sides. Poland occupied the Kremlin in the 17th century and defeated the Red Army in 1920, while doing much to destroy Moscow's sway over Eastern Europe. Poles, who like to think of their country as the European cultural center that brought forth Chopin and a strong Catholic Church, remember Russian and then Soviet occupation.</p>
        <p>In January, Poland expelled nine Russian diplomats accused of spying, many of them caught on videotape, officials say, picking up or leaving material at hidden drops. The Russians responded by expelling nine Polish diplomats.</p>
        <p>Then, in February, a demonstration in Poznan against Russian actions in Chechnya turned ugly when protesters broke into the Russian consulate and tore up the Russian flag. The police watched, but did nothing. The Polish government apologized and dismissed some policemen, but Mr. Ivanov canceled his visit.</p>
        <p>But Polish officials say that Mr. Putin now seems to understand that public disputes with Poland can be counterproductive, especially given that Poland remains Moscow's seventh-largest trading partner. At least 100,000 Russians, Belarussians and Ukrainians live and work here. At the same time, officials say, some senior representatives of Russian organized crime have traveled to Poland on diplomatic passports.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nowakowski, a Russian expert, says that timing is important. Mr. Putin became president after Poland entered NATO, so he can start afresh to create ''a more realistic partnership.'' Mr. Putin is also considering attending a ceremony in July when Poland opens a military cemetery for the dead of Katyn, officials say, which would be a gesture highly prized here.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Nowakowski said, Russia is trying to play Polish politics now, paying more attention to President Kwasniewski and the former Communists than to the government, and trying to win support for a second natural gas pipeline through Poland to Western Europe that would bypass Ukraine.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Nowakowski, ''the future of the states between Russia and Poland'' -- Ukraine, Belarus and the Baltic nations -- ''is the most important question for Russian-Polish relations.'' And he sees potential trouble ahead, especially over Ukraine, where Russia could use economic levers and even military pressure to keep Kiev in line.</p>
