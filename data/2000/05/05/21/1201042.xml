        <p>Many first-time visitors to Argenteuil have a sense of deja vu: they recognize parts of the small town on the banks of the Seine northwest of Paris from the many paintings Monet, Manet, Caillebotte, Renoir, Sisley and Boudin made there. More than 50 of those paintings can be seen in ''The Impressionists at Argenteuil,'' the first exhibition to focus on the second most important site, after Paris, in the development of Impressionism. It opens at the National Gallery of Art in Washington on May 28 and travels to Hartford this summer.</p>
        <p>Monet started it all when he moved to Argenteuil for six years in 1871. His Impressionist colleagues would often come to visit. Inspired by the town's rustic charm, they painted its towpaths, railway bridges, gardens, factories, sailboats, regattas, each other and their families. At Monet's house in Argenteuil the group planned what became the first Impressionist exhibition, which took place in 1874.</p>

        <p>Monet started it all when he moved to Argenteuil for six years in 1871. His Impressionist colleagues would often come to visit. Inspired by the town's rustic charm, they painted its towpaths, railway bridges, gardens, factories, sailboats, regattas, each other and their families. At Monet's house in Argenteuil the group planned what became the first Impressionist exhibition, which took place in 1874.</p>
        <p>The painters often worked together, capturing the same scene side by side, and the exhibition includes several pairings: ''Sailboats at Argenteuil'' by Monet and Renoir; Caillebotte's ''Argenteuil Bridge and the Seine'' and Monet's ''Highway Bridge and Boat Basin;'' and a cluster of trees in Boudin's ''Seine at Argenteuil'' and Monet's ''Promenade at Argenteuil.''</p>
        <p>The show remains in Washington until Aug. 20, then moves to the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, Sept. 9 through Dec. 3.</p>
        <p>The National Gallery, on the National Mall between Third and Ninth Streets at Constitution Avenue NW, is open daily. Admission is free. Information: (202) 737-4215 or www.nga.gov.</p>
        <p>The Wadsworth Atheneum, 600 Main Street, is open Tuesday through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Dated and timed tickets, costing $17, are available by calling (877) 600-6246. General information: (860) 278-2670 or www.wadsworthatheneum.org.</p>
