        <p>The new, stricter emissions tests, which had caused waits of up to five hours partly because the machines did not work in cold weather, may also have a problem operating when it is hot. The Department of Environmental Protection gave the system a routine check on May 8 and 9, two unusually warm days. Eight of the 14 gasoline analyzer machines tested failed to give accurate readings, said Jeff Maclin, a spokesman for the department, who said it was not known whether the heat affected the machines. Tests under hot conditions have since been conducted and the machinery operated properly, he said.</p>
