        <p>Ron Villone won his fourth straight start and the Cincinnati Reds, helped when a Cubs pinch-runner held up to see whether Ken Griffey Jr. would make a great catch, beat host Chicago by 5-3 yesterday.</p>
        <p>Villone (6-1), staked to a quick five-run lead, took a shutout into the seventh inning.</p>
        <p>The Cubs then loaded the bases with no outs on three straight singles.</p>
        <p>Ricky Gutierrez followed with a drive to center field off the ivy-covered wall, but it turned into just a long run-scoring single.</p>
        <p>That is because the pinch-runner Julio Zuleta, who was on second base, slowed up to watch whether Griffey would make an over-the-shoulder catch.</p>
        <p>Zuleta only reached third.</p>
        <p>The reliever Scott Williamson replaced Villone and gave up an run-scoring grounder to Dave Martinez and a sacrifice fly to Sammy Sosa that made the score 5-3.</p>
        <p>Glenallen Hill struck out to end the inning.</p>
        <p>CARDINALS 19, PIRATES 4: St. Louis hit three more homers, giving it an league-leading 88, to beat host Pittsburgh in its highest-scoring game since 1977.</p>
        <p>The Cardinals scored seven runs in the eighth, highlighted by Mark McGwire's three-run double, and five more in the ninth off the Pirates utilityman Keith Osik, who yielded a two-run homer to Thomas Howard an inning after hitting a two-run homer himself.</p>
        <p>The Cardinals starter Pat Hentgen (4-4) had lost four in a row and was without a victory in five starts since April 16.</p>
        <p>Francisco Cordova (1-4) came off the disabled list to lose his fourth straight decision.</p>
        <p>DODGERS 12, MARLINS 6: Gary Sheffield hit a grand slam to dead center field against his former team, capping off Los Angeles's victory over host Florida.</p>
        <p>Eric Karros homered and drove in three runs as the Dodgers won their fourth in a row. Shawn Green had a triple, double and single for Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>BREWERS 7, GIANTS 0: Jose Hernandez's grand slam capped a six-run first inning as host Milwaukee sent San Francisco to its eighth straight loss.</p>
        <p>Jeff D'Amico (2-1) made a remarkable return to County Stadium, allowing four hits over seven shutout innings in his first start in Milwaukee since Sept. 27, 1997. After missing all but one inning of the last two seasons with shoulder problems, he has allowed one earned run in three starts this year for an 0.43 ERA.</p>
        <p>EXPOS 8, ASTROS 7: Rondell White tied a team record with three doubles and Peter Bergeron homered as host Montreal held off Houston.</p>
        <p>Hideki Irabu (2-3) allowed six hits and three runs in six innings for his first victory in his last seven starts. Irabu also drove in a run for the first time in his career with a single in the second inning.</p>
        <p>Montreal built an 8-2 lead through five innings before Houston pulled close by scoring four runs off three Expos relievers.</p>
        <p>BRAVES 10, PADRES 6: Keith Lockhart, filling in for the injured Quilvio Veras, homered for the first time in nearly a year and host Atlanta beat San Diego.</p>
        <p>The rookie Rafael Furcal drove in three runs for the Braves, who have won seven of their last eight and have scored 56 runs during that span.</p>
        <p>John Burkett (3-2) picked up the victory despite allowing six runs and 11 hits in six and two-thirds innings. Will Cunnane (1-1) took the loss.</p>
        <p>ROCKIES 4, PHILLIES 3: Kevin Jarvis and four Colorado relievers combined on a two-hitter and Neifi Perez singled home the go-ahead run in the eighth inning to lift the Rockies over host Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Jarvis held the Phillies wihtout a hit until Doug Glanville hit a two-run homer with one out in the sixth, tying it at 2. One out later, Bobby Abreu also homered.  NATIONAL LEAGUE: ROUNDUP</p>
