        <p>Taking a moment's break from a boisterous campaign rally the other day in the colonial city of Cajamarca, President Alberto K. Fujimori pointed to a dark cloud gliding over his head and cried, ''Let there be rain for the farmers!''</p>
        <p>Within moments, the sky poured open, and thousands cheered.</p>
        <p>''Don't worry,'' Mr. Fujimori laughed into his microphone. ''Everything is coordinated.''</p>
        <p>It has often seemed that way over the last 10 years, as Mr. Fujimori effectively confronted an array of plagues -- from hyperinflation to terrorism to an invasion of narcotics traffickers, from war with Ecuador to massive flooding caused by El Nino.</p>
        <p>But only a day after Mr. Fujimori played with the clouds over Cajamarca, he faced a mounting political crisis that will surely challenge his considerable pluck and power. Alejandro Toledo, his opponent in the May 28 runoff presidential election, dropped out of the race on Thursday. Mr. Fujimori was left with an open field for victory and the prospect of a third five-year term, but one in which his legitimacy and credibility would be questioned both here and abroad.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori now faces the possibility of unending protest marches, criticism from Washington and other foreign capitals, and even, perhaps, economic sanctions from the United States Congress and the Organization of American States that could impede his fight against drug trafficking and unemployment.</p>
        <p>The 61-year-old president, who is the son of Japanese immigrants, was able to face down international pressures after he suspended the operations of his own Congress and Supreme Court in 1992 because he had overwhelming popular support. But now Peru is badly split, with university students and labor unions preparing to mount the biggest street protests in more than a generation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori, in effect, has become a victim of his own success. Now that he has virtually defeated the terrorists of the Maoist Shining Path, a growing number of Peruvians are seeking an easing of his authoritarianism. In the last three years, even as the terrorism waned, Mr. Fujimori did not ease his hold on power. He tightened it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori decided he could run for re-election this year even though the Constitution prohibits three consecutive terms. He had three judges dismissed by Congress when they disagreed with his legal interpretation that the constitutional term limit did not cover his first term because it was completed before the Constitution itself. He then established control over several television networks through legal maneuvers, and withdrew Peru from the jurisdiction of a regional human rights court.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori's powers were amply on display in the first round of the presidential race when all television networks, save for one cable channel, virtually boycotted his opposition.</p>
        <p>''He has been manipulating so much that even if he won fairly,  people wouldn't believe it was a fair process,'' said Enrique Zileri, editor of the political magazine Caretas. ''Whatever happens, Fujimori becomes a much weaker president who will be discredited internationally.''</p>
        <p>Hernan Chaparro Melo, a pollster, said, ''With 57 percent of the people continuing to believe the election process is unjust, we are entering difficult times.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fujimori has had his back to the wall before, and he has always shown himself to be a leader of great resourcefulness and impeccable timing.</p>
        <p>Over the last few weeks, Mr. Fujimori suddenly emerged from his early campaign slumber and appeared eager for a fight. He told enthusiastic campaign rallies with growing crowds that he would not accept a postponement of the election even before Mr. Toledo demanded that the vote be put off several weeks to give foreign election observers time to test new computer software installed to count the vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori sharpened his message on television and on the stump, arguing more forcefully that he is the one candidate strong enough to lead this desperately poor and often chaotic country. Taking on his greatest weaknesses, he pledged an all-out attack on unemployment and confronted his foreign critics with diatribes designed to inspire Peruvian nationalism.</p>
        <p>''We don't need foreigners to tell us how to hold elections,'' Mr. Fujimori told a crowd in the city of Trujillo shortly after Mr. Toledo's announcement that he was dropping out of the race if the election was not postponed. ''We're sovereign Peruvians and we have the right to hold our democracy.''</p>
        <p>And after underestimating Mr. Toledo, an American-educated business school professor who rose meteorically in the weeks before the first round vote, Mr. Fujimori finally began taking him on -- calling him a rudderless, indecisive leader who only knows how to turn to Washington, Buenos Aires and European capitals for political direction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori's old magic was amply on display this week as he toured the north of the country. He laughed, danced and gleefully tossed cassettes of his campaign songs to passersby who thrilled at seeing their president.</p>
        <p>As his campaign caravan twisted through the streets of Chiclayo, a local witchdoctor livened the proceedings by cavorting before the president's campaign truck, waving a giant pumpkin and spritzing some alcoholic brew through his teeth and onto the swelling crowds.</p>
        <p>And as a brass band played his campaign theme song, Mr. Fujimori went into a fevered jig on the stump as a throng of more than 10,000 went wild. ''My advisers tell me I shouldn't dance,'' President Fujimori laughed, ''but I can't help myself!'' It was the kind of populist touch that led him to landslide victories in 1990 and 1995.</p>
        <p>Speaking in his heavily accented English for effect, he told the crowd, ''They ask: 'What is happening in Peru?' '' Then answering the question firmly in Spanish, he said, ''We've had a government the last 10 years that has been decisive and has never ducked the tough issues.''</p>
        <p>To crowds that filled the central plaza of Cajamarca, a highland city of magnificent baroque churches, luscious cheeses and lyrical poets where the Incas made their first stand against the Spanish invaders in the 16th century, Mr. Fujimori called on the crowd to cheer loud enough so the Argentine government could hear.</p>
        <p>Donning a tall straw hat popular with the Indian peasants here, he snickered at Mr. Toledo for traveling earlier in the week to Buenos Aires to consult with President Fernando de la Rua and former President Raul Alfonsin.</p>
        <p>Speaking of his opponents, he said: ''If they were really democrats and really trusted the people, they wouldn't complain all the time in Washington and Buenos Aires. They show by going abroad that they don't care about the votes of the Peruvian people.''</p>
        <p>Sharpening the nationalistic argument is Francisco Tudela, a former foreign minister and Mr. Fujimori's vice presidential candidate. ''I think there is a fear, an ideological fear, of a very independent government in Latin America that is outside the establishment,'' Mr. Tudela said in an interview. He added, ''The fact that President Fujimori did not negotiate with terrorist groups irritates some abroad.''</p>
