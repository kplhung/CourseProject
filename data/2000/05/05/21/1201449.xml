        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>As a student at the American University between 1971-1975, and a major basketball fan, I thought that the article by Kermit Washington (''A Sudden, Violent Moment That Still Haunts a Life,'' May 14) was as honest and accurate as they come.</p>
        <p>Many of today's athletes could probably learn a few lessons from Kermit. It is rather unfortunate that one moment, a snapshot in time, has taken such a negative toll on his life and his career.</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>As a student at the American University between 1971-1975, and a major basketball fan, I thought that the article by Kermit Washington (''A Sudden, Violent Moment That Still Haunts a Life,'' May 14) was as honest and accurate as they come.</p>
        <p>Many of today's athletes could probably learn a few lessons from Kermit. It is rather unfortunate that one moment, a snapshot in time, has taken such a negative toll on his life and his career.</p>
        <p>Kermit was an inspiration for many of us at A.U. He was the consummate student-athlete. He was an individual who took pride in his athletic ability, as well as his education. He was never too elusive or arrogant to say hello and discuss things with others. He nicknamed me Elliott Gould, who acted in the movie ''M*A*S*H,'' because of my mustache and Army fatigues.</p>
        <p>As an individual who played intramurals only, I attended all of the home games as well as many of the away games including American University's trip to Madison Square Garden for the National Invitation Tournament in 1973. Kermit always gave 100 percent on and off the court. He was never involved in any antics or problems and was a model player. Even in those days, there were those players who were a bit ''off' like Johnny Lloyd and Lenny Lockhart, but Kermit was always together and a team player.</p>
        <p>When I lived in Atlanta in the late 70's and obtained seats behind the Portland bench, he turned around during a timeout and said, ''Elliott!'' It brought a huge smile to my face to know that even though he was in the N.B.A., he remembered me.</p>
        <p>I may seem a bit biased here. The truth is, that if his punch would have landed somewhere else, or if Rudy Tomjanovich had not been so severely hurt, Kermit would have gone on to a wonderful career, not only in the N.B.A., but in society as well, in that he is a major contributor to his community.</p>
        <p>I am glad to see that Kermit was able to tell his story, and as a fellow student at A.U., I feel the need to validate and confirm its accuracy.</p>
