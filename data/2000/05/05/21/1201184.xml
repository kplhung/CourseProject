        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The brief article about on performance-based grants to colleges and universities in the May 7 issue doesn't quite make the grade. It notes that Rutgers University and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey got the highest ratings when it came to receiving money from the new performance fund of New Jersey's Commission on Higher Education. Actually, six state public colleges and universities (Montclair State University, U.M.D.N.J., Rutgers, Kean University, the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey and Thomas Edison State College) met or exceeded the state's expectations in every category, and received 100 percent of the money set aside for them. While Rutgers and U.M.D.N.J. got bigger slices of the fiscal pie, it is only because they are bigger institutions. Since Montclair State University received a perfect score based on how well we performed in several very important categories, including graduation rates, transfer rates and efficiency, we want to make sure that our accomplishments are duly noted.</p>
