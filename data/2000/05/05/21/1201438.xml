        <p>The MetroStars blocked out a dreadful first half tonight and then shocked Tampa Bay in overtime when Petter Villegas rocketed a 25-yard shot past a stunned Mutiny defense and goalkeeper Scott Garlick for a 3-2 victory.</p>
        <p>After allowing a 2-0 Tampa Bay lead, the MetroStars limped back into the match with two goals in the second half. At the start of the second overtime, Clint Mathis, the club's new acquisition from Los Angeles, slipped a pass from the left to Mark Chung, a late substitute, at the top of the penalty area. Chung rolled a pass back to Villegas, who first-timed the ball.</p>
        <p>''Mark Chung's entrance into the game made a big difference,'' MetroStars Coach Octavio Zambrano said. ''He gave us more ball possession and better options. Tampa Bay couldn't key on Tab Ramos or Clint Mathis.''</p>
        <p>The MetroStars (4-6, 12 points) got their first look at Tampa Bay's goal-scoring sensation, Mamadou Diallo, tonight at Giants Stadium. Problem was that the MetroStars were mesmerized during the first 45 minutes as Diallo scored two goals for the Mutiny (6-5) and created confusion for the MetroStars' defenders.</p>
        <p>The Mutiny's lone attacking player in a 4-5-1 formation, Diallo showed skill and speed all night. He did not need either when he scored his first in the game's 38th minute. After a foul about 25 yards from the MetroStars' goal, Tampa Bay's Carlos Valderrama sent a cheeky chip over the defensive wall. Goalie Mike Ammann raced out of his goal but missed the ball. Diallo ran onto it, shook off Ramos and nudged the ball over the line. The assist was Valderrama's 100th point in Major League Soccer and his league-leading 11th assist of the season.</p>
        <p>Diallo, who toyed with defender Mark Semioli much of the game, struck for his ninth goal of the season seven minutes later when Ammann made another tentative play in goal, and the Senegalese striker headed home a crossing ball from Eric Quill. In addition to his goals, Diallo set an M.L.S. record for most shots on goal in a game with nine, seven in the first half.</p>
        <p>''There's no question that we weren't very organized in the first half,'' Zambrano said. ''And I have to say that I was surprised by Diallo's ability. He's big, strong, fast and obviously difficult to defend.''</p>
        <p>The MetroStars showed a glimmer early in the second half when Ramos deftly controlled the ball along the right sideline before cutting toward the middle of the field. A neat 1-2 passing combination with Adolfo Valencia eventually sent the Colombian into the penalty area before he beat Garlick with a low shot to the far post.</p>
        <p>With time running out in regulation, Zambrano pulled Semioli and put in midfielder Chung with less than five minutes to play. The change quickly paid dividends when Chung sent a cross from the left into the area. Valencia trapped it, turned on a defender and blasted a shot into the top of the net from about 8 yards away to tie the game.</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>LOTHAR MATTHAUS, who missed the game against Tampa Bay because of a one-game suspension for accumulating yellow cards in three straight games, left Saturday for Germany. His sold-out farewell match is in Munich on Friday, and Matthaus will play one half for the German national team and one half for Bayern Munich. Matthaus will then begin training with Germany in preparation for next month's European Championships in Belgium and the Netherlands. . . . With the addition of CLINT MATHIS during the week (acquired from Los Angeles when the Galaxy signed the Mexican star LUIS HERNANDEZ), the MetroStars' hard-working MARK CHUNG was supplanted in the midfield and did not start for the first time in 10 games this season. He came on as a substitute late in the game. . . . The MetroStars' other recent acquisition, ROY MYERS, came on as a second-half substitute for ALEX COMAS. . . . Tampa Bay's STEVE RALSTON missed his first game since July 4, 1997, (58 straight games) because of a severe bruise in his right leg sustained last week against Columbus. Ralston was named to the United States roster for next month's Nike U.S. Cup.</p>
