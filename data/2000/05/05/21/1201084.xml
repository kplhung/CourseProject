        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thank you for the article on Burt Lancaster [''Burt Lancaster's Melancholy Brawn'' by Rick Marin, May 7]. I worked with him on his last picture, ''Promessi Sposi,'' and found him courteous and conscientious. He was having trouble learning his lines, so together with his beautiful secretary we drilled and repeated until he felt secure. I was extremely protective of him because, in spite of the shabby treatment he was subjected to, he seemed unwilling to assert himself. And he had ample reason to throw a tantrum: he was treated abominably. The details are unimportant except for one incident. When I rose angrily to defend him one miserable day, he pulled me aside and said, ''Murray, don't waste your time on these bums.'' The old lion may have lost a few of his teeth, but not a bit of his dignity.</p>
        <p>One more thing. We happened to meet in Rome shortly after his triumph in ''Atlantic City,'' and when I complimented him on his well-deserved praise, all he said was, ''Sometimes you get lucky.''</p>
