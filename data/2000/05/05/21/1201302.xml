        <p>Vermin. There it was in blue and white, highlighted for all cyber-world to see. Vermin at Le Bernardin. Vermin, ruthless and undiscriminating, the great equalizer of the restaurant world.</p>
        <p>It was a tough week for restaurants in the nation's toughest town, as the New York City Department of Health began posting inspection reports on the World Wide Web. From the humblest Dunkin Donuts to the extra-chic Le Bernardin, their dirty linen, so to speak, was on display.</p>
        <p>So intense was the interest in the misdeeds of the eating establishments that the department's Web site was paralyzed within hours of its opening on Wednesday morning. By the afternoon, the site was getting 23,000 hits an hour, far more than it could handle, and by Friday visitors were still being turned away because of high traffic.</p>
        <p>The Internet site (http:// 207.127.96.244/webfood/search.htm) provides summaries of inspection reports for each of the city's 18,000 restaurants. Some restaurateurs who felt scorched by the reports complained that the Health Department did not provide enough information.</p>
        <p>For example, the staff at Le Bernardin, consistently rated one of the finest restaurants in the city, bristled at the report of ''vermin or other live animal'' in their food storage, preparation or service areas. What really happened, said Eric Ripert, the restaurant's chef, was that an inspector found mice droppings in a single bag of flour. ''We talked to our purveyor right away and they changed all the flour,'' he said. ''I don't think we have a mouse in the house.''</p>
