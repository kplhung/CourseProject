        <p>ONE way to gauge the vibrancy of a city's restaurant culture is to count the number of three-star or four-star establishments. Like the Dow, however, this approach may yield a false result. It would put Las Vegas in the same league as San Francisco or Chicago. A more reliable measure -- call it the French scale -- is the number of restaurants that deliver good, well-executed food in a civilized atmosphere. They do not want to be hot. They will never develop a scene. In the republic of dining, they constitute the solid, tax-paying, law-abiding bourgeoisie.</p>
        <p>Tocqueville is one of these, a paid-up member of the middle class. In a small, trapezoidal room off Union Square, it is a quiet haven of good taste, good food and good service. The menu is limited. The decor is done with a very light touch. The lemon-color walls, gold raw-silk curtains and banquettes upholstered in blue and gold suggest luxury without overburdening the room. Diners restlessly looking for the next thing might easily pass Tocqueville by. That's fine. It leaves a little breathing room for the rest of us.</p>

        <p>ONE way to gauge the vibrancy of a city's restaurant culture is to count the number of three-star or four-star establishments. Like the Dow, however, this approach may yield a false result. It would put Las Vegas in the same league as San Francisco or Chicago. A more reliable measure -- call it the French scale -- is the number of restaurants that deliver good, well-executed food in a civilized atmosphere. They do not want to be hot. They will never develop a scene. In the republic of dining, they constitute the solid, tax-paying, law-abiding bourgeoisie.</p>
        <p>Tocqueville is one of these, a paid-up member of the middle class. In a small, trapezoidal room off Union Square, it is a quiet haven of good taste, good food and good service. The menu is limited. The decor is done with a very light touch. The lemon-color walls, gold raw-silk curtains and banquettes upholstered in blue and gold suggest luxury without overburdening the room. Diners restlessly looking for the next thing might easily pass Tocqueville by. That's fine. It leaves a little breathing room for the rest of us.</p>
        <p>The restaurant is the late-arriving offspring of Marco Polo, the catering place next door, started 10 years ago by Marco Moreira and his wife, Jo-Ann Makovitzky. Sometimes delay is a good thing. Mr. Moreira, with his supply lines already well established, had access to good raw materials, putting him ahead of the game before he started. His peas say spring, even when the world outside is stalled in winter. Scallops, surprisingly flavorless and slightly bitter even in very good restaurants around town, have a concentrated richness at Tocqueville that helps them hold their own when paired with foie gras. The lamb has the herbal flavor that American lamb usually doesn't.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Moreira controls himself, he sends out dishes perfectly suited to his sparely elegant dining room. Billy Bi soup, the oddly named classic from France's Atlantic coast, is beyond praise. Fat mussels, in the pink of health, float languidly in a concentrated saffron meuniere broth with a briny tang and just the right citric spark from a touch of lemon grass and lime leaf.</p>
        <p>Its only fault is to overshadow two fine appetizers. Warm, meaty sardines, dressed in a plush brown-butter-and-olive vinaigrette, find the perfect acidic partner in little oven-cured tomatoes. A warm crottin de Chavignol, on baby greens, seems orthodox, but asparagus tips and quivering nuggets of beet mousseline add a touch of distinction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moreira takes a robust approach to most entrees. His roasted rack of lamb is surrounded by braised artichokes, mushrooms and fava beans in a red-wine reduction, and to show off the meat, he turns herb-marinated lamb shoulder into rillettes filled out with savoy cabbage. Sweet potato puree and a ragout of chestnuts, pearl onions and lardons make a deeply flavored complement to moist roasted venison loin. Making the most of his exceptionally flavorful scallops, Mr. Moreira piles it on, with a thick, aggressively salted slab of seared foie gras and braised artichokes, mushrooms and fava beans.</p>
        <p>In a menu as abbreviated as Tocqueville's, mistakes hurt. Osso buco braised in Normandy apple cider misfires. The cider, thin and tart, does not offer the needed richness, even when backed up by maple-roasted green apple. The whole idea has an uneasy feel to it. And wasabi-crusted salmon is a disaster. The alleged wasabi fails to stand up and be counted, and the salmon, a thoroughly ordinary piece of fish, gets lost in a mucky, muddled vegetable ''meli-melo'' (the word is French for ''hodgepodge'' and is cruelly accurate in this case). Black-truffle risotto is merely adequate, although firm peas and tender pea sprouts add a fresh touch.</p>
        <p>Michael Finehirsh's desserts do honor to the menu. Mint ice cream has always seemed to me an unnecessary idea, but Mr. Finehirsh had a surprise up his sleeve. His warm chocolate cake, just gooey enough on the inside, came with a scoop of green ice cream permeated with a mint flavor so pristine that it instantly banished all memory of scoops past, with their overtones of sticky peppermint candy. His walnut pudding steamed in sherry failed to deliver. It was dry and nearly flavorless. But his upside-down banana tart is a little marvel, a small palisade of fat banana chunks encircling a disk of almond shortbread. Dripping with caramel, it's teamed up with a ball of brown-sugar ice cream.</p>
        <p>Tiny as Tocqueville is, it never feels cramped. The spacing between tables is generous, given the floor space, and the service, which could easily feel intrusive and hovering, achieves a laudable transparency. The fundamentals, in other words, are sound. There's a square deal implicit in the idea of a neighborhood restaurant. Tocqueville, with style and grace, honors its end of the bargain, and then some.</p>
