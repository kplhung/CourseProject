        <p>A Superior Court judge ordered the Bergen County sheriff today to stop blocking construction of a new county jail but backed the sheriff's demand that other top county officials  meet with him to explain why the jail project has taken longer than expected and is millions of dollars over budget.</p>
        <p>Workers are to return to the job on Wednesday, two days after the sheriff, Joseph L. Ciccone, announced that he was halting work on the project until county officials explained the delays and cost overruns.</p>
        <p>The two-day delay will cost $25,000 to $50,000 because the workers still have to be paid for the days off, said Thom Ammirato, a spokesman for William P. Schuber, the county executive.</p>
        <p>Today, Judge Sybil R. Moses of  State Superior Court, acting on a request from Mr. Schuber for an injunction against the sheriff, said the work must continue. The new jail, at River Street and East Broadway in downtown Hackensack, will hold 1,128 inmates and is expected to cost more than $60 million, even though the price of the project was estimated at $45 million when it was first approved in 1993.</p>
        <p>The first phase of the project, which has room for 850 inmates, was completed in March. Work is continuing on the second phase, which will house an additional 278 inmates,  a 125-seat lecture hall and administrative offices. Mr. Ciccone, who was elected sheriff in 1998, questioned the need for more jail space when there are only 610 inmates now.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Ciccone said the sheriff was pleased with Judge Moses' order because it also allowed the sheriff to appear at a May 10 Bergen County Freeholders meeting to voice his objections to the jail project. The judge ruled that county officials must meet with Sheriff Ciccone within 30 days to discuss his concerns.</p>
        <p>''We got what we requested,'' said Bob Nesoff, communications director for the sheriff. ''We're looking for ways to keep some handle on what's going on.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schuber and other county officials had criticized the sheriff for his complaints, saying they were merely a way to mask his own failings in running his department.</p>
