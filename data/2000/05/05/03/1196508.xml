        <p>Even though the world's greatest marathon runner cleared the last piece of government red tape to become an American citizen yesterday, there is considerable uncertainty about whether he will ever cross the tape at the finish line Oct. 1 at the Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>Khalid Khannouchi, the Moroccan-born runner who is the world record-holder in the marathon, left important questions unanswered yesterday as he was naturalized in a ceremony in Houston. It is still not known whether he will compete in the Olympic trials on Sunday in Pittsburgh, only three weeks after running the London Marathon, whether he would have a realistic chance of qualifying for the Sydney Games and whether he would subject himself to further injury that could ruin his career.</p>
        <p>Khannouchi, who lives in Ossining, N.Y., is expected to announce his intentions today at a news conference in Manhattan. Some running experts doubt that he will run, and his own trainer cautioned against it after Khannouchi aggravated ankle and hamstring injuries during the London Marathon.</p>
        <p>However, his wife, Sandra, who is also his agent, has given conflicting statements about the seriousness of his injuries. And it could be that Khannouchi feels obligated to compete, given the cadre of people who have helped him gain his citizenship, and given nationalistic pressures to win an Olympic gold medal.</p>
        <p>The marathoner qualified for naturalization under an immigration rule, normally used by the military, that grants citizenship to spouses of American citizens working abroad for American companies. Sandra Khannouchi recently took a job in Madrid with a San Diego-based company called Elite Racing.</p>
        <p>Khalid Khannouchi came to the United States to compete in the World University Games in 1993 and remained because he felt he was being treated unfairly by Moroccan track officials.</p>
        <p>''I'm extremely happy that my quest for U.S. citizenship has been successful,'' Khannouchi said in a statement. ''I look forward to competing in national and international championship events as an American citizen.''</p>
        <p>Later, at a news conference in a meeting room of the Houston City Council, Khannouchi declined to reveal his plans for the marathon trials, indicating he might do that today. Asked about his physical condition, he admitted to being tired, but added: ''It's not only physical. It's also mental. I been through a lot of problems, but what I want to say is it's over now. I don't want to think about what happened in the past. I don't want to think about the past. I just want to clear my mind. I want to take a long vacation and think what's the next schedule.''</p>
        <p>Aside from whether Khannouchi will compete Sunday, an equally important question is whether he should compete. Most elite marathoners run no more than two marathons a year, much less two in three weeks. If Khannouchi competes in the trials and the Olympic marathon, he will have run four races of 26.2 miles in a period of 12 months, which would undoubtedly put a severe strain on his muscles, joints and connective tissue. His Ireland-based trainer, Gerard Hartmann, told NBC's Olympic Web site that ''Khalid has had injuries that could curtail his career.'' Khannouchi told reporters yesterday that he would consult with Hartmann again before making a decision.</p>
        <p>''I tell athletes you never, ever start a marathon injured,'' said David Martin, a professor of physiology at Georgia State University, who coaches marathon runners and who is chairman of sports science of USA Track and Field, the national governing body. ''At the elite level, the marathon is tragic in terms of what it can do to destroy your career, particularly with injuries related to motion. I hope whatever decision is made is good for Khalid's career as an athlete and not for who is going to profit.''</p>
        <p>In a recent interview, Khannouchi said unequivocally that he would not run both the London Marathon and the Olympic trials. However, Sandra Khannouchi began saying before London that he might consider both. Her statements followed a talk with Harry Gee, Khannouchi's Houston-based attorney, who said he learned from a reporter that Khannouchi was running London; he expressed irritation that Khannouchi evidently did not plan to enter the Olympic trials.</p>
        <p>''We had a much more comprehensive discussion after that occasion,'' Gee said in a recent interview. ''Our purpose of being involved is to help the U.S. get a gold medal. If that wasn't his purpose, certainly we would appreciate being made aware of those circumstances.''</p>
        <p>If Khannouchi does not enter the trials, he could still make the Olympic team at 10,000 meters at the national track and field trials in July in Sacramento. In the 10,000, he would have only an outside chance for a medal. In the marathon, a healthy Khannouchi would be favored to win America's first gold medal since Frank Shorter's victory at the 1972 Munich Olympics. And though he is a Moroccan native, a victory would nevertheless be a boost to a bleak American distance-running program. He set the world record of 2 hours 5 minutes 42 seconds last October at the Chicago Marathon. His personal best is four minutes faster than the next American.</p>
        <p>Track and field's international governing body has said that Khannouchi would not need permission from Morocco to compete for the United States in Sydney. Even if he did need permission, Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, would probably intervene with the Moroccan federation, given his stated determination to have the world's best athletes compete in the Olympics. A healthy Khannouchi could essentially match the other Americans with a ''jog in the park'' at the trials, Martin said, but an injured Khannouchi ''comes back to the other runners' level of fitness.''</p>
        <p>How hurt is Khannouchi? His wife has given contradictory statements in recent days, telling reporters that her husband's injuries were both potentially career threatening and relatively minor.</p>
        <p>''I think he's probably going to run, but I think he's going to have his work cut out to finish in the top three,'' said Mark Coogan, a 1996 Olympian and one of the favorites on Sunday. ''We may not run 2:08, but we're not bums.''</p>
        <p>Khannouchi, David Morris and Joe LeMay are the only three Americans who have achieved the Olympic ''A'' qualifying standard of 2:14. But even if Khannouchi runs, there may not be a large margin for error in making the team. Complicating matters are a hilly course in Pittsburgh and temperatures that could reach the high 70's or 80.</p>
        <p>He could best control his destiny by winning or finishing in the top three. However, even a top-three finish may not guarantee an Olympic berth under the complicated formula that determines qualifiers. If the winner runs slower than 2:14 and is someone other than Khannouchi, Morris and LeMay, only the winner would qualify for Sydney. There are other possibilities in which Khannouchi could finish in the middle of the pack, or even last, and still qualify for the Olympics because he has already met the A standard.</p>
        <p>''I'm glad for the guy; I think he's doing it for the right reasons,'' Coogan said of Khannouchi's citizenship. ''It will be interesting to see how well he does if he runs. If he kills everyone, he might as well wear a cape and an 'S' on his chest.''</p>
