        <p>The Clinton administration plans to announce today that it is strengthening its policy on regulating the safety of genetically engineered foods, an administration official said last night.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, biotechnology companies would be required to talk to regulators at the Food and Drug Administration about the safety of the foods before they are sold, the official said. Under the current policy, that discussion is voluntary, leading critics to say that regulators may not even know about all of the genetically engineered foods being sold.</p>
        <p>The nation's largest food companies had asked the administration for the change to help calm the growing consumer fears about the safety of such foods, which are now included as ingredients in most processed foods sold in American supermarkets.</p>
        <p>''The goal is to increase consumer confidence in the food supply,'' said the official, who would speak only on the condition of not being named.</p>
        <p>But some consumer groups criticized the plan last night, saying that it did not go far enough. The groups have demanded that such foods be labeled and tested for safety before they are approved for sale.</p>
        <p>''Talking is not testing,'' said Andrew Kimbrell, director of the Center for Food Safety, a nonprofit group in Washington. The center has filed a lawsuit against the F.D.A., contending that its current policy on genetically engineered foods is illegal.</p>
        <p>The nation's largest trade group of food companies quickly praised the administration's plans.</p>
        <p>''We believe the steps as they have been outlined to us are appropriate and responsive to the discussions that we've been having with F.D.A. officials and other government officials over the last few months,'' said Gene Grabowski, vice president for communications at the trade group, the Grocery Manufacturers of America.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jane E. Henney, the food agency administrator, is expected to announce the changes at a news conference that may also include Dan Glickman, the secretary of agriculture.</p>
        <p>The administration is also expected to ask for comments on new guidelines for food companies that want to label their products as being free of genetically engineered ingredients. Without those guidelines, regulators can easily challenge companies that try to label their foods.</p>
        <p>The administration has repeatedly assured consumers that all genetically engineered foods now being sold are safe to eat. But officials are under pressure to do more to reassure consumers because of a growing global debate over the safety of genetically engineered plants and the foods that are harvested from them.</p>
        <p>European countries no longer buy corn grown by America's export-dependent farmers because of the concerns. And consumer fears are now spreading to Asian countries like Japan, and more slowly to the United States.</p>
        <p>A few American food companies, worried that consumers could boycott their products, have decided to avoid genetically engineered ingredients. Frito Lay, for instance, has asked the farmers that supply it with corn not to plant genetically engineered varieties.</p>
        <p>Genetically engineered crops, first sold in 1995, have quickly become a success. Farmers have bought up the altered seeds, which can save them time and boost productivity.</p>
