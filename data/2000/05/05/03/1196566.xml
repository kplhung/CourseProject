        <p>Re ''Blackout of ABC on Cable Affects Millions of Homes'' (front page, May 2):</p>
        <p>We have been held hostage by Time Warner, which can do whatever it wants without fear of customers' deserting for another company. Time Warner's withholding of ABC's programs points out the need for competition in the cable industry. We currently have a choice of phone service, gas and electric, but not cable? That's ridiculous! If there were another choice, I would switch my service instantly.</p>

        <p>This issue certainly illustrates how a Time Warner-America Online merger would adversely affect consumers. We need more choices, not fewer.</p>
