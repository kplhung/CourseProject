        <p>THE murder, as described by the Bridgeport police, was pure evil. Leroy Brown Jr., 8,  was executed for an act of innocence. He told the truth.</p>
        <p>B. J., as he was known, was prepared to testify in the killing of his mother's boyfriend, thought to be the act of a drug dealer, Russell Peeler. Then, one cold morning last January, B. J. and his mother, Karen Clarke, were found shot to death in their house on a dead-end street in a residential area of the North End.</p>
        <p>B. J.'s death was a culmination of adults' letting him down. He was ensnared in the criminal case after witnessing a shooting that apparently grew from a drug dispute between his mother's boyfriend, Rudolph Snead Jr., and Mr. Peeler. Once B. J. agreed to tell what he saw, the people who should have protected him failed.</p>
        <p>Adults have been trying to make up for what happened to B. J. ever since. Prosecutors began presenting evidence in court yesterday against Mr. Peeler, a convicted drug dealer and murderer, who they say ordered his brother, Adrian, to kill B. J. and Ms. Clarke. (Adrian Peeler will be tried later.) Legislators named a law for B. J. and his mother that strengthens the state's witness protection program.</p>
        <p>But one gesture that certainly would have meant the most to B. J. has hit a snag.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the murders, the city Parks Commission voted to rename a small park next to the North End Boys and Girls Club for B. J. Everyone agreed it was a fitting tribute to a boy who favored Chicago Bulls shirts with Michael Jordan's number, and who was a demon on the cracked courts beside the club where he spent his afternoons.</p>
        <p>''He'd get the ball and crawl through your legs,'' Edwin Torres, 12, said on Monday, recalling a trademark B. J. move. ''If he was still alive, right now, he'd always play there.''</p>
        <p>Club officials hoped the park would reinforce the message that they strained to send to the children: B. J. was heroic for telling the truth. A refurbished park could serve another purpose. The front of the club now faces the razor-ribbon fencing around the Bridgeport Community Correctional Center: hardly a positive vista for children. Club officials envisioned reconfiguring the club so it would face a park with new basketball courts, a tot lot and other features of an urban refuge, which the club represented for B. J.</p>
        <p>''The park would remind the kids that B. J.'s eight years were not in vain,'' said Ken Bruno, the club's executive director. ''I want his memory to live on for our children.''</p>
        <p>But more than a year later, the park remains a chewed-up lot with broken benches, rattling basketball hoops without nets, and no plaque for B. J. Now city officials say they may use the land for a track for a neighboring high school, throwing into question where the B. J. Brown Park will end up. ''There will be a park in the city named for him,'' said Christopher Duby, a spokesman for Mayor Joseph P. Ganim. ''If it will be there or in the area is the question.''</p>
        <p>BUT some see the city as fumbling a pledge to honor a child who was killed for helping the police.</p>
        <p>''People already don't trust the police,'' said Sgt. David Daniels, president of the Guardians, a black police officers group, which recently cleaned the park. ''You don't give them something then take it back. That makes it worse.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Clarke's relatives have asked that B. J.'s name not be connected to the park, given its condition. They have sued the city, saying the police failed to protect B. J. The police say they removed protection at Ms. Clarke's request.</p>
        <p>If the killings are reverberating with adults here as the trial opens, the memory of B. J. is still alive with his buddies at the club.</p>
        <p>Ivan Torres, 11, said he remembers his friend whenever he gets on the court. ''I think about all the times me and B. J. used to play basketball,'' Ivan said. ''He always used to beat me.''</p>
        <p>Ivan remembers B. J. dog-paddling his way to the deep end of the pool and telling jokes and always getting the latest Michael Jordan sneakers. And he remembers when B. J. was killed. ''When I went to his funeral I started crying,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He likes the idea of a park named for his friend. ''They should take paint and put a big B. J. on the ground,'' he said. Then he smiled and headed off to play soccer.</p>
