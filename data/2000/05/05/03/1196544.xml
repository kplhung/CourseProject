        <p>After a barrage of fiery talk critical of the Justice Department's raid to retrieve Elian Gonzalez, Senate and House Republicans are distancing themselves from the case, no longer sure that hearings are warranted.</p>
        <p>Descriptions of ''jack-booted thugs'' and ''storm troopers'' have been all but muted in the last few days, replaced by a cautious call for answers, maybe even just written ones, from the Justice Department about its decision to send heavily armed agents into a private home.</p>
        <p>While several prominent Republicans, including Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, still want to delve publicly into the Elian case, many others have come to believe that doing so could be a grand political miscalculation.</p>
        <p>Those Republicans, ranging from conservative to moderate, have helped tone down the rhetoric surrounding the Justice Department's raid on the Miami house of Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>In part, members of Congress are heeding public opinion surveys showing that most Americans agree with Attorney General Janet Reno's decision to raid the house; disagree with the boy's Miami relatives who seek to prevent his return to Cuba; and scorn Congress's desire to dredge up the details of the raid once again. The members also recognize the political danger of hearings, which tend to become overly partisan and often paint Republicans as overzealous.</p>
        <p>''It could be turned into political theater, and I don't think anyone wants that,'' said Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate. ''I'd like to get some answers to some questions, but I don't think we need a big show.''</p>
        <p>Senator Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine, echoed several colleagues' comments when she said she worried that hearings would be viewed as just more posturing on a case that many feel has already been overpoliticized.</p>
        <p>''It would look like a lot of political grandstanding, and I would be concerned about that,'' Ms. Snowe said. ''This could be done without hearings.''</p>
        <p>In his weekly news conference, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, seemed to search for the mildest characterizations he could find to discuss the case. After calling the photograph of a federal agent with a submachine gun removing Elian from a closet in the Miami house ''frightening,'' Mr. Armey said members needed ''to sit down and talk about'' hearings.</p>
        <p>''I don't know the answer to whether or not a hearing will be necessary,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Even Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, who had referred to the agents who seized Elian as storm troopers, has lowered the volume as he considers a Senate run. At a speech in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., on Friday, he did not call the raid ''unconscionable,'' as he previously had; nor did he lay blame for the raid, as he did earlier last week, on ''Fidel Castro, Bill Clinton and Janet Reno.''</p>
        <p>John Kingdon, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Michigan, said Republicans might have initially misread the Elian case, especially the level of outrage about the raid and the photograph of the agent with the gun. In addition, he said, they appeared to underestimate the power of another set of photographs, those of a beaming father and son.</p>
        <p>Their calculations also shifted after Ms. Reno and her deputies appeared on television numerous times to defend their actions. While Republicans say legitimate questions remain, the Justice Department has tried to address concerns about cost and the search warrant. And Ms. Reno has spoken of the events leading up to the raid.</p>
        <p>''They have really miscalculated the political benefits,'' Mr. Kingdon said of the Republicans.</p>
        <p>At this point, Senate hearings would most likely last one or two days and focus on whether the raid was legal and proper, Senator Lott said. The House has said it will begin a ''preliminary inquiry.''</p>
        <p>The Republican retreat began last week when Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who had called a hearing for this Wednesday, postponed it because the Justice Department failed to produce the information he sought. On Sunday, Mr. Hatch suggested that his committee might not hold hearings if the documents adequately explain the department's decision.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Hatch said he still awaited the documents. He also criticized Ms. Reno for making television appearances while pleading for more time to collect the documents.</p>
        <p>From the start of the case in November -- when Elian was rescued in the Atlantic Ocean after a boat carrying fleeing Cubans sank, claiming the life of his mother -- many Republicans were quick to side with Cuban-Americans in Miami who fought to keep the boy in the United States, even if it meant separating him from his father in Cuba.</p>
        <p>Top Republicans leaders, including presidential candidates, unleashed sharp attacks on Fidel Castro and argued that the boy's case should be heard in a state family court, even though it has no jurisdiction over an immigration case.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore, treading carefully, broke with the Clinton administration and also suggested that the case was best left to the courts.</p>
        <p>In January, with Congress just back from its recess, Republicans pushed for a bill to make Elian a citizen. But in another retreat, Republican leaders dropped the effort, without saying so outright, after it became clear they lacked the votes in their own party to push the bill.</p>
        <p>A number of Republicans viewed the case as a family issue -- a son kept from his father -- and found it difficult to support any measure that suggested that the two should not be reunited. They were not the most vocal, but their influence was considerable.</p>
        <p>At stake is a crucial group of Cuban-American voters, which leans Republican but helped deliver Florida to President Clinton in 1996. Some analysts say Republicans were just trying to help George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, win Florida.</p>
        <p>''Some would suggest that if Gore can deny Bush Florida, Gore would be hard to beat,'' said Brian Kennedy, a Republican political consultant. ''Republicans want to remind people that it was the Clinton administration that came in and pointed guns to take this boy back.''</p>

        <p>New Police Chief in Miami</p>
        <p>MIAMI, May 2 (AP) -- A Cuban immigrant, Raul Martinez, was sworn in today as Miami's first Hispanic police chief, filling a position left vacant by political turmoil after the raid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Martinez, 50, replaces William O'Brien, who resigned after Mayor Joe Carollo fired the city manager, Donald Warshaw.</p>
