        <p>With one eye on the nation's new-found wealth and another on a burst of energy at many arts institutions across the country, the Ford Foundation has a new program to link the two trends.</p>
        <p>Called New Directions/New Donors, it will provide $40 million in one-time challenge grants of $1 million to $2.5 million each to 28 arts institutions that have creative new programs.</p>
        <p>''We want to jump-start the connection, to tie together the new wealth and the fresh activity in the arts,'' said Susan V. Beresford, the Ford Foundation's president.</p>
        <p>The foundation plans to announce the program and hand out checks at a reception in Manhattan next Wednesday. The recipients, which range from the Western Folklife Center in Elko, Nev. to the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta and the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, have three to five years to find individual contributions to match these grants.</p>
        <p>''This is money beyond our arts budget, which has been going up, and we have not made a block commitment to arts organizations at this scale for decades,'' Ms. Beresford said. The money also is going to a diverse range of organizations, she added; in the past the foundation has tended to focus its arts grants more narrowly on, say, theater.</p>
        <p>Like the newly wealthy whose philanthropy Ford is trying to encourage, the foundation is also flush with assets -- close to $14 billion -- and has to distribute 5 percent each year to keep its tax-exempt status. The foundation's arts budget in the United States has grown to $15 million this fiscal year, up from $9 million in 1996, and it has allocated $10 million for nonprofit arts institutions overseas, up from $5 million in 1996. Ms. Beresford said that Ford was exploring other new arts programs, including grants to individual artists.</p>
        <p>Half the organizations chosen for the matching-grant program have not received money from Ford before, Ms. Beresford said.</p>
        <p>Beginning last spring, she said, Ford canvassed the nation and asked experts to nominate exemplary arts organizations doing creative work that also had strong financial management. ''Many organizations are doing clever work, but they are not at a stage where capital investment would have been wise,'' Ms. Beresford said.</p>
        <p>Working from a list of 200 organizations in dance, literature, media, music, opera, performing arts centers, theater and visual arts, peer panels reviewed the possibilities. Ford then chose 28 groups, three to four in each category, and invited them to apply for the grants, which are supposed to be used for operating endowments, working capital, endowed funds for artistic programs or other permanent capital requirements. Subsequent discussions worked out any hitches with each group, Ms. Beresford said.</p>
        <p>''I was very, very pleasantly surprised to get their call,'' said Bruce Evans, director of the Mint Museum of Art in Charlotte, N.C., which had not received money from Ford before.</p>
        <p>The Mint has been awarded $1.75 million, which will go into its endowment fund supporting exhibitions and to a program to develop a national membership for its craft museum, which opened last year.</p>
        <p>David Gockley, general director of the Houston Grand Opera, which received a $2 million grant and is known for fostering and commissioning American opera, said that Ford had handed organizations ''a hook to access the new wealth.'' He said he planned to put two-thirds of the money into the opera's permanent endowment, where it will help finance an electronic media initiative, including the company's ''Plazacasts'' -- performances simultaneously projected onto large-screens in outdoor plazas -- and soon, video and audio programs on the Internet.</p>
        <p>The Academy of American Poets, which among other things is responsible for making April National Poetry Month, is receiving $1 million. Since 1990 the Manhattan-based academy's budget has grown tenfold; it sponsors poetry readings in five cities and its Web site (www.poets.org) gets four million hits a month.</p>
        <p>''We are stretched very thin and have to become a larger organization,'' said Bill Wadsworth, executive director. ''This is probably the key support we've gotten in our history.''</p>
        <p>With the Ford grant he plans to hire three professional fund-raisers; the rest of the money will fatten the academy's endowment. ''This means we will have the potential to do many more things in our future,'' he said, including adding online poetry resources for secondary schools (www.onlinepoetryclassroom.org) this summer.</p>
        <p>Although many arts organizations are thriving, charitable donations they receive from Americans have  fallen. Giving USA, which is published annually by the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel's Trust for Philanthropy, reported a year ago that in 1998 donations rose in every area except the arts, culture and humanities. While overall charitable giving by individuals, foundations and corporations rose 11 percent to $175 billion, gifts to arts and culture groups fell 1 percent to $10.5 billion. New figures for 1999 are to be announced at the end of this month.</p>
        <p>To accompany the new program, the Ford Foundation is also making a $2.5 million grant to the Nonprofit Finance Fund, which will develop and disseminate information addressing capitalization, endowment management, individual donor development and board leadership at arts institutions.</p>
