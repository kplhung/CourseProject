        <p>Prices of United States Treasury securities were mixed yesterday.</p>
        <p>Treasuries with shorter maturities were higher as investors moved money out of stocks, which were declining, for the favorable return on interest-bearing instruments.

        <p>Prices of United States Treasury securities were mixed yesterday.</p>
        <p>Treasuries with shorter maturities were higher as investors moved money out of stocks, which were declining, for the favorable return on interest-bearing instruments. The price of longer-term Treasuries was lower, however, amid concern that the Federal Reserve would move to raise interest rates, driving bond prices down.</p>
        <p>By late in the day, the benchmark 30-year bond was down 10/32 , to a price of 103 11/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, increased to 6.01 percent from 5.99 percent on Monday, exceeding 6 percent for the first time in six weeks.</p>
        <p>The mixed feelings about the Fed's next move have created some consternation in the bond markets. Michael P. Maurer, a fixed-income strategist at A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons, said.</p>
        <p>''Strong economic data forced the reassessment of conventional market wisdom last week as the consensus for the Fed funds target rate became less certain,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Market participants, he added, are divided between expectations of a quarter-percentage-point increase and a rise of half a point. Until recently, it had seemed fairly certain that the central bank would continue its pattern of gradual rate increases.</p>
        <p>Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, is among those who say that many market participants expect a half-point tightening at the May 16 meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee, as economic growth led by strong consumer spending continues.</p>
        <p>''The Fed seems poised to move aggressively in its pre-emptive strikes against inflationary forces,'' he said. ''Simply put, the risk of economic momentum being sharply curtailed by an aggressive move to a less accommodative posture is considerably less at this juncture than the risk of having an undesirable inflationary bulge result from a somewhat sluggish monetary policy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Maurer of A. G. Edwards said, ''There are several major announcements due this week, which could shake up the markets.'' The data include the Treasury's quarterly refunding on Wednesday, first-quarter productivity and cost figures on Thursday, and April employment figures on Friday. Expectations are for nonfarm payrolls to rise 350,000 and for the unemployment rate to drop to 4 percent.</p>
