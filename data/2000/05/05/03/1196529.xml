        <p>With catcalls, boos and groans, residents showed their displeasure, skepticism and anger last night toward a proposal to reduce traffic congestion on Interstate 287 by replacing the Tappan Zee Bridge, which links Westchester and Rockland Counties.</p>
        <p>A number of the nearly 100 people who attended a hearing at the Westchester County Center -- the first of four public hearings scheduled over the next two weeks -- questioned the estimated $4 billion cost of building a  wider bridge and a proposed commuter rail line across it, and whether the money could be found.</p>
        <p>Residents also said they believed the governor's task force that made the recommendation in a report last month as part of a study of congestion on the 30-mile Route I-287 rushed  to recommend demolishing the current bridge rather than exploring options that residents said would be less costly and disruptive.</p>
        <p>''We are not saying there should not be a replacement bridge,'' said Hazard Gillespie, president of the Tappan Zee Preservation Coalition, a Piermont resident and a retired United States attorney for the southern district of New York. ''But we do say before you reach that conclusion, let's have an independent study.''</p>
        <p>Although John Platt, executive director of the New York State Thruway Authority and a member of the five-person task force, told the audience ''we don't see any land-taking for the Tappan Zee Bridge replacement nor the causeway'' leading up to it, the statement was met with a tide of hisses and moans. There was widespread concern that a wider bridge would inevitably bring more traffic and pollution.</p>
        <p>Members of the governor's I-287 Task Force generally did not answer questions; the hearings are intended to gather opinions. But staff members did present a brief overview of their work, stressing that their report recommended a combination of solutions to ease congestion on Route I-287, from Suffern to the New England Thruway.</p>
        <p>The task force also suggested expanded use of bus shuttles and park-and-ride lots and varying the tolls on the bridge to induce commuters to use it during off-peak hours. But replacing the bridge, it said, was fundamental. A decision on how to proceed is not due for another several months, Mr. Platt said.</p>
