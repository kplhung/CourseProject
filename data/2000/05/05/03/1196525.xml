        <p>Two New Jersey men who the authorities said were paid to kill the wife of a prominent rabbi in Cherry Hill were formally charged today and ordered held in bail, officials said.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said that both men had confessed to their roles in the murder of Carol Neulander, 52, who was bludgeoned to death in her living room more than five years ago.</p>
        <p>Until yesterday, Rabbi Fred J. Neulander, 59, was the only suspect charged in his wife's murder, a crime that has profoundly shaken his former congregation, the largest in southern New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Investigators have said they believe the rabbi wanted his wife dead so he could continue his affair with a woman who had a radio talk show in Philadelphia. The woman, Elaine Soncini, was pressuring him to end his marriage, and prosecutors say he feared divorce proceedings would bring out allegations of infidelity, threatening his position as leader of M'Kor Shalom, the synagogue he had founded 20 years earlier.</p>
        <p>As in the past, Rabbi Neulander's lawyers said today that Ms. Neulander, the owner of two local bakeries, was killed during a robbery, and that their client was not connected to her death.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Neulander, who is free on $400,000 bail, had been facing trial next month on murder and conspiracy charges. With the new revelations, Dennis Wixted, one of Rabbi Neulander's lawyers, said he would ask the judge for more time.</p>
        <p>The two men arrested yesterday, Leonard Jenoff, 54, of Collingswood, and Paul M. Daniels, 26, of Pennsauken, are being held at the Camden County Jail on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.</p>
        <p>An unsparing confession by Mr. Jenoff, a friend of Rabbi Neulander's, added a new dimension to a crime already brimming with lurid detail. An account of the confession was reported today by The Philadelphia Inquirer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jenoff, who worked as a private investigator, said he believed he was being paid to kill an anti-Israeli terrorist, according to prosecutors. Rabbi Neulander, Mr. Jenoff told them, had said that such a crime would be forgiven by God. In addition to a promised payment of $30,000, the rabbi, he said, offered to help find him a job with Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. Only after hearing a news account of the crime the next morning did he learn the true identity of his victim, he said.</p>
        <p>Although both men were charged with murder, Mr. Jenoff did not actually carry out the crime as intended. At the last minute, paralyzed by fear, he offered $7,500 to Mr. Daniels, his roommate at the time, to do the deed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jenoff's lawyer, Francis J. Hartman, said his client had confessed because he was overwhelmed by feelings of guilt. ''He knew the rabbi's trial was coming up and he was afraid he might be acquitted, which he thought would be wrong,'' Mr. Hartman said. ''This clearly was a spontaneous thing.''</p>
        <p>As of this evening, details about Mr. Daniels's life remained unclear. At today's arraignment, he told Judge Linda Rosenzweig of State Superior Court that he was unemployed, suffering from mental illness and living on disability payments. Mr. Daniels, who did not have a lawyer at the hearing, was ordered held on $400,000 bail. Mr. Jenoff's bail was set at $200,000.</p>
