        <p>Bill West was always going to be a star. He had the drive. He had the smarts. He had the ingenuity to know which ideas to claim as his own and which to dump.</p>
        <p>''Opportunity and responsibility,'' Bill East preached.</p>
        <p>''Embrace and extend,'' Bill West preached.</p>
        <p>Bill East was greatly underestimated by the old guard, George Bush and Bob Dole. He upended them and became, heaven help us, the poster boy for his generation, dominating the 90's. His rise was relentless, leaving a trail of enemies behind, using any means at his disposal to rule.</p>
        <p>Bill West was greatly underestimated by the old guard, the mainframers at I.B.M. He upended them and became, heaven help us, the poster boy for his generation, dominating the virtual 90's. His rise was relentless, leaving a trail of enemies behind, using any means at his disposal to rule.</p>
        <p>Bill East, who had an adolescent streak, knew he was being scrutinized for his reckless behavior but was too arrogant to pull back.</p>

        <p>There was blood in the water.</p>
        <p>Jealous rivals lobbied for the downfall of Bill East, and ran to the prosecutor with tales of his nasty deeds.</p>

        <p>Bill East stonewalled and dissembled, giving them nothing and figuring it would blow over.</p>

        <p>The chief executive from this Washington and his prosecutor came from different worlds. They started in mutual mistrust and worked themselves up to true loathing.</p>

        <p>The case built and Bill East was clearly in trouble. It would have helped if he could have shown some humility and remorse. But he was petulant and bitter.</p>

        <p>The Bills spent millions of dollars and hours with high-priced lawyers.</p>
        <p>Some punishment was in order. But the prosecutors overreached, pushing for penalties that seemed radical and even bizarre.</p>
        <p>Despite the zealous pursuit within the Beltway -- or maybe because of it -- Bill East remains very popular.</p>

        <p>Had prosecution become persecution?</p>
        <p>Too hard on Bill East and, more important, too hard on us. He had gone over the line, certainly, but he was far from being the only politician who behaved like a cad. We are, after all, a nation obsessed with sex.</p>
        <p>Too hard on Bill West and, more important, too hard on us. He had gone over the line, certainly, but he was far from being the only capitalist who behaved like a bully. We are, after all, a nation obsessed with money.</p>
        <p>How quickly the two Bills went from dominant to dejected, kicking around their big Washington houses, screening movies, playing golf, wistful about their waning power. Their less charismatic No. 2's have stepped into the spotlight.</p>
        <p>Bill East is intent on repairing his image and plotting his next act. History will show, he insists, that his  nightmare with the Clinton Justice Department was all the doing of his enemies.</p>

        <p>There is even a wave of Bill nostalgia. When you look at the alternatives, these guys start to look pretty good. For better or worse, they're originals.</p>
