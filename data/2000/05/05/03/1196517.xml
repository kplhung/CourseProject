        <p>The police raided an apartment in a Brooklyn housing project on Monday afternoon, arresting six young gang members who had forced out the rightful tenant and converted his home into a drug den, police officials said.</p>
        <p>The gang, known as the Crime Family, threatened to kill the tenant if he did not leave his apartment or if he complained to the police, said Sgt. Anthony Miranda of the Police Department's gang unit.</p>
        <p>Fearing for his life, the man left his apartment at the Unity Plaza Houses at 611 Blake Avenue in East New York, a drab red-brick complex with shattered windows, and moved in with family members elsewhere.  Meanwhile, gang members moved into Apartment 4G, adding deadbolt locks to the door, graffiti to the hallways and terror to residents' lives,  neighbors and police officials said.</p>
        <p>The tenant's forced exile ended only after he complained in March to the New York City Housing Authority, which then referred the matter to the police. At 1:45 P.M. on Monday, housing police broke down the door of the apartment, where gang members had barricaded themselves.</p>
        <p>They found 68 vials of crack, and arrested Tyquan White, 17, David Myrick, 16, Khalief Glover-Dominick, 17, and David Rush, 16, as well as two juveniles, ages 15 and 14, who were not identified because of their age, said Officer Cheryl Cox, a police spokesman. They were all charged with burglary, criminal trespass and criminal possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia.</p>
        <p>''This building here when I come home from work is like Grand Central station, just a lot of traffic,'' one resident said of the drug activity.</p>
        <p>''I just hope and pray every day that I hit,'' he said, producing two lottery tickets, ''so that I can get out of here.''</p>
