        <p>The confrontation between the Chinese authorities and Hong Kong's premier auction houses over the sale of looted imperial treasures has been defused, for now at least, by an unlikely source: a giant Chinese state-owned corporation that became the winning bidder on three of the four contested objects.</p>
        <p>The company, the China Poly Group Corp., which until last year was owned by the People's Liberation Army and is best known for its global weapons sales, recently established a small antiquities museum here with an emphasis on ancient bronzes. Part of its mission is to buy choice Chinese relics abroad and bring them back to the motherland, and as was clear in recent days, it has very deep pockets.</p>
        <p>In Hong Kong auctions at Christie's on Sunday and at Sotheby's today, the Poly Group bought the three objects, bronze animal heads that once helped form a zodiac fountain at the Old Summer Palace north of this city, for a total of $4 million, far above the expected price.</p>
        <p>''We decided to buy these things because they belong to us, they're part of the Chinese people's national treasure,'' said the assistant curator of the new Poly Art Museum, Jiang Yingchun. ''Since the attempts to halt the auction or even bring the relics back by legal means or persuasion had failed, we had to resort to commercial means.''</p>
        <p>The fourth object, a Qing dynasty vase also believed to have been stolen from the Old Summer Palace when it was pillaged by invading British and French troops in 1860, was sold at Sotheby's this afternoon for an equally astounding $2.7 million to an unidentified Beijing antiquities company.</p>
        <p>Since the objects all appear to be returning to China, albeit at premium prices, the immediate tensions seem to have dissipated. But left hanging for the auction houses, and more generally for the booming global market in Chinese antiquities, is a major question: how serious is the government's new aggressiveness over the international trade in Chinese relics, many of which were originally stolen or smuggled out of the country? This week's disputed items were, to be sure, in a special category. The Old Summer Palace, known in Chinese as Yuanmingyuan, or Garden of Perfect Brightness, is idealized here, and the story of its sacking  is taught to every schoolchild as the ultimate symbol of national humiliation.</p>
        <p>Built by 17th- and 18th-century Qing emperors as their summer residence and fantasyland, the palace was actually a vast estate of landscapes, lakes and finely crafted traditional buildings, and even included a a cluster of Rococo marble palaces designed by European Jesuits. The estate was stocked with China's finest arts when it was burned and looted as invading colonial powers forced China to accept the opium trade.</p>
        <p>During its 27 years in Hong Kong, Sotheby's has sold other relics from the Old Summer Palace without any objections from the Chinese government, said Carlton Rochell, the managing director of the China and Southeast Asia division for the auction house.</p>
        <p>But since Hong Kong officially became part of China in 1997, while maintaining a separate legal system, public awareness about relics has increased. After seeing the four items openly marketed as Old Summer Palace treasures, some Chinese officials began to raise complaints last month.</p>
        <p>The Chinese State Relics Bureau stepped in last week, sending a letter to Christie's and Sotheby's asking them not to auction the items in Hong Kong, saying that it would be a deep insult to the Chinese people.</p>
        <p>The auction houses decided to hold their ground, and much to their relief, the Poly Group and the unidentified Beijing dealer apparently decided to win back the objects at almost any price.</p>
        <p>For years the Poly Group was the chief global arms seller in China. It attracted attention a few years ago in the West when a subsidiary was caught smuggling assault rifles into the United States for sale, and later when its chairman, Wang Jun, became known as the Chinese arms dealer who was brought to a White House meeting of political fund-raisers in 1996.</p>
        <p>The Poly Group was forced to separate from the military last year because of a new national policy to end military involvement in business. The company says that its operations are now concentrated in real estate, industry, high technology and tourism.</p>
        <p>Following the model of American corporate philanthropy -- a new concept in China -- the company decided to improve its image by doing visible good and established  the museum in central Beijing.</p>
        <p>Ma Baoping, the assistant director of the museum and a former military officer, said that as company executives traveled overseas, they noticed how many premier Chinese relics are in foreign hands. ''We felt that if we could bring some of these objects back to China, it would be a patriotic act,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Until now the collecting of the Poly Art Museum had focused on ancient bronzes and other relics. The decision to buy the three comparatively recent bronze animal heads this week was made only on Sunday, just before the Christie's auction began, museum officials said. They declined to say whether they had consulted with government officials.</p>
        <p>''In terms of Chinese national dignity and self-respect, you can't measure the importance of these objects in money alone,'' said the Poly curator, Mr. Jiang.</p>
        <p>At the auction today, Sotheby's sold its first disputed item, an intricately decorated 18th-century hexagonal vase, for more than double the estimated value.</p>
        <p>As the bidding began, a man at the rear of the ballroom shouted, ''It is shameful to sell off national treasures of China!'' He was removed without incident, and the bidding quickly narrowed to a duel between the  Beijing company and a collector from Taiwan with ties to an art museum there. The vase has a twin that sold at Sotheby's in Hong Kong in 1988 and now belongs to the Taiwanese museum.</p>
        <p>The second piece, a bronze tiger's head from a zodiac fountain that is believed to have been designed by a Jesuit artist who lived in China, sold for $2 million, more than three times its estimated value of $580,000, with the price driven up by an unidentified telephone bidder.</p>
        <p>The bronze ox and monkey heads sold by Christie's on Sunday, taken from the same fountain, each sold for about $1 million.</p>
        <p>China's over-all position on sales of Chinese relics is unclear. The relics bureau spokesperson said that the goal was simply to get the auctions out of Hong Kong and Chinese territory.</p>
        <p>But a Beijing newspaper quoted a senior official at the relics bureau today as saying that international precedent and law required that objects plundered during wartime must be returned no matter how much time has passed, an opinion that, even if not rooted in international law, could presage more conflict.</p>
        <p>Experts say that no international agreements mandate the return of items stolen so long ago. Still, a more assertive China could, at a minimum, make life difficult for auction houses and dealers hoping to do business on the mainland.</p>
        <p>When objects have been stolen more recently and proof exists, the situation is different: many countries, including China, have signed a 1970 Unesco treaty requiring their return.</p>
        <p>Institutionally Christie's has kept a poker face throughout the dispute, but today executives at Sotheby's said they were relieved by the outcome of the auctions.</p>
        <p>''This was a great resolution because mainland Chinese were able to purchase these things, which clearly the nation was very passionate about having back,'' said Mr. Rochell of Sotheby's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rochell defended the practice of auctioning relics, even those from historically symbolic places like the Old Summer Palace.</p>
        <p>''If these objects weren't traded openly and freely at auction they might have remained underground, and the people from Beijing wouldn't have had the opportunity to buy them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, he acknowledged that the criticism from China surprised and shook the house.</p>
        <p>In future cases of relics involving particular historical or emotional significance, he said, Sotheby's will discuss the sale with the Chinese government in advance, although to what end is unclear.</p>
        <p>''If it was from a known place that was sacked, we'd want to be more careful,'' Mr. Rochell said. ''One has to be very sensitive about the objects that are in an auction.''</p>
