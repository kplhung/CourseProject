        <p>Democrats regained control of the Nassau County Legislature today as Craig M. Johnson easily won a special election to succeed his mother, Barbara, a lawmaker whose death in March cost the party its first majority in the Legislature in 80 years after only a few months in power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson's runaway victory in a bitterly fought three-way race dealt another blow to the county's once-vaunted Republican party.</p>
        <p>The overwhelmingly Republican county stunned the political establishment in November, when a voter rebellion fueled by anger over Nassau's collapsing finances ended decades of one-party rule and gave the Democrats a 10-to-9 majority in the Legislature. Ms. Johnson's death four months later left the Legislature deadlocked, 9 to 9, as the county faced one of the worst fiscal crises in its history.</p>
        <p>With the balance of power at stake, the special election to fill Ms. Johnson's seat in this North Shore district attracted attention across the county and outside its borders by analysts wondering if the anger directed at Republicans had abated.</p>
        <p>Today, in interviews at polling sites from traditionally Democratic areas of the district, like Roslyn, to traditionally Republican stretches of Manhasset and Munsey Park, it appeared that voters were still plenty angry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson, 29, a bankruptcy lawyer, beat both a Republican challenger, Linda H. Green, 52, a former North Hempstead town clerk, and Benjamin L. Zwirn, 48, a Democratic former town supervisor from North Hempstead and a well-known maverick who ran an insurgent campaign on the Green Party line.</p>
        <p>In unofficial results, Mr. Johnson led with 6,774 votes, or 58 percent of the total, to 2,650 votes or 23 percent for Ms. Green and 2,278 votes or 19 percent for Mr. Zwirn, according to The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>''I just want to thank the voters of this district for having the confidence in me, and the confidence in the Democratic Party as the party that can restore fiscal stability to Nassau County,'' Mr. Johnson said tonight. ''The people are tired of politics as usual.''</p>
        <p>The vote capped what can only be described as a topsy-turvy year in Nassau.</p>
        <p>It is a wealthy county that went broke in boom times, a Republican stronghold that voted the Democrats into power, a place where old alliances have been thrown out of the window.</p>
        <p>''I'm steamed,'' said Erika Sotiriou, 65, a registered Republican from Strathmore who was so incensed by what she saw as the mismanagement of the county and so fearful that further tax increases would be required to set things right, that she voted Democratic. ''I'm upset that they let it go this far; now we're going to get zonked,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Another registered Republican, Robert Spitalnik, said he voted for Mr. Johnson because he thought the county had had enough one-party rule. ''It's not so much a vote for Craig Johnson as a vote to see if we can get some checks and balances in this system,'' he said. ''The Republican Party has messed up Nassau County's finances.''</p>
        <p>The root of the political tumult is unquestionably Nassau County's financial crisis. Years of generous labor contracts and the provision of high levels of services to residents without increases in taxes finally caught up with Nassau last year when the county found itself spending more money than it took in.</p>
        <p>The county managed to finish 1999 in the black only after selling its hospital and using its share of the nation's settlement with tobacco companies to plug its budget gap.</p>
        <p>And despite a tax increase that the Republicans passed before losing control of the Legislature in November, the county faces a $200 million budget gap this year. This has led to service cuts, fee increases and threats to lay off county workers.</p>
        <p>And Nassau, which relies on bond sales to meet its expenses, has seen its bonds downgraded to the level just above junk status, making it the worst credit risk in the nation among wealthy suburban counties.</p>
        <p>Thomas P. DiNapoli, the state assemblyman who heads the county's ascendant Democratic Party, said tonight that he saw the vote as an endorsement of the Democrats' efforts to solve the county's fiscal mess. ''There's still work to do,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But putting Nassau back on its feet could entail a number of politically risky options. Some political analysts wondered why any party would want control of the Legislature now.</p>
        <p>''If the Republicans win, they get the chance to be blamed for things a second time, and if the Democrats win, they are still stuck with the problems,'' said Arthur J. Kremer, a former state assemblyman, who practices law in Nassau. ''You've heard of win-win situations? This one could be win-lose.''</p>
        <p>The Republicans may need some victories soon to reassert their strength; when they lost control of the Legislature in November, it was seen as a serious blow to what was considered one of the nation's last great party machines.</p>
        <p>But Republican officials have insisted all along that today's election -- a rare second chance to reclaim power -- was an uphill battle for them that should not be seen as a referendum on their political future.</p>
        <p>Still, the Republicans will need strong showings soon if they are to remain a vital force.</p>
        <p>''This represents the greatest challenge that the Nassau Republican organization has had to face virtually since it began,'' said Alan Eysen, a political consultant who has worked for both parties. ''If it is going to sustain itself as the premier political organization in the country, it's going to have to come back. Otherwise its great era of dominance is going to go the way of the Roman Empire.''</p>
        <p>Tonight, Joseph N. Mondello, the chairman of the Nassau County Republican Party, did not even appear publicly at the county's headquarters in Westbury, where Ms. Green and a few party loyalists joylessly waited for the returns.</p>
        <p>The Democrats, by contrast, were ebullient at their victory party at Finn MacCool's, a bar on Main Street, where they listened to music and munched on crab cakes and mozzarella sticks between victory speeches and backslaps.</p>
        <p>The Democrats fought hard to retain the seat, spending roughly $60,000 on the election, nearly three times what the Republicans spent, and flooding the district with mailings, fliers and volunteers who went door to door. At times today they had nearly 90 workers out on the streets as part of their get-out-the-vote effort, reminding people who had pledged their support earlier in the campaign to go to the polls.</p>
        <p>Ms. Green, the Republican candidate, said that she thought the Democrats had benefited from their spending, and from the fact that Ms. Johnson was such a popular figure that people felt sympathy for her son. ''I wish him well,'' she said.</p>
