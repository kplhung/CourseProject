        <p>The Clinton administration is preparing to evict dozens of protesters camped at the Navy bombing range on Vieques, an island off the coast of Puerto Rico.

If the Navy is welcome after the vote, protesters can then be removed.</p>

        <p>The Clinton administration is preparing to evict dozens of protesters camped at the Navy bombing range on Vieques, an island off the coast of Puerto Rico. Instead of engaging in a fight now, Washington should wait until Vieques residents decide in a vote next year whether they want the Navy to continue to use the island. If the Navy is welcome after the vote, protesters can then be removed.</p>
        <p>Navy training on Vieques has been suspended since April of last year, when a civilian guard was killed in a bombing accident. After months of angry protests by island residents, who are American citizens, the Clinton administration reached an agreement with Gov. Pedro Rossello of Puerto Rico in January.</p>
        <p>The agreement allows the Navy to resume training on the range with inert bombs until a referendum is held next year so that the island's 9,400 residents can choose between two options. They can vote to end all Navy training by May 2003 or allow the Navy to stay and resume its exercises, including the use of live bombs. Washington has promised to give $40 million for economic development on Vieques, provided that training resumes before the vote. The island would receive $50 million more if the residents voted to allow the Navy to stay on.</p>
        <p>But in order to resume training now with inert bombs, federal law enforcement officers will have to remove the demonstrators. Though Governor Rossello has said he would support clearing the bombing range, it is not apparent how that operation will be managed. There is concern that it could result in violence or provoke more protests elsewhere on Puerto Rico.</p>
        <p>A more prudent course would be for the Navy to hold off on training until the Vieques residents vote. The Navy insists it cannot conduct combined combat exercises anywhere in the Western Atlantic but Vieques. But a presidential panel recommended last year that the Navy leave the island in five years, suggesting that alternatives can be found. It is time the Navy left Vieques, unless the islanders affirmatively choose otherwise.</p>
