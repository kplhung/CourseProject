        <p>He has been named The Associated Press Coach of the Year and he was voted the Naismith women's coach of the year honors.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Geno Auriemma, coach of the University of Connecticut women's basketball team since 1985, received the Winged Foot award, given annually by the New York Athletic Club to the coach of the national championship team.</p>
        <p>Auriemma, who guided the No. 1-ranked Huskies to a 74-67 victory over Tennessee in the National Collegiate Athletic Association title game, is the second women's coach to win the Winged Foot award, following Purdue's Carolyn Peck last year.</p>
        <p>The men's award was instituted in 1996 and was won in 1999 by Jim Calhoun, the UConn men's coach, after that team won the national title.</p>
