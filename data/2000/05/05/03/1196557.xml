        <p>The federal authorities completed preparations today to clear demonstrators later this week from a Navy range on Vieques, a small island off Puerto Rico, even as F.B.I. officials continued to express misgivings about the operation they will lead.</p>
        <p>Senior Pentagon officials have insisted that protesters be removed from a bombing range on the island  before training exercises begin. Louis J. Freeh, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other senior law enforcement officials have warned of possible injuries, and even casualties, as federal agents try to remove protesters from a range scattered with live ammunition.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Freeh's questions about the operation have largely been answered, the officials said, especially with an agreement today that the Justice Department will obtain an order from a federal district court in Puerto Rico authorizing the arrest of demonstrators.</p>
        <p>In recent days White House officials and Attorney General Janet Reno agreed to mount the operation before the end of this week, top law enforcement officials said.</p>
        <p>In the face of this standoff, one of the Puerto Rico's top officials accused the protesters today of acting irresponsibly.</p>
        <p>Alfonso Aguilar, the Washington representative of the governor of Puerto Rico, said the protesters were failing to ''respect the truth and respect the will of the majority of Puerto Ricans'' whom he said want the bombing range cleared.</p>
        <p>The demonstrators are protesting an agreement reached on Jan. 31 between President Clinton and Gov. Pedro J. Rossello of Puerto Rico. The plan allows the Navy to resume limited bombing practice with dummy weapons on the Vieques range until a referendum is held.</p>
        <p>The referendum will allow the residents of Vieques to choose between letting the Navy resume full use of the range with live bombs and ammunition or ordering the military to end all training by May 1, 2003.</p>
        <p>For their part, the protesters said that they would refuse to comply with the expected order to leave the military base but that they would not actively resist arrest.</p>
        <p>Protesters held workshops yesterday to practice nonviolent resistance in expectation that agents would haul them off the range today, said Lilda Medina, of the Coordinating Committee for Peace and Justice in Vieques.</p>
        <p>''We thought they would come today,'' Ms. Medina said in a telephone interview. ''Trucks have been moving in and out of the camp since yesterday.''</p>
        <p>This week two Navy ships carrying 1,000 marines and sailors arrived in waters near Vieques to support the federal special weapons and tactics teams that will remove the protesters from the range, on the eastern end of the island. The marines will stand guard around the edge of the range, help dispose of unexploded bombs and provide medical help.</p>
        <p>The Navy has described Vieques as the crown jewel of its training ranges because it is the only site along the East Coast where battle groups can use live ammunition during joint training exercises that include amphibious landings of marines, shelling from ships and aerial bombardment from fighter jets.</p>
        <p>Those exercises were suspended last year when a civilian Puerto Rican security guard was killed in a bombing accident that touched off widespread protests.</p>
        <p>The issue has also entered the Senate race in New York, which has a large population of Puerto Ricans. Hillary Rodham Clinton, the presumed Democratic nominee, called again today for a permanent end to bombing.</p>
        <p>''A small, inhabited island should not be used for target practice,'' Mrs. Clinton said in a statement. ''Until such a referendum occurs, I urge the Pentagon to negotiate a peaceful resolution to this situation.''</p>
        <p>In Vieques, at the Camp Garcia front gate, where about three dozen demonstrators have been holding a vigil for the last several months, the mood among the protesters remained calm.</p>
