      <block class="full_text">
        <p>After a day like yesterday, it is easy to see that C. Michael Armstrong, chairman of AT&amp;T, may have the toughest job in corporate America.</p>
        <p>It was the worst day for AT&amp;T's investors in more than a dozen years, and Mr. Armstrong probably had not had such an unpleasant professional experience since he took over the company in 1997.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T announced quarterly financial results that met analysts' expectations. But the company also warned that its earnings and, perhaps more important, its revenue growth for the full year would be lower than expected.</p>
        <p>The changes are slight. Rather than earning $1.89 to $1.94 a share before special charges, the company now expects to earn $1.80 to $1.85. Revenue after acquisitions had been expected to grow 8 to 9 percent, but the company cut that projection to 7 to 8 percent.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, AT&amp;T's shares fell 14 percent, or $6.8125, to $41.9375, on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the biggest one-day percentage decline in AT&amp;T's stock, one of the most widely held in the nation, since the market crash of 1987.</p>
        <p>Perhaps adding some psychological pain to the financial burn, AT&amp;T ended a trading session for the first time with a lower market value than one of its Baby Bell progeny -- $134 billion to SBC Communications' $144 billion -- according to Thomson Financial Securities Data.</p>
        <p>Since taking AT&amp;T's top job after three decades at I.B.M and a stint running General Motors' Hughes Electronics unit, Mr. Armstrong has been a whirlwind of activity, trying to reinvigorate AT&amp;T and to take advantage of the revolution in digital communications. He has committed more than $90 billion of his shareholders' money to build the nation's biggest cable television operation. He has spent billions of dollars more building the company's torrid wireless division. He is intent on making AT&amp;T the biggest provider of high-speed Internet service to United States consumers.</p>
        <p>Despite yesterday's vertigo-inducing sell-off, all these initiatives are going well. But AT&amp;T simply has not been able to escape its deteriorating legacy as a long-distance telephone carrier and is running out of chances with impatient investors who are hoping that AT&amp;T's future is now.</p>
        <p>With defiance in every word, Mr. Armstrong defended his legacy.</p>
        <p>''There's been a lot of speculation or comment on whether we can grow the businesses that we've invested in and acquired,'' he said yesterday in a telephone interview. ''Take wireless and broadband. We're redefining the AT&amp;T circuit-switched network to one that is both optical and broadband. These are the businesses that we have invested in for the future, and this year they're going to grow over 12 percent and their growth rate is accelerating. Three years ago, we were growing at 1.7 percent and we had a domestic long-distance voice business.</p>
        <p>''The good news about today's results,'' he added, ''is that it is a confirmation that the growth businesses are growing. They are meeting all of their underlying metrics.''</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T said yesterday, however, that its core consumer long-distance telephone business was shrinking even faster than the company had previously led analysts to believe and that its unit that serves business customers had mismanaged some of its biggest accounts.</p>
        <p>Forbearance was not in the air.</p>
        <p>Until yesterday, AT&amp;T had guided stock analysts to expect that revenue for its consumer unit, which is dominated by long-distance telephone sales, would shrink 3 to 5 percent this year. Yesterday, the company said the unit would shrink 5 to 7 percent, a victim of the growing popularity of wireless phones and of low-cost calling plans like its own flat-rate long-distance plan for 7 cents a minute. (AT&amp;T added that if a regulatory plan to which it has agreed takes effect, the decline would actually be 6 to 8 percent.)</p>
        <p>That was not a killer for AT&amp;T. Just about everyone on Wall Street and in the communications business knows that AT&amp;T's consumer unit is shrinking and if the pace is accelerating, well, perhaps that is to be expected.</p>
        <p>What was not expected was the problem in the company's business services unit, which had been consistently robust in recent years.</p>
        <p>In the first quarter, AT&amp;T transferred almost 300 of its biggest corporate accounts to its Concert joint venture with British Telecommunications. The company also moved 1,200 big accounts into a different internal organization that Mr. Armstrong believed had better executive leadership.</p>
        <p>In the shuffle, some customers were neglected, if not lost.</p>
        <p>''We really shuffled too many people too fast across accounts, broke a few relationships,'' Richard Roscitt, the new chief of AT&amp;T's business-services unit, said yesterday in a conference call with financial analysts. ''It is a set of accounts where we frankly did not pay enough attention to the high end.''</p>
        <p>As a result, the company said that the business-services unit would grow by about 8 percent, instead of the previously expected 9 to 11 percent. (By comparison, AT&amp;T's wireless unit is expected to grow 25 to 30 percent, and the company's cable unit 12 to 14 percent.)</p>
        <p>As in the consumer unit, the problem in the business-services operation did not appear huge. In fact, judging strictly by the numbers, a strong case could be made that the magnitude of yesterday's sell-off was an overreaction.</p>
        <p>But when investors have the jitters about a company, as they do about AT&amp;T, it is rarely all about the numbers.</p>
        <p>''I think it's people anticipating another shoe dropping,'' said Richard G. Klugman, an analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. ''It sounded like these were not blips on the radar screen. It sounded like there are fundamental issues that the company will have to deal with.''</p>
        <p>Discounting special charges and some outside investments, AT&amp;T met analysts' expectations by earning 53 cents a share, or $1.7 billion, in the last quarter, down from 61 cents a share, or $1.7 billion, a year earlier. Revenue after acquisitions increased  5.8 percent, to $15.8 billion, from $15 billion in the comparable 1999 period.</p>
        <p>Including all charges, investments and acquisitions, AT&amp;T earned 54 cents a share, or $1.7 billion, up from 38 cents, or $1.1 billion, in the comparable period last year. Reported revenue increased 12.3 percent, to $15.8 billion, from $14.1 billion.</p>
        <p>Continuing its cost-cutting drive, AT&amp;T said it would cut 6,200 jobs, or about 4 percent of its work force, by the end of the year. The company would not specify where in the country the cuts would occur, but more than 1,000 jobs could be lost in New Jersey, home to AT&amp;T's headquarters, according to an executive close to the company.</p>
