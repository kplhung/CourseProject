        <p>Jude Wanniski letter on Apr 29 editorial blames euro's decline on failure of European Central Bank to mop up surplus liquidity resulting from gradual replacement of 11 currencies by single currency</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In your April 29 editorial ''Decline of the Euro,'' you note the ''dashed'' hopes of those Europeans who, when the euro was born 16 months ago, ''boasted that it would challenge the dollar for international supremacy.'' The problem, though, is not that the United States is growing faster than  Europe, but that the single currency is gradually replacing 11 and that the  European Central Bank has failed to mop up the surplus liquidity.</p>
        <p>As old contracts in marks, francs and lire expire and are replaced by euro contracts, individuals and enterprises are running down their old currency balances. Instead of selling assets from its portfolio, the European Central Bank has been trying to stop the decline by raising interest rates. This only further reduces the need for liquidity and puts more in surplus.</p>

        <p>The euro can indeed challenge the superiority of the dollar, but only by using the euro price of gold as a market signal of Europe's liquidity needs.</p>
