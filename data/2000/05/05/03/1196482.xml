        <p>At 10 a.m. precisely, air-raid sirens sounded throughout Israel today and the country froze in its tracks for two minutes to remember the victims of the Holocaust. Drivers stood at attention beside their cars, shopkeepers stepped onto the sidewalk and pedestrians halted in mid-stride, their heads bowed or defiantly upright.</p>
        <p>But this did not happen in Mea Shearim or other strictly Orthodox neighborhoods. In Mea Shearim, as if the call of the siren was a car alarm, religious Jews in black frock coats and black felt hats did not pause, or interrupt conversations, or stop their shopping.</p>
        <p>''Where does this thing of the siren come from?'' said Shai, a young Hasidic Jew with long strawberry-blond side curls, who would not give his last name. ''It's someone else's custom -- the English, the goyim,'' or non-Jews. ''What we as Jews do is recite religious texts. And not just today, but every day. To stand silent, like goyim, is to insult the name of those burned to death for their beliefs.''</p>
        <p>A woman shopper, dressed in a long skirt, her head covered with a tight scarf, agreed. ''God thinks it's a goyish holiday,'' she said of Holocaust Remembrance Day, which is a somber national holiday in Israel. Restaurants, theaters and nightclubs shut down, and schools and radio and television stations devote themselves to Holocaust education.</p>
        <p>''They have their customs,'' she said, nodding toward secular Israel in general. ''We have God.''</p>
        <p>For many Israelis the shunning of Holocaust Day by ultra-Orthodox Jews rubs extra salt in the wounds of a divided society. The haredim -- literally those who tremble before God -- also do not observe Israel's Independence Day or its Memorial Day. But many Israelis consider the Day of the Shoah, as it is known here, to be the one time when the Jews of Israel should stand -- literally -- together.</p>
        <p>''The haredim have set up parallel institutions for everything,'' said Efraim Zuroff, a Holocaust historian, a modern Orthodox Jew and the local director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. ''But one would have hoped that the Holocaust would be the one exception. What did the Holocaust teach us, if not that Jewish unity was essential?''</p>
        <p>The matter is actually a complex internal Jewish dispute, not only about the way that the Holocaust should be remembered but about Holocaust history itself.</p>
        <p>In the haredi world, a string of new books, films and museum projects is sketching out an alternative to the official account of the Holocaust that is taught in Israeli schools and featured at Yad Vashem, the national Holocaust memorial.</p>
        <p>The mainstream account, by this reckoning, overemphasizes the physical heroism and martyrdom of nonreligious Jews who resisted the Nazis. It glorifies the fighters, they say, just as Zionists in Israel exalt the soldiers of the national army in which most haredim, who believe that they serve the country by keeping strictly observed Jewish traditions alive, do not serve.</p>
        <p>The date for Holocaust Remembrance Day, in fact, was fixed by Israel to commemorate the Warsaw ghetto uprising of 1943, in which the underground Jewish Combat Organization led Polish Jews in a four-week revolt against their deportation to Nazi concentration camps.</p>
        <p>''Why do we give more importance to the physical fighters?'' said Rabbi Menachem Mendel Taub, a Holocaust survivor who is known as the rebbe of Kaliv, the Hungarian city whose Hasidic Jewish community he and five generations of ancestors led. ''What about the rabbis and yeshiva students who clung to the religious commandments until the end? Did they not defend the soul of the Jewish people? Are they not as important to Israel today as F-16's and A-bombs?''</p>
        <p>More pointedly, Moshe Gorelick, in an article in a haredi weekly titled ''Even in Israel They Deny the Holocaust,'' said the official Holocaust Day explicitly disdained those who ''kept their godly souls until the last minute'' as ''going like lambs to the slaughter.''</p>
        <p>It is well known here that many haredim avoid Yad Vashem, which almost every other Israeli visits regularly as a schoolchild and a soldier. Most often they cite religious objections to the nude photographs of skeletal Holocaust victims. A deputy mayor of Jerusalem, an ultra-Orthodox Jew, created a stir several years ago when he threatened to cut off funds to Yad Vashem if the ''immodest'' pictures were not taken down.</p>
        <p>But ultra-Orthodox rabbis say the key complaint is ideological. The museum, they say, does not sufficiently pay tribute to religious martyrs, among them rabbis who had visas that would have allowed them to emigrate but stayed in Europe to lead -- and die with -- their followers.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Taub is one who is working to append the official history. He has published two volumes of a Holocaust encyclopedia filled with the stories of pious Jews who observed Jewish law against all odds in the ghettos and concentration camps.</p>
        <p>And he is raising money to build an alternative Holocaust museum in Jerusalem, for which the cornerstone has been laid. Another museum project, by a separate organization, is under way in Bnei Brak.</p>
        <p>After the Holocaust Remembrance ceremonies began on Monday night, the rabbi was interviewed in Bnei Brak, a religious community near Tel Aviv, through his personal secretary. The rabbi does not take questions from a woman; his secretary posed the questions. His assistants placed a large picture frame between the rabbi and this reporter so that his view would be blocked.</p>
        <p>He talked to the ceiling, alternating English from his 17 years in the United States with Hebrew and Yiddish. At the end he offered a blessing, both verbally and in the form of a small plastic pouch containing a 10-agorot coin, worth a few pennies.</p>
        <p>''When somebody is in jail for dozens of years, he promises to himself that when he is released he will do good things,'' the rabbi said. ''Usually his good intentions fade. I promised myself the day that I survived the Shoah that I would think about this day and night. What does a single day, Holocaust Day, mean?''</p>
        <p>To Holocaust survivors and to many of those taking part in the official ceremonies, it means a great deal. About 230,000 Israelis once lived under Nazi rule, according to Israeli statistics released today, and the population of survivors is dwindling. Some 20,000 have died since 1997.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak and other government officials took part in an annual tradition today, reading, with breaking voices, the names of Jews killed in the Holocaust.</p>
        <p>In an editorial, a haredi newspaper, Hamodia, said ''God-fearing'' Jews still use ''these same names, in the same books, in the same customs, and in the same tradition that the opinion-makers in Israel would wish to put in a museum.'' Some religious Jews believe that they themselves are recreating the European Jewish village life that was wiped out during the Holocaust.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zuroff, author of a new book, ''The Response of Orthodox Jewry in the United States to the Holocaust'' (Yeshiva University Press), said he thought that the haredim had a hard time dealing with Holocaust history.</p>
        <p>The very fact of it is difficult for a person of deep faith, as were costly mistakes made by their leaders. Some Hasidic rabbis, for instance, ordered their followers to stay in Europe and not flee, which ultimately was devastating, he said. Then, while some top rabbis perished with their communities, others fled themselves.</p>
        <p>But ultra-Orthodox leaders disagree, and in the streets of Mea Shearim this morning, it came down to something more basic: Holocaust Day is a secular event, dictated by the secular authorities. And the haredim obey what they consider to be the higher authority of the Torah.</p>
        <p>Holocaust Day falls during the Hebrew month of Nissan, a month of celebration, when strictly Orthodox Jews are barred from public expressions of mourning. Modern Orthodox Jews believe that it is literal-minded to think that the ban should apply to Holocaust Day.</p>
        <p>But the strictly observant say that Judaism marks tragic events in the life of Jewish people on Tisha B'Av, a day of fasting and mourning that commemorates the destruction of the First Temple in 586 B.C. and the Second Temple in the year 70. Other Jews, they say, have allowed the Holocaust to dominate their worldview.</p>
        <p>''All Jewish history does not begin and end with the Holocaust,'' said Jonathan Rosenblum, a haredi spokesman.</p>
