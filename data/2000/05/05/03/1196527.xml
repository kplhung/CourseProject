        <p>A Republican senator said at a hearing today that the former head of the Justice Department's campaign finance unit had unsuccessfully urged the appointment of an independent prosecutor to investigate President Clinton and a top executive of the Loral aerospace company.</p>
        <p>The senator, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, made his comments in the questioning of Charles La Bella, the former Justice Department official. Mr. La Bella responded obliquely to Mr. Specter's questions, but did not dispute that he had recommended an outside inquiry of Mr. Clinton and Bernard L. Schwartz, chairman of the Loral Space and Communications Corporation.</p>
        <p>Loral officials had no immediate reaction to the disclosure. Previously, they have defended Mr. Schwartz and said company officials had done nothing wrong in their dealings with scientists in Beijing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz has been one of the Democratic Party's largest donors and had contributed $1.5 million during the 1996 elections. His contributions have continued even as Loral became the subject of a separate federal investigation into whether it broke the law by providing technological help to China's rocket program. At the same time Mr. Schwartz was giving money to the Democrats, his company was seeking government approval for satellite launchings in China.</p>
        <p>It was unclear today whether Mr. La Bella had referred in his memorandum to any specific evidence suggesting that either Mr. Clinton or Mr. Schwartz had engaged in improper conduct. Other officials said they never had any reason to question the legality of the contributions.</p>
        <p>Still, the officials who have read the memorandum written by Mr. La Bella to Attorney General Janet Reno in 1998 said he did urge her to seek the appointment of an independent prosecutor to investigate the matter.</p>
        <p>The issue arose today at a hearing of a Senate Judiciary subcommittee when Mr. Specter referred to passages in Mr. La Bella's memorandum, which is still confidential and whose existence and conclusions have been the subject of reports by several news organizations. In the memorandum Mr. La Bella strongly recommended the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate accusations of fund-raising abuses in the 1996 election.</p>
        <p>''There's a section of your report which deals with Loral on the technology transfer from Loral to the People's Republic of China,'' Mr. Specter said. ''And there was a recommendation as to proceeding as to an investigation for the chief executive officer of Loral, Mr. Bernard Schwartz, who had contributed some $1,500,000 to the Democratic National Committee.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Specter then said that the memorandum indicated that if the Justice Department opened an investigation of Mr. Schwartz, it should also begin an inquiry of Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. La Bella, accepting Mr. Specter's account, replied, ''Hypothetically, if you're going to investigate the person who gave the contribution because you think something was wrong with that because they were seeking a quid pro quo, then it seems to me that part of the area of investigation would be the person who received the contribution.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno rebuffed Mr. La Bella, who wrote his memorandum as he was departing after a sometimes-fractious tenure as head of a high profile investigation into possible campaign finance irregularities stemming from the 1996 election.</p>
