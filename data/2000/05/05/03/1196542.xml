        <p>ARE you a time-famished consumer? Would you like to maximize your personal bandwidth? Do you feel an overwhelming need for location-sensitive information -- say, a review of every Italian restaurant within a mile? Need a reservation? Directions? A limo? While you're on the way, would you like to combine m-commerce with e-commerce by having a human facilitator do a little online shopping for you?</p>
        <p>Oh, and do you have $10 million to invest in a new-media company whose 1999 revenues amounted to zero?</p>
        <p>Those were the questions of the hour at the Hilton Hotel on Monday. Young New Yorkers without neckties or profits were on stage pleading for money for their start-ups, and the place was packed with venture capitalists paying $1,000 apiece for the privilege of listening to them.</p>
        <p>It was the Venture Downtown annual conference, which has gotten so big that it has been moved to Midtown by its sponsor, the New York New Media Association, the industry's trade group. Silicon Alley is not yet Silicon Valley, but the crowd of investors was proof that the world's self-proclaimed financial capital is finally investing some money close to home.</p>
        <p>''New York was a money center helping to fuel growth in Silicon Valley, but until recently there wasn't anything happening here,'' said Alan J. Patricof, one of the city's leading venture capitalists, whose company has an office in northern California. ''We didn't have the networks that existed in Silicon Alley. But now Silicon Alley is growing virally, like the Internet. The number of venture capital companies in New York has quadrupled in the past couple of years. Look at the excitement here today. We've reached critical mass.''</p>
        <p>The number of people working in new media more than doubled since 1997, to 250,000 in the metropolitan area, according to a survey by the industry's trade association. The group's executive director, Alice Rodd O'Rourke, calls Silicon Alley the first major new industry in New York since television.</p>
        <p>''At first,'' she said, ''new-media entrepreneurs here didn't have have the investment flywheel that existed on the West Coast. But thank God for lust and greed and competition. As West Coast venture capitalists were starting to invade by opening up offices here, we started getting venture capitalists in our own backyard.'''</p>
        <p>Like any homegrown industry, this one reflects the local culture, as you could see in the presentations on Monday. One start-up, iStash.com, proposed to teach children how to manage money (and ''in a fun, cool, exciting way'' by using a ''holistic approach to money management''). Limocenter.com offered to provide a limousine instantly anywhere in America to anyone with a telephone or a computer.</p>
        <p>Quixi Inc. promised to provide ''time-famished consumers'' with ''personal bandwidth assistance'' through a technological breakthrough involving a ''human interface.'' Which means that for $19.95 a month you can call up a human being sitting in front of a computer who will place phone calls for you, make restaurant reservations, buy tickets, shop online, and do other tasks without expecting a gift on National Secretary's Day.</p>
        <p>''Quite simply, we make time,'' said Evan Marwell, the co-chief executive officer of Quixi, who had no trouble explaining why the company is aiming first at the local market. ''New York is where time famine was born.''</p>
        <p>FOR devotees of m-commerce (as in mobile), the star of the day seemed to be Jason Devitt, the 31-year-old C.E.O of Vindigo. His company, on West 25th Street, has 17 employees jammed into a 1,000-square-foot loft in what used to be a sewing-machine repair shop.</p>
        <p>Vindigo compiles a database enabling Palm Pilot owners on the move to get directions and learn about stores, restaurants, movies and other attractions in the vicinity. It's available now in New York City (Locally, Vindigo is working with The New York Times Company) and is scheduled soon for other cities.</p>
        <p>The standing-room-only crowd listened raptly as Mr. Devitt described Vindigo as ''the first true location-sensitive advertising platform in the world.'' Afterward, investors lined up to give him their cards. Mr. Devitt explained that, although he was listed in the program as seeking $9 million, he already had that money in hand and didn't need any more at the moment.</p>
        <p>That fact only made him more popular. ''When you're ready for your next round of financing,'' one fund manager said eagerly, ''we'd love to be involved.'' Mr. Devitt politely promised to keep his card and turned to the next supplicant.</p>
