        <p>Where are those charred bits of zeppelin?</p>
        <p>In December 1998, Gov. George E. Pataki said, ''I would think it's more likely that the Hindenburg would come back together than I would step down as governor and become senator.''</p>
        <p>But today, he repeatedly refused to rule out entering the race for United States Senate if Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is forced, because of his prostate cancer, to drop out. The governor stressed that he expected the mayor to remain in the race, and beyond that, he said, ''I'm not going to speculate.''</p>
        <p>The governor's ambiguous statements troubled some prominent Republicans who say they worry that the remarks might detract from the efforts made by Mr. Giuliani and his aides to present the image of a campaign running full throttle and planning to stay that way.</p>
        <p>Late this afternoon, Michael McKeon, Mr. Pataki's press secretary, called a reporter, clearly exercised at the idea that the governor's comments might become the basis of a news article. ''This is not him playing games,'' he said. ''This is him having belief and faith in Rudy.''</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Giuliani's campaign loudly trumpeted a new appointment and the mayor and his advisers talked about their efforts to win the endorsement of the Conservative Party. Bruce Teitelbaum, the mayor's campaign manager, made the two-and-a-half-hour drive here from New York City today to announce that Brendan Quinn, the executive director of the state Republican Party, had been named Mr. Giuliani's statewide field director.</p>
        <p>Ordinarily, that would hardly be the stuff of a news conference. But the race, which pits the mayor against Hillary Rodham Clinton, has been no ordinary campaign, especially since the mayor disclosed his illness last week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Teitelbaum all but said that the appointment, which formalized a role that Mr. Quinn had already been playing, signaled that Mr. Giuliani was in the race to stay. ''This official announcement represents an important investment that this campaign is making in the future,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quinn, whose job description includes coordinating campaign events with county chairmen and elected officials around the state, is a natural choice to plug Mr. Giuliani into the resources of the state party, and to quell the fears of Republicans upstate who complain that the mayor has not campaigned aggressively enough, especially in that region.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said today that he planned to meet with Michael R. Long, chairman of the Conservative Party, though he would not say when or where. Mr. Long has all but ruled out nominating Mr. Giuliani, in large part because the mayor has refused to drop his opposition to attempts to ban the late-term abortion procedure that opponents call ''partial-birth abortion.''</p>
        <p>''I am not going to change my position but beyond that I am not going to discuss the meeting,'' Mr. Giuliani said. He said the timing of the meeting had nothing to do with his announcement last Thursday that tests showed he had prostate cancer, or with Sunday's statement by a former congressman, Joseph J. DioGuardi, that he intended to pursue the Conservative nomination.</p>
        <p>Still, the mayor's announcement on Monday that he, too, planned to pursue the nomination, and his statement today that he would meet with Mr. Long, seemed aimed at reinforcing the impression that his is a vigorous, forward-looking campaign.</p>
        <p>Some Republicans complained that the comments by Mr. Pataki, whose relationship with the mayor has been strained, would undercut that impression. Mr. Giuliani has said that until he decides on a course of treatment over the next few weeks, he cannot say definitively whether he will stay in the race.</p>
        <p>The governor was asked this morning at a news conference here whether he thought he might run for Senate after all, given the mayor's ill health. ''I believe that Mayor Giuliani's going to run,'' he said, adding, ''I'm not going to speculate.''</p>
        <p>He was asked three times if that meant he was ruling out a campaign, but did not answer directly.</p>
        <p>''I am very strongly supportive of the mayor, and I'm hopeful that the mayor will make the decision to stay in the race,'' he said. ''I don't believe that he will find that there's any impediment to his candidacy.''</p>
        <p>The last time around, he said: ''I love being governor. I want to stay as governor. But I'm not going to speculate as to what may or may not happen.''</p>
        <p>The governor was clearly in a tight spot.  Saying he might run, no matter how many ways he qualified it, would have drawn even more attention from the mayor, and would have been viewed by many Republicans as sabotage. Ruling out a campaign would appear to foreclose his options, something he is apparently unwilling to do.</p>
        <p>Asked later why Mr. Pataki did not just say no, he would not run -- and, while he was at it, scold reporters for asking inappropriate questions -- Zenia Mucha, his chief political adviser, said: ''He doesn't rule in or out anything. It's not in his nature.''</p>
