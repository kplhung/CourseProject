        <p>I HAVE nothing against foie gras. In fact, I love it. Yet the sight of foie gras, once a relatively rare delicacy, proliferating on the menus of corner restaurants in some of the most unlikely neighborhoods strikes me as overkill. Far be it from me to deprive anybody of a slice of fattened liver, but the spread of foie gras seems both a triumph of pretension over modesty and a sign of the increasing homogenization of neighborhoods and restaurants.</p>
        <p>So, I am happy to report that Max, a tiny Italian restaurant wholly without pretensions, is packed nightly in an area of the East Village where foie gras sightings have become increasingly common. Max's draw is exactly what has always attracted people to neighborhood restaurants: well-prepared food, served with warmth. Best of all, Max is cheap, with only one appetizer approaching $9 and one main course nearing $15.</p>

        <p>I HAVE nothing against foie gras. In fact, I love it. Yet the sight of foie gras, once a relatively rare delicacy, proliferating on the menus of corner restaurants in some of the most unlikely neighborhoods strikes me as overkill. Far be it from me to deprive anybody of a slice of fattened liver, but the spread of foie gras seems both a triumph of pretension over modesty and a sign of the increasing homogenization of neighborhoods and restaurants.</p>
        <p>So, I am happy to report that Max, a tiny Italian restaurant wholly without pretensions, is packed nightly in an area of the East Village where foie gras sightings have become increasingly common. Max's draw is exactly what has always attracted people to neighborhood restaurants: well-prepared food, served with warmth. Best of all, Max is cheap, with only one appetizer approaching $9 and one main course nearing $15.</p>
        <p>Max is owned by Massimo Fortunato, Luigi Iasilli and Antonio Lo Brutto, who met 25 years ago when their families were vacationing in southern Italy. They have worked in several New York restaurants, most recently Frank on Second Avenue, which Max resembles. Yet the food at Max is simpler, the service friendlier and the decor of mismatched chairs and plastic-covered tabletops even more modest.</p>
        <p>Max's buffalo-milk mozzarella is an excellent place to start. The cheese is fresh, nutty and slightly salty, and a perfect partner for prosciutto ($8.95). It is also fine in the insalata Caprese ($6.95), the familiar offering of mozzarella, tomato and basil. Fennel shows up in both a refreshing salad ($5.95) sweetened with balsamic vinegar, and on a plate of tasty grilled vegetables ($5.95), with roasted peppers and zucchini.</p>
        <p>Incidentally, now that I've praised Max's low prices and lack of pretension, I must say that I would willingly pay a little more for freshly grated Parmesan instead of the pallid powder Max uses.</p>
        <p>For the most part, I've very much enjoyed Max's pastas. Fettuccine al sugo Toscano ($8.95) has a wonderfully mellow meat sauce with layers of flavor that unfold in the mouth, while rigatoni Napoletano ($8.95) is served southern Italian style, with meatballs and sausages left intact in the sauce.</p>
        <p>I loved a special nutty black linguine with shrimp in a spicy tomato sauce ($12.95) that packed a kick. Rigatoni alla Siciliana ($8.95), a blend of eggplant, mozzarella, basil and sweetened tomato sauce, worked well, the sweetness of the grilled vegetable showing up nicely against the sauce. But in another dish, spaghetti with lamb ragu ($8.95), the sweetness of the tomato sauce was too dominant.</p>
        <p>Too-sweet tomato sauce also shows up with meatloaf Neapolitan style ($10.95). Order the sauce on the side, because the meatloaf is fascinating, stuffed with mozzarella, hard-boiled egg and prosciutto, making for a savory, moist and delicious combination.</p>
        <p>The most expensive dish on the menu, osso buco ($14.95), was nonetheless a good value; the veal shank was tender enough and came with a zesty lemony topping, but the meat was a tad underseasoned. Still, it came perched atop a mound of fine risotto, creamy but with a perfect bit of resistance in the grains, subtly flavored with saffron.</p>
        <p>Rack of lamb ($14), marinated in olive oil and rosemary, was likewise tender but more forcefully seasoned than the veal.</p>
        <p>Max has a brief list of wines under $25 and, oddly given the food prices, a broader selection for $25 to $40.</p>
        <p>Desserts (all $5) include a good tiramisu and an excellent caramel panna cotta. Also, Max serves a fine creme brulee. Why are three young men from southern Italy serving creme brulee? It may be their one false step, but at least it's a good one.</p>
