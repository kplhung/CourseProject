        <p>For decades on television shows about teenagers, sex was unmentioned, divorced parents were out of the question, and families lived in an all-white suburban world that seemed frozen in time. The biggest issues facing television teenagers of the 50's, 60's and 70's seemed to be borrowing the family car or finding a date for the prom.</p>
        <p>Then came the Fox shows ''Beverly Hills 90210,'' which is reaching its television finale on May 17 after 10 years, and ''Party of Five,'' whose last episode will be seen tonight at 8.</p>
        <p>Though the characters on these two series could not be more dissimilar, ''Beverly Hills 90210'' and ''Party of Five'' have transformed the way teenagers are depicted on television, presenting them as far more complicated, thoughtful and sexy than the innocent, perky and sometimes goofy young people on earlier series like ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis,'' ''The Patty Duke Show,'' ''My Three Sons'' and ''The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.''</p>
        <p>''Beverly Hills 90210,'' the longest-running drama series on American television and nothing less than a cultural phenomenon abroad, enjoyed far greater success than ''Party of Five.'' ''90210'' was initially about a Minnesota family, Jim and Cindy Walsh and their twin teenagers, Brenda (Shannon Doherty) and Brandon (Jason Priestley), who move to opulent Beverly Hills. At fictional West Beverly Hills High (patterned after Beverly Hills High School and some private schools in Los Angeles) the twins encounter a sun-bleached world of money, glamour and, even by Southern California standards, unreasonably perfect looks and bodies.</p>
        <p>The show itself was never taken seriously by critics or even rival television executives; in fact it was scorned as shallow. In his review of the ''90210'' premiere in The Washington Post, Tom Shales wrote of the show's makers: ''They've created a vacuum, a perfect void, a black hole in the already vast and empty TV schedule. Not so much a black hole actually as a beige one.''</p>
        <p>But despite the obvious fantasy elements of the high school, the series dealt, in its own glossy way, with subjects as serious as date rape, alcoholism, suicide, AIDS and drug abuse. Thus the series stood out from contemporaries like ''Ferris Bueller'' and ''Parker Lewis Can't Lose.''</p>
        <p>''Party of Five,'' which made its debut in 1994, was about five siblings raising themselves after the deaths of their parents at the hands of a drunken driver.</p>
        <p>Ron Simon, the curator at the Museum of Television and Radio in Manhattan, said that what was especially novel about ''90210'' and ''Party of Five'' was their focus on the teenagers outside the standard family context. Previous shows were characterized by major story lines involving parents because networks and advertisers wanted to draw on as large a demographic group as possible.</p>
        <p>But the splintering of the television audience, the growth of cable and the end of the dominance of the once-powerful three major networks led advertisers and networks to target a specific segment of the audience: in this case, teenagers themselves.</p>
        <p>''In the past the comic struggles of the teenagers on television were always in the context of the family,'' said Mr. Simon. ''They didn't reflect the hidden truths and confusions of what it meant to be a teenager. These shows tried to reflect that.''</p>
        <p>The striking success of ''90210'' fostered the creation of the WB network, which was marketed specifically for the kinds of teenage audiences generated by ''90210'' and ''Party of Five.'' (Movies, on the other hand, have often dealt with teenagers in a more straightforward way; 45 years ago the Nicholas Ray film ''Rebel With a Cause,'' which made James Dean a star, served as one of the earliest and most serious depictions of alienated teenagers.)</p>
        <p>''Our show opened the way on television,'' said Chris Keyser, who created ''Party of Five'' with his partner Amy Lippman. ''It was really the first of its kind to specifically deal with serious relationships among teenagers and those in their early 20's.''</p>
        <p>'' 'Party of Five' said to network executives and advertisers that there's an important demographic in teenagers, and shows about them can be successful,'' Mr. Keyser said. ''It's fair to say that the show, as well as a show like 'My So-Called Life,' treated teenagers and those in their early 20's as something beyond just soap opera.''</p>
        <p>Aaron Spelling, one of the executive producers of ''90210,'' whose extraordinarily successful career has been stamped by shows like ''Charlie's Angels'' and ''Dynasty,'' said that for all the critical abuse the show took, its success was based on several factors: as the cast grew older and went on to college, the audience grew older, too, and kept returning; the show never preached or seemed strident as it dealt with serious issues in a setting that seemed quite unserious; and it was  dreamlike in its lush surroundings and gorgeous people.</p>
        <p>''The intent changed,'' said Mr. Spelling. ''In the beginning it was just to have fun with kids in high school. You know, cheerleaders and football games and pom-poms and all that. We hung on by our teeth.''</p>
        <p>But then Fox, in an unusual move in the summer of 1991, decided to broadcast new episodes instead of reruns. They dealt with summer vacations and playing at the beach, which gave the young cast members the chance to take off their clothes and stroll around in bathing suits. The episodes turned Mr. Priestley and Luke Perry into television stars and lured a large audience of young women to the show.</p>
        <p>After that ''90201'' began tackling what were then unusual subjects for a seemingly frivolous teenager series. ''We had shows about racism, we had shows about condom use, we had a show about a kid accidentally killed by his father's gun left in a drawer,'' said Mr. Spelling. ''We had shows about violence at school. Remember this was years ago.''</p>
        <p>Charles Rosin, an executive producer of the series in its first five years, said these breakthroughs went unnoticed by critics. ''We broke ground on many different levels,'' he said. ''Our lead characters were sexual. In our ninth episode we dealt with AIDS. They were computer-literate as far back as 1993. We would scour what was going on in the culture.</p>
        <p>''Sure, there was style and facade. But underneath we dealt with a whole jangle of anxieties and insecurities back then which we take for granted today. We took teenagers seriously, their melodramas and relationships and problems. Television shows back then didn't do that, except for heavy after-school specials which dealt with the problem of the week.''</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, ''Party of Five'' was developed as a replacement for ''90210,'' which was then in its fourth year. Mr. Keyser and Ms. Lippman, who had met years before in a writing class at Harvard, said that the idea for ''Party of Five'' came from Sandy Grushow, now chairman of the Fox Television Entertainment Group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grushow, then a high-ranking Fox television executive, said he was concerned about how long the Beverly Hills show would last. He said he and several other executives discussed a series about teenage empowerment and struck on the idea of a family of teenagers who lost their parents in an accident. Mr. Keyser and Mr. Lippman turned the show into one that was more serious than Fox intended.</p>
        <p>'' '90210' was initially a straight-down-the middle soap opera, whereas 'Party of Five' was conceived by Chris and Amy to be a more serious contemporary drama,'' said Mr. Grushow. ''I probably conceived it somewhere in the middle.''</p>
        <p>At least at the outset the two shows would have been unthinkable on ABC, CBS and NBC. ''The idea that any of those three networks would do a show about teenagers and for teenagers was absurd,'' said Mr. Grushow.</p>
        <p>''Party of Five,'' was never in the same ratings league as ''90210.'' But because it followed the Beverly Hills show on Wednesday nights on Fox, the more somber show was buoyed by the success of ''90210.'' Still, ''Party of Five'' was never among television's Top 20 shows, and its situation has been dicey over the last few years.</p>
        <p>Recently Fox moved the show to Tuesday nights at 9, against NBC's ''Will and Grace'' and ABC's ''Dharma and Greg.'' Some of the stars of ''Party of Five'' had either left or were reducing their number of episodes. More important, most of the show's characters were now young adults. As a result Fox decided to end the show.</p>
        <p>Certainly the two teen-age dramas faded because their stars had grown older, and the longevity of the two series, especially ''90210,'' may have made them a little tired. At the same time the growth of cable networks like MTV, VHI and E! and the appeal of the Internet have splintered the teenage audience.</p>
        <p>But these shows' impact remains considerable. WB's ''Dawson's Creek,'' ''Felicity,'' ''Popular,'' ''Angel'' and ''Roswell,'' and even NBC's acclaimed but canceled high school comedy, ''Freaks and Geeks,'' owe a debt to the two Fox series that took teenagers and their issues seriously.</p>
        <p>Though many of those connected with ''90210'' and ''Party of Five'' say the series gave them a career boost, some writers and actors said they were concerned that the shows had typecast them, and that they were seeking to reach beyond the teenage genre.</p>
        <p>Scott Wolf, one of the stars of ''Party,'' was on Broadway last year in ''Side Man.'' He has recently worked at several repertory theaters and is actively pursuing a film career.</p>
        <p>Before the series, ''I was sort of bopping around, getting work in commercials, doing whatever I could get my hands on,'' said Mr. Wolf, 31. ''This has radically changed my life.'' He said he was convinced that the show succeeded because it was so different from conventional television series about teenagers.</p>
        <p>Similarly Ian Ziering, a star of ''90210,'' said that no matter how glamorous or even unreal the characters on the show seemed at times, audiences related to the series because there was an underpinning of seriousness.</p>
        <p>''If it was only a show about hair styles, it would not have survived,'' Mr. Ziering said. ''It was a show about young people growing up together, living with the cards that life dealt them. And a lot of people, young and not so young, related to that.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 8, 2000, Monday  An article in the arts pages on Wednesday about the history of television shows focusing on teenagers misspelled the given name of the actress who played Brenda on ''90210.'' She is Shannen Doherty, not Shannon.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated the title of the 1955 film that made James Dean a star. It is ''Rebel Without a Cause,'' not ''Rebel With a Cause.''</p>
