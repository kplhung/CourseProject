        <p>As the Clinton administration seeks a tenfold increase in money for Russian-American biological cooperation, the General Accounting Office has concluded that American support could inadvertently help Russian scientists and former weapons labs make germ weapons.</p>
        <p>In a new report, the G.A.O. presents no evidence that Moscow is conducting such illegal research or making germ weapons. Nor does the report state that American assistance to Russian labs and scientists is being diverted for military purposes. But Congress's auditing agency said that despite the administration's efforts to reduce the risks of such misuse or diversion, there is no way to prevent Russian scientists from ''potentially using their skills or research outputs to later work on offensive weapons activities at any of the Russian military institutes that remain closed to the United States.''</p>
        <p>The report, which was obtained by The New York Times before its publication later this week, says such concerns have been intensified by Russia's unwillingness to open four vital military labs to inspection or visits by foreign scientists. It chides Moscow for retaining in senior posts the ''cold war leadership'' of the germ-weapons complex, like Gen. Yuri T. Kalinin, who heads Biopreparat, an organization that directed the Soviet germ warfare program.</p>
        <p>In a written response to the G.A.O.'s concerns, the administration argued that the risks of not helping 15,000 impoverished Russian germ-weapons scientists and technicians at about 50 institutes throughout the former Soviet Union far outweigh the risks of doing so. Scientists desperate for employment would likely find work with rogue states like Iran, the administration argued.</p>
        <p>''We can stay home and wish the problem away, or we can confront it head on at the source,'' an administration official said.</p>
        <p>Privately, officials cite what they call quiet breakthroughs in scientific cooperation with the Russians that have enhanced their confidence that Moscow is getting out of the germ-weapons business. For instance, a team of Russian scientists that once made a deadly strain of anthrax last week gave their American counterparts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta two rare anthrax strains as part of a long-awaited exchange program.</p>
        <p>Administration officials also cite some progress in efforts to open up Russia's closed military germ labs. A group of Russian military scientists has agreed to visit American chemical-biological defense facilities this summer as part of another exchange program, officials disclosed.</p>
        <p>The G.A.O. report is likely to help fuel a long-simmering debate over whether Russia is still making germ weapons or conducting illegal research and development as the Soviet Union did after signing a treaty that banned germ weapons. Former President Boris N. Yeltsin declared in 1992 that Russia had ended its germ warfare program and told Washington he would dismiss General Kalinin, a former intelligence officer. But Biopreparat, which has been reborn as a state-owned drug company, still controls many Russian institutes, though it no longer finances them, and it is still headed by General Kalinin. Russian officials and the general have denied that Russia is making germ weapons or conducting illegal research.</p>
        <p>To help prevent the spread of deadly scientific knowledge and germ-weapons expertise from Russia to Iran, Iraq and other potentially dangerous states, the administration has provided about $20 million between the fiscal years 1994 and 1999 to support collaborative research projects in Russia that redirect former germ-weapons scientists to peaceful research activities.</p>
        <p>Between the fiscal years 2000 and 2004, the administration plans to spend at least $220 million to expand efforts to engage former Soviet germ weapons institutes.</p>
        <p>Representative Floyd D. Spence, the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said today that the G.A.O. report ''reinforces my concern that the administration's plans to increase assistance to Russia could exacerbate the risk of a renewed Russian offensive biological weapons effort.''</p>
        <p>Several experts disagreed. Amy E. Smithson, a defense expert at the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington who toured some of the six labs that the G.A.O. team visited, said the report itself contained considerable evidence that the administration's program was effective.</p>
        <p>She noted that the report discloses that American support has prompted former Soviet scientists at about 15 labs to reject an offer to cooperate with states like Iran. ''The American auditing of its grants is usually very tight,'' Dr. Smithson said. ''If the State Department finds evidence that a scientist has gone astray, the institute loses its grant. Whenever the U.S. has placed that choice before a Russian scientist or lab, the answer is always: 'We're on your team.' ''</p>
