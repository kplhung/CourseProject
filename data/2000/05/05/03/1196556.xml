      <block class="full_text">
        <p>It was an unwieldy and not altogether happy reunion of a very unusual class, the so-called Willowbrook Class.</p>
        <p>Twenty-five years after the patients of the infamous Willowbrook State School won a class-action lawsuit that led to the widespread deinstitutionalization of the mentally retarded, lawyers, doctors, administrators and some class members themselves gathered to celebrate the settlement, called the Willowbrook Consent Judgment -- and to criticize its aftermath.</p>
        <p>In the 1960's and early 70's, the conditions at Willowbrook, including feces-smeared walls, naked inhabitants and frequent, violent deaths, were well documented, most notably by Geraldo Rivera, whose 1972 television expose was the impetus for a federal lawsuit.</p>
        <p>In 1975, Gov. Hugh L. Carey signed the consent decree, thus committing the state to establish noninstitutional homes for people with developmental disabilities. Governor Carey, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, and Gov. George E. Pataki were all honored yesterday.</p>
        <p>The conference, held on the campus of the College of Staten Island, where the crowded, prisonlike wards of Willowbrook once stood, was called ''Social Justice Has Prevailed.''</p>
        <p>But many of the 450 present said it had not: There are still mentally retarded people institutionalized;  care still needs improvement, even in group homes; the state is not meeting the promises it made in the settlement, and no reparations, or even apologies, have been made.</p>
        <p>The participants acknowledged  that the decree had succeeded, to a degree. Only 8 of the state's 20 mental institutions remain, and the number of people in such institutions has decreased to fewer than 1,000 from 25,000, according to the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, which was created after the consent decree.</p>
        <p>The decree is considered to be one of the most successful social policy changes of its type, especially when compared with the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill, in which  services for those affected have lagged.</p>
        <p>But lawyers who represent the 3,600 remaining members of the Willowbrook Class said the case was  technically still open, and that they often had to threaten to get an injunction to ensure that the state met its agreements.</p>
        <p>''It's sort of a continuous game of chicken,'' said Beth Haroulas of the New York Civil Liberties Union, adding that she still saw reports of abuse, neglect and inadequate medical care in group homes.</p>
        <p>And, she said, Willowbrook Class members are better off than other mentally retarded people. Their case managers have lighter loads -- 20 as opposed to 30 -- and the quality of their care is more closely monitored.</p>
        <p>Many of the conference panelists made a point of saying there was room for improvement.</p>
        <p>One with a particularly dramatic story to tell was Bernard Carabello, who entered Willowbrook when he was 3, and stayed for 18 years, even though he was not retarded. Mr. Carabello has cerebral palsy, which does not impair mental functioning.</p>
        <p>Now a governor-appointed advocate for the developmentally disabled, Mr. Carabello said the main problems in the field today involved community relations: neighborhoods often do not welcome group homes and those who live in them are often isolated from their communities.</p>
        <p>During question-and-answer sessions, parents of school-age mentally retarded children said they, too, felt isolated. Without the rallying point of Willowbrook, one mother said, they lacked unity, especially since the group homes spread their children throughout the state.</p>
        <p>''I feel like you hand the responsibility over to me as a parent, yet no one has ever backed me up along the way,'' one mother said.</p>
        <p>Present problems aside, the gathering was, for some, an emotional trip to the past.</p>
        <p>Several of the participants, including William Bronston, one of the Willowbrook doctors who helped organize the parents who filed the lawsuit,  returned to the site for the first time since the 70's.</p>
        <p>During one panel discussion, he called for an apology to be issued to those who suffered.</p>
        <p>''The parents,'' Dr. Bronston said privately during a lunchtime presentation of awards and speeches, ''have never been acknowledged as Holocaust survivors, American-style.''</p>
        <p>As Jose Rivera took the podium to remember his brother, who died while staying at Willowbrook, the faces of many parents and siblings grew quiet and drawn. Some of them had lost relatives. Others said they were lucky.</p>
        <p>Ann Nehbauer of Hastings, N.Y., whose son now lives in a group home in nearby Scarsdale, told how she would make unannounced visits to Willowbrook, where he was one of 90 children in a ward with barely 12 inches of space between beds.</p>
        <p>Though she knew what the conditions were, she said, ''Our only option was no option.''</p>
        <p>Diana McCourt, the wife of the writer Malachy McCourt, said her daughter, Nina Galin, now lived in a group home in Harlem, where she participated in a new one-on-one program that allowed her to venture accompanied into the city.</p>
        <p>She remembered finding out what Willowbrook was like: ''I felt totally enraged, totally terrified and also totally determined to find like-minded people. I looked around to find the most radical social worker by length of hair, and it worked.''</p>
        <p>Though conditions have improved, Mrs. McCourt allowed, she bristled at honoring the former governors for their work.</p>
        <p>''They were doing what they were paid to do,'' she said.</p>
        <p>And she agreed with Dr. Bronston's call for an apology.</p>
        <p>''I feel it's what establishes a human relationship between people who provide services and those who receive them,'' Mrs. McCourt said.</p>
