        <p>On the Internet, brokerage firms are starting to use stock trades the way banks used to use pens and lollipops: they are giving them away to lure people onto their Web sites.</p>
        <p>The latest concern to forgo commissions on online purchases of stock is the Financial Cafe.com, a start-up based in Seattle. Despite being quite late to the electronic-brokerage party that broke out a few years ago, Financial Cafe.com hopes to attract customers to its other financial services by giving away trades ordered at market prices.</p>
        <p>The venture is at least the third to offer free stock trades. Last week, the Ameritrade Holding Corporation, an established online brokerage firm, introduced Freetrade.com, an all-electronic trading service. Late last year, American Express started giving away trades to certain investors. Those offers undercut the deep discount brokers, including Ameritrade's flagship service and FleetBoston Financial's SureTrade unit, that charge about $8 a trade.</p>
        <p>''Putting that zero out there gets people's attention,'' said Alex Stein, an executive vice president of Gomez Advisors in Boston and an adviser to Financial Cafe.com. ''Once you get their attention, the key is to offer a high-quality service to retain the customers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stein said the number of brokerage accounts at American Express rose sharply after it introduced free trades for customers with at least $25,000 in their accounts. The offer was so successful, it seemed to overwhelm the company's systems, said Mr. Stein, whose company tracks the responsiveness of e-commerce operations.</p>
        <p>''We've seen their customer service go from stellar to one of the worst, largely because they saw this fantastic influx of new accounts,'' Mr. Stein said.</p>
        <p>Officials of Financial Cafe.com said they planned to emphasize service by having a higher ratio of service representatives to customers than established firms have. The industry average is about one representative for every 1,200 to 1,500 accounts, Mr. Stein said, and Financial Cafe.com plans to have about three representative to serve that many accounts.</p>
        <p>Robert M. D. Cross, chairman of Financial Cafe.com and former chief executive of Yorkton Securities, a Canadian investment bank, said the new venture would charge competitive rates for a range of financial products, including bonds and mutual funds, and loans against stocks.</p>
        <p>Andrew Koslow, the company's chief operating officer, insisted that it would not treat no-cost stock trades as a loss leader. With the deals the company has struck with its business partners, Mr. Koslow said, it will need only a small number of accounts to become profitable.</p>
        <p>The most important alliance is with FreeShop.com, a Web site that collects information about discounts and free trial offers from a variety of merchants. In exchange for an undisclosed amount of equity in Financial Cafe.com, FreeShop.com plans to promote the new venture to its list of more than three million customers.</p>
        <p>''All of our customers are online transactors and a majority of them have made purchases online,'' said Tim Choate, chairman and chief executive of FreeShop.com, which is also based in Seattle. They are obviously attracted by free offers, but Mr. Choate said he did not know how many of them already had accounts with online brokerage firms.</p>
        <p>For three months, FreeShop.com will be the exclusive promoter of Financial Cafe.com. Mr. Choate said the arrangement was the first of what his company hoped would be a series of ''jump starts'' that it would provide for nascent e-commerce companies. With the stock of his company, which went public last year, now trading below its initial offering price, Mr. Choate said the company's most valuable asset was its status as one of the most heavily visited sites on the Web.</p>
        <p>Michele Pelino, an analyst with the Yankee Group in Boston, said there was a potential liability in drawing customers with an offer that seems to good to be true.</p>
        <p>''Offering free stock trades will draw traffic, but is it the traffic that you want?'' Ms. Pelino asked. ''When you say something's free, consumers tend to think you get what you pay for. That can actually be a challenge in a way.''</p>
        <p>After talking with officials of Financial Cafe.com, Ms. Pelino said it was not clear to her how the company could avoid losing money on each free trade.</p>
