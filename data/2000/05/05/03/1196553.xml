        <p>In a highly critical report, a commission investigating the fatal collapse of a traditional Texas A&amp;M University bonfire tower concluded today that students made fundamental mistakes in building the huge structure and that university officials failed to control the student-led project properly.</p>
        <p>The accident on Nov. 18 killed 11 students and a former student and injured 27 others. The five-member commission said that construction flaws and a sloped surface caused the lowest tier of logs to break and set off the collapse of the 59-foot  structure. Yet, in assessing responsibility, the commission pointed not to current students and administrators but to an insular university culture  that for years had resisted change and discouraged criticism.</p>
        <p>''This failure has roots in decisions and actions by both students and university officials over many, many years,'' said the commission chairman, Leo Linbeck Jr., a Houston construction executive. ''It created an environment where a complex and dangerous structure was allowed to be built without controls.''</p>
        <p>For A&amp;M, known for the intense devotion and loyalty of students and alumni, the accident has prompted much soul-searching over whether to continue the 90-year-tradition of the bonfire. Every year, students spend two months harvesting thousands of trees and erecting the tower that is set afire on the eve of the school's annual football game with its archrival, the University of Texas.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ray M. Bowen, the university president, said he would decide the fate of the tradition within six weeks after reviewing the commission's two-inch thick report and consulting with student leaders, faculty members, university officials and alumni. In recent weeks, more than 6,000 students have signed petitions in favor of continuing the tradition, known on campus simply as Bonfire.  About 3,000 people, mostly students, attended today's final meeting at the school's basketball arena.</p>
        <p>''I have not made up my mind,'' Dr. Bowen said at a news conference after the commission meeting. ''It may be that we will continue to have a bonfire, it may be that we will not.''</p>
        <p>Created immediately after the accident, the commission hired several consulting firms to study the engineering design and the organizational culture of the project.</p>
        <p>For months, speculation had swirled about the accident. News accounts and documents released by the university revealed that students had failed in several instances to follow a safety handbook. The tower exceeded the allowed 55-foot height. Freshmen and sophomores, who were considered inexperienced, were  working on the structure's top levels despite safety guidelines that prohibited them from doing so. A crane operated by a student had struck the tower. The guiding pole had snapped at least three times. And toxicology reports indicated that two of the 12 victims were legally drunk.</p>
        <p>The commission did find evidence of drinking, horseplay and hazing but said none of those activities contributed to the collapse. The commission  minimized the impact of the crane incident and the actions of the students atop the stack, and it ruled out sabotage.</p>
        <p>The bonfire is a student-run activity with a faculty adviser and a university committee, neither of which monitor the structure's design.</p>
        <p>Veronica Callaghan, a commission member, described a loose atmosphere in which the tower was built ''with no written guidelines.'' Upperclassmen known as ''red pots'' and ''brown pots'' are expected to train the thousands of students who take part, but Ms. Callaghan said student leaders lacked the proper knowledge to safely construct the tower.</p>
        <p>The ''bonfire was never built the same way twice,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Callaghan also blamed university officials, saying A&amp;M ''addresses risk in student organizations reactively.'' She said there were warning signs: the tower collapsed in 1957 and in 1990, though no one was injured. Injuries related to the bonfire had risen to 59 in 1998 from 32 in 1996. Yet, she said university officials had ''tunnel vision,'' failing to recognize that such accidents could indicate structural and cultural problems. Other universities, she said, are more aggressive in monitoring student activities.</p>
        <p>In explaining the physical cause of the collapse, Hugh Robinson, a commission member who runs a Dallas engineering firm, noted that the tower had evolved over many decades from a pile of trash to a complicated engineering project that weighed more than two million pounds. Despite this evolution, Mr. Robinson noted that university officials took a  limited role in the project.</p>
        <p>After an exhaustive engineering review, the commission traced the problem to the lowest tier of the  tower, which was shaped like a wedding cake, Mr. Robinson said. Since 1994, students had wrapped steel cables around this lowest tier, or stack, of upright logs for extra support, he said. He compared the cables to the strips of metal around a wooden barrel. But last year, students did not use the cables, partly because they believed that the cables made the wooden stack burn faster.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson said students also improperly wedged the second tier of logs into this lowest tier. Students thought doing so would provide more stability and create a tighter foundation, but Mr. Robinson said the opposite occurred: the pressure from the wedged logs helped push the lower tier apart, particularly since the steel support cables were absent. Finally, a sloped ground surface contributed to the instability, as did the excessive size of the second tier.</p>
        <p>''A combination of factors and not any one factor led to the collapse,'' Mr. Robinson said. Still, he noted that using the cables ''would have greatly reduced the likelihood of collapse.'' The snapping of the structure's center pole, however, did not contribute to the collapse, he said.</p>
        <p>In his news conference, Dr. Bowen said his heart told him to carry on the bonfire tradition. But he quickly added that he would make his decision with his head.</p>
        <p>''If we do continue to have Bonfire,'' he said, ''there will be appropriate changes to the culture. That's essential.''</p>
        <p>Wade Countryman, 22, a senior who is a member of A&amp;M's military Corps of Cadets, attended the commission's presentation. ''I think we'll have it next year,'' he said. ''I think it will change, but I think it was an accident. I don't know how much you could prevent it. Accidents happen.''</p>
