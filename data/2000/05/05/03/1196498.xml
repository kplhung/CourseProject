        <p>Jeremy Mayfield and his team were penalized yesterday by Nascar officials, receiving suspensions, fines and a loss of points for using illegal fuel in a Winston Cup Series race in Talladega, Ala., two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>The tough penalties, which included the second-largest fine in Nascar  history, came two days after Mayfield won the biggest race of his career in the NAPA Auto Parts 500 in Fontana, Calif.</p>
        <p>Mayfield, who drives a Ford Taurus, had 151 driver points taken away, dropping him from 7th place to 14th in the Winston Cup standing.</p>
        <p>Michael Kranefuss, who operates the team that he owns with Roger Penske, was fined $50,000. He and the crew chief, Peter Sospenzo, were suspended until June 6, or for three races.</p>
        <p>Mike Helton, Nascar's chief operating officer, announced the penalties from the association's Daytona Beach, Fla., headquarters.</p>
        <p>''Through a routine postrace fuel sampling, we found a foreign substance in the fuel of the No. 12 car following the race at Talladega,'' he said in a statement. ''We took several fuel samples, and the sample from the No. 12 car read considerably different than the sample that was taken from our fuel source on site.''</p>
        <p>An improper additive -- an oxygen enhancer that boosts horsepower -- was discovered in the fuel tank of Mayfield's car, Nascar officials said.</p>
        <p>Both Mayfield and Kranefuss issued apologetic statements from their headquarters in Mooresville, N.C.</p>
        <p>''We're all embarrassed, and we're all going to make sure nothing like this happens again,'' Mayfield said. ''There were some things that were done wrong. But we're going to work to get back to where we were before.''</p>
        <p>Kranefuss said that disciplinary action has been taken within the team and he apologized to the team's fans, sponsors and competitors.</p>
        <p>''Mistakes were made and there were certainly some errors in judgment,'' he said. ''People make mistakes, but we have to move forward.''</p>
        <p>Kranefuss said the additive had been put in the gas tank by an unidentified crew member.</p>
        <p>Mayfield was unaware of what the crew member had done, Nascar officials said.</p>
        <p>Dodge on Schedule</p>
        <p>The clock behind Ray Evernham,  as he spoke yesterday at the Homestead (Fla.) Motor Speedway, read 292 days and counting. That is when Dodge will return to Winston Cup Series racing next year after an absence of 22 years.</p>
        <p>Dodge took a significant step forward yesterday when it conducted its first on-track test. An eager Kyle Petty flew in for the occasion, and he drove a gray car with orange lettering. The test was called a momentum builder by Evernham, the former crew chief for Jeff Gordon; Evernham was hired away to start Dodge's program.</p>
        <p>No cooling problems, Evernham said afterward. And all the systems and special tools worked.</p>
        <p>''What we accomplished mainly is that now we know we can start to test seriously because our systems work,'' Evernham said. ''Are we going to win 10 races the first year? I think that would be unrealistic. If we can get the cars running in the top 10 early in the year and then be challenging for wins at the end, I think that's competitive.''</p>
