        <p>When they opened a charter school in a deserted warehouse here, Michael and Sarah Rennick had a clear vision of what it could be: a place where kids who did not fit the mold -- the geeks, the dropouts -- would flourish, a place where students might start their days later to accommodate their teenage sleepiness, a place where they would call teachers by their first names, and skateboard or play paintball in lieu of gym class.</p>
        <p>The Regional Experiential Academic Charter High School, also known as Reach, would engage these students like no other school had, giving them trust and responsibility and getting hard work and respect in return.</p>
        <p>But where the Rennicks saw potential, the state of New Jersey saw chaos. Given the freedom to learn the way they wanted, students were not learning anything at all, the state found. That was presuming students actually showed up at school, and many simply did not.</p>
        <p>The school so threatened the students' education, officials said, that they shut it down barely eight months after it opened, just more than a year after granting Reach a charter that should have allowed it to stay open for five.</p>
        <p>The closing last month left the Rennicks and parents complaining the state stifled its own experiment. The state set up the charter school law to reward innovation, but then refused to allow it, parents say. What looked disorganized was just different, and given time, they insist, the children and the school would have blossomed.</p>
        <p>''We saw the opportunity for true innovative reform,'' said Mr. Rennick, 41. ''They didn't want to hear about real reform.''</p>
        <p>The closing highlights an essential tension in the charter school movement. By definition, charter schools are alternative public schools, so they are often started by and attract parents who feel the traditional public school model is not  working for their children. Many are based on unconventional ideas of how children learn best.</p>
        <p>But as the Reach case shows, one person's alternative is another person's flaky. The case raises a host of questions. At what point does the experiment stray out of bounds, as state officials said it did here? Given that taxpayers are financing these schools, how far is the state obligated to indulge parents' ideas for innovation? And who decides whether the experiment works, and when?</p>
        <p>These questions will come up again and again in the next few years as the first round of charter schools in 32 states come up for renewal.</p>
        <p>''The states have got to think really carefully about how to allow meaningful experimentation,'' said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley. His forthcoming book ''Inside Charter Schools'' looks at six experiments across the country.</p>
        <p>''In the private sector,'' he added, ''the government has tried to regulate businesses in a way that balances allowing them to be entrepreneurial and the interests of the consumers. Whether it's health care or the airlines, or schools, we're still struggling with what that balance is.''</p>
        <p>Sarah Rennick had run a small private school near this blue-collar shore town for seven years before she and her husband decided to apply for a charter under the law New Jersey approved in 1996.</p>
        <p>They culled their ideas from reading the works of popular educators and management consultants. Taking the idea of a Harvard education professor, Howard Gardner, that students learn in a range of ''multiple intelligences'' -- some, say, spatially, others logically -- the Rennicks came up with a core group of courses, from performance arts to agribusiness, that would capitalize on each student's learning style. Students would learn through hands-on projects rather than textbooks or in a classroom where the time was rigidly divided among subjects like English or math.</p>
        <p>To measure whether the school succeeded, the founders insisted that students would have to pass the state's standardized tests -- and prove fluency in Spanish and sign language, skills they felt were necessary for a new global economy.</p>
        <p>Reach attracted 300 students in grades 9 to 11 from high schools that ranked in the bottom third statewide in standardized test scores. Most were from working-class families and spanned a range of ethnicities and races. But the school's disagreements with the state started months before any students even arrived.</p>
        <p>The first dispute was over starting times. The Rennicks, citing recent research suggesting most teenagers are not alert in class because they need more sleep than most adults, wanted to allow students to start their mornings at 9:30 instead of 8 if they chose. Anne O'Dea, director of the Office of School Choice for the New Jersey State Department of Education, told the Rennicks that staggering start times would disrupt the busing schedule.</p>
        <p>Parents describe a school that transformed monosyllabic, withdrawn teenagers into chatty students who looked forward to going to school.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't that rigid, 'Here, read these three chapters, we'll be tested on this,' '' said Deborah Roe, whose son Kyle was a freshman. ''It was something a little more unique. But they were pulling a strength from these kids. These were the quirky kids or geeky kids. This was a place where they fit in. They were blossoming.''</p>
        <p>A student, Jennifer Unger, 15, said: ''I was learning what I have never understood, because of the way the teachers taught. Instead of the teacher just standing in front of the class and talking nonsense, they actually came up to each student and talked about the assignment.''</p>
        <p>But starting the first day of school, Ms. O'Dea said she got calls from parents complaining about courses that were promised and not offered. State requirements say students have to devote a certain number of minutes to each subject, but Reach could not account for students' time, and neither could state officials who visited the school.</p>
        <p>''We had a lot of kids who were not engaged in learning,'' Ms. O'Dea said. ''There were periods during the day where the students were just in a multipurpose room, not engaged at all.''</p>
        <p>The school complained it was not getting its state money from the public schools to which students would have ordinarily been assigned, which by law are required to forward the charter schools 90 percent of the per-pupil costs for each student.</p>
        <p>But Ms. O'Dea said this was another symptom of the disorganization. In drawing up its budget, the school counted students who never enrolled at the school, but no one realized this because Reach kept such sloppy attendance records. Some students, she said, were apparently absent 40 or 50 times between September and April.</p>
        <p>Parents insist the school should have been allowed to stay open at least until the first round of statewide tests, to give it a chance to prove whose version of the school was more accurate -- the state's or the founders'.</p>
        <p>But with the disputes with the state escalating, the school's board of trustees voted out the Rennicks in February. By late last month, about 100 students had left, too, although the Rennicks say the students left pre-emptively because the state made it clear that it intended to shut the school.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Roe pulled her son out two weeks before the school closed. Her voice broke as she described how she had hoped to send her other son to Reach, as well.</p>
        <p>''This was the last-chance school for a lot of these kids,'' she said. ''I just feel like the state just really beat it up, they wanted so much conformity. They couldn't control that uniqueness of how this school wanted to educate.''</p>
