        <p>The New York State Ethics Commission has found that Gov. George E. Pataki and his aides did not violate the law in allowing a nonprofit trade group largely financed by companies lobbying his office to pay for trips he took to Hungary in 1995 and 1996.</p>

        <p>The New York State Ethics Commission has found that Gov. George E. Pataki and his aides did not violate the law in allowing a nonprofit trade group largely financed by companies lobbying his office to pay for trips he took to Hungary in 1995 and 1996.</p>
        <p>The commission concluded that the trips did raise ''ethical concerns'' because the nonprofit group, the Hungarian-American Chamber of Commerce U.S.A., raised money from the companies specifically for the trips.</p>
        <p>The commission, which is controlled by the governor's appointees, said its inquiry had determined that the governor and his aides were not aware that the group was soliciting money from the companies, which included Philip Morris, Pepsico and two pharmaceuticals giants, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb.</p>
        <p>''There is no evidence -- either from the witnesses interviewed or the documents reviewed -- that anyone in the governor's office (or elsewhere in state government) knew that H.A.C.C. was soliciting funds for the trips,'' the commission's executive director, Donald P. Berens Jr., wrote in a letter released yesterday in which it announced its findings.</p>
        <p>''Accordingly,'' the letter said, ''the commission has concluded that neither the governor nor any state officer or employee violated the state ethics law or sought to circumvent the law in connection with H.A.C.C.'s funding of the governor's trips.''</p>
        <p>In the letter, which was sent to three advocacy groups that filed a complaint about the trips, Mr. Berens noted that one of the governor's aides had asked the commission before the first trip whether the administration was required to examine the chamber's finances, and the commission had responded that it was not. Mr. Berens said that when Mr. Pataki's predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo, had accepted a trip from the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the panel had not required him to request information about that group's backers.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Berens added, the commission would change its rules to require that Mr. Pataki and his successors, when taking trips financed by outside groups, ask whether the groups are raising funds for the trips and from whom.</p>
        <p>''Where such a solicitation occurs, the potential for improper influence is heightened,'' Mr. Berens said. ''A corporation may respond to the solicitation in the hope of currying favor with the state and thereby advancing its own private interests.''</p>
        <p>During its investigation, the ethics panel learned that once Governor Pataki decided to take the first trip, his senior economic adviser, Charles A. Gargano, asked the group to pay for it. According to tax records and the commission's findings, the group had little if any money at the time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berens did not say whether Mr. Gargano asked the chamber if it could afford the trip. Right before the trip, the chamber received a total of $40,000 from the companies it solicited.</p>
        <p>The chamber, Philip Morris and some of the other companies indicated in interviews last fall that the donations to the chamber were not tied to the trips. The commission said it had determined that they were but had decided not to take action against the chamber or the companies.</p>
        <p>Under state ethics rules, companies with interests before the governor are barred from paying for his travel. In this case, the companies financed the trips, with donations of $5,000 to $20,000, by funneling the money through the chamber.</p>
        <p>The commission had allowed the chamber to pay for the trips because the chamber did not have business in Albany.</p>
        <p>Walter Ayres, a spokesman for the commission, said it believed that it would not be appropriate to penalize the chamber and companies because the commission had never explicitly banned such arrangements.</p>
        <p>Philip Morris's links to the trips helped to renew scrutiny of the company's activities in Albany, where it has long been a lobbying force. But after disclosures about its efforts to court the governor and legislators, the company suffered several defeats in the state capital.</p>
        <p>Its chief lobbyist was fined and banned for violating disclosure rules, and the state nearly doubled the cigarette tax. Last month, the Legislature completed passage of a bill over the tobacco industry's objections that would require that cigarettes be made less likely to cause fires. The bill now is before the governor.</p>
        <p>The ethics panel opened its inquiry last fall after The New York Times published several articles about the financing of the trips, which were a combination of trade mission and family vacation in the homeland of Mr. Pataki's paternal grandparents.</p>
        <p>At the time, Mr. Pataki said no one in the administration knew anything about the chamber's backers, and that the ethics rules had been strictly followed. He declined to disclose the cost of the trips and the amount the chamber paid.</p>
        <p>In response to the commission's findings, Mr. Pataki's spokesman, Michael McKeon, read a statement yesterday: ''As we have said all along, what we did was right and proper. The commission has now verified that we followed the advice and guidance that they provided us, which were the same practices used by the previous administration.''</p>
        <p>Blair Horner, legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research Group, one of the three advocacy groups that filed the complaint, said that if the administration was to be believed, it was startling that no Pataki aides had scrutinized the chamber's finances.</p>
        <p>''This shows that the administration was ethically tone deaf when this deal was first being put together,'' Mr. Horner said.</p>
        <p>The commission has five members. The governor appoints the chairman and two other members, and the state comptroller and state attorney general each appoints one. The current chairman is Paul Shechtman, a former criminal justice adviser to Mr. Pataki.</p>
        <p>When asked about the trips last fall, the chamber's president, Monika Szarka-Elling, said she did not know why Philip Morris and the other corporations contributed to the chamber, which was founded in 1992 and is based in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Executives at Philip Morris, the world's largest tobacco company, said at the time that its donations had nothing to do with the trips.</p>
        <p>Ms. Szarka-Elling did not respond to two messages at her office. Peggy Roberts, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Philip Morris said last fall that it gave $10,000 to the chamber a week before the first trip, $10,000 a few weeks before the second, and another $10,000 a year later. (In its report, the commission said the company gave $20,000 before the second trip.) A senior company executive also attended a reception in Hungary on the first trip.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berens said the panel had determined that before both trips, Ms. Szarka-Elling sent letters to Philip Morris and the other companies asking for money; the letters ''referred to H.A.C.C.'s seeking funds for the governor's proposed trip,'' Mr. Berens said.</p>
