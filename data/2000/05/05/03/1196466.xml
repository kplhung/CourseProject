      <abstract>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A May 1 editorial suggests that police officers in new democracies are often violent because there hasn't been time to train new officers in effective police methods. You also say these officers don't understand that ''their first job is to earn the trust of citizens.'' I would suggest that police violence is intended by policy to intimidate and coerce. Your recommendation that police departments have effective mechanisms for disciplining brutal officers is contradicted by the experience in large cities in old democracies -- for example, New York and Los Angeles -- where internal discipline mechanisms fail to identify and control violent behavior.</p>

        <p>I offer two alternative suggestions: the effective prosecution of police who kill, and community control of disciplinary actions for police violence.</p>
