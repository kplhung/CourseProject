        <p>Heavy Work For a Light Role</p>
        <p>The 75-year-old tenor CARLO BERGONZI is singing Verdi's ''Otello'' -- with the Opera Orchestra of New York under the direction of EVE QUELER -- for the first time in his long career tonight at Carnegie Hall, but that is not the news here. The bass PAUL PLISHKA broke five ribs last week, and has been rehearsing. But that is not the news here. The news here is the work put in by KYLE KETELSON, a 28-year-old baritone, for a one-line role, as the herald. In the beginning of Act III, he announces, ''The harbor lookout has signaled the arrival of the galley that has brought the ambassadors to Cyprus.'' Otello thanks him, and the herald walks off the stage.</p>
        <p>What was the appeal of a minuscule part? ''This was a chance to be with a living legend,'' he said, referring to Mr. Bergonzi.</p>

        <p>Heavy Work For a Light Role</p>
        <p>The 75-year-old tenor CARLO BERGONZI is singing Verdi's ''Otello'' -- with the Opera Orchestra of New York under the direction of EVE QUELER -- for the first time in his long career tonight at Carnegie Hall, but that is not the news here. The bass PAUL PLISHKA broke five ribs last week, and has been rehearsing. But that is not the news here. The news here is the work put in by KYLE KETELSON, a 28-year-old baritone, for a one-line role, as the herald. In the beginning of Act III, he announces, ''The harbor lookout has signaled the arrival of the galley that has brought the ambassadors to Cyprus.'' Otello thanks him, and the herald walks off the stage.</p>
        <p>What was the appeal of a minuscule part? ''This was a chance to be with a living legend,'' he said, referring to Mr. Bergonzi.</p>
        <p>''You hear all the old recordings, but this is a chance to be a part of history. And the stage manager told me that after the rehearsal, a couple of managers of other companies came up and said, 'Who was that? Who was that who sang that one line?' '' It was nice to get that kind of feedback, because I came here thinking I'd be anonymous.''</p>
        <p>Withdrawal Pangs Over ABC-TV</p>
        <p>For a while, Time Warner Cable subscribers had only 499 channels and nothing to watch. A day and a half in a Regis-free zone, and some people who are usually glued to the tube were a bit unglued.</p>
        <p>So before Time Warner agreed to return ABC to its cable systems yesterday, DR. ALAN MANEVITZ, a family psychiatrist at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, found himself advising patients on how to cope.</p>
        <p>He put his advice in the form of a question. After all, ''Jeopardy'' was one of the programs viewers could not see because of the blackout.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'What's the opportunity here?' '' Dr. Manevitz explained yesterday. ''What else is available to you during this quote-unquote opportunity to do with your time, from looking at other channels to going outside and exercising or spending more time with your family?</p>
        <p>''I think it's hard to totally empathize because there are so many other cable stations,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''It makes it hard to say it's as big a deal as in the days when there were only three networks. The corporations are slugging it out and the average Joe is having difficulties.''</p>
        <p>Was he having difficulty? ''I missed 'Nightline,' '' he said. ''I don't get home in time for prime time stuff.''</p>
        <p>All for Love Of Tennis, That Is</p>
        <p>DAVID N. DINKINS, the former mayor, still loves tennis so much that he flew to Nashville with DANNY GLOVER on Monday for a stunt: GOV. DON SUNDQUIST renamed Tennessee ''Tennis-E'' for one day.</p>
        <p>The temporary name change signaled the beginning of U.S.A. Tennis Month. ''I don't get paid for this,'' Mr. Dinkins said, noting that he was on the board of the United States Tennis Association.</p>
        <p>Moving Landmark</p>
        <p>It took 50 years, but Junior's has finally crossed the Brooklyn Bridge. Yesterday, Junior's, a Flatbush Avenue landmark that made its reputation on its cheesecake, opened a 60-seat restaurant in Grand Central Terminal.</p>
        <p>It was a moment that ALAN ROSEN, the 31-year-old grandson of the man who started Junior's, had been looking forward to since 1989. That was when the idea of opening a branch in Grand Central was first proposed. ''Seems like forever,'' he said. His wife, LESLIE ROSEN, a lawyer, pointed out that he had been trying to open in Grand Central longer than they had known each other (they met in 1996).</p>
        <p>''We initially wanted a bakery on the main concourse,'' Mr. Rosen said.</p>
        <p>The development company that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority hired to place stores and restaurants in Grand Central said no. Mr. Rosen remembered his reply: ''O.K., have a nice day.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, the bakery wound up where Mr. Rosen wanted it; the restaurant is on the lower level, near the Oyster Bar. Yesterday, his only headache was the cherries he had brought to work. They leaked all over the tan seats in his sport-utility vehicle, as well as his slacks.</p>
        <p>''The guy in the garage took one look and told me, 'That's not going to come out,' '' Mr. Rosen said.</p>
        <p>Never mind that it was a lunch at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel, which is in Manhattan. Or that it was a lunch for the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, which is in the Bronx. Somehow, Brooklyn became the refrain.</p>
        <p>SENATOR BARBARA BOXER, JUDGE JUDY SHEINDLIN and the philanthropist IRIS CANTOR all mentioned that they had grown up there.</p>
        <p>''These honorees are selected on their professional achievements,'' said ABE HABENSTREIT, Einstein's director of public affairs. ''We actually would have preferred it if they were all from the Bronx, since that's where we're located.''</p>
