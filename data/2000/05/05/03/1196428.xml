        <p>THERE are a number of things that we accept as natural partners for an apple tart. Vanilla ice cream is one, creme fraiche another. Even a thin scribble of wine sauce.</p>
        <p>But pancetta, Italian bacon, isn't usually one of them.</p>
        <p>Which is why it is difficult to order the apple tart at Atlas without a quiver of skepticism. In it, cubes of sauteed pancetta the size of peppercorns are embedded in a brown butter filling and cushioned beneath the softened apples. At first, there is the familiar sweetness. Then a little salt comes through to challenge it. By the second bite, there is a kind of robustness: it is those tiny flecks of pancetta.</p>
        <p>Della Gossett, the pastry chef, said she wanted to put something salty in a dessert. Apples and bacon seemed a safe combination. After all, apples and bacon turn up together in many savory dishes, and apple pie and Cheddar have shared a long history in some parts of the country.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gossett freezes the pancetta so it is easier to cut. Then she trims off the fat and cooks the bacon in the sweet, buttery juices left in the pan after the apples are caramelized. To keep it Italian, she serves the tart with toasted pine nuts and a light, airy mascarpone ice cream.</p>
        <p>The tart is daring, not outrageous, which is probably why it works. Skeptics will surely miss out on it, but those who try it will find it hard to forget.</p>
        <p>AMANDA HESSER</p>
        <p>The tart is $11 on the dinner menu at Atlas, 40 Central Park South, (212) 759-9191.</p>
