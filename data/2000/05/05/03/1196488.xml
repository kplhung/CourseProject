        <p>It doesn't take a genius to handicap this one.

        <p>It doesn't take a genius to handicap this one. The banged-up, skill-challenged, hungry Heat will starve to death against the Knicks on shots forced up as the 24-second clock winds down, on too many paint-by-number offensive possessions. On Miami's 2000 tombstone will read an inscription that could be the title of Pat Riley's next book.</p>
        <p>''Eighty Is Not Enough,'' it will say.</p>
        <p>Unless they know something in Miami we don't. Unless Tim Hardaway isn't talking about the health of his foot because he doesn't want to divulge the source of his cure. Unless Alonzo Mourning has developed a go-to move. Or unless Jamal Mashburn is finally ready to do what coaches have been after him to do since high school.</p>
        <p>''Once we were playing Tolentine, which had Adrian Autrey and Brian Reese, and Jamal was like a man on a mission,'' said Tom Murray, four decades the coach at Cardinal Hayes in the Bronx. ''He went out and got 39. But, yes, sometimes there was frustration because you wanted him to do more. Most of the time, he never had it in him to just take over.''</p>
        <p>With Mashburn in 1990, Murray won his only city title, so this was not meant as criticism, just an honest appraisal of who his former player was, and is.</p>
        <p>''That's why we won,'' Murray said, ''because he was happy to pass the ball, make the other kids better.'' And then Murray, no longer in contact with Mashburn and more of a Knick fan than a Mash man, said: ''I imagine Riley will run a lot of his offense through him as the point forward, which is what he always wanted to be.''</p>
        <p>Even with rest, even with a full week for the Knicks and Heat to sit around and feign mutual respect, Hardaway will not be more than a caretaker with 3-point range. Mourning will be Mourning, the earnest bull in the Knicks' chop shop, at times physically dominant while utterly defensible come crunch time. That leaves Mashburn as the potential arrow on Miami's growth chart.</p>
        <p>The series ''oxymoron,'' as Riley called him not long ago.</p>
        <p>He doesn't have to be Vince Carter, who wasn't Vince Carter in Round 1. Yet, if the Mashburn who has shown up in the last three New York-Miami playoff series surfaces again, the Heat will be fortunate to get a game.</p>
        <p>Mashburn has averaged 8.4 points on 34 percent shooting in 17 games, 10 below his career scoring average. Two years ago in the first round, it was an unsightly 6.2 points on 26 percent shooting. Mashburn has set unofficial records for aborted drives following promising first steps. He has seldom got inside, despite his 6-foot-8-inch, 250-pound body by Jake.</p>
        <p>He grew up near 159th Street in Manhattan, and Tom Murray can still remember his father, ''Mr. Mash,'' coming to the games. It turned out that Robert Mashburn had done some heavyweight boxing, a sport completely incongruous with his son's personality and style.</p>
        <p>''Always unselfish, the team player,'' Murray said. When he became rich, Mashburn wanted to give back to his community, so he started a summer basketball tournament for youngsters. He appreciated what was done for him during his three years with Rick Pitino at Kentucky, so he started a scholarship fund and wrote a check for $500,000.</p>
        <p>He once told a reporter that he wished he could play music, which he considered a real ''God-given talent.'' Basketball was more of a vocation, he said, ''not a real big thing.'' He said he wanted to maintain a healthy life perspective, not a great idea when your coach is Riley and the next round's opponent is New York.</p>
        <p>For this edition of the Heat, the Eastern Conference semifinals is life and death. Riley knows how much of his own reputation is riding on Mashburn. His party line is that Mashburn has never been completely healthy for these dysfunctional family reunions. He said the real Mashburn stood up in the three-game sweep of Detroit.</p>
        <p>''He's healthy and performing,'' said Riley. ''He's never been ready before.''</p>
        <p>Is he prepared to drive into the teeth of the Knicks' defense? Handle Latrell Sprewell occupying his release space on the perimeter and the double-team help when he puts the ball on the floor and Marcus Camby's long arms when Jeff Van Gundy decides to play big? Is he ready for the pushing, the holding, the Madison Square Garden heat?</p>
        <p>If health and the new rules don't help Mashburn this time around, we will punctuate the thought that he is less than the sum of his parts. ''He's a skilled player, always has been,'' Murray said. ''And I always thought it was a skill sport.''</p>
        <p>It is. Just not as much when these teams meet.</p>
