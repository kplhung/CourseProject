        <p>Instead of ladyfingers, mascarpone and espresso all blurred together in a creamy mess, the tiramisu San Dona at Via Quadronno, 25 East 73rd Street, comes broken down into its parts: crisp ladyfingers, a cup of espresso, and mascarpone and zabaglione whipped together and dusted with bitter cocoa. You dip the ladyfingers in the espresso, then in as much mascarpone as you please. You can hop ecstatically from bowl to bowl until you've perfected the proportions. Or until you're dizzy.</p>

        <p>Paolo Della Puppa, an owner of the restaurant, deconstructed his tiramisu ($12: it serves two) after he had a similar one in Italy. He then traded his method for a recipe he wanted from Revel, 24 East 81st Street, so you can share a tiramisu with a friend there, too ($10).</p>
