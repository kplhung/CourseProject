        <p>When Ayako Shima first returned to Japan after spending her secondary-school years in South America, she found herself reveling in a newfound ability to make decisions and express opinions, traits that set her apart in classrooms where no one ever seemed to volunteer to speak.</p>
        <p>But as fellow students began to shun her and it became harder to make friends, she, like many other Japanese who have lived long stretches outside their country, gradually began to perceive that the sense of freedom that had become second nature abroad could be a major handicap back home.</p>
        <p>Before long, Miss Shima, who is a 21-year-old college student in Tokyo, was biting her tongue instead of speaking out, masking the fact that she spoke two foreign languages fluently and making her speech vague with the maybes, perhapses and other hedging expressions that pepper conversational Japanese.</p>
        <p>''It is frustrating not to state my feelings, but people here call you bossy and get angry at you when you do,'' Miss Shima said. ''In Japan I've discovered that you always have to express yourself in a very careful way.''</p>
        <p>Ever since Japanese started to live in the West and travel there in large numbers in the 1970's, people have been predicting dramatic changes for one of the world's most insular societies. But in a country already famous for keeping foreigners at arm's length, returning Japanese say that the taint of other cultures is often enough for them to be regarded as somehow no longer fully Japanese.</p>
        <p>This phenomenon, while long experienced by Japanese expatriates, is perhaps the most dramatic measure of the challenge this nearly mono-ethnic nation faces as it struggles to come to terms with the pressures of globalization.</p>
        <p>In a reaction that is being called the ''U-turn phenomenon'' by sociologists, Japanese frustrated by their reception back home and are no longer willing to put up with the society's many strictures are often going back overseas as fast as possible.</p>
        <p>The problems they encounter, many say, go far beyond the simple use of language, encompassing the whole range of human relations, from the stressful rhythms of daily life and workplace politics to a mechanical educational system and affairs of the heart.</p>
        <p>Strikingly, many overseas Japanese say that the adjustment required to fit back into their society is often more traumatic than the adaptations required in moving abroad.</p>
        <p>School-age returnees, for example, say they are often taunted by their schoolmates with the term ''gaijin,'' a mildly derogatory word for foreigner. Many young people also say they feel saddened and empty by the emotional reserve that is the norm here: eye contact is rare in Japan, hugging and touching are far less common than in Western cultures, and simple gestures like smiling or holding the door for strangers are almost unheard of.</p>
        <p>Companies recruiting workers often frown on Japanese with a foreign high-school or college education as insufficiently adjusted to the ways of Japan, which emphasize outright acceptance of directives from above and group harmony.</p>
        <p>Even managers sent overseas by  their companies are routinely assigned to back-office jobs until their superiors can be sure that their foreign ways have dissipated. ''When I first returned, after eight years in the United States, my boss would tell me flatly that America had spoiled me, and kept me in a position where I would have really limited contact with customers,'' said Toyokazu Matsumoto, 51, a manager with a major Japanese corporation.</p>
        <p>''In a meeting in Japan you are not supposed to react to things quickly,'' Mr. Matsumoto said. ''I still find it difficult not to show some reaction.''</p>
        <p>Because of experiences like those, many returning adults, including Mr. Matsumoto, are sending their children to international schools in Japan, where they can escape the heavy rote learning of Japanese schools and maintain their individuality.</p>
        <p>With its population dwindling more rapidly than that of any other industrialized country, Japan has begun to debate the extent to which it will need to attract people from abroad to work here. The experiences of expatriate Japanese suggest, however, that even before it comes to terms with new immigrants, this country will first have to learn how to better accommodate its own citizens who have lived abroad.</p>
        <p>''The kind of assimilation pressure here is very strong,'' said Kazuhiro Ebuchi, a professor of cultural anthropology at the University of the Air in Tokyo. ''Even people who speak good English are teased here because Japanese should speak English in the Japanese way. Japanese people like to say that we appreciate cultural differences, but this is only lip service. In fact, there is not much place for difference here.''</p>
        <p>According to official statistics, the number of Japanese studying overseas increased nearly tenfold over 15 years, to 186,827 in 1999. From 1988 to 1998, the number of Japanese officially working overseas increased from 80,000 to 298,000.</p>
        <p>Recent opinion polls here have shown that by a substantial margin, Japanese expatriates are happier overseas than they are back home. This is particularly true for women, and especially so for those who have lived in Western countries.</p>
        <p>Some factors cited in these polls are obvious, like the more spacious homes and lower cost of living that are typical in the West. But the polls have also revealed more subtle reasons. Some cited, for example, the habit of people in Japan of identifying themselves strongly with groups, like their company or school, instead of the individualism practiced elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Women often cite the lower status of females in Japan than in many other developed countries.</p>
        <p>When Makiko Okada, who is 48, returned from the United States in the early 1960's, people like her were so unusual that she was turned away by public schools. ''It was very traumatic, because there were no other returnees around me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The sheer volume of Japanese people living overseas has reduced the oddity factor considerably since then, but in many ways Ms. Okada, who is now the director of a program for returning students at International Christian University High School in Tokyo, says the adjustments she has felt compelled to make as an adult are even more frustrating.</p>
        <p>''I was always uncomfortable with the groupism in Japan, but as I have matured, I find what bothers me most is the nonegalitarian ways of this society,'' she said. ''Japan is a much more male oriented society than the United States, although I think that is changing a bit. Still, as a female, I constantly have to tone down my views when I give an opinion, and work very hard not to intimidate my peers.''</p>
        <p>Other women told of having to remember not to smile too freely around men in the workplace, lest they take it as a sexual advance, and  to keep their voices in the high, dulcet tones still commonly adopted by working women.</p>
        <p>Chihiro Shiono, 22, a law student at Tokyo University, spent much of her childhood in England, Wales and Malaysia, returning home for brief stints before her family moved overseas again. From an early age, she said, the intense social pressures to conform grated her.</p>
        <p>''As a little girl I was teased a lot at school,'' she said. ''People called me a boy because in England I had learned to sit on the floor with my legs crossed.''</p>
        <p>To ease her adjustment when she returned to Japan briefly for secondary school, Ms. Shiono's parents  chose a school where returnees were common. But even there, when she spoke to another returnee in English in one of her first days at the school, she was bluntly warned by the girl that to do so placed her at risk of becoming an outcast. ''That really frightened me,'' Ms. Shiono said. ''I never spoke English like that again.''</p>
        <p>As she grew older, Ms. Shiono became more at ease with her international identity, but the chafing sensation of her separateness never completely faded. In junior high school, girls teased her cruelly for having boys for friends, common in England but rare for that age in Japan.</p>
        <p>Subjects like literature, where students were expected to recite the teacher's interpretations of whatever was being read rather than expressing their own views, felt odd to her. Later, entering university, she felt uncomfortable during the near compulsory college rounds of bottoms-up beer drinking.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Shiono, as for many other  Japanese who have come home, experiences like those have often made her itch to return to a life overseas. ''I don't want to remain in Japan for the rest of my life,'' she said. ''I came back to Japan to understand Japanese values, but I want to return overseas sometime soon.''</p>
