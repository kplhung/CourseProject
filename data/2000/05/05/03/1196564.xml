        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki and state legislative leaders announced an agreement today to restrict the state's much-maligned borrowing practices, clearing the way for final passage of one of the timeliest state budgets in recent years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki had refused to sign off on a final budget deal until a debt reform package was agreed on. The proposal hammered out today would for the first time impose a cap on the amount of debt that the state can carry at one time. The deal on debt limits means that the Legislature will be able to begin passing budget bills in the next few days.</p>
        <p>The debt issue is critically important to Mr. Pataki, a Republican, in large part because he has been facing sharp criticism from conservative groups and independent budget analysts for expanding the state's overall indebtedness, even as the state has amassed multibillion-dollar budget surpluses from year to year.</p>
        <p>New York's debt has grown by more than 30 percent in the six years since the governor took office, bringing the total to more than $37 billion, the largest for any state in the country. The debt is one of the major reasons that the state's credit rating on Wall Street is among the poorest in the nation. It is also forcing the state to spend nearly $4 billion a year on debt service.</p>
        <p>The budget that Mr. Pataki and the leaders agreed upon calls for spending $77.5 billion to provide hefty spending increases for education, health care, transportation, public colleges and universities and other programs. The finished product reflects the state's continued economic prosperity by relying heavily on the surging tax revenues that are largely generated by huge profits on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>The budget also provides a bounty of new tax cuts that would save New Yorkers $1.3 billion a year when fully phased in over the next four years. The biggest part is $330 million to cut a tax on utility companies that is passed on to consumers each month. The package also establishes tax deductions for college tuition costs, provides tax credits for low-wage workers and gives new tax breaks to married couples who are paying higher income taxes than if they were single.</p>
        <p>At a news conference today at the State Capitol, Mr. Pataki said the budget struck a balance among new spending for education, tax cuts and larger cash reserves to balance future budgets. He also said the plan to restrict the state's rapidly growing borrowing would help place the state on firm financial footing.</p>
        <p>''This budget includes the most fundamental debt reform in the history of New York State,'' Mr. Pataki said.</p>
        <p>The state budget was due on April 1, but for the 16th consecutive year, the Legislature and the governor failed to meet that deadline.</p>
        <p>But the agreement reached today almost certainly means that the governor and the leaders will complete their work this year earlier than they have in recent memory. Last year, for example, the budget was adopted on Aug. 4 -- 126 days overdue.</p>
        <p>To breach the gap between the deadline and this week's action, the Legislature had to pass contingency budgets that kept spending at last year's levels. While the delay does not cost the taxpayers more, it does impose hardship on localities, particularly school districts that need to know the amount of state money to expect so that they can determine their own budgets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki's aides said the state's general fund budget, which consists of revenues from state taxes and fees that are not committed to specific purposes, would rise by about 4.7 percent, or nearly $1.8 billion more than last year's $37 billion. The governor had proposed a 2.3 percent, or nearly $1 billion, increase in general fund spending.</p>
        <p>But this year's total state spending would increase by about $4.1 billion, or 5.7 percent, to $77.5 billion, according to another calculation. That calculation includes federal money that passes through the state budget and other money that is not included in the general fund. Mr. Pataki had proposed an increase of 5.5 percent, or $3.9 billion, in total state spending.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki's budget officials could not be specific about a third calculation that is used to measure the budget, known as state funds. But officials said they expected that figure -- which includes the general fund, debt service, capital projects and several special dedicated revenue funds -- to be significantly higher than the $49.8 billion that it was last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, and the majority leader of the State Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican, predicted today that the entire budget would be passed as early as this week by the Legislature.</p>
        <p>The biggest spending increase in the budget goes to education. It provides a record $1.2 billion, or 8.7 percent, rise in state aid to public school districts statewide, bringing the total amount spent on education to about $13 billion. New York City is expected to receive about $400 million of the total increase.</p>
        <p>The budget also requires the state to continue the planned expansion of its program to provide prekindergarten classes to all 4-year-olds, and to reduce class sizes in the early grades, at a cost of nearly $200 million. That program was included at the insistence of Democrats who control the Assembly.</p>
        <p>The budget also contained initiatives sought by Republicans who control the Senate. They include expanding a program that subsidizes prescription drugs for the low-income elderly, at a cost of about $180 million.</p>
        <p>The agreement also adds $750 million in a reserve fund to hedge against an economic downturn and to make up for revenue lost to future tax cuts that the governor and the Legislature had enacted in previous years. Mr. Pataki had insisted that the money be placed in reserve.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Pataki's insistence, the lawmakers also agreed to pass a law that would, for the first time, impose limits on state debt, to be phased in over the next 10 years. Ultimately, it would restrict the state's outstanding debt to no more than 4 percent of New York residents' personal income.</p>
        <p>Now, the state's $37 billion debt load is more than 6 percent of total personal income, whereas most other states have a debt load that is about 3 percent of personal income, said Colleen Woodell, the director of public finance for Standard &amp; Poor's, the debt rating agency.</p>
        <p>Ms. Woodell said it was encouraging that state leaders were taking action to restrain future borrowing and to reduce the state's existing debt. ''It's a good thing that they are adopting this,'' she said. ''But the question is, can they live with it?''</p>
        <p>New York has the largest debt of any state, and analysts have urged Mr. Pataki and legislative leaders to use the state's recent series of budget surpluses to make early payments on some of that debt, thereby reducing the principal and lowering future interest payments.</p>
        <p>But the state's debt has ballooned since Mr. Pataki took office in 1995, when the total indebtedness totaled $28.2 billion. The state now spends nearly $4 billion, or 5 percent of all state revenues, to make payments on that debt. The median among the states is 3.5 percent, according to budget experts.</p>
        <p>THE HIGHLIGHTS  What the Budget Agreement Calls For</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki and leaders of the Legislature have reached agreement on a state budget of $77.5 billion, a 5.6 percent increase over last year. The largest share is devoted to education and transportation. The legislators accepted some of Mr. Pataki's plan for debt reform but rejected his proposals to build a new prison and expand the lottery to include Powerball.</p>
        <p>TAX CUTS -- The budget would cut $1.3 billion in taxes, with the bulk of the cuts phased in over the next four years. About $330 million would come from reducing a state tax on electric power. The state would also become the first to allow parents to deduct college tuition -- up to $10,000 per student -- from their income taxes. And the budget plan would eliminate the ''marriage penalty,'' under which married couples often pay more in income tax than two single people.</p>
        <p>EDUCATION -- State officials plan to increase school aid by $1.2 billion over last year, directing about $190 million to a program that provides prekindergarten classes to all 4-year-olds and reduces class sizes in the early grades. The Legislature also adopted Mr. Pataki's plan to recruit more teachers for public schools.</p>
        <p>TRANSPORTATION -- Lawmakers agreed to spend $17.1 billion over five years on mass transit projects and an additional $17.1 billion for improvements to bridges and highways. The transit money includes money for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to plan a Second Avenue subway line that runs the full length of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>HEALTH CARE -- A program that subsidizes prescription drugs for the elderly would be expanded at a cost of $180 million. The budget also contains a 5 percent increase in revenue sharing for local governments to help pay for a new program that would provide medical coverage for as many as one million uninsured New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>DEBT PAYMENT -- The budget would triple, to $750 million, the size of a two-year-old fund used to repay the state's $37 billion debt, and adopt a series of fiscal measures that restricts borrowing and places a cap on future debt.</p>
