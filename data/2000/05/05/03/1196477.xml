        <p>WE fly higher and faster,'' said Bill Wagner, a pilot. ''We can get from Des Moines, Iowa, to Washington, D.C., in about two hours with no delays. And we've never lost a piece of luggage.''</p>
        <p>But hold on before inquiring where to book your next business trip on this astonishing airline. Mr. Wagner flies an executive jet for the Townsend Engineering Company of Des Moines, one of more than 11,000 American companies that own corporate aircraft. To take a business trip on Townsend's Cessna Citation X, an eight-passenger mid-size executive jet, or its six-passenger Piper Cheyenne propeller plane, you generally have to be an employee or a customer of the company, which manufactures processing machines for domestic and foreign meat packers.</p>
        <p>The corporate-jet business has abandoned the defensive crouch it went into for years after the shareholder revulsion generated by the celebrated business excesses of the mid-  to late 1980's, when legendary corporate Champagne Charlies like F. Ross Johnson of RJR Nabisco presided imperially over fleets of expensive jets that could be dispatched on a whim, say to fetch a pet.</p>
        <p>The business has come back at full throttle, thanks to a booming economy, a reaction against the delays and frustrations of commercial airlines, and a pronounced change in attitudes as corporate managers justify the expense of a company plane as a business tool. It is seen as a productive way to transport not only top executives, but also the middle-management teams that are increasingly spanning out on ever-wider business trips.</p>
        <p>Corporate jets are ''very expensive -- so they'd better provide a return on that investment of significant value or you cannot realistically own one,'' said Ted Townsend, the president of Townsend Engineering. Some big companies, like Wal-Mart Stores, operate big fleets of aircraft for a variety of business reasons, but even smaller operations like Townsend Engineering use planes for functions besides transportation, including things like shipping spare parts to outlying areas.</p>
        <p>Though he admits to fervently loving his jet, Mr. Townsend says that its value is strictly practical for a company like his, a machinery maker whose sales and service staffs have to be quick-footed, wide-ranging and happy on the job. ''With our location in the central part of the country, we can go anyplace in the United States and still come home for dinner,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The number of companies owning jets and other turbine-engine aircraft increased more than fivefold over the last 30 years, to more 11,000 by 1998, according to the National Business Aviation Association. American companies now operate about 6,200 jets, 5,100 turbo-prop planes and 5,000 helicopters.</p>
        <p>But the climb wasn't steady. After a steep ascent through the 1970's, sales of business aircraft flattened in the late 1980's. In 1992, manufacturers delivered 348 new business jets and turbo-props, according to the General Aviation Manufacturers Association. Last year, the number was 778.</p>
        <p>It was a long haul to change the corporate jet's image as a toy for pampered executives, industry experts say. ''To a certain extent, the community brought this upon itself many years ago when they emphasized the tremendous comfort, luxury and special privilege of a company airplane,'' said Jack Olcott, the president of the National Business Aviation Association, a trade group that represents corporate aircraft owners. ''The excesses of the '80's were really only very limited examples, but they received tremendous media attention.''</p>
        <p>Even corporations with big corporate fleets depend heavily on commercial aviation for most of their business travel, he noted. ''The enlightened company uses the airlines when appropriate, and business aviation when appropriate,'' he said.</p>
        <p>One of the fastest-growing areas in business aviation is in companies that operate corporate jets for charter and for use by clients who purchase fractional shares of a plane or a group of planes, allowing them to have an aircraft available when they want it. The number of companies with fractional-ownership deals doubled, to 1,125, from 1997 to 1998, according to the business aviation trade group.</p>
        <p>Not only is the corporate jet back, but it's getting bigger. The Boeing Company is now marketing its new Boeing Business Jet, which has an 807-square-foot interior -- about twice the space of other top-line corporate jets. The plane costs about $38 million, with another $8 to $12 million for accessories and other options. So far, Boeing has orders for 56 of them.</p>
        <p>Fred Kelley, a spokesman for the Boeing Business Jet division, described the plane as ''basically a hybrid 737,'' with modifications, including bigger fuel tanks that give it a flying range of about 6,200 miles, similar to the Gulfstream V and twice the range of the Boeing 737 aircraft used domestically by many commercial airlines. The appeal of having a ''global presence'' accounts for the longer range, Mr. Kelley said. The size reflects a demand for flying more people, including management teams, and equipping them to work in flight with ''all the things you would have in a normal office,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelley and other Boeing executives recently returned from a 40-day barnstorming trip on one of the new planes through Europe and the Middle East. Negative public attitudes toward business aircraft remain especially entrenched in Europe, where ''if you have a private jet, you don't talk about it,'' Mr. Kelley said, adding: ''We're trying to convert people's thinking into seeing it as a business tool, rather than it being an excessive perquisite for the C.E.O., the royal barge kind of image.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelley said the trip was productive. ''I flew 150 hours, 48,000 miles, in 40 days,'' he said. ''I wouldn't want to even think about doing that on commercial flights.''</p>
