        <p>Comings and Goings</p>
        <p>Trois Jean, a French bistro at 154 East 79th Street, has closed. Jean-Luc Andriot, the managing partner, who said he wanted more time with his family, has formed a consulting company. Jean-Louis Dumonet, the chef, is now the executive chef at Palladin on West 49th Street. The Trois Jean space has been rented by Henry Hershkowitz and his partners in the Screening Room in TriBeCa. They plan to open the Dining Room, designed by Larry Bogdanow, in July. Without movies.</p>
        <p>La Fourchette, an elegant spot at 1608 First Avenue (84th Street), has closed. The chef, Marc Murphy, will work at Chinoiserie, the restaurant that is to open in August in the Giraffe Hotel, on Park Avenue South and 26th Street. Chinoiserie will be run by an owner of La Fourchette, Abraham Merchant.</p>
        <p>Delphini, a Mediterranean restaurant at 519 Columbus Avenue (85th Street), has closed. Turgut Balikci and Kemal Binici, the new owners, will turn it into a French brasserie.</p>
        <p>Short Orders</p>
        <p>Domingo, 209 East 49th Street, has been redecorated and has become Placido Domingo Restaurant and Tapas Bar. Patricia Quintana, an author of Mexican cookbooks, has revised the menu, with Spanish and Mexican dishes.</p>
        <p>Alaia, partly owned by the actor Stephen Baldwin and named for his daughter, is to become Luahn in a few weeks. Luahn is the name of a boat on which the chef, Tim Eagan, worked as a teenager.</p>
        <p>Chefs on the Move</p>
        <p>Patricia Williams, the former chef at Berkeley Bar and Grill, has moved to Butterfield 81, 170 East 81st Street. Butterfield 81's former chef, Tom Valenti, will be opening a restaurant at Broadway and 84th Street.</p>
        <p>The new chef at Patroon, 160 East 46th Street, is Craig Coupani, formerly of ''21'' Club and Tabla. He replaces Geoffrey Zakarian, who will be the chef at Town, which is to open on 56th Street in the fall.</p>
