        <p>There was heavy editing to the first lineup card posted by the Yankees' hitting coach, Chris Chambliss, tonight. It was covered with black blotches, the names and accompanying positions obliterated and then revised.</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch was out with a sprained wrist, and the new leadoff hitter had a batting average of .170 -- but Ricky Ledee hit a home run, his first of the season. The new second baseman, Wilson Delgado, ripped a two-run double. The catcher, Chris Turner, played in his first game for the Yankees, hit an important double and guided Andy Pettitte through most of the 4-2 victory against Cleveland.</p>
        <p>It doesn't seem to matter who plays for the Yankees these days; Choo Choo Coleman and Marv Throneberry could wear Yankee pinstripes and be transformed. They are getting strong starting pitching and strong relief and scraping together enough offense, and their 17-8 record is the American League's best. The Yankees have won 23 of 32 regular-season games in Jacobs Field, this victory coming with a makeshift lineup.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch was scratched from the starting lineup because of his sprained left wrist, and unless he feels markedly better Friday, he will probably be placed on the 15-day disabled list. Delgado started at second base, in the 67th game of his major league career. He is not hard to miss when the Yankees take batting practice. Delgado is generously listed at 5 feet 11 inches and 165 pounds -- he is probably shorter and lighter -- and he tends to dump a lot of balls over the infield, rather than launching rockets over the fences. When asked about Delgado's offensive potential, Manager Joe Torre replied, ''Well, he's a good defensive player.''</p>
        <p>Delgado does not have the experience of the man he is essentially replacing, Luis Sojo. The Yankees don't have someone like Darryl Strawberry on their bench, the big left-handed slugger who frightens opposing managers; Lance Johnson hits singles and steals bases.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Homer Bush came off the Yankee bench with his awesome speed and he stole a few bases and won a few games. Now there is Clay Bellinger, whose strength is versatility. Joe Girardi was once the Yankees' backup catcher, and now the backups are Jim Leyritz and Turner.</p>
        <p>But while the Yankee bench doesn't seem as deep or as strong, it is contributing in meaningful ways. Leyritz is hitting .125, but on April 16, his home run in the seventh inning snapped a 4-4 tie with the Kansas City Royals. Three days later, Johnson started and spurred the offense with four hits and two steals against the Texas Rangers. When the Rangers tied the game in the ninth inning that day, Bellinger slammed a game-winning home run in the 10th inning. Even Alfonso Soriano slugged an important home run in his otherwise turbulent and temporary tenure as third baseman.</p>
        <p>Delgado and Turner stepped in tonight, with Ledee moving to the leadoff spot. The Yankees led by 1-0 after Bernie Williams hit a solo home run in the fourth inning. Scott Brosius singled to open the fifth, and Turner -- who found himself nervous all day, ''feeling butterflies'' before his first start with the Yankees -- hammered a double against the center-field fence. Brosius stopped at third.</p>
        <p>Delgado was next. He learned just before batting practice that he would play, and he didn't know anything about Knoblauch's injury until reporters told him after the game. But what Delgado did know, as he batted in the fifth inning, was that Cleveland's Bobby Witt would challenge him with fastballs. ''They wanted me to show what I can do,'' Delgado said after the game, before pausing, then adding. ''But I can play.''</p>
        <p>Delgado lined a ball between the outfielders in right and center, the ball rolling and rolling, Brosius and Turner scoring. Delgado stood at second with two R.B.I. -- matching Knoblauch's total for the first month of the season.</p>
        <p>Turner had never worked with Pettitte in spring training, only watching him from afar. They sat together in the dugout during Monday's game, discussing how they might try to pitch against the Cleveland hitters, something the American League has done with great success this year. Coming into tonight's game, the Indians had scored only 121 runs, third fewest in the league, ahead of the Detroit Tigers (84 runs) and, amazingly, the first-place Yankees (114).</p>
        <p>Pettitte retired the first 12 batters he faced, nine of those on groundball  outs, and no Cleveland batter hit the ball out of the infield in the first four innings. Manny Ramirez opened the fifth with a single and Pettitte wavered, walking home a run.</p>
        <p>But Pettitte recovered, and in the seventh, Ledee lifted a home run deep into the right-field stands; he muted his smile until he returned to the dugout, and then, Torre said, ''He was cheesing from ear to ear.''</p>
        <p>Jeff Nelson took over in the seventh and pitched two innings, Mariano Rivera overcame an error and an unearned run in the ninth, whiffing Enrique Wilson to end the game.</p>
        <p>The bullpen has an earned run average of 1.31 over its last 11 games. The starters have an E.R.A.  of 1.67 in the last turn through the rotation. The names in the lineup can be obliterated, blacked out, changed and switched, but so long as the Yankees get that kind of pitching, there won't be any revisionism in the American League.</p>
