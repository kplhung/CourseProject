        <p>Donald P. Jacobs jumps into a swimming pool every day at 6:30 a.m. and spends 45 minutes doing laps. During rainstorms, he sometimes dashes without an umbrella between buildings on the Northwestern University campus here, even as the wind off Lake Michigan musses his hair. When he gives public speeches, he often wears a sweatshirt. And when he finds something funny, he throws his head back, crosses his arms over his chest and guffaws.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs has a rather loose style for a business school dean, especially one who passed the traditional retirement age seven years ago. But nothing is frivolous about his accomplishments: No one has had a greater effect on management education in the United States than he has, say his peers at schools around the country.</p>
        <p>This spring, Mr. Jacobs is celebrating his 25th anniversary at the helm of the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern. He has held his job longer than any current major university president or other business school dean, higher education experts say. When he took over, Cal Ripken Jr. was playing high school baseball and Pope John Paul II was still Karol Wojtyla, archbishop of Cracow.</p>
        <p>Along the way, Mr. Jacobs created the prototype of the modern business school, management experts say. Well before many of its rivals, Kellogg interviewed all its applicants, published students' evaluations of its professors' teaching skills and encouraged students to help design the curriculum.</p>
        <p>In other words, Kellogg caters to its students as if they were customers. It unabashedly considers the teaching of skills like teamwork and social networking as central to its mission, and seeks students who agree. ''If you think you are that kind of person, you fit,'' Mr. Jacobs recently told a group of accepted applicants. ''If not, this is the time to get the hell out,'' he added, to much laughter.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the changes -- many of which once seemed heretical in the world of higher education -- and to the recruitment of ambitious young professors, the school that once had little respect on its own campus steadily climbed the national rankings, securing a solid spot in the top five and forcing more prestigious schools to imitate it.</p>
        <p>Professors say Mr. Jacobs is the symbol for the business school boom that over the last quarter-century has tripled, to 100,000, the number of M.B.A.'s awarded each year.</p>
        <p>''No one has quite done what Don has done,'' said Rajat Gupta, the managing partner of McKinsey &amp; Company, who sits on advisory boards at Kellogg, Harvard and the Universities of Chicago and Pennsylvania. ''Which is to transform an average school into a top five school and keep it there for some time.''</p>
        <p>In a business world that craves speed and flexibility, Mr. Jacobs, jovial and blunt-spoken, has also become something of a model manager himself, colleagues say. Kellogg, with a relatively small administrative staff, relies on its version of factory-floor employees -- its students -- to study many of its problems and suggest solutions. Unlike many academic institutions, it acts quickly, putting in place pilot programs and deciding later whether they deserve a permanent place in the curriculum. ''He pushes constant change,'' said Robert Duncan, a professor of leadership who has taught at the school since 1970.</p>
        <p>Last summer, for example, reacting to student criticism that Kellogg had not devoted enough attention to the Internet, Mr. Jacobs and a few faculty members drew up plans for an e-commerce major that covers 16 courses. It is already the third-most-popular major at the school.</p>
        <p>At the core of Mr. Jacobs's strategy has been a strengthening of the ties between the ivory tower and a business world that sometimes views intellectuals as eggheads. Over the skepticism of other Northwestern officials, he built an executive education center 20 years ago that now brings in $93 million a year and has inspired similar versions at Stanford, Pennsylvania and other schools. He was also among the first deans to encourage professors to make international trips a part of actual classes.</p>
        <p>He continues to teach, both the full-time day students and the executives who pass through. Between 1975 and 1979, he served as the chairman of Amtrak and has also been a director for First Chicago, Commonwealth Edison and Hart Marx, the high-end clothing company. (One of his board stints, on a meat-packing company, even turned him into a vegetarian, he said, after he had learned the details of the industry's operations.)</p>
        <p>A competitive man whose sometimes fiery temper has cooled only recently, friends say, and who needs little provocation before lobbing insults about the nearby University of Chicago, Mr. Jacobs says Kellogg makes a legitimate claim to be the nation's top business school. More removed experts call that wishful thinking, if only barely. Given the choice, most students enroll at Harvard or Stanford over Kellogg, for example. And after building a top-notch faculty, Kellogg has lost a few stars to rival schools in the last three years and has not replaced them with researchers of the same rank, professors say.</p>
        <p>Most management experts agree, however, that few graduate schools of any kind have come as far over the last 25 years, and few institutions bear the mark of their leader as much as this one. ''His personality really infuses the place,'' said Mike Miles, the former chairman of Philip Morris who heads the school's advisory board.</p>
        <p>In fact, some students and professors worry that Kellogg's biggest problem is that Mr. Jacobs has not surrounded himself with strong candidates to replace him, even though he plans to retire in a few years and spend more time teaching. ''There's nobody that is a natural successor to Dean Jacobs within the school right now,'' said James Schlesinger Jr., the former editor of the student paper, who will graduate this spring.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs grew up as the son of bakers on the far west side of Chicago, three blocks from the suburb of Oak Park that Frank Lloyd Wright was making famous. Until junior high school he suffered from what doctors would now call dyslexia and, he said, is still terrible at remembering names. He enlisted in the Navy at 17, just weeks before Japan surrendered in World War II. He returned home and attended Roosevelt University in Chicago, where an economics professor encouraged him to take up the subject. Mr. Jacobs eventually earned a doctorate in economics at Columbia. ''I never, ever thought of being anything but a professor,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His first job was at City College in New York. Northwestern's business school offered him a post in the 1950's, but the dean at the time, Richard Donham, son of the founding dean of Harvard Business School, asked him to promise to teach in the executive education program, a forum that many faculty members deemed intellectually weak. Dr. Donham ''wouldn't have hired me if I wouldn't do it,'' Mr. Jacobs said.</p>
        <p>The experience changed his view of business education and, eventually, remade Kellogg.</p>
        <p>Over the next two decades, Mr. Jacobs taught finance and, in 1974, found himself on a search committee to find a replacement for John Barr, the former chief executive of Montgomery Ward who was then stepping down as head of Northwestern's business school. The committee offered the job to a French diplomat and to administrators at both Princeton University and the University of Pennsylvania. All three said no.</p>
        <p>''And then the search committee,'' said Professor Duncan, another committee member, ''almost in desperation, said: 'Enough is enough. Somebody's got to be dean.' '' Mr. Jacobs, as the senior faculty member on the committee, was the choice, and he set aside his academic career to accept the post. ''He wasn't thrilled about it,'' Professor Duncan said. ''I don't know that anyone was thrilled about it.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Jacobs threw himself into the job almost immediately. On his first day, a Monday, he told the outgoing dean that he wanted the school to focus, in part, on the teaching of business people who were in their 30's and 40's and no longer interested in attending school full-time. By Friday, he was meeting with James Allen, a founder of Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, to pitch his idea to build a separate executive education center for weeklong and monthlong classes. The following Monday, Mr. Allen agreed to finance much of the project, and the planning began.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs's idea was hardly met with unanimous enthusiasm. ''The university thought he was crazy,'' said Meyer Feldberg, now the dean at Columbia, who was the center's first director. More prestigious schools like Harvard already had thriving programs, and with the economy in an inflation-induced funk, companies were not rushing to make large new investments.</p>
        <p>But when the center, named for Mr. Allen, opened in 1979, the corporate landscape was changing. Globalization of markets and acceleration of technological change had made doing business more complicated. The Allen Center had little trouble filling its seats, and Northwestern professors soon had the advantage of being in constant contact with their core audience.</p>
        <p>''Our faculty were good theorists,'' Mr. Jacobs said, ''but they honestly understood the problems businesses really faced. It was one of the things that made us different.''</p>
        <p>The Allen Center also became an unofficial advertisement for Kellogg, as the school became known in 1979 after a gift from relatives of the cereal company family who were largely unconnected to the business. After a few weeks of study in Evanston, executives went home more willing to consider Northwestern graduates as well as the Harvard, Pennsylvania and Chicago M.B.A.'s that they had long hired.</p>
        <p>Robert Hamada, dean of Chicago's Graduate School of Business, offering a rare compliment for the local competition, said, ''He was the first of the major deans -- and he wasn't even a major dean at the time -- to think in terms of marketing.'' In fact, after years of ignoring the market, Chicago itself began offering executive classes a few years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs's big headache now is how to exit gracefully and allow a smooth transition. It is a problem the students in his corporate governance classes study in detail but that he says is difficult to solve at a university, where a successor is chosen by a committee rather than groomed.</p>
        <p>''The question of succession drives me crazy,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''A well-run organization probably would have gotten rid of me by now.''</p>
