        <p>Boro Pres Howard Golden letter on Bob Herbert's Apr 27 column scores New York City Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani's use of budget cuts to punish public officials who disagree with him</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Bob Herbert (column, April 27) ably demonstrates how Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani uses his budget ax to punish his critics inside government. The fiscal gouging that the office of Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller, received in the executive budget is just one example of how the mayor has tried to harm public officials who disagree with him.</p>
        <p>The mayor also cut city financing to the Brooklyn borough president's office by $300,000. Of New York City's five borough presidents, I am the only one to suffer such a financing decrease, which punishes the 2.5 million people of Brooklyn.</p>

        <p>Mr. Giuliani's maneuvering came only after I opposed both his ill-advised waste-transfer station plans for our city's garbage and his efforts to use public parkland for private sports teams without required community review.</p>
