        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Campaign Prognosis for Giuliani: Putting Cancer in Its Place and Feeling in Control'' (Metro Matters column, May 1): Joyce Purnick's moving account of people with cancer who insist on living normal lives brought tears to my eyes and pride to my soul as I recalled the valiant battle that my wife, Joan, fought with ovarian cancer. For her, going to work every day was as much part of her therapy as drugs and radiation.</p>
        <p>When her cancer was discovered, it had already reached the terminal stage. Yet she worked for three and a half years longer, until the day she went to the hospital for the last eight weeks of her life. Her oncologist told his colleagues that it was her spirit, combined with her faith, that kept her alive and living fully until the last.</p>
