        <p>Under increasing pressure, Time Warner restored the signals of ABC television stations to 3.5 million homes yesterday afternoon after agreeing to a temporary truce in its contractual impasse with the Walt Disney Company.</p>
        <p>The settlement put off until July 15 a deadline for Time Warner Cable and Disney, which owns ABC, to come to terms on how much the cable company will pay Disney for use of three of its cable channels. Time Warner had sought an eight-month extension on the talks.</p>
        <p>Homes in seven areas around the country, including parts of New York, Los Angeles and Houston, had been without ABC for more than 39 hours when the programming resumed at about 3:21 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time. In New York, the actress Rebecca Herbst appeared, playing Elizabeth Webber on the program ''General Hospital,'' crying because her boyfriend, Lucky, no longer seemed interested in her. Time Warner had cut off the ABC stations as of 12:01 a.m. Monday.</p>
        <p>Time Warner's decision came just before the Federal Communications Commission was about to rule in favor of Disney's request to force Time Warner to restore the signal until after the current ratings sweeps month ends on May 24.</p>
        <p>Pressure had grown on Time Warner as politicians in Washington and New York either urged Time Warner to put ABC back on the air or declared they would hold hearings on the issue. ABC also planned a joint venture with DirectTV, a satellite company, to buy and install satellite dishes in Los Angeles, New York and Houston for viewers seeking an alternative to Time Warner's cable service.</p>
        <p>ABC's ratings were not severely affected Monday night, even with Time Warner blacking out 3.5 million of the 100 million homes with television sets. A celebrity version of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' drew a rating of 22.1 (each point represents about one million homes). In fact, in the New York area, where the signal was pulled from 1.5 million homes, about 15 percent of the total there, the show exceeded the national average. But in Houston, where almost half the city's homes are linked to Time Warner cable, the falloff was noticeable as both ''Millionaire'' and many other ABC shows were down sharply.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's settlement came in full view of reporters assembled for a news conference called by Time Warner to propose a new Oct. 15 deadline for the compensation talks. Disney officials, responding quickly to a letter sent by Time Warner, simply changed the date to July and faxed it to Time Warner executives, who, after an impromptu huddle, accepted it in the middle of answering questions about their October offer. Time Warner executives called the acceptance of ABC's date a gesture of good faith.</p>
        <p>Officials at the Federal Communications Commission had regarded the dispute as a private matter between the two companies, and had urged them to resolve it between themselves. But the F.C.C.'s preliminary analysis had concluded that a 1993 commission regulation prohibited the broadcaster from being pulled from a cable system during a ratings sweeps month, federal officials said.</p>
        <p>The F.C.C. decision could come into play again over the new deadline because July is also a ratings sweep month. Robert A. Iger, the Disney president, said he was not thinking of the sweep month factor when he suggested the date be changed to July. But in a reflection of the continuing hostility between the two companies, Mike Luftman, a spokesman for Time Warner, said, ''It's very hard to accept that anything Disney says or does in this matter has an innocent reason to it.''</p>
        <p>Government officials said they were relieved by yesterday's truce agreement, although frustrated that it had required a temporary blackout that penalized millions of viewers. The F.C.C. chairman, William E. Kennard, called the situation a ''game of brinkmanship'' and said in a statement, ''The television sets of average consumers should never be held hostage in these disputes.''</p>
        <p>Strong pressure had been building in political quarters to end the impasse. Senator John McCain, the Republican from Arizona who leads the Senate Commerce Committee, had already scheduled a hearing for next Wednesday to address issues raised by Time Warner's decision to take ABC off its systems. After the truce was announced, Mr. McCain postponed the hearing until July.</p>
        <p>Other lawmakers, including Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat, had written to top executives of both companies asking that ABC's signal be restored while the companies continued to talk.</p>
        <p>In New York, in a news conference before the two sides broke their stalemate, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani assailed Time Warner, calling it an ''out-of-touch monopoly,'' with leaders who ''haven't given us the courtesy'' of explaining their reasoning. In a separate news conference, the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, established a commission to investigate and hold hearings on the actions of the companies. Mr. Vallone threatened yesterday to subpoena the top executives of both companies to explain their actions before a council committee.</p>
        <p>The agreement may not augur a new tone to future negotiations. Disney executives said the company would still go ahead with its satellite dish plan, in which the company and DirectTV will offer to repay consumers for the entire $198 cost of the purchase and installation.</p>
        <p>Disney had set up a similar deal in Houston and more than 15,000 homes had signed on with DirectTV as a result. That program had become a serious factor in the growing enmity between Time Warner and Disney, with the cable company's executives saying that Disney was trying to undermine its business. As one condition in the most recent negotiations between the two companies, Time Warner has been demanding that Disney pay a fee for every customer it has lost to DirectTV in Houston.</p>
        <p>Mr. Luftman of Time Warner said that Disney's decision to go ahead with its plan to pay consumers to switch to satellite distribution, after Time Warner had taken a step to help resolve the impasse, was a ''nakedly hostile act'' that was ''another indication that Disney is engaging in a campaign of destruction.'' The move ''can't help but cast a dark cloud over the negotiations,'' Mr. Luftman said.</p>
        <p>Disney and Time Warner have been at loggerheads since their compensation agreement expired in December. The dispute has centered on how much Time Warner will pay for Disney's Toon, Soap and Disney cable channels. The payments are the means through which Disney is compensated for allowing the cable system to carry the network's broadcast stations. Disney had asked for carriage for new cable channels as well as a sizable subscriber fee for its existing Disney Channel, which the company wants to shift from a premium cable channel to a basic cable channel.</p>
        <p>Time Warner executives have maintained Disney made new demands after America Online announced its plan to merge with Time Warner. Disney executives acknowledged that the proposed merger changed the media landscape so much that it caused them to reconsider the terms they had previously been leaning toward accepting.</p>
        <p>Time Warner said Disney's new demands would have pushed the costs to Time Warner up beyond the December agreement about $300 million over 10 years. Time Warner executives said they would have had no choice but to pass on the costs to their customers, raising monthly cable bills by $1.</p>
        <p>Patricia Matson, the senior vice president of communications for ABC called the speculative $1 increase ''another bogus Time Warner figure.'' Mr. Iger had previously called the $300 million figure preposterous and yesterday he said the companies were actually not very far apart financially.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 8, 2000, Monday  Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Wednesday about the dispute between Time Warner and ABC over cable television retransmission fees misspelled the name of the company that is joining with ABC to install home satellite dishes. It is DirecTV, not DirectTV.</p>
