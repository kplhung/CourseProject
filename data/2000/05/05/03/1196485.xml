        <p>With his Maple Leafs now trailing their four-of-seven-game Eastern Conference semifinal series against the Devils, 2-1, and his top line 0 for the series, the Toronto captain, Mats Sundin, is beginning to feel the heat that inevitably comes with being the offensive leader of Canada's favorite team.</p>
        <p>''It goes with the territory,'' Sundin said today. ''For us to win and be successful, our line has to be productive. And thus far, we haven't done that.''</p>

        <p>With his Maple Leafs now trailing their four-of-seven-game Eastern Conference semifinal series against the Devils, 2-1, and his top line 0 for the series, the Toronto captain, Mats Sundin, is beginning to feel the heat that inevitably comes with being the offensive leader of Canada's favorite team.</p>
        <p>''It goes with the territory,'' Sundin said today. ''For us to win and be successful, our line has to be productive. And thus far, we haven't done that.''</p>
        <p>The line has a combined 11 shots on goal and no points in three games; its production in Toronto's first-round series with Ottawa was 20 points and 60 shots. It's not a coincidence that the Maple Leafs won that series in six games.</p>
        <p>Hence the Leafs' current predicament. Not to mention the mounting pressure on Toronto's Coach and General Manager, Pat Quinn, to make a change on his top line, which Sundin centers for Jonas Hoglund and Steve Thomas. But Quinn seemed to indicate today that he would leave the line intact, at least for Wednesday night's Game 4 at Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if a change in personnel will make a difference,'' Quinn said. ''A change of approach may.''</p>
        <p>Asked what he meant by a change of approach, Quinn said of his top line, ''They're playing on the outside. They're not involved now. Well, one of the guys is, the others are not. And unless we can get them involved, we'll have the same results.''</p>
        <p>Quinn did not name the two members of the line he was dissatisfied with. But Sundin has only two shots on goal in the series. Hoglund has five, but took no shots in the 5-1 loss Monday night. Thomas, the member of the line who crashes the net the hardest, has four shots on goal for the series.</p>
        <p>''I don't mind playing against that line,'' Thomas said of New Jersey's threesome of Bobby Holik, Steve Kelly and Randy McKay. ''We haven't been scored on yet. Of course, we haven't scored yet, either. But I'm really confident we can turn it up a notch.''</p>
        <p>The Sundin line had better turn it up. The Leafs have scored only three goals in the series. Much of that is a testament not only to Holik's line, but also to the defensive team of Scott Stevens and Brian Rafalski as well. Stevens shut down Pavel Bure (one goal) in New Jersey's four-game first-round sweep of Florida.</p>
        <p>''We're not even getting any pressure in their zone to even test them,'' Thomas said, when asked about playing against Stevens. ''I've been hit once by Scott in three games. So it hasn't really been his physical presence. He moves the puck well and wins battles in the corners. We've got to win the battles in the corners.''</p>
        <p>And that is difficult, considering the Sundin line's penchant for playing on the perimeter in this series.</p>
        <p>''We have to make that Holik line, and Stevens and Rafalski play our game,'' Sundin said. ''We haven't put any pressure on them in their end.''</p>
        <p>''On the forecheck and coming up through the neutral zone, we need to be closer together,'' Thomas said. ''Too many one-man rushes with no support. We have to move our legs and get ourselves involved early.''</p>
        <p>As Sundin said, ''It starts with our line. The rest will follow.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>BRYAN BERARD, the Toronto defenseman who nearly lost his right eye after he was hit by the stick of Ottawa's MARIAN HOSSA on March 11, is planning to attend Wednesday night's Game 4 with his agent, TOM LAIDLAW. Berard is fighting to regain sight in the eye.</p>
