        <p>Gannett, the nation's largest newspaper publisher, said yesterday that John J. Curley would step down as chief executive in June, and named Douglas H. McCorkindale, who has been the company's president since 1997, as his successor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Curley, who is 61, will remain chairman until he retires next year, when Mr. McCorkindale, who is 60, will assume the chairman's title.</p>
        <p>Both men are longtime Gannett executives. Mr. Curley joined the company in 1969; Mr. McCorkindale, two years after that. Since the men are nearly the same age, Wall Street analysts said Mr. Curley's decision to step down represented the start of a transition to the next generation of leadership at Gannett.</p>
        <p>''I'm a little surprised at the timing, but when you think about it, it probably makes some sense,'' said Douglas M. Arthur, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''Curley and McCorkindale are so dominant that investors have not been thinking about who the next generation of leaders will be. With Curley retiring soon, McCorkindale gets his day in the sun. And it gives younger players a chance to step up.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arthur and others identified Tom Curley, publisher and president of Gannett's USA Today, and Gary Watson, who heads the company's newspaper division, as probable future candidates for the top jobs.</p>
        <p>''For both to leave in one fell swoop would have been too disruptive,'' said Kevin Gruneich, an analyst at Bear, Stearns. ''What you have now is a transition that is ongoing.''</p>
        <p>Tom Curley, 51, is the younger brother of the outgoing chief executive. Mr. Watson is 54.</p>
        <p>John Curley announced his decision at the company's annual meeting. He was named chief executive in 1986 and has been chairman and chief executive since April 1989.</p>
        <p>He gave no reason for his decision to step down. But in a statement he said he intended ''to do what I want to do when I want to do it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCorkindale was named president in September 1997. A lawyer, he joined Gannett as general counsel and secretary. He was named chief financial officer in 1984, chief administrative officer in 1986 and vice chairman in 1997.</p>
        <p>It is the first time in Gannett's history that an executive with no newsroom experience has been selected as chief executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Curley, who succeeded Allen H. Neuharth, joined Gannett as an editor in Rochester after working for The Associated Press in New York and New Jersey and for newspapers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''Doug McCorkindale and I have worked together for almost 30 years,'' Mr. Curley said in his statement. ''I am extremely confident Gannett will continue to prosper under his leadership.''</p>
        <p>Analysts said Mr. Curley picked a good time to leave because Gannett is flourishing.</p>
        <p>''The company is in great shape,'' said Lauren Rich Fine, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''USA Today has been gushing with double-digit top-line growth, the newspaper group excluding USA Today has been generating advertising revenue growth with some of the highest margins in the industry, and their broadcasting operations are in good shape.''</p>
        <p>In a tough day for newspaper stocks generally, Gannett's stock closed at $62.5625, down $1.1875.</p>
