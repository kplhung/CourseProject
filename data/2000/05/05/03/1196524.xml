        <p>Howard J. Rubenstein, the public relations impresario, had planned the broad outlines of the Walt Disney Company's public relations strategy well before Time Warner Cable pulled the plug on the Disney-owned ABC network at 12:01 a.m. Monday.</p>
        <p>So when the channels carrying ABC programming faded to blue, except for the yellow letters that declared ''Disney has Taken ABC Away From You,'' Mr. Rubenstein and his clients were ready with their campaign to portray Time Warner as a rapacious monopolist.</p>
        <p>The ensuing 36-hour all-fronts assault involved radio and newspaper advertisements, in-person meetings between Preston R. Padden -- Disney's chief lobbyist -- with media executives and an early-morning call yesterday from the Disney president, Robert A. Iger, to Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York.</p>
        <p>By yesterday afternoon, when the 39-hour blackout of ABC programming ended, the images of both media giants had been muddied, but Disney appeared to have left a clearer message behind.</p>
        <p>Fred Dressler, the senior vice president for programming at Time Warner Cable, said in an interview yesterday that Disney hoped to use the ABC blackout to make it appear that Time Warner was abusing its power and to raise questions about the pending merger with AOL.</p>
        <p>''They were setting us up, that's the whole point,'' Mr. Dressler said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dressler acknowledged that by removing ABC from its systems, Time Warner gave Disney ammunition in its attempts to paint Time Warner as an unyielding monopoly. Still, he said, Time Warner had no choice but to do what it did. ''At some point, you have to put your foot down,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rubenstein said yesterday that over the weekend, an ABC executive ''called me at home and said she thought Time Warner was going to yank ABC off the air.''</p>
        <p>''That's when we started talking about our strategic plan,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Disney's appeals to the public began well before last week. Two months ago, in the Houston area, Disney's ABC affiliate, KTRK-TV, began trying to capture the hearts and minds of Time Warner's customers, and entice them to buy satellite dishes and discard their cable company. The lure was a $99 rebate, courtesy of the station.</p>
        <p>The offer, coming at a time when the station was broadcasting constant warnings that its signal might disappear from the sets of Time-Warner subscribers, led to a war of full-page advertisements in The Houston Chronicle, with the ABC affiliate casting Time Warner as the villain and Time Warner offering $99 worth of free pay-per-view films to counter the ABC initiative.</p>
        <p>Today, the two companies ran competing advertisements again, with the ABC affiliate's beginning, ''When Time Warner illegally dropped ABC 13, they violated your trust as a viewer.'' It continued: ''They want to retaliate against ABC for raising questions about their stranglehold over your television, cable and Internet access. Only an arrogant monopolist would drop its most popular channel to do that.''</p>
        <p>Time Warner's full-page ad, four pages further into the front section of the newspaper, was more narrowly focused on the satellite-dish rebate. It was headlined, ''Do the math before you do the dish.''</p>
        <p>The Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina also was a battleground. Anders Gyllenhaal, the executive editor of The News and Observer in Charlotte, said yesterday: ''ABC and Disney have done a better job of formulating a message. They have said: this is a view of the future when the communications roadways are controlled by a few large companies. Time Warner has not been as vocal in this market with their side of the story.''</p>
        <p>Mike Luftman, a spokesman for Time Warner Cable, said in an interview that it considered public relations a sidelight, marginally relevant to the main objective of concluding its deal with Disney.</p>
        <p>''We just wanted to get the deal done,'' he said. ''This was never fundamentally a public relations battle. Like any difficult deal it had a public relations component to it. And certainly how well you do on the public relations front has an impact on the outcome, but its not going to dictate the outcome. Under the circumstances we were placed in, I would have expected things to come out pretty much the way they did -- a wash.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gyllenhaal said that intervews in his area found little sympathy for either company. ''Most folks see this as a battle of titans where the little folks are getting a raw deal,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Editorial boards in other areas began to weigh in yesterday. The New York Times editorial board, which met Monday with Mr. Padden in a meeting planned the week before, and discussed the issue with Time Warner spokesmen, published an editorial that said the threat to Disney by a combined AOL and Time Warner was real. The Times and ABC News are experimenting with jointly producing a daily Webcast on politics and feature segments for ''20/20'' and ''Good Morning America.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Padden also met with the editorial board of The Orange County Register in California. The Register planned to publish an editorial today. The public thought it was a plague on both companies, said Senator Schumer, a Democrat who talked with both Mr. Iger and Time Warner's chief executive, Gerald Levin, yesterday. ''People didn't care about the internal machinations. They just wanted their TV,'' he said.</p>
