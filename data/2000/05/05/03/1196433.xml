        <p>Bakeries known for their bread are sidling into the cake business. Ecce Panis began making old-fashioned triple-layer cakes with chocolate and vanilla butter cream, $30 each, a few months ago. Now Amy's Bread, 672 Ninth Avenue (46th Street), is baking layer cakes that would win prizes at any county fair.</p>
        <p>Coconut cake with a fluffy meringue icing (left), stunning red velvet cake with creamy white frosting, devil's-food cake and glazed marble Bundt cake are some of the varieties that Molly Wessel bakes, often from family recipes. Amy's cakes (not available at Amy's Bread in Chelsea Market) are sold by the slice, $3.50 to $4; whole cakes, including simple birthday cakes, will be sold at the store in a few weeks.</p>
