        <p>ONE process that can never be rushed is browning onions. Slow cooking caramelizes their natural sugars, building a complex base for hundreds of dishes. This browning is especially important for curries: their flavor comes from the onions almost as much as from the spice mix, even in a dish with many other ingredients.</p>
        <p>Many curries are made the same way, although the meat or other protein may differ. After the onions are browned, the spice mix, or just curry powder, is toasted in the same skillet. A flavorful liquid is then added. And after that, just about any meat, poultry or other protein can be cooked in the sauce to give the dish heft.</p>

        <p>ONE process that can never be rushed is browning onions. Slow cooking caramelizes their natural sugars, building a complex base for hundreds of dishes. This browning is especially important for curries: their flavor comes from the onions almost as much as from the spice mix, even in a dish with many other ingredients.</p>
        <p>Many curries are made the same way, although the meat or other protein may differ. After the onions are browned, the spice mix, or just curry powder, is toasted in the same skillet. A flavorful liquid is then added. And after that, just about any meat, poultry or other protein can be cooked in the sauce to give the dish heft.</p>
        <p>Unlike traditional Western stews, curries are built on their sauces. The protein is almost interchangeable.</p>
        <p>And so, while chicken, shrimp and pork are some of the usual choices for curry, I had another idea. Over the years, almost despite myself, I have become increasingly fond of tofu. The flavor is so subtle as to be almost nonexistent, especially in a full-flavored dish like this one. But the texture is incomparable: silken and creamy. Tofu also needs no real cooking, which makes it even more appealing for a fast curry.</p>
        <p>Tofu is light, so I wanted to make the sauce as substantial as possible. I used canned coconut milk with my caramelized onions. Like heavy cream, coconut milk will thicken a sauce, making it luxurious in almost no time. Then, to add contrasting texture, I decided to use nuts as well. Both walnuts and cashews do splendidly here.</p>
        <p>Because tofu really needs only to be heated through, all the time and work in this dish are in the making of the sauce, starting with those onions. (If you decide to use chicken, shrimp or pork instead, cut half-inch cubes and cook them in the sauce for about five minutes.)</p>
        <p>But the bottom line is the onions: they really must be browned carefully and thoroughly, without burning. The trick is to use oil (not butter) and have the heat high enough that the onions brown in about 10 minutes, and no more than 15. I use medium-high heat, but all stoves are different, so you may have to adjust yours. The oil should be bubbling but not smoking, and you must stir the onions every minute or so. After three or four minutes, they should begin to brown; they are done when their edges are quite dark and their interiors somewhat darkened.</p>
        <p>CURRIED TOFU WITH SOY SAUCE</p>
        <p>Time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons peanut, canola or grape seed oil  1 large onion, peeled and chopped  1 tablespoon curry powder, or to taste  1 cup roughly chopped walnuts or unsalted cashews  1 can (12 to 14 ounces) unsweetened coconut milk  1 block (about 1 pound) tofu, cut into roughly  3/4-inch cubes  2 tablespoons soy sauce, or to taste  Salt and cayenne pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Put oil in a 10- or 12-inch nonstick skillet and turn heat to medium-high. A minute later, add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until edges of onion pieces are well-browned, about 10 minutes (for best flavor, onions must brown but not burn). Add curry powder and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds or so; add nuts and cook, stirring occasionally, for about a minute.</p>
        <p>2. Add coconut milk. Stir, bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium. Add tofu, stir and let tofu heat through for about 3 minutes. Stir in soy, then taste and adjust seasoning with soy, salt and/or cayenne as necessary. Serve over white rice.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
