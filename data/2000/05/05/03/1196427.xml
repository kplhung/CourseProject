        <p>POUNDCAKE is like brownies: a baker's challenge that sounds like child's play. The name itself is traditionally half the recipe -- a pound each of butter, eggs, sugar and flour -- but the technique is critical to producing a cake that is so tender it can stand alone but is still sturdy enough to hold up under a fruit compote, ice cream or sauce.</p>
        <p>Chefs around New York all have their own secrets to perfecting poundcake, which is turning up on menus with all manner of fruit. Because traditional poundcakes have no leavening like baking powder or baking soda, their lightness comes from beating air into the batter. Classic recipes call for beating together butter and sugar until they are fluffy, but the trick is not to overbeat, which heats the butter and makes the cake greasy.</p>
        <p>Michael Haimowitz at Morrell Wine Bar and Cafe uses half shortening, which makes the batter easier to whip so that it reaches a perfect consistency before the butter has a chance to break down. It also creates a lighter poundcake as moist as chiffon cake, which is made with oil. It works well as a base for a compote of dried mixed fruit, like apricots, figs, cherries, cranberries and currants, marinated in muscat.</p>
        <p>Using less butter, though, means less buttery flavor. Steven Picker, the chef at Good in Greenwich Village, uses all butter in his coconut poundcake (served with caramel ice cream and caramelized bananas) but takes extra care with it.</p>
        <p>''After making hundreds of poundcakes, I guess I discovered what everyone ends up discovering,'' he said. ''The two most important things seem to be the temperature of the ingredients, which should be at room temperature, and the amount of time you beat the butter and sugar.'' If the butter is at the right temperature, it usually takes three to four minutes of beating with the sugar in an electric mixer to get it airy and creamy enough to leaven the cake.</p>
        <p>Joseph Murphy, pastry chef at Gotham Bar and Grill, uses another technique, similar to the preparation of a genoise, for the almond poundcake he serves with strawberry-rhubarb compote, roasted strawberries and sour cream ice cream. He melts the butter first, beats eggs and sugar together until they are very thick, then whisks in cake flour, almond flour and the butter. Although the proportions are the same as for any other poundcake, the result is almost spongy, with a fine crumb.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy's variation might be too weightless for poundcake enthusiasts who like the traditional chewiness. They might prefer Sarabeth Levine's cakes at Sarabeth's in the Chelsea Market, in chocolate, lemon, poppy seed and other flavors.</p>
        <p>''A good poundcake can be dense and light at the same time,'' she said. And so for many of her cakes she uses a high-fat cultured dairy product, like sour cream or cream cheese, which adds even more butterfat to the recipe. More butter, she explained, ''would just make it feel greasy.'' She also prefers superfine sugar, which dissolves faster than granulated sugar and adds to the moistness of the cake.</p>
        <p>As light as they are, the results bear out her warning: ''You never want to use the word fluffy with a poundcake.''</p>
        <p>TOASTED-ALMOND POUNDCAKE WITH PAN-ROASTED STRAWBERRIES  AND STRAWBERRY-RHUBARB COMPOTE</p>
        <p>Adapted from Gotham Bar and Grill Time: 1 hour 20 minutes</p>
        <p>1 cup (2 sticks) plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter  5 large eggs  1 3/4 cups sugar, plus more to taste  1 1/3 cups almond flour  1 1/4 cups cake flour  1 teaspoon grated tangerine zest  2 tablespoons sliced almonds  3 pints strawberries, hulled  4 cups trimmed, sliced rhubarb.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour a loaf pan. In a small saucepan, melt butter. Set aside to cool.</p>
        <p>2. Using an electric mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat eggs and 1 cup sugar until thick and pale, about 3 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. In a bowl, sift together almond flour, cake flour and zest. Fold  1/3 of the flour mixture into eggs until thoroughly combined. Fold in rest of flour in 2 batches. Fold in all but 2 tablespoons of the melted butter. Scrape batter into pan, and sprinkle almonds on top. Brush remaining butter over almonds.</p>
        <p>4. Bake cake until a tester inserted into the middle comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. If the top of the cake seems to be getting overly browned before the center is set, cover with foil and continue baking. Let cool on a rack before inverting.</p>
        <p>5. Meanwhile, make the compote. In a medium saucepan, combine 1 pint of the strawberries, the rhubarb,  3/4 cup sugar and  1/4 cup water. Bring mixture to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until fruit breaks down into a puree. Let mixture cool, then taste and add more sugar if desired.</p>
        <p>6. Just before serving, place remaining strawberries in a large skillet, and sprinkle with sugar to taste. Cook strawberries over high heat until they release their juices and sugar dissolves. Serve slices of the poundcake surrounded by strawberry-rhubarb compote and topped with strawberries.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 servings.</p>
        <p>VANILLA BEAN POUNDCAKE WITH MUSCAT-MACERATED FRUIT</p>
        <p>Adapted from Morrell Wine Bar and Cafe Time: 90 minutes</p>
        <p>1/2 cup butter, at room temperature</p>
        <p>1/2 cup shortening, at room temperature  1 cup sugar  4 large eggs</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
        <p>1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and center scraped with tip of a knife  1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>3/4 teaspoons salt  Muscat-macerated fruit (see recipe).</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour a loaf pan. Using an electric mixer, cream butter, shortening and sugar until very fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk together eggs, vanilla extract and vanilla bean scrapings (reserve bean for fruit sauce). Gradually add egg mixture to butter mixture, beating well.</p>
        <p>2. Sift together flour and salt. Add half the flour mixture to batter, and beat to combine. Add remaining flour, gently folding it in with a spatula. Scrape batter into prepared pan, and smooth the top.</p>
        <p>3. Bake cake until a tester inserted into middle comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. If top of cake seems to be getting overly browned before center is set, cover with foil, and continue baking. Let cool on a rack before inverting.</p>
        <p>4. Serve slices of poundcake topped with macerated fruit.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 to 10 servings.</p>
        <p>MUSCAT-MACERATED FRUIT</p>
        <p>Time: 10 minutes, plus cooling time</p>
        <p>1 1/4 cups mixed dried fruit, like apricots, figs, cherries, cranberries and currants</p>
        <p>3/4 cup muscat wine, like Beaumes-de-Venise  2 tablespoons honey  3 allspice berries  1 cinnamon stick  1 vanilla bean (saved from cake recipe).</p>
        <p>1. In a small saucepan, combine all ingredients with  3/4 cup water. Bring mixture to a simmer, and cook for 2 minutes, stirring to dissolve sugar.</p>
        <p>2. Turn off heat, and let mixture cool. Remove vanilla bean and spices before serving.</p>
        <p>Yield: 3 cups.</p>
