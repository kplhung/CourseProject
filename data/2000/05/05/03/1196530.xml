        <p>Federal agents have broken up a cocaine ring that had been operating in New York City for 15 years and that used the attendants and dark corners of Midtown Manhattan parking garages to transfer millions of dollars in drug proceeds from one courier's car to another, the authorities said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The ring, which United States Customs Service investigators estimate smuggled about a ton of cocaine a month into New York from Bogota, was the longest running such operation in memory, and one of the larger ones, officials said.</p>
        <p>The customs service's El Dorado Task Force, a multi-agency group that focuses largely on money laundering cases, arrested 15 members of the ring on Monday and seized 2,500 pounds of cocaine and $730,000 in cash at an old textile warehouse at 236 Greenpoint Avenue in Brooklyn, officials said.</p>
        <p>''This was a major blow to traffickers who, for the last 15 years, used New York City as a discount warehouse for cocaine,'' said Raymond W. Kelly, the commissioner of the Customs Service.</p>
        <p>Officials attributed the ring's longevity to intricate counter-surveillance techniques, like routine money transfers in which two couriers would park their cars in a garage on West 46th Street and the Avenue of the Americas, where they were required to leave their keys with the attendant. After both couriers left, the attendant would move the money from one car's trunk to the other, officials said.</p>
        <p>The couriers knew that any federal agents following them would be reluctant to drive into the garage, because the attendant would see radios and other law enforcement equipment in their cars, revealing them as the authorities, an official said.</p>
        <p>The ring also had in place a warning signal involving one courier's pet Maltese, according to the official. If the courier, a Colombian woman identified in court papers as Monica Velilla-Almazan, showed up without her dog, Papo, it meant that she was under surveillance, the official said.</p>
        <p>The signal was never used, but customs agents learned about it, the garage transfers and other details of the operation from Ms. Velilla-Almazan, who began cooperating with federal authorities after her arrest April 6 on money laundering charges, according to court papers and officials. In addition, Ms. Velilla-Almazan secretly recorded conversations with key players in the ring, according to court papers.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the courier began cooperating, the task force, along with investigators from the Waterfront Commission began following members of the ring and learned of an impending shipment of more than a ton of cocaine, officials said. Investigators said they believed the drugs were smuggled into the country through Mexico.</p>
        <p>Fourteen people were arraigned Monday and yesterday on narcotics conspiracy and money laundering charges in federal court, and another person will be arraigned within a few weeks, said a spokesman for Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, whose office is prosecuting the case.</p>
        <p>The man suspected of leading the ring in New York, Hernan Barona Dorado, is being sought as a fugitive, and prosecutors are working with the Colombian authorities to bring charges against the man they say is the leader of the Colombian end of the ring, Ramon Orozco.</p>
