        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Bad Guys Are Always With Us'' (Op-Ed, April 30): Ronald Steel has revealed our Achilles' heel in the conduct of foreign affairs. We have failed miserably in our attempts to deal with authoritarian governments that do not respond as we desire to our threats, economic or military.</p>
        <p>Since the leaders of these countries do not want what we think they should want, we wind up tilting at windmills, creations of our own erroneous assessments. Proclamations of the need for them to follow the ''rule of law'' and moralizing about ''human rights'' have no effect except to make us feel moral and superior.</p>

        <p>It is hubris for politicians and the media constantly to proclaim that we are the world's only superpower. The limitations of power are all too obvious.</p>
