        <p>Opera fans who showed up at the Manhattan School of Music for the first of three performances of Domenico Cimarosa's comic opera ''Il Matrimonio Segreto'' were greeted by a large group of protesters at the entrance to the school on Broadway and 122nd Street.</p>
        <p>Those Morningside Heights residents oppose the school's plan to erect a 21-story building for dormitory facilities, practice rooms and a recital hall -- all critically needed, the school says. The pickets, carrying signs that read ''It's your aria, but our area!'' and other rallying cries, assert that the building would obscure Grant's Tomb, overshadow Sakura Park, dwarf the Gothic towers of Union Theological Seminary and loom over Riverside Church.</p>
        <p>The school's contention that it offers a valuable cultural resource to the community was borne out last Wednesday night with its charming production of the Cimarosa opera. This is exactly what a music school should be doing: presenting committed performances of deserving works that professional institutions, with their minds fixed on the bottom line, tend to ignore.</p>
        <p>Cimarosa was born seven years before Mozart, died 10 years after him and enjoyed far more public success. Of his 65 operas, ''Il Matrimonio Segreto'' was the best regarded in his day. Within eight years of its dazzling 1792 premiere, the work was performed 70 times throughout Europe. Yet today the opera is not often presented, which is inexplicable, for it is a delightful and, at least in this sensitive production, affecting work.</p>
        <p>With a witty libretto by Giovanni Bertati, the opera is a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of keeping secrets. Paolino, an efficient secretary to Signor Geronimo, a successful businessman in Bologna, has been secretly married for several months to his employer's younger daughter, Carolina. The furtive young couple hope that a plan to have Count Robinson marry Geronimo's elder daughter, Elisetta, will placate the ambitious father, who aspires to the nobility. Naturally, complications ensue, not the least of which is that the widowed Geronimo's sister, Fidalma, is all aflutter with love for young Paolino, and when the count shows up he is immediately taken with the wrong sister, Carolina.</p>
        <p>Whereas Mozart filled his opera scores with elegant and ingenious intricacies that he hoped would engage his audience, Cimarosa worked contentedly within the popular styles of his day. This is not to slight the skill and imagination of the music. Cimarosa had an impressive gift for melody and was adept at writing complex vocal ensembles, in which characters move on and off the stage and get in and out of trouble as the music just keeps going along. He also had a keen sense of musical humor: overly elaborate vocal lines that are meant to be funny; sudden tongue-in-cheek shifts into minor mode when a plot twist turns distressful. The conductor, Bart Folse, captured these qualities in this ebullient, well-played performance.</p>
        <p>A cast of attractive and talented young singers has been directed with stylish vitality by Albert Sherman. For the opera to come off as more than just a frothy comedy, the audience must believe in the plight of the smitten young couple. This was established beautifully when the curtain went up in Act I to reveal the handsome newlyweds -- Arden Kaywin, a bright-voice soprano, as Carolina and James Schaffner, a light, lyric tenor, as Paolino -- in bed and half undressed. A night of covert love-making is over; another day of exhausting deception has begun.</p>
        <p>As Geronimo, Bert K. Johnson, a bass, never overplayed the running joke of his character: the elderly man is hard of hearing. It was hilarious, but also rather touching, to see him all befuddled when everyone around him starts singing at once and he can't make out a word. Danielle Hermon, a soprano, brought buxom earthiness to the role of Elisetta, so helplessly attracted to the square-jawed, dashing Count Robinson, played by Dominic Aquilino, a baritone. And Sahoko Sato, a mezzo-soprano, made Fidalma a sympathetic character despite her foolish crush on a younger man.</p>
        <p>The costumes and sets were colorful and cheery. The opera was sung in Italian with projected supertitles. But even if it had been performed in translation, it could not have been more dramatically immediate.</p>
