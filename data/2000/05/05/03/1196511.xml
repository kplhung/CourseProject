        <p>The surge in sharing and trading music over the Internet has brought online music sites into conflict with record labels, which say copyrighted songs are being pirated. Today the dispute is expected to take a significant turn that will pit musicians directly against their fans.</p>
        <p>The heavy-metal band Metallica will seek to prevent 335,000 fans from using  Napster, a service for sharing music collections over the Internet. A lawyer for the band said the users, identified by their online handles, were making Metallica recordings available for others to copy.</p>
        <p>Napster officials said yesterday that under the law they would be obliged to bar anyone shown to have infringed copyright from using the service, though it was not clear what might prevent such users from reregistering.</p>
        <p>In any case, the move is a potential blow to the explosively popular but embattled Napster, which was created last year and already faces several lawsuits. The Metallica lawyer said that if the tactic succeeded, he would encourage similar moves by other musicians, thus potentially depriving Napster of thousands of users.</p>
        <p>And with the musicians moving directly into the fray, the dispute is no longer between faceless record labels and Internet companies.</p>
        <p>Already, tempers are flaring, with fans of Metallica, one of the most popular heavy metal bands of the last two decades, asserting the move may cause them to abandon a band they have followed with dogged loyalty. ''There are going to be Metallica CD burnings if they try this,'' said Rob Jones, founder of KNAC.com, a Web site catering to heavy-metal fans.</p>
        <p>But Metallica sees the issue very differently, said its lawyer, Howard King. He said Metallica spent millions of dollars to create and market an album and did not want to have the music traded freely online, depriving the band of the fruits of its investment.</p>
        <p>''The band would like to sell some albums,'' Mr. King said.</p>
        <p>He added that ''it is a lousy position to be in'' for Metallica to be at odds with its fans. But he said that Napster has put Metallica in the position and forced the band to ''take a stand.'' That stand entailed hiring a company to visit Napster to compile a log of the online handles of Napster users who say they have Metallica music to offer.</p>
        <p>Mr. King said he planned to hand over the list of names to Napster, which is based in San Mateo, Calif., in a collection of documents filling 30 cardboard boxes. His plans were reported yesterday by Cnet.com, an Internet news site.</p>
        <p>Computer users who download the Napster software can then use the Napster site to list the music stored on their computers. By so doing, they offer that music to the other Napster users, who in effect visit one another's computers over the Internet and listen to or download music.</p>
        <p>Napster officials assert they are not involved in music piracy because the music is not kept on the company's computers. Further, they say their users must comply with copyright law. Elizabeth Brooks, vice president for marketing at Napster, said the company would expel users found to be ''legitimate infringers'' of copyright.</p>
        <p>She said the company was obliged to take the step under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which stipulates that an online service is liable for copyright infringement if it is warned that a user is infringing a copyright and fails to act.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brooks said the 335,000 fans represented less than 10 percent of  Napster's ''several million'' users.  She declined to say how much music is available for trading through the service.</p>
        <p>Until last week, when Metallica and the rapper Dr. Dre sued Napster for copyright infringement, the battle had been waged primarily by the music companies' trade group, the Recording Industry Association of America. On another front in the digital music struggle, the industry won at least an initial victory last week when a federal judge ruled that another online music database, MP3.com, had violated copyright law.</p>
        <p>Cliff Burnstein, one of Metallica's managers, said the band decided it needed to join the fight to make it clear that the dispute is not just about the interests of the record companies, but about the bands themselves.</p>
        <p>''Even though the R.I.A.A. sued, they did it in a legalistic manner that didn't bring a lot of coverage,'' he said. ''We though this would bring the issue out more if we did it.''</p>
        <p>Any rift between Metallica and its fans over Napster would be particularly striking since the band's initial popularity in the early 1980's grew in part from a cassette demo tape, ''No Life Til Leather,'' that the band sent out free and encouraged fans to bootleg. It is said to be among the most-traded cassette demo tapes in rock.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burnstein said the band had a right to distribute music free then, but also had the right to ask for payment from fans for its current CD's. It now records for Elektra Records, a division of Time Warner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones of KNAC.com said music fans did not feel they were costing the bands money by sharing music online. Rather, he said, those who have routinely copied music for each other on cassette tapes, or made illegal bootleg recordings at concerts, are merely taking the practice to a new medium.</p>
        <p>He said Metallica had lost touch with its fans. ''They're the No. 1 fan of George Washington,'' he said, referring to the president on the one-dollar bill. ''They're just being the man,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 4, 2000, Thursday  A picture caption in Business Day yesterday about an effort by the heavy-metal band Metallica to prevent 335,000 fans from using Napster, a service for sharing music collections over the Internet, misspelled the surname of a band member. He is James Hetfield, not Hatfield.</p>
