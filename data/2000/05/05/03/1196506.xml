        <p>Despite spending more than $2 billion over two decades to improve education and attract more white students, the Kansas City School District has essentially been judged a failure by a state education review board, which has denied it accreditation.</p>
        <p>With the loss of state accreditation on Monday, public schools in Kansas City, Mo., took another blow to its battered image. Despite long and ambitious efforts stemming from a 1977 desegregation lawsuit, it remains a district where about 75 percent of its students are members of racial minorities and where test scores remain low.</p>
        <p>The Missouri Board of Education removed the status of accreditation after the Kansas City schools failed to meet any of 11 performance standards.</p>
        <p>Benjamin Demps Jr., the superintendent of schools, vowed earlier this week to aggressively win back accreditation, saying, ''We have been preparing to face the challenge it brings.''</p>
        <p>He said the district had seen improvements in the attendance rate lately and had already begun several new strategies at improving education, including a move for more demanding standards on literacy.</p>
        <p>The problems of the Kansas City schools, and the long court remedies designed to improve education and more fully integrate the schools,  have long been a centerpiece in the national debate over race, test scores and the competing notions of raising academic achievement.</p>
        <p>The loss of accreditation means the district has two years to raise test scores, improve graduation rates and make progress in other areas or face the prospect of a takeover by the state.</p>
        <p>The action by the state board also means that children in the Kansas City School District can leave for suburban schools, and that the Kansas City District would be forced to pay tuition and transportation costs.</p>
        <p>The loss of accreditation came as no surprise. The board decided last fall to strip the status from the Kansas City District, effective May 1.</p>
        <p>''We have known this day was coming since last November,'' Mr. Demps said on Monday, promising improvement.</p>
        <p>Gwen Grant, an executive vice president of the Urban League in Kansas City, expressed concern that a ''panic environment'' would lead many parents to withdraw their children from the city's schools.</p>
        <p>Acknowledging that serious problems endure in the district, Ms. Grant said the state could have aggressively demanded improvements without deeming the district a failure.</p>
        <p>Ms. Grant said that while the school district had spent lavishly on new facilities and had instituted programs like those at a Greek studies magnet school, designed largely to attract suburban students, not enough attention has been paid to basic learning in the classroom.</p>
        <p>The district has used magnet schools since 1985, allowing certain schools to concentrate on special disciplines, a system that was intended to increase the number of suburban students volunteering to attend the city schools. Of the 37,000 students in the Kansas City District, about 2,000 live in the suburbs.</p>
        <p>Clinton Adams, whose daughter will graduate from a Kansas City high school this year, blamed the district for putting too much emphasis on the racial makeup of the schools, rather than concentrating on academic standards.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adams, a lawyer who is black, said greater racial integration would have come naturally if the district had focused more keenly on making the schools better, regardless of the racial makeup.</p>
        <p>The decision to remove accreditation, he said, is ''stigmatizing and embarrassing to students and staff at the schools.''</p>
        <p>Last November, a federal judge dismissed the desegregation suit, saying the district had done all it could to end racial segregation. But an appeals court reinstated the case in January, noting enduring gaps between white and black students on test scores.</p>
        <p>The district failed each of 11 performance indicators, including test scores, dropout rate and attendance.</p>
        <p>Not all of the Kansas City schools are failing. The district's college preparatory school, in fact, has some of the best test scores in the state.</p>
        <p>Many Republicans in Missouri have long been critics of the Kansas City School District, complaining that it was receiving a disproportionate share of state money.</p>
        <p>A proposed bill in the Missouri Legislature would split the district into five smaller units. Proponents of the measure say smaller schools would be easier to manage.</p>
        <p>State Representative Carson Ross, a Republican, noted that the two biggest districts in the state, Kansas City and St. Louis, had the most severe problems.</p>
        <p>The Kansas City District has also been forced to compete with a growing number of charter schools, which are run independently. Some 15 charter schools now operate in Kansas City, with requests pending for two more in the next academic year.</p>
