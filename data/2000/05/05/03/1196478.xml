        <p>EUGENE M. LANG broke new ground in philanthropy in 1981 by offering all sixth graders at East Harlem's Public School 121 a college scholarship if they graduated from high school.</p>

        <p>Scholarships for Future Scientists</p>
        <p>EUGENE M. LANG broke new ground in philanthropy in 1981 by offering all sixth graders at East Harlem's Public School 121 a college scholarship if they graduated from high school.</p>
        <p>Last Friday, Mr. Lang  was at it again, this time at the American Museum of Natural History, where a group of inner-city seventh graders were shouting aloud with him, ''I will be a scientist.''</p>
        <p>He has given $1 million to make the 10 youngsters the first members of a museum science team.</p>
        <p>The students will spend many Saturdays in the coming years in the museum's research program, working closely with curators. Those who complete the program will get a college scholarship and each year another 10 seventh graders will be added.</p>
        <p>Rutgers Picks Chief of Arts School</p>
        <p>Rutgers University has chosen GEORGE B. STAUFFER, chairman of the music department at Hunter College, to become dean of the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers in August.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stauffer, an organist and Bach scholar, will replace MARILYN F. SOMVILLE, who is retiring as dean of the 700-student arts school. Founded in 1976, it offers graduate programs in music, theater and visual arts, and undergraduate programs in those disciplines plus dance.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stauffer said one of his top priorities was to build up an independent, multimillion-dollar endowment for the school. Another is to attract more students from around the country; more than 90 percent are now from New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Before arriving at Hunter, Dr. Stauffer taught at Yeshiva University and at Columbia University, where he was university organist and chapel music director for 22 years.</p>
        <p>New York Schools in Need of Repair</p>
        <p>A new study by the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers' union, put New York State at the top of the list of states that need to repair their schools or modernize them with new technology.</p>
        <p>The study, released today, said the total repair bill for the nation's schools should be $322 billion.</p>
        <p>Of that total, $51 billion is needed in New York, $32.9 billion in California,  $25.1 billion in Ohio and $22 billion in New Jersey, the study said.</p>
        <p>The $322 billion is 10 times what states are now spending, the report said.</p>
        <p>''We often fail to realize that where our students learn can have a dramatic impact on what they learn,'' said BOB CHASE, the association's president.</p>
        <p>University Moves Graduate Students</p>
        <p>After 24 years at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, Long Island University is moving its Westchester campus for graduate students to the State University at Purchase.</p>
        <p>At Purchase, the students will have a 15,000-square-foot space with 14 classrooms wired for the Internet and two computer labs. The two institutions will remain separate, but students will be able to share library access online.</p>
        <p>Economics Chair at Manhattanville</p>
        <p>Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y., will create the first endowed professorial chair in its 159-year-old history with a $1 million contribution from SERGIO DANGUILLECOURT, a director of the board of Bacardi Ltd. The chair will be known as the Ryan-Bacardi chair of economics, after Bacardi and Prof. EDWARD W. RYAN, who has taught at Manhattanville for 42 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Danguillecourt, who lives in Miami, graduated from Manhattanville in 1990 with a degree in economics.</p>
