        <p>The Unisys Corporation is evaluating its relationship with the Bozell Group after eight years. Billings for the account of Unisys, a computer services supplier, were estimated at $20 million.</p>
        <p>Richard Badler, a spokesman for Unisys in Blue Bell, Pa., confirmed a report of the re-evaluation this week in Advertising Age. The reason was a decision last week by a competitor of Unisys, the Compaq Computer Corporation, to hire FCB Worldwide as its agency; FCB and Bozell are both owned by True North Communications. Unisys will soon decide whether that represents a conflict, Mr. Badler said.</p>
