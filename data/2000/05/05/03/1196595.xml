        <p>A state judge drastically reduced bail for a robbery suspect yesterday after the authorities were unable to prove that he was involved in the death of a man who was about to testify against him at trial.</p>
        <p>The judge, Yvonne Lewis of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, ordered the bail for the suspect, David Trumpet, to be decreased to $50,000 from $750,000. While she acknowledged that Mr. Trumpet was ''the prime suspect'' in the death of the witness, Kelly Marcelus, Justice Lewis said the purpose of bail was not to detain people who are merely suspected of a crime.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trumpet, 32, was charged last May with thrusting a gun into Mr. Marcelus's face, beating him and stealing his wallet as Mr. Marcelus delivered a pizza to Mr. Trumpet's home in East Flatbush. But last week, after the police discovered Mr. Marcelus's burned and decapitated body wrapped up in a roll of carpet in a parking garage in Queens, Mr. Trumpet was returned to jail in lieu of $750,000 bail.</p>
