        <p>In a speech pungent with tough talk about criminals, drug abusers and his Republican rival for president, Vice President Al Gore called today for a broad array of anticrime measures, among them mandatory drug testing of all prisoners and parolees.</p>
        <p>Choosing a Southern state as the backdrop for one of his most conservative speeches of the presidential campaign, Mr. Gore proposed federal spending of $500 million a year  to help states test, treat and counsel  prisoners and parolees for drug use.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, inmates in state prisons -- mandatory drug testing already applies in federal prisons --  would not be released until they could pass drug tests. Further, parolees could be returned to prison if they failed the tests, which would be administered to them twice a week.  Parolees would also be subjected to stricter supervision, to ensure that they paid child support, stayed off drugs and found jobs.</p>
        <p>''When inmates are sent back to the streets unrehabilitated, unrepentant and unskilled, then they are just going to commit more crime and go right back into prison,'' Mr. Gore said to a crowd filled with uniformed police officers.</p>
        <p>As in all his recent policy speeches, the vice president used a harsh tone to attack Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the apparent Republican presidential nominee, this time maintaining that he had cut state financing of drug treatment by half.</p>
        <p>As a result of such policies, Mr. Gore said, Texas under Mr. Bush has experienced a 25 percent increase in the number of former inmates returned to prison for new crimes within three years of release.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore did not suggest that Mr. Bush had been soft on crime, a position that would be hard to defend: in Mr. Bush's five and a half years as governor, Texas has undertaken the nation's largest prison-building program, executed a record number of criminals, lengthened sentences for many crimes and incarcerated a rising number of juveniles.</p>
        <p>But the vice president did say: ''I believe that we should demand that criminals get clean before they get out of jail. Governor Bush seems content to keep pushing them out of the same revolving door.''</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Bush disputed Mr. Gore's statistic on Texas recidivism and his accusation that the governor had cut financing of drug treatment. They also said violent crime in the state had fallen 20 percent, to a 20-year low, during the Bush administration. And they asserted that the availability of drug treatment in federal prisons had declined during the Clinton-Gore administration, even as  drug use among adolescents had risen (an assertion disputed in turn by the Gore campaign).</p>
        <p>''If Al Gore is willing to attack Texas, where violent crime is at a 20-year low and the largest prison drug-treatment program in the country is located, we're also expecting attacks on Texans for defending the Alamo,'' said Dan Bartlett, a Bush aide.</p>
        <p>Just as Mr. Bush has tried to move further to the center of the political spectrum with education and health care proposals, Mr. Gore's crime speech today provided him an opportunity to reach out to centrist Republicans and conservative Democrats. And he seized it with gusto.</p>
        <p>He cited the Bible several times, illustrating the problem of violence among young men by retelling the story of Cain and Abel. He argued that no amount of anticrime legislation would work unless people took greater responsibility for their actions. And he castigated both conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats for failing to compromise on crime-fighting plans, casting himself as the purveyor of a third way who could rise above ''old orthodoxies.''</p>
        <p>''We can't go back to the finger-pointing and failed strategies that led to that steep increase in crime in the Bush-Quayle administration,'' he said. ''And we can't go back to the old Democratic approach, which was tough on the causes of crime but not tough enough on crime itself, again when people in both political parties wanted us to do more.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's effort to outflank Governor Bush on crime recalls Bill Clinton's drive in the 1992 campaign to neutralize what had been a potent Republican issue by advocating tough anticrime measures, including the death penalty.</p>
        <p>The vice president's speech today, typifying the administration's approach to policy making, offered a mixture of ideas -- some new, some old, many small-bore. Several of the ideas were first discussed by Mr. Gore in a crime speech last July in Boston, where he called for longer sentences for all crimes committed with guns and for requiring photo-bearing licenses for people who buy new handguns.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Gore restated his support for a proposal that federal money help local governments hire 50,000 new police officers in the coming decade. The Clinton administration has already helped finance the hiring of 60,000 new police officers, with 40,000 more in the pipeline.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also proposed aid to help state and local governments buy computers for crime-fighting purposes, hire new prosecutors and expand after-school programs.</p>
        <p>And in addition to mandatory drug testing of prisoners and parolees, he called for expanding drug treatment programs for noncriminals, though he offered no details. ''I believe we should build a country in which every single addict who finds the power to reach out and say, 'Now is the time I want help and I want treatment' gets an immediate response,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also jumped into what has become a contentious debate in Congress by endorsing a constitutional amendment to expand the rights of crime victims. The amendment would grant victims and their families the right to reasonable notice of court proceedings involving their cases, the right to have a voice in those proceedings, and the right to notice of an offender's release or escape from prison.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the amendment, including many Democrats, assert that those rights can be ensured  without amending the Constitution. In addition, some liberals argue that the measure would violate the civil rights of the accused.</p>
        <p>In His Own Words  AL GORE</p>
        <p>Speaking yesterday about crime in Atlanta, as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>''I pledge to you that if I am entrusted with the presidency, I will launch a sweeping anticrime strategy to make our families safe and secure. I will intensify the battle against crime, drugs and disorder in our communities. . . .</p>
        <p>As crime and fear grew, too many families became afraid to live up to their own responsibilities and help take back their communities from the thugs and the dealers. And too many criminals saw the disorder on our streets as an invitation to further lawlessness and violence. . . .</p>
        <p>Seven years ago, we began to change all that. President Clinton and I thought we needed a tougher and more comprehensive strategy to fight crime on every single front. Smarter prevention to stop crime before it even started. More police on our streets to thicken the thin blue line between order and disorder. And tougher punishments, including the death penalty for those who dared to penalize the innocent.''</p>
