        <p>Joe: I've been traveling in sales jobs for 27 years. I'm on the road most of the time. I don't think I could take a job that didn't involve travel now. It gets in your blood.</p>
        <p>Dave: I go on most trips with Joe to train the salespeople.</p>
        <p>Joe: On a flight back to New York from California, there was a burning odor. The pilot turned the plane around and told us not to be upset at the fire trucks that would be waiting for us. We hopped on a second plane and had the time of our lives in the last row playing cards with a guy from our human resources department. We were trying to figure out how to keep track and play for money but we had no chips, so a flight attendant gave us about 30 swizzle sticks.</p>
        <p>Dave: I won $119 from Joe in that game.</p>
        <p>Joe: The whole time we were playing we were talking business. We're hiring two training people, and we couldn't agree on a job description or who they would report to. Dave acted as mediator, pointing out some things we hadn't thought about. I'm 53, and he's 30. We get along well. It's rare to find an information-services guy who has a sales personality. We have fun, but we're dead serious about what we do.</p>
        <p>Dave: I got engaged on that trip. My girlfriend came out on Friday, before the Sunday sales meeting, and I chartered a boat for a cruise. As the sun went down, I got down on one knee and proposed. On the way to another meeting, I loaded a new casino game on my laptop. Joe and I started playing in the airport, listened to voice mail on our cell phones while we were playing, and continued the game on the plane.</p>
        <p>Joe: The flight attendants even got into it -- each time they'd pass us they'd check to see who was winning.</p>
        <p>Dave: I was bragging because I was winning, but then Joe hit a hot streak. We were yelling at each other about the game -- we instigate each other -- but like always, we were carrying on two conversations at once. I was trying to make Joe understand how our e-business initiative could help his salespeople. I needed his buy-in so he'd take it to upper management.</p>
        <p>Joe: Our in-house travel agent can't believe how many hours we work when we're on the road. Recently I attended three different regional sales meetings in the United States, came home, and then went to Mexico, all within three weeks.</p>
        <p>After a flight where we lost an engine, I returned to the office to find phone messages from my co-workers joking that they weren't going to fly with me again. I sent a group message back saying: ''You know you are. If you don't fly with me anymore, you're not going to have any fun.''</p>
