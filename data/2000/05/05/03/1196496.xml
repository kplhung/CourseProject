      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Bosko Radonjich has slipped out of plenty of tight corners during his days as an alleged associate of the New York mob and, by his account, as a Serbian freedom fighter with ties to Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader accused of war crimes.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Radonjich avoided what was probably his closest call yet yesterday when the federal government decided not to prosecute him on charges of fixing a 1987 racketeering trial. The prosecutors decided that because an important witness against Mr. Radonjich, Salvatore Gravano, was arrested on drug charges earlier this year, his testimony would not be credible.</p>
        <p>In papers filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, the government insisted that Mr. Radonjich was guilty of tampering with a juror in an effort to throw the first federal trial of John J. Gotti, the former Gambino family crime boss. Mr. Gotti was acquitted in 1987 and convicted in 1992 on racketeering and murder charges.</p>
        <p>But the prosecutors conceded that their ability to try Mr. Radonjich had been ''adversely affected by several factors,'' including the arrest of Mr. Gravano, sometimes known as Sammy the Bull, a killer for the Gambino family who turned federal informer.</p>
        <p>The case against Mr. Radonjich, a Yugoslav immigrant and onetime Manhattan parking lot owner, had been scheduled to open with jury selection on April 3 when Mr. Gravano was arrested in Arizona on Feb. 24. He was charged by local officials with helping to mastermind a multimillion-dollar drug ring in Phoenix and its suburbs with members of a white-supremacist youth gang.</p>
        <p>The prosecution had wanted Mr. Gravano as a witness in the Radonjich case because, at another Gotti trial in 1992, he had testified that he gave Mr. Radonjich $60,000 with which to bribe a juror, George Pape, in Mr. Gotti's 1987 trial. In 1987, the authorities said, Mr. Radonjich headed the Westies, a Hell's Kitchen gang that often carried out the Gambino family's demands.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pape, a longtime friend of Mr. Radonjich's, was later convicted in the case and was sentenced to three years in prison. Mr. Radonjich fled the country and remained a fugitive for nearly eight years.</p>
        <p>But on New Year's Day, he was arrested at the Miami airport when inspectors of the United States Customs Service happened across the old jury-tampering warrant.</p>
        <p>Lawrence Hochheiser, Mr. Radonjich's lawyer, said he was somewhat disappointed that the case had been dropped, adding that his client would have been exonerated had it gone to trial.</p>
        <p>''The government looked in Serbia, they looked all over the United States and they couldn't find one person to say anything about him except for Sammy Gravano,'' Mr. Hochheiser said. ''The government would like you to think that Sammy Gravano is unavailable, but he's not. He's undesirable. He's damaged goods.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Radonjich is still in custody and faces federal charges of giving a false address to the customs inspectors.</p>
        <p>According to law enforcement officials, when Mr. Radonjich was arrested, he was carrying pictures of military and diplomatic installations. They said he had pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in 1978 in connection with the bombing of the Yugoslav consul's home in a suburb of Chicago.</p>
