        <p>MANY restaurants today are aiming for the unusual with their wine lists. But that is not exactly what you get with the after-dinner wine list at Lupa. It's unusual, all right. But eccentric may be a more apt description.</p>
        <p>After a quick, tempting listing of predictable characters -- the ports, the grappas, the moscatos -- it lays out a large, strange territory devoted to amari, or bitters.</p>
        <p>The 15 names read more like the cast of an opera than a selection of after-dinner drinks. There is Mirto Tremontis, Maria al Monte, Branca Menta and Lucano.</p>
        <p>All are dark, dense, bitter digestifs, high in alcohol and flavored with extractions of everything from artichokes to walnuts. They are made all over Italy. There, they are routinely drunk to settle the stomach after too much pasta puttanesca or osso buco.</p>
        <p>But they are not the kind of thing most Americans warm up to on the first try. A list of 15 could be slow movers. Warren Fraser, Lupa's wine director, has a solution. Those comfortable with the punch of menthol delivered by the relatively familiar Fernet Branca can order a shot of it in a tall, narrow tumbler. Curious newcomers to this world of dark tonics can get a tasting of three. Waiters seem to have radar for such diners.</p>
        <p>My waiter brought the bottles to the table, turned them around and made me smell the dark liquors before tasting. They all looked like flat Coca-Cola. One smelled of chamomile, another of nuts and wintergreen, the third disturbingly of bubble gum. He then told me in which order to drink them, from the most gentle to the most assertive, much as you should when eating cheese. It helped. The chamomile-flavored amaro, Camomillina Colombo, was like a dewy herbal syrup; the nut one, Amaro Giuliari, was viscous and thick with competing flavors of Listerine, smoke and tar, and left a kind of oily sensation in the mouth; the bubble gum amaro, Casauria, was like sap. All were astonishingly light on the stomach. As they should be.</p>
        <p>There is a kind of magical quality about them. The real mystery, though, is how they are made.</p>
        <p>''The cool thing about amaro,'' Mr. Fraser said, ''is that no one knows. It's very secretive.'' Other digestifs like grappa, he said, are made by a straightforward distillation process. But a commercial amaro like Fernet Branca ''is made with like 35 different herbs, leaves, branches, God knows what,'' he said, adding: ''That is the mystique.''</p>
        <p>A single amaro is $6 to $7, a tasting of three is $10 at Lupa, 170 Thompson Street (Houston Street), (212) 982-5089.</p>
