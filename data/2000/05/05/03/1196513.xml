        <p>The Rev. Floyd H. Flake, the Queens minister and former congressman who has been widely talked about as a potential candidate for mayor of New York City, plans to announce today that he is joining Edison Schools Inc., the largest for-profit school-management company  in the country, education industry officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Flake is to head the company's charter school division.</p>
        <p>Edison has been one of the most aggressive entrepreneurs in the mushrooming field of charter schools, publicly financed schools that operate free of much of the authority of local school districts.  Mr. Flake has been a supporter of the schools, as well as an advocate of giving parents vouchers to send their children to private schools.</p>
        <p>Mr. Flake, a Democrat who has been a leading black supporter of conservative causes, particularly in education, will continue to serve as senior pastor of the Allen A.M.E. Church in Jamaica, Queens, the officials said.</p>
        <p>H. Christopher Whittle, the founder and president of Edison, and Benno C. Schmidt Jr., the chairman, are expected to announce the appointment of Mr. Flake this morning at a news conference at Edison's headquarters in Manhattan. Neither Mr. Flake nor Edison officials would  comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>The appointment is expected to remove Mr. Flake from the list of potential candidates for the mayoral election in November 2001. Though he is a Democrat, Mr. Flake had been courted as a mayoral candidate by state Republican leaders, who saw him as someone who could attract African-American voters to the party through his support of education reform. And he has long been familiar to Republican leaders, having endorsed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Gov. George E. Pataki and former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato in their campaigns for public office. Mr. Flake had told friends, however, that if he ran it would be as a Democrat.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Flake endorsed Al Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination in February, he has criticized the vice president's education policy, which opposes vouchers. Last October, Mr. Flake gave a warm introduction to George W. Bush, whom he referred to as ''my homeboy,'' at a meeting of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative advocacy group, at which Governor Bush outlined his education proposals.</p>
        <p>One education industry executive who spoke on condition of anonymity said Mr. Flake's job with Edison would not be merely a ceremonial one. Although both Mr. Whittle and Mr. Schmidt are familiar figures in both business and political circles, Mr. Flake is expected to become the company's most prominent public figure, promoting Edison's management program and curriculum to school board officials and talking about the benefits of charter schools to state and federal lawmakers.</p>
        <p>Edison operates 79 public schools with a total enrollment of 38,000 students in 16 states and 36 cities. Most are schools for which Edison has been given a management contract by a school district concerned about  a history of poor student performance. But about one-third of those are charter schools, in which Edison is accountable to a community sponsor chosen to start a school free of standard district rules.</p>
        <p>In November, Edison announced its largest contract to date, with the Dallas Independent School District, to serve 6,500 students next school year. Edison is scheduled to open its first charter school in New York State this fall, in Rochester.</p>
        <p>Edison is one of the largest publicly traded education companies, and its revenues have been growing quickly. They totaled $132 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 1999, up from $69 million the previous year. In the six months that ended Dec. 31, revenues grew to $102 million from $60 million in the same period a year earlier. But profits have been harder to come by; the company recorded net losses of $51 million last year and $21 million in the first six months of the current fiscal year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Flake's extensive contacts on both ends of the political spectrum testify to his philosophy of using his political power with both parties to gain economic clout for his church. The Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church, which says it has 12,000 members, is one of the largest churches in New York State, occupying a cavernous $23 million cathedral, which opened in 1997, on Merrick Boulevard in southeastern Queens.</p>
        <p>Although he runs only a small religious school, with 500 students from prekindergarten through 8th grade, Mr. Flake has vast business experience through Allen A.M.E.'s wide-ranging interests. The church has more than a dozen affiliated corporations, some of them operated for profit, with interests in housing, transportation and financial services.</p>
        <p>In 1997, Mr. Flake retired from Congress after 11 years, saying he wanted to spend more time tending his congregation. He has since been active in political circles as well as in education, and already has an association with Edison as well as some of its rival charter school companies.</p>
        <p>In March, he was appointed to an Edison advisory board. He also serves on a similar board for Victory Schools Inc., a small for-profit operator of charter schools in New York City. Mr. Flake is a director of the Children's Scholarship Fund, the philanthropic venture started by Ted Forstmann, the financier.</p>
        <p>Mr. Flake had recently considered starting his own charter school company to apply for the right to open new publicly financed schools in New York. As part of those deliberations, industry executives said, Mr. Flake was approached by Mr. Whittle about working for Edison.</p>
        <p>George Arzt, a Democratic political consultant and friend of Mr. Flake's, said that although many people in both major parties had asked Mr. Flake to explore a mayoral candidacy, he always said that if he ran it would be as a Democrat.</p>
        <p>''But he found at the end of an exploration period, after some time thinking about it, that he just didn't want to do it,'' Mr. Arzt said.</p>
