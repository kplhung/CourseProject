        <p>Jim Rogers, a horse and cattle rancher who was the last surviving child of the cowboy humorist Will Rogers, died on Friday at his home in Bakersfield, Calif. He was 84.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogers was also a consultant to three memorials to his father: the Will Rogers Memorial Museum in Claremore, Okla.; the ranch where his father was born, near Oologah, Okla.; and the Will Rogers State Historic Park in Pacific Palisades, Calif.</p>

        <p>He was born in New York, the third son and last child of Will Rogers and his wife, Betty. The family moved in 1919 to Southern California, where Jim Rogers attended Pomona College. He left school in 1935 after his father and Wiley Post were killed in a plane crash in Alaska.</p>
        <p>His brother Will Rogers Jr. died in 1993; his sister, Mary, died in 1989; and his brother Fred died in 1920.</p>
