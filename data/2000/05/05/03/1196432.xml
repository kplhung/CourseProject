        <p>What's new in potato chips? The color blue, a deep purply blue rimmed with lavender, in fact. They are from Olive Oil Potato Chips, which makes delicious crisp chips from potatoes fried in olive oil and seasoned with sea salt and rosemary, black pepper or garlic. The blue chips, made from blue potatoes, have an earthy flavor with hints of celery. Try them with a dip made with a half cup each of mayonnaise and plain yogurt. Add a large stalk of celery grated fine in a food processor, a tablespoon of minced dill and two to three tablespoons of prepared horseradish. This yields one and a half cups of dip, which should be enough for a five-ounce bag of the chips. The chips are $4.95 in many food shops.</p>
