        <p>MAHONEY-David J. The Board, Staff and entire membership of Research America honor the life of David J. Mahoney, Chairman and CEO of the Charles A. Dana Foundation.

We extend our condolences to his family. Honorable Paul G. Rogers, Chair Mary Woolley, President</p>
        <p>MAHONEY-David. The trustees, faculty, and staff of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory are deeply saddened at the death of David Mahoney.
