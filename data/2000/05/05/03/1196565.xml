        <p>As part of its efforts to halt a string of nine killings of livery drivers this year, the Police Department plans to have undercover detectives pose as drivers in a small number of livery cars equipped with hidden cameras, officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The department recently bought some Lincoln Town Cars, and a police official said yesterday that as many as 10 of the decoy cabs might be on the streets at any one time.</p>
        <p>The cars will be equipped with partitions, hidden cameras and audio recording devices, and teams of backup officers in several vehicles  will ride close to each decoy cab to protect the undercover officers, the official said.</p>
        <p>''People who are thinking about getting involved in criminal activity with livery drivers should know it's very possible you may be confronting a police officer,'' Commissioner Howard Safir said yesterday. ''We have a definitive plan,'' he added.</p>
        <p>He would not provide details of the program, which was reported yesterday in The New York Post.</p>
        <p>The decoy cabs are one of several measures recently announced by the police, who three times this year have expanded patrols aimed at halting the killings.</p>
        <p>Last month, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani created a $5 million city program to provide some of the city's 41,000 livery cabs with partitions and security cameras, and on  Monday city officials and Bell Atlantic announced that they would give livery-cab drivers cell phones programmed to dial 911.</p>
        <p>As the victim of the most recent killing was buried yesterday, the police reiterated their pleas to livery drivers to install partitions, and, if possible, security cameras, and not to pick up street hails, especially after midnight.</p>
        <p>The police cautioned drivers yesterday that some robbers were teaming up with women to try to catch drivers off guard.</p>
        <p>On Monday night, two young women robbed a medallion taxi driver at gunpoint on East 23rd Street in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A short time later, two women were arrested in the crime. Nancy Gonzalez, 17, and Dasha Sanchez, 19, both of the Bronx, were charged with first-degree robbery and criminal possession of a weapon.</p>
