        <p>It was not the spectacular golf course on a cove overlooking the Pacific Ocean that led Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania to fly here the other day to address a group of Republicans (though he did squeeze in a round before his speech). It was the chance to do something a politician rarely does: praise another politician more than himself. The object of his affection was Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Bill Richardson, the secretary of energy, cut short a visit to India for meetings on nuclear proliferation last October so he could be in New Hampshire to toss questions at Vice President Al Gore in preparation for his first debate with Bill Bradley. After only 28 hours in India, Mr. Richardson rushed to London and then flew to Boston, where a waiting Gore aide frantically drove him to Hanover, N.H., just in time to catch the vice president in the parking lot.</p>
        <p>In the shadow of the presidential jockeying, a second competition is well under way: for the spot as No. 2. Dozens of governors, senators, House members, Cabinet secretaries, business executives, retired politicians and maybe even a general are maneuvering behind the scenes to land on the candidates' purported (and perhaps mythical) short lists.</p>
        <p>They are also seeking to score points with Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore by stumping for them around the country, dispensing unsolicited political and policy tips and seizing every opportunity to say flattering things about their party's standard bearer. Mindful that they not appear unseemly, the one thing they dare not do is utter two words directly to the candidate: running mate.</p>
        <p>In fact, for many, the watchwords are deftness and subtlety. If you are caught looking as if you are actually campaigning, you may lose.</p>
        <p>Jack Kemp, the Republican vice presidential candidate in 1996 who did not lobby for the job, and, if anything, discouraged Bob Dole from picking him, cautioned those who want to be considered: ''Keep your mouth shut, your head down,  and don't act like you want it.''</p>
        <p>Heeding such advice, several politicians are keeping their mouths shut, at least publicly. But many certainly act as if they want the job. One big-name politician in Washington who is frequently mentioned as a possible vice presidential contender was eager in an interview to make the case for why he would be a fabulous choice. But he insisted that his name not be used.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to be quoted,'' he said conspiratorially. ''That would be a good way to get off the list.'' Boasting about his selling points, he said of the candidate, ''I won't say that I'm one of his good buddies, but I know him as well as anybody outside his close friends.''</p>
        <p>Another politician, a senator from a battleground state, was happy to offer reasons why the politician quoted in the previous paragraph would not be such a fabulous choice.</p>
        <p>''I don't think he brings anything to the campaign,'' the senator said. Then he offered himself as a possibility, saying, ''I'm a tough campaigner.'' Excusing himself for speaking anonymously, he said, ''It's important not to look too anxious.''</p>
        <p>The Gore and Bush camps have only begun their painstaking hunts to find just the right running mate, and to resolve perhaps the one lingering mystery in the presidential sweepstakes before the national conventions in late summer.</p>
        <p>In recent days, Tony Coelho, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, has been making the rounds, informing some politicians -- even some that others on the campaign said they did not consider hot prospects -- that they were in contention.</p>
        <p>''I talked to Coelho,'' said one politician. ''He told me I would be considered. I said, 'Thanks.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Coelho declined to discuss such conversations, and, in an interview, would not even confirm that they were taking place. But he chuckled at the attention he was getting from politicians who were quietly trying to win him over.</p>
        <p>Asked if people were undermining their chances by being too overt, he said: ''I don't think it hurts one way or another. It identifies personalities,  and that's fine.''</p>
        <p>Warren Christopher, the former secretary of state, is running the vice presidential screening process for Mr. Gore. The vice president turned to him because Mr. Christopher had the same job in 1992, when he helped Bill Clinton settle on Senator Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has picked Dick Cheney, a former defense secretary and White House chief of staff who served under his father, to conduct his search.</p>
        <p>Officials in both campaigns said they will be looking for contenders who could plausibly -- and admirably -- serve as president, but who also would complement the strengths or weaknesses of the nominee and add some zip to the ticket. Despite the coming months of speculation about who is on which list, the campaign officials said the decisions will not likely be made until just before the national conventions.</p>
        <p>Since the Republican convention is first, Mr. Gore's choice may be in direct reaction to Mr. Bush's. For example, Gore advisers said that if Mr. Bush picks a woman, they might feel pressure to do the same.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Coelho said that because he and Mr. Gore know most of the contenders pretty well, one of Mr. Christopher's most important duties is to oversee background checks.</p>
        <p>''The vetting process becomes important -- that will eliminate some people,'' Mr. Coelho said. ''That's what Warren does.''</p>
        <p>Even if they do not get picked, politicians say it burnishes their image just to be mentioned.</p>
        <p>Representative Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, said a few of his friends in Congress and in labor unions asked if they could float his name. ''I didn't dissuade them,'' he said. ''It's an honor.'' Asked if an appearance on Geraldo Rivera's show was useful in getting his name mentioned, he said, ''Absolutely.'' At the very least, Mr. Menendez said, he would get the opportunity to press a favorite cause: ''Why Hispanic-Americans should be voting Democratic in this election.''</p>
        <p>Some possible contenders are being pushed into the limelight by people far removed from the selection process. Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the House Democratic whip, said he publicly suggested Mr. Menendez and Mr. Richardson because ''they are both really qualified and fine people and deserve to be very seriously considered.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bonior also acknowledged that he thought it was important, at the very least, for House members to get some attention. ''We want our leaders considered for different positions,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Several contenders said their model of what not to do was Gov. John Engler of Michigan, who was viewed by many Republicans as an unabashed self-promoter for the job four years ago, with constant visits to Washington. Even so, while Mr. Engler did not get picked, one strategist for Mr. Dole at the time said the nominee was flattered by the attention.</p>
        <p>Many Democrats say that Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts has been one of the most obvious practitioners of the subtle-but-aggressive approach. He traveled to early primary states to campaign for Mr. Gore and, the Gore campaign has noticed, has delivered speeches on national policy that helped raise his profile.</p>
        <p>On the Republican side, advisers to Elizabeth Dole made no secret of her desire to help Mr. Bush -- and get her name out. After ending her own bid for the Republican nomination, she frequently stumped for Mr. Bush in early primary states. And she has the added benefit that her husband, Bob Dole, trumpets her availability while she plays coy.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ridge is cited by many Republicans for most adroitly positioning himself. ''He has the keenest political eye to what you may have to do to be considered,'' said Chris Hennick, a former executive director of the Republican Governors Association.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ridge is an obvious contender because he comes from a battleground state, has a compelling biography as a Vietnam veteran and is versed in national issues from his days in Congress. Most of all, he gets along well with Mr. Bush. To many Republicans, his biggest drawback is that he favors abortion rights, but that position could help Mr. Bush appeal to independents and other swing voters.</p>
        <p>The Pennsylvania governor helped himself by successfully pushing for the Republican National Convention to be held in Philadelphia. So he has a legitimate explanation for traveling the country meeting with Republicans.</p>
        <p>In his appearance here before the Lincoln Club of Northern California, a group of moderate Republicans, Mr. Ridge, brimming with praise for Mr. Bush, spoke of the governor's ''candor, his mischievous humor, his directness, his decision-making ability.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ridge said the governor's ''compassionate conservative message makes a lot of sense.'' He defended Mr. Bush's controversial proposal to cut taxes by nearly half a trillion dollars, saying, ''I don't think Governor Bush should abandon his plan to cut taxes.''</p>
        <p>After the event, Mr. Ridge insisted in an interview that he had been careful not to campaign to be picked as Mr. Bush's running mate. ''I don't think it's his style,'' Mr. Ridge said of Mr. Bush. ''I don't think it's appropriate. It's certainly not my style.''</p>
        <p>Even so, Mr. Ridge's behavior has seemed strikingly similar to that of another Republican who was sleeping down the hall from Mr. Ridge at the lodge in Pebble Beach: Dan Quayle. But he was here to play golf, not politics.</p>
        <p>Consider this passage from Mr. Quayle's book: ''The vice presidency isn't an office you can campaign for,'' he said. ''But I had tried, as subtlety as I could, to make clear I was both qualified and available.''</p>
        <p>Did Mr. Ridge knock on the former vice president's door for advice? He laughed and said he did not even know Mr. Quayle was staying here.</p>
