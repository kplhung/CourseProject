        <p>Illustrating the growing pressure on telecommunication companies to merge in Europe, Spain's largest telephone operator, Telefonica S.A., is negotiating to acquire the Netherlands' largest telephone company, Royal KPN, for about 60 billion euros, or $54.5 billion.</p>
        <p>The combined company would have a market capitalization of 141 billion euros, or $128 billion.</p>
        <p>Talks between Telefonica and Royal KPN are just the latest round in an effort by a number of once state-owned monopolies to create pan-European networks with the scale to compete against the new breed of telephone behemoths like Vodafone AirTouch P.L.C.</p>
        <p>The discussions, according to executives close to the talks, are in their final stages, though the companies may still decide to abandon the effort.</p>
        <p>An agreement is not expected until at least the end of this week or early next week, leaving a series of hurdles -- including surprise bidders -- and enough time to derail a deal. Adding complexity to the negotiations is a third possible partner, NTT DoCoMo Inc., Japan's largest mobile phone operator, which has also been in talks with KPN. Executives close to the talks said those negotiations could lead to a separate alliance among all three companies' mobile telephone operations.</p>
        <p>While the details are not completed, the executives said, the deal would be structured as a merger with each side controlling half of the seats on the board of the combined company. Neither company is expected to be paid a premium, the executives said. Based on the stock prices of each company today, Telefonica is worth 83 billion euros while KPN is worth 58 billion euros.</p>
        <p>According to executives close to the talks, if Telefonica and KPN proceed with the merger, the combined company may also make a bid for Orange P.L.C., Britain's third-largest mobile phone operator. A combination would also help finance coming auctions for third-generation mobile telephone licenses set to take place throughout the Continent.</p>
        <p>Analysts and investors seemed enthusiastic about the possibility of a merger, bidding up the shares of both companies. Shares of KPN rose 3.5 euros, or 2.9 percent, to 125, after a 9.6 percent jump on Monday. Shares of Telefonica increased 2.26 euros, or 9.2 percent, to 26.74. Spain's stock market was closed yesterday.</p>
