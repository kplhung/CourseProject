        <p>When to Use Grape Seed Oil</p>
        <p>Q. I can't find grape seed oil. Is there a substitute?  A. The oil, a light-bodied flavorless oil pressed from the seeds of wine grapes, can generally be replaced by other neutral oils, like safflower, canola or vegetable.</p>
        <p>Since grape seed oil is extracted via the cold press method (as are top-quality olive oils) it has a clean flavor without any of the undesirable ''processed'' notes in some other oils. While these notes are undetectable in robust dishes, they might show up in subtly seasoned preparations, like mild vinaigrettes, dressings and mayonnaise, so it is better to use grape seed oil for these.</p>

        <p>Since grape seed oil is extracted via the cold press method (as are top-quality olive oils) it has a clean flavor without any of the undesirable ''processed'' notes in some other oils. While these notes are undetectable in robust dishes, they might show up in subtly seasoned preparations, like mild vinaigrettes, dressings and mayonnaise, so it is better to use grape seed oil for these.</p>
        <p>Grape seed oil is also preferable sometimes because it has a high smoking point. At the smoking point, oils break down, giving foods an ''off'' flavor, or even burning them. This makes grape seed oil especially good for deep fat frying.</p>
        <p>Grape seed oil is sold in supermarkets and specialty shops, for $8 to $12 for 26 to 32 ounces.</p>
        <p>A Primer on Creme Fraiche</p>
        <p>Q. What, exactly, is creme fraiche?  A. Creme fraiche is a cultured dairy product made from heavy cream. In France, it is made by letting unpasteurized cream slowly ferment and thicken at room temperature until it acquires a complex, buttery flavor with a sour tang. In the United States, creme fraiche is made by introducing bacteria, like that in yogurt, into pasteurized cream.</p>
        <p>Creme fraiche has several uses. When whipped until it holds peaks, it makes a lush topping for desserts. It can be added to sauces to thicken and enrich them, and unlike sour cream, will not curdle when heated.</p>
        <p>Creme fraiche can be found in most specialty food shops and many large supermarkets. But you can also make it at home. Simply mix one cup heavy cream (preferably not ultrapasteurized) with two tablespoons buttermilk, which contains the required bacteria, and let the mixture sit, loosely covered, at room  temperature until it thickens, anywhere from 12 to 36 hours. Homemade creme fraiche will keep for about 10 days in the refrigerator.</p>
