        <p>As he prepares for the Republican National Convention this summer, David L. Cohen, an urbane political insider and civic factotum worthy of the Medicis, is willing to risk the ultimate rhetorical jabbing at his beloved city.</p>
        <p>''People didn't have low expectations of Philadelphia; they had no expectations of Philadelphia,'' Mr. Cohen, co-chairman of the city's convention host committee, said in his 52nd-floor law office overlooking a city that undeniably gleamed with the stuff of renaissance.</p>
        <p>''They thought of Philadelphia: old city, falling apart, dirty, unsafe,'' said the advocate, recalling two catastrophic mayoral images that long beset this place. ''You know, Frank Rizzo lining up African-Americans on North Broad Street with a billy club in his cummerbund; Wilson Goode dropping a bomb on his own city.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen beamed down upon the turnaround in that image across the last decade, an exuberant rebirth confirmed by the Republicans' choice of this Democratic bastion above eight other contenders as precisely the attractive, entertaining city they need.</p>
        <p>Basic hospitality and civic elbow grease is at the heart of the turnaround. The city, long a modern conventioneer's backwater, has succeeded at the breakneck task of building 4,500 new downtown hotel rooms in the past four years. Philadelphia thereby more than doubled its goal and finally ascended to the heavyweight class by being able to offer the 20,000 rooms that the convention industry requires for a city to be rated a prime destination.</p>
        <p>''This is a huge opportunity for the city,'' said former Mayor Edward G. Rendell, still a popular politician here for conceiving the fast-forward construction plan four years ago when virtually no one believed Philadelphia could pull it off. Invincibly excited at the possibilities of his city, Mr. Rendell has since become the new Democratic national chairman in charge of defeating the Republicans' ticket. Far from feeling conflicted, he promises to be dancing discreetly in the streets when the Republicans pack into town on July 29.</p>
        <p>''I wish the Republicans a tremendous first-class experience, but I'll be around to respond to the content of the convention as the loyal opposition, pointing out the hyperbole,'' he happily promised. ''I might even wear an elephant necktie one day out of respect.''</p>
        <p>Philadelphians know Mr. Rendell would have donned a clown suit if that is what it took to win a presidential convention, the city's first in 52 years. In 1948, Philadelphia had all three, including the Progressives. But hotel space gradually became the main shortcoming in a city well noted for its stock of fine restaurants and peerless settings of American history.</p>
        <p>''Now Philadelphia is right on the cusp of being one of the premier destination cities in America and this convention will put us over,'' predicted Mr. Cohen, celebrating the Republican flood of 45,000 political and media visitors to a city that did not have a modern convention center until seven years ago.</p>
        <p>It now has two, and James DiPaula, the Republicans' convention manager who is known as Chip, is delighted to be using both plus the city's trove of historic and cultural treasures -- from the Liberty Bell to the Museum of Art's ''Rocky'' steps.</p>
        <p>''We've had fine local support in past conventions, but nothing like what this city is showing us,'' said Mr. DiPaula, citing the host committee's creation of a shuttle bus system that will operate 15 hours a day on 21 routes among 95 hotels as free transportation. In contrast, Republicans at the 1996 convention in San Diego had to pay $60 each for a shuttle system that operated only 8 hours a day.</p>
        <p>More than 10,000 residents anxious to show off their city have volunteered as unpaid guides, drivers and greeters for a convention that so far is an affair of symbiosis, not partisanship. Mayor John F. Street, the city's ranking Democrat, garnered more than 7,500 new local jobs alone from the new hotel space. He, in turn, is working on new municipal contracts to make sure city workers stay aboard the hospitality wagon.</p>
        <p>As Republican major domo, Mr. DiPaula savors the 6,600 miles of fiber optic cable and the studio-quality television lighting that blankets the city's First Union Center. This is the three-year-old sports arena and convention hall in south Philadelphia, three miles from downtown, where delegates will hold their sessions and flash their campaign message to the world.</p>
        <p>With the Internet looming large this year for both major party conventions, Mr. DiPaula is preparing enough electronics to serve not just the estimated 25-million-member broadcast audience, but a more participatory audience of another 25 million on the Web. The convention will have extensive rows of ''Internet Alley'' space for Web reporters and ''streaming video'' computer broadcasters.</p>
        <p>''A former speaker once said all politics is local,'' Mr. DiPaula noted, quoting the late Tip O'Neill. ''No more: All politics is personal.''</p>
        <p>Actually, politics is both and no one knows that better than former Mayor Rendell, who worked closely with Republican Gov. Tom Ridge to win the convention. It was the governor who urged Republicans to ''go into some nontraditional constituencies'' and broaden their convention image.</p>
        <p>Peripheral delegate meetings will be held at the downtown convention center on Market Street, which embraces the spectacularly refurbished Reading railroad terminal shed. The center was built in conjunction with the Marriott convention hotel, the badly needed keystone to the city's recovery that came close to failing when, Mr. Cohen recounts, banks lost faith in the city.</p>
        <p>The Marriott chain finally had to finance the hotel with its own cash, all the while predicting it would be the city's last new hotel, Mr. Cohen loves to note. ''Well, Marriott has since built three more,'' he adds with an airy smile that exemplifies the city's mood right now in awaiting the Republicans.</p>
        <p>''This is a great moment for Ed, but perhaps an awkward one, too,'' said Mr. Cohen, who for eight years was Mayor Rendell's most trusted adviser, providing Panza practicality for the Quixote impulses of Mr. Rendell. But the expansive Mr. Rendell, who many expect to run next for governor, says no problem, he will somehow manage to survive a week that includes Philadelphia's biggest opportunity for free media since the signing of the Declaration of Independence. About 15,000 news workers are expected.</p>
        <p>''You could not buy this,'' said Mr. Cohen, anticipating the hundreds of foreign and heartland television crews who, even more than the network anchors, will broadcast the images of a renewed city. ''It's a once-in-a-generation opportunity.''</p>
        <p>After that, it will be back to donkey neckties and uninhibited partisan hyperbole for Mr. Rendell in Los Angeles, where the Democrats convene on Aug. 14. For his city, if not his party, the former mayor is hoping that the Republicans disprove the notion that Democrats just naturally throw better parties. ''But the Republicans spend more money,'' he always emphasizes, ever the Philadelphian.</p>
