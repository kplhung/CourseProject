        <p>The National Association of Orchestra Leaders has filed papers supporting the management of the Apollo Theater in a labor dispute with musicians who work on the program ''Amateur Night at the Apollo,'' officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Grace Blake, the executive director of the Apollo Foundation, Charles Peterson, the treasurer of the orchestra leaders association, called the attempts by band members to organize a union ''illegal and unlawful practices.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Peterson offered his association's support in the foundation's fight with Local 802 of the Associated Musicians of Greater New York, a division of the American Federation of Musicians. The dispute began in March, when four members of the band Ray Chew and the Crew tried to organize a chapter of Local 802 at ''Amateur Night.''</p>
        <p>The four have already been recognized as union members for their work on the weekly televised program ''It's Showtime at the Apollo,'' which is produced by a private company, Inner City Theater Group. Inner City rents the theater from the foundation and pays the musicians separately. The foundation has argued that the musicians are independent contractors, not employees, and has asked the National Labor Relations Board to mediate.</p>
        <p>Neither Ms. Blake or Christopher Seymour, an organizer for Local 802, could be reached for comment yesterday.</p>
