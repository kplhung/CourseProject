      <abstract>
        <p>Prof Thomas W Smith letter on May 2 article urges consumers to drop cable television to combat monopoly over information</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You refer to a blackout of ABC by Time Warner (front page, May 2). But there was no blackout. Time Warner was simply refusing to deliver ABC through its medium. The solution for consumers is obvious: unplug your cable and buy a set of rabbit ears.</p>
        <p>The trend toward centralization in news and entertainment companies gives the lie to the notion that the communications revolution always entails decentralization of information. It is increasingly clear that government will not protect us from these behemoths by taking the common-sense approach of splitting them up.</p>

It is increasingly clear that government will not protect us from these behemoths by taking the common-sense approach of splitting them up.</p>
        <p>Perhaps we should expect this. As de Tocqueville noted, Americans are tempted to surrender their freedoms to centralizing forces for the sake of convenience. Asserting freedom in this case means opting out: let's not help these companies monopolize information by giving them our money.</p>
