        <p>While the average number of women's collegiate teams per school is at a high, the percentage of women coaching them is the lowest ever, a study of intercollegiate athletics released on Monday said.</p>
        <p>In the one-year period of 1999-2000, 205 new women's teams were added, creating an average of 8.14 per school. In 1972, the number was approximately two per school.</p>

        <p>While the average number of women's collegiate teams per school is at a high, the percentage of women coaching them is the lowest ever, a study of intercollegiate athletics released on Monday said.</p>
        <p>In the one-year period of 1999-2000, 205 new women's teams were added, creating an average of 8.14 per school. In 1972, the number was approximately two per school.</p>
        <p>The increase can be attributed to Title IX of the 1972 Educational Amendments, which prohibits sex discrimination at institutions that receive federal funds. So, too, is the decrease in female coaches, say R. Vivian Acosta and Linda Jean Carpenter, the authors of the study.</p>
        <p>When Title IX was enacted, more than 90 percent of women's teams were coached by women. Currently, 45.6 percent of the coaches of women's teams are women, down from 47.4 in 1998. By 2000, there were 7,771 head coaching jobs for women's teams, an increase of 534 from 1998. Yet, of the 534 new jobs in the last two years, women have been hired in only 107.</p>
        <p>''The good news is reflective of a generation expanding its wings in athletics because its members grew up as beneficiaries of Title IX,'' Carpenter said. ''On the other side of the coin, women have a bigger menu of job choices than they had before Title IX and so now, both on the college and professional levels, are taking advantage of the opportunities there.''</p>
        <p>Acosta and Carpenter, both retired professors of physical education at Brooklyn College, began studying the impact of Title IX on women's collegiate athletics 23 years ago. An update of the study, issued every two years, is based on questionnaires sent to 1,000 schools in 1997-98. It has a 75 percent response rate.</p>
        <p>The study also found that the same five sports -- basketball, volleyball, tennis, cross-country and softball -- continue to be most popular among female athletes. But soccer has shown the greatest growth of any sport in the last 23 years and is now offered on 84 percent of college campuses. Lacrosse and golf have grown exponentially in the past decade; gymnastics has declined among women's programs and is being dropped by some men's programs.</p>
        <p>The study also found a percentage decline in female athletic directors and administrators. In 1972, more than 90 percent of women's programs were directed by a female head administrator. Today, 17.8 percent of women's programs are directed by a female, a decrease of 19.4 percent from 1998, and 23 percent of women's athletic programs have no women anywhere in the athletic structure.</p>
        <p>Of the study's many findings, Carpenter said she was most struck by how the face of women's athletics had changed over the decades.</p>
        <p>''In the old days, there used to be more junior varsity teams and much broader variety of sports offered; that's been narrowing,'' Carpenter said, speaking by telephone from her home in West Brookfield, Mass. She also noted that the sports with sustained growth were the ''sweaty, grunty and aggressive sports.''</p>
        <p>''That tells me that there is a sense of self-confidence among women today,'' she said. ''They can participate in sports that bring them joy and society doesn't insist that they can't show aggressiveness or assertiveness.''</p>
