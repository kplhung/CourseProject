        <p>''Dream of Light'' was shown as part of the 1992 New York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 1, 1992. The film opens today at the Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, South Village.</p>
        <p>As one of the people seen in Victor Erice's ''Dream of Light'' (none of them are actors) finally wonders, ''How can such a small tree bear so much fruit?'' The same question might be asked about this quiet, meticulous and supremely simple film, which concentrates exclusively on the process whereby a painter, Antonio Lopez Garcia, works on a still life of the above-mentioned tree. Mr. Erice's method is modest, yet his film manages to achieve a mesmerizing intensity. The purity and breadth of this meticulous study are all the more gratifying in view of its unprepossessing style.</p>
        <p>For nearly two and a half hours Mr. Lopez Garcia is seen working patiently on his project, observing and painting a small tree that stands in his Madrid backyard. Mr. Lopez Garcia is most emphatically not in a hurry. Neither is Mr. Erice, whose tranquil pace appears to be set by his subject. So the film watches serenely as Mr. Lopez Garcia arrives home with his canvas, stretches it out and nails it to a frame. He is then seen looking long and hard at the tree itself, which he later dots with a series of unexplained white markings. A string with a weight attached is tied to the foliage, and a horizontal line is drawn along the backyard wall.</p>
        <p>The camera watches as this exceptionally precise artist drives stakes into the ground at two exact spots in which he plans to keep his feet during the painting process. It sees him locate the perfect center of the blank canvas on which he plans to work. Most of these details are observed in silence, which lends a surprising degree of suspense to the undertaking.</p>
        <p>Every day, as the film takes the form of a journal, Mr. Lopez Garcia is seen venturing into his backyard to carry his creative efforts one step further. And the process behind the painting, a process that is entirely mysterious as the film begins, is made progressively clearer as the work moves along. Meanwhile Mr. Erice begins incorporating gentle, amiable glimpses of Mr. Lopez Garcia's friends and fellow artists, who do not act but simply drop by to witness the proceedings. Through these visits, and through small talk on subjects ranging from Mr. Lopez Garcia's art school days to his thoughts about Michelangelo, Mr. Erice (director of ''The Spirit of the Beehive'') can be seen creating his own affectionate portrait to parallel the one taking shape on screen.</p>
        <p>''Dream of Light'' (the Spanish title, ''El Sol del Membrillo,'' translates more directly as ''The Quince-Tree Sun'') should be watched appreciatively and peacefully, in keeping with the tranquillity of the material. In its own minimalist way it becomes a thoughtful, delicate inquiry into the essence of the artistic process and a tribute to the beauty and mutability of nature.</p>
