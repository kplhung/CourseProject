        <p>The captain of a 6,000-ton Norwegian tanker was arrested yesterday on charges of failing to report a hazardous leak to the United States Coast Guard in Baltimore after a crew member passed a note to the authorities, warning that the ship had a hole in its side and was in danger of sinking.</p>
        <p>The captain, Davor Maric, a Croatian, was released on $30,000 bond and placed under travel restrictions after a hearing before a magistrate in United States District Court in Baltimore. Another hearing is scheduled for today.</p>
        <p>An affidavit filed in court by a Coast Guard investigator said the ship, the Freja Jutlandic, was taking on water through a 12-by-18-inch breach in the hull in the engine room. Records seized from the ship indicated that representatives of its owner had instructed the captain to install a temporary patch and continue to Tampa, Fla., to unload the cargo of urea ammonium nitrate.</p>
        <p>Crew members feared that the patch would not hold and that the ship might sink on its five-day trip to Florida, according to the affidavit by Patrick S. Donnelly, a Coast Guard special agent. Mr. Donnelly said that during a routine inspection, a crew member passed a note to a Coast Guard official that said, ''There is a crack on the port side of engine.''</p>
        <p>Inspectors found that the ship had been leaking more than 500 gallons of oily water an hour and that the condition was hazardous despite the temporary patch, according to the affidavit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maric faces charges of violating federal laws that require reporting hazardous conditions to the Coast Guard and with creating false entries in the ship's record to conceal the dumping of untreated oily waste.  Both violations carry possible five-year prison sentences.</p>
