        <p>Albert J. Pirro Jr., the real estate development lawyer who is scheduled to stand trial next week on federal tax-fraud charges, announced today that he wanted to add another lawyer to his high-powered defense team: Albert J. Pirro Jr.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pirro, 52, is not dumping his lawyers, said Colleen Roche, his spokeswoman. But neither is he telling why he decided to file a Notice of Appearance in Federal District Court here to allow him to defend himself, at least part time.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Albert J. Pirro Jr., the real estate development lawyer who is scheduled to stand trial next week on federal tax-fraud charges, announced today that he wanted to add another lawyer to his high-powered defense team: Albert J. Pirro Jr.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pirro, 52, is not dumping his lawyers, said Colleen Roche, his spokeswoman. But neither is he telling why he decided to file a Notice of Appearance in Federal District Court here to allow him to defend himself, at least part time.</p>
        <p>''He has considerable litigation experience, and he intends to actively participate with his legal team in his own defense,'' Ms. Roche said.</p>
        <p>Federal prosecutors had no comment on the unusual move. Whether Mr. Pirro will be able to play both defendant and defense lawyer is up to Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr., who will preside over the trial.</p>
        <p>Even so, today's announcement added a new element to a case already soaked in political intrigue and family drama. Mr. Pirro and his brother, Anthony, 45, are accused of illegally deducting more than $1 million in personal spending as business expenses on tax returns.</p>
        <p>If Albert Pirro is allowed to defend himself, does this mean that he would cross-examine his brother,  whom he has accused of being incompetent and addled by cocaine? Or does this mean that he would get to make an opening statement or closing argument to the jury without taking the stand?</p>
        <p>''Oh! Oh!'' was how Bennett L. Gershman, a professor at Pace Law School, reacted to the news. ''That is weird. That is very, very unusual.''</p>
        <p>One of the most tantalizing questions in the case is whether Albert Pirro's wife -- Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester district attorney -- will be asked to testify. Mr. Pirro's request to join the case raises the possibility that she could be questioned by her husband over their expenses.</p>
        <p>Gerald L. Shargel, a prominent defense lawyer in Manhattan, said: ''Law strongly supports the idea that either you are your own counsel, or represented by counsel, but not both. You can't have it both ways.''</p>
        <p>But perhaps you can, said William I. Aronwald, a former federal prosecutor who works as a criminal defense lawyer in White Plains.</p>
        <p>''Frankly, I can't see how the judge can deny him joining the defense team,'' he said. But the risks, he cautioned, were high: ''It could be a lifeline, or it could an anchor that can take him to the bottom of the ocean.''</p>
