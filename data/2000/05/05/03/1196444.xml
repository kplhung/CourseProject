        <p>Fresh Challenge</p>
        <p>At 75, after 50 years as a international star of opera, the Italian lyric tenor Carlo Bergonzi is trying something new. At Carnegie Hall at 8 tonight, he will take on the title role in Verdi's ''Otello'' for the first time.

''The soft and loud tones have never been performed as Verdi wrote them,'' Mr. Bergonzi said recently. ''I will try to offer a different interpretation of this role.''</p>

        <p>Fresh Challenge</p>
        <p>At 75, after 50 years as a international star of opera, the Italian lyric tenor Carlo Bergonzi is trying something new. At Carnegie Hall at 8 tonight, he will take on the title role in Verdi's ''Otello'' for the first time. The concert version of the opera, a work first performed at La Scala on Feb. 5, 1887, when Verdi was 73, will conclude the 29th season of Eve Queler's Opera Orchestra of New York. ''The soft and loud tones have never been performed as Verdi wrote them,'' Mr. Bergonzi said recently. ''I will try to offer a different interpretation of this role.''</p>
        <p>For Laughs</p>
        <p>Carl Reiner will be the recipient of the third annual Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. In the culmination of a celebration that includes lectures, symposiums and master classes, Mr. Reiner will receive the award in ceremonies on Oct. 24 at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. ''His art and wit have helped shape the humorous landscape of the United States,'' Lawrence J. Wilker, president of the center, said in a statement yesterday. Bronx-born Mr. Reiner, now 78, achieved renown on Sid Caesar's ''Your Show of Shows,'' created the ''Dick Van Dyke Show,'' collaborated with Mel Brooks on the ''2,000-year-old man'' comedy records, wrote the semiautobiographical novel ''Enter Laughing,'' which became a play and a film, and wrote, directed, acted in or produced films from ''Where's Poppa?'' to ''Oh God'' and ''Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid.'' Proceeds of the awards ceremony go to nurture young American humorists.</p>
        <p>One by One</p>
        <p>They're off and running for six weeks beginning tonight. Who? Playrights like Romulus Linney, Warren Leight, Leslie Ayvazian, Billy Aronson, Steve Feffer, David Ives and Heather Dundas. What's the event? A marathon, of course. It's Marathon 2000, the 23rd annual festival of new one-act plays, which continues through June 11 at Curt Dempster's Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, in Clinton. The opening series, through May 14, comprises Mr. Linney's ''Madmen,'' Ms. Ayvazian's ''24 Years,'' Mr. Aronson's ''Light Years'' and Mr. Feffer's ''Little Airplanes of the Heart.''</p>
        <p>First</p>
        <p>Both the Port Authority and devotees of American song stand to profit beginning tonight when the soprano Renee Fleming offers the first of two performances on opposite sides of the Hudson. At 7:30 p.m. in Prudential Hall at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, Ms. Fleming, accompanied by Andre Previn, will offer three world premiere song cycles and two arias from Mr. Previn's opera ''A Streetcar Named Desire.'' Appearing with Mr. Previn at 2 p.m. Sunday at Alice Tully Hall in the Lincoln Center Art of the Song series, Ms. Fleming will present the New York City premieres of the songs by Ricky Ian Gordon, Aaron Jay Kernis and Mr. Previn that will be sung tonight.</p>
