        <p>President Clinton and his top aides, acknowledging that they still lack the votes to pass a decisive  China trade measure later this month, increased pressure on Congress yesterday by arguing that the decision is as much about global leadership and the fate of Chinese reformers as it is about the interests of American business.</p>

        <p>President Clinton and his top aides, acknowledging that they still lack the votes to pass a decisive  China trade measure later this month, increased pressure on Congress yesterday by arguing that the decision is as much about global leadership and the fate of Chinese reformers as it is about the interests of American business.</p>
        <p>The emphasis on national security issues reflected a growing feeling within the administration that the economic arguments in favor of elevating trade ties with China, while strong, have proven insufficient for wavering lawmakers. Labor unions have subjected those lawmakers to an intensive campaign, as have other groups opposed to granting China permanent normal trade relations.</p>
        <p>''From a national security point of view, it would in my view be a very, very unwise and precarious move to say that the United States doesn't care whether they're part of the world community or not,'' President Clinton told a group of independent insurance agents meeting in Washington.</p>
        <p>Just three weeks before Congress is scheduled to vote, the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, visited New York and gave a detailed examination of the security issues at stake in the trade bill, calling it the most important chance the United States has had in a generation to help shape China's future. Mr. Berger said a rejection would threaten to set off a ''downward spiral'' in bilateral ties that he likened, without using the exact words, to a second cold war.</p>
        <p>''Rejecting permanent normal trade relations would be the worst possible blow to the best possible hope we have had in 30 years to encourage positive change in China,'' Mr. Berger said during a lengthy address at Columbia University. If the two sides start thinking of each other as adversaries, he said, ''we will find ourselves confronting each other across Asia and across the world.''</p>
        <p>The warning comes as the Clinton administration begins a final push to persuade undecided members of Congress to vote in favor of granting China the new trade status, which would allow United States companies to benefit fully from a market-opening trade agreement that paves the way for China to join the World Trade Organization. Congress is being asked to sacrifice its annual review of China's trading rights and to treat Beijing as it does most other members of the world body, based in Geneva.</p>
        <p>Administration officials and Congressional supporters estimate that they are still about 10 votes shy of the 218 votes needed for majority approval in the House. Mr. Clinton and five members of his cabinet have focused their lobbying efforts on about 30 lawmakers, most of them Democrats, who they say will make the difference between a narrow victory or defeat. Approval by the Senate appears more certain.</p>
        <p>On Capitol Hill yesterday, opposing sides both claimed that the momentum was shifting their way after the two-week House recess. But there were signs that both sides were nervous about the final vote.</p>
        <p>Representative Bill Archer, a Texas Republican who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over the China trade bill, warned business leaders yesterday that the outcome remains in jeopardy.</p>
        <p>''I'm more concerned about getting a majority of votes today than I was four weeks ago,'' Mr. Archer said. ''Failure to pass this would create an unworkable trade environment that will slop over to the rest of the world.''</p>
        <p>Administration officials said yesterday that President Clinton has allotted a large block of his own schedule in coming weeks for lobbying members of Congress.</p>
        <p>The president is planning a visit to a farm community to advertise how the trade agreement might benefit farmers, who potentially could export more grain and meat. White House officials are also considering inviting former presidents and cabinet secretaries to the White House to highlight the fact that a bipartisan coalition of former national leaders favors the measure.</p>
        <p>Last night, Mr. Clinton invited a dozen members of Congress to join him at the White House residence for a discussion on China. Mr. Clinton arranged for Martin Lee, a prominent Hong Kong opposition leader who favors granting China the new trade privileges, to attend and speak to the lawmakers.</p>
        <p>But the president has so far declined to accede to Republican demands that he arrange a prime time, nationwide television address on China, a step Republican supporters of the trade measure argue is necessary to line up enough Democratic support. Administration officials said privately that the president does not wish to commit to such a speech unless the national networks agree to put it on the air, a tough sell during ''sweeps'' month, when the networks compete fiercely to attract viewers.</p>
        <p>Opposition to granting China elevated trading rights is dogged. Labor unions as well as religious, consumer and environmental groups have put heavy election-year pressure on Democrats to vote no.</p>
        <p>Unions have argued that the trade agreement will encourage United States companies to shift production to China, where, union officials say, low wages and lax labor standards make for unfair competition. About two-thirds of House Democrats are expected to vote no.</p>
        <p>Most Republicans, reflecting overwhelming business support, say they will vote yes. But a minority of hard-liners in the party accuse the Clinton administration of appeasing Beijing, awarding it long-sought trading rights even as they say the nation steps up repression at home and threatens to become more belligerent abroad.</p>
        <p>China is likely to join the World Trade Organization, a regulatory body, even if Congress decides not to grant permanent normal trade relations. But United States companies would not get many of the benefits unless Congress agrees to give up its annual vote.</p>
        <p>Administration officials argue that the trade agreement with China is a bonanza: The Chinese made all the trade concessions, while Congress just has to agree to treat it like other trading partners. But as the lobbying campaign enters the final stretch and union opposition has proven effective, the administration is increasingly relying on national security arguments to sway uncommitted lawmakers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berger said yesterday that the agreement is so beneficial to United States companies that want to do business in China -- and requires so many concessions by China's Communist Party-controlled bureaucracy -- that Beijing would view rejection of permanent normal trade relations as a seismic shift in United States strategy. ''The Chinese government and people simply will not believe we rejected it for economic reasons,'' he said. ''They will suspect that rejection is a strategic decision to pursue a course of confrontation, contention and containment.''</p>
        <p>Failure to pass the accord would rebound to the advantage of numerous hard-liners in Beijing who have opposed World Trade Organization concessions all along, Mr. Berger said. In such a scenario, he said, he considers it likely that China, already mired in a high-level debate about ties with the United States, would turn inward, become more repressive and adopt a more militant stance toward Taiwan.</p>
        <p>He also said rejection would be a slap in the face to America's Asian allies, especially Japan and South Korea, both of which have urged Congress to elevate trade ties with China. He said Asian allies would view a no vote as a sign that America has become an ''unreliable, unilateral'' nation that has lost its capacity to lead.</p>
        <p>In a boost for supporters of the bill, Representative Steny H. Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat who has opposed granting China trade privileges in the annual votes, said yesterday that he would support permanent normal trading status. Another Democrat who had been uncommitted, Lois Capps of California, also declared her support.</p>
        <p>But over the recess, two supporters of the annual vote said they would vote against the bill. They are Representative Steve Buyer, Republican of Indiana, and Representative Bill Luther, Democrat of Minnesota.</p>
        <p>In a sign that the administration and its Congressional supporters need more inducements to recruit fence-sitters, Mr. Archer, the House Republican, reversed his earlier position and said he would consider parallel legislation to the trade bill.</p>
        <p>Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat in the House, has proposed creating an executive body that would have powers to monitor and report on China compliance with international labor and human rights standards, as well as its adherence to trade agreements.</p>
