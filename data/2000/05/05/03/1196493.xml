        <p>The New York State Legislature has passed an important bill that would make the state the first to require the tobacco industry to make cigarettes sold within its borders more resistant to starting fires. Gov. George Pataki should sign the bill when it arrives on his desk.</p>
        <p>The legislation, which was approved unanimously in both the Assembly and Senate, would require that by 2002 cigarettes meet a fire safety standard set by the state's Office of Fire Prevention and Control. Under the measure, cigarettes would have to be self-extinguishing within a certain time after a smoker stops puffing on the cigarette. The technology for such products is readily available. Tobacco companies have the ability to make less flammable cigarettes by altering the cigarette paper to slow down the rate at which it burns. Some cigarette brands already on the market would probably meet fire safety criteria without any change.</p>

        <p>The New York State Legislature has passed an important bill that would make the state the first to require the tobacco industry to make cigarettes sold within its borders more resistant to starting fires. Gov. George Pataki should sign the bill when it arrives on his desk.</p>
        <p>The legislation, which was approved unanimously in both the Assembly and Senate, would require that by 2002 cigarettes meet a fire safety standard set by the state's Office of Fire Prevention and Control. Under the measure, cigarettes would have to be self-extinguishing within a certain time after a smoker stops puffing on the cigarette. The technology for such products is readily available. Tobacco companies have the ability to make less flammable cigarettes by altering the cigarette paper to slow down the rate at which it burns. Some cigarette brands already on the market would probably meet fire safety criteria without any change.</p>
        <p>This proposal has strong support from anti-smoking advocates, firefighters and consumer groups. Lighted cigarettes dropped on a bed or couch are the leading cause of fire-related deaths in New York, causing nearly 50 deaths a year. But the tobacco industry has fought sensible regulations on the grounds that there should be a single national safety standard.</p>
        <p>The New York bill provides that it will not take effect if a federal standard is created by April 2001. But the reality is that Congress has done nothing on this issue and probably will not until states take the lead. If the bill becomes law with Governor Pataki's approval, other states will probably follow New York's example. That will give Congress impetus to establish a national standard for less flammable cigarettes that could save hundreds of lives a year.</p>
