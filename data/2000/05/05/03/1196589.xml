        <p>The Clinton administration dropped its intention to invoke executive privilege today in a dispute over a Congressional request for some documents related to missing White House e-mail messages.</p>
        <p>Instead, the White House today turned over seven documents sought by the House Government Reform Committee, led by Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana.

        <p>The Clinton administration dropped its intention to invoke executive privilege today in a dispute over a Congressional request for some documents related to missing White House e-mail messages.</p>
        <p>Instead, the White House today turned over seven documents sought by the House Government Reform Committee, led by Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana. Mr. Burton's committee is investigating whether the White House deliberately concealed the missing e-mail messages on investigations ranging from campaign finance to President Clinton's affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.</p>
        <p>Jim Kennedy, the White House spokesman, said today that the documents that had been turned over were handwritten notes of White House lawyers on discussions they had had with computer experts about the e-mail messages that were not produced when they were subpoenaed in 1998.</p>
        <p>Although the White House had provided the committee on Monday with a one-page list of documents it was declining to turn over, Mr. Kennedy said the White House voluntarily waived any potential privilege claim today ''after hearing back from the committee that they were not interested in a compromise.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Burton's committee was preparing to hold additional hearings on Wednesday and Thursday. On Thursday, the former White House counsel Charles F. C. Ruff was scheduled to testify.</p>
        <p>Investigators from Mr. Burton's committee and the Justice Department are trying to determine whether White House officials suppressed large numbers of e-mail messages and covered up the existence of a glitch in the White House computer system that made it impossible to retrieve some e-mail correspondence. Investigators are also looking into accusations that White House officials threatened employees of a nongovernment contractor if they disclosed the computer problem, according to court papers.</p>
        <p>White House officials have blamed a ''disconnect'' between their computer technicians, who diagnosed the e-mail problem in June 1998, and their lawyers, who apparently did not understand that the glitch might affect pending subpoena requests from Congress, the independent counsel's office and Judicial Watch, a conservative legal watchdog group here that has pursued lawsuits against the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>In a related matter, a White House memorandum showed that White House technicians were asked to delete old e-mail messages that had been sent to Sidney Blumenthal, a White House aide, before early 1999.</p>
        <p>The request to delete the e-mail messages ''is still being mulled by senior management and OA [Office of Administration] Counsel,'' wrote Daniel A. Barry, a computer specialist at the executive office of the president, in a Jan. 6, 1999, memorandum to his superiors. .</p>
        <p>At the time of the request to delete the e-mail messages sent to Mr. Blumenthal, Congress was preparing for Mr. Clinton's impeachment trial, which began on Jan. 14, 1999, and concluded on Feb. 12, 1999, when the Senate voted to acquit Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal, who was in Berlin today, declined to comment.</p>
