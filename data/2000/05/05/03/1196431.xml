        <p>Residents of the financial district have had few options when it comes to stocking the pantry, so Vine Market, 25 Broad Street (Exchange Place), should be a welcome addition. It's in the Exchange Building, a century-old landmark converted into more than 300 apartments, and it is connected to Vine, a small new restaurant.</p>
        <p>The airy market is run by Nancy Hart, who was the catering manager at the Vinegar Factory and Eli's Manhattan uptown. She offers a selection of attractive items, including smoked fish, fine cheeses, bread from Tom Cat Bakery and Amy's Bread, pastries by Sarabeth's and City Bakery and a good selection of produce and high-quality olive oils, vinegars and other condiments.  The market also stocks some ingredients for baking, as well as paper goods and detergents.</p>

        <p>Half the space is devoted to prepared foods, including sandwiches, soups, rotisserie chicken, pizza, sushi, salads and pastries, some ready to go, some made to order. The market is open weekdays from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Saturdays, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.; and Sundays 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Delivery will soon be available south of Chambers Street.</p>
