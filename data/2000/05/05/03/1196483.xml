        <p>Since staging this West African country's first military coup last Dec. 24, the army has not shied away from trying on new roles besides politics.</p>
        <p>There was the time a couple of months ago when it tried its hand energetically, if somewhat too energetically, at coaching soccer. Ivory Coast's national team, the Elephants -- made up mostly of Ivoirians who play for high-paying European teams and reluctantly took time off to participate in the African Nations Cup in Ghana -- performed so spiritlessly that they failed to qualify for the quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>Clearly angered, the country's military rulers forced the players to make an unexpected detour on their way back to Europe -- to a military camp here. Stripped of their passports and their freedom, not to mention their cell phones, the soccer stars spent two days at the base taking lessons in civics and patriotism, and doing push-ups.</p>
        <p>Recently, soldiers driving sport utility vehicles bearing no license plates began patrolling a 25-mile stretch of highway between Abidjan and Grand-Bassam, a popular beach resort. Ticketed drivers drivers have been summoned to a nearby military base, where they have been lectured and forced to jog and pay a $7 fine.</p>
        <p>Traffic cop, soccer coach, gym teacher -- the army is control in  Ivory Coast, a country that for decades had been one of the few African nations not to have experienced military rule and that is still the richest in French-speaking West Africa. Four months after the coup, it remains unclear when the army will relinquish power -- though most assume that it will happen eventually.</p>
        <p>Much of the uncertainty stems from Gen. Robert Guei, the leader of the junta, who only a few months ago declared in an address to the nation that, ''Contrary to what we have seen in many countries in the sub-region, power does not interest me.'' In recent months, General Guei (pronounced gay) has eschewed such clarity in favor of coy comments that suggest that he is, in fact, interested in power. ''Guei is behaving more and more like a candidate,'' said one Western diplomat.</p>
        <p>As the Ivoirian political class and Western diplomats have come to believe that the general is preparing to present himself as a presidential candidate, the possibility is likely to complicate further the country's yearlong political crisis. The trouble led to the overthrow in December of President Henri Konan Bedie, whose party had been in power since independence from France in 1960.</p>
        <p>In Bourbana, a slum sprawling on a hill next to a lagoon across from the skyscrapers of downtown Abidjan, General Guei's rise was cheered in December. Last Friday morning, residents of Bourbana, mostly northerners or immigrants who had become targets during President Bedie's increasingly xenophobic administration, still spoke well of the general.</p>
        <p>The putrid smell from the lagoon wafted up the hill through the labyrinth of narrow alleys that crisscross Bourbana. Women cooked and sold small items; stagnant water had collected in many alleys, and pedestrians stepped around them with great difficulty. Nevertheless, life has improved in Bourbana, said some jobless young men milling around in one of the few open spaces. The police, they said, no longer harass them and do not stop them from setting up small commercial stands along the nearby highway.</p>
        <p>Even in this slum, however, some expressed worry about the repercussions of the candidacy of a man who had seized power through the gun.</p>
        <p>''If Guei becomes president, it would please us,'' said Seydou Ouattara, 68, the traditional chief of this community. ''I don't know how to read or write, so I am not sure, but he's a military man. And if he becomes president, the whites will not give us money.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, almost all foreign aid to the Ivory Coast has been suspended because of the coup. And as the junta delays announcing whether it will hold elections by October -- the original timetable, which seems less and less likely now to be respected -- most programs go unfinanced.</p>
        <p>The United States State Department last month came out strongly against a possible candidacy by General Guei, describing it as ''inappropriate'' and any electoral outcome as clouded from the start. Officials from France and the European Union, however, would be more likely to countenance his candidacy, diplomats here said.</p>
        <p>Another factor expected to influence how a Guei candidacy would be accepted abroad is the lack of any other candidate who is popular nationwide. The leaders of two of the three main parties are divisive figures, each for different reasons.</p>
        <p>Questions over the eligibility of  Alassane D. Ouattara, a former deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, contributed to the December coup; a constitutional referendum that will essentially decide whether he can run has already been postponed. Whatever the outcome, Mr. Ouattara's base is mainly among Muslim northerners.</p>
        <p>The deposed president, Mr. Bedie, stirred up hatred against northerners and immigrants by claiming that some were more Ivoirian than others. Since the coup, Laurent Gbagbo, another potential candidate, has taken up that strategy through a newspaper close to his party, Notre Voie.</p>
        <p>Whoever becomes the next president will have a hard time restoring the luster to a country whose commercial capital, Abidjan, was once called the Paris of Africa.</p>
        <p>With the economy worsening, banditry has risen. The military government has responded by increasing summary executions. In April, General Guei announced that 66 bandits had been executed in the first three months of the year, compared with 33 for the previous trimester.</p>
        <p>The Ivoirian League of Human Rights denounced the ''sad record'' of the extrajudicial killings.</p>
        <p>Attacks against journalists, which occurred in the previous government, have been notable in several instances. The randomness of the attacks by soldiers, apparently uncoordinated, has also led to suggestions that General Guei does not have full control over the military.</p>
        <p>Young soldiers began the insurrection in December, displeased that they had not been paid money owed to them. A mutiny erupted at a military camp in western Ivory Coast over the same issue in March, and one soldier was killed.</p>
        <p>''We will do what we can for the young soldiers, but they cannot resort to blackmail,'' General Guei said in an interview with Radio France Internationale at the time. Recently, the general has been pointedly avoiding reporters.</p>
        <p>Le Jeune Democrate, an independent daily, and Le National, a newspaper that was close to the toppled government, have both been targets in recent months, leading the Committee to Protect Journalists to protest to General Guei.</p>
        <p>''We've never had freedom of speech in the Ivory Coast, but it's the dimension of the current repression that is cause for worry,'' said Jules Toualy, an editor at Le Jeune Democrate who was held for five hours by two soldiers after he wrote about the March mutiny. Mr. Toualy, who revealed the identity of his source after he was tortured, has now become a sportswriter.</p>
        <p>Soldiers raided Le National twice after the paper published articles critical of the general. One time they fired shots into the ceiling and forced journalists to do push-ups.</p>
        <p>''The truth is that soldiers do whatever they wish,'' said Theodore Brouhaud, an editor at Le National. ''They go wherever they want.''</p>
        <p>The soldiers who visited Mr. Brouhaud's newsroom forced each journalist to do 100 push-ups. ''It was a game for them, '' he said.</p>
