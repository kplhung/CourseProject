        <p>At the moment the Yankees clinched their latest improbable victory very early this morning, 2-1 over the Cleveland Indians, second baseman Chuck Knoblauch whirled and punched a fist in the air, smiling, laughing at the absurdity he had just witnessed.</p>
        <p>But Knoblauch was far more sedate this evening, his left hand wrapped in a towel. Knoblauch's sore left wrist had prompted Manager Joe Torre to scratch him from tonight's lineup, and the infielder could be placed on the 15-day disabled list after undergoing another battery of tests and examinations Thursday. If he does, it would be the first time in his 10-year career that Knoblauch's name appeared on the disabled list.</p>
        <p>''That's something they're going to have to decide,'' said Knoblauch. ''It's something I don't have any experience with.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch has been nursing the injury for nine days, after twisting his wrist while swinging a weighted bat, and the quality of his at-bats against the Indians in the opener was so poor that Torre met with Knoblauch this afternoon and told him it would be better for him, and the team at large, to do whatever it takes to make his wrist better.</p>
        <p>Torre inserted Ricky Ledee as Knoblauch's replacement as leadoff batter and started Wilson Delgado at second base.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch said he had talked to Torre ''about the difference between playing hurt and playing stupid.'' In other words, Torre did not want Knoblauch to remain in the lineup if he was going to take poor swings as he tried to cope with his injury. He went hitless in four at-bats against Cleveland, his batting average falling to .226, his on-base average to .270. Coming into this year, Knoblauch had a career average of .298 and a career on-base percentage of .388.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch will remain with the team Wednesday, when the Yankees are scheduled to play the final game of this series against the Indians, and return home with the team Thursday, when he will undergo a second round of testing on his bad wrist. A sprained wrist was initially diagnosed, but he is feeling numbness in his hand and suspects it may be more than just a sprain.</p>
        <p>''Maybe they'll find something or I can get a shot,'' said Knoblauch. ''Or maybe they'll do something different.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees have been winning without the usual production from their leadoff batter. Runs have been scarce, and this morning they managed to hold onto a 2-1 edge in a game that began Monday night after a rain delay of 2 hours 44 minutes.</p>
