        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>DRUG COSTS ARE ISSUE IN MONTANA  Brian Schweitzer, a Democratic candidate for the Senate in Montana, has campaigned hard on the high price of prescription drugs and the burden it puts on the uninsured elderly. Mr. Schweitzer, who has taken retirees to Canada to highlight the lower cost of drugs there, has exchanged television fire with Citizens for Better Medicare, a lobbying coalition led by the drug industry. Now the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which believes Mr. Schweitzer has a good shot at winning one of six seats the party needs to retake control of the Senate, has produced a television spot urging voters to ''call the big drug companies and tell them to get out of the way of Brian Schweitzer's fair prices drug plan.'' Mr. Schweitzer, a farmer who has never held elective office, is trying to unseat the Republican incumbent, Conrad Burns.</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>GOV. THOMPSON NAMED PLATFORM CHAIRMAN  Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin has been named chairman of the committee that will draft the Republican platform at the party's national convention this summer, an appointment that abortion rights advocates regard as a sign that George W. Bush, the presumed presidential nominee, will not ease the party's staunch anti-abortion position. Two years ago, Governor Thompson signed legislation outlawing the procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion. Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion Rights Action League, said the selection showed that Mr. Bush, despite his advocacy of inclusiveness, ''cares about what the far right of his party wants.'' Mr. Thompson said after his appointment on Monday that he looked forward to ''serving on the committee to articulate our party's most innovative ideas, the principles that bind us together and our vision for the future.''</p>

        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>BUSH HOLDS NARROW LEAD  The latest USA Today/CNN/Gallup presidential preference poll gives Gov. George W. Bush a five-point lead over Vice President Al Gore, 49 percent to 44 percent. The poll also indicates that should Mr. Bush pick Senator John McCain of Arizona as his running mate, he would widen his lead. Among all voters, the poll found, 2 of 3 would not be more inclined to vote for Mr. Bush if Mr. McCain were added to the ticket. But among independents, 2 of 5 said they would be more inclined to vote for Mr. Bush with Mr. McCain on the ticket. The poll, which surveyed 1,003 likely voters from April 28 to 30, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five points. In a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll taken three weeks earlier, Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore by nine points.</p>
