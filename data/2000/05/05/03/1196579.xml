        <p>In the hours before they killed themselves in a fiery car crash in Monday's predawn darkness, Michael Dombrowski and Jeffrey Barton, two eighth-grade pals who were liked by many and understood by few, called their friends on a cell phone to say goodbye.</p>
        <p>But for reasons that police investigators and school administrators are still trying to fathom, none of the teenagers who received the calls reported them to the police or the boys' parents, though Michael had been making increasingly overt suicide threats in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>''He promised a lot of people he wouldn't do it,'' said a 14-year-old girl whom Michael and Jeff called before they died.</p>
        <p>After speaking with several friends on the cell phone, the boys apparently drove an old Ford Bronco owned by Michael's father down winding Route 151, past their two-story red-brick school, and aimed the speeding sport utility vehicle at a thick Norwegian spruce tree towering in front of the First Church of Christ.</p>
        <p>It was the same tree where Michael's older brother, Daniel, was killed about six months earlier in a car accident along with another 15-year-old boy.</p>
        <p>It is not known exactly when Michael's and Jeff's car struck the tree. When the first state trooper arrived at the scene, at 3:23 a.m. on Monday, the Bronco was engulfed in flames so intense that state investigators needed dental records to identify the seared bodies of both boys today. Michael was 13 and Jeffrey was 15, the police said.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Michael had grown alarmingly despondent over his brother's sudden death, friends said today. He had told his friends for weeks that he would kill himself, then backed away from the threats, they said.</p>
        <p>Jeff had moved here a year ago and had a longer history of emotional problems, school counselors said. He and Michael, perhaps in a bond of emotional suffering, had begun to hang around together about six weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Workers cut down the spruce tree on Monday, after church officials expressed concern that its mere presence would induce other young people to commit copycat suicides. For now, the residents of this rural town along the Connecticut River, where trees outnumber cars and yards are enclosed by ancient-looking stone fences, are trying to figure out why, given all the warnings, no one stopped the two boys.</p>
        <p>''Why wouldn't they say anything?'' said Eva Bunnell, who lives across the street from the six-inch stump where the spruce stood. ''If the kids made as many calls as people are saying, that almost sounds like a cry for help.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bunnell said her 16-year-old son knew Michael and Jeff, and her 13-year-old niece, Nicky, had been particularly good friends with Michael, whom she described as an outgoing, playful and -- at least outwardly -- well-adjusted boy.</p>
        <p>''They did real kids' stuff together,'' Ms. Bunnell said. ''They'd paint their feet and walk over the pavement.''</p>
        <p>Michael had recently painted Nicky's fingernails, she said, and they jokingly argued last week about who loved Doritos chips more. (Nicky did, they decided.) They had even begun talking about how to spend the last day of classes, June 13, together, Ms. Bunnell said.</p>
        <p>She, like many other town residents interviewed today -- many of whom refused to give their names -- knew Michael, a lifelong resident of East Haddam, and was aware of the torment that had haunted him since his brother died in November.</p>
        <p>Jeff's emotional pain was more mysterious and entrenched, school officials said. Both boys had been referred to professional therapists by trained counselors at Nathan Hale-Ray Middle School, said Cynthia Russo, a school counselor there.</p>
        <p>''They had actually gotten better within the past week or two,'' she said. ''With Mike, I don't know if I would say we were making progress; we were just staying stable. With Jeff, it seemed things were getting better.''</p>
        <p>''We were there for them,'' Ms. Russo said. ''When it became past our expertise, we referred them out.''</p>
        <p>Kimberly Mawson, 29, who stood outside her home near the middle school today talking with four students, said that Michael and Jeff had been on the phone with a female friend of theirs as the two boys barreled toward the spruce tree. ''They were on the phone when they hit the tree,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The first call Michael made in the hours before the suicide was to a 14-year-old female classmate, who spoke today on the condition that her name not be printed. ''I picked up the phone and he's, like, 'Goodbye,' '' the girl said today, standing among several friends. ''I said, 'Where are you going?' and he said, 'I love you.' And then he hung up.''</p>
        <p>She did not alert the police, she said, because Michael had made her promise not to tell anyone.</p>
        <p>Other friends were quoted in The Hartford Courant today as saying that they tried to call the boys back, but could not get through.</p>
        <p>The state police are investigating phone calls between the two boys and their friends, and whether the boys used an accelerant to make the car explode upon impact, said Sgt. J. Paul Vance of the state police. East Haddam does not have its own Police Department.</p>
        <p>Steven M. Durham, the superintendent of the East Haddam School District, said he did not know ''why youngsters weren't more vocal about what their friends were doing.''</p>
        <p>''Were there signs that we perhaps could have seen that could have helped us intervene?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>He said the boys' suicide had left the town stunned, especially after the November accident that killed Michael's brother and another boy, Hunter Daniels.</p>
        <p>''We were starting to feel better about things,'' he said. ''This accident just resurrects a lot of those feelings.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''Four young people in six months is more than a community should have to deal with.''</p>
        <p>Dr. David Shaffer, a psychiatry and pediatrics professor at Columbia University, said dramatic suicides of this type, performed at the site where a loved one died or on the anniversary of such a death, were extremely rare.</p>
        <p>''The fact that they told so many people and that they chose that location and converted it into a kind of symbolic event clearly shows they were trying to make a statement of some kind,'' said Dr. Shaffer, who is president of the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention. ''They didn't want their suicide to go unnoticed.''</p>
        <p>But, he added, they way the boys killed themselves seemed to indicate that they had made up their minds. ''I don't think there's much the other kids could have done.''</p>
        <p>Tragically, he said, the two boys are part of a growing trend: youths who kill themselves. Suicides among children 10 to 14 years old increased by 109 percent from 1980 to 1997, he said. For young people 15 to 24, suicide is the third-leading cause of death, after unintentional injury and homicide. Most are a result of mental illness, he said.</p>
        <p>Neither boy's family could be reached for comment by telephone today. Many of the people, especially teenagers, approached by newspaper and television reporters today expressed anger at the media spectacle their town and school had become.</p>
        <p>''We don't deserve them being here,'' said a 14-year-old girl whose parents refused to allow her name to be printed in this article. ''They should all leave. Don't you think it hurts us enough to see you here?''</p>
        <p>A high school student, angry at being approached by a reporter, warned that other teenagers would fend off further questions with their fists.</p>
        <p>''People don't want to think about that,'' said a furious young man who entered Mr. Durham's offices this afternoon to chastise a Hartford television news crew. ''We want to remember the good times.''</p>
