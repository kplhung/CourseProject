        <p>The fire-engine-red escalators and stark black walls that once set the tone for the five-story atrium lobby at 875 Third Avenue in Manhattan are now a gentle, grayish off-white, and the cold granite elevator banks have been covered with a warm light-brown paneling of anegre wood from Africa.</p>
        <p>The changes are part of a $6 million interior and exterior renovation of the office building -- a 29-story, 691,000-square-foot tower between 52nd and 53rd Streets -- that is meant to make the lobby more light-filled, modern and inviting, and attract tenants for 325,000 square feet of mostly contiguous space available for occupancy in October 2001.</p>
        <p>''It was one of the many office buildings put up in Manhattan in the 1980's that had aged quickly over the years,'' said Richard Metsky, a partner at Beyer Blinder Belle, the architect for the renovation. ''It was an interestingly designed building with a lot of potential, and we were intrigued with the possibility of enhancing it and replacing the older materials with more elegant ones.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Metsky said he sought to change the image of the building through simple, subtle architectural improvements. ''The lobby used to be oppressive and dark,'' he said. ''The escalators were the focal point, and because the space was painted black, you didn't even want to walk in, and you didn't realize it was a five-story atrium. We removed all the red, which was a tired color. The shades of white and gray let a lot more light spill in and make the space friendlier and more inviting.''</p>
        <p>The renovation, about 95 percent complete, gives the building two things it never had, he said -- a concierge space in the lobby and a marquee entryway on the 53rd Street corner. ''The building never had a front door,'' he said. ''Now we have a large canopy presence, so everyone knows where the front door is.''</p>
        <p>The building, completed in 1982, was designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill's Chicago office, and was one of the more unusual office buildings in New York: a 14-sided structure whose long axis was turned at a 45-degree angle to the avenue. One reason for the unusual design, and for the original lack of a ''front door,'' is that the building had to be constructed around four small tenement buildings whose long-term leaseholders would not come to terms with the developer, Madison Equities. The 45-degree angle created a notch to accommodate the tenements.</p>
        <p>In 1990, Robert Gladstone, a partner in Madison Equities, recalled that one of the tenants, Ryan's liquor store, had wanted more than $20 million to vacate its building before its lease ran out in 1992. (Ryan's was finally bought out in 1988 for $3 million, he said; the tenements were razed in 1990, and the replacements included an open-air granite-paved plaza and a planting area.)</p>
        <p>The 325,000 square feet available at 875 Third Avenue -- the 4th floor, the 15th through 17th, and the 20th through part of the 27th floor -- is occupied by the law firm of Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, which has leased space at 919 Third Avenue, between 55th and 56th Streets. The 919 Third Avenue space became available because another law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, decided to lease space at 4 Times Square, the Conde Nast Building.</p>
        <p>Robert E. Selsam, senior vice president and manager of the New York office of Boston Properties, which owns 875 Third Avenue, said he was ''close to a deal'' with yet another law firm -- he declined to name it -- for 135,000 square feet, including a three-story atrium from the 25th through 27th floors. Floor sizes run from 26,000 to 29,000 square feet. The building has two other atriums, from the 18th through 20th floors and 10th through 14th floors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Selsam said there were ''several prospects'' for the rest of the available space, among them financial services companies, law firms and dot-coms. Insignia/ESG is the leasing agent for the building.</p>
        <p>Boston Properties bought the building in 1997 for $205 million. The company, a real estate investment trust headed by Mortimer B. Zuckerman, owns 136 commercial properties in New York, Boston, Washington, San Francisco and Baltimore. Its holdings include the Embarcadero Center in San Francisco, Prudential Center in Boston and 280 Park Avenue in New York, and it is building an office tower in Times Square.</p>
        <p>Mr. Selsam said that when Boston Properties bought 875 Third Avenue, ''we thought that it was a great building but that it had just not reached its potential, that it had never been finished.''</p>
        <p>Annual rents for the available space, Mr. Selsam said, are expected to be in the $60's per square foot, which is at the higher end of the Third Avenue market. ''And,'' he said, ''the rents should be significantly higher at the top of the building.''</p>
