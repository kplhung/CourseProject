        <p>Snuck In was withdrawn from the Kentucky Derby today after a fast but unruly workout and, on the eve of the post-position draw, the outside gates may be in demand for the 126th running of the race on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Steve Asmussen, the trainer of Snuck In, the Arkansas Derby runner-up, decided not to enter the colt following a swift 59-second breeze at five furlongs. The time was crisp, but Asmussen was not pleased with how Snuck In repeatedly tossed his head and fought his exercise rider, Krissie Knorr.</p>
        <p>After discussing it with the owners, Bob and Lee Ackerley of Ackerley Brothers Farms, they decided to wait until the Preakness.</p>
        <p>''This work wasn't exactly what I wanted,'' Asmussen said of Snuck In, who missed training time over the winter with an abscessed hoof. ''We know he's fast. But the style he has now is not the style to be successful in a race like the Kentucky Derby. He needs to take a deep breath and relax. You don't see horses in an argument early in the Derby who are there at the end.''</p>
        <p>The colt's withdrawal means Godolphin's China Visit will probably make what is expected to be a full 20-horse field. With no graded stakes earnings, the Dubai-based colt came here hoping for defections. He has picked up two victories in his only official starts, though he recently won a trial race in Dubai.</p>
        <p>''It would be very disappointing to come all the way here and not get in,'' said China Visit's assistant trainer, Tom Albertrani, who was here last year with Worldly Manner for Godolphin. ''It's always exciting to be here and race and be a part of it. He's a good horse. It's nice to see a horse progress at different levels and stepping up one race at a time. He's going from two races to the Kentucky Derby. We know he is a good horse, and I believe he will run a creditable race.''</p>
        <p>It looks as if the stable will not get its second horse, Curule, into the Derby, and Carl Nafzger's Unshaded will also be left without a post. The Unbridled gelding won the Lexington Stakes on April 22 and has been sharp in workouts. He was not nominated for the Triple Crown and, if a spot opened, his owners would have to pay a $180,000 supplemental fee.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to worry about a situation I have no control over,'' said Nafzger, who has his sights set on the Travers Stakes in August at Saratoga. ''If it opens up for us to make the top 20, good. If it doesn't, that's life.''</p>
        <p>Post Position Poker</p>
        <p>When the post positions are drawn today in a two-tiered system intended to create television interest, look for trainers to send their horses to the outside: three of the last five Kentucky Derby winners have raced from the auxiliary gate, including the 1999 winner, Charismatic, who broke from post No. 16. The trainers must draw a low number to get an advantageous draft selection.</p>
        <p>In the first draw, for example, if the early favorite, Fusaichi Pegasus, draws the No. 1, then his trainer, Neil Drysdale, will choose his post from the 20 spots.</p>
        <p>After a roughly ridden race in last year's full field and plenty of speed going postward on Saturday, the trainer Todd Pletcher is looking for middle-to-outside spots for his four horses -- More Than Ready, Graeme Hall, Trippi and Impeachment. ''It looks like when the gates spring, the momentum pinballs everyone inside,'' he said. ''You can get squeezed or roughed up pretty early. If you're outside you have a better chance of staying clear.''</p>
        <p>D. Wayne Lukas agrees. The trainer of Charismatic, last year's Derby winner, is looking for his fifth Kentucky Derby winner and believes his top colt and front-runner, High Yield, will be better served from the outside, where he also won with Thunder Gulch from post 16 in 1995 and Grindstone from post 15 in 1996.</p>
        <p>''You can win it from anywhere,'' Lukas said. ''The one thing I definitely don't want is a couple of young jockeys who aren't proven in this race on either side of me.''</p>
        <p>Blinkers Off Captain Steve</p>
        <p>Captain Steve, who won the Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes at Churchill Downs last fall, continued to look better than his record this year has indicated. The chestnut colt, owned and trained by the team that won the 1998 Derby with Real Quiet -- Mike Pegram and Bob Baffert -- skipped over the oval in an effortless 592/5  seconds.</p>
        <p>It was the second time the colt, who has not won this year, worked without blinkers, but this time by design. Last week, Baffert forgot to put the equipment on before a workout. Now Captain Steve will abandon them altogether after seven starts.</p>
        <p>''He worked great,'' Baffert said. ''He worked today without blinkers and he'll run Saturday without them. The last couple of times he ran, the riders said he seemed to get edgy and a little hot going to the gate. So we took the blinkers off for his workout the other day and left them off again today. He's more focused now with the racing experience he's had and I don't think he needs them anymore. He's more relaxed without the blinkers.''</p>
