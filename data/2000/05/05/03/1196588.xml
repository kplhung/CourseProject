        <p>Albert Dixon III, 18, thought he was dreaming when he was awakened at 7 on a March morning by an admissions officer calling from Williams College. She informed him that a thick letter announcing his acceptance was on its way, as was a free round-trip ticket to the campus, just to check out Williams one more time.</p>
        <p>But his decision was more complicated. Mr. Dixon, who hopes to become a history teacher, had received a lucrative offer of free tuition from Morehouse College, a historically black institution in Atlanta. (Williams had offered him only loans.)</p>
        <p>And then there was Wesleyan University, which had used a softer sell -- a call of good wishes from a current student -- but had urged him to attend a celebration last month for accepted seniors.</p>
        <p>He left the Middletown, Conn., campus for his San Francisco home smitten with the thick French fries in the cafeteria and moved by an impromptu discussion of the Holocaust that began after a videotape snapped in the middle of a history class.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Dixon, who had spent the better part of a year pleading with colleges to accept him, the role reversal was jarring.</p>
        <p>The 30 days from April 1, when such offers are generally proffered, to May 1, when such decisions are due, is a time unlike any other in the college admissions season, at least for a select group of several thousand students. They become the decision makers, screening potential candidates against a yardstick of their own idiosyncrasies, while the officers are reduced to supplicants, promoting their schools as they brace for rejections from many of those they wanted most.</p>
        <p>''It is a courting period,'' said Rafael Figueroa, an associate dean of admissions at Wesleyan. ''You're telling them, 'This could go places. We could have a great thing, you and me.' Then they turn around and tell you, 'Have a nice life. I'm going to Brown.' ''</p>
        <p>Little wonder, then, that Mr. Dixon -- who is black and whose high College Board score of 1480, out of 1600, belied his B average -- felt like a prized athlete throughout April, so often was he plied with messages from admissions officers, professors and students at the six universities where he was accepted.</p>
        <p>Only the most sought-after candidates to top colleges receive plane tickets from faraway places, but, as is the case at dozens of colleges, all 1,850 students accepted at Wesleyan were to have received at least one follow-up call, if not several, because a letter of admission is no longer regarded as sufficient.</p>
        <p>This admissions season was the most competitive for the nation's elite colleges, including Wesleyan, a lush-green liberal arts college where enough students applied to fill the 715-member Class of 2004 10 times. Flooding the class was an especially long pipeline of high school graduates, many of them convinced that attending a selective institution guaranteed success in life.</p>
        <p>But the proliferation of good applicants did not mean that Wesleyan could let the responses just roll in. Hedging their bets, many seniors like Mr. Dixon had applied to more than 10 colleges, which only served to elevate the students' anxiety -- and the institutions' -- as the students deliberated throughout April.</p>
        <p>The admissions officers, at Wesleyan as elsewhere, were uneasy because they were intent on engineering a student body that was a little better than last year's, to say nothing of those of rival schools -- with ''better'' defined to include students with high College Board scores, roots in minority communities, leadership skills, science aptitude and the ability to play the oboe or second base.</p>
        <p>Colleges like Wesleyan reason that assembling such a class can only elevate the experiences of students and faculty, while providing fringe benefits like a prouder alumni body (which may give more money) and perhaps a higher ranking in closely read college guidebooks.</p>
        <p>Indeed, it often seemed to admissions officers at Wesleyan, as at Amherst and Williams, that they were pursuing many of the same 1,500 teenagers.</p>
        <p>One of them is Jordan Goldman, 17, an aspiring writer from Staten Island who has already collaborated with the novelist Richard Price. All year, Mr. Goldman asked himself if he needed the imprint of an Ivy League institution like Brown, or whether he would be happier at a smaller, though still prestigious, university like Wesleyan.</p>
        <p>He also could not dismiss an alluring proposition from New York University, which dangled four trips to Europe as part of a study-abroad program.</p>
        <p>And Jannely Almonte, 18, a South Bronx resident who attends a New Jersey prep school on a scholarship, had to sift through nine acceptance letters from selective colleges, as well as financial aid packages.</p>
        <p>But it was the unending flurry of e-mail messages from professors and undergraduates that left her most confused: when she returned from a trip to Columbia University last week, she found a phone message from someone at Wesleyan encouraging her to call with any questions.</p>
        <p>''I feel like a Michael Jordan trading card from his rookie season,'' Ms. Almonte, who wants to study biology, said during a visit to Wesleyan last month. ''The schools are putting in a lot of effort to get me while I'm in mint condition.''</p>
        <p>''All the attention makes me feel good,'' she said. ''But I feel bad. I have to think of some way to let them down easy.''</p>
        <p>Many of the seniors worried that picking the wrong college might darken the rest of their lives, with some waiting until Monday night, within hours of the midnight deadline, to mail out their answers.</p>
        <p>''They really see this decision as monumental,'' said Stephen Singer, director of college counseling at Horace Mann School in the Bronx. ''You say to them, 'There's no way you can screw this decision up.' ''</p>
        <p>''It makes them feel better,'' he added. ''For a minute.''</p>
        <p>Wesleyan had been hoping to persuade 650 to 675 of the students it accepted to attend, leaving room to take as many as 50 others off the waiting list in May and June. (By yesterday, deposits from 656 were in hand, with perhaps two dozen more expected in today's mail.)</p>
        <p>Those taken off the waiting list will be chosen, in part, to ''correct imbalances'' in the class, whether on the football team, in science laboratories or among the ranks of Asian-American or Hispanic-American students, when their representation in the new class is compared with last year's, said Gregory Pyke, the senior associate dean of admissions.</p>
        <p>To insure that its acceptances were accepted, Wesleyan employed gestures as large as a phone call from a department chairman, to jottings as small as ''Come to Wes!'' and ''Yes!'', which the dean of admissions, Nancy Hargrave Meislahn, scribbled on all 1,550 letters of acceptance mailed out in late March. (About 300 other students had been accepted early.)</p>
        <p>The officers plotted every detail, including when a dean might contact a desirable student to make a pitch. (If the call came too early, would Wesleyan appear desperate? If it was too late, would Swarthmore have already gotten there?)</p>
        <p>They even hired a recent graduate to make e-mail contact on behalf of Wesleyan with ''hot prospects,'' making sure, for example, that a Jewish student knew how to reach the campus rabbi.</p>
        <p>To help the students deliberate, Wesleyan created a list-serve -- a mass e-mail directory in which a message posted by one registered applicant is automatically sent to all -- in which the accepted students counseled each other, joined by the occasional Wesleyan undergraduate.</p>
        <p>Reading the dispatches on the list-serve, in which 200 high school seniors posted as many as 400 messages a day, was like looking through a microscope. Late at night from home, the high school seniors dissected Wesleyan, along with Brown, Amherst, Williams, Vassar and Dartmouth, seeking to determine whether the number of Nobel laureates on the faculty (none at Wesleyan) was as important as whether dogs are permitted in residence halls (they are not).</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldman, the budding screenwriter, used the list-serve to hash out his own decision, agonizing for eight long pages on April 17 over whether he should choose Wesleyan, ''Ivy U.,'' ''Big City U.,'' or a college he identified as ''Unnamed Gorgeous Small Liberal Arts School.''</p>
        <p>In the final sentence, he revealed his decision: Wesleyan.</p>
        <p>What impressed him most, Mr. Goldman said, was that the university had allowed students to put up posters during the celebration for accepted applicants that took issue with the weekend being alcohol-free -- not because they supported underage drinking, but because they felt students might be getting a sanitized portrait. Mr. Goldman wrote that he was struck by the ''absolute free expression'' and that ''you won't find that at an Ivy League school.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldman, who was accepted by Johns Hopkins and Vassar, but not Brown or the University of Pennsylvania, was so persuasive that at least 25 seniors reported that his dispatch had made the difference in their own decisions.</p>
        <p>''I can retire,'' Mr. Figueroa said. ''Jordan can take over from here.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Almonte, the prep school student in New Jersey by way of the Bronx, managed in early April to jettison Trinity, Union College, the University of Rochester, Connecticut College and Haverford, leaving only Columbia and Wesleyan.</p>
        <p>Because her mother is a home health aide with a spare salary, she had expected to go with the best financial offer. Though Wesleyan and Columbia were close, Wesleyan was offering more money up front, with Columbia tying up more aid in loans.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Almonte, the daughter of Dominican immigrants who did not attend college, decided that an Ivy League education was too important to pass up.</p>
        <p>''My mother, my grandmother, my aunts and uncles, they always expect me to choose the best,'' she said. ''And according to their mind, Ivy League is the best.''</p>
        <p>Wesleyan also lost out on Katie Stockhammer, a straight-A soccer captain from Florida, who impressed the admissions committee in March by maintaining her grades while being treated for cancer. She chose Swarthmore, outside of Philadelphia, in part because it was closer to a big city.</p>
        <p>And what of Mr. Dixon, who felt like a three-pronged wishbone tugged by Morehouse, Williams and Wesleyan?</p>
        <p>Though Morehouse's offer of a free ride would have eased the financial burden on his father, an executive at a software company, Mr. Dixon and his father agreed that the education he would receive at Williams or Wesleyan would be superior.</p>
        <p>But which one?</p>
        <p>A week ago Sunday, over a slice of the special lemon pound cake that his mother had prepared for his birthday, Mr. Dixon summoned his parents to the kitchen table.</p>
        <p>''Williams is a school that most parents and teachers think is great, simply because it's rated high academically,'' Mr. Dixon explained. ''But socially, it's out in the middle of nowhere.''</p>
        <p>Wesleyan, he concluded, was not only more liberal and diverse, ''but in the classes I attended, even the kids I thought wouldn't be smart or intelligent in a conversation ended up having some pretty good things to say.''</p>
        <p>And then there were those Wesleyan French fries, which his dad remembered as fondly as he did.</p>
        <p>The younger Mr. Dixon decided to head back for four years' worth of second helpings.</p>
        <p>Admissions Maze</p>
        <p>Admission to elite colleges is more competitive than at any time in history. The New York Times asked Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., to give a reporter full access to its selection procedure. It did so, permitting him to read applications and attend admissions meetings, on the condition that applicants' identities not be revealed during the process.</p>
        <p>This is the third, and last, of the articles. The first article, which was published on Feb. 27, examined how admissions officers dealt with applications, and the second, in the newspaper of April 3, looked at the process of selecting those to be offered admission.
