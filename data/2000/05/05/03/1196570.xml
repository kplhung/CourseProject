        <p>Harold A Feiveson letter on Apr 28 article scores United States suggestion that Russia could counter proposed missile defense system by keeping its strategic arsenal on constant alert</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In the document that American negotiators presented to the Russians regarding amendments to the Antiballistic Missile Treaty (front page, April 28), the United States seeks to reassure Russia that Moscow could make ''an annihilating counterattack,'' even after a surprise American first strike, as long as it ''keeps its strategic arsenal on constant alert.''</p>
        <p>What an argument! To pave the way for deployment of a ballistic missile defense system, which among other purposes is meant to guard against accidental launching of a few Russian missiles, the United States encourages Russia to keep between 1,000 and 2,000 strategic warheads on constant alert.</p>

        <p>This is foolish. It is also an implicit admission that deployment of even a limited national ballistic missile defense system will make it far more difficult to reduce numbers of strategic weapons and the hair-trigger alert of the forces.</p>
