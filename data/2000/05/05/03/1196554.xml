        <p>Cross one of the bridges that spans the Ohio River and connects Kentucky to Ohio, and you will arrive in downtown Cincinnati, in view of a large construction site with huge cranes, slabs of concrete and busy workers blending like bees. It is a jungle down there. Paul Brown Stadium -- the Bengals' new $318 million home -- is nearly complete.</p>
        <p>Now to stick a blast of dynamite into the Bengals.</p>
        <p>This is a franchise that has not had a winning record in the past nine seasons and went 3-13 and 4-12 the past two years. During that span the Bengals have had three coaches (Sam Wyche, Dave Shula and Bruce Coslet), a slew of quarterbacks, a ton of unsuccessful draft picks, devastating injuries and controversy followed by more controversy.</p>
        <p>Last season, the Bengals trudged to an 0-4 start and began thinking about next year. The team president, Mike Brown, said then: ''It has been our worst nightmare, worse than imagined. We've got to go with the young guys; it makes no sense to go in the direction we're going in.''</p>
        <p>After the season, the Bengals let quarterback Jeff Blake flee to New Orleans and Blake offered this parting shot: ''I've felt the losing aura. I've been on a team where as soon as you walk in the facility, you can smell it.'' The Bengals are about to rid themselves of receiver Carl Pickens, who said of Coslet: ''Bruce has never had a winning record here or anywhere else so why would you bring him back?''</p>
        <p>Controversy, frustration, futility, embarrassment. Losing.</p>
        <p>None of this is lost on the current cast of Bengals.</p>
        <p>''Things have happened here,'' Coselt said. ''There has been a lot of the 'Here we go again' syndrome.''</p>
        <p>Last year, the Bengals used their second-round pick to draft a spiffy cornerback, Charles Fisher, from West Virginia. After a dozen or so plays in their season-opening game, he was out for the year because of a knee injury.</p>
        <p>''And from the sidelines last year,'' Fisher said, ''I could see the problems. A lot of breakdowns.''</p>
        <p>Offensive tackle Rod Jones said, ''When you're in the N.F.L., you've got to be proud of where you're at because the opportunities are few.'' That does not keep the Bengals from being jokes and fodder for their peers. They have been called the Black Hole of the N.F.L.</p>
        <p>They have the reputation for being thrifty, resulting in protracted contract holdouts with star players.</p>
        <p>''This is my third year here and we've been a team that once one or two things kind of negative happen, everybody on the team lets that take over.'' linebacker Brian Simmons said. ''Once that happens, you are already defeated.''</p>
        <p>Finally, the quarterback for this season, the man they hope will return the Bengals' home field to the Jungle, is Akili Smith. The third player selected in the draft a year ago, Smith talks as if he has been here for 10.</p>
        <p>''I look at this town and this team and I see a lot of people in a box,'' said Smith, who played at Oregon and grew up in San Diego. ''I see a lot of people struggling to get out of that box to explore more. Everybody walking through that door must know that we can't have another season like last year. We'd get behind in so many games by 10 points or more in the first quarter and guys would start hanging their heads and basically give up. We're talking about releasing some demons. The Bengals have been haunted by demons for the last 10 or 15 years.''</p>
        <p>Actually, the Bengals have been in two Super Bowls (1982 and 1989) and though both losses were to San Francisco, at least the Bengals have been -- there are a handful of National Football League franchises that have never had a whiff of the Super Bowl. Their fans came early and stayed late and their stadium became known as the Jungle, a frolicking place where running back Ickey Woods did his shuffle and where quarterback Boomer Esiason made his mark.</p>
        <p>Many trace the origin of the Bengals' struggles to the death in 1991 of their founder, Paul Brown. As the Bengals opened minicamp last week, Coslet pondered what has gone wrong for so long.</p>
        <p>''We've gone through quarterbacks here like it was nobody's business; I've never had the same starter two years in a row,'' he said. ''There has been no continuity in the offensive line. Injuries have hurt us. This is not sour grapes. And it hurts you if you dwell on it, so I have selective memory. You look at Ray Rhodes fired in Green Bay for going 8-8 in the first year of a five-year contract and I go 4-12 in my third year and I'm back. But it's no surprise to me. As a player and coach, I've been a Bengal off and on for 24 years. There is a sense of loyalty here. I've done the best with what I've had to work with. We've got better players now. We like our draft picks. Our offensive line returns intact for the first time. We've got strong linebacking. Our special teams hurt us and we've improved there. Akili will be the most important single player on our team.''</p>
        <p>Coslet is in the final year of his contract. If the Bengals make the playoffs his pact will automatically renew for another year.</p>
        <p>Real problems, though, remain. Pickens is in limbo; he will probably be traded or released. Ki-Jana Carter recently suffered another setback, another knee injury, and the oft-injured running back hopes to return when training camp opens. Running back Corey Dillon is a contract holdout, but Brown believes he will be signed.</p>
        <p>The draft produced Peter Warrick, the Florida State receiver, with the fourth pick over all. Many scouts rated Warrick the best player in the draft. That is Smith, a No. 3 pick, throwing to Warrick, a No. 4. That could be a signature connection.</p>
        <p>''Peter came into minicamp this week and showed a lot of exceptional things,'' Smith said. ''His quickness, his elusiveness. I threw one up there and I was impressed with the way he went up and got it. That was something I didn't know he could do. Don't forget about Darnay Scott and some of our other guys. We've got receivers. We've got runners and blockers. Our defense is better. There is great hope here.''</p>
        <p>Warrick said: ''I know how to play this game. I'm ready to play it.''</p>
        <p>And he will, immediately, as a starter. Coslet said that maybe the rest of the Bengals can learn what it takes to be champion from Warrick, who was dominant at the collegiate level in leading Florida State to the national championship last year. Coslet believes that Smith has that edge, too, that feel and style of a champion. Smith is being given the ball and the team. Run it.</p>
        <p>Smith played in seven games and started four last season before missing the last eight games with a toe injury. After the Bengals' 0-4 start, he made his first start against the expansion Cleveland Browns and won. Smith has been in Cincinnati since Feb. 14 working with Ken Anderson, the team's offensive coordinator. Smith said he will be there for most of the off-season. ''I'm not going anywhere for a while,'' he said. ''Basically, they are putting the franchise in my hands. I'm excited but I also know there is pressure that comes with being given the ball.''</p>
        <p>Brown has made changes. Bigger planes for travel. Breakfast is now served to the players and a PlayStation game for them to enjoy is available near the locker room. The new stadium and new practice fields are adjacent. Some of it is the little things that several N.F.L. teams have long offered.</p>
        <p>But, tight end Tim McGee said: ''You can sleep in silk pajamas but that doesn't guarantee you go out and create havoc on the field. It's about leadership and accountability. We're going to get behind Akili and build that.''</p>
        <p>Can the Bengals be this year's St. Louis Rams or Tennessee Titans, previously struggling teams that surged last season to the Super Bowl? The Bengals saw the Tennessee miracle lateral in the playoffs and watched as the Rams basically found their quarterback, Kurt Warner, in a supermarket. He was the league's most valuable player</p>
        <p>The Bengals, however, must plow their own new road.</p>
        <p>''You need some good fortune in this business -- you really do,'' Brown said. ''I hate to count up the losing for us because it's been too long and people have a way of reminding you; rarely is it pleasant. Every team in this league must fend for themselves, us included. But we like our chances with Akili. We have our hopes up. Can we cut it?''</p>
        <p>The Bengals say yes, only after they have dug deep.</p>
