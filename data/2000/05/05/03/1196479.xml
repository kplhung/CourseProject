        <p>A highly placed secretary at the New York City School Construction Authority has admitted that she used her influence to get a job for her husband as a project supervisor at a Brooklyn elementary school where a falling brick killed a girl two years ago, officials at the city's Conflicts of Interest Board said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The secretary, Frances T. Vella-Marrone, was the special assistant to Paul Atanasio, who was appointed to the three-member authority board by Gov. George E. Pataki.</p>
        <p>Mr. Atanasio stepped down in 1999 after sharp criticism from city and state investigators, in part for his role in the hiring of the secretary's husband, Gary Marrone, as a project supervisor to oversee work at Public School 131.</p>
        <p>As part of a settlement with the conflicts board, Mrs. Vella-Marrone confessed to violating the authority's rules against nepotism by helping to secure her husband a job and agreed to pay $5,000 to the conflicts board.</p>
        <p>Her lawyer, John J. D'Emic, said she would be unavailable for comment.</p>
        <p>The report, released last week by the Conflicts of Interest Board, marked the first time that Mrs. Vella-Marrone had spoken out on the incident, which further stained the reputation of the long-criticized School Construction Authority.</p>
        <p>The girl, Yan Zhen Zhao, 16, was struck by a falling brick on Jan. 9, 1998, outside P.S. 131. Mr. Marrone had been criticized by school administrators for his frequent absences from the site, according to findings from earlier investigations into the accident.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marrone failed to order the contractor to erect protective sidewalk sheds, as required by city law, investigators found. They also found that he had ordered that a security fence around the school be shortened, allowing access to the spot where the girl was killed.</p>
        <p>The accident prompted investigators to look into Mr. Marrone's background, which led to the conflict of interest investigation of Mrs. Vella-Marrone. Investigators found that Mr. Marrone had little construction experience and had been fired from his two previous supervisory jobs. The investigators concluded that his lax oversight at P.S. 131 made conditions ripe for the accident.</p>
        <p>But in yesterday's report, Mrs. Vella-Marrone strenuously defended her husband's experience.</p>
