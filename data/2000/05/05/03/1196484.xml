        <p>The Clinton administration said today that proposals to create an independent agency to run the Medicare program or to administer prescription drug benefits for the elderly were unwise and probably unconstitutional because the new entity would not be accountable to the president.</p>
        <p>Most Republicans in Congress and many Democrats want to reduce the authority of the agency that now runs Medicare, the Health Care Financing Administration. In carrying out laws passed over the last three decades, they say, it has become a heavy-handed regulator.</p>
        <p>Many of the leading proposals in Congress for Medicare coverage of prescription drugs would create a quasi-independent board, which would hire private entities to administer drug benefits under guidelines set by the government. Many lawmakers would like to give the board additional powers over Medicare in the future.</p>
        <p>But the Justice Department said such proposals ''would constitute an unwarranted and unwise erosion of the president's authority to oversee the functioning of the executive branch'' of government.</p>
        <p>''The proposed legislation raises serious constitutional concerns'' and ''poses a serious threat to the core constitutional values of political accountability and coordinated executive branch policy-making,'' the Justice Department said in a letter to Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia.</p>
        <p>The senator asked the department for its views in February.</p>
        <p>If the administration persists in its opposition to an independent board, it could seriously complicate Congressional efforts to offer drug benefits to the 39 million people on Medicare. Support for such a board appears to be growing on Capitol Hill. Many lawmakers have said they fear that if the Health Care Financing Administration is responsible for new drug benefits, it may eventually try to regulate drug prices as it has regulated doctors' fees and hospital payments under Medicare.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department expressed its views in a critique of legislation introduced by Senators John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, and Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee. The Medicare board in their bill was modeled, in part, after the Federal Reserve Board and other independent agencies.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Senator Breaux said he saw no basis for the Justice Department's concerns. The Medicare board, he said, would be outside the Department of Health and Human Services, but it would still be in the executive branch, like the Social Security Administration, which was removed from the department by a 1994 law.</p>
        <p>As envisioned in the Breaux-Frist bill, the Medicare board would be ''an independent agency of the United States.'' It would generally supervise the Medicare program and manage a competitive market in which health insurance plans vie with one another, and with the original fee-for-service Medicare program, to provide coverage to people who are elderly or disabled.</p>
        <p>The board would have seven members, appointed by the president for seven-year terms. The president could remove a member ''only for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office,'' the bill says. The Justice Department strenuously objected to this restriction on the president's power to dismiss board members.</p>
        <p>Mr. Breaux said, ''It's easy to construct a Medicare board that would meet constitutional requirements.'' If necessary, he said, the bill could be revised so board members would serve at the pleasure of the president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rockefeller, like the Clinton administration, opposes the idea of an independent Medicare board, saying it would create a new bureaucracy that is not accountable to either beneficiaries or taxpayers.</p>
        <p>''We cannot pass the buck,'' Mr. Rockefeller said. ''Removing Medicare from the accountability of Congress and the president amounts to an abdication of duty that would risk the health care of millions of America's seniors.''</p>
        <p>But aides to Senators Breaux and Frist said they had been assured by lawyers at the Congressional Research Service that the proposed Medicare board would not violate any provision of the Constitution.</p>
        <p>Proposals for Medicare drug benefits have already become an issue in many election campaigns this year. But Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said today, ''We want to work with President Clinton in a bipartisan fashion to make a prescription drug benefit under Medicare a reality, not a political bumper sticker.''</p>
