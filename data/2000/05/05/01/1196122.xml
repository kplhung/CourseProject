        <p>Editorial sees need for police authorities in newly democratic or peaceful nations to enact important reforms for crime-fighting that can also reduce police brutality, noting many often retain bad habits of predecessors</p>

        <p>Last year in South Africa, more than 550 people died at the hands of the police. Statistics for the apartheid era are weak, but the numbers indicate that the police are more deadly today than they were during most of the last 25 years of apartheid. The recent victims, of course, are criminal suspects, not political activists.

        <p>One of the mistakes governments and international peacekeepers make after a transition is attempting to build a new police force with veteran policemen. In Guatemala's new police, supervised by the United Nations, long-serving policemen make up virtually the entire command structure, and there has been no systematic screening to keep out the abusive. Ninety percent of South Africa's new police officers served under apartheid. These officers have spent their careers repressing dissent and know little about fighting crime or being accountable to citizens.</p>

        <p>Last year in South Africa, more than 550 people died at the hands of the police. Statistics for the apartheid era are weak, but the numbers indicate that the police are more deadly today than they were during most of the last 25 years of apartheid. The recent victims, of course, are criminal suspects, not political activists. But in newly democratic or newly peaceful nations, police often retain many of the habits of their predecessors, including shooting suspects or, less often, beating them to death. A new government, it seems, does not automatically bring new police practices.</p>
        <p>One of the mistakes governments and international peacekeepers make after a transition is attempting to build a new police force with veteran policemen. In Guatemala's new police, supervised by the United Nations, long-serving policemen make up virtually the entire command structure, and there has been no systematic screening to keep out the abusive. Ninety percent of South Africa's new police officers served under apartheid. These officers have spent their careers repressing dissent and know little about fighting crime or being accountable to citizens.</p>
        <p>Some countries retain these officers because they are too powerful to dismiss. It is also hard to retire large numbers of police at once because training new ones takes time. Haiti's new police, for example, got only four months of training. In every nation emerging from war or dictatorship a more representative police force means hiring members of marginalized groups with little education.</p>
        <p>Another factor that contributes to police brutality is the crime wave that often comes after a war or dictatorship ends. In South Africa, many of the criminals are young men who were raised in communities that considered violence a legitimate response to an oppressive government.</p>
        <p>Crime begets police violence in several ways. Police feel they are under siege -- and often they are right. In South Africa, hundreds of police officers have been shot, in many cases by criminals hoping to get their weapons. Crime overwhelms fragile justice systems, which can induce police to administer their own form of rough justice. Citizens begin to call for hard-line responses, and public tolerance for police abuses rises.</p>
        <p>The two most important reforms for crime-fighting can also help to reduce police brutality. One is training in effective police methods. Police often use force because they do not know how to control crowds, apprehend suspects or solve crimes any other way. The other reform is to show police that their first job is to earn the trust of citizens, something that is essential because most crimes are solved when people in the community come forward with information. To do this, the police should represent the nation's ethnic mix. Police forces should establish channels for talking to people, and spend their time in street patrols, not in the station house. Police departments must have effective mechanisms for disciplining brutal cops. Police in new democracies need to embrace these practices not as public-relations measures but as the core of their new mission, which is to protect the public.</p>
