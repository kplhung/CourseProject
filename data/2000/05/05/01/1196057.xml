        <p>In its first season of rotating repertory the Pearl Theater Company is pairing ''The Way of the World'' by William Congreve with ''The Oresteia'' by Aeschylus, the three plays of the Greek trilogy presented as acts of a single production. Given the stature of the trilogy in the history of Western drama, this is somewhat like listing Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle as a one-day presentation in an opera repertory. ''The Oresteia'' is, of course, shorter than that. And, fortunately, ambition is not the only virtue to applaud in this rare undertaking.</p>
        <p>The story certainly has a grand sweep. The first play is ''Agamemnon,'' named for the leader of the triumphant Greek forces who returns home from the Trojan War with the captive Princess Cassandra in chains. His wife, Clytemnestra, is still furious that, without so much as consulting her, he offered their daughter Iphigenia as a human sacrifice to get safe passage for the Greek fleet at the war's outset. To avenge her daughter, she traps Agamemnon in a straitjacket disguised as a robe and, with the help of his kinsman Aegisthus, kills him.</p>

        <p>In its first season of rotating repertory the Pearl Theater Company is pairing ''The Way of the World'' by William Congreve with ''The Oresteia'' by Aeschylus, the three plays of the Greek trilogy presented as acts of a single production. Given the stature of the trilogy in the history of Western drama, this is somewhat like listing Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle as a one-day presentation in an opera repertory. ''The Oresteia'' is, of course, shorter than that. And, fortunately, ambition is not the only virtue to applaud in this rare undertaking.</p>
        <p>The story certainly has a grand sweep. The first play is ''Agamemnon,'' named for the leader of the triumphant Greek forces who returns home from the Trojan War with the captive Princess Cassandra in chains. His wife, Clytemnestra, is still furious that, without so much as consulting her, he offered their daughter Iphigenia as a human sacrifice to get safe passage for the Greek fleet at the war's outset. To avenge her daughter, she traps Agamemnon in a straitjacket disguised as a robe and, with the help of his kinsman Aegisthus, kills him.</p>
        <p>Next, in ''The Libation Bearers,'' Orestes, the son of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, returns from self-exile years later and, aided by his sister Electra, kills Clytemnestra and Aegisthus to avenge his father. In the third play, called ''The Furies'' in the translation used here but more commonly known as ''The Eumenides'' (''Kind Spirits''), the god Apollo clears Orestes of guilt for murder, but Orestes is pursued by the Furies, traditional hellhounds of vengeance, to the temple of Athena in Athens where his case is presented to the citizens.</p>
        <p>When they divide evenly on the vote to convict or acquit, Athena breaks the tie in his favor. She persuades the Furies to abandon vengeance forever and to occupy a cave under Athens as benign demigods who join the Athenians in bringing disputes over moral conduct under a rule of justice that can be understood by, and participated in, by all humanity.</p>
        <p>Some of his rivals later in the 5th century B.C. ridiculed Aeschylus for his lofty language and Olympian views, but the trilogy is one of Greece's finest intellectual heritages. Most of the roles are types rather than individuals, but the breaking of the relentless and often religiously dictated march of family vengeance is enthrallingly dramatic. And along the way Aeschylus, a veteran of the battles of Marathon and Salamis, which saved Greece from Persian tyranny, has some fun teasing his civilian audience about pompous war heroes (Agamemnon) and about baffling military technologies like communication over unimaginable distances by hilltop beacons.</p>
        <p>And he does create three magnificent characters: the implacable Clytemnestra; Orestes' old nurse, who has inspired stage imitators for 2,500 years; and the chorus of Athenians in the last play, who make up a single, unforgettably eloquent character.</p>
        <p>The playwright's taste for spectacle, music and dance was notorious; performance of the three plays surely took a day. Under Shepard Sobel's direction, the Pearl's apparently tireless cast gets through them all in three hours. The meters of the Greek text let one hear the rhythm of the ancient dances, and some viewers might wish there were more spectacle here. But even in this very prosy translation the compression of the action turns the battle of ideas into gripping combat, and in the first and third plays the suppleness and variety of voices in the Greek chorus is something the audience can easily feel; they speak for us and occasionally we want to cheer them on, especially during the verbal duels between Clytemnestra and the chorus in ''Agamemnon.''</p>
        <p>Unaccountably, the chorus in this version of ''The Libation Bearers'' is so shrill, and so inept in a brief effort to sing a few lines, that it drains some force from the play. And a few effects seem very ill-advised: the garment used to trap Agamemnon is a net that might snare a rhinoceros in full gallop, so huge that not even this vain king could have been tricked into its meshes. And it is a mistake to make the Furies a trio of oddballs resembling the Sand People in ''Star Wars.'' To the popular Greek imagination there was nothing fuzzy about these fierce pests; their transformation at the end must have seemed like a vision of salvation.</p>
        <p>Those and a few other grumbles aside, this production is a revelation. When Clytemnestra stands over her dead husband declaring ''what we did had to be done'' and Orestes then straddles her body saying he feels like a charioteer whose horse is so out of control that ''I do not know how it will end,'' the terror of madness seizes the audience and Aeschylus' appeal to reason is sublime.</p>
