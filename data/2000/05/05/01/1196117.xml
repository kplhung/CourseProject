        <p>Somewhere, Miami Coach Pat Riley is probably whipping up quotations containing the word destiny. Because it is that time of year again.</p>
        <p>It is a time when the Heat and the Knicks have their annual spring date. It is a time when the blossoms bloom and a rivalry grows. As a rite of passage through the playoffs, the Knicks will play the Heat in Game 1 of their four-of-seven-game second-round series on Sunday at American Airlines Arena in Miami.</p>
        <p>''The Knicks in seven,'' predicted the former Knick Charles Oakley after his old team eliminated his Raptors by completing a sweep today at the Air Canada Center. ''That's just what I believe.''</p>
        <p>It always comes down to a dramatic finish. In two of their previous three playoff meetings, the Knicks have come out the winners. This time, the fourth year in a row Miami and the Knicks have found each other in the playoffs, Coach Jeff Van Gundy is already issuing the kind of preseries statements he did before the Knicks played the Raptors.</p>
        <p>''Miami beat us three times this year,'' said Van Gundy, whose team also had a 1-3 regular-season record against Toronto. ''It's quite a rivalry. In the past there have been fights, talk and rhetoric. But it has developed into a mutual respect. They have had home-court advantage. I'm sure it will be very hot and heated.''</p>
        <p>It will be a replay of so many familiar story lines. You can start with the Georgetown reunion of Patrick Ewing and Alonzo Mourning. If Ewing is to grab his elusive title, he will have to get by Mourning.</p>
        <p>''It's not about me against Zo,'' Ewing said. ''It's about Miami and the Knicks. I don't think I have Zo's number. We're a good team. They're a good team. I want to win a championship, and they're in our way.''</p>
        <p>Ewing's matchup with Mourning is only one subplot. Will Heat guard Tim Hardaway be healthy? Will Allan Houston have his touch? Fresh off his defensive performance against Toronto's Vince Carter, Latrell Sprewell will face a very different counterpart: a bulky Jamal Mashburn.</p>
        <p>''All I know is I'm undefeated against them,'' said Sprewell, referring to his one and only series victory against the Heat last year. ''I'm very excited. It's probably the biggest rivalry in basketball. I don't know if there is another one bigger.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks have a week to prepare for the Heat, for Van Gundy to scour his brain for the kind of successful strategies he unveiled against the Raptors. But what else is new?</p>
        <p>''It's the same players against the same players,'' Houston said. ''We always end up facing each other. We have to capitalize on what we didn't do in the regular season. We have to come ready to play well.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks' sweep of Toronto a day after the Heat swept Detroit allows the teams virtually the same amount of rest.</p>
        <p>''We didn't want Miami to get ahead of us in that respect,'' Ewing said. ''We need 15 wins to be a champion. Now we have three down.''</p>
