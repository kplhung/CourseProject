        <p>Waving banners of gay pride and identity, a crowd estimated in the hundreds of thousands rallied in the nation's capital today, celebrating the gains of the gay rights movement in recent years and vowing redoubled efforts on issues like hate crime legislation.</p>
        <p>One leader after another urged the crowd to demonstrate its influence at the ballot box in November. For more than six hours, under a warm spring sun, a wide range of speakers, including the parents of Matthew Shepard, the Wyoming gay college student whose beating death galvanized the drive for laws against hate crimes, addressed the unfinished agenda of the gay rights movement.</p>
        <p>''Let people know you are a part of America, you are a solid God-fearing part of America, and you deserve the same rights,'' said Dennis Shepard, Matthew's father.</p>
        <p>There was a strong political subtext to the day. Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian organization, told the audience, ''We must elect Al Gore as president of the United States,'' arguing that ''the very future of the U.S. Supreme Court for the next generation hangs in the balance.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Birch said of Gov. George W. Bush's position on gay rights issues: ''There is absolutely nothing about these policies that is compassionate.''</p>
        <p>Vice President Gore, addressing the group by videotape beamed on a huge screen above the Mall, declared, ''I stand with you, and am with you every step of the way'' in the march for civil rights.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said he would not rest in the fight against AIDS and in the struggle to protect gay Americans from employment discrimination and to ensure that ''crimes of hate against all people, including gays and lesbians,'' are severely punished.</p>
        <p>President Clinton, also speaking by videotape, said he had created the ''most inclusive'' administration in history, with more than 150 openly gay men and lesbians as appointees, and would ''continue our fight for an employment nondiscrimination act that would ban discrimination against gays and lesbians in the workplace.''</p>
        <p>But there was more than electoral politics to the day; there was a broader, more festive tone. The marchers, who began to wind from the Washington Monument to the  Capitol at 10:20 a.m., were a long, ebullient parade of cops and veterans, drag queens and college students, gay parents with toddlers on their backs and heterosexual parents marching in support of gay children.</p>
        <p>Their signs and banners, some carefully designed and mass produced, some homemade, reflected the diversity: ''Proud Son of a Lesbian.'' ''Protect Our Families.'' ''Stop Hate Crimes.'' ''Ohio Gay Officers Action League.'' ''Gay Veterans of Chicago.'' ''Proud to be from Vermont.''</p>
        <p>There were several variations on Vermont signs. The state, which recently passed a bill creating civil unions that give gay couples the rights of marriage, was praised and trumpeted throughout the day.</p>
        <p>As the organizers hoped, there were many families here. Larry Leon was pushing his 22-month-old twins in a double-stroller with his partner, Marc Salans, and carrying a sign that demanded, ''Keep Gay Adoption Legal.'' Mr. Leon, who lives in Washington, said, ''We want to celebrate our family, celebrate the joy of having a family, celebrate the success of our adoption endeavor.''</p>
        <p>Susan from North Carolina, who declined to give her last name, said she, her partner and their 17-month-old daughter were ''just marching for our family.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Birch, of the Human Rights Campaign, described her and her partner's adoption of twins and told the crowd, ''Don't let anybody tell you that you're not worthy of parenthood.''</p>
        <p>There were tiny clusters of protesters. As the march began, a man with a bullhorn shouted, ''Sick! Sick! Sick!'' The marchers chanted back, ''Shame! Shame! Shame!'' Another protester yelled: ''You're despicable before God. You know nothing about families.'' And a marcher shouted back, ''Jesus loves me.''</p>
        <p>But by and large, the march had the air of a vast street festival, fed by the array of entertainers and celebrities, from Melissa Etheridge to Martina Navratilova, who took the stage at the foot of the Capitol. Anne Heche, the actress, declared from the stage, ''I gotta say I was straight for 27 years and I never came to a party as big as this.''</p>
        <p>The march came under criticism from some gay activists, who argued that the planning was not inclusive enough, that the organizers had allowed too much commercialization with sponsors like United Airlines and Showtime Network and that the purpose of the march was ill-defined.</p>
        <p>One critic, Bill Dobbs, with the Ad Hoc Committee for an Open Process, said today: ''Rather than unite and galvanize the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community, the march's organizers and the Human Rights Campaign have created divisions. That rift, about who speaks for the movement and how decisions are made, must be addressed before we can move forward.''</p>
        <p>But Dianne Hardy-Garcia, executive director of the Millennium March on Washington, as today's rally was called, said that taking such a strong, visible stand for equality in an election year ''is smart -- and a judicious use of resources.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hardy-Garcia said the march was intended to show the generational and geographic range of the movement, its growing numbers of openly gay families and its ability to build coalitions. ''I think there was an image that we were only an urban gay community,'' she said.</p>
        <p>One of those coalitions was demonstrated on the stage today, when the family of Matthew Shepard was joined by the family of James Byrd Jr., a black man who was dragged to death behind a truck by three whites in Jasper, Tex.</p>
        <p>Many of those here today said they hoped their presence would send a signal. When asked why she was here, a New York City police sergeant replied: ''Strength in numbers. Pride. For some people, it's a life-altering event.''</p>
        <p>This was the first national gay rights march in Washington since 1993. Organizers gave various estimates of the crowd size as the day progressed, asserting that at its peak, it was 800,000; the United States Park Police no longer issues crowd estimates, which had become an unending source of debate with the organizers of various marches.</p>
