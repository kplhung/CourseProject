      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Turkey's Parliament can send a hopeful signal about the country's political future by electing Judge Ahmet Necdet Sezer as the country's next president. In Turkey's political system, the president is far less powerful than the prime minister. But he helps set the tone of political life, and Judge Sezer, who currently leads Turkey's highest constitutional court, would be an excellent choice.</p>
        <p>In the past year Judge Sezer has become an outspoken advocate of eliminating or easing Ankara's chilling antiterror and antiseparatist laws. These have been used to jail hundreds of politicians, intellectuals and journalists, and to suppress peaceful debate on Kurdish issues. He has also called for allowing appeals of military court rulings and permitting the teaching of the Kurdish language. Such changes would go far toward making Turkey a healthier democracy as it prepares for future membership in the European Union.</p>

        <p>In the past year Judge Sezer has become an outspoken advocate of eliminating or easing Ankara's chilling antiterror and antiseparatist laws.

Such changes would go far toward making Turkey a healthier democracy as it prepares for future membership in the European Union.</p>
        <p>Judge Sezer's public opposition to Turkey's restrictive laws is relatively recent, but apparently heartfelt, and his candidacy has stirred hope among Kurds and other victims of legal persecution. Judge Sezer has been backed by all major party leaders, but he fell short of the required two-thirds majority in a first round of voting last week. Turkey's legislators should give him a winning margin in today's second round.</p>
