        <p>As dusk obscured the orange trees and rose bushes in the courtyard, a group of solemn women pulled off their head  scarves and cloaks, slipped on rubber sandals and readied themselves today for the mikvah, or ritual bath, in a steamy side building of the Delrakhim synagogue.</p>
        <p>Translated from Persian, the Iranian language, the name of the congregation means generous-hearted. But for the traumatized Jews of Shiraz, 6,000 strong and supporting 16 synagogues, the soft spring evening brought little comfort.</p>
        <p>On Monday, 13 of their number will go on trial in the feared Revolutionary Court, accused of spying for Israel. In the swirl of Iran's internal political battles, the case has drawn  international scrutiny and could undo Iran's tentative overtures to the West.</p>
        <p>''We are all praying for them,'' said Fariba, a woman who, like others, was afraid to give her last name. ''We are a small group, we Jews in Shiraz, and everybody knows them. They are our family.''</p>
        <p>Local Jewish leaders said the arrest of the 13 men is the worst event in anyone's memory to befall the dwindling minority, which has survived in Iran for 2,700 years. The society around them is also in turmoil, and the Jews have been squeezed by the conflict between the hard-line Muslim hierarchy that controls the judiciary and the reformers backing President Mohammad Khatami's efforts at liberalization.</p>
        <p>Jewish groups and human rights organizations have condemned the spy case as a political show trial aimed at frustrating President Khatami's attempts to develop warmer relations with some of the country's traditional enemies, including the United States.</p>
        <p>''The battle between conservatives and reformers is the core of the problem in the case of the Jews,'' said a veteran European diplomat based in Tehran.</p>
        <p>''The case is a pretext for confrontation between the two camps,'' the diplomat added. ''It is one of the means used to embarrass Khatami and no one will go back and say a mistake has been done. And in the middle are these 13 poor people.''</p>
        <p>In the last few months, a succession of foreign envoys have pleaded with Mr. Khatami about the Shiraz Jews, who include a shopkeeper, an office worker, a university professor and a student -- a group that family members say could not have had access to classified information.</p>
        <p>United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, Nelson Mandela and a group of visiting French senators have made personal appeals. President Clinton has expressed concern, and administration officials have said the trial would be a test of Iran's commitment to international standards of human rights.</p>
        <p>But for the Iranian president and most Iranians, the spy case is a sideshow in a larger drama that has intensified in the last two months, since Mr. Khatami's supporters swept aside their conservative opponents in the first round of parliamentary elections.</p>
        <p>Since then, the hard-liners have gone on the offensive, using their dominance in the courts to arrest reformers, close 16 pro-Khatami newspapers and vilify many of his most ardent supporters as foreign agents out to destroy Iran's Islamic system of government.</p>
        <p>Reformers have been kept dangling even about their first-round victory. The deeply conservative Council of Guardians has ordered a third recount of ballots in the capital, Tehran, where reformers won 29 of 30 seats, and has refused so far to certify the results.</p>
        <p>President Khatami, waging a quiet battle to depoliticize the courts and restrain the unchecked power of hard-line militias, has promised the foreign envoys that the Jews will receive a fair trial. Indeed, he has hammered away for three years on one theme -- the need for the rule of law -- and has said all institutions should adhere to the Constitution and popular will.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Khatami has also pointedly refrained from interfering in, or even directly criticizing, the recent judicial persecution of his own political allies. Even as some of his most avid supporters have been sent to prison and their publications have been silenced, he has maintained an image of serene probity.</p>
        <p>It is unlikely, say both diplomats and Khatami associates, that he will undermine that image by interfering openly in the trial of the Shiraz Jews, who if convicted face possible penalties ranging from six months in prison to hanging.</p>
        <p>The theocratic leadership that has ruled Iran since the revolution of 1979 has generally maintained a hands-off attitude toward the Jews.</p>
        <p>But the 30,000 or so remaining Jews here are suspect citizens. Hostility and suspicion toward Israel are dogma here -- and not only for the conservatives or the clerics. Israel is a declared enemy, and Mr. Khatami's reformist supporters, preoccupied with domestic political battles, either do not dare or do not desire to deviate from that line.</p>
        <p>The evidence, if there is any, against the 13 Jews is not known. The lead defense attorney, Esmail Nosari, said the only documentation he has received from the court are transcripts of the interrogations of his clients. Other than their own statements, he said, no proof of their alleged espionage is in their files.</p>
        <p>''Some of the defendants have made statements that they have done something and because of this, the court has accused them of the crime of espionage,'' he said. ''But it's easy to say somebody's a spy. In the public mind, that can have many different meanings. But anyone who has a relationship with a foreigner is  not necessarily a spy. And anyone in any kind of correspondence with a foreign country is not necessarily a spy.''</p>
        <p>The case is before the Revolutionary Court, reserved for political cases and those involving grave crimes like acts against national security and drug trafficking.</p>
        <p>Those are courts where the judges are responsible for upholding the moral values of the Islamic revolution, where they can send a criminal to the gallows or consign a political dissident to years of solitary confinement. Few defense lawyers choose to take clients who run afoul of a Revolutionary Court judge.</p>
        <p>As in other branches of the judiciary, a Revolutionary Court judge acts as investigator, prosecutor and judge in the same case. The system, now five years old, has been widely criticized by lawyers and is seen by human rights groups outside Iran as a glaring invitation to judicial abuse.</p>
        <p>There have been signs that some in the Iranian government may well be trying to appease those critics quietly without directly interceding in the Shiraz espionage trial. A judiciary official in Tehran announced  on Saturday that the government hopes to change the system and strip judges of their prosecutorial role.</p>
        <p>''When you have a situation in criminal cases where one person brings a complaint and that same person is also the judge and the man responsible for enforcing the judgment, it can create the impression that the judge is not impartial,'' said the official, Ghollamreza Shahri, who is head of the legislative affairs department in the judiciary.</p>
        <p>But the Iranian court system is also a battleground between conservatives and reformers. A relative moderate, Mahmoud Hashemi Sharoudi, has headed the judiciary since last summer. His pledges to streamline and depoliticize the courts have already been undermined by judges who have singled out the reform movement for persecution in recent months.</p>
        <p>For the 13 Jews accused of setting up a spy network for Israel, the issue of the structure of the courts is moot.  Sadeq Nourani, the judge in their case, has acted as investigator and will play the dual roles of prosecutor  and judge in their trial.</p>
        <p>The judge has already refused a request from the families and their lawyers for an open trial that could be monitored by independent observers.</p>
        <p>Still, the outside attention has had an effect. The Shiraz court has gone to extraordinary lengths to attempt to answer publicly for its procedures and cultivate an image of openness. Last month, just before Passover, Judge Nourani visited the 10 Jewish defendants who are being held in prison without bail. He wished them a happy holiday, according to a press release issued immediately after the visit by the court system.</p>
        <p>Hussein Ali Amiri, the head of the provincial courts, has met with  American human rights activists, foreign diplomats and journalists in an unusual display of openness for Iran. He said the case has nothing to do with religion or politics, and he maintained that he has gone out of his way to make sure all the defendants have lawyers.</p>
        <p>''I can assure the world it will be a fair trial and the verdict will be  based on law,'' he said. ''It's an ordinary case for us,'' Mr. Amiri added. ''It's people outside who are getting  excited about this.''</p>
        <p>But the lead defense lawyer, Mr. Nosari, said that not all has been  handled as in an ordinary case before the Revolutionary Court. He was hired by the families of three of the accused three weeks ago. He said he has had to get a letter from the judge allowing him to see his clients and has seen them only once.</p>
        <p>A precise man with aviator-style glasses and graying hair, Mr. Nosari is Muslim and himself a former Revolutionary Court judge. Sitting at his spotless desk, his few papers lined up with military precision, he prefaced his conversation with a phrase from the Koran. ''In the name of Allah, the  compassionate, the merciful,'' he murmured before explaining what he could of the espionage case.</p>
        <p>Iranian law, he said, defines a spy as someone who gives or intends to  give classified information or documents to a foreign country or foreign  national. While several of the defendants have visited Israel, an act that is not illegal, they are innocent of espionage, he said.</p>
        <p>If there is a political tug of war over how to handle the Shiraz case, Mr. Nosari added, it has not reached him.</p>
        <p>''I know we have the first group -- the ones who assume they are spies,'' he said. ''But we haven't seen or heard the second group that supposedly wants them released. Nobody has called me, unfortunately, from any side.''</p>
