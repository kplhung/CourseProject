        <p>The power of genetic engineering is providing scientists with the ability to create animals that confound the imagination.</p>
        <p>The most striking of the new creatures being concocted by plucking a gene from one organism and inserting it into the DNA of another are what are known as pharm animals. These domesticated beasts -- cows, pigs, goats, sheep and chickens -- have been given the ability to produce pharmaceuticals and other valuable substances in their milk, eggs or semen.</p>

        <p>The power of genetic engineering is providing scientists with the ability to create animals that confound the imagination.</p>
        <p>The most striking of the new creatures being concocted by plucking a gene from one organism and inserting it into the DNA of another are what are known as pharm animals. These domesticated beasts -- cows, pigs, goats, sheep and chickens -- have been given the ability to produce pharmaceuticals and other valuable substances in their milk, eggs or semen.</p>
        <p>Endowed by scientists with foreign genes, often taken from humans, these animals, or bioreactors, as they are also known, earn their keep as living chemical factories.</p>
        <p>Two companies, the Genzyme Corporation of Cambridge, Mass., and PPL Therapeutics, a Scottish company, already have products from pharm animals being tested in clinical trials supervised by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
        <p>Many other animals are still in the development stage. For example, Nexia Biotechnologies in Canada is working on a goat that carries a gene from spiders allowing it to produce spider silk in its milk. When the spider silk, which consists of extremely strong, light proteins, is extracted from the goat's milk, the substance, potentially, can be used in applications like bulletproof vests.</p>
        <p>Scientific competition is fierce. Some compounds of interest, like the human blood protein erythropoietin, which has not yet been produced by a pharm animal, command prices of more than $15 million an ounce.</p>
        <p>''There is no limit to what can be done,'' said Dr. Francois Pothier, reproductive biologist at the University of Laval in Canada, who is working on a pig that is genetically engineered to produce a drug. Dr. Pothier declined to name the substance. But because research required to create these animals can take years, the drugs they produce, he said, have to be ''very interesting and very expensive.'' Dr. Pothier said his pigs would produce a drug in their  semen, which the pigs could be trained to donate regularly in voluminous quantities.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ann Gibbins, molecular geneticist at the University of Guelph, in Canada, and her team are trying to create chickens that make antibiotics in their eggs.</p>
        <p>Researchers say pharm animals are the only way to produce some of the more complex proteins needed for use as drugs. Some very simple proteins, like insulin, can be churned out by genetically modified bacteria. But some proteins require being folded in particular ways or having sugars added before they can be used. Bacterial cells cannot carry out these advanced tasks but animal cells can, making pharm animals the producers of choice.</p>
        <p>Pharm animals are also of interest because some therapeutic proteins otherwise have to be collected from blood donated by people, which can be tainted by viruses.</p>
        <p>Because they are domesticated and are so valuable, pharm animals are extremely unlikely to escape or pose any environmental threat. But they may still pose risks. Animal tissues and fluids can contain other disease-causing contaminants, like prions, a poorly understood class of molecules associated with maladies including mad cow disease.</p>
        <p>In addition, while animal rights groups have remained relatively quiet on the issue of genetically engineered animals, some say that the use of animals as living factories raises troubling ethical issues.</p>
        <p>There are also food safety issues.</p>
        <p>''Those goats are not going to just get a decent burial after they grow old and stop producing silk,'' said John Matheson, senior regulatory review scientist at the Center for Veterinary Medicine at the Food and Drug Administration, ''so we have to look at them as potential food and as potential feed ingredients.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Matheson said some genetically engineered animals had already been approved for use in animal feeds. He said he was unable to disclose what kinds of animals had been approved for such use or what animals they might be fed to as these genetically engineered animals are still experimental and under confidential review within the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
        <p>But to prevent the spread of prion-associated maladies, Mr. Matheson said, cows would not be given feed made from cows, genetically engineered or not. Noting that animal feed often contains ingredients like  rotting animals killed on highways and parts of slaughtered animals, Mr. Matheson said, ''Transgenics should be the least of your worries, frankly.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 5, 2000, Friday  An article on Monday about genetically modified animals and a chart illustrating them misidentified the company that is engineering a goat to produce a human protein in milk. The company is the Genzyme Transgenics Corporation; formerly a division of the Genzyme Corporation, it is now separate.</p>
