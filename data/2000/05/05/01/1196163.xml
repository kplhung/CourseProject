        <p>With the closing of the Fresh Kills landfill fast approaching, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has sharply revised his long-term plan for disposing the city's household garbage.</p>
        <p>To the surprise and relief of several critics of his old plan, the new plan does not include proposals to build a huge new waste plant in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, and a somewhat smaller plant near Hunts Point in the Bronx. It would also ensure that no borough handled another's garbage, and it would make Linden, N.J., a major hub for transferring garbage into rail containers destined for out-of-state landfills.</p>
        <p>Greg Brooks, chief of staff for the Brooklyn borough president, Howard Golden, called the new plan ''a very good victory for the community.'' Leslie H. Lowe, executive director of the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, called it ''a vast improvement.'' And John McGettrick, a Red Hook civic leader and prominent opponent of the mayor's first garbage plan, described it as ''a positive development.''</p>
        <p>The mayor's plan, which was first reported yesterday by The Daily News, will be presented to the City Council tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Under the new plan, Mr. Brooks said, Red Hook residents would no longer face the prospect of garbage trucks making hundreds of noisy, smelly trips each day through their neighborhood. He added that residents near a garbage plant in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn would no longer have to cope with hundreds of trucks a week rumbling past with garbage from Queens.</p>
        <p>''The borough president is very, very pleased,'' Mr. Brooks said yesterday, adding, ''It's a shame that it took two years for them to come to their senses.''</p>
        <p>City officials are under intense pressure to come up with a long-term garbage plan. The state has set a deadline of December 2001 for the closing of Fresh Kills, the 3,000-acre landfill on Staten Island.</p>
        <p>But with the city continuing to generate 13,000 tons of residential garbage each day, officials have cobbled together an interim system that relies almost entirely on trucks, which are dirty, expensive and hard on the city's streets and bridges.</p>
        <p>Caravans of garbage trucks are making hundreds of thousands of extra trips out of New York City. Along Canal Street, a major route to the Holland Tunnel, air pollution has increased 16 percent, state officials say. And over the next five years, the city expects to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on new garbage trucks, extra trips and additional landfill fees.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, city officials have been searching for better long-term solution.</p>
        <p>At the center of the mayor's first long-term plan was a proposal to build three giant garbage hubs, one in Newark, a second to the south in Carteret, N.J., and a third in Red Hook. The new plan, by contrast, would make greater use the city's existing network of smaller transfer stations. Some transfer stations would be refurbished or expanded. Some would be converted into plants that pack garbage into containers.</p>
        <p>From these smaller stations, much of the city's garbage -- perhaps 6,500 tons a day -- would then be sent by barge to a 20-acre site planned for Linden, where local officials have embraced the garbage business as a way to revitalize the economy. A Houston waste company, BFI, would operate the Linden hub, which is expected to cost $50 million. Kathryn Forsyth, a spokeswoman, said BFI would load garbage into sealed trains and haul it to landfills around the country.</p>
