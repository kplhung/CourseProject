        <p>The New York City Ballet has opened its latest Diamond Project, a showcase of new works, with a splashy and superb ballet that the ever-surprising Christopher Wheeldon has set to Dmitri Shostakovich's First Piano Concerto.</p>
        <p>The title is ''Mercurial Manoeuvres,'' with the British spelling deliberately used by Mr. Wheeldon, who is, in fact, a British soloist in the company. Whatever you call it, it is a work that makes the 28-year-old Mr. Wheeldon a star in the choreographic firmament. No ballet choreographer of his generation can match his imaginative use of the classical vocabulary.</p>
        <p>For a viewer the hallmark of a fine ballet is the desire to see it again, and here there is even a need to see it again, to grasp more completely a complexity that is nonetheless easy on the eye.</p>
        <p>In ''Mercurial Manoeuvres,'' which had its premiere on Friday night at the New York State Theater, the surface gleams with formal structures and patterns. Yet within the City Ballet's tradition of Neo-Classical plotless ballets, this is one with a robust difference: images abound, and there is a fierce sense of design on all levels.</p>
        <p>As the 21 dancers fly through the choreography's rapidly shifting diagonals, with nary a circle in sight, the geometric forms of painters like Kandinsky and Malevich come to mind. Shostakovich belonged to the Soviet generation that succeeded this Russian avant-garde, and what Mr. Wheeldon has heard in this early (1933) concerto for piano, trumpet and orchestra is wit and creativity.</p>
        <p>There is no contradiction in the idea that the women, in Carole Divet's smartly designed blue tunics, resemble cigarette girls in a nightclub or that a male quartet, with red buttons, suggests bellhops more than troops on maneuvers. There is humor in the trumpet solos, played by Raymond Mase, and there is merriment within Mr. Wheeldon's rigorous abstractions. Cameron Grant plays the piano solos with Maurice Kaplow conducting.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Wheeldon does avoid is the regimentation that colored the corps in another Shostakovich work: Kenneth MacMillan's ''Concerto,'' a ballet that was once a staple of American Ballet Theater and the Royal Ballet, Mr. Wheeldon's alma mater. MacMillan used Shostakovich's Second Piano Concerto and translated the piano's percussive sound into drill-like formations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wheeldon's sly reference to maneuvers in his title might partly refer to the tricky partnering that Miranda Weese and Jock Soto absorb so beautifully into the ballet's inventive central duet. But there is also a military conceit evoked by the piano's sharpness. In a carefully plotted design for the corps and the first principal, Edward Liang, Mr. Wheeldon puts his troops on parade but without the mechanical quality that crept into the MacMillan ensembles.</p>
        <p>In his impressive progress as a choreographer in the last five years, Mr. Wheeldon has not shied away from the romantic or sentimental image. To those who feared he would turn mushy, he now offers a hard-edge reply.</p>
        <p>Yet one of the interests of his new ballet is the way he changes the meaning of formal movement. The corps and Mr. Liang, who dominates the first lively movement, strike up a choreographic motif by raising one arm in diagonal. But when Ms. Weese does the same at the end of the pas de deux when Mr. Soto leaves, her gesture becomes an expression of parting, at one with the yearning expressiveness of the concerto's second, slow movement.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the third section is played and danced at an astonishingly accelerated pace. Mr. Wheeldon's gift for changing directions and ensemble patterns in the air as well as on the ground gives the company a workout, to say the least.</p>
        <p>Design is paramount. Mr. Liang, in red, begins the ballet behind a series of black gauze panels that Mark Stanley's stunning lighting design turns red. Mr. Stanley then suddenly reveals 12 women, who materialize without warning.</p>
        <p>Mr. Liang, in fine form, is identified mainly with the piano, but his first solo is danced to a trumpet solo. As the women shoot off in trios and quartets, human helicopters with arms flashing in the air, Mr. Liang is joined by two new women, Elena Diner and Aubrey Morgan, who are lifted by the male quartet.</p>
        <p>Only Mr. Soto, in red tights, and Ms. Weese, in gray tunic with red trim, have not been seen in the first movement. As they begin the second section, she is surrounded by the male quartet and he is inside a square of four women. Left alone, they dance with outstanding clarity and polish in a duet that is emotional (lifts and embraces arrested in a leap). Yet every swoon and contour, with a V-shape prevalent, has a geometric tinge.</p>
        <p>The third movement has a welcome swagger. The different units mesh as Mr. Liang and Mr. Soto, with marathon swiftness, come to the fore. The women salute Ms. Weese, the rhythm shifts, and the finale comes to a fast and furious finish. Well done on all accounts.</p>
        <p>Just as impressive was the dancing on the program's other two ballets. Margaret Tracey has recovered the energy and precision needed for the ballerina role in George Balanchine's ''Square Dance,'' in which Peter Boal makes amazing sense of a male solo filled with non sequiturs. Jerome Robbins's ''West Side Story Suite'' is again a total treat, led with exuberant conviction by Robert La Fosse, Helene Alexopoulos and Nikolaj Hubbe. Paul Gemignani was the guest conductor, and Rob Lorey, Joan Barber, Stephanie Bast, Joy Hermalyn and Karen Murphy were the singers.</p>
