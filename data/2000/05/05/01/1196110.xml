        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article about two men of different backgrounds who formed a partnership over their desire to work with schoolchildren is truly inspiring (''2 Men's Meeting of Mind and Spirit, in the 5th Grade,'' Education page, April 26).</p>
        <p>These two remarkable men provide firm discipline; caring and down-to-earth role models; and a belief in the intrinsic worth of these children and the value of teaching them.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article about two men of different backgrounds who formed a partnership over their desire to work with schoolchildren is truly inspiring (''2 Men's Meeting of Mind and Spirit, in the 5th Grade,'' Education page, April 26).</p>
        <p>These two remarkable men provide firm discipline; caring and down-to-earth role models; and a belief in the intrinsic worth of these children and the value of teaching them.</p>
        <p>What the children gain is a justifiable pride in accomplishment, pride in the group and pride in themselves. These are the greatest gifts with which a child can be endowed. Why is this model so rarely replicated in today's schools?</p>
