        <p>Brushing aside the angry objections of China, Christie's auctioned two relics today that the Chinese government said had been looted from an imperial palace 140 years ago.</p>
        <p>The pieces, bronze sculptures of an ox head and a monkey head, each sold for slightly more than $1 million, far above the estimate of $500,000 to $580,000 in the Christie's catalog.</p>
        <p>Christie's said the pieces were bought by the same person, whom it declined to identify. Local television reports said the buyer was a collector from mainland China. Executives in the art market here said they hoped that that would soften the reaction of the Chinese government.</p>
        <p>On Friday, China's Cultural Relics Bureau said it would be ''insulting and deeply painful to the Chinese people to have these things sold before their eyes.'' Officials at the bureau said the relics were stolen from the Old Summer Palace in Beijing when it was ransacked in 1860 by British and French troops.</p>
        <p>The Chinese government had no immediate response to the sale.</p>
        <p>The looting of the palace is an charged event in Chinese history. Passions erupted today in the lobby of the hotel where the auction was held. As a well-dressed crowd waited to enter the auction, a dozen demonstrators shouted nationalistic slogans and scuffled with guards.</p>
        <p>One protester broke through a security barrier, shouting through a bullhorn, ''Return our national treasures immediately.'' The guards were forced to pull down a metal curtain to fend off the group.</p>
        <p>Demonstrators also marched to Sotheby's offices here; that house plans to auction two more palace relics on Tuesday. They demanded that Sotheby's withdraw the pieces, a hexagonal vase and a bronze tiger's head. But the company said it still intended to put them on the block.</p>
        <p>''I'm relieved by the Christie's sale because it indicates our pieces could do quite well also,'' said Carlton Rochell, the managing director of the China and Southeast Asia division at Sotheby's. He added, ''Because of whom they sold to, it might defuse the whole situation a bit.''</p>
        <p>China's unexpected objection to the auction had thrown Hong Kong's art world into a tizzy. As a former British colony with an affluent Chinese population, Hong Kong has long been a rich market for antiquities from China. But the government has served notice that it will no longer look the other way while its treasures are sold off in a city that now belongs to China.</p>
        <p>Legal experts said the Chinese government has no legal authority to halt the auctions. Hong Kong is a separate jurisdiction where China's laws protecting the sale of national treasures do not apply. The Hong Kong government said today that it would not interfere with the sales.</p>
        <p>But China's anger has raised a thorny political issue for Christie's and Sotheby's, which hold auctions of Chinese antiquities here and elsewhere several times a year. In late March, United States Customs officials seized a 10th-century marble sculpture that was to be sold at Christie's gallery in New York. In that case, China said it had proof that the sculpture, a painted relief panel, had been stolen.</p>
