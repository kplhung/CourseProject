        <p>The online music service MP3.com expressed guarded confidence about reaching a settlement with the Recording Industry Association of America, following a federal court ruling on Friday that MP3.com had violated copyright law by creating an online database of 80,000 major-label recordings.</p>
        <p>''We are cautiously optimistic of a business resolution,'' Michael Robertson, the chief executive of MP3.com, said in an e-mail message responding to questions. The recording industry association and major music conglomerates have asked for up to $6 billion in damages, almost half of the more than $14 billion retail value of recordings sold in the United States in 1999.</p>

        <p>The online music service MP3.com expressed guarded confidence about reaching a settlement with the Recording Industry Association of America, following a federal court ruling on Friday that MP3.com had violated copyright law by creating an online database of 80,000 major-label recordings.</p>
        <p>''We are cautiously optimistic of a business resolution,'' Michael Robertson, the chief executive of MP3.com, said in an e-mail message responding to questions. The recording industry association and major music conglomerates have asked for up to $6 billion in damages, almost half of the more than $14 billion retail value of recordings sold in the United States in 1999.</p>
        <p>Paul Vidich, an executive vice president for Time Warner's Warner Music Group who has been negotiating with MP3.com's lawyers, said his company was not trying to shut down MP3.com's music storage service, which is called My.MP3.com.</p>
        <p>''The purpose of the settlement discussion is to establish the legitimate basis on which the service can continue,'' he said. ''I don't think anyone in the recording industry is looking to stop new business models that take advantage of the uniqueness of the Internet.''</p>
        <p>Recording companies praised the decision as an affirmation of copyright protection. ''A validation of the legal standing of a copyright is very good news for anybody who's directly involved with artists,'' said Danny Goldberg, chief executive of Artemis Records, an independent label that releases CD's and runs Internet radio and music subscription services.</p>
        <p>The ruling does not affect the widespread use of MP3 (a compression technology that is not owned by MP3.com) to make copies of music available across the Internet. The popularity of MP3 has alarmed the recording business because it allows listeners to copy and distribute music from any compact disc. Still, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, CD shipments in the United States rose by 10 percent in 1999, even as MP3 use exploded and many companies offered full-length songs as free samples.</p>
        <p>''It seems counterintuitive, but an increase in free downloads coincided with an increase in paid sales,'' Mr. Goldberg said. ''Particularly among the young audience, the people who are most wired, the evidence is that it's bonding a new generation to music.''</p>
        <p>The ruling also does not address the issues in the suit the recording industry association has brought against Napster, an online music service whose software allows listeners to freely swap songs in the MP3 format over the Internet, since Napster does not retain any copies of songs.</p>
        <p>My.MP3.com is a small part of MP3.com, most of which is devoted to offering free music from thousands of performers. ''Almost none of our revenues are attributable to My.MP3.com currently,'' Mr. Robertson said.</p>
        <p>My.MP3.com is an online storage system for music in the MP3 format, allowing listeners access to the music in their own CD collections over the Internet. Other music storage services, like myplay.com, require listeners to convert songs from their CD's into MP3 files, a time-consuming process. My.MP3.com recognizes a compact disc in a listener's computer, and if the recording is in MP3.com's database, it can be added instantly to an individual's online collection, which is protected by a password.</p>
        <p>MP3.com purchased 80,000 major-label CD's for its database in order, it argued, to provide consumers with easier access to music they had already bought. The recording industry's suit successfully contended that My.MP3.com was using copyrighted recordings without paying licensing fees.</p>
        <p>''The mere existence of technology  that allows for an easy subversion of copyright protection doesn't make it correct,'' said Al Teller, chief executive of Atomic Pop, an independent label that sells CD's and MP3 downloads. ''If you're building a commercial enterprise by virtue of performing this service, then you have an obligation to get the rights from the owners of the copyright.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Robertson said that the ruling would only affect those CD's released by the companies in the suit.  ''The My.MP3.com infrastructure will continue to be in place,'' he said. ''There are tens of thousands of CD's in the system which labels and artists have requested we put into the system.'' The service has 400,000 registered users.</p>
        <p>Jim Griffin, chief executive of Cherry Lane Digital, a consulting firm for digitally distributed arts companies, said the current case is part of a broader conflict. ''Music is the canary in the coal mine for all digital entertainment,'' he said. . ''This is a minor skirmish in the war between record companies and their so-called pirates.''</p>
        <p>The dot.com companies thrive on an image of constructive rebellion, he suggested, so the lawsuit could add to MP3.com's prominence.</p>
        <p>''In a way, MP3.com's biggest risk is of obscurity,'' he said. ''Any damages borne by MP3.com must be weighed against the value of distinguishing the company as the prime mover for digital music and change.''</p>
