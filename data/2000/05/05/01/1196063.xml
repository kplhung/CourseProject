        <p>Armed with a formal but vague go-ahead from one of its advisory panels, the Internet's international oversight body has begun writing a plan for new suffixes that would be added to ones like .com, .net and .org used in network addresses.</p>
        <p>The work follows a recent report from one of the group's committees recommending that the Internet addressing system be expanded.</p>
        <p>The report proposed that the group, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, consider creating four different types of address suffixes, known as domains. The four new domains would include those that are open to anyone, others that are for specialized businesses, some for noncommercial interests and others for personal use.</p>
        <p>But the report on April 20 avoided many tough questions, leaving it to Icann's staff to make recommendations to the board on what the new domains should be called, how many should be added and when. The report also gave no guidance on how to protect trademark holders from a new round of speculative buying of their famous words by so-called cybersquatters, although that issue is still being studied by Icann members. One industry proposal would give trademark holders an opportunity to register their names before those words were opened to the public for registration.</p>
        <p>Icann's president, Michael M. Roberts, said the staff would try to answer the implementation questions in a report he hoped to release for public comment within a month. A final decision by Icann on how to proceed is expected at the board's next public meeting in Yokohama, Japan, in July. It is unclear whether that decision will include a go-ahead for introducing new domains.</p>
        <p>Seizing on the lack of consensus or guidance from the business and noncommercial interest groups that were involved in writing the report, Network Solutions -- the company that operates the worldwide registry for .com, .net and .org -- has proposed that only two domains be added initially, .shop and .banc.</p>
        <p>Network Solutions has also proposed that the new registries be run by industry organizations rather than by individual companies. Network Solutions was the sole registrar of addresses for the .com, .net and .org domains, until the Clinton Administration set up Icann in 1998 to break up that monopoly.</p>
        <p>Network Solutions still controls a large part of the registration business. Last week, the company reported that it had registered two million new domains in the first quarter of 2000, more than one-third of the total number of domain names registered.</p>
