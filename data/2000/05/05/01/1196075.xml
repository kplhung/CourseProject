        <p>So troubled was the 19th century by the incompleteness of Bach's six Partitas and Sonatas that a number of composers took the job of filling in what Bach's solo violin  left out, usually by adding a piano part. Chords were fully realized. Contrapuntal lines that in the original were disconnected dashes and strokes were spelled out from first note to last. Here at last, the thinking went, was everything Bach had meant to tell us.</p>
        <p>Our zeal for improvement has subsided, I am happy to report. For omission is precisely the act that makes these pieces so powerful. More can make things bigger; but as Christian Tetzlaff's performances on Saturday afternoon and evening made so eloquently clear, doing less exercises the imagination in more profound ways.

        <p>So troubled was the 19th century by the incompleteness of Bach's six Partitas and Sonatas that a number of composers took the job of filling in what Bach's solo violin  left out, usually by adding a piano part. Chords were fully realized. Contrapuntal lines that in the original were disconnected dashes and strokes were spelled out from first note to last. Here at last, the thinking went, was everything Bach had meant to tell us.</p>
        <p>Our zeal for improvement has subsided, I am happy to report. For omission is precisely the act that makes these pieces so powerful. More can make things bigger; but as Christian Tetzlaff's performances on Saturday afternoon and evening made so eloquently clear, doing less exercises the imagination in more profound ways. The young German violinist is a master of this literature, and his playing enchanted the large audiences at back-to-back recitals in Alice Tully Hall.</p>
        <p>We all know and love violinists for whom the instrument is everything. We also love the people who write for them: composers who are seduced equally by the violin's tone, penetration and virtuoso possibilities. Saturday's player and composer were altogether different people from these. Mr. Tetzlaff's sound was big enough to be clear and present in an 1,100-seat hall, but I doubt it is much bigger. His technical fluency solved very nearly every problem the music presented it, although I remember the same violinist in New York a few years ago being rather cruelly treated by the Sibelius Concerto, a ''bigger'' and more forbidding piece to play.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tetzlaff's success here was simply that everything he did had a purpose; there was no excess and no deficit, only what the music needed. Even the lighting had a reason. Placing himself under a spotlight on a darkened stage was less theatrics than a way of narrowing the eye to a single isolated space. Eyes watching musical performance have a way of persuading the ear, and this performer knows it.</p>
        <p>Politics of style had little place here. The violin and bow, and the forward sound they are intended to make, were all completely up-to-date. Mr. Tetzlaff had no hesitation in stretching out or accelerating phrases. Some of the tone was straightened; some luxuriated in heavy vibrato, so better to distinguish one musical line from another. The modern violin does a better job both of thundering and whispering than its Baroque ancestor, and Mr. Tetzlaff thundered and whispered without shame.</p>
        <p>Again there was purpose in every gesture. Limited by one bow against four strings, Bach's deft little interjections plant the idea of second and third voices that the instrument is in literal terms unable to play. Indeed, the empty spaces make the music bigger by leaving out much of it. Mr. Tetzlaff playing the famous Chaconne at the evening concert (it is the conclusion of the D-minor Partita) created a world wider than anything a Mahler or a Bruckner could orchestrate. I have heard this piece many times but never projected with such cumulative power. The melodic elements survive from one of the Partita's movements to the next, and this performance identified every connection.</p>
        <p>The three Sonatas and three Partitas belong to a period (probably about 1720). They derive from a tradition of solo violin music by earlier composers. They celebrate the Baroque's preocculation with dance forms as well as learned contrapuntal style. But in the hands of players like Mr. Tetzlaff, period, style and ancestry are minor issues. Universal is not a word one likes to throw around, but this music is neither old or new. It simply is.</p>
