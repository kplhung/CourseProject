        <p>The Yankees' two-inning seven-run flurry against Toronto yesterday could be considered impressive, but they were batting against Roy Halladay, and as Bart Giamatti used to say, ''You could use a higher standard.''</p>
        <p>The Blue Jays' young right-hander entered the game at Yankee Stadium with a 10.80 earned run average and a .370 batting average against him. The E.R.A. was the highest among American League starting pitchers; the opponents' batting average was second highest, only 6 points below the .376 owned by Sean Bergman of Minnesota.</p>
        <p>That Halladay was able to lower, though not by much, both of those gaudy figures indicated that the Yankees are still not blasting anyone out of the ballpark.</p>
        <p>''To win 15 games the way we did, we feel fortunate,'' Manager Joe Torre said, discussing April in the Bronx. The team finished the first month of the season with the second-best record in the American League. ''You'd have to look at the paper to convince me.''</p>
        <p>Torre was not complaining, not being critical of his team. With the starting pitchers collectively not pitching to their presumed capabilities and the hitters producing the second-fewest runs in the league, he is tremendously gratified every day when he looks at the standings and sees the Yankees in the spot to which he and they have become accustomed.</p>
        <p>The only team with a better won-loss record is the upstart Chicago White Sox, who lead the Central Division on the strength of a league-leading 181 runs. The Yankees, by contrast, have scored 112, nearly two and a half fewer a game.</p>
        <p>''We're not going to compete with teams that score a lot of runs,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>Before the Yankees erupted for seven runs in the fifth and sixth innings and won, 7-1, they missed opportunities to score runs.</p>
        <p>Immediately after Tino Martinez, with one out in the second inning, lashed his third triple of the season, Ricky Ledee took a third strike, failing to hit the ball somewhere so that Martinez might score. In the same situation in the next inning, with Scott Brosius at third and one out, Derek Jeter bounced the first pitch back to the mound for an easy out.</p>
        <p>Before Paul O'Neill doubled with the bases loaded in the fifth, driving in the first three runs, Chuck Knoblauch and Jeter struck out, Jeter taking his third strike.</p>
        <p>''We had our one, two, three guys up with the bases loaded,'' Torre said, ''and it took the No. 3 guy to drive in the runs.''</p>
        <p>Torre suggested that the plate umpire, Paul Emmel, had a wide strike zone, which umpires are not supposed to have, but Yankees catcher Jorge Posada observed that Emmel was calling the same strike zone for both teams.</p>
        <p>Jeter said he could not have hit the third strike to him if he had tried, but he admitted he wished he had taken the first pitch from Halladay in his previous at-bat.</p>
        <p>''He threw a sinker that moved in a lot,'' Jeter said. ''Ideally you don't want to swing at it, but that's why he's effective. He throws a ball that looks like it's going to be a strike and then it moves inside. He did exactly what he wanted to do in that situation. If I had to do it over, I wouldn't do it.''</p>
        <p>But the Yankees won the game, and that, Jeter said, is what counts.</p>
        <p>''If you go back over the records and check out the last few years,'' the shortstop said, ''we've had similar streaks where we didn't score a lot of runs. Maybe it just didn't occur at the beginning of the season. I really don't think it looks bad. We're in first place. We've been able to win some games. We're just not scoring as much as we'd like. You find ways to win; that's the bottom line. That's what we've been doing the last few years.''</p>
        <p>This year, the Yankees are doing it with Ledee and Shane Spencer in the lineup. Their presence has created probably the biggest questions about the 2000 version of the Yankees. Before the game, the total of their two batting averages, .394, did not match the top two individual averages in the league --.442 for Darin Erstad, .405 for John Olerud. Jermaine Dye was hitting exactly .394.</p>
        <p>Ledee emerged from the game without a hit in four at-bats, his average skidding to .173. Spencer, however, cracked a single and a two-run home run, raising his average to .222.</p>
        <p>''I am still not where I want to be,'' Spencer said. ''It's like this every year for me. I get off to slow starts. I'm working on little things. I think they know that. I usually need 150 at-bats to start to click. Hopefully they stick with me that long.''</p>
        <p>Torre apparently has every intention of sticking with Spencer and Ledee. ''The fact that you win enhances the patience level,'' the manager said. ''If you're struggling and not winning, you're always going to throw the magnifying glass on those things and you may have to do something to perk things up. But as long as we're winning, I can be patient, at least for a while. Right now we're trying to find out who the D.H. is and how we're going to play the rest of the season. I think you have to invest the first couple of months to find that out.''</p>
        <p>Can he afford to do that? ''I think we have to do that,'' Torre said. ''That's the commitment we made.''</p>
