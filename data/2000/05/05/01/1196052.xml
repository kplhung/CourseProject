        <p>To some careful readers, the photographs in an article in the May 2000 issue of Talk magazine looked awfully familiar.</p>
        <p>The Talk article, ''Perfectly Pointless Days,'' by Charles Gandee, describes in loving detail the Fire Island vacation compound of Sam Green, an art dealer and friend to the famous. The images, photographed by Scott Frances, show various idyllic vacation house scenes. There is a dining room suffused with beach light, rustic bentwood chairs beneath a tree, a piano that John Lennon took to the house one summer, a charming bedroom and a poetic shot of a screen door.</p>
        <p>There is a reason the photographs looked familiar. In April 1993, an American edition of the Conde Nast publication Maison et Jardin, featured the article ''Play It Again, Sam,'' which described in loving detail the same Fire Island vacation compound.</p>
        <p>The package was produced by Mr. Gandee when he was creative director of House &amp; Garden, Maison et Jardin's sister publication. All of the pictures in the Talk piece come from that photograph session, which actually occurred in 1992. Five of the pictures in Talk, including the two largest photographs in the package, appeared with the Maison et Jardin article.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gandee, who resigned from Conde Nast's Vogue magazine to be the features editor at Talk in January, said that he saw no reason not to use the photographs at his new employer, a magazine whose stated mission was to break news and bring innovative, fresh features to its readers.</p>
        <p>In a faxed statement, Mr. Gandee said: ''As we were assembling the May issue, we felt that an idyllic summer place -- high on charm, rich in history -- would add a welcome escapist element to the editorial mix. Green's compound came to mind.''</p>
        <p>He added that he used the previously published work because when the May issue was being assembled, it was winter and the trees on Fire Island were leafless.</p>
        <p>Robert B. Wallace, Talk's editorial director, said that the decision to run the photographs fell under his purview. Though the magazine was published in the United States with text in English, Mr. Wallace said he still considered it a foreign publication and also said that he believed it had only a limited circulation.</p>
        <p>''Those factors made it negligible enough not to be a real issue,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gandee said that the magazine's editors did not feel compelled to inform readers that the photographs were seven years old and had been published together already accompanying an article about the same subject.</p>
        <p>''If you went to the newsstand and picked up every magazine that featured previously published photographs without telling readers, it would be a substantial number,'' he said.</p>
