        <p>The music that accompanied Lennox Lewis into the Madison Square Garden ring before Saturday night's heavyweight title fight was from the movie ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.''</p>
        <p>It was a foreboding overture for what was to follow.</p>
        <p>The good was Lewis's efficient, if brutish, dismantling of the challenger Michael Grant. The second-round knockout proved Lewis was a more skilled counterpuncher than he was allowed to show in either of the mauling fights with Evander Holyfield.</p>
        <p>The bad was Grant, the baby bull. The crudity of his ring skills was exceeded only by the inanity of his head-down, charging strategy.</p>
        <p>The ugly is what's left for the heavyweight division in the next several months. Grant might not have been ready for the grand stage of a pay-per-view title fight, but he was still the most intriguing contender for the championship.</p>
        <p>Intrigue will be missing for most of the rest of the year when Lewis steps into the ring.</p>
        <p>Indeed, unless the division produces a rising, dynamic young star -- someone with more polish and boxing pedigree than the 27-year-old Grant -- the orderly, proficient Lewis could remain the dominant heavyweight personality for several more years, systematically banging his big right hand through the good, bad and ugly of what's left of the division.</p>
        <p>At some point, there is always the possibility of a Mike Tyson-to-the-rescue moment. That is if Tyson can be revived and retooled. A continuation of the nearly 10-year disintegration of Tyson's once meteoric career is the prospect most in the fight game expect instead.</p>
        <p>Lewis, with his own interests in mind, is rooting for Tyson to put together something promising.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure the whole world would like to see that matchup,'' Lewis said of a fight with Tyson, who is scheduled to fight Lou Savarese on June 24. ''I'd like to fight him. My fans would like me to fight him. But what can I do?</p>
        <p>''I'm the man at the top. He knows where to find me.''</p>
        <p>For now Lewis will take the easy road, which is understandable. Lewis, who is 34, has been busy trying to get the world to recognize him as the universally accepted heavyweight champion for six years, fighting 12 times since he lost his World Boxing Council title to Oliver McCall on Sept. 24, 1994.</p>
        <p>He has not fought at home in England, where he is most popular, since that McCall defeat. So on July 15 he plans to fight in London against Francois Botha, the South African who will enter the ring a huge underdog. A fight against David Tua, the International Boxing Federation's top-ranked contender, should follow later in the year.</p>
        <p>Lewis, who is usually forthright and modest, said of Tua on Saturday: ''I've seen him fight. He's not of my caliber.''</p>
        <p>Lewis did relinquish his World Boxing Association title when he fought Grant, though he retained the W.B.C. and I.B.F. titles. And he is still the undisputed champion in the eyes of the boxing public and most everyone else associated with the sport.</p>
        <p>Though Holyfield and John Ruiz will fight on June 10 for the W.B.A. title, Lewis did not seem eager to take on the winner to unify the title officially.</p>
        <p>''Whoever picks up that belt is a paper champion,'' Lewis said.</p>
        <p>As for Grant, time will tell if he learned from his first defeat and whether he has the skills to mature from it. Late Saturday night Grant was gracious but perhaps still a bit foggy from the three knockdowns and one standing eight count he wobbled through with Lewis in pursuit.</p>
        <p>''Lennox is champion for a reason,'' Grant said. ''He dropped his hands at the start of the fight and said, 'Come on.' I took the wrong mentality from there. I was trying to take his head off. He played the part right and knocked me around pretty good from there.''</p>
        <p>Grant, who picked himself up from the ring floor for the second time just as the first round was ending, was asked what his corner told him between rounds.</p>
        <p>Grant paused, appearing confused as he searched fruitlessly for an answer. Finally he turned to his trainer, Don Turner, and asked, ''What'd you say to me?''</p>
        <p>Turner put a hand on his fighter's back.</p>
        <p>''You're going to be O.K.,'' Turner answered.</p>
        <p>It was not clear whether Turner was repeating his advice during the fight, offering postdefeat assurance, or both.</p>
        <p>PUNCH LINES</p>
        <p>HBO will televise the LENNOX LEWIS-MICHAEL GRANT fight Friday at 10 p.m. . . . Besides Lewis, the biggest winner of Saturday night's event was PAUL INGLE, the English International Boxing Federation featherweight champion, who came back from a ninth-round knockdown to knock out JUNIOR JONES in the 11th. Ingle was leading the fight on two of the three judges' cards. Jones, the former bantamweight and junior-featherweight champion, took a beating and was bleeding from his mouth, his cheek and above his eye. Jones, 29, has lost three of his last six fights after winning 44 of the previous 46 fights. His handlers plan to ask him to consider retirement.</p>
