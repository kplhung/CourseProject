        <p>Commissioner David Stern attended the first National Basketball Association playoff game on Canadian soil today and, no, he was not disappointed to see Vince Carter eliminated and Latrell Sprewell move on.</p>
        <p>The league and NBC have often been accused of promoting the league's telegenic young stars -- especially Carter -- at the expense of aging veterans who produce lower television ratings.</p>
        <p>Stern has referred to the accusations as ''pure media fiction.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, before Game 3, he also rebutted the opinion that Sprewell was a player the league would not go out of its way to promote after he challenged Stern's one-year suspension of him and the termination of his contract by the Golden State Warriors for choking P. J. Carlesimo in 1997.</p>
        <p>''I said to the arbitrator -- when my ruling was challenged and they asked about the future of Latrell -- I said what we believe in is, when you do something wrong you get punished for it,'' Stern said. ''You suffer that punishment and then you come back in good graces as a member of a family and we do everything we can to promote you and move you forward.</p>
        <p>''That just proves we are people of our word. If Latrell Sprewell is a good citizen, then he is going to be promoted just as the other players are. There is no sort of special list of players we shouldn't promote.''</p>
        <p>Stern added, ''I haven't been following him that closely, but by the interviews I've seen and his demeanor, he has been terrific.''</p>
        <p>If recent injuries to Grant Hill, Tim Hardaway and Jason Kidd hurt their opportunities to play in the Olympics next September, Sprewell would be considered a candidate for the United States team.</p>
        <p>But he would have to leapfrog an impressive list of players who almost made the team, including Eddie Jones, Kobe Bryant and Chris Webber.</p>
