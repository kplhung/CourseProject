        <p>Ship to Shore</p>
        <p>Vikings are getting their due in a $3 million, 5,500-square-foot exhibition that has just opened at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington. Creating the show involved nine countries, 15 curators, specialists from around the world and an act of the Icelandic Parliament authorizing a loan of ancient manuscripts. The exhibition, ''Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga,'' which continues through Aug. 13, consists of more than 300 objects spanning more than 1,000 years. It commemorates the 1,000-year anniversary of the arrival of Vikings in North America and examines recent archaeological discoveries that have changed the picture of early life in North America and Scandinavia. Information: (202) 357-2700.</p>

        <p>Ship to Shore</p>
        <p>Vikings are getting their due in a $3 million, 5,500-square-foot exhibition that has just opened at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington. Creating the show involved nine countries, 15 curators, specialists from around the world and an act of the Icelandic Parliament authorizing a loan of ancient manuscripts.

        <p>Seasonal Sign</p>
        <p>Summer is definitely on the way. For evidence look toward Boston, where the 115th season of Boston Pops concerts begins at 8 p.m. tomorrow in Symphony Hall. Keith Lockhart, conducting the first of his 38 concerts in a 62-concert schedule that runs through July 9, will be joined by the Boston Pops Esplanade Orchestra and its guest vocalist, Ben Vereen. The opening works, ''Fanfare for the Common Man'' and ''Appalachian Spring,'' usher in a seasonlong centennial salute to Aaron Copland. Highlights of the season include tributes to the Great American Songbook; nights devoted to big-band favorites, Broadway hits and Latin and Celtic repertory; and, of course, the Fourth of July program. Information: (888) 266-1492 or (617) 266-1492.</p>
        <p>In Tune</p>
        <p>They're singing Jake Heggie's songs everywhere this week. Well, almost. To begin with, a program of songs by Mr. Heggie, the composer in residence of the San Francisco Opera, is to be presented at Alice Tully Hall at 8 tonight by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. The event, titled ''The Faces of Love,'' includes not only New York premieres but also a sneak preview from Mr. Heggie's opera ''Dead Man Walking,'' with narration by its librettist, Terrence McNally. Information: (212) 875-5788. Then, at the auditorium of the Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street in Manhattan, at 8 p.m. on Thursday and Friday, the Eos Orchestra is to present the world premiere of Mr. Heggie's short opera, ''Again,'' in a program titled ''Six 10-Minute Operas II.'' Information: (212) 691-6415.</p>
        <p>Party Time</p>
        <p>Except when religious holidays interrupted, Carnival in 18th-century Venice ran practically nonstop from late October until after Easter. Musically, at least, Carnival's spirit will be revisited when the Little Orchestra Society opens the 10th anniversary season of its Vivaldi's Venice series with ''Carnival in Venice'' at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at Alice Tully Hall. Led by Dino Anagnost, the ensemble will perform music written by Vivaldi for Carnival, as well as works by Handel and Domenico Scarlatti, both of whom attended the annual festival. Information: (212) 971-9500.</p>
