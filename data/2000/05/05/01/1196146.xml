        <p>The Compaq Computer Corporation named FCB Worldwide in New York, part of True North Communications, to handle its worldwide advertising account. Billings were estimated at $300 million. The account had been handled by DDB Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group.</p>
        <p>The decision came after a three-month review that had been narrowed to FCB, DDB and one other agency in New York, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.</p>

        <p>Assignments for direct marketing and promotions, primarily in the United States, remain at the New York office of Draft Worldwide, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
        <p>Compaq consolidated its advertising at DDB in June 1998 after acquiring a DDB client, the Digital Equipment Corporation. That was unexpected because, until then, Compaq's advertising had been handled by Ammirati Puris Lintas in New York, now part of the Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners unit of the Lowe Group, owned by Interpublic. There have been several changes in top management at Compaq since DDB's selection.</p>
