        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Charles Fried, a solicitor general in the Reagan Administration (Op-Ed, April 27), condemns the 1994 Violence Against Women Act, a law that passed with bipartisan support in Congress and the support of more than 41 state attorneys general.</p>
        <p>In dismissing the act, Mr. Fried does not mention that Congress held four years of evidentiary hearings demonstrating the severe economic costs of violence to women, employers and society. Congress concluded that ''a federal civil rights action . . . is necessary to reduce the substantial adverse effects of interstate commerce caused by crimes of violence motivated by gender.''</p>

Congress concluded that ''a federal civil rights action . . . is necessary to reduce the substantial adverse effects of interstate commerce caused by crimes of violence motivated by gender.''</p>
        <p>According to the Bureau of National Affairs, domestic violence costs employers as much as $5 billion annually because of absenteeism and lost productivity. Society also bears the costs of medical and social services of victims and their families.</p>
        <p>The civil rights remedy recognizes women's civil right to be free from gender-motivated violence and gives teeth to the law.</p>
