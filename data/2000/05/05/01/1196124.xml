        <p>Iran to Start Trial Of Jews Accused of Spying  Thirteen Jews will go on trial today in Iran in the feared Revolutionary Court. The Jews are accused of spying for Israel, in a case that has been caught up in the swirl of Iran's internal political battles and could undo its tentative overtures to the West. But for most Iranians the case is a sideshow in a larger drama that has intensified between reformers and hard-liners.</p>

        <p>Nuclear Arms Control Debate  American proposals to change a key arms control agreement have revived some of the more important, if arcane, debates over nuclear strategy that not long ago seemed consigned to the dustbin of the cold war. One is widely viewed as raising the risk of accidental nuclear war.</p>

        <p>Israel Move to Transfer Land  Tensions between Jewish settlers and the Israeli government intensified as Prime Minister Ehud Barak prepared to seek cabinet approval for the transfer of three Arab villages near Jerusalem to the Palestinian Authority. Tensions between Mr. Barak's government and the Palestinians also escalated over the settlement issue.</p>
        <p>A13</p>
        <p>Lawmaker Favors Iraq Embargo  Representative Tony P. Hall, an Ohio Democrat and the first American member of Congress to go to Iraq to assess the impact of economic sanctions on the population, has concluded that while some of the suffering he saw was ''heartbreaking,'' he could not support lifting the United Nations' embargo.</p>

        <p>Zimbabwe's Crisis Continues  The Zimbabwe police, in a rare move, arrested the leader of a group of squatters after they beat up workers on a white-owned farm, officials said, but squatters staged other attacks elsewhere.</p>

        <p>Dominican Republic Violence  Bodyguards of the opposition's presidential candidate in the Dominican Republic shot and killed a governing party official and another man on Saturday. The opposition said the guards had acted after an assassination attempt, but the governing party said the guards had fired first.</p>

        <p>Russia Frees Chechen Rebels  Russia released 31 former rebels from a camp in northern Chechnya as part of its efforts to win wider popular support in the republic, an official said.</p>

        <p>Bush to Press Case For Social Security Change  Gov. George W. Bush intends to begin pressing his case for the establishment of individual investment accounts within Social Security, a change that would be the most far-reaching to the program since it was established in the Depression.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Decisions in Kaiser Dispute  A decision by the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board to bring unfair labor practice charges against Kaiser Aluminum and a move by the federal government that could deny Kaiser access to the heavily subsidized electricity that it has relied on for decades seem to give the 2,900 striking Kaiser workers a stronger hand.</p>

        <p>Gay-Rights Rally in Capital  A crowd estimated in the hundreds of thousands rallied in the nation's capital, celebrating the gains of the gay rights movement in recent years and vowing redoubled efforts on issues like hate crime legislation.</p>

        <p>Clinton the Butt of His Jokes  President Clinton poked fun at himself with a vengeance in his stand-up routine at the annual White House correspondents dinner.</p>
        <p>A16</p>
        <p>Gore Attacks Bush  Vice President Al Gore, in a major foreign policy speech in Boston, attacked Gov. George W. Bush in a classic incumbent strategy, one made especially classic by Governor Bush's father, then the vice president, against another sitting governor in 1988.</p>
        <p>A18</p>
        <p>Bush Camp Fires Back  The top foreign policy adviser of Gov. George W. Bush, in response to the Gore speech, said that Vice President Al Gore had misrepresented Mr. Bush's views on how to deal with Russia and China and had taken ''a series of positions that are at complete odds with how he has acted for the past seven years.''</p>

        <p>SCIENCE/HEALTH</p>
        <p>Rules Lag on Biotechnology  Scientists are creating a menagerie of genetically modified animals, promising what biotech backers say will be advantages like cheaper and more nutritious food. But critics and some Clinton administration officials say that the creatures are threatening to slip through a net of federal regulations that has surprisingly large holes.</p>

        <p>Promoter for M.T.A. Debt Also Stands to Benefit  The involvement of Bear Stearns &amp; Company in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's proposal to restructure its debt to finance its capital plans is perhaps the most striking example of the way in which Wall Street can shape public policy to its own benefit.</p>

        <p>Another Senate Candidate  A former congressman from Westchester, Joseph J. DioGuardi, announced that he would seek the support of the Conservative, Right-to-Life and Independence parties to run for the United States Senate.</p>

        <p>More Violence Against Drivers  A livery-cab driver who chased a suspected robber on foot on the Lower East Side was shot in the most serious of six violent incidents over the weekend involving cabbies.</p>

        <p>New Plan for City's Waste  Mayor Giuliani has sharply revised his long-term plan for disposing the city's household garbage. The new plan scraps proposals to build a waste plant in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, and a somewhat smaller plant near Hunts Point in the Bronx, and would make greater use the city's existing network of smaller transfer stations.</p>

        <p>A Star Denounces Producers  Patrick Stewart, the star of Arthur Miller's new drama on Broadway, ''The Ride Down Mount Morgan,'' stunned audiences at curtain calls on Saturday -- and Broadway circles in general -- by angrily denouncing the producers, including the Shubert Organization, for what he called a failure to promote the show.</p>
        <p>B4</p>
        <p>China Relics Auctioned  Christie's auctioned two relics that the Chinese government, in objecting to the sale, said had been looted from an imperial palace 140 years ago.</p>

        <p>ABC Off Some Cable Systems  The ABC television network went dark on Time Warner Cable systems in several major markets early this morning as talks between the network's parent company, the Walt Disney Company, and the cable company broke down.</p>

        <p>Calm Over Plan for Microsoft  Few in the Seattle region, where the company has its headquarters, are panicking over the idea of breaking up Microsoft. Some express an almost messianic faith in the company's chairman, Bill Gates, who has said ''no one should think that shareholder value would be preserved.''</p>
        <p>A16</p>
        <p>Software developers' reactions to the government's proposal to break up Microsoft seem muted, or outright skeptical, with some saying the plan is too backward looking.</p>
        <p>C1</p>
        <p>Stock analysts poring over Friday's filings in the government's plan said the affidavit defending splitting Microsoft in two fell short of justifying why a breakup would be good for shareholders.</p>
        <p>C1</p>
        <p>Publicis May Acquire Y.&amp; R.  The French advertising company Publicis is close to reaching an agreement to acquire Young &amp; Rubicam for about $5 billion, executives close to the talks said.</p>

        <p>Mobile-Phone Talks in Europe  Royal KPN, the largest telephone operator in The Netherlands, is in talks with Telefonica of Spain and several other companies about merging their mobile telephone operations in an effort to create a European mobile network.</p>
        <p>C14</p>
        <p>MP3.com Optimistic on Deal  The online music service MP3.com expressed guarded confidence about reaching a settlement with the Recording Industry Association of America, following a federal court ruling on Friday that MP3.com had violated copyright law by creating an online database of 80,000 major-label recordings.</p>
