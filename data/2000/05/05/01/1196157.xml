        <p>After they were eliminated by the Knicks today, several members of the Raptors were asked how they thought the New York team would do against the Miami Heat in the the Eastern Conference semifinals.</p>
        <p>Butch Carter, the coach, alluded to the history between the Heat and the Knicks, including a fight in 1998 that resulted in suspensions that played a part in the Knicks being eliminated.</p>
        <p>''Who knows what's going to happen?'' Carter said. ''You have a New York-Miami series. First of all, if there's going to be a fight, who's going to stay on the bench?''</p>
        <p>Vince Carter, the Raptors' second-year star, said the Knicks could go ''probably as far as they want to go.''</p>
        <p>''They're talented enough,'' he said. ''They have the ability. They've been there. They know what it takes. They have that in their corner. I'm just watching now. Whoever wins now doesn't matter to me.''</p>
        <p>Charles Oakley, the former Knick forward now with the Raptors, said: ''It will go seven. New York will win it.''</p>
