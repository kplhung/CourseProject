        <p>Joshua Redman's saxophone playing reflects something in our culture that you're more likely to see on television and in movies and pop music than in the rest of the jazz world: hard-sell vividness.</p>
        <p>Ten years after taking his first steps in the profession, he keeps getting more fluid as an improviser, and rather than developing the way most gifted jazz instrumentalists do over time -- which is to go deeper and become a bit less accessible, to break up the prodigal flow with serenity or truculence -- Mr. Redman comes on harder and harder. He still seems in the flush of youthful enthusiasm.</p>

        <p>Joshua Redman's saxophone playing reflects something in our culture that you're more likely to see on television and in movies and pop music than in the rest of the jazz world: hard-sell vividness.</p>
        <p>Ten years after taking his first steps in the profession, he keeps getting more fluid as an improviser, and rather than developing the way most gifted jazz instrumentalists do over time -- which is to go deeper and become a bit less accessible, to break up the prodigal flow with serenity or truculence -- Mr. Redman comes on harder and harder. He still seems in the flush of youthful enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>He got himself a new band two years ago, but it still hasn't performed much in New York. Tuesday night's early set at the Village Vanguard showed that the quartet has been honing its craft elsewhere. In the past, Mr. Redman's weaker hand has been composition, and his ballads -- in which he sometimes becomes one of jazz's more expressive players -- have sounded a little thin and showy.</p>
        <p>But his new record, ''Beyond'' (Warner Brothers), shows him writing material that has a greater modesty.</p>
        <p>The quartet, with the pianist Aaron Goldberg, the bassist Reuben Rogers and the drummer Gregory Hutchinson, is right on top of the way bands interact these days -- with improvised tempo changes, staggered dropouts and re-entrances, and hard, lean funk rhythms from hip-hop. Mr. Redman sailed through the music with a poise that made modernism look like an easy thing to pull off.</p>
        <p>The group played music from all of Mr. Redman's short career -- including a jokey, rocking tune with short saxophone bleats that sounded like hip-hop samples, and one of his first compositions, ''Blues on Sunday.'' Mr. Redman is an entertainer, and the degree to which he seems to care about popularizing what mainstream jazz has become remains remarkable.</p>
