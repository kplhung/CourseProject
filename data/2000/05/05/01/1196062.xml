        <p>IN February 1997, Don Kempf was sitting in the back row of an IMAX theater when he had what he now says was a brilliant thought.</p>
        <p>After years of working as a management consultant, he wanted to do something entrepreneurial, perhaps something involving sports. And the big screen tipped him off.</p>
        <p>''All of a sudden I had this vision of Michael Jordan, eight stories high on the screen with his tongue flying out, coming right at me,'' said Mr. Kempf, 33, a lifelong Chicago Bulls fan. ''And it was at that moment when everything clicked into place.''</p>
        <p>Now, two years after persuading the National Basketball Association and Mr. Jordan to cooperate on an IMAX film that chronicles the life of Mr. Jordan and follows him through his last N.B.A. championship run, Mr. Kempf and his brother Steve, 29, are getting a lesson in big-time sports marketing.</p>
        <p>Although the Kempf brothers raised $7.2 million to produce the 45-minute large-format film, the N.B.A. and Mr. Jordan have taken a huge stake in the project. And the league and Mr. Jordan are putting their considerable marketing muscle behind ''Michael Jordan to the Max,'' which opens at IMAX theaters nationwide on May 5.</p>
        <p>With the help of the Jordan machine, the producers are preparing a $10 million marketing blitz in one of the biggest promotions ever for an IMAX film, one that includes handing out thousands of ''Michael Jordan to the Max'' posters at N.B.A. arenas, creating giant billboards depicting ''His Royal Airness,'' and stocking IMAX sites with all sorts of Jordanalia, including a companion book to the IMAX film.</p>
        <p>''The idea is to create this ubiquitous Michael Jordan everywhere environment,'' said Karen Baker, a spokeswoman at Beyond DDB, a division of DDB Worldwide, which was hired to promote the film.</p>
        <p>The N.B.A. is also promoting the film in television spots during the playoffs on NBC, TBS and TNT. And MVP.com, the online sports retailer that Mr. Jordan founded last year with John Elway and Wayne Gretzky, is the film's top sponsor.</p>
        <p>The producers are projecting the film to gross $100 million in the first year, and Mr. Jordan's agent, David Falk, is predicting huge ticket sales.</p>
        <p>''I think this is going to take IMAX out of museums,'' Mr. Falk said. ''Just like he legitimized the air technology in sneakers, he's going to get behind this new technology.''</p>
        <p>The film will get the broadest release possible, according to the producers, opening in more than 50 of the nearly 100 IMAX theaters in the United States, rivaling the huge IMAX opening earlier this year of Disney's ''Fantasia 2000.''</p>
        <p>And the Smithsonian Institution in Washington has agreed to break its tradition of airing films only about aviation and space flight to show ''Michael Jordan to the Max,'' putting the story among its highly prized daytime slots at the National Air and Space Museum.</p>
        <p>''We're expecting a blockbuster,'' said Walton Ferrell, a spokesman at the Smithsonian. ''Funding from Congress continues to shrink, so we're encouraged to think outside the box. And we know the film will make money, and that money will go back into the educational program.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the selling of ''Michael Jordan to the Max'' is yet another example of how closely Mr. Jordan and Mr. Falk guard the superstar's image and how sophisticated they have become in marketing it.</p>
        <p>No longer content to simply endorse products, Mr. Jordan is changing the rules, redefining his marketability.</p>
        <p>''He's determined that he's the product,'' said Alan Brew, a corporate identity specialist at Addison, a branding and communications firm. ''Michael Jordan is not a sports star anymore; he's almost become a one-man Disney.''</p>
        <p>A month ago, Mr. Jordan, now an executive with the Washington Wizards N.B.A. team, told a reporter that after his multimillion-dollar sponsorship contracts expired in the next few years, he would shift toward managing his own businesses.</p>
        <p>That lesson has not been lost on the N.B.A., which has been moving aggressively to find new ways to profit from the league.</p>
        <p>N.B.A. Entertainment, a unit created in 1982, produces television and movie programming centered on the N.B.A. There is also a theme restaurant, N.B.A. City in Orlando, a series of popular N.B.A. home videos and even a sitcom in the works. And this week, the N.B.A. was host to a celebrity fashion show featuring N.B.A. players alongside the actress Carmen Electra, as a way to increase sales of its merchandise and promote the idea that the league is a trendsetter in the fashion world.</p>
        <p>''The line between sports and entertainment has become nearly nonexistent,'' Mr. Brew at Addison said. ''It's now an organization that is entertainment-based rather than sports-based.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, ''Michael Jordan to the Max,'' could not come at a better time for the N.B.A. The playoffs are just under way, and the league is suffering from television ratings that are down sharply since Mr. Jordan retired in 1998. But Mr. Jordan's star has not yet dimmed.</p>
        <p>''There's no question he has staying power; he hasn't disappeared from the map at all,'' said Gregory K. Leonard, an economist who in 1997 released a study showing that in the early 1990's, Mr. Jordan bolstered league revenues by about $53 million a year. ''But it's unclear how long this will last because there haven't been that many precedents.''</p>
        <p>The IMAX film will allow the N.B.A. to ride the coattails of the most celebrated person to ever play the game. And if the film does gross $100 million in the first year, the N.B.A. and Mr. Jordan can thank Don and Steve Kempf, who produced and directed the IMAX project with James D. Stern, a theater and film producer from Chicago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern, 40, a self-described ''hoop head'' and minority shareholder in the Chicago Bulls, helped the Kempf brothers approach the N.B.A. and Mr. Falk in early 1998. With permission, filming got under way just before the playoffs in 1998.</p>
        <p>The Kempfs, through their company, Giant Screen Sports, also raised millions of dollars to finance the project, mostly from family members, friends of the family and other private investors.</p>
        <p>But the N.B.A. and Mr. Jordan then joined the project, taking a two-thirds stake in the deal. They also had final say over the content of the film. The filmmakers also agreed to pay Mr. Jordan $1 million last year for four hours of his time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jordan spent about two hours in his former Chicago Bulls uniform performing dunks for a slow-motion sequence, which uses the same bullet-time technology that was used in the movie ''The Matrix.'' He also spent two hours sitting at center court at the United Center in Chicago, where Mr. Stern interviewed him about his career.</p>
        <p>''That's not a lot of money for Michael,'' Mr. Falk said. ''He signed a contract, and that was the only thing required.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Falk said he became involved in the project not only because it was a great way to preserve Mr. Jordan's legacy in a new format (an IMAX film can be 90 feet high by 100 feet wide) but because it was important to protect the Jordan image.</p>
        <p>Before Mr. Falk signed a contract, though, he said that there were a number of ''Jordan factors'' that had to be agreed to, and that among other things, the project had to consider the involvement of ''Michael's corporate family.''</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Falk said he hired the music supervisor from Mr. Jordan's Warner Brothers film ''Space Jam,'' and he brought in MVP.com as a lead sponsor. (Television ads from Nike and Gatorade also appear in the film.)</p>
        <p>And for those who can't get enough of Mr. Jordan, there are plans to use more of the half-million feet of IMAX film that was left on the cutting-room floor and perhaps splice together a CD-ROM, or a second feature. Don Kempf says he satisfied with the effort. ''We expect to do well with this film,'' he said.</p>
