      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial scores Senate majority leader Trent Lott in holding out for approval of nomination of Bradley Smith, ideological opponent of campaign finance laws, to head Federal Election Commission; says case for strong, meaningful campaign finance reform grows ever stronger</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Hardly anyone outside Washington may have given a thought lately to Bradley Smith, a Republican nominee to the Federal Election Commission. But the battle over the Smith nomination is becoming an embarrassment to Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader and champion of Mr. Smith's cause. To Mr. Lott's consternation, more and more senators realize the foolishness of placing an ideological opponent of campaign finance reform laws in charge of their enforcement. Yet Mr. Lott persists, strong-arming Republican senators and telling Democrats he will hold up all presidential appointments until they let Mr. Smith through.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lott's pro-Smith crusade is just the latest manifestation of his all-out opposition to cleaning up election campaigns. Having engineered a Republican filibuster against the broad ban on soft money sponsored by Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold -- a bill favored by a Senate majority -- he is preparing to ram through a phony version of reform sponsored by Senator Chuck Hagel, hoping it will provide cover for Republican senators under pressure from their constituents to vote for reform and under pressure from Mr. Lott to kill it off.</p>

        <p>Hardly anyone outside Washington may have given a thought lately to Bradley Smith, a Republican nominee to the Federal Election Commission. But the battle over the Smith nomination is becoming an embarrassment to Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader and champion of Mr. Smith's cause. To Mr. Lott's consternation, more and more senators realize the foolishness of placing an ideological opponent of campaign finance reform laws in charge of their enforcement. Yet Mr. Lott persists, strong-arming Republican senators and telling Democrats he will hold up all presidential appointments until they let Mr. Smith through.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lott's pro-Smith crusade is just the latest manifestation of his all-out opposition to cleaning up election campaigns. Having engineered a Republican filibuster against the broad ban on soft money sponsored by Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold -- a bill favored by a Senate majority -- he is preparing to ram through a phony version of reform sponsored by Senator Chuck Hagel, hoping it will provide cover for Republican senators under pressure from their constituents to vote for reform and under pressure from Mr. Lott to kill it off.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lott is reportedly offering a half-dozen federal judges for approval by the Senate in return for Democratic cooperation on Mr. Smith. Mr. Lott regards the offer as magnanimous. It is in fact insulting. For several years, he and other Republicans have thrown up one road block after another to President Clinton's judicial appointments -- a partisan debasing of the honored principle under which the Senate advises and consents on presidential nominations. This year he has allowed confirmation of only seven judges. When the tables were turned in 1992, also a hotly contested election year, a Democratic-controlled Senate was serious enough about its responsibilities to approve 66 judges nominated by President George Bush, a Republican.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lott may even throw in some more judges if that will help win the day for Mr. Smith. But federal appointments should not be subject to backroom deals. The Democrats should resist Mr. Lott's blandishments and, along with like-minded Republicans, should reject Mr. Smith.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the case for broad, meaningful campaign finance reform grows ever stronger. With each passing month, Republicans and Democrats set new records on soft money, the unregulated donations to parties that the McCain-Feingold bill would ban. A recent black-tie Republican event prompted Democrats to boast that the dress for their fund-raiser was blue jeans. Either way, the sums raised were obscene. The parties are on their way to doubling the $260 million in soft money raised in 1996. It is time for Mr. Lott to let the full Senate vote on McCain-Feingold. At the very least this will give the public a chance in an election year to judge who wants to change the existing corrupt system and who does not.</p>
