        <p>Temple's men's varsity heavyweight crew did everything it could to jeopardize its chances of winning the Georgetown Invitational Big East Championships yesterday in Washington, but the Owls survived their mishap to defeat Syracuse and win their fourth consecutive Big East rowing title.</p>
        <p>In a warmup row, Temple plowed the bow of its racing shell into one of the referees' launches and the shell began to sink. The Owls then borrowed a Syracuse boat and beat the Orangemen.</p>
        <p>Temple's victory did not come easily. Behind Syracuse by two seats 300 meters into the 2,000-meter course, Temple edged ahead at 500 meters and gained a half-boat-length lead midway through the race. Temple broke away in the final 500 meters to win by 3.28 seconds, or just under a boat length, in 5 minutes 32.46 seconds.</p>
        <p>Georgetown finished third, 12 seconds astern of Syracuse, with Boston College last in the four-boat final. Temple's varsity victory prevented a Syracuse sweep of the heavyweight men's races, as the Orangemen won the junior varsity and freshmen races.</p>
        <p>Syracuse swept the women's open-weight events, winning the varsity race by four seconds over Villanova, the junior varsity race over Miami and the freshmen race over Notre Dame.</p>
        <p>Georgetown's men's lightweight varsity captured the Big East title by defeating Boston College. The Hoyas' women's team also won the varsity lightweight Big East title.</p>
