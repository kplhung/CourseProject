        <p>A livery-cab driver who chased a suspected robber on foot on the Lower East Side was shot early yesterday in the most serious of six violent incidents over the weekend involving cabbies.</p>
        <p>The police said some of the incidents involved acts of vigilantism or retribution by cab drivers, and were rooted in drivers' concerns about their safety after the slayings of nine cabbies this year.</p>
        <p>Hours after yesterday's shooting, the injured driver, Yovanny Grullon, 35, met with more than 100 other drivers at Allen Car Service, where he works, and urged them to rely on the police to catch the suspects. ''I am grateful to be alive,'' Mr. Grullon, who was shot in the legs and the groin, said, sitting in a wheelchair and speaking in Spanish. ''Do not under any circumstances risk your life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Grullon, who was robbed at gunpoint last week, was shot about 3:50 a.m. after a plot to catch the suspected robber went awry.</p>
        <p>According to witnesses, when a man telephoned the car service, at 154 Allen Street, and asked for ride, Sergio Espinal, the dispatcher, recognized the phone number as that of a man who had called for a cab and then robbed Mr. Grullon.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Look, I got the guy,' '' Mr. Espinal said.</p>
        <p>Another driver went to get the caller, intending to take him to the local police station house, and Mr. Grullon headed for the station house  as well, Mr. Espinal and the police said.</p>
        <p>But after he got into the other car, the suspect, Luis Soto, 20, saw Mr. Grullon driving alongside, and leapt from the cab at the corner of Delancey and Norfolk Streets. When Mr. Grullon left his cab and chased the man a few feet, the man shot him with a .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol, the police and Mr. Grullon said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grullon was treated at Bellevue Hospital. The doctors told him that if one bullet had been an inch  higher it might have been fatal, said Fernando A. Mateo, president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Soto, of 189 Belmont Avenue in the Bronx, was arrested two hours after the shooting, and charged with attempted murder and criminal possession of a weapon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grullon, 35, lives with his wife and three children in the Bronx and is a native of the Dominican Republic. After moving to New York in 1990, he worked as a carpet installer until last year, when he began driving a cab.</p>
        <p>The police reported five other violent incidents in the taxi industry on Saturday and yesterday. One case involved the driver of a yellow cab,  who was slashed by a woman he chased after she refused to pay for a ride to the Bronx, and another involved a driver who was beaten after  an argument with a pedestrian in Jackson Heights, Queens.</p>
        <p>The police also charged a man with robbery after he held up a cabby at knifepoint in East New York in Brooklyn. In addition, they were searching for a man who robbed a driver at gunpoint in Arverne, Queens, and had in custody a man who was beaten by drivers after an attempted robbery near Lehman College in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mateo said emotions were running high because of the recent killings. But he said car services and his federation were calling on drivers to show restraint. ''My message to the drivers, and to the industry, is that if you see a criminal, just radio an emergency to your car base, and have the base call the police,'' he said. ''We don't want people trying anything heroic, and foolish.''</p>
