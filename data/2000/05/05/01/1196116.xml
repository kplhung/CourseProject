        <p>Gov. George W. Bush plans to push soon for a fundamental overhaul of Social Security, reopening an issue that could be among the most combustible and bitterly debated of the presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>In the next month, his aides said, Mr. Bush intends to begin pressing his case for the establishment of individual investment accounts within Social Security, a change that would be the most far-reaching to the program since it was established during the Depression.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush believes that the accounts, which would allow workers to invest a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock and bond markets, are an essential component of any plan to ensure the retirement system's long-term viability, his advisers said.</p>
        <p>Private accounts would allow workers to capture some of the historically high returns offered by Wall Street over the long run, thereby reducing the need to close a looming shortfall in Social Security's finances through benefit cuts or higher taxes, Mr. Bush's aides said.</p>
        <p>While they acknowledged that some voters would find the idea unsettling, the advisers noted that nearly half of households owned stock directly or through retirement accounts, creating a new ''investor class'' that extends well into the middle class and is increasingly eager to have control over its own finances.</p>
        <p>''People have an understanding of how markets work, and are used to securing a higher return on their savings,'' said one adviser to Mr. Bush. ''The debate on Social Security will be joined in a way that we believe will be open to new ideas.''</p>
        <p>Yet to most Democrats, including Vice President Al Gore, creating individual investment accounts is tantamount to abandoning Social Security's role as the provider of a guaranteed benefit for the elderly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides said they would portray Mr. Bush's approach as too risky for many individuals because it would leave their retirement security exposed to the ups and downs of the stock market. They expect that argument to have particular resonance if Wall Street remains as volatile as it has been in recent months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's team also intends to make a case that establishing personal accounts would have a huge economic cost because it would require using the portion of the projected federal budget surplus that would otherwise go to reducing and eventually eliminating the $3.5 trillion in national debt held by the public.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has made eliminating the public debt the centerpiece of his economic agenda, saying that to do so would push interest rates down and give the entire economy a boost. The vice president backs a plan that would leave Social Security intact but would extend its solvency to 2050 by allocating interest savings from the reduction in the national debt to the retirement system.</p>
        <p>''One of the reasons Social Security has been so successful is that it's a social compact between generations, one generation taking care of the next generation,'' said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman. ''To play around with privatizing it, when in fact there's no need to privatize it, will only lead to bad results.''</p>
        <p>Under current projections, Social Security will start paying out more in benefits than it is taking in through payroll taxes starting in 2015, as the baby boomers begin retiring in large numbers. By 2037, under current projections, it will have run through a ''trust fund'' of i.o.u.'s it has collected from the government, and from that point on will be able to pay only 75 percent of promised benefits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush plans to give a major speech on Social Security sometime in May, and to press the issue from then on, his aides said. He will not offer a detailed plan, but rather will commit himself to a set of principles that he would use as the basis for bipartisan negotiations if he was elected president.</p>
        <p>Those principles start with the establishment of private accounts. Mr. Bush will probably not specify what portion of a worker's payroll taxes could go into the accounts, but he is leaning toward making participation in the accounts voluntary, his advisers said. Under this approach, a portion of the retirement benefit would be guaranteed and a portion would fluctuate with the performance of the investment account.</p>
        <p>As the system stands now, payroll taxes on today's workers go to pay benefits for current retirees. Mr. Bush's plan would start shifting Social Security toward a system in which each worker saved something for his or her own retirement.</p>
        <p>''The key is going to be augmenting the current pay-as-you-go system with a prefunded system based on personal accounts,'' said Lawrence B. Lindsey, the Bush campaign's chief economic adviser.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush will also pledge not to increase payroll taxes, and not to reduce benefits for anyone in or nearing retirement. He has left open whether the retirement age, which is already rising gradually to 67 from 65, might eventually need to be increased again.</p>
        <p>Most of the privatization proposals put on the table in the last few years envision about two percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax paid by each worker being channeled into individual accounts. Privately, Mr. Bush's aides say they envision a plan of roughly the same scale.</p>
        <p>To divert that portion of the payroll tax into the accounts while also paying benefits to current retirees would require using all or most of the roughly $2 trillion in surplus Social Security revenues the government expects to collect over the next decade.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Gore's plan, all of the Social Security surplus would go to reducing the national debt held by the public. Mr. Bush's approach would almost certainly have to forgo large-scale reduction in the public debt. But because Mr. Bush's plan would give workers their own retirement accounts, it would decrease the government's long-term obligation to pay benefits out of tax revenues, which is another form of debt reduction.</p>
        <p>The subject is devilishly complex even for economists. It has long been an unwritten law of politics that there is little to gain and much to lose from making an issue of Social Security, and the deadlock on it in Washington over the last few years suggests that there is still great hesitancy among the general public, as well as among politicians, in grappling with its problems.</p>
        <p>The major political test is likely to be in the big industrial states that both campaigns consider essential to their electoral prospects, including Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.</p>
        <p>Those states, and other crucial battlegrounds like Florida, have high proportions of older voters, who in the past could have been counted on to react strongly against any major changes to Social Security. Democrats remain confident that Mr. Bush's proposal will help drive older voters to Mr. Gore, but Republican strategists said that assumption might prove outdated.</p>
        <p>''The question that this election cycle will test,'' said one adviser to Mr. Bush, ''is whether times have changed enough through the emergence of a new investor class, and through the recognition that Social Security is going broke, that new solutions can be found.''</p>
        <p>The adviser said that neither party could be sure of the answer. Still, the issue is likely to help Democrats mobilize their traditional constituencies. In particular, Democrats said any push by Mr. Bush to privatize Social Security would be met by stiff resistance from labor unions.</p>
        <p>''This is an enormous issue for us,'' said Gerald Shea, an economic policy strategist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''Especially if the Republican candidate promotes it, I wouldn't be surprised if this is the major issue on the minds of working families when they decide who to vote for.''</p>
        <p>In a poll last May by Princeton Survey Research Associates, 58 percent of Americans favored a system that would include private accounts. The idea was opposed by 33 percent.</p>
        <p>But the results were almost precisely the opposite when the same survey asked workers to choose between a program that guaranteed a monthly benefit based on lifetime earnings, as under the current system, and a program that would allow individual investment in the market without a guarantee. Given that choice, 59 percent favored the guaranteed payment, while 33 percent backed private investment.</p>
        <p>''The American people seem to favor the idea of individual retirement accounts in theory,'' said Evans Witt, the president of Princeton Survey Research Associates. ''The question is, how do you do it, and what does it cost, and does it put my benefits at risk?''</p>
