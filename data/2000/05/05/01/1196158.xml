        <p>While most of the basketball-viewing public is looking forward to another Knicks-Heat series, Bill Van Gundy is dreading it.</p>
        <p>''Purgatory, that's what it is,'' said Van Gundy, the father of Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy, the Miami assistant coach Stan Van Gundy and a coaching lifer himself.

        <p>While most of the basketball-viewing public is looking forward to another Knicks-Heat series, Bill Van Gundy is dreading it.</p>
        <p>''Purgatory, that's what it is,'' said Van Gundy, the father of Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy, the Miami assistant coach Stan Van Gundy and a coaching lifer himself. ''Because you got one son who is absolutely dejected. The fact that one wins, you know, you're happy. Still, at the same time, that doesn't make up for it. We just don't go to those games.''</p>
        <p>As playoff rituals go, the Van Gundys have an interesting one at their Brockport, N.Y., home when it comes to watching their sons compete against each other on the sideline.</p>
        <p>''My wife watches downstairs,'' Bill Van Gundy said. ''I go upstairs and turn the sound off. And that's how we do it. And we don't talk to each other until the game is over.''</p>
        <p>Bill Van Gundy missed a wedding to attend yesterday's Knicks-Raptors game. ''Other side of the family,'' he said, smiling.</p>
