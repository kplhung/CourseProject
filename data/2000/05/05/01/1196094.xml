        <p>Following are excerpts from remarks prepared for delivery yesterday by Vice President Al Gore to the International Press Institute in Boston, as provided by the Gore campaign:</p>
        <p>Twenty-five years ago today, the last helicopters lifted off from the roof of our embassy in Saigon. Although that brought an end to the war in Vietnam -- a conflict I witnessed with my own eyes -- it did not bring an end to its influence on our thinking about foreign policy.</p>
        <p>Even now, a decade after the end of the cold war, we hear echoes of the old arguments. Some seem to believe that with the fall of the old Soviet empire, we have nothing more to fear in the world and should dramatically cut our defense budget. Others keep insisting that we continue to prepare to face down a cold war threat that no longer exists and persistently ignore the world as it is. I believe that both groups are locked in a self-destructive argument over a false choice. . . .</p>
        <p>We are now in a new era. . . . We are now in a global age. . . .</p>
        <p>We need a new security agenda for the global age based on forward engagement. . . .</p>
        <p>In the global age, we must be prepared to engage in regional conflicts selectively -- where the stability of a region important to our national security is at stake, where we can assure ourselves that nothing short of military engagement can secure our national interest, where we are certain that the use of military force can succeed in doing so, where we have allies willing to help share the burden and where the cost is proportionate. America cannot be the world's policeman. But we must reject the new isolationism that says: Don't help anywhere, because we cannot help everywhere. . . .</p>
        <p>But perhaps the biggest change in our approach to the classic agenda is how we engage two countries that once were only known to us as enemies: Russia and China.</p>
        <p>During the cold war, we worked to contain these two powers and limit their reach. Our task in the 21st century is not making them weak, but instead to encourage forces of reform.</p>
        <p>That is why we have worked hard these past seven years to help Russia make a transition to a market-based democracy. We have helped Russia privatize its economy and build a civil society marked by free elections and an active press. We have brought Russia into a working relationship with NATO through the Permanent Joint Council and the Partnership for Peace program. We have been able to work with Russian forces successfully inside a NATO framework in the Balkans.</p>
        <p>We have helped safeguard Russian nuclear material against the danger of theft. We have made it possible for thousands of Russia's nuclear scientists and weapons experts to find peaceful pursuits. And we have helped Russia to reduce its nuclear arsenal by nearly 5,000 warheads.</p>
        <p>This work has not been without difficulty, or controversy. We strongly disagree with Russia's course in Chechnya. Russia must intensify its own work to stop the flow of dangerous technologies that irresponsible groups and rogue states can use to create weapons of mass destruction.</p>
        <p>Russia must still take decisive steps to combat corruption and achieve reform. But a new cold war is not the right path to progress. Engaging Russia is the right thing to do. . . .</p>
        <p>For these same reasons, we must also follow a policy toward China that is focused on results, not rhetoric.</p>
        <p>Make no mistake: we have strong disagreements with China over human rights and religious freedom, and over Chinese treatment of Tibet. These issues cannot -- and must not -- be ignored or marginalized. They must constantly be pursued. Human rights and human dignity speak to the deepest bonds we share, across all borders and nationalities. America has to prod China to make progress in all these areas, and as president, that's exactly what I'll do.</p>
        <p>We also have concerns over tensions building between China and Taiwan. We need to maintain our commitment to the ''one China''  policy, but urge China and Taiwan to intensify their dialogue and to resolve their problems by peaceful means. The administration is honoring its obligation to make defensive weapons available to Taiwan. But I am deeply concerned that those in the Congress who are pushing the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act are blind to its consequences: a sharp deterioration in the security of the region.</p>
        <p>It is wrong to isolate and demonize China, to build a wall when we need to build a bridge. . . .</p>
        <p>I strongly support permanent normal trade relations with China, and I will continue to press the Congress to support it this year. I support China's membership in the World Trade Organization, to make China abide by the same rules of international trade that we follow today. . . .</p>
        <p>From what we can tell of his foreign policy, Governor Bush does not prepare us to meet the grand challenges of both the classic and new security agendas. . . .</p>
        <p>Governor Bush dangerously fixates on the cold war past when speaking of the use of force. He suggests that he would not intervene to relieve even the brutal repression of ethnic cleansing and genocide. No wonder it took him six weeks to say anything about our action against the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Is that the right message for America to send to people around the globe struggling for freedom?</p>
        <p>Stuck in a cold war mindset, Governor Bush continues to view Russia and China primarily as present or future enemies. While we must remain vigilant against any deterioration in our relationships, the reality of the global age is that Russia and China are indeed competitors, but also vital partners in our efforts to tackle problems menacing to us all.</p>
        <p>Just this past week, Governor Bush used his brief meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov to issue a warning that his intention would be to build and deploy a global Star Wars system that he believes could defend the U.S. and all our allies against any missile launch from any source. In the 1990's, most serious analysts took a look at the implausibility of this endeavor, the fantastical price that our taxpayers would be expected to pay, and the dangerously destabilizing consequences of traveling down that path and rejected this notion. Governor Bush wishes to return to it, and chose the worst possible venue in which to launch -- for lack of a better phrase -- his risky foreign policy scheme. . . .</p>
        <p>When it comes to the challenges of the new security agenda, Governor Bush's foreign policy is noticeably blank. Although Africa represents a vast untapped market, has major health and environmental concerns that directly impact us, and the reaches of modern terrorism took American lives in two of our embassies on that continent, Governor Bush said that Africa ''doesn't fit into the national strategic interests.'' Is that a responsible assessment of our national interest?</p>
        <p>One has to assume that these gaps in Governor Bush's foreign policy views and experience will be filled by the ideologies and inveterate antipathies of his party -- the right-wing, partisan isolationism of the Republican Congressional leadership. Since 1994, the Republicans in Congress have recklessly tossed aside decades of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy.</p>
        <p>They have refused to adequately fund our diplomatic and international development efforts, from promoting peace in the Middle East to fighting drugs in South America. They have held our contributions to the United Nations hostage to their own political agenda for years. They have repeatedly tried to sabotage this administration's programs, even in places like Bosnia and Kosovo where what is needed is steadiness and continuity of purpose. They have made themselves the sworn enemies of a worldwide effort to deal with the global environment.</p>
        <p>And in the end, despite their constant assertion of concern for our alliances, they have rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. In one blatant partisan move, they have profoundly shaken the confidence of our allies in American steadiness, purpose and in our capacity to lead.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush joined with the isolationist, partisan Republican majority in Congress in opposing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. He chose politics over principle. . . .</p>
        <p>I believe America can do better -- for our own national security, and for the ideals we must model to the world.</p>
