        <p>IN the end, it was a shot you would not have the nerve to try in a game of H-O-R-S-E that broke the Raptors' back. It sent the Knicks into the second round of the playoffs and dispatched the Raptors to the summertime hammock.</p>
        <p>No one had ever suggested to Butch Carter of Toronto that coaching was as easy as eating noodles, but to suffer this, after all he had gone through in the past week, was to suffer abjectly.</p>
        <p>Larry Johnson, with the game on the line, squared up as nice as you please from beyond the 3-point arc, almost straightaway from the hoop, and lofted a shot that sailed high, seemed to hang for a moment like a burnt orange moon among the lights.</p>
        <p>The record crowd of almost 20,000 in the Air Canada Center grew hushed, after trying for a full game to ape the madding throng -- with uncommon success -- in Madison Square Garden. The score was 82-80, Knicks. There were 24.9 seconds left in the contest. The darlings of the hometown fans were down, two games to none, in the three-of-five-game first-round series.</p>
        <p>Johnson's shot descended, but not through the net, at least not at first, which is the conventional mode for a score from that angle. The ball bounced off the backboard, like a ricochet in a pinball machine, and plopped into the twine. ''Larry said he called 'glass,' '' Chris Childs, the Knick guard, said later, with a winner's chuckle. ''But I didn't hear it.'' Whatever Johnson did or did not call, the ball took the air not only out of the crowd, but out of the Raptors themselves. ''When the ball went in,'' said Allan Houston, the Knicks guard, ''I could see the heads of the Raptors drop.''</p>
        <p>Vince Carter, the Raptors leaper who found he could not jump as high in the playoffs as he did in the regular season, said: ''It's hard to bounce back after a shot like that. It was tough to swallow. I said to Larry: 'You didn't call glass. You should give a point back.' He just smiled.''</p>
        <p>Then Johnson made that insipid ''L'' sign, for Larry, with his arms. If he must signify, one wishes he would try to make the ''K'' sign, not only for the degree of difficulty, but for the sake of the team.</p>
        <p>The Raptors then missed a few  3-point attempts and the game was over, 87-80, with Childs adding two free throws for icing. But it was not only Johnson's shot that sank the Raptors, to be sure. One shot does not a series make. There is a cliche in sports that championship teams find a way to win. The Knicks keep finding those ways. And while accidents happen, the Knicks find a way to take advantage of even those accidents.</p>
        <p>How was it, though, that the Knicks were able to finish on top in three close games, in three games in which the outcome was in doubt until the final minute or two? Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy said he does not subscribe to the theory that experience was the key factor in the Toronto series. ''Talent is more important,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But it is what the talent does with itself that is most important. And the Knicks, as a team, faced critical games in the playoffs last year when they went to the National Basketball Association finals. This is the first time the Raptors, a team in existence for five years and with young players as a nucleus, have made it to the playoffs. Charles Oakley, a Toronto veteran, has a facility for summing things up with the quickness of Cliffs Notes, if, sometimes, not with the same transparency.</p>
        <p>''They made the plays,'' he said. ''They didn't fight the double team. They passed the ball.'' In other words, the Raptors fought the double team, which was primarily the Knicks' way of containing Vince Carter, who, during the regular season, traversed above and through the Knicks like Blackstone the Magician's floating light bulb.</p>
        <p>Butch Carter, meanwhile, was still taking heat. Doug Christie, who in the series played smaller than the  5-foot-3-inch Muggsy Bogues, to whom he lost his starting position, was complaining after the game that his coach's outside distractions hurt the team. The coach had sued Marcus Camby for defamation of character, had come out with a book saying Bob Knight was not even an earl and challenged his veterans with the assertion that none of them have yet ''stepped up'' and assumed leadership roles.</p>
        <p>''Didn't faze me,'' Vince Carter said about his coach's controversies. ''My job -- the team's job -- was on the court. To play to win. That was our only focus.''</p>
        <p>If Butch Carter learned anything about this, his first playoff series as an N.B.A. head coach -- he has built a previously ragtag team into a playoff team in a bit more than two years -- it is that he overprepared.</p>
        <p>''I should have spent less time with X's and O's and more time on talking about keeping our emotions under control,'' he said. ''But the intensity of the playoffs is so great that it was hard to anticipate.'' He is a broad-built man with a soft smile, who seems as open as an embrace. Learn anything else? ''Yes,'' Carter said. ''When you're losing, talk less.''</p>
        <p>At the conclusion of the game, Vince Carter was the last man to leave the court, as the disappointed crowd summoned the energy to cheer him.</p>
        <p>In response, he took off his basketball shoes, and tossed them. Do you usually do that, he was asked. ''No,'' he said. ''End of the season, I don't need them.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks, however, were holding tight to their footwear, believing it will be useful next Sunday in Miami.</p>
