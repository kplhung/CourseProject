        <p>A 48-year-old Bronx man who was walking near his home yesterday afternoon was struck in the head by a stray bullet during a gunfight between two police officers and a convicted robber who was released from prison six weeks ago, the police said.</p>
        <p>The victim was in a coma last night.</p>
        <p>The shootout, which occurred  about 12:20 p.m., was one frantic moment in a wild chase that began when the recently released convict stabbed two people in an apartment in Bedford Park, opened fire on a police cruiser as it arrived at a nearby corner and was captured scaling a fence at the Metro-North Railroad tracks near Fordham University seven minutes later, the police said.</p>
        <p>During the chase, the gunman,  identified by the police as Jamel Hightower, 24, briefly grabbed two hostages, including a woman on the train station platform whom he used as a shield while he fired at a pursuing detective.</p>
        <p>The authorities said last night that it was not clear whether the bullet that struck the bystander, Wilson Ramos, of 244 East 196th Street, was fired by the police or Mr. Hightower. Although the police said that the direction the officers were facing as they fired made it unlikely that they had struck him, they stressed that an investigation was being conducted and that their first impression was preliminary.</p>
        <p>''It appears at this time that the man who was shot was an innocent bystander and was struck by a bullet fired by the suspect,'' said Sgt. Brian Burke, a police spokesman. ''But that could change.''</p>
        <p>Relatives said Mr. Ramos, a father of three, had left his apartment to buy a soda for a family reunion and happened to stroll into the gunfight and was shot between the eyes. A native of Ecuador who works in a cosmetics factory, he was in critical condition and on a respirator late last night at Jacobi Medical Center. Joel Nieves, 10, one of his cousins, stood in the home fingering a white plastic crucifix.</p>
        <p>''The doctor cannot do anything,'' he said. ''Only God can save him now.''</p>
        <p>The police and witnesses said the mayhem began at 2661 Briggs Avenue, where Mr. Hightower and two accomplices got into a fight with Michael Ortiz, 22, who lives there. The nature of the fight was not clear last night. The police said they believed it was drug-related; Mr. Ortiz's mother said it was revenge for a for a fight Mr. Ortiz's wife had with another woman two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>All agreed it was vicious. Miriam Ortiz, 41, Mr. Ortiz's mother, said she arrived at his home about 12:15 and heard commotion, and she forced open the door see him covering his head, trying to fend off repeated stabbings by Mr. Hightower. Her other son, Marcelino, 6, was screaming.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ortiz said she tried to pull Mr. Hightower off her son, and Mr. Hightower punched her in her chest and swung the blade, which grazed her neck as she shifted backward. ''If I didn't lean back, I probably would have died,'' she said last night.</p>
        <p>The police said Mr. Hightower ran from the apartment with his two accomplices and a gun he had taken from Mr. Ortiz, and trotted to the corner of East 194th Street and Briggs Avenue, where he saw a police cruiser headed his way and quickly pretended to make a phone call.</p>
        <p>Inside the car were two patrol officers from the 52nd Precinct, Donn R. Maldonado, 26, and Alexander Rojas, 30, en route to Mr. Ortiz's home to answer a report of a disturbance. As they arrived at the block, the police said, they saw Mr. Hightower at the phone, and he opened fire at them.</p>
        <p>One bullet struck the driver's door, the authorities said, and the officers stopped their car in the intersection, stepped out and fired four times each with their 9 millimeter semiautomatic pistols. During the exchange of bullets, Mr. Ramos, who was standing nearby and to the officers' right, was struck in the face and collapsed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hightower was not injured, and a chase began, with officers from throughout the 52nd Precinct following him east on East 194th Street toward Fordham University.</p>
        <p>Along the way, the police said, Mr. Hightower boarded an out-of-service M.T.A. bus, which was parked at the curb, and held his gun to the driver's head. Mr. Hightower became confused, however, while watching for the police, and the driver managed to run to the back of the bus, the police said. Mr. Hightower then ran back out to the street and headed east for the railroad tracks, they said.</p>
        <p>Once there, the police said, Mr. Hightower ran onto the platform, grabbed another bystander, Patricia Murphy, and took her hostage. The police said that as Detective Dennis J. Fagan approached, Mr. Hightower stood behind Ms. Murphy and fired once, holding the barrel of the revolver so close to her head that she suffered a burn on her face.</p>
        <p>Detective Fagan returned a single shot, the police said, but missed. Mr. Hightower released Ms. Murphy, jumped down to the tracks and limped south along the tracks, where he was caught by an Emergency Service Unit minutes later as he tried to climb a fence. The gun and a knife were recovered, the police said. Mr. Hightower was found to have suffered a broken ankle.</p>
        <p>The police and prosecutors were reviewing charges late last night; none were immediately filed. Mr. Hightower's accomplices, who one police official said were his brother and sister, were found later in the day and were being questioned as well.</p>
        <p>In all, nine people were taken to Jacobi Medical Center for treatment, including four police officers with minor injuries and Mr. Ramos.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ortiz and Ms. Murphy were treated and released.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ortiz, who suffered stab wounds, was in stable condition and was handcuffed to his bed. The police said he had not been charged, but was expected to be questioned further about the origins of the revolver and the reasons behind the fight. Ms. Ortiz was furious.</p>
        <p>''I've never had such a difficult time in my life,'' she said. ''They're trying to accuse my son of something he didn't do. If my son had a gun, you don't think he'd try to defend himself?''</p>
        <p>Thomas P. Grant, a spokesman for the State Division of Parole, said last night that in 1995, Mr. Hightower had been sentenced to two to six years in prison for two attacks on women the previous year, during which he robbed and sexually abused them in Manhattan elevators.</p>
        <p>The Parole Board had twice denied Mr. Hightower parole, Mr. Grant said, ruling that he showed ''complete disregard for the well-being of members of society and total indifference to the law.''</p>
        <p>Because of time off for good behavior in prison, however, he was given a conditional release on March 15 from the Great Meadow Correctional Facility. ''This is another case where if it was up to the Parole Board, he'd still be in,'' Mr. Grant said.</p>
