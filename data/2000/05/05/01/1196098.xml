        <p>FRIENDS of Mary Frances Berry are oh so glad for the invention of e-mail.</p>
        <p>Now, when she has an idea in the middle of the night on how best to advance her vision of social justice, she will send her comrades in the struggle an electronic missive that can be read when they awake in the morning. Before, she would just call them on the telephone, no matter what the hour.</p>
        <p>''I used to call my friend Althea Simmons, who was head of the Washington office of the N.A.A.C.P., at 6:30 in the morning and say, 'My sister, so-and-so is going on. What is it we can do about it this day before the sun sets?' '' Ms. Berry said, wolfing down a muffin in a coffee shop a few blocks from the White House.</p>
        <p>''So she and I would talk and plot on the telephone to try to figure out what we could do or get other people to do, because at the end of the day I wanted to be able to say that on this day I did something, or tried to do something. I didn't want it to be that this day went by and all I did was meet some friends and have lunch.''</p>
        <p>As chairwoman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, Ms. Berry worries less about wasted days. Last week the staff of the eight-member commission produced a draft report on the practices and procedures of the New York City Police Department. Though restrained in tone, the report charged that officers engaged in widespread racial profiling, and it recommended the appointment of an independent ''entity,'' which it did not define, to prosecute officers charged with serious offenses against civilians.</p>
        <p>The report landed with a thud in the middle of the heated Senate race between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has made his record on crime reduction a centerpiece of his still-undeclared campaign. Even before the document was finished, Mr. Giuliani called the commission's investigation of his police department a partisan witch hunt designed to help Mrs. Clinton's campaign.</p>
        <p>Ms. Berry, however, waves off such notions as if swatting away a fly. ''People who don't like a recommendation will often say, well, it must be unfair, because they assume nobody's going to read the report,'' she said. ''I think people ought to read first, and then respond.''</p>
        <p>Taking on powerful people over civil rights issues is nothing new for Ms. Berry, 62. Soon after President Jimmy Carter appointed her to the commission in 1980, she castigated him for the policy of repatriating Haitian refugees. She successfully sued President Ronald Reagan for removing her from the panel. And when President Clinton withdrew his nomination of Lani Guinier as assistant attorney general for civil rights, Ms. Berry had unkind things to say about the president.</p>
        <p>''When they were about to appoint me chair of the commission, they expressed to me how hurt they were that I said all those things about him on national television,'' Ms. Berry recalled, referring to Mr. Clinton's aides. ''They wanted to know if I would criticize him once I was chair. I said, if he does anything that's anti-civil-rights, I'd be the first person. Look at the record.''</p>
        <p>Her view of herself as independent can sometimes cloud her political judgment. In attacking the commission's investigation, Mr. Giuliani focused on a $250 contribution Ms. Berry had made to Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign. Ms. Berry in hindsight acknowledged that the contribution might have been a mistake.</p>
        <p>''In retrospect, the only point I can make is that it gave those who wish to criticize me or the commission something to criticize,'' she said. ''Perhaps I should have thought of it that way. But it never occurred to me, since I knew my own history. But other people don't. So you should never give weapons to those who would like to undermine what you are doing.''</p>
        <p>Tenacity and a sense of outrage at the condition of minorities and poor people are at the core of Ms. Berry's personality, a result of her Dickensian background. Her earliest memory is of hearing her brother wailing because he was ravenously hungry and the operators of the Nashville orphanage would not give him any more food. Ms. Berry's mother had placed the two children there for a time when their father deserted the family and she did not have the means to care for them.</p>
        <p>Ms. Berry recalled the place as one where she was fed watered-down milk and rotten chicken necks and told to be grateful.</p>
        <p>''Growing up the way I did, being poor, being in an orphanage, almost starving to death by the time I was 2 and having to fight tooth and nail for survival, meant that I learned early on that you have to fight, that you have to really stick to it, that you have to be persistent,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She has always been impatient. In 1954 she was on a shopping trip with her high school history teacher, Minerva Hawkins, the day after the Supreme Court ruled in the Brown v. Board of Education decision that segregation, including that practiced in her native Nashville, was illegal.</p>
        <p>''I said to her, 'Oh, Miss Hawkins, now that means next year all the kids will be going to school together. Isn't that wonderful?' '' she said, chuckling at the memory. ''She looked at me and said, 'Not so fast, now, Mary Frances.' ''</p>
        <p>THE impatience was also fired by the fact that though she knew young civil rights advocates like Stokely Carmichael at Howard University, she had to work full time while in school and could not take part in the struggles in the South as they did.</p>
        <p>Perhaps to make up for lost time, she keeps her fire stoked. As a tenured history professor at the University of Pennsylvania and chairwoman of an independent government body who serves a fixed term and cannot be fired, she is liberated to say what she wants and pursue her liberal agenda. So at a time when some people argue that the country is fatigued with civil rights and disdainful of liberalism, Ms. Berry stands firmly -- and restlessly -- on the left and makes no apologies for it.</p>
        <p>''Progressive activism still works, just like conservative activism still works,'' she said. ''Activism works. That is, if you try to work hard and be intelligent about promoting an agenda and work with other people on it, you can usually make some changes. But you have to be sophisticated about how you do it, otherwise you do a disservice to the people you're trying to help. If you're dumb or lazy about what you do, all you're doing is getting in the way. You might as well stay at home.''</p>
