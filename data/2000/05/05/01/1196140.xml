        <p>The Mets were leading by six runs in the seventh inning today when the infielder Kurt Abbott approached Manager Bobby Valentine in the visitors' dugout at Coors Field.</p>
        <p>''When do you think a lead's safe here?'' said Abbott, who played his home games here last season as a member of the Colorado Rockies.</p>
        <p>''Not until it's at least double figures,'' Valentine replied.</p>
        <p>The Rockies scored eight times after Abbott quizzed Valentine, but the Mets survived and won, 14-11. The Rockies' five-year-old palace has a view of the Rocky Mountains, a quaint hand-operated scoreboard and pine trees and fountains near the bullpens. Everything about Coors Field is gorgeous, it seems, except the kind of baseball played here.</p>
        <p>''If you're a season ticket-holder, you've got to be tired,'' said Mets outfielder Darryl Hamilton, also a former Rockie. ''Seeing it over and over again, it takes its toll.''</p>
        <p>The Mets scored 32 runs on 50 hits over three games this weekend. Edgardo Alfonzo had four hits for the Mets today and Todd Zeile had three, but the standards for excellence are different some 5,000 feet above sea level.</p>
        <p>The player of the game on the Rockies' television broadcast: the Mets' starting pitcher, Al Leiter, who allowed six runs in seven innings.</p>
        <p>Leiter lamented afterward that the strategy that makes low-scoring games such fun is lost in Colorado. What is the strategy here?</p>
        <p>''To win by a touchdown,'' Leiter said.</p>
        <p>Leiter left in the eighth inning, which began with the sixth error of the season by shortstop Rey Ordonez and continued two batters later when Terry Shumpert's single got past left fielder Jon Nunnally for another error, scoring two runs.</p>
        <p>Turk Wendell came in to protect the 11-5 lead, but he loaded the bases on a hit batsman and a walk. Dennis Cook then came in and gave up a grand slam to Tom Goodwin, a new Rockie who has hit only 14 homers in 10 major league seasons.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's enjoyable for anybody to sit out a four-hour game and watch both teams club each other to death,'' Cook said. ''It's not baseball.''</p>
        <p>There were still five more runs to be scored, but when Ben Petrick flied out and the game finally ended, the Mets were left with two victories in three games and hearty batting averages throughout the order.</p>
        <p>Alfonzo and Zeile both said they were starting to feel better at the plate before coming to Coors; playing in Denver, Zeile said, accentuates the feeling. Alfonzo had 10 hits in 13 at-bats in the three games, and Zeile was 8 for 15.</p>
        <p>''Everything I hit was going through every hole,'' said Alfonzo, who had a home run, three singles and four runs batted in and improved his batting average 70 points this weekend.</p>
        <p>Zeile's average also now sits above .300. He has tried to concentrate on hitting the ball up the middle or to the opposite field, and he was especially pleased that all three of his hits today went to right. Among those was Zeile's first home run, a two-run shot in the fourth off the former Met Brian Bohanon (0-3).</p>
        <p>''I want to hit the ball where it's pitched,'' said Zeile, who pulled his three hits on Saturday. ''But for me to have the most success, my approach has to be the middle of the field or the right side.''</p>
        <p>Zeile said playing in Coors Field gives a hitter extra confidence. But the Mets will not benefit from the thin air, the wide outfield gaps and the Rockies' flat breaking pitches the rest of this year: this was their only visit to Denver. Valentine is happy about that.</p>
        <p>''I'm glad we're not coming back here,'' he said. ''Beautiful city, though.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The left-hander BILL PULSIPHER will start for the Mets on Monday night when they make their first trip to Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco. BOBBY VALENTINE said Pulsipher would join the Mets' rotation until BOBBY J. JONES came back from a calf strain. Jones will throw another simulated game this week and will probably need at least one rehabilitation start before returning. That should give at least a couple of starts to Pulsipher, the onetime phenom who looked shaky in spring training but improved his mechanics and sharpened his focus in two strong starts for Class AAA Norfolk. ''He's been more under control than he was this spring and in the past,'' said JIM DUQUETTE, the Mets' assistant general manager, ''and that has enabled him to throw more consistent strikes.''</p>
        <p>Catcher MIKE PIAZZA, who sustained a hyperextended right elbow and sprained right wrist in a collision at home plate on Friday, received electrical stimulus to his elbow before the game. He was advised by the Mets' trainer to take another day off on Sunday, but Piazza said he could have pinch-hit. He was not used in the game. The Mets are expected to send the reserve catcher VANCE WILSON to Norfolk to make room for Pulsipher, but they still do not know if Piazza will be able to throw Monday. The Mets have three emergency catchers behind Piazza and TODD PRATT -- MATT FRANCO, JON NUNNALLY and TODD ZEILE, though only Zeile has caught in the major leagues. Piazza will take batting practice on Monday and also play long toss, but Valentine said Pratt would make at least one more start in his place.</p>
