        <p>FOR the last two years, Web portals, the jumping-off sites for many Internet surfers, have grabbed a piece of the e-commerce pie by offering retailers prime real estate on their sites. In exchange, the portals receive stratospheric tenancy fees.</p>
        <p>Sites like Yahoo, AOL, MSN, Excite, Lycos, AltaVista and Go flourished, as retailers fought for top billing within the portals' shopping categories. In the frenzy of dot-com investment last year, those deals cost merchants like Drugstore.com, Pets.com and Value America between $2 million and $5 million for every portal they signed with.</p>
        <p>At the time, the spending made sense. Portal deals not only provided direct access to customers, but more important, they virtually guaranteed a pre-initial public offering buzz, as evidence that an electronic merchant was a major force within its retail segment.</p>
        <p>But since e-tailers have become Wall Street's personae non gratae, they have had to begin thinking of marketing budgets as something that must actually serve the purpose of attracting customers -- not investors. And so portal deals have been the second line item on the budget, after TV ads, to come under the microscope of e-tailing executives no longer willing to pay hundreds of dollars to acquire each customer.</p>
        <p>Analysts and e-commerce executives predict that the new scrutiny will affect all the portals, most drastically those ranking below the big three, AOL, Yahoo and MSN.</p>
        <p>''Everyone's re-evaluating the wisdom of portal deals,'' said Jonathan Gaw, research manager at IDC, a technology research firm. ''One reason is, we have more to re-evaluate. Three years ago, people were pulling numbers out of the air, trying to figure out how the deals would perform. Now we have some data.''</p>
        <p>And some of the data is not pretty. Jim Rose, chief executive of MobShop (www.mobshop.com), a Web site that lets groups of customers bid on items in hopes of getting a bulk discount, said he had tried a partnership deal with Excite@Home last year. That agreement, for an undisclosed amount, entailed putting MobShop links on various parts of the site.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rose said that the company calculated the number of Excite visitors who actually bought from MobShop, then divided that number into the overall price charged by Excite@Home. After discovering a customer acquisition cost of more than $1,000, MobShop promptly pulled out of the arrangement.</p>
        <p>''We can go to another site like washingtonpost.com, and it drops to $20,'' Mr. Rose said.</p>
        <p>''Last year's standard tactic among the portals,'' he said, ''was to take a category with maybe six competitors, then create three premium tenant slots for them and let them bid up the value until it ultimately got absurd. Now, there's not going to be as many e-tailers left to bid, and there aren't many who really want to, anyway.''</p>
        <p>In the future, Mr. Rose said, ''e-tailers will say, 'Here's how much we're willing to pay for customers. If you can guarantee that, fine.' ''</p>
        <p>Arno Harris, vice president of business development for WineShopper.com, an Internet-only wine store, said he looked into tenancy deals with all of the portals last year, but signed none because they were ''economically not viable.'' The fees would inflate his company's customer acquisition costs, he said, ''and customer acquisition cost is the Rosetta stone of this whole model.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harris said he planned to approach the portals again in coming months in hopes of finding what he called the silver lining of the recent shakeout among dot-com retailers -- more flexible bargaining environments. ''We're seeing more interest now among the portals in coming to more reasonable terms,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But to hear the portals tell it, Mr. Harris and other Internet merchants may not find many bargains. An executive at the At Home Corporation, for one, said e-tailers had renewed their tenancy deals at rates comparable with last year's. Jon Skinner, Excite@Home's senior vice president for  sales, said he expected the site's tenancy fees to remain stable. He disputed the notion that retailers were holding out for lower fees but said they wanted better performance. Excite@Home is controlled by AT&amp;T.</p>
        <p>To that end, Mr. Skinner said Excite@Home was developing different models for delivering customers to tenants. One  strategy is to put more shopping links into editorial areas on the site -- so-called contextual commerce. For example, Mr. Skinner said that instead of simply displaying a jewelry store on the site's shopping channel, the site's producers could create an editorial page about choosing engagement rings, and put links to the featured jeweler near the text.</p>
        <p>James F. McCann, chief executive of 1-800-Flowers.com, said performance was the watchword of the moment. Mr. McCann said that of the company's half-dozen portal deals, ''the only ones we'll renew are the ones that pay off.''</p>
        <p>He added that the company had signed a four-year $37 million deal last fall to be the exclusive floral tenant for AOL. ''We're happy with that,'' he said, ''because AOL really gets commerce.''</p>
        <p>On AOL, Mr. McCann said, he pays less than $30 to acquire each new customer, which is in line with his company's expectations and well below the industry average of $80 to $100.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the portals with the most visitors, AOL, Yahoo and MSN, had fared best recently in attracting new tenants. And according to James Kinsella, vice president for sales and marketing at MSN, part of Microsoft, perhaps two e-tailers had dropped out of tenancy deals because the bottom had fallen out of their stock. Otherwise, he said, ''we've seen an upturn in the last month,'' as media managers closed their ad budgets for the next fiscal year.</p>
        <p>J. Michael Kelly, chief financial officer of America Online, said his company, too, had avoided fallout from the financial woes of e-tailers. That, he said, was partly because AOL screened its potential tenants for financial soundness before signing deals, and partly because the number of purely dot-com tenants on the site was not significant compared with the Web extensions of traditional retailers, like Sears.com.</p>
        <p>Such a weighting, some analysts predict,  will insulate the top-tier portals from the e-tailer shakeout. ''The top portals have only a 20 or 25 percent exposure to dot-coms in terms of their tenancies,'' said Rob Martin, an analyst with Friedman Billings Ramsay, an investment firm. ''But as you go down the food chain, to Lycos, Go and the others, dot-coms become a larger percentage.''</p>
        <p>Such portals, Mr. Martin said, ''will definitely run into issues when the dot-coms start to run out of cash, and there definitely will be a shakeout among the portals as the dot-coms shake out.''</p>
        <p>Speeding that shakeout could be the tendency of some e-tailers to shy away from anything that is seen as second-tier.</p>
        <p>Pepper Evans, director of business development for Boo.com, a Web retailer of sporting goods, said her company had shunned deals with the top portals because they were too expensive. But instead of settling for more-affordable deals among the second tier, she said, the company simply looked for partnerships that relied on marketing techniques that were more narrowly focused, like creating a network of affiliates that refer prospective customers to Boo.com.</p>
        <p>''A lot of what you get from a deal with one of the top three or four sites is P.R. value, so you're taken seriously as a player,'' she said. ''You lose that with the other sites.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. McCann of 1-800-Flowers questioned the assumption by some of the portal executives that traditional retailers would, in fact, continue to prop up the demand -- and thus the costs -- for portal deals. ''Traditional retailers aren't so dumb and crazy that they can just blindly give portals a bag of money,'' he said. ''And they have different capital constraints: they have to make money.''</p>
