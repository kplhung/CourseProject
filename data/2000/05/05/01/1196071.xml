        <p>Royal KPN N. V., the largest telephone operator in The Netherlands, is in talks with Telefonica S.

        <p>Royal KPN N. V., the largest telephone operator in The Netherlands, is in talks with Telefonica S. A. of Spain and several other companies about merging their mobile telephone operations in an effort to create a European mobile network that could compete with the likes of Vodafone Airtouch P.L.C., the world's largest mobile operator.</p>
        <p>According to executives close to the talks, if Telefonica and KPN proceed with the merger, the combined company may also make a bid for Orange P.L.C., Britain's third-largest mobile phone operator.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, Royal KPN acknowledged it was in talks with Telefonica after postponing a spin-off and sale of shares of its mobile operations that would have created a $9.1 billion windfall for the company. The offering had been scheduled for this week.  In a statement explaining the postponement, Royal KPN said,  ''Discussions with a potential strategic partner could have a material effect on the business of KPN Mobile, and consequently be of importance to an investor in KPN Mobile shares.''</p>
        <p>The two companies could decide to abandon the effort at any point, the executives stressed. And KPN may also look at other possible partners.</p>
        <p>KPN and Telefonica are hungrily eyeing Orange, which will be spun off or sold by Vodafone within the next six months as part of that company's agreement to buy Mannesmann A. G. of Germany. Since both Telefonica and KPN dropped out of an auction for Britain's third-generation mobile license last month, the only way into the British mobile phone market for them is to buy Orange. But there are likely to be other bidders for Orange, and it is not expected to come cheap. Analysts estimate Orange will be sold for about $50 billion.</p>
        <p>Telefonica had been also planning to spin off its mobile phone unit and sell shares of the company to the public.</p>
        <p>It was unclear yesterday whether it would proceed with that offering.</p>
