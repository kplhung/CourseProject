        <p>Hy Edelstein letter on Apr 27 article holds children must first learn traditional mathematics methods before being exposed to constructivist principles</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The New, Flexible Math Meets Parental Rebellion'' (front page, April 27): For many elementary math teachers schooled in traditional methods, relearning math on constructivist principles was a thrilling and motivating experience. They came to see mathematics in a new light, its operations and abstractions all fitting together in beautiful, logical ways.</p>
        <p>This happy effect on teachers alone is enough to recommend constructivism -- but not to the exclusion of traditional methods.</p>

        <p>This happy effect on teachers alone is enough to recommend constructivism -- but not to the exclusion of traditional methods.</p>
        <p>Children need the scaffolding provided by memorizing basic math facts and certain useful algorithms on which to ''construct'' their knowledge. None of us have ever learned and understood any complex system without memorizing whole blocks of facts and procedures even before we completely understood their meaning.</p>
