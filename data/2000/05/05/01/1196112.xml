        <p>The first American member of Congress to go to Iraq to assess the impact of economic sanctions on the population has concluded that while some of the suffering he saw was ''heartbreaking,'' he could not support lifting the embargo imposed by the United Nations after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.</p>
        <p>Representative Tony P. Hall, an Ohio Democrat, visited Iraq from April 16 to 20 and released a report this week that called for more attention to the Iraqi population's problems by the United States.</p>
        <p>''I left Iraq convinced that a great deal more could be done to address its people's humanitarian needs, and I am determined to do all I can to persuade the U.S. government to take these steps,'' he said after being shown examples of daily life in Iraq by representatives of Unicef, the Red Cross and Red Crescent societies and the Iraqi Health Ministry.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hall said that Iraq continued to pose a military threat and that until the government of Saddam Hussein cooperates in eliminating weapons of mass destruction as required by the United Nations, ''lifting sanctions would be irresponsible.'' American opponents of sanctions had hoped to enlist his support.</p>
        <p>''If Iraq's government would show it is serious about easing its people's suffering -- instead of using their problems to support its bid to end sanctions -- it would be easier for me to see sanctions as the primary culprit,'' Mr. Hall said in his report.</p>
        <p>He criticized Iraq for trying to import items that could have military uses under cover of the program that allows Iraq to sell unlimited quantities of its oil to meet civilian needs. That tactic has contributed to delays in the Security Council process of approving import contracts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall, who has been active in international relief and development projects since he was a Peace Corps volunteer 30 years ago, has been sympathetic, he said, to calls from  religious leaders and aid workers who contend that sanctions are causing suffering for civilians and who demand that the United Nations lift them. But he said he did not believe that ending the embargo would provide much comfort to Iraqis.</p>
        <p>''That said,'' Mr. Hall wrote, ''I also believe that the U.N.'s Sanctions Committee, and particularly its U.S. representatives, ought to use much better judgment.'' He said that too many Iraqi purchases were held up because of a very small percentage that raise security concerns.</p>
        <p>He also recommends that to show its concern for ordinary Iraqis, the United States should support a proposed World Health Organization study on the effects of depleted uranium or other chemical pollutants used in ammunition during the Persian Gulf war against Iraq in 1991. Iraqis say those substances are contributing to high rates of leukemia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall said such a study could also aid American veterans of that war who have lingering illnesses or questions about their exposure to possibly harmful materials.</p>
        <p>Measures to build confidence are needed on both sides, Mr. Hall said in his report, in which he described the suffering of many Iraqis as terrible and said damage to health and morale was bound to last a long time. ''Sanctions imposed by the United Nations are partly to blame,'' he said, ''but it is the stalemate -- and not the sanctions -- that causes the Iraqis to suffer.''</p>
