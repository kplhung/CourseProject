        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>After a hectic round of shopping at Macy's, I got in line for an M6 bus going downtown. A second M6 pulled into line and the driver started to honk. Too tired to move to the second bus, I stayed where I was. Soon the driver got off and started shouting in mock frustration that his bus was just as good and why didn't we want to get on? I told him that if it would make him happy, I'd get on. He helped me with my two heavy bags and when we got on the sparsely populated bus announced, ''Look, my shower gifts have arrived.'' I jokingly said, ''Yes, don't we make an adorable couple?'' and chastised him for being late as the other passengers laughed.</p>

        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>After a hectic round of shopping at Macy's, I got in line for an M6 bus going downtown. A second M6 pulled into line and the driver started to honk. Too tired to move to the second bus, I stayed where I was. Soon the driver got off and started shouting in mock frustration that his bus was just as good and why didn't we want to get on? I told him that if it would make him happy, I'd get on. He helped me with my two heavy bags and when we got on the sparsely populated bus announced, ''Look, my shower gifts have arrived.'' I jokingly said, ''Yes, don't we make an adorable couple?'' and chastised him for being late as the other passengers laughed.</p>
        <p>We continued talking and joking and soon started in a rousing rendition of ''The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round.'' When new passengers  boarded, giving us puzzled looks, we added a verse: ''The new people on the bus think we're weird, really weird . . .''</p>
        <p>When I got up to leave, the driver and I joked about our future wedding and everyone congratulated us. The driver carried my bags off the bus and put them on the curb. Then he took my hand and helped me down the steps, much to the confusion of the people waiting to get on. It was the best ride I've ever had.</p>

        <p>BEAUTY IS IN THE EAR</p>
        <p>Her voice can pierce the hubbub</p>
        <p>at the upscale coffee bar,</p>
        <p>Confiding to sheer strangers</p>
        <p>she is practically a star.</p>
        <p>Her gaiety is heard by all,</p>
        <p>Her laugh, a strident screech,</p>
        <p>Reverberating through the room</p>
        <p>to punctuate her speech.</p>
        <p>She casually spews language</p>
        <p>that would make a sailor blush --</p>
        <p>Oh, for the days when ''ladies''</p>
        <p>never spoke above a hush!</p>
        <p>In casual designer jeans</p>
        <p>alluring she appears,</p>
        <p>Yes, gratifying to the eyes --</p>
        <p>and grating to the ears!</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>On that snowy day in April, I was shopping for groceries at a store in Brooklyn. When the clerks there told me they were out of fish tails, I decided to call my wife, who had told me that it was the only store with fish tails that she liked.</p>
        <p>I put a quarter in a pay phone and dialed. A voice answered, ''Hello?''</p>
        <p>''Min-er?'' I asked in Chinese -- that's my wife's first name.</p>
        <p>''Yes!''</p>
        <p>The voice sounded different. ''You are?'' I asked.</p>
        <p>''Yes!''</p>
        <p>I thought with snow in April, anything was possible. So I proceeded to tell her that the store had no fish tails.</p>
        <p>''What are you talking about and whom are you looking for?'' the voice broke in.</p>
        <p>I told her my wife's name again and this time added the last name.</p>
        <p>''No, my last name is . . . '' she said.</p>
        <p>Where else in America can you make a wrong-number phone call in Chinese and have someone with the same first name as your wife answer it? San Francisco, maybe?</p>

        <p>Robert Resnick of Boca Raton, Fla., was in Manhattan to attend a physics meeting at Columbia University. He was guided to the correct subway and once aboard asked one of his fellow passengers, ''Where do I get off for Columbia University?'' With a perfectly straight face, the man replied: ''Oh, that's easy. Just watch me and get off one stop before I do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Resnick was quite certain that the man wasn't aware of his absurd reply. He did the logical thing -- thanked the man and got the information from another passenger.</p>
        <p>Scene: The bus stop on Fifth Avenue near 42nd Street.</p>
        <p>Action: A young woman, querying the driver before she boards, ''Does this bus stop at 34th Street?'' Satisfied with the answer, she shepherds a little girl, apparently her younger sister, onto the bus. The two get into a conversation with a good-looking young man.</p>
        <p>Observer: Marisa M. Hagan, who overhears the older sister laughingly tell the young man that they are not tourists.</p>
        <p>Big sister: ''We live in the Village.'' Pause for punch line: ''The name of the village is Minneapolis.''</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>We were staying in a hotel while our bathroom was being renovated and left the care of our reclusive cat, Sasha, to a cat sitter. The sitter noticed that Sasha's food hadn't been touched, but  we decided she was probably hiding, upset at all the activity going on. Some 36 hours later I went into the bathroom to check on the progress and heard a tiny cry. It seemed to come from behind the wall. The superintendent, the handyman and the police, none of whom really believed she was in the wall, failed to get Sasha out. Then we called the firefighters at the local firehouse (Squad 18). The men came with lights flashing and axes ready and got her out in 10 minutes -- dusty, thirsty, hungry. We figured she jumped into a large hole left by the workers and was sealed in when they installed the medicine chest. The next morning one of the firefighters called to see how she, and we, were doing.</p>
        <p>Six months later we had a minor fire in our building. Sasha woke us up and ran to the door. There was the same fireman. A friend later said, ''I think she has a thing for firemen.'' And so do I.</p>
        <p>SUE BUCK</p>
        <p>Peter Rogers was one of the comparatively few men at the recent 92nd Street Y program featuring Helen Gurley Brown discussing her new book, ''I'm Wild Again.'' He was scheduled to have dinner with Mrs. Brown and her husband, David, after the event. Sitting alone before the program began, he was approached by a woman he had never seen.</p>
        <p>She didn't bother with preliminaries. ''Are you married?'' she asked. He was so startled that he was temporarily speechless but then he allowed that no, he wasn't married. ''Good,'' she said. ''I'm here with my husband and a friend of mine and we'd like you to join us for dinner after this is finished tonight.''</p>
        <p>He voiced his regrets, but he's still a little curious about what kind of an evening it would have been.</p>
        <p>Jonathan C. Taube overheard two women having this conversation as they left a theater in Greenwich Village.</p>
        <p>First woman: ''Let's take the 14th Street crosstown bus. The Ninth Street bus never comes.''</p>
        <p>Second Woman: ''You're right. The bus hasn't been coming for years.''</p>
