        <p>Sidney Blumenthal, an aide to President Clinton, chatted amiably with the supermodel Heidi Klum at the George magazine cocktail party before a White House correspondents' dinner on Saturday night. Kevin Spacey walked through the crowd at the Washington Hilton as a flock of camera crews trailed him.</p>
        <p>Christie Brinkley stood in front of a camera set that was specifically constructed for the occasion by George for those guests with publicity needs beyond those of ordinary civilians. With television lights blazing, Ms. Brinkley spoke to a reporter from Access Hollywood about the state of politics in America.</p>
        <p>Frank Lalli, George's editor in chief, stood off to the side and observed the panoply of celebrity before him, a rapt smile on his face. He had invited more celebrities to sit at his three tables than had any other magazine at the dinner had. And even if actress Hilary Swank and the director James Cameron were unable to make it, and Regis Philbin sat with a Time Inc. table, George still managed to attract the model Gisele Bundchen, the actor Tobey Maguire, Patricia Hearst, the director John Waters, the actress Bai Ling, Ms. Klum and Mr. Spacey, who starred with the President of the United States in a short film spoof about life after the White House.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lalli knows that George, the political magazine founded by John F. Kennedy Jr. in 1997, can use all the flash and strobe lights it can get. Even before its publicly adored, politically connected and publicity-generating editor died in a plane crash last July, the magazine was suffering from sluggish ad sales and stagnant circulation. Fearing that his corporate partner, Hachette Filipacchi Magazines, a unit of the Lagardere Group, was about to pull out of George, Mr. Kennedy had in the last week of his life gone in search of alternate financing.</p>
        <p>The terrible irony of George magazine is that it took the sudden death of its editor, upon whom the magazine's success was first hinged, to enhance its odds of survival. The publicity surrounding the plane crash in which Mr. Kennedy died re-ignited the public's interest in the magazine, significantly bumping up newsstand sales and recapturing the fancy of Jack W. Kliger, the Hachette chief executive who had stepped into the job only two weeks before Mr. Kennedy's death and had been considering pulling his company's support.</p>
        <p>But with its mix of politics and entertainment, George has always been an odd creature, as odd as the cover subject of the first issue: the model Cindy Crawford dressed like George Washington. Because that odd-duck editorial mix never quite took off, many in the magazine industry and the advertising business began to feel vindicated when the magazine was on the respirator.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Lalli, George's editor in chief since December, must make the magazine a success. And while Mr. Kennedy was fond of the phrase ''politics and entertainment,'' Mr. Lalli's stump speech focuses on ''politics, power, pop culture and people,'' which is to him a magical -- and conveniently sibilant -- formula for success.</p>
        <p>But there is still a long way to go. Advertising pages were down 74.4 percent in January through March from the similar period last year, according to the Publishers Information Bureau. That was a 70.3 percent drop in estimated advertising revenue, from a reported $3.4 million, to $1 million.</p>
        <p>In 1999, the financial outlook was not that strong to begin with. The magazine lost more than $8 million, said two former staff members, , while Hachette also paid $10 million to the Kennedy family to buy out Mr. Kennedy's 50 percent share of the magazine last fall. Mr. Kliger has also contributed a substantial sum for added marketing efforts -- much to the dismay of the publishing staff at Mirabella magazine, another Hachette publication, who said last week that they believed his investment in George contributed to their magazine's downfall. Mr. Kliger announced last week that he would close Mirabella.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Kennedy's death, circulation at George had jumped so much that Mr. Kliger said that he would change the rate base -- the circulation guaranteed to advertisers -- to 500,000 from 450,000 in September. Newsstand sales jumped by 148.3 percent on average for the last six issues of 1999 -- five of which came after Mr. Kennedy's death. There were thousands of new subscribers. Total sales were up by 38.3 percent in the same period.</p>
        <p>The October issue, packaged as a special tribute to Mr. Kennedy, was so popular that the online auction site eBay is currently accepting bids of $50 a copy for it.</p>
        <p>The enthusiasm at the newsstand charmed Mr. Kliger. But whether any of Mr. Lalli's issues will wind up as objects of fevered battles on eBay is another question. Mr. Lalli has the unenviable task of not only stepping into a job that several editors had declined but of filling the shoes of Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Lalli, 57, will not be tailed by paparazzi if he roller blades through Central Park. His most notable previous position was as managing editor of Money magazine, which is published by Time Inc. He held that post until July 1998, when he became a senior executive editor at Time Inc. He parted company with Time last year and announced that he would start a magazine consulting firm. A few months later, Mr. Kliger plucked him for the job.</p>
        <p>''My intention is not to reinvent George magazine,'' Mr. Lalli said in an interview last week. ''It is to fulfill John's vision. I would not have taken this job if I did not believe that the magazine could be a positive political force and inform readers and engage them. And of course, sell copies.''</p>
        <p>The May issue is the first that fully bears his stamp. Mr. Lalli prepared two covers: the cover article on the newsstand edition, ''The Untold Elian Story'' details the history of the Cuban boy's family and traces the lives of the Cubans who accompanied him and died on the ocean journey. The article, by Ann Louise Bardach, was featured on a segment of ''60 Minutes'' on April 23, the night before the issue arrived on newsstands, a public-relations feather in Mr. Lalli's cap. In another article, an excerpt from Betty Friedan's new autobiography, Ms. Friedan revealed that her husband had physically abused her.</p>
        <p>''With those stories, we have answered the most important question,'' Mr. Lalli said. ''Which is, can a monthly magazine about politics break news? The answer is yes.''</p>
        <p>As magazines sometimes do, George set a different cover on the issue sent to subscribers. The cover article -- ''Will the Biggest Liar Win?'' -- argues that Al Gore and George W. Bush have distorted the truth and is not likely to land the magazine on ''60 Minutes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lalli has widened the editorial mix to attract more mass-market readers. He has hired a fashion editor, for example, from Detour magazine. He has also added a columnist from New York magazine, Michael Gross, who has also written books about the modeling industry and most recently the baby-boomer generation.</p>
        <p>But there are some decidedly silly moments in Mr. Lalli's first issue. In a four-page spread ''George Goes to the Oscars,'' the editors brought what they described as ''a slightly frayed cardboard likeness'' of Hillary Rodham Clinton and asked celebrities to pose with it.</p>
        <p>In another article, ''Spin with Me, Rudy,'' the actress Heather Locklear poses in a form-fitting gown; the text accompanying the picture is advice -- from the character she plays on the television show ''Spin City'' -- to Rudolph W. Giuliani on how he can beat Mrs. Clinton in the Senate campaign.</p>
        <p>And the last page features the Doonesbury cartoon character Duke offering his opinion on what he would do if he were President.</p>
        <p>And if those last two examples are reminiscent of the TV commercials in which soap opera actors advertising aspirin proudly intone ''I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV,'' Mr. Lalli defended those articles as an essential part of the magazine's entertainment mix.</p>
        <p>''I think those pieces fit with our not-politics-as-usual mix,'' he said. ''The readers want to be informed,  and they want insight, but they also want to be entertained.''</p>
        <p>There are also some questionable moments on the advertising side.  The May issue features an ad for the George Magazine Sweepstakes, in which readers are asked to answer questions about the advertisements. One question asks readers, ''Ralph Lauren has a new fragrance. What is it? (see pages 2-3).''</p>
        <p>And there is the kind of advertisement that scares off media planners looking for affluent readers -- An ad for a ''New Revolutionary European Baldness Treatment.''</p>
        <p>While it is too early to forecast the reaction of the mainstream advertising community, many advertisers so far have remained largely unreceptive.</p>
        <p>Alan Jurmain, the director of integrated media services at Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners , said that he was skeptical. ''Any advertiser likes to be in a magazine that is vital and topical and, perish the thought, hot, but George is not any of those things at this stage of the game,'' he said. ''It is a work in progress.''</p>
        <p>Others are keenly enthusiastic. David Verklin, the chief executive of Carat North America, a media services company that is a division of Aegis, and who advises clients like Pfizer, CBS, Midas and America Online, said that he was pleasantly surprised by the May issue. He said that the magazine under Mr. Lalli feels less like an insider publication.</p>
        <p>''It's got more of a sense of humor, and is attempting to describe the political experience in a broader and more mainstream way,'' he said. ''Because of that, I am frankly much more open-minded about George's future now than I have been any time in the last 12 months.''</p>
