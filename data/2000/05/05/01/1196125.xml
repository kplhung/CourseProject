        <p>Roger Clemens drove from Yankee Stadium to his apartment in Manhattan last Monday night, seething about a terrible split-finger fastball that he had thrown to Butch Huskey. Clemens admitted that reflecting about how the pitch floated in the air like a batting practice fastball upset him because he realized that he should have simply uncorked a four-seam fastball, his trademark power pitch.</p>
        <p>So Clemens jogged to the mound against the Toronto Blue Jays yesterday and reminded himself to be aggressive. Do not get beat with your second- or third-best pitch, Clemens repeated. When in doubt, just throw heat. Somewhere in the corner of the dugout, Joe Torre smiled. Finally, he must have thought.</p>
        <p>Torre has gently prodded Clemens to be more aggressive and to stop trying to throw every pitch perfectly. Clemens can still throw his fastball by hitters and, as much as he needs his ancillary pitches to be successful, there are times when the Yankees would prefer it if Jorge Posada put down one finger and Clemens nodded and executed. ''Here,'' Clemens's body language should say, ''try to hit it.''</p>
        <p>Clemens used that assertive approach for seven sturdy innings in helping the Yankees glide to a 7-1 victory over the Blue Jays yesterday at Yankee Stadium. It was the first time Clemens had faced the Blue Jays since they traded him 14 1/2 months ago, and he performed more like the pitcher who left Toronto with back-to-back Cy Young awards than the pitcher who has rarely had back-to-back superb starts with the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''That's the guy who used to pitch against us all the time,'' Torre said. ''I used to think it was unfair.''</p>
        <p>It is rare when Clemens, a perfectionist, acknowledges that he made a mistake or that something bothered him. Clemens does not like to blame anything for sloppy outings, figuring that he should have been strong enough to overcome any obstacles.</p>
        <p>But Clemens (2-2) did a little of both yesterday when he explained how a 7-3 loss to the Twins in his previous start irked him because of Huskey's two-run single in the first and how he has probably not thrown enough fastballs. Huskey is a poor fastball hitter, so that at-bat was especially bothersome to Clemens.</p>
        <p>''Maybe I was trying too hard to pitch not to give up runs instead of just continuing to pound and be myself,'' Clemens said. ''If I've got a live fastball, I can continue to do that.''</p>
        <p>Clemens worked deliberately yesterday, sometimes staring at the seams on the baseball for several seconds and continually digging at the dirt around the rubber until his right foot felt comfortable.</p>
        <p>He is not a quick worker, but he was slower than usual, thinking a little longer before each pitch and thinking about fastballs. There was Clemens striking out Jose Cruz Jr. on a 2-2 fastball to start the game. There was Clemens using mostly fastballs to strike out the side in the third. There was Clemens getting through a first-and-second jam in the fifth by whiffing Brad Fullmer with a splitter. Unlike the splitter to Huskey, Clemens's pitch to Fullmer dived out of the strike zone. Still, the fastball set it up.</p>
        <p>''I'm throwing as hard as ever and just having the confidence to race it in there and take your chances,'' said Clemens, who allowed seven hits while walking two and fanning eight. ''I'm sure somewhere throughout the season, I might get beat on it. But it's my best pitch. That's why I do the work I can do to continue to be a power pitcher.''</p>
        <p>An approving Torre, perhaps trying to keep Clemens on this power path, said, ''He gets us pumped up when he goes out there with that type of energy and shows his aggressiveness like he did today.''</p>
        <p>After Clemens subdued the Jays in the fifth, Paul O'Neill ignited a very creaky offense by slicing a three-run double off Roy Halladay with two out in the bottom of the inning. The Jays nicked Clemens for one run in the sixth, but Shane Spencer's two-run homer sparked a four-run sixth for the Yankees. Clemens and the Yankees flew to Cleveland after the victory, a much more enjoyable ride than Clemens's drive home to Park Avenue last Monday.</p>
        <p>''That's what you hope to do every time out,'' Clemens said. ''If I can stay away from mistakes, I should be able to put up zeros and give us a chance.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>CHUCK KNOBLAUCH aggravated the injury to his bruised left hand while striking out in the eighth inning, but the exasperated second baseman said he would start against the Indians tonight. ''It's very tiring, very frustrating,'' Knoblauch said. ''You try to get in the best shape possible and stuff like this happens.'' . . . JORGE POSADA was drilled in the left hand by a pitch thrown by WILLIE RANDOLPH, the third-base coach, in batting practice. Posada slammed his bat twice and glared at Randolph. Manager JOE TORRE checked Posada's hand, but he was fine and went 0 for 1 with three walks. . . . FELIX JOSE, who made it to the major leagues on Saturday after a five-year absence and singled in his first two at-bats, was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained left groin. CHRIS TURNER, a catcher who has also played first base and the outfield, was recalled from Class AAA Columbus. The Yankees put first baseman NICK JOHNSON on the 60-day disabled list to get Turner on the 40-man roster. Johnson has not played since injuring his right wrist in March. . . . SCOTT BROSIUS went 4 for 4, pushing his average from .125 to .300.</p>
