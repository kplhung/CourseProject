        <p>Congressional conferees have reached a sketchy agreement on external review, a key component of the patient's bill of rights. It attracted scant attention but could have a big impact.</p>
        <p>The legislation would establish a federal right for patients in managed care to appeal to an independent panel of medical experts after refusals by their plan to pay for treatment. The value of external review was not in dispute, but the principles the outside medical experts should use were an issue. The conferees decided that the experts must base their decisions on scientific evidence rather than, for example, local practice standards.</p>
        <p>Studies show that perhaps a third of medical treatments lack scientific justification and are probably unnecessary. Surgeons in some parts of the country perform invasive heart and breast surgeries many times more often than do surgeons in other parts for reasons unrelated to the medical condition of patients. Habit drives the treatment. Doctors in one place or the other are doing the wrong thing.</p>
        <p>The conferees would require the review panels to base their decisions on published academic articles or other reliable evidence. The idea is to replace habits with the teachings of science. If so, the patient's bill of rights could transform how medicine is practiced everywhere in the country.</p>
        <p>Yet for all its promise, the agreement ducks the issue of costs, denying the harsh reality that no health care system can afford to pay for every medically useful treatment. Physicians often have a choice between equivalent, or nearly equivalent, treatments that cost hugely different amounts. Will external review undermine the ability of health plans to steer patients to cost-effective care?</p>
        <p>The conferees believe that is unlikely and cite the encouraging record from plans that are already required under state laws to practice various forms of external review. But if they are wrong and medical costs start soaring, expect health plans to write hundreds of new restrictions into their contracts, telling patients exactly what the plan will and will not pay for under specific circumstances. That could force doctors to follow overly rigid prescriptions. External review will become a big idea in constant need of adjustment.</p>
