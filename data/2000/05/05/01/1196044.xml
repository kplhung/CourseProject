        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Sisters Leave Pain, and Many Questions, for India'' (news article, April 24):</p>
        <p>The primary cause of suicide among young women in India is likely the demand for unreasonable dowries, without which suitable matches cannot be found. Newspapers in India have often reported such events.</p>
        <p>One account told of three sisters who hanged themselves after overhearing their parents' agonized discussion of how to pay for suitable grooms for their daughters. As the girls explained in a suicide note, they were sorry to be the cause of their parents' distress.</p>
        <p>New Delhi newspapers reported that in 1987, 65 women in Delhi province were forcibly burned alive (often with their baby daughters) by their in-laws because of dissatisfaction with the dowry. The families faced no murder charges and were then permitted to arrange more profitable matches. Suicide by hanging may seem a kinder way out.</p>
