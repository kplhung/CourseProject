        <p>As in Zimbabwe, to the south, Kenya has a problem with the distribution of land and with the many angry people who do not have any.</p>
        <p>David Muriethi Githui, for example, illegally built a hut on a small plot -- 1 wife, 8 children, 2 cows and, truly, 10 sheep -- on a narrow strip of land less than 20 feet wide between a rich man's tea plantation and the road.</p>
        <p>He lives, along with 1,500 other squatters here, pretty much in the gutter. So he is sympathetic to the black Zimbabweans who are trying to take over farms owned by whites there. He would not mind, in fact, if poor people in Kenya, with a colonial past similar to Zimbabwe's, did the same thing, though perhaps, he said, with less violence.</p>
        <p>''The white people here in Kenya don't deserve land,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But a friend and a fellow squatter,  Paul Kanyiri, reined him in with a reminder of the complexity of the land issue in Kenya.</p>
        <p>''The big problem is not white people in Kenya,'' he said. ''The big problem is our own leaders.''</p>
        <p>As in Zimbabwe, there is no question that British colonialists set the stage for a serious land crisis in Kenya. They herded Africans into reserves, selling huge tracts of land for almost nothing to white settlers and creating, along the way, the mythic ''Out of Africa'' era of tea parties and coffee plantations.</p>
        <p>But 37 years after independence, the source of the problem is not so clear.</p>
        <p>There are still white farmers, but most have sold out or gone into business with Africans. Many of their partners have ties to President Daniel arap Moi. Mr. Moi himself is one of the nation's largest landowners, as well as one of its richest men.</p>
        <p>So it was not surprising that the government reacted swiftly with threats to prosecute anyone who incited violence, after an opposition politician, Stephen Ndichu, began urging black Kenyans to take over large farms north of the capital. The farms are owned by foreign companies and thus assumed to be controlled by whites.</p>
        <p>''Government functionaries are partners with white landowners,'' explained Smokin Wanjala, a lawyer in Nairobi and an expert on land issues.  ''These interests are inextricable. So to attack or invade those farms will be a direct invasion or attack on the local elite.''</p>
        <p>Few experts believe that Kenya is teetering, at the moment anyway, around the same kind of violence that has punched so deep a hole into Zimbabwe in recent months. But the anger is there.</p>
        <p>In a nation of 27 million people, Mr. Wanjala said, at least 5 percent of the country's people live as squatters. The unemployment rate is about 45 percent. Farm workers on tea, pineapple and coffee plantations north of Nairobi, in Mr. Ndichu's parliamentary district, have been demonstrating to improve their subsistence-level wages.</p>
        <p>That land, Mr. Ndichu said in an interview, ''should be returned to Kenyans -- it comes in the guise of foreign investment but it doesn't help us at all.''</p>
        <p>North of Nairobi, the capital, squatters and the police have clashed recently at land owned by the East African Tanning and Extract Company, owned by the British company Lonrho. Lonrho in turn has Kenyan directors close to Mr. Moi.</p>
        <p>Meantime, a group calling itself the Nandi Warriors -- after the tribe that originally owned the land -- has been threatening to take the land by force, while the company has been trying to sell the land off for more than local people will pay.</p>
        <p>Paul Muite, a member of Parliament considered one of the brightest of Kenya's young politicians, though he too has been accused of corruption, said these all are signs of how Kenya could come apart, and perhaps over land.</p>
        <p>''The potentially explosive Kenyan situation should not be underestimated,'' he said. Mr. Muite believes that Kenya must embark on serious land reform as part of an overall restructuring of the country and its Constitution, or there may be violence to press for change, as in Zimbabwe.</p>
        <p>One major question is whether the 3 to 4 percent of the Kenyans who are white, who on the whole have a far better economic life than black Kenyans, would become the targets, as they have in Zimbabwe. Mr. Muite thinks so.</p>
        <p>''The whites regrettably become very visible,'' he said. ''The whites will become scapegoats.''</p>
        <p>Robert Shaw, a white Kenyan and economic analyst here, said the issue is driven more by class. ''If those feelings were stirred up,'' he said, ''I think everyone who is a large landowner is at risk. The resentment of the deprived -- it knows no barriers in terms of race.''</p>
        <p>Whites, in fact, occupy an odd social position here. They are far less visible than they once were, without representation in Parliament or in the businesses that most Kenyans encounter every day. While the white population is by no means loved by ordinary Kenyans, there appears to be far more resentment against the government.</p>
        <p>People accuse the country's leadership of destroying the country. And people of Indian descent, the merchant class, seem to stir more resentment than whites because of a  closer economic contact with black Africans over everyday matters like the costs of vegetables and rent.</p>
        <p>Here in Kagoshi, Kariuki Karuku, born in 1926, summed up many of the ambiguities. He was a Mau Mau soldier who fought the British in the mid-1950's. The aim, he said, was not only to gain independence, but also to acquire land.</p>
        <p>''In that time of King George and Queen Elizabeth,'' he said, ''those people gave us a lot of problems.''</p>
        <p>But life did not get better for Mr. Karuku after independence in 1963. Like many other Mau Mau soldiers, he was promised land but never got it. He lived in a forest near Mount Kenya, tending trees in exchange for the right to farm a small plot of public land, until the late 1980's.</p>
        <p>Then the government expelled the people from the forest. Some of the land, they say, has been used for planting trees. Some was given to rich people, and some of it lays idle.</p>
        <p>With no other choice, Mr. Karuku took up residence on the roadside.  His family of 14 has two shacks, one of them less than three feet from the road.</p>
        <p>''Now the people who became our leaders are behaving just like the white people,'' he said. ''They are still oppressing us.''</p>
