        <p>Midway through the second quarter of today's Raptors-Knicks game, Vince Carter's mother was telling NBC television about a note she gave him to put inside his sneakers. The message, Michelle Carter-Robinson said, mixed Scripture and her own basketball advice.</p>
        <p>''Trust in the Lord,'' she said, ''and go to the hole.''</p>
        <p>As if on cue, at that very moment, the young Raptor star soared toward the basket, took an alley-oop pass from Doug Christie and slammed down a two-handed dunk before hanging on the rim and waving his hand to celebrate. It gave Toronto a 1-point lead and seemed to suggest that this might be the Raptors' day and that they might avoid being swept in the first round of the National Basketball Association playoffs. Did Carter see it that way?</p>
        <p>''Not because of a dunk, no,'' Carter said. ''Too much emphasis put on the dunk nowadays, especially around me.''</p>
        <p>And perhaps there is too much emphasis put on Vince Carter, at least in the second season of what could be a great career. Hobbled by a slight ankle sprain today, Carter finished with 15 points on 5-for-17 shooting as the Raptors lost to the Knicks by 87-80. In three consecutive defeats, Carter made only 15 of 50 field-goal attempts.</p>
        <p>He said some of his shots had been disrupted by Patrick Ewing, the 37-year-old Knicks center. ''He might be an old guy, but he still can change a shot,'' Carter said. ''Couple times I got in there and he bumped me in the air and caused me to miss a couple easy layups.''</p>
        <p>And some found fault with Carter for passing instead of shooting when the Raptors had a chance to win in the final moments of Game 2 last Wednesday at Madison Square Garden. Projected as the heir to Michael Jordan as the N.B.A.'s next marquee attraction, Carter in the past week seemed to be the epitome of his team: not quite ready for the rarefied air of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Charles Oakley, the former Knick, described the Raptors' season as  ''more hype than what we're trying to accomplish as a team.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''We haven't done anything as a team. We're still building.''</p>
        <p>Worse than hype for Carter and others was the nasty exchange of words between Coach Butch Carter and several of his players last week. Among other things, the coach said his roster lacked leadership. He took Christie out of his starting role. Christie used the words ludicrous and dumb to describe the coach's comments. Dee Brown said the coach's remarks about player leadership were a cop-out. In that Butch Carter does not approve of headbands, Christie and Brown decided to wear black ones today.</p>
        <p>When asked about communication with his coach since the demotion, Christie replied: ''I haven't talked to him once. He hasn't said anything to me. What's expected of me, he needs to let me know so I can go out there and do it.'' Of the other distractions of this series, such as Butch Carter's brief lawsuit against Marcus Camby of the Knicks, Christie said: ''I don't think I'll remember this series for anything on the court. It'll be off the court that this series is remembered.''</p>
        <p>When Vince Carter was asked about Christie's comments this afternoon, his reaction was considerably different. ''That's a weak-minded person, in my mind, who gets distracted by that,'' he said, referring to players being hurt by off-court issues. ''The off-the-court stuff was left off the court. A lot of people were trying to put the problem in our heads.''</p>
        <p>As for what happened on the court, Oakley took the blame for a turnover with a minute left, when his pass for Brown went out of bounds. The Raptors could have tied or taken the lead on that play. ''I turned the ball over,'' Oakley said. ''It was my fault.''</p>
        <p>Tracy McGrady played with a sprained ankle, and that probably hindered his coverage of Allan Houston, who led the Knicks with 23 points. ''It was definitely tough,'' he said. ''I couldn't make any sharp cuts.''</p>
        <p>Butch Carter said it did not matter that the Raptors beat the Knicks three times in four games in the regular season. The intensity of the playoffs was totally different, as he could see on the videotapes. After the game, he wondered aloud if his team had ''the emotional stability'' for playoff intensity.</p>
        <p>But not everything was bitter in the aftermath of defeat for this fifth-year franchise after its first taste of the postseason. When Vince Carter left the floor after the game, he threw his shoes -- presumably after removing his mother's note -- to the fans as souvenirs.</p>
        <p>''End of the season, I don't need them,'' he said. ''Reality hit real quick. You say to yourself, 'You're not coming back out here to play basketball anymore this year.' ''</p>
        <p>McGrady, who is eligible to become an unrestricted free agent on July 1, raised his arms to salute the fans, some of whom carried signs urging him to stay.</p>
        <p>''It was just an acknowledgment to the crowd that it was a great season,'' McGrady said. ''It was just 'goodbye this year.' ''</p>
