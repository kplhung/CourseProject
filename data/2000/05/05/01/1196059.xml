        <p>There are orchestral programs you remember. To begin with, almost any concert that includes Edgard Varese's great beast of a work, ''Ameriques,'' the more so if it is strikingly contrasted or complemented.</p>

        <p>There are orchestral programs you remember. To begin with, almost any concert that includes Edgard Varese's great beast of a work, ''Ameriques,'' the more so if it is strikingly contrasted or complemented.</p>
        <p>Christoph von Dohnanyi and the Cleveland Orchestra, who have made a specialty of that work over a dozen years or so, unforgettably contrasted it with Mozart's ''Kleine Nachtmusik'' in 1991 at Tanglewood in Massachusetts. And on Friday evening at Carnegie Hall they held it up to a sort of distorting mirror, Charles Ives's Fourth Symphony.</p>
        <p>Here the telling contrast came in the orchestra's first program, on Thursday, which began with the hushed strings of Ives's ''Unanswered Question,'' a sound as intensely produced in its quietness as the final triumphant roar of ''Ameriques'' was in its loudness.</p>
        <p>The performances were tours de force, typical of Mr. Dohnanyi's time in Cleveland, which is winding down to its last two seasons. The quiet strings of ''The Unanswered Question,'' like the lonely protagonist, the splendid trumpet of Michael Sachs from the top balcony, seemed to be not so much playing in the hall as inhabiting it elementally, emanating from haunted walls, floor and ceiling.</p>
        <p>In ''Ameriques,'' on the other hand, the orchestra in its every instrument, down to siren and lion's roar, seemed to be cramming the hall with sound, testing the staying power of those same boundaries. A joke circulated to the effect that during a rehearsal on Friday morning construction workers who were rattling the foundations of Carnegie while excavating through granite for the new Zankel Hall had complained of noise from the orchestra.</p>
        <p>A performance of Beethoven's ''Eroica'' Symphony on Thursday was hardly less typical in the freshness Mr. Dohnanyi and the orchestra can still muster after 16 years together, even in the weariest warhorse. The funeral march proved especially gripping, as if in response to late-breaking tragedy, but there were fine touches everywhere: notably the deft, sonorous playing of the horns in the difficult and exposed trio of the scherzo.</p>
        <p>The other performances were also excellent. Bartok is another of Mr. Dohnanyi's particular strengths with the orchestra, as a meticulous yet wide-ranging account of the Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta showed on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Ives's Fourth Symphony, like ''Ameriques,'' concentrates a lusty, clangorous world of sound and color in a relatively small package, though with moments of redeeming social value, as in the lovely hymn tune of the Fugue. The Dessoff Symphonic Choir contributed well in the actual hymns of the outer movements, and Jahja Ling, the orchestra's resident conductor, ably assisted Mr. Dohnanyi in sorting out some of the work's boldly conflicting meters.</p>
        <p>Filling out the blockbuster program on Friday fell to John Adams's ''Century Rolls,'' a piano concerto from 1997 in its New York premiere, and it was a daunting task, as Mr. Adams noted in a preconcert discussion. In truth, despite a game and fiery reading of the solo part by Emanuel Ax, the work outstayed its modest potential for diversion and quickly grew predictable in its quirky unpredictability.</p>
        <p>Still, the only serious drawback of the concerts was the placement of the orchestra at the edge of the stage. On Friday crowding was inevitable, given the population explosion onstage, but on Thursday the forward placement seemed to be a choice of Mr. Dohnanyi, who has in recent years developed a feline curiosity about the acoustical effects of varied seating plans and stage setups to rival that of Stokowski.</p>
        <p>But at least since the renovation of Carnegie Hall in 1986, anything placed toward the front of the proscenium arch or outside it has tended to develop a reverberant haze. One such hovered over Mr. Ax's piano, as typically happens with solo instruments placed so far forward.</p>
        <p>Worse, a kind of acoustical scrim formed at the front of the orchestral strings in both the Bartok and the Beethoven, blurring the fine edge in attacks and pizzicatos that is so characteristic of this most refined orchestra. Curiosity may not have killed anything here, but it wounded some otherwise elegant creations.</p>
