        <p>Yesterday morning at the Convent Avenue Baptist Church, the Rev. Clarence Harding urged his congregation members to put their emotional well-being into the Lord's hands.</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, a social worker told church members that if that didn't work, they might try Zoloft.</p>
        <p>Like most other Sunday mornings at the Harlem church, the pews were packed with men in sharp suits and women in stylish dresses and colorful wide-brimmed hats. Many fanned themselves or waved their hands as the choir sang ''At the Cross'' and Mr. Harding preached that despair can be cured by ''accepting God's promise.''</p>
        <p>But then Dr. David Nganele, whose company runs a monthly health clinic at the church, urged members of the congregation who ''feel anxious over Lent'' to stick around for a mental health seminar with ''the folks from Pfizer.''</p>
        <p>About 100 people stayed in their pews after the service for the session. Then the white-gloved ushers  were replaced by Pfizer employees, who dispensed promotional pens, information on antidepressant drugs, including Zoloft, and Pfizer videos about depression.</p>
        <p>Since November, Harmony Health Communications, a program trying to introduce health care awareness and health corporations to the Harlem community, has run monthly medical screenings, checkups and consultations at the church. But the group touched a nerve in the congregation yesterday when it broached the topic of mental health, suggesting antidepressant medication if prayer fails to smooth life's trials.</p>
        <p>While some people were still buzzing about Mr. Harding's sermon, Jacqueline A. Sawyer told church members that ''Jesus is the answer, but you may also need help.''</p>
        <p>Pamela Hicks, the social worker, from North General Hospital in Harlem, stood at the front of the church and invited members of the congregation to an ''anxiety screening'' at the hospital and even to receive free samples of medication there.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hicks preached the benefits of Zoloft and other antidepressant medication in balancing one's emotions to enrich one's spiritual life.</p>
        <p>''If I don't take care of my temple, it may be hard to hear what the Holy Spirit has to say,'' said Ms. Hicks.  But the Rev. Kei Okada, an associate minister at the church, stood and disagreed. ''Power comes from God,'' he said, drawing applause and shouts of support from many attendees. ''You must surrender and ask his help.''</p>
        <p>''God may not have a predictable cause and effect like drugs do, but that doesn't mean you tell a congregation that as soon as the Lord's power doesn't work, Prozac will,'' Mr. Okada said.</p>
        <p>But, Ms. Hicks said, medication can be helpful for ''life in urban America, which is sometimes living in a combat zone.''</p>
        <p>''I wonder what Dr. King would say about these things if he were alive today,'' she said.</p>
        <p>One church member asked Ms. Hicks why she could only sleep for three hours at a time. Another member stood and admitted to taking Prozac.</p>
        <p>Many in the crowd tittered when Christine Dixon, one of the church's premier choir soloists, stood and said her depression caused hyperactivity and procrastination.</p>
        <p>''I've taken both lithium and Prozac,'' she said, ''and it just made me more nervous.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Nganele's clinic offers a different health service each month after Sunday services. Other seminars have focused on blood pressure, overweight and asthma.</p>
        <p>''Mental health is something taboo, yet because we are in their house, they open up and discuss it more freely,'' said Dr. Nganele.</p>
