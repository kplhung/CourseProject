        <p>Barbie is running for president, and I'm supposed to feel great about it. Mattel has teamed up with two women's groups to create a Barbie for President 2000, complete with a Girls' Bill of Rights, a blue suit, pearls and high heels. This doll, the press release says, is supposed to ''broaden girls' vision of what's possible.''</p>
        <p>Well, I spent 24 years in Congress fighting to improve the status of women, to have us viewed as full citizens. Now I feel as though I've lost the fight. What is the ''Barbie for President'' message? I'm afraid that it's ''You can be president if you're a 10!''</p>

        <p>Barbie is running for president, and I'm supposed to feel great about it. Mattel has teamed up with two women's groups to create a Barbie for President 2000, complete with a Girls' Bill of Rights, a blue suit, pearls and high heels. This doll, the press release says, is supposed to ''broaden girls' vision of what's possible.''</p>
        <p>Well, I spent 24 years in Congress fighting to improve the status of women, to have us viewed as full citizens. Now I feel as though I've lost the fight. What is the ''Barbie for President'' message? I'm afraid that it's ''You can be president if you're a 10!''</p>
        <p>Gloria Steinem says that an easy way to detect sexism is to reverse the roles. Let's do the switch. In our scenario, no man in history has ever occupied the Oval Office, and a popular toy among young boys is the Leonardo DiCaprio doll, which comes with a lot of great outfits. Along comes the newest Leo doll: same body, but this time, he's president! This gives a huge boost to boys' morale everywhere. They can dream that one day they, too, can win the White House, but only if they look like Leo!</p>
        <p>Let's get back to the real world. Portraits of past presidents tell us that being a hunk is definitely not a job requirement. So why should we feel great about a message that says a woman can go to the White House if she looks like Barbie?</p>
        <p>During my years in public office, one issue I got the most mail about was my hair, with questions like, ''How do you wear your hair when you're dressed up?'' I was urged to dye my hair, and people even enclosed checks to pay for a makeover. In no audience I've ever spoken to have I found a man who sent Al Gore a check for Rogaine or asked Newt Gingrich to get a haircut. I would have hoped that we could have erased such differences by the dawn of the 21st century. But now, it seems, the only way to imagine a woman in the White House is to put Barbie there. I'm sorry, but I just can't get enthusiastic. I can see my hero, Eleanor Roosevelt, sitting in heaven, shaking her head and saying, ''They still don't get it!''</p>
