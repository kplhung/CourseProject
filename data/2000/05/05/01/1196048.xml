        <p>There could be much argument about which country has the world's best players. The last three world open team titles have been won by France, Italy and the United States. But there is no argument that the Netherlands is the organizing capital of the bridge world, repeatedly delivering brilliant planning and execution.</p>

        <p>In August the Dutch will stage the World Team Championships in Maastricht. In March they presented the Cap Gemini World Top Pairs. In February they were hosts to another prestigious event, the Forbo Teams. And in January they assembled junior teams representing 25 countries for the Eighth International Hero Youth Bridge Festival.</p>
        <p>The junior winners were Norway, ahead of the United States, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden, in that order. An English player, Richard Probst, judged well in making four spades on the diagramed deal from a match against Hungary. The opening bid was a weak no-trump, showing 12-14 points, and the overcall of two spades showed spades and a minor, a popular method on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>The defense took two club tricks, and East shifted to a trump. South played low, and when West produced the queen it was clear that East must have all the missing high cards to justify his opening bid. A trump return was won with dummy's jack, and the heart jack was led. A normal finesse was sure to fail, so the backward variety was indicated.</p>
        <p>East covered promptly with the queen, and South played the king. Now South had to solve the problem of the heart 10. After drawing the remaining trump, he led to the heart ace and reached this position:</p>
        <p>Diagram</p>
        <p>Probst judged that East's earlier play of the heart queen was automatic if he held the 10, but less than automatic if he did not. So he led the heart eight and discarded a diamond when East played low. Then he ruffed a heart and claimed his game.</p>
        <p>This gained nothing, for in the replay East made a disastrous shift to a heart at the third trick. But it avoided a loss.</p>
