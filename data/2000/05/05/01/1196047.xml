        <p>Finding that consumers crave the heft of print, Web sites have recently begun publishing print versions. Yahoo Internet Life and eBay magazine may have helped pave the way, but last month Ziff-Davis announced that it would begin publishing a travel magazine based on the Expedia Web site, and Space.com announced plans for Space, a print magazine.</p>
        <p>And this month, Knot, which operates a wedding Web site, published The Knot Wedding Gowns, the first issue of a magazine devoted to bridal wear. (The company recently bought Wedding Pages, the largest publisher of regional wedding magazines.)</p>
        <p>''Our mission is to redefine the wedding industry,'' said David Liu, chief executive of Knot. ''And to do that, you have to be wherever the consumer is looking for information.''</p>
        <p>April also brought Nerve, a print version of Nerve.com's site, best described as a combination of art, literature and explicit nude photography.</p>
        <p>Rufus Griscom, the co-publisher of Nerve, said that it would have been a missed opportunity not to print a magazine. ''By building the Web site first, we created an audience of 800,000 readers who want to see this magazine,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Is there another reason? ''I don't read online,'' Mr. Griscom said.</p>
