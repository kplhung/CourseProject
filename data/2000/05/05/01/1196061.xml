        <p>The anchor for the nightly German news program ''Heute-Journal,'' Alexander Niemetz, once described himself as a practitioner of ''classic American journalism'' who always kept an objective distance from his subject.</p>
        <p>But the last two weeks, Mr. Niemetz has been at the center of a renewed debate about the blurry boundaries in Germany between journalists and their outside money-making practices.</p>
        <p>ZDF, one of Germany's publicly owned national television networks, suspended Mr. Niemetz two weeks ago after an industry magazine published details of a fax to Mr. Niemetz from a public relations agency. In the fax, the publicity agency thanked Mr. Niemetz for sending it material about a small medical company and suggested that Mr. Niemetz should contact a record company for ''some more ideas'' for stories about Melissa Etheridge, the American singer.</p>
        <p>Last Tuesday, ZDF accepted Mr. Niemetz's explanation that he had never accepted any money from the agency or allowed it to influence the program. But the network did rebuke Mr. Niemetz for taking other side jobs, including paid appearances for the German railway and the carmaker Opel.</p>
        <p>Those disclosures, in turn, have refocused attention on the common practice of reputable German television journalists taking part in paid corporate promotions -- and sometimes even advertising. The issue has arisen regularly the last five years, and it has sharply divided journalists without being resolved.</p>
        <p>Five years ago, one of Germany's most celebrated television anchors, Ulrich Wickert, was harshly criticized after he took the starring role in a video promoting the German insurance company Deutsche Herold. Mr. Wickert, who still is the anchor of the nightly news program ''Tagesthemen'' on the ARD television network, quickly apologized and agreed to donate the money he had been paid -- reportedly about 50,000 marks, or $33,000 -- to a charity.</p>
        <p>In the wake of that uproar, Mr. Wickert publicly endorsed a new honor code proposed by the German Association of Journalists, under which journalists would voluntarily refuse to make advertisements.</p>
        <p>But that did not stop the promotional work of numerous prominent journalists. In 1996, Nina Ruge, the anchor of another ZDF news program, ''Heute Leute'' (''People Today''), featured the chairman of Daimler-Benz, Jurgen E. Schrempp, on her show just after she had been M.C. at a Daimler gala for which she was paid about $20,000. Ms. Ruge had also starred in a promotional video for Ruhrgas, a natural gas distributor.</p>
        <p>In 1998, the head of sports reporting for ZDF was featured in an advertising campaign for investments; his face adorned posters at about 3,500 savings banks.</p>
        <p>''These cases are an expression of underdeveloped journalistic  ethics,'' said Siegfried Weischenberg, chairman of the German Association of Journalists in Hamburg. ''The lines between journalism and outside activities here are not nearly as clear as they are in the United States.''</p>
        <p>Such comparisons are not entirely straightforward. Well-known American journalists, including television reporters and newspaper columnists, have made huge sums giving speeches -- sometimes to industry groups.</p>
        <p>One big difference is the pay scale. The anchors for publicly owned television networks in Germany typically make about 300,000 marks a year -- about $150,000. Their American counterparts routinely make several times that much.</p>
        <p>''Television anchors are often famous people, and their prominence increases the number of offers and the number of temptations,'' Mr. Weischenberg said. Though anchors are hardly poor, they are far from rich, either.  The money from outside work can easily exceed their regular income.</p>
        <p>The blurry boundaries are not limited to television journalism. Germany's smaller newspapers often rely on freelance writers for as much as half of their writing and much of their editing, and magazines rely even more heavily on them. Because freelance writers and editors are paid far less than are full-time reporters and editors, many rely on public relations work and writing speeches to supplement their incomes.</p>
        <p>Many German publications also let corporations pay the travel and hotel expenses of reporters who cover their annual meetings and news conferences.</p>
        <p>Journalists here remain divided about where to draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable relationships with corporations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Niemetz, of ZDF, would have generated little if any controversy if he had simply earned money from appearances at corporate events. What attracted attention was the impression, which could not be proved, that he worked with a public relations agency while purporting to be an independent journalist.</p>
        <p>Mr. Niemetz adamantly denied doing any such work, and ZDF officials said last week that the network had found no substantive reason not to believe him. Though the faxed letter from the public relations agency hinted at a close relationship, it offered no proof.</p>
        <p>Nor did ZDF criticize Mr. Niemetz for doing work on behalf of outside companies like the German railway. It merely said that Mr. Niemetz had violated its rules by failing to receive the network's permission before he took on several jobs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Niemetz is scheduled to resume work this week.</p>
