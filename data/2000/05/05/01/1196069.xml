        <p>The French advertising company Publicis S.A. is close to reaching an agreement to acquire Young &amp; Rubicam, one of the last independent advertising companies, for about $5 billion, executives close to the talks said today.</p>
        <p>The move comes after separate talks about a possible merger between Y.&amp; R., of New York, and a British advertising conglomerate, the WPP Group P.L.C., broke down on Friday evening following several last-minute changes made to the merger proposal document by both sides and a terse trans-Atlantic phone call between negotiators.</p>
        <p>Young &amp; Rubicam's chief executive, Thomas Bell, had been conducting merger discussions with WPP and Publicis simultaneously, executives close to the talks said.</p>
        <p>Once it was no longer the potential prize in a bidding war, Y.&amp; R. held a conference call this afternoon with Publicis in an effort to forge a merger agreement, the executives said. If the two companies do agree to merge, which could happen as early as the end of the week, the deal would create the fourth-largest advertising company in the world, right behind WPP, which owns Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, J. Walter Thompson and the public relations firm Hill &amp; Knowlton.</p>
        <p>Though WPP was prepared to pay about $65 a share for Young &amp; Rubicam in a stock swap, executives close to the talks said Publicis might be able to buy the agency for less -- between $60 and $65 a share -- now that it is Y.&amp; R.'s only suitor.</p>
        <p>The executives cautioned that just as negotiations broke down between WPP and Y.&amp; R., the talks with Publicis could still fall apart at the last minute. Indeed, Young &amp; Rubicam and Publicis could have a major client conflict since Young &amp; Rubicam's big client is Ford and Publicis works for Renault.</p>
        <p>This is the second time that WPP and Y.&amp; R. came close to an agreement, only to have the talks fail. Negotiations to merge began four months ago, but Mr. Bell called them off in March because of a dispute over compensation issues. Two weeks ago, WPP's chief executive, Sir Martin Sorrell, reignited the discussions.</p>
        <p>Executives at both agencies declined to comment on that and other matters yesterday.</p>
        <p>This time around, though, the negotiations are somewhat clouded by a souring relationship between Mr. Bell and Sir Martin stemming from the first breakdown in talks, according to several participants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell created more resentment among WPP's top brass by appearing to hold talks with other suitors. In addition to Publicis, Y.&amp; R. put out feelers to other agencies like Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Worldwide P.L.C., according to executives close to Y.&amp; R. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi has said that Young &amp; Rubicam never approached it. In addition, Y.&amp; R. held discussions with the direct marketer and publisher Harte-Hanks about buying that company, according to executives close to the talks. Those talks are continuing, executives close to Young &amp; Rubicam said, though a deal is not expected to be made final until Y.&amp; R.'s future is more certain.</p>
        <p>WPP executives also charge that Mr. Bell changed important elements of the proposed agreement at the last minute.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Sir Martin was creating nonadmirers at Y.&amp; R. Executives close to that agency said one minute he was agreeing to certain terms of the draft agreement and the next minute he would change his mind.</p>
        <p>Executives from both companies have conflicting versions of how the talks between Young &amp; Rubicam and WPP went bad. Executives of WPP believed that the deal was to be completed by Friday, after Y.&amp; R. had set that day as the deadline. Indeed, WPP executives said they were under the impression that Y.&amp; R. had agreed to the price and specific terms of the deal.</p>
        <p>But Y.&amp; R. executives said that when they received a copy of the draft merger documents on Thursday, several of the provisions that they thought had been agreed to were changed or eliminated. They also said there had been no final agreement on price.</p>
        <p>The issues in contention involved Young &amp; Rubicam's ability to work autonomously within WPP. Mr. Bell was going to be chairman of the enlarged WPP, and Young &amp; Rubicam also wanted Mike Dolan, Y.&amp; R.'s finance director, to be president of the Y.&amp; R. group within WPP with complete control of the group for the first year of the merger. But Sir Martin objected to Mr. Dolan's plan for complete autonomy.</p>
        <p>There were also disagreements over top executives' employment contracts. Young &amp; Rubicam wanted a provision that would allow its top employees to leave the company without losing stock options or other benefits if WPP interfered with Y.&amp; R. business during the first year of the merger. It also objected to certain noncompetition provisions for employees sought by Sir Martin.</p>
        <p>In the end, Young &amp; Rubicam faxed the 200-page document back to WPP on Friday evening, adding the set of provisions that it believed had been agreed to.</p>
        <p>Executives at WPP said the provisions were entirely new demands. The last-minute trans-Atlantic call sealed the fate of the deal: neither party argued when the other said the merger was off.</p>
