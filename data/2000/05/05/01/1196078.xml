        <p>In the government's proposal to break up Microsoft and set new ground rules for its business practices, the beneficiaries are supposed to include other software companies -- especially the little guys.</p>
        <p>But so far, reaction to the government's proposed helping hand seems muted, or outright skeptical, among software developers -- the primarily small and midsized companies that create a variety of products that make computers work faster or more easily, or that act as tools used by other programmers.</p>
        <p>Why so little rejoicing?</p>
        <p>Some developers view the plan the Justice Department and 17 states filed last Friday as too backward looking, aimed at a personal computer software industry the Internet is already passing by. And some of these same developers and others predict Microsoft, even split in two, will remain too mighty a force to counter.</p>
        <p>''Microsoft is the ocean,'' said Mark Eppley, a veteran software industry executive who is president at Laplink Inc., a maker of software that enables users to synchronize the files on their desktop and portable computers. ''Even if you divide it into Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, I still have to swim in it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Eppley's company is an example of one that has been able to continue to compete, even though Microsoft offers a similar utility program called ''the briefcase'' as a free part of the Windows 98 and 2000 operating systems. Laplink, based in Bothell, Wash., has been able to survive by offering more features than are available through Microsoft's briefcase.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eppley noted that Laplink, like most other companies in the software business, was now moving its products rapidly to Internet versions. And said he hoped that Microsoft would not develop its own Internet formats for storing and retrieving files -- because unified or divided, Microsoft would present a formidable competitor.</p>
        <p>Executives at some other small companies still focused on the traditional personal computer software business said they did not see how a Microsoft breakup would create new possibilities for them.</p>
        <p>''It is is not obvious where the opportunity would occur if a breakup were to occur,'' Lawrence A. Zulch, chief executive officer of the Dantz Development Corporation, a company in Orinda, Calif., whose software is used for making back-up copies of personal computer data and files. ''We don't see a logical fracture line that wouldn't turn into a dominant company that would overtake the other one and create a new Microsoft. So it's not clear how it would help the personal computer industry and, therefore, us.''</p>
        <p>By proposing to separate Microsoft's Windows operating system business from its Office applications software business, the government hopes to unleash personal computer makers to pursue new business strategies and relationships that Microsoft has opposed. The government would also be counting on the breakup to re-ignite the kind of brush fire of innovation in the personal computer software industry that flourished in the early days of the PC in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>By the early 1990's, Microsoft had pretty well won the war for operating systems -- the software that controls the basic operations of a computer. But before Microsoft's Office suite of desktop personal computer applications became the de facto industry standard, the industry was awash with small and medium-size software publishing firms developing hundreds of different kinds of competing application programs. These applications ranged from word processors, databases and spreadsheets to programs used for enabling PC's to communicate and utility programs for helping PC's work better.</p>
        <p>But since the mid-90's, with Office dominating applications, new investment in the software industry has largely flowed instead to products for the Internet. The traditional software industry has languished, with even name-brand products like Wordperfect changing corporate owners, while many other companies merged or went out of business and the survivors scrambled for niches that gave some shelter from competition's risks.</p>
        <p>In interviews, many -- though not all -- industry executives who discussed the government's plan for Microsoft said they were skeptical that slicing off Microsoft's application business would create a meaningful resurgence in applications software. Besides predicting that the spun-off company would continue to dominate PC applications, many executives argued that there were simply no longer enough opportunities for growth in the traditional applications field.</p>
        <p>''Taking Office and Windows apart doesn't seem to prepare for the future,'' said William Gurley, a venture capitalist at Benchmark Capital in Menlo Park, Calif. ''The majority of new innovation and spending isn't going into desktop. It feels like that game is over.''</p>
        <p>Still, some industry executives who have battled Microsoft for years said they could now envision new designs for software products that might not have been viable in a Microsoft-dominated world.</p>
        <p>''We won't be selling packaged software the way we did in the 1980's,'' said Mitchell D. Kapor. He was founder of the Lotus Development Corporation, a company that was once a leader in spreadsheets and other applications. But after the Microsoft Office onslaught, Lotus sought refuge by selling itself to I.B.M. in 1995.</p>
        <p>''Now it's worthwhile conducting some experiments in new kinds of application architectures,'' said Mr. Kapor, who is now an investor and venture capitalist. ''If the applications aren't linked to the operating system, there are some real possibilities for innovation.'' But he declined to be specific, for competitive reasons.</p>
        <p>Some other software designers said that it would be almost impossible to predict the consequences of the splitting of Microsoft -- and that unintended consequences might surprise the industry and the Justice Department.</p>
        <p>''We really don't know what these things will do; it's hard to debug remedies,'' said Daniel S. Bricklin, who was co-inventor of the software spreadsheet and is now co-founder of the Trellix Corporation. Trellix, based in Concord, Mass., publishes an application software program that helps users create documents suited for reading on the World Wide Web, rather than being printed out.</p>
        <p>One example of an unintended consequence of the government's antitrust case may already be taking place, in the view of Hal Varian, an economist who is dean of the School of Information Management &amp; Systems at the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
        <p>Mr. Varian said that the Justice Department is hoping that a newly spun-off applications company would make a copy of Microsoft Office available for use with Linux. He was referring to the Linux operating system, which many Microsoft denigrators hope can be a viable alternative to Windows. ''But because of Microsoft's monopoly,'' he said, ''Sun Microsystems recently began giving away a free copy of Star Office for Linux.''</p>
        <p>By offering its own free alternative to Microsoft Office, Mr. Varian said, Sun might discourage any new Microsoft spin-off from trying to compete in the Linux market. That, presumably, would not be the kind of competitive response the government would hope for with a Microsoft breakup.</p>
        <p>Yet, several executives in the Linux community said they hoped that a Microsoft spinoff would create versions of its applications for Linux, making the free operating system much more attractive to non-technical computer users. So far, Linux has tended to be an operating system only a geek could love.</p>
        <p>''If Microsoft shows up on Linux, everything would change; it would be a big enabler for Linux,'' said Michael Boiche, cofounder and chief executive of Eazel, a company designing software intended to make Linux easier to use.</p>
        <p>One formerly competitive sector of the computer industry that appears to have been overlooked by the government proposal is programming languages, a field that Microsoft also dominates.</p>
        <p>Programming languages like C, C++, Basic and Java are used by software developers to build desktop computer applications like word processors and Web browsers. But they are also used for creating network applications like Web-searching programs that reside on network server computers and are queried by multiple people using individual Web-browser programs.</p>
        <p>Development tools are any variety of software programs that help software programmers do their jobs. And just as in automotive repair, it matters whether a mechanic's tools are based on the metric system or gauged in fractions of inches, so do programming languages govern the basis for software tools.</p>
        <p>The government proposal would place Microsoft's development tools business within the new applications company. But several executives said that not enough attention had been paid to the importance of programming languages in giving Microsoft a commercial and technical advantage. Microsoft's Visual Basic program is but one of several of the company's development tools that help it dominate this part of the software world.</p>
        <p>Software developers say that Microsoft's vast influence in programming languages not only gives the company special advantages in developing applications; it also tends to bind outside developers to Microsoft's operating systems and applications programs.</p>
        <p>''The tools business doesn't seem important to people, but it's really very important,'' said one industry executive, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. ''If there is no vibrant tools business than there is no applications business.''</p>
