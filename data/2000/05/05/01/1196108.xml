        <p>Jerry Bailey drove his car straight to Barn 41 at Churchill Downs, where the trainer Neil Drysdale was still talking about his $4 million colt, Fusaichi Pegasus, the favorite in the 126th Kentucky Derby. Kent Desormeaux will be the jockey, with Bailey scheduled aboard the superstar's stablemate, War Chant. But Bailey bounced up with all the mischief of a man who knew the odds and asked Drysdale, ''How is my horse doing?'' with the emphasis on ''my.''</p>
        <p>Drysdale said War Chant was doing fine, but then even Bailey joined the conversation about Fusaichi Pegasus, the talk of the town and the 3-year-old widely considered the most likely in years to break the jinx of the Derby on Saturday: no favorite has won America's most prestigious horserace in 20 years, not since Spectacular Bid in 1979.</p>
        <p>But neither Bailey nor Drysdale blinked on Saturday when they were told that if their horses finish first and second in the Derby, they would achieve a notable sweep. No stable has run first and second in the Derby since 1948, when the trainers Ben and Jimmy Jones finished 1-2 with Citation and Coaltown for Calumet Farm.</p>
        <p>Bailey, the nation's premier jockey, was particularly interested in the frisky temperament that has marked Fusaichi Pegasus in his five races and frequent workouts. He tossed his rider last Thursday morning after finishing his exercise and fell over on his rump. But Drysdale, standing nearby, leapt in and grabbed the reins before Fusaichi Pegasus could damage his valuable body or his standing as the solid early choice for the Derby.</p>
        <p>''Congratulations on your quick hands,'' Bailey said with a laugh. And Drysdale replied with a laugh, ''I didn't want to see him go cantering off into the sunset.''</p>
        <p>Drysdale, speaking with his English sense of understatement and not allowing temperament to become an issue, added: ''The horse is frisky, rather like his grandmother. But he's happy; he's not high-strung.''</p>
        <p>Fusaichi Pegasus certainly behaved early this morning when Drysdale sent him off before dawn for his final workout: six furlongs in 1:143/5 . The trainer said his star did exactly the right things, and he called the workout standard. One of Fusaichi Pegasus' chief rivals, High Yield, trained by D. Wayne Lukas, worked the same distance one second faster, but their true test was still six days off.</p>
        <p>Drysdale's powerful pair will most likely lead a full field of 20 horses on Saturday as they enter the starting gates for the Derby, with its $1 million purse and its guarantee of enshrining the winner with the ultimate celebrity status in racing and breeding.</p>
        <p>Whoever wins the Derby will become the only horse with a shot at the Triple Crown, a feat that has not been completed since Affirmed did it in 1978. And he was only the 11th horse to do it.</p>
        <p>Storybook drama was not quite realized in the last three years when the Derby winners -- Silver Charm, Real Quiet and Charismatic -- also won the Preakness but missed their sweeps when they lost the Belmont.</p>
        <p>The Derby has grown in size as well as in drama. Five of the six largest crowds jammed Churchill Downs in the last five years, reaching a recent peak last year with 151,051. The record crowd was counted in 1974, when 163,628 watched the 100th Derby.</p>
        <p>So, who is the horse being touted as almost a sure shot to capture the mile-and-a-quarter distance and the fame that goes with it?</p>
        <p>Fusaichi Pegasus is his name, bestowed by the Japanese venture capitalist Fusai Sekiguchi, who paid $4 million to buy him as a yearling at the July sale at Keeneland in Lexington. The first name derives from the first four letters of the owner's name -- Fusa -- plus the Japanese word ichi, meaning No. 1 or the best. Pegasus is the flying horse of mythology. The first part of the name is pronounced foo-sah-eech-ee, although Drysdale fuses the parts into ''Fusachi.''</p>
        <p>''Around the barn,'' Drysdale said, ''I call him simply the colt.''</p>
        <p>Sekiguchi, who heads the venture-capital company Venture Safenet in Tokyo, does not speak English but made it known that he would have gone to $5 million to buy the powerfully built bay son of Mr. Prospector and the Danzig mare Angel Fever. They endowed Fusaichi Pegasus with regal breeding and a large, handsome body that glows. John Ward represented Sekiguchi in the sale, quoting him as saying:</p>
        <p>''This was the only horse that we were interested in. My first impression when I saw him was an inspiration.''</p>
        <p>Sekiguchi has owned horses for 20 years, mostly in Japan, and often gives them the first name Fusaichi. His horse Fusaichi Concorde won the Epsom Derby in 1995. Drysdale met Sekiguchi only three times but expects to see him next week when he arrives for the Derby with his daughter, who is fluent in English.</p>
        <p>''They're due here maybe Tuesday,'' Drysdale said. ''When Fusa ichi Pegasus was winning the Wood Memorial in New York two weeks ago, his daughter was on the phone to Tokyo, where it was about 5 in the morning, giving him a play by play.''</p>
        <p>The Wood was the colt's fourth victory in a row this year. His only loss came in his debut last December, when David Copperfield edged him by a neck at Hollywood Park. It was his only race as a 2-year-old, Drysdale said, because ''he is a big horse, so he was given time to allow his legs to strengthen.''</p>
        <p>The 126th Derby comes with plenty of story lines: Jenine Sahadi trying to become the first female trainer to win the race with her horse, The Deputy; Todd Pletcher entering four colts in his first Derby; the 88-year-old Harold Rose, the breeder, owner and trainer of Hal's Hope, winner of the Florida Derby; and the celebrated trainers Lukas and Bob Baffert, who have dominated the Derby in recent years, Lukas winning in 1995, 1996 and 1999, and Baffert winning in 1997 and 1998.</p>
        <p>And the $4 million prodigy, Fusa ichi Pegasus, the flying favorite.</p>
        <p>''Fusaichi Pegasus is everybody's favorite, everybody's horse to beat,'' Pletcher said. ''He's proved it on both coasts. But if he stubs his toe, you hope you can take advantage.''</p>
        <p>Drysdale, trying to manage the furor around Barn 41 as the big day nears, said he got the word that he was named the horse's trainer in a telephone call early last year. He knew all about the high-spirited $4 million star and where he was going.</p>
        <p>''It was a challenge,'' Drysdale said, retreating once more into understatement. ''He's got power.''</p>
