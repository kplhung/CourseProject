        <p>Imagine it's 60 or 70 years from now and you've arrived for the Woody Allen retrospective at the local art cinema. The theater darkens, and you're ready for a good giggle out of the past, but what comes on the screen is not ''Bananas'' or ''Annie Hall,'' but ''Interiors'' or ''September'' or another of Mr. Allen's Bergmanesque experiments in seriousness that will surely go down as footnotes in the career of an important comic auteur.</p>
        <p>Such is the experience of watching ''Hotel Universe,'' a play that was written in 1929 with the same concern for dissecting the American privileged class that the author, Philip Barry, displayed in his most famous works, ''The Philadelphia Story'' and ''Holiday,'' but without the comic bent and sophisticated wit that made them last.</p>
        <p>The play, at the McGinn/Cazale Theater on the Upper West Side, is about an evening spent by several American travelers in the South of France, on a veranda that becomes a kind of purgatory where each character gets to dance with, and ultimately expiate, his or her psychic demons.</p>
        <p>Borrowing a setting and a citizenry from Fitzgerald, a spirit of self-seriousness from Hemingway and a belief in the subconscious from Freud (one character actually reveals her libidinous desires while sleepwalking), the play is, by turns, ponderous and melodramatic, certainly a curious choice for resurrection. But it is nonetheless being given a polished and enthusiastic production by the Blue Light Theater Company.</p>
        <p>And under the direction of Darko Tresnjak, a hard-working, mostly young and very attractive cast gives off the pleasing sense of being happily engaged in an eccentric folly.</p>
        <p>Barry, who died in 1949, was awfully good at showing that, contrary to Fitzgerald's famous axiom, the rich don't have to be different from you and me. In ''Holiday'' and ''The Philadelphia Story,'' both of which have, of course, been handed to posterity in terrific movies starring Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, wealth was not a determinant of character, merely an obstacle to good behavior. It was animation of spirit that Barry celebrated in those plays; if you had it, you deserved romance and happiness. If not, you deserved a bland existence circumscribed by societal expectation.</p>
        <p>The same idea is operating in ''Hotel Universe,'' but for these characters it isn't their affluence that impedes them. And they have more at stake than a satisfying love match. They're not filthy rich, like Hepburn's Tracy Lord in ''The Philadelphia Story,'' just well fixed enough to be presumptuous. And their problems have psychological implications. For one thing, most have arrived at this house having just witnessed the impetuous suicide of a young man who dived off a cliff; the play opens with intimations of mortality and proceeds to illustrate and unravel the emotional knots of the assembled friends.</p>
        <p>The beautiful Mediterranean-style set is by David P. Gordon, done in wicker and peach with an azure background and a black tile floor appropriate for waltzing with demons. Barry imagined his setting as the house of Sara and Gerald Murphy, the friends of Fitzgerald whose Riviera estate was a setting for  ''Tender Is the Night.'' In the play it is a former hotel of mysteriously legendary repute that is now being rented by Ann Field (Arija Bareikis), who is caring for her ill father (Richard Easton) and living in the torment of a lost love. He, of course, is one of her guests, Pat Farley (Adam Stein), who is himself in torment over the suicide of the girl he left after he left Ann.</p>
        <p>Also present are Tom and Hope Ames (Liam Craig, Keira Naughton), a married couple in the throes of Tom's midlife ennui; Lily Malone (Kali Rocha), an actress who could never please her actor father and who thus wants nothing more than to play Cordelia; Norman Rose (Armand Schultz), a bachelor businessman; and Alice Kendall (Cheryl Lynn Bowers), a lonely flapper with an ache, confessed in dreams, for Norman.</p>
        <p>That everyone in this menagerie ends up happy is silly, but the working out of all the problems -- in flashback scenes, dream sequences and ongoing discussions -- has its fascinations. Mainly it's that the familiar psychological themes -- a childhood's lingering influence on an adult, the damage of gnawing guilt, midlife angst -- seem so interestingly primitive here. These are the yuppies of their day, and they have yuppie problems. They could certainly use some of the good-natured humor that Barry gives to the much more likable folks in his comedies.</p>
        <p>In the mouths of these actors, who seem terribly young and too contemporarily jaded to be saying things like ''But I want to see your face. I'm fond of your lean, brown face,'' the hyperbolically romantic language of the playwright, also borrowed from Fitzgerald, ends up feeling a little thin. (For a sense of how language like this should be sold, rent the movies; nobody could gush like Ms. Hepburn.)</p>
        <p>But otherwise they convey, with utterly earnest conviction, the passion of self-involved and privileged people who feel their lives are being wasted and that the goodness in them has yet to be vigorously pursued.</p>
        <p>This is a very ardent, sexy ensemble, all of whom are dressed in snazzy clothes (the costumes are by Linda Cho), and the director, Mr. Tresnjak, has gone out of his way to paint gorgeous stage pictures with them. Everybody involved in this production seems to be unusually engaged. And as a result, they make this dated play fun to watch.</p>
