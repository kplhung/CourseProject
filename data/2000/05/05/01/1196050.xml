        <p>A survey provides more evidence -- as if more were needed -- that the same people who plunk down 50 cents for a newspaper and $3.50 for a news magazine will not pay for news on the Internet.</p>
        <p>The survey by Princeton Research Associates for the Web content distributor ScreamingMedia.com, found that 89 percent of the 1,232 respondents had never paid for news or information on the Web, and 83 percent were not willing to pay.</p>
        <p>Already, the market has demonstrated that Internet audiences tend to expect free news. Other than the subscription-based site of The Wall Street Journal (wsj.com), few news organizations have been able to sustain a pure subscription model on the Web.</p>
        <p>The speed of news updates seemed to be a big draw. Some 85 percent said they would return to a site whose news was frequently updated, and 83 percent said they would go back more often to sites with news not available elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Executives of Screamingmedia say the survey shows that information is valued not only for itself but also for the speed with which it is delivered and context.</p>
        <p>The results seem to fit its business model. ''I was dancing in the aisles when I saw it,'' said Kevin C. Clark, chief executive of Screamingmedia, which aggregates everything from news and entertainment in print, video and audio formats and distributes it.</p>
