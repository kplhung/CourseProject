        <p>The clock struck 11 and Jenny Oldfield began the highly unpleasant but legally necessary ritual of kicking the customers out of her pub.</p>
        <p>As she flashed the lights on and off in the universal ''last orders'' signal, Mark Mulligan, 32, seized his beer from the bar and began to drain it with the pleasure-free determination of a condemned man consuming his last meal.</p>
        <p>''Why should we have to stop drinking,'' he said, ''just because somebody says we do?''</p>
        <p>The somebody in question is not Ms. Oldfield, the reluctant enforcer at the Old Wellington Inn in Shambles Square, but the British government. Since World War I, when it restricted pub hours to prevent munitions workers from getting drunk, using poor judgment on the assembly line and blowing up arms factories, Parliament has kept tight control of its citizens' drinking.</p>
        <p>The regulations are complicated and deeply confusing, but the best known and most reviled is the law that requires the country's 60,000 pubs to close at 11 p.m. six days a week, and at 10:30 on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Now, more than 80 years later, it looks as if change is at hand. In early April, the Home Office issued proposals intended to simplify the liquor licensing laws, allowing some pubs -- subject to local circumstance -- to serve alcohol for as much as 24 hours a day.</p>
        <p>The proposals, which are not expected to be taken up by Parliament until at least next year, would bring Britain into line with the rest of Europe -- whose tourists visiting this country tend to find the 11 p.m. closing time absurdly uncivilized -- as well as acknowledging that the country is becoming, however reluctantly, a 24-hour society.</p>
        <p>The government has been slow in responding to changes in people's work and leisure habits. Most stores were forbidden to open at all on Sundays until 1994, when the government finally enacted a law allowing Sunday trading, but only for six hours.</p>
        <p>In big cities, where stores used to close at 6 p.m., many supermarkets and other retailers have begun leaving some of their busiest stores open until midnight, or even all night long (except on Sundays).</p>
        <p>As far as pubs go, it is hard to find someone who is not pleased by the government's proposals. Pub owners support the change because they want the extra business and because they are tired of behaving like nannies forced to discipline groups of drunken children. Customers support it because they want the right to drink into the wee hours of the morning if they feel like it.</p>
        <p>And police departments around the country support it because of a notorious nightly phenomenon in which pub customers up and down the country drink as much as possible between 11, when last orders are called, and about 11:25, when the last patron is pushed, sometimes staggering and cursing, into the night.</p>
        <p>It is not unusual, Ms. Oldfield said, for people to order five pints of lager and then try to finish them off at the rate of one every five minutes, like undergraduates in a fraternity drinking competition.</p>
        <p>''I really don't know how people can drink that much,'' she said, ''but they do.''</p>
        <p>What happens when all those customers pour out into the streets?</p>
        <p>''You get a huge glut of drunken people engaging in antisocial behavior,'' said Sgt. Tom McAndrew of the central Manchester police department, who runs an undercover team charged with keeping order in and around the city's pubs, bars and clubs at closing time.</p>
        <p>In his area, he said, the worst problems are gang attacks, assaults, menacing behavior, people being sick in the street and people beating each other up while waiting at taxi stands.</p>
        <p>National crime statistics show that as in Manchester, most street violence takes place in the middle of the night, after 11:30, when the last stragglers leave the pubs, and again after 2 a.m., when wine bars and clubs, which hold different licenses and which would also be allowed to stay open longer under the proposals, are required to close.</p>
        <p>''The law as it stands makes more difficult the problems and policing of public order,'' said the home secretary, Jack Straw. ''Fixed closing times may encourage binge drinking around last orders, with people hitting the streets -- and sometimes each other -- at the same time.''</p>
        <p>The hours also seem to encourage the unhealthy attitude toward alcohol that many people seem to associate with Britain, whose public image in Europe is based partly on the drunken hooligans who brawl in soccer stadiums and the drunken vacationers -- the so-called lager louts -- who brawl in resorts.</p>
        <p>To Sergeant McAndrew there's another reason to change the law. He and his team often finish work at 4 a.m. or so, a time when they are not necessarily ready to go directly home. But by then, he said, ''there's nowhere for us to go to have a drink.''</p>
