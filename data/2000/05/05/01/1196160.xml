        <p>It is an idea once considered unthinkable, and still widely viewed here as unlikely. And it is an idea that many people respond to with visceral criticism, or diatribes about a distant federal government picking on a homegrown winner.</p>
        <p>But in the Seattle region, where Microsoft has generated a staggering amount of wealth, only to see more than $100 billion of it vanish in recent weeks, the idea of breaking up the company hardly seems to be setting off widespread panic.</p>
        <p>''I really don't see the need for it, but if you ever did split up Microsoft, I think the new companies would just grow like weeds,'' explained Dana Nielsen, the owner of Ray's Cafe, a diner in a mall near the Microsoft campus here. ''So your stock would be worth more than ever.''</p>
        <p>Some express an almost messianic faith in the company's chairman. ''This is Bill Gates we're talking about here,'' said Alan Paisley, a Seattle guitarist. ''I wouldn't put it past Gates to somehow come out of this whole thing smelling like a rose. You get two or three little Microsofts running around out there, it could be very profitable for all concerned.''</p>
        <p>Such an analysis is stoutly rejected by Mr. Gates himself, who said Friday that ''no one should think that shareholder value would be preserved'' if the company he founded 25 years ago were dismantled. But even the mayor of Redmond, where the software giant has its headquarters, said the prospect of a breakup is not engendering nightmares.</p>
        <p>''People say to me, are you worried?'' said Mayor Rosemarie Ives. ''The answer is, not really. I'm confident that the innovation and creativity that have always been characteristic of Microsoft are going to continue, no matter what the form is.''</p>
        <p>With about 40 percent of all Microsoft shares in the hands of people who live in the Puget Sound region, the recent plunge in the company's stock, coupled with sharp declines in the shares of many Internet companies, could be the beginning of a major jolt to the area. Microsoft's stock is now down by nearly 45 percent from the all time-high of nearly $120 it reached late last year, meaning that Microsoft has lost more market value than the combined worth of all of the 25 next-biggest Northwest-based companies, including Boeing and Amazon.com.</p>
        <p>But as calamitous as all that sounds, life has not wildly changed here as a result -- not yet, anyway. Local economists say they know of no big projects that have been scuttled because of Microsoft's dive.</p>
        <p>Interviews with small-time Microsoft investors, who are remarkably easy to find in malls and streets here, turn up only isolated cases of semi-woe. One man explained that he recently backed out of a deal to buy a house -- not because he could no longer afford to do so, but because he just could not bear to cash out any of his Microsoft stock at $65, even though he bought most of it for a fraction of that. Whatever happens in the antitrust case, he said, he was sure it would come back up.</p>
        <p>''People are looking to Standard Oil or the breakup of the Bell system as an example,'' said Roger Qualman, executive vice president of a commercial real estate services company that studies economic trends in Redmond and the other towns across Lake Washington from Seattle. ''While people here don't think breaking up Microsoft is a good idea or an outcome to be desired, I don't think that they fear it, either. Quite to the contrary, in a lot of cases.''</p>
        <p>Many economic analysts say that breaking up Microsoft is not at all analogous to the dividing of Standard Oil or AT&amp;T, two other companies that lost epic antitrust battles with the government but also saw the values of their divided parts soar. Others also argue that Microsoft's recent stock decline stems from problems beyond the antitrust case, like lower-than-expected earnings or investor concerns that the company is poorly positioned as competition over software increasingly moves toward the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>Still, the operative faith here still seems to be that Microsoft is a good bet, no matter what happens with the breakup proposal. Many people said they were convinced that now was a good time to pick up more stock.</p>
        <p>''I sold a bunch off last year at $106, then I got nervous and bought back in'' at around $86, said Lou Kiersky, a retired Boeing engineer, who was at the Crossroads shopping center, near the Microsoft campus, late last week watching a chess match being played out on a giant floor board in the mall. ''I should have waited and bought back in now. Now would be a good time.''</p>
        <p>Asked what would happen if the company were split up, Jack Brown, a ski and bicycle technician at the Sports Authority, barely paused before answering: ''Short term, down. Longer term, up. Way up.'' He shot his thumb in the air in confidence.</p>
        <p>Whether the abiding faith in the company here is misplaced remains, of course, to be seen. And while most people continue to say a breakup is unlikely, no one seems to have any clear idea of how such a plan would be implemented -- and whether, most importantly, one or more of the new companies might be headquartered outside of the Seattle area.</p>
        <p>The Seattle region has had its share of both boom days and busts, in part because of the fortunes of Boeing, the mammoth aircraft manufacturer that still provides more than five times as many jobs locally as Microsoft. In the early 1970's, when the aircraft industry hit a particularly bad patch during the recession, 1 in 9 people in King County lost their jobs, said Dick Conway, co-publisher of the Puget Sound Economic Forecaster, a newsletter. A much-remembered billboard implored the last person leaving Seattle to turn out the lights.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's history, in contrast, is one of seemingly unbridled growth, both in its work force and its stock price. It has added about 1,000 local jobs each year, while its market value has increased exponentially.</p>
        <p>On the campus here, many Microsoft employees are clearly aghast at the idea that they could be forced to move to keep their jobs. The consistent public refrain from employees is faith that the company will prevail, and an insistence that it is ''business as usual'' in the meantime.</p>
        <p>''Microsoft hires type-A personalities,'' said Tod Nielsen, a vice president for product and business planning. ''We don't focus on things beyond our control. So instead of sitting back and worrying about the case, we focus on what we can control.''</p>
        <p>Said Peggy Brown, group manager for internal technical education: ''People are working on the same products, the same tasks. People do feel this case is a setback, but at some point, it's going to end'' in a positive way for the company.</p>
        <p>Bruce M. Brooks, a director of community affairs for the company and a former deputy mayor of Seattle, said he detected a ''quiet confidence,'' both on campus and in the wider community, that the case would be resolved favorably. People in the region do ask him about the antitrust battle all the time, he said, but not in a particularly anxious way.</p>
        <p>''The case is kind of like the weather,'' Mr. Brooks said. ''You sort of talk about it as the icebreaker, if you will. Then you get down to business.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft officials also pointed out that they still get 1,000 job applications a day and that their annual attrition rate, 7.4 percent, is well below the average for the high-technology industry. But its recent troubles do have competitors suggesting, and not so subtly, that now might be a good time for Microsoft employees to look around for new jobs.</p>
        <p>''There will be some confusion on the Microsoft campus for quite a while,'' said Kelly Jo MacArthur, senior vice president and general counsel for the Seattle-based Real Networks, which makes audio and video software for the Internet.</p>
        <p>''That confusion might lead to an opportunity for the rest of the high-tech community in Seattle,'' Ms. MacArthur continued, ''as employees at Microsoft are weighing their futures.''</p>
        <p>Outside the campus, there is a certain amount of gallows humor about Microsoft's travails and their possible impact on the area.</p>
        <p>''People are still very concerned about soaring housing prices here,'' Mr. Conway said. ''Well, that problem may well be cured.''</p>
        <p>The general opinion seems to be that Microsoft will not be split up, but that feeling is by no means unanimous. Some people feel that the company faces eventual evisceration because it ''didn't play ball with the politicians in Washington,'' as one man said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kiersky, the retired Boeing engineer, also thinks the company will face a split.</p>
        <p>''There's not much they can do,'' he said, shaking his head. ''There are too many people in the government, the Congress, our justice system, all gunning for them.''</p>
