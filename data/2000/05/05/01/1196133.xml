        <p>Dining out in Miami recently, Wade Houston was forced to relive his son Allan's pulsating Game 5 shot that sank the Miami Heat in the playoffs last May.</p>
        <p>''Someone in the restaurant found out it was my dad,'' Allan Houston said this afternoon. ''They just started coming up to him, acknowledging his presence and saying things to him.</p>
        <p>''I'm not even sure if he got good service or not.''</p>
        <p>With one foot in the Air Canada Center and the other on South Beach, the Knicks' unburdened shooting guard shuffled his feet and dressed for yet another playoff series.</p>
        <p>A half-hour before, he had let fly a satiny jump shot from above the top of the key. Forty-four seconds remained in Game 3 against Toronto, and the Knicks led by only 2 points when the ball swished through.</p>
        <p>Houston did not call ''all net,'' just as Larry Johnson did not call ''glass'' before he banked in a clutch 3-pointer to vanquish Vince Carter's Raptors and complete an impressive first-round sweep.</p>
        <p>Playground vernacular aside, yet another Knicks-Heat sequel was ensured. Houston would go back to Miami and the scene of his career-altering moment. One year after his slow-motion runner stopped hearts and eliminated the Heat, he is still the calm amid the chaos.</p>
        <p>Easy Al, his teammates call him, the most stress-free player on the floor.</p>
        <p>As the Knicks whooped and hollered on their way back to the locker room today -- ''Once again, New York-Miami, baby,'' Chris Childs bellowed. ''It's going to be a war!'' -- Houston quietly walked back out to the court for an interview with WFAN radio.</p>
        <p>He talked about the game with Walt Frazier. Side by side, two generations of Knicks cool.</p>
        <p>Almost nonchalantly, Houston scored a game-high 23 points over 40 minutes. When Patrick Ewing was missing and Latrell Sprewell was swarmed, Houston rose up over the outstretched arms of Tracy McGrady and knocked down 8 of 14 shots.</p>
        <p>If Houston's stroke did not pierce Toronto's hopes, his smarts hurt the Raptors.</p>
        <p>Charles Oakley committed a critical turnover with a minute left, whipping a risky pass into the first row. Dee Brown, the Raptors guard, never moved toward Oakley to retrieve the ball -- a fundamental tenet of the game.</p>
        <p>On the other end, Houston popped out toward the perimeter and made himself a target for a trapped Sprewell. ''Allan did a great job in coming to get that ball,'' Sprewell said. ''He saw I was double-teamed.''</p>
        <p>The son of Wade Houston, his coach at Tennessee, he went to the ball. It was a huge play, joining the Miami Miracle and Houston's 32-point explosion against Indiana in Game 6 of last year's Eastern Conference finals. Houston's ledger in close-out games keeps growing. Every time Coach Jeff Van Gundy grows concerned about Houston's passiveness, he re-emerges as a clutch player.</p>
        <p>''It's something that I always was in high school and I wanted to be,'' he said. ''It's something I pride myself on being. If you're a good shooter or great shooter or great scorer or whatever, it's not about whether you can do it, but when you do it. That's how you win playoff games. That's what that shot against Miami was about last year.''</p>
        <p>In a way, you wonder how Knicks-Heat can possibly take another implausible twist. Three years running they have gone the maximum number of games, and three times the theater has bordered on surreal.</p>
        <p>It's like Rambo III or Rocky IV, where all the story lines have been exhausted and some desperate screenwriter has to rely on the evil-twin angle.</p>
        <p>''Call it what you want, but all I know is I'm undefeated with these guys,'' Sprewell said about the Heat. ''We've won. I want to keep it that way.''</p>
        <p>Toronto Coach Butch Carter was asked afterward what he expected from the Knicks-Heat series. ''First of all, if there's going to be a fight,'' he said. ''And then, if everyone stays on the bench during the fight.''</p>
        <p>Tim Hardaway's 3-point heave in overtime on April 9 that shocked the Knicks only added to the rancor. ''It definitely feels good,'' Marcus Camby said of the chance to play Miami again. ''Ever since Tim hit that shot, that's all I've been thinking about is getting back down there and trying to redeem ourselves.''</p>
        <p>One by one, the Knicks were quizzed about their favorite Miami memory. Predictably, they all mentioned Houston's shot last year. Beyond that, Houston recalled another highlight. He once shot 75 on a Miami area golf course. ''That may have been bigger,'' he said, smiling.</p>
        <p>Before he left Toronto and returned to New York to prepare for Miami, Houston came across Johnson in the locker room.</p>
        <p>''Easy, way to work,'' Johnson said.</p>
        <p>''Thanks, Big Dawg.''</p>
        <p>''Hey, you call that?'' Houston added, referring to Johnson's 3-pointer.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, you didn't see me?''</p>
        <p>They laughed and eventually walked out to the bus, where their teammates and coaches were waiting. Easy Al and the Knicks were soon going back to Miami, where the madness began, where Wade Houston can't eat in private because his son keeps performing under pressure.</p>
