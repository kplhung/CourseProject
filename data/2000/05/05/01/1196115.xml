        <p>Just behind the tile wall in the Knicks' locker room, in front of a mirror the size of a movie screen, Larry Johnson brushed over the hints of gray in his hair as one nearby teammate crooned a rap lyric about the city of Miami.</p>
        <p>Ignoring the fuss around him, Johnson shrugged on a linen jacket and dusted off the slacks that hung on the low lines of a muscular 31-year-old body that seems drawn by Frank Lloyd Wright but eroded to the bone by years of wear. Some days, age is an enemy for Johnson. Today, experience acted as his support group.</p>
        <p>Here he was again. In the frantic close of Game 3 today, two Raptors moved in to harass Latrell Sprewell's dribble. As the fans madly rattled the noisemakers that had been handed out at the Air Canada Center, Johnson settled into a spot on the perimeter that has come to fit him like a favorite easy chair.</p>
        <p>He is comfortable there, perfectly relaxed when left open. So he was ready for the pass that Sprewell delivered and confidently released a 3-point shot that seemed torn from a pool shark's handbook. As the ball came out of the sky, it smacked the glass like an egg plopped on a skillet. Somehow, the ball slipped down the throat of the net and quickly cut off the air supply to the Raptors' last hope with 24.9 seconds on the clock.</p>
        <p>''When Jeff called that play, I said, 'I'm shooting this thing,' '' said Johnson, whose shot turned a 2-point game into a 5-point Knicks lead. ''I had my feet set and my mind set. If they had rotated to me, I probably would have turned the ball over. I had my mind ready to shoot. And I'll take it. Off the glass or not. If I had to bounce it in, I'll take it.''</p>
        <p>An instant later, the Raptors' season was over as the Knicks completed a sweep of the three-of-five-game first-round playoff series with an 87-80 victory. An instant later, the same budding supernovas who had infiltrated the Knicks' confidence in the regular season would exit their home court with their shoulders slumped and their eyes on the verge of tears.</p>
        <p>For Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady, their first playoff series was a learning tool. For a Knicks team that leaned on its experience through each tight game, this was just another stop on its annual springtime journey to Miami. Game 1 of the four-of-seven-game second-round series will begin Sunday at American Airlines Arena.</p>
        <p>''Got those cats again,'' Johnson said as he exited the court after scoring 8 of his 14 points in the fourth quarter. ''Got 'em again.''</p>
        <p>It's the fourth time in four years for these rivals. Out of the film reels containing all the fights, tension and suspensions, there is this one gnawing moment that lives in the pit of Pat Riley's stomach, an instant he has said that neither food nor drink can soothe: Allan Houston's incandescent runner to eliminate the Heat last May.</p>
        <p>Until today, Houston had been short on impact against Toronto. For two games, his defense had been mocked by McGrady and his shot had been pinned down by him, too. But a more assertive Houston turned up today. He curled sharply off screens set by Patrick Ewing to find shooting space and shot swiftly and surely for 23 points.</p>
        <p>''I'm happy for Allan,'' Sprewell said. ''He needed that kind of game for his confidence, especially going into the series against Miami. Now he can feel good about himself and about being a contributor to our success in this game.''</p>
        <p>Sprewell was the soul of the series, though. All of the junk food he resists, all of the work he puts in, all the genetic makeup he credits, all of it allowed him to chase a young phenom at a rate of 45.3 minutes per game. Indefatigable, Sprewell -- along with well-timed double-teams smartly installed by Coach Jeff Van Gundy for the series -- held Carter to a 15-for-50 shooting performance from the field during the series.</p>
        <p>Today, once again, Sprewell was the aggressive tag-along on Carter. In his lowest point total of the series, Carter finished with 15 points (5 for 17) but stayed in the game with 7 rebounds and 8 assists. Just like Sprewell, who had to deal with the double-teams Toronto Coach Butch Carter hurled at him today, Vince Carter passed well under pressure.</p>
        <p>But Carter did not have go-to shooters. He would pass to an open Muggsy Bogues or Dee Brown or Doug Christie. But each kept letting him down. While the Knicks hit 9 for 16 from 3-point range, the Raptors made just 3 of 21.</p>
        <p>''We weren't going to let Vince get shots off,'' said Sprewell, who finished with 11 points and 6 assists. ''He was going to have to depend on his teammates. When you're doubled, you have to find other ways to score. As he grows and learns more about double teams, he's going to find out ways to beat them. Another thing is, you have to get a lot better players around you.''</p>
        <p>Vince Carter had the wrong mix. He had a grizzled front line containing the former Knick Charles Oakley, whose only solace today was diluting the power of Ewing (2 for 8) and coming up with 14 rebounds, but the 20-year-old McGrady (5 for 14) fizzled on his inexperience and sore ankle. And perhaps the impressionable Raptors also buckled under the combustible atmosphere created by Butch Carter's controversy du jour.</p>
        <p>Marcus Camby was at the heart of Carter's manipulations. Although there were times in this series when Camby seemed shaken by the lawsuit fiasco Carter conjured up before Game 1, he composed himself today. Perhaps having the flu calmed him down, too.</p>
        <p>''The truth came to light,'' said Camby (7 points, 5 rebounds), the former Raptor who said two weeks ago that nobody wanted to play for Butch Carter. ''After hearing what their players said about everything, it definitely affected them more.''</p>
        <p>Maybe so. But still, the Raptors squeezed the Knicks to the last minute. Not one game was decided until the final 45 seconds. Today, there were three lead changes and four ties in the fourth quarter of a game in which neither team led by more than 7 points.</p>
        <p>In the wild swing of emotion, the Knicks took a 6-point lead after the first of Johnson's two fourth-quarter  3-pointers with nine minutes left only to lose the lead after 2 of their 18 turnovers. With the scored tied at  78-78 after two Carter free throws, Carter then came up with a block of Chris Childs's layup, but the ball fell into Johnson's hands, and he was fouled with 1 minute 11 seconds left.</p>
        <p>After Johnson hit both free throws to put the Knicks ahead, 80-78, Houston added a jumper and Antonio Davis hit two free throws for Toronto. Johnson then lined up his game-deciding 3-pointer. It was the same kind of position he was in with 48 seconds left in Game 1. And he knocked that one down, too.</p>
        <p>''They were forcing me to swing the ball,'' Sprewell said. ''But someone is open. L. J. got the 3. And I heard him call glass. Yes, I heard him.''</p>
        <p>Sprewell then smiled as he joked about the shot that Johnson admitted was a little lucky.</p>
        <p>''He's been in that position a hundred times,'' Sprewell said. ''He's been around a long time. He knew what to do from memory.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes, longevity has its benefits.</p>
