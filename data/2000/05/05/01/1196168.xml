        <p>Blyth Tate of New Zealand, the reigning world and Olympic champion, rode Welton Envoy to a faultless round over all 16 fences on the stadium jumping course to win the Rolex-Kentucky Horse Trials yesterday at the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington.</p>
        <p>The event, one of four in the world rated four-star, serves as the definitive Olympic trial for the United States team that will compete at the Olympics and is also a major prep for the Games.</p>
        <p>Tate and Welton Envoy, a horse competing in his first four-star event, was second with 39.4 penalties after Saturday. They kept that score with a clear round in the stadium jumping phase.</p>
        <p>David O'Connor of The Plains, Va., the individual silver medal winner at the 1996 Olympics, moved from third to second place at 39.8 when he completed the course without faults astride the American thoroughbred Rattle 'n Hum. O'Connor's Olympic teammate and wife, Karen, took third with a clear round and a final score of 42.6 points, riding Prince Panache.</p>
        <p>Kimberly Vinoski of Scottsville, Va., dropped from first place to fourth when her mount, Over the Limit, pulled down the top rail at the next-to-last fence.</p>
