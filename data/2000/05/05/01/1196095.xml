        <p>The most incongruous sight of the Jets' three-day minicamp for rookies this weekend: Bill Parcells turning his back on practice for several minutes Saturday to pet a cat that was hiding in the bushes next to the practice field.</p>
        <p>But Parcells is far from a mere spectator, even if he is expected to retire and pursue a television job before training camp begins in July. He is working with Mike Tannenbaum, director of contracts and pro personnel development, on contract negotiations and is a sounding board and counselor for Coach Al Groh.</p>
        <p>''One of the things that can occur is isolation,'' Groh said. ''Having Bill around is a tremendous resource. He knows what the head coach is going through. Why wouldn't you want a Hall of Fame coach around to talk with?''</p>
        <p>Groh said Parcells asked if he could attend practice and permission was granted. But Parcells stepped on the field infrequently and rarely talked to players, seemingly making a concerted effort not to get in Groh's way. Parcells spent about five minutes after today's practice talking to the undrafted wide receiver Cory Peterson, but did not talk to reporters during the weekend.</p>
        <p>Focus Is Not on Pickens</p>
        <p>Although Carl Pickens, an eight-year veteran with 530 receptions for 6,887 yards and 63 touchdowns, seems the most obvious choice to fill the Jets' obvious need for a top receiver, Al Groh suggested that speculation that the Jets would pursue him when he was released by the Cincinnati Bengals was inaccurate.</p>
        <p>''You're spending more time on it than I am,'' Groh told reporters. ''You're talking about it a lot more than I am.''</p>
        <p>Groh said he had a list of about seven receivers -- most of whom are still under contract with teams but are likely to be released after the June 1 salary purge. One is Andre Hastings, who was released by New Orleans last week. Hastings caught 40 passes last year for 564 yards and a touchdown, but in 1996 with Pittsburgh he caught 72 passes. Still, Hastings seems unlikely to step into the role of No. 1 receiver.</p>
        <p>Groh also said he was pleased with the two receivers the Jets drafted, Laveranues Coles and Windrell Hayes. Groh praised Coles's speed, although it was hard to tell on the short field the Jets practiced on if Coles was able to break away from defenders.</p>
        <p>Lewis Unsigned and Unseen</p>
        <p>Al Groh seems unconcerned about linebacker Mo Lewis, who is not in the Jets' off-season camp because he technically does not have a contract. Groh said he did not know if Lewis would attend the minicamp for Jets veterans from May 23 to 25.</p>
        <p>Lewis was designated as the team's franchise player, and the Jets hope to work out a long-term deal. But it would behoove them to wait until after July 15, when, if a deal is worked out, the Jets would get their franchise tag back and be able to use it again next season.</p>
        <p>Groh does not seem worried about Lewis's reputation for inconsistent off-season conditioning and said he had not spoken to Lewis. ''But only by suggestion that I leave the negotiations to the negotiators,'' Groh said. ''I think when it comes time to play football, I know how he approaches the game and how he feels about his performance. He'll be ready.''</p>
        <p>Groh said linebacker Bryan Cox, who had abdominal surgery before the end of last season, was recovering well.</p>
        <p>Rookies' Agent Set for Talks</p>
        <p>Ricky Lefft, the representative for the first-round picks Shaun Ellis and John Abraham, was at the Jets' complex Friday and had a brief, informal conversation with Mike Tannenbaum, the Jets' salary cap and contract guru. Lefft said negotiations most likely would not begin for at least 10 days.</p>
        <p>The rookie salary pool has been set at $5.3 million, and Tannenbaum will have his work cut out to get all four first-round draft picks signed without holdouts.</p>
        <p>Another Hofstra Long Shot</p>
        <p>This year's feel-good candidate to follow Wayne Chrebet on the long-shot path from undrafted free agent to the Jets' roster is Vaughn Sanders, a former Hofstra running back whose college career ended in the fifth game of last season when he shattered his left ankle, 6 yards short of setting the school rushing record.</p>
        <p>Al Groh, who grew up on Long Island, has long followed local teams, and Sanders's story caught his eye.</p>
        <p>''I happened to read the article following the game in which he was injured and it detailed the circumstances that he was short of the record,'' Groh said. Groh attended Hofstra's pro workout day and Sanders was invited to camp. He also participated in the Giants' rookie camp last weekend.</p>
        <p>''I think I have a real shot,'' Sanders said. ''I'm loving it. If I can just come here and get a contract, that would be the most positive thing I could do.''</p>
