        <p>Tensions between Jewish settlers and the Israeli government intensified today as Prime Minister Ehud Barak prepared to seek cabinet approval for the transfer of three Arab villages near Jerusalem to the Palestinian Authority.</p>
        <p>At the same time, tensions between Mr. Barak's government and the Palestinians also escalated over the settlement issue, after the Israeli Housing Ministry announced that it had interrupted a recent freeze on new West Bank construction for ''an exception.''</p>
        <p>The Housing Ministry confirmed today that it had opened competition for bids to develop close to 200 new units in Maale Adumim, the largest and most suburban-style settlement, which Israel hopes to keep under its control.</p>
        <p>Since the future status of all the Jewish settlements is under negotiation, however, the Palestinians saw that as an attempt by Mr. Barak to mollify the settlers at their expense.</p>
        <p>The announcement soured the atmosphere for the resumption of ''final status'' peace talks today in the Red Sea resort city of Eilat, where the negotiators are to be joined on Tuesday by American peace envoys. The goal is to hammer out a framework for a final peace accord before the summer.</p>
        <p>''I think the decision of the Israeli government concerning the building of new settlement units shows the real attitude of this government,'' said Yasir Abed Rabbo, a negotiator and senior aide to Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. ''I think Mr. Barak is not focused on the process that we are beginning here.''</p>
        <p>As if through a looking glass, settler leaders see Mr. Barak's settlement policy completely differently. While Mr. Barak has said repeatedly that he would seek to annex large Israeli settlements, which infuriates the Palestinians, he has also made it clear that some settlements would have to be evacuated, which infuriates the settlers.</p>
        <p>Last spring, shortly after Mr. Barak was elected, the settlers themselves selected a new and more moderate leadership, in pursuit of Israeli public support. Mr. Barak worked to nurture a relationship with them, issuing frequent expressions of support for their cause and chagrin that Israel would be forced to concede West Bank territory to the Palestinians in the interest of making peace.</p>
        <p>But today it seemed to Israelis that the bond has been ruptured. Settler leaders said they were joining forces with 10 right-wing anti-peace groups, with which they met this weekend, to battle Mr. Barak's peacemaking plans.</p>
        <p>They have jointly scheduled a rally for May 15 in Zion Square in Jerusalem. It would be the first right-wing demonstration there in five years, since shortly before Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist.</p>
        <p>The rally's slogan will be: ''Oslo did not bring peace -- enough with the withdrawals for naught.'' The slogan refers to Israeli troop withdrawals from the West Bank under the terms of the interim peace agreement signed in Oslo in 1993, which laid the groundwork for the present final peace talks.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Barak is not everybody's prime minister,'' said Yehoshua Mor-Yosef, spokesman for the Settlers Council, referring to a campaign theme of Mr. Barak. ''He is Arafat's prime minister.</p>
        <p>''We have tried to obey the law and to do things that will give us the broadest public support,'' he said.  ''But now things have changed. This is now a fight for our homes. And in a fight for your home, you don't stop to make sure that all of your i's are dotted and your t's crossed.''</p>
        <p>A confrontation today with militant settlers in the divided city of Hebron, who have never sought or received broad public support, added to the tension. Israeli soldiers forcibly removed scores of them from a new encampment they were staking out in the heart of a Palestinian neighborhood.</p>
        <p>The settlers had hauled a rust-orange shipping container to the land on Saturday night; several barricaded themselves inside with provisions and prayer books while others surrounded it. This morning, the soldiers and the police dragged away those on the outside, and with difficulty pried open the container to remove those within.</p>
        <p>A well-known militant settler, Elyakim Haetzni, later declared the struggle the start of a ''civil war.'' And he provoked an uproar by saying that soldiers should refuse orders to evacuate settlements and that settlers should fight back, building a private militia if necessary.</p>
        <p>An official for Peace Now, an Israeli group that opposes the settlements, filed a complaint against Mr. Haetzni, a former member of Parliament, arguing that his remarks were tantamount to ''sedition.''</p>
        <p>The secular leader of the Settlers Council, Benny Kashriel, the mayor of Maale Adumim, said, ''The readiness for a fierce struggle grows every time more territory is handed over.'' He told the newspaper Maariv that he feared that the evacuation of settlements as part of a peace deal with the Palestinians would lead to violence.</p>
        <p>''That is not a threat, but an explanation of the situation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To Palestinians, watching from the outside, the whole conversation seemed to put the cart before the horse. No deal is imminent, and the evacuation of settlements, if it is to occur, seems a much too distant prospect from their perspective.</p>
        <p>The public conversation in Israel reinforced the notion that the Israelis are really negotiating among themselves about what concessions to the Palestinians can be tolerated. Underscoring that impression, Mr. Barak's associates said this weekend that he has considered calling a national referendum on a framework peace agreement. ''What framework agreement?'' a senior Palestinian official said. ''Are they on the moon?''</p>
        <p>Palestinian officials also mock the roiling debate in Israel about Mr. Barak's plans to turn over three villages near Jerusalem -- including Abu Dis -- as a ''down payment'' on future territorial concessions. The villages are already under Palestinian civil control, they said, and the Oslo accord stipulated that such land  would convert to full control eventually.</p>
        <p>''So why is this such a gain for us?'' a Palestinian official asked. ''It's 0.3 percent of the West Bank, and it may be next to Jerusalem, but no one will be fooled into thinking that Abu Dis is Jerusalem.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak's associates expect that he will win cabinet backing for the decision on Wednesday. But if so, the National Religious Party, which represents religious Zionists and settlers, said it would deliberate leaving the government.</p>
        <p>And Natan Sharansky, the Russian immigrant leader, opposed the move, saying, ''I think that to transfer Abu Dis and other villages at this stage as a down payment, that would mean the final payment is East Jerusalem, and to that we cannot agree.''</p>
