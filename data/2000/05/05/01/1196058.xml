        <p>For half a century the giant power plant across the Thames from St. Paul's Cathedral had been an eyesore that reflected postwar London's indifference to its appearance. Now, thanks to the alchemy of culture, the dark brick monolith with its towering chimney is being hailed as a symbol of rebirth. On May 11 Queen Elizabeth II will inaugurate the space as the Tate Modern, the first authentic modern art museum in London.</p>
        <p>In truth, from afar the building looks much the same, the only novelty being a two-story glass box running its length. But inside its thick walls, all that survives from the past, is a vast atrium called Turbine Hall. Most crucially, the new museum's 20th-century collection, long squeezed into the old Tate Gallery up river in London, now has ample room to breathe. The move has in turn freed up the old Tate, renamed the Tate Britain, for the exclusive presentation of British art.</p>
        <p>For Londoners, there is still more to celebrate because the Tate Modern is also helping to gentrify the run-down borough of Southwark and its riverfront. Already Shakespeare's Globe Theater and the nearby Jerwood Space arts center are drawing crowds to the area, while a Thames walkway lined with pubs and restaurants now runs west to the Royal Festival Hall, London's main concert hall. And in June a new footbridge will link the museum to St. Paul's. The Tate Modern, though, is at the heart of this new Left Bank.</p>
        <p>From the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris to the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain, examples of museums promoting urban renewal are plentiful. But for the Tate this angle proved a useful marketing tool. Having picked the site for an annex, museum officials needed to raise $214 million to convert the abandoned power plant. And they understood that a museum that promised economic and social benefits to the city would be an easier sell than art for art's sake.</p>
        <p>The strategy worked. The Tate quickly obtained a $90 million grant from profits from a new national lottery and another $19 million from the government to remove electrical turbines and other heavy equipment. When museum officials set out to raise the balance through private donations, they were helped by a report prepared by the management consultants McKinsey and Company, which projected that the Tate Modern would create 2,400 jobs and generate at least $80 million annually in income for London.</p>
        <p>Leading the crusade was Sir Nicholas Serota, 56, an art historian with a penchant for empire building, who has been director of the Tate since 1988. He took over just as the Tate Liverpool was opening, and five years later he added the Tate St. Ives in Cornwall as the museum's second satellite. At the same time he doubled the number of visitors to the Tate Gallery, not only through Cezanne, Jackson Pollock and other itinerant blockbusters, but also through innovative rehangings of its permanent collection.</p>
        <p>His main constraint, however, was the Tate Gallery itself. Founded in 1897 by the sugar magnate Sir Henry Tate as a museum of British art, it was soon also the main London home of international modern art, resulting in a bizarre cohabitation between  local luminaries like Turner, Gainsborough and Constable and modern masters like Matisse, Picasso and Rothko. And because of space limitations, the Tate could show only about 15 percent of its 6,000 paintings, 1,300 sculptures and 50,000 works on paper.</p>
        <p>The logic of building a ''new'' Tate, then, seemed overwhelming, not only to ease the tensions of its split personality but also to give its modern collection quarters comparable to those of the Pompidou Center and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. And the timing seemed right: thanks to the Tate's high-profile Turner Prize, awarded annually to a contemporary artist, and to the buzz stirred by so-called Y.B.A.'s -- Young British Artists -- through such shows as ''Sensation,'' public interest in new art has never been higher here.</p>
        <p>The search for a site took two years. ''We had been looking for a landmark site, which meant on the river, and what better landmark than opposite St. Paul's?'' Sir Nicholas recalled. ''By preserving the building, we also secured a much larger volume than had we built a new museum. Still more important, the power plant gave a greater variety of spaces and moods than something built by a single architect.''</p>
        <p>The architecture competition drew 148 applicants, who were whittled down to six finalists. And in the end, better-known names like Renzo Piano, Rafael Moneo, Tadao Ando and Rem Koolhaas were passed over for the small Swiss practice of Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron. ''We didn't just want to restore the building but to transform it, and they came up with unique solutions,'' Sir Nicholas explained. ''We're very enthusiastic about the way they use materials, wood, glass, concrete, iron. Their work is highly tactile, sensuous, very pure.''</p>
        <p>The Tate is not alone in suddenly viewing with fresh eyes the vast industrial edifice designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott in 1947. Its first life was brief. It began operating as a power plant only in 1963 after years of construction and was closed by 1981, narrowly escaping demolition in the late 1980's. But some British critics have begun describing it as Scott's masterpiece. And they are close to unanimous in praising Herzog &amp; de Meuron for turning it into a museum without negating its past.</p>
        <p>The design is both simple and daring. The main entrance at the western end of the building leads down a ramp into the cathedral-like space of Turbine Hall, 500 feet long, 75 feet wide and 115 feet high, with iron girders and pillars emphasizing its industrial lineage. The information desk, ticket booths, bookstore, coffee shop and auditorium are on two levels easily accessible from the hall. The dark gray northern wall of the atrium is in turn punctuated by glass terraces that serve as ''light clouds.''</p>
        <p>The museum proper lies behind this wall. And here again, by using concrete and unstained white oak floors, the architects have kept alive the building's industrial soul. The Tate Modern's permanent collection occupies galleries on the third and fifth floors, some of them of double-height to accommodate large sculptures, while the fourth floor is for temporary exhibitions. The sixth and seventh floors, added by the architects to create a ''light beam'' at night, include a bar and a restaurant with views of St. Paul's and its environs. Plans to turn the chimney into an observation tower were postponed for lack of funds.</p>
        <p>For the Tate Modern's inauguration, its director, Lars Nittve, has chosen not to present the permanent collection chronologically or by school, but rather through themes established by the French Academy three centuries ago: landscape, still life, the nude and history paintings. For Collection 2000, as the display is called, these themes are nonetheless interpreted fairly broadly, so that, say, landscape includes matter and environment, and nude embraces action and body. The purpose is to confront styles and periods, for instance, by placing a ''Lilies'' by Monet opposite a stone installation by Richard Long.</p>
        <p>At the Tate Britain, which unveiled its new identity in March, its director, Stephen Deuchar, has also opted for a thematic approach in ''RePresenting Britain,'' the name for the new display of British art from 1500 to the present. And here again, albeit covering a much larger period with a wider range of themes, the key word is juxtaposition. ''We want to explore the character of Britishness,'' Mr. Deuchar said. ''We also want to emphasize that we have a gallery covering several centuries, where historical and modern works are together, not the old on the left and the new on the right.''</p>
        <p>The response of British art critics to this approach -- with, say, a 1973 portrait by Maggi Hambling beside a 1741 portrait by Hogarth, or ''Seated Figure'' by Francis Bacon beside Nicholas Hilliard's portrait of Queen Elizabeth I -- has not been altogether approving. Some critics considered it thought provoking, others dismissed it as gimmicky. ''Themes are a way of not saying something definite about anything,'' Waldemar Januszczak wrote in The Sunday Times of London. ''They are the first resort of the superficial.''</p>
        <p>Accompanying ''RePresenting Britain'' is a temporary exhibition, ''Ruskin, Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites,'' marking the centenary of John Ruskin's death in 1900. With some 250 works, this show, which runs through May 29, offers a view of 19th-century British art as seen through the prism of Ruskin's tastes and opinions. If there is a case for having a museum devoted exclusively to British art, some critics feel this exhibition makes it more convincingly than ''RePresenting Britain.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, another temporary show at the Tate Britain, installations by the Beirut-born British artist Mona Hatoum that close on July 23, raises a question that the Tate has not entirely resolved: when should modern and contemporary British art be shown in the Tate Britain or in the Tate Modern? Perhaps artists will graduate from one to the other, but this is not clear.</p>
        <p>Certainly, the Tate Britain, which will complete an extension of its own next year, does not want to be upstaged by its younger sibling: it has retained the annual show of the Turner Prize finalists as well as the prize's televised award ceremony; and between July 6 and Sept. 24 it will be presenting ''New British Art 2000: Intelligence,'' the first in a series of exhibitions of contemporary British art to be held every three years.</p>
        <p>But for the moment the spotlight is understandably on the Tate Modern, the building and its collection. The museum is also presenting a temporary show dedicated to the Herzog &amp; de Meuron architectural practice and a special installation in Turbine Hall by Louise Bourgeois. In the future, though, it is counting on three major exhibitions each year to draw the crowds. After all, to achieve its annual target of two million visitors, it knows that blockbuster is still the name of the game.</p>
