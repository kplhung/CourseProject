        <p>CRAZY</p>
        <p>By Benjamin Lebert</p>
        <p>Translated by Carol Brown Janeway. 178 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $17.95.</p>
        <p>We are a long way from Goethe with Benjamin Lebert's autobiographical coming-of-age first novel, ''Crazy,'' which was written when the author was just 16 and which became a best seller in Germany.</p>
        <p>Still, the book could easily have been called ''The Sorrows of Young Benni.'' Its 16-year-old protagonist is beset with problems. He has been thrown out of four schools because of his problems with math, and at the beginning of the novel is about to begin his fifth, Castle Neuseelen Boarding School, near Munich, where he will repeat the ninth grade.</p>
        <p>On top of this -- actually the cause of it -- he ''has had a partial paralysis of the left side of the body since birth,'' as his mother puts it in a letter to his new school's headmaster, which means ''that he either cannot perform or has difficulty performing such fine-motor tasks as tying his shoes, using a fork and knife, drawing geometrical figures, using a pair of scissors'' and that ''he has problems with sports, cannot ride a bicycle and has difficulty with any movement that involves a sense of balance.''</p>
        <p>Also Benni worries about how much his parents have been fighting with each other lately, and how they will react to his sister's being gay, because ''they're very sensitive about stuff like this.''</p>
        <p>But as it is, the novel is titled ''Crazy'' (as it was in its original, German edition), a word that seems to resonate strongly for German-speaking people, perhaps because of the way it goes with the sounds of the language.</p>
        <p>'' 'As far as I can see you're not disabled and you're not normal,' '' Benni reports his new roommate, Janosch, saying to him. '' 'Far as I can see, you're crazy.' He laughs.  'Uh-huh -- you're not disabled, you're crazy.'</p>
        <p>'' 'Crazy?'</p>
        <p>'' 'Crazy!' Now we're both laughing. It feels good and we can't stop.''</p>
        <p>Like many other qualities of the novel, the piquancy of the word seems to have been lost in translation.</p>
        <p>''Crazy'' is not without its promising moments. A few nights after Benni's arrival at Castle Neuseelen (the word, hopefully enough, means ''new souls''), his dormitory mates plan, in defiance of the rules, a visit to the girls' corridor. Once having arrived there (by leaping onto and climbing a fire escape, a puzzling accomplishment considering his partial paralysis), Benni gets high on beer and is accosted and seduced by Marie Hangerl, who tells him, ''Someone once told me cripples are just people too.'' Benni's passage from anxiety to a sense of triumphant exhilaration to sadness at being used is touchingly described.</p>
        <p>But almost everywhere else the story lies limp on the page. Often the problem is simply that something seems to be missing, some word or phrase or telling gesture. For instance, in one conversation about their futures Janosch tells Benni, ''Of course I want to have a child.'' The reason? ''I want to know what it's like when your son comes lurching over to you and mumbles, 'Pa -- I'm not drunk, you can trust me one hundred percent.' ''</p>
        <p>Huh?</p>
        <p>When it does become clear what the boys are talking about, they all too often sound as banal as greeting cards. On the subject of friendship Janosch remarks: ''Friendship is something inside of you. . . . You can't see it, but it's there all the same.'' On reading: ''Literature is where you read a book and feel you could put a little mark under every line because it's true. . . . When every sentence is simply right. When it reveals something about the world. And life.''</p>
        <p>Even more irritating, you find it difficult to believe in Benni as a coherent character. He seems to keep forgetting that he is partially paralyzed. He cannot light a cigarette, but he can help his mother with the dishes. He cannot walk down the hall properly, but he can leap onto and climb that fire escape. It sounds as if the author wants his persona to be handicapped only when it is convenient for him to be.</p>
        <p>But what the book's failure finally comes down to is the matter of tone. To pull off yet another story of boarding-school unhappiness, you not only need something new to say but you also have to say it originally. There is nothing whatsoever fresh about the language of ''Crazy.'' It tastes like a week-old salad.</p>
        <p>Several times in his narrative Benni refers to the school as the Castle (''Are you from the Castle?'' one character asks the boys), and you wonder offhandedly if he has Kafka's in mind. You doubt it at first because Benni's tastes do not seem to run beyond Pink Floyd and Stephen King. But later there's a reference to Kafka as the sort of writer who gets his ''intellect down on paper.'' So possibly ''Crazy'' is saying that even if you reach the Castle, the mystery does not clear up.</p>
        <p>That's about as deep as the novel gets.</p>
