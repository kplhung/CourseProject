        <p>ASK Michael Rothschild, the 47-year-old chief executive of Maxager and he'll diplomatically answer that many of his young, techie programmers are ''interesting looking.''</p>
        <p>But when it comes to selling Maxager's product, software that helps industrial companies determine what to bid during Internet auctions, Mr. Rothschild sends out a sales force that's a lot closer to his age -- people he has recruited from the basic industries that Maxager serves.</p>
        <p>Many of his potential customers are themselves middle aged and, while eager to buy or sell industrial goods on the Internet, they are afraid, Mr. Rothschild explained. ''The kid with the nose ring and crazy hair may do well in our research labs, but he's not going to allay those fears on the manufacturing floor.''</p>
        <p>So much for the new economy rendering obsolete the old pros of the old economy.</p>
        <p>As more and more business-to-business electronic marketplaces crowd onto the Internet, the selling of goods and services may often seem to have turned into a youngster's game -- a forum in which techno-entrepreneurs in their 20's and early 30's are running the show. And in fact, that perception is pretty accurate when it comes to writing the software, designing the Web pages and otherwise building the backbone of those electronic services.</p>
        <p>Increasingly, though, the young entrepreneurs are recognizing that, in the same way that their parents often have trouble comprehending exactly what it is that they do for a living, so do many of their prospective customers.</p>
        <p>And that is particularly true in the so-called b-to-b segment of the e-commerce world, where the suppliers and purchasing folks that make up the customer base are often less conversant with HTML and URL's than they are with the old-economy talk of ''R.F.Q.'s'' and ''S.K.U.'s'' (Those last two abbreviations refer to ''request for quotations'' and ''stock-keeping units,'' if any Web-heads ask; and if they do, the  defense rests its case).</p>
        <p>No wonder the b-to-b dot-coms are scouring the steel mills, the auto parts companies and the other basic industries, looking for people who can talk the talk that will persuade the target customers to switch their main transactional mode from the handshake to the mouse click.</p>
        <p>''The 30-year-old who understands the technology is an important part of the success equation, but it takes a grizzled industry veteran to persuade corporate buyers to change their entrenched habits,'' said Andreas W. Eversbusch, the 39-year-old chief operating officer for EDS CoNext, an electronic corporate purchasing service owned by Electronic Data Systems.</p>
        <p>Actually, the ''grizzled veterans'' don't have to be all that grizzled to qualify as a Mr. or Ms. Outside for an e-commerce company. By age 32, Diana L. Wright had clocked 10 years in sales for industrial stalwarts like Honeywell and General Electric before becoming director of industrial supplies in February for EqualFooting.com, an online marketplace for industrial supplies and construction equipment.</p>
        <p>''As soon as a prospective supplier realizes I have similar experiences, our conversation goes up to a higher level,'' she said.</p>
        <p>How does she like being on the dot-com side of the digital divide? ''I didn't take a pay cut to come here, but I would have,'' she said. ''Things are so rigid in the corporate environment, and so stimulating here.''</p>
        <p>But the Diana Wrights of the world are not always easy to find. Signing on with an e-business is by definition riskier than sticking it out with a Fortune 500 company. Recent gyrations in technology stocks have made compensation packages that rely heavily on stock options -- the dot-com dangling carrot -- seem even more risky than they did a month or so ago.</p>
        <p>And, Ms. Wright's enthusiasm notwithstanding, the culture shock can be a job killer. Thomas V. Colella, a recruiter at Korn/Ferry International, recently recruited a paper industry executive with 30 years' experience to work at a fledgling electronic paper exchange. The man quit after six months.</p>
        <p>''He just hated working with kids who knew nothing about running a business,'' Mr. Colella said.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Colella and other recruiters say there are many in industry who willingly heed the Internet's siren call.</p>
        <p>''People who've been with an organization for 25 years leave a chunk of money on the table, but they make the move because they want equity and because they're bored,'' said Christopher C. Nadherny, a recruiter at Spencer Stuart who recently placed ''a lifer at Dow Chemical'' into the presidency of an online chemicals marketplace.</p>
        <p>The old-economy transplants bring more than a fluency in industrial jargon; they bring an inside track to their former companies, which are often the kinds of customers over which e-commerce companies salivate.</p>
        <p>Robert Shirley, a former Federal Express executive who is now senior vice president for sales for the online printing service NowDocs.com, helped NowDocs get a $30,000 contract -- its largest single job yet  -- to print and deliver training manuals for FedEx. Similarly, Michael S. Oswald, NowDocs's staff lawyer, who had previously worked for a software company called Acuity, has brought in so many law firms as customers that ''Rob says he's our best source of leads,'' said Brad Adamske, 36, NowDocs's founder.</p>
        <p>''Frankly, I hadn't thought of recruiting people from industry for sales leads, but I'm sure thinking about it now,'' Mr. Adamske said.</p>
        <p>Recently, NowDocs hired Tamara Johnson, a saleswoman from Xerox, figuring she could bring entree to that company as well as to other customers that were tired of doing their own printing. And Mr. Adamske is wooing a salesman who he hopes will help persuade his soon-to-be former employer to invest in NowDocs.</p>
        <p>After those recruited from the industrial ranks help land clients, they can serve as translators, explaining to their dot-com bosses how to keep old-economy customers happy.</p>
        <p>For instance, the three founders of EqualFooting, all of whom are tech types and thus used to working at Internet speed, had been giving prospective buyers only four hours to respond to a supplier's price offer. Ms. Wright persuaded them to change that to 24 hours. ''They just didn't realize that buyers are out in the field, not tied to a desk or a phone,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She also persuaded the company to run a promotion in which buyers could win free safety gloves and goggles for buying specific amounts. Why? She knew from her own experience that extra safety equipment always comes in handy.</p>
        <p>EqualFooting.com plans to set up a financing service on its Web site soon, and the company is already looking for someone familiar with making small-business loans to run it, according to Aaron Martin, 30, who is one of the EqualFooting founders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin extols the value of recruiting from the old economy. He noted that it was  the people recruited from industry on his staff who persuaded him to run pictures next to every item on his Web page, rather than expect customers to click for a photograph. And, at their suggestion, Mr. Martin  has put industry types on his telephone help desk.</p>
        <p>''It's a lot easier to train them on how to answer tech questions,'' he said, ''than to teach them about industrial supplies.''</p>
