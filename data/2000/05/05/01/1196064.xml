        <p>When most technology professionals and consumers hear the name Excite@Home, they generally think of cable modems. After all, the company was formed by the merger of the Excite Web portal and the At Home cable modem venture.</p>
        <p>But with much of the buzz in the Internet and communications industries these days surrounding mobile data applications, Excite@Home is making a mobile move as well.</p>
        <p>Today, the company, which is controlled by AT&amp;T, intends to announce that it has developed a version of the Excite portal for mobile applications, to be called, naturally enough, Excite Mobile. The concept is to let consumers use wireless phones or other mobile communications devices to receive e-mail, news, weather and other electronic items provided by Excite. The address for the new site is mobile.excite.com.</p>
        <p>Yahoo, one of Excite's main competitors, has already staked its claim in the mobile world, striking partnerships with Sprint's wireless phone unit and Bell Mobility, a big wireless communications provider in Canada.</p>
        <p>Although Excite might be expected to work closely with AT&amp;T's wireless communications operation, one of the nation's biggest, Excite has not yet announced partnerships with any wireless providers.</p>
