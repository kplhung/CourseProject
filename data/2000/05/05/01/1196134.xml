        <p>Forget Hillary and Rudy. Never mind George W. and Al Gore. For political insiders from here to Albany, the race to watch right now is a special election for a seat on the Nassau County Legislature.</p>
        <p>Although only about 41,000 people are eligible to vote in it, the special election that will be held on Long Island on Tuesday will determine the future of Nassau County politics and could have ramifications for those other, better-known races that are coming down the road in November.</p>
        <p>The Nassau race is occasioned by the death in March of Barbara Johnson, a Democrat who represented Port Washington and neighboring communities on the North Shore. The loss cost the Democrats their first majority in the legislative branch in 80 years and left it evenly divided between nine Democrats and nine Republicans, at a time when the county government is grappling with a fiscal crisis. The party that wins the election wins the decisive vote.</p>
        <p>As Darren Bloch, the chief of staff for Democrats in the Legislature, put it, ''It is a jump ball for the Legislature.''</p>
        <p>The election offers Nassau's Republican Party a rare second chance to regain some of the ground it lost in November, when it not only lost control of the Legislature but also suffered major upsets on town and local levels as voters rebelled over the financial troubles that have bedeviled the county under recent Republican stewardship.</p>
        <p>The question now is whether Nassau County's Republican machine, long a force to reckon with on the state and national levels and virtually omnipotent in local affairs, is broken down or just temporarily out of service. Since the suburbs are expected to play a pivotal role in the race for the United States Senate, it is no idle question.</p>
        <p>But winning has its risks as well. The  party that gets control of the Legislature will almost surely have to enact a series of  unpopular measures, from layoffs and service cuts to fee and tax increases, to help put the debt-ridden county back in the black. ''Does anybody really want to win this?'' remarked Howard A. Scarrow, a professor of political science at the State University at Stony Brook.</p>
        <p>The candidates all profess that they do. The Democrats chose Ms. Johnson's son, Craig Johnson, a 29-year-old bankruptcy lawyer, to run for the seat. The Republicans picked Linda Green, 52, an assistant principal and former North Hemsptead town clerk who was voted out of office during the anti-Republican backlash in November.</p>
        <p>Then there is the none-of-the-above option: Benjamin L. Zwirn, 48, a former North Hempstead town supervisor who has built a reputation as a maverick by winning elections but making many enemies in both parties along the way, is running on the Green Party line.</p>
        <p>The district is considered up for grabs. On paper, Republicans might have a slight edge: there are 16,000 registered Republicans and 15,000 registered Democrats. But there are also 10,000 unaffiliated registered voters and Democrats have had many successes here during the last decade. Ms. Johnson, a Democrat, won two-thirds of the vote in her last campaign.</p>
        <p>So far, the campaign has focused on three R's: Republicans, reassessment and residency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson is largely running against the Republican Party. One of his campaign mailings attacks the Republican county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta. ''You know the old adage about the fox guarding the hen house?'' asks the brochure, which shows a fox looking at several newly hatched chicks. ''That's what it would be like if Tom Gulotta's Republican machine regained the majority in the County Legislature.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Green has tried to counter by stressing her independence from the party. ''Ladies and gentlemen, it is true I am a Republican,'' she said at a debate two weeks ago. ''And before I was a Republican, I was Linda Green. And I still am.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Green has tried to run on an anti-reassessment platform. In March, Nassau agreed to overhaul its property tax system and reassess every property in the county. The problem with the current system, critics say, is that people in poorer communities pay more than their fair share of taxes and the cash-starved county is forced to pay out hundreds of millions of dollars to people who win challenges of their taxes.</p>
        <p>But a countywide reassessment would probably raise the assessments on homes in wealthy areas like those in the district. Ms. Green has seized on the issue with campaign fliers that say, ''Linda Green will fight the Democrats' tax reassessment scheme.''</p>
        <p>Democrats respond that she is fear-mongering, and note that the countywide reassessment has already been approved and that it is not a product of the Democrats alone, since it was supported by Charles O'Shea, the Republican county assessor, Mr. Gulotta, and five out of nine Republican legislators.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zwirn is campaigning as an outsider. ''There's not a dime's worth of difference between the parties,'' he said, but officials in both parties say he spoke with them about running on their ballot lines before going on the Greens' line.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Zwirn is running on a pledge not to raise taxes and to place a limit on the amount of increases caused by reassessment, he has attracted the most notice for his accusations that Mr. Johnson is not really a resident of the district. He faxed reporters copies of a 1999 alumni directory in which Mr. Johnson is listed at a Manhattan address, and a listing for Mr. Johnson from the Manhattan phone book.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson responded that while he has an apartment in Manhattan, his official residence is a house in Port Washington. He said that he has always voted in Port Washington and that his driver's license lists Port Washington as his home address.</p>
        <p>After two of Mr. Zwirn's supporters tried to have Mr. Johnson removed from the ballot this week, a State Supreme Court justice sided with Mr. Johnson and ruled that he was a legal resident of Port Washington and could run in the race.</p>
        <p>But the charge may be sticking. As he campaigned in East Hills, amid the condolences for his mother's death and promises of votes on Tuesday, he also got this question from one man he stopped on the street: ''Are you the Johnson that lives in Manhattan?''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Johnson is favored slightly in the race, political analysts say the outcome is anyone's guess.</p>
        <p>Joseph N. Mondello, the chairman of the Nassau County Republican Party, made no secret of how difficult he expected the race to be when he announced the selection of Ms. Green. ''This is an uphill battle for us, no question,'' he said at the time, and since then he has flooded the district with volunteers distributing leaflets for her.</p>
        <p>The Democrats were planning to spend about $60,000 on the race, nearly three times as much as the Republicans said they would spend. Mr. Zwirn said he expected to spend  $10,000 to $12,000.</p>
        <p>''This will be a referendum on whether the troubles of the Republican machine have abated,'' said Dr. Herbert D. Rosenbaum, an emeritus professor of political science at Hofstra University. ''I would argue that the outcome hinges on the famous turnout question, which in local, off-season elections tends to be low. In this race, the well-organized campaign has a tremendous edge.''</p>
