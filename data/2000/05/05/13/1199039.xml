        <p>Teresa Brown carries a letter and a photograph in her pocketbook. The photograph is of her son, Patrick. The letter is from one of the five young men who killed him.</p>

        <p>Teresa Brown carries a letter and a photograph in her pocketbook. The photograph is of her son, Patrick. The letter is from one of the five young men who killed him.</p>
        <p>She has read the letter many times, but she cannot yet find an answer for the man who wrote it. He wants her forgiveness, her mercy, but she still must pass her son's empty bedroom each morning. She touches his picture on the wall with her lips and says hello. She tells him that she loves him and apologizes that he had to die so unfairly. No, she cannot answer that letter yet.</p>
        <p>''In order for me to see God, I've got to forgive him,'' she says. ''But right now it's hard.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Brown will not be among the tens of thousands of mothers gathering in Washington on this Mother's Day weekend for the Million Mom March against gun violence. She and other mothers who have lost children to violence here admit they know little about the demonstration. And they do not even agree with all the fine points of its message.</p>
        <p>But they do know a lot about murder. For few places offer a more sobering picture of murder in America than this gritty paper mill town in the Arkansas Delta.</p>
        <p>The murder rate here led the nation in 1997 and 1998. The local prosecuting attorney estimates that there are more guns than people. Unemployment is double the state average, and city officials are so desperate to stanch the falling population that they recently annexed nearby prison units with 1,500 inmates.</p>
        <p>The protesters in Washington are calling for ''sensible gun control,'' and mothers in Pine Bluff like Mrs. Brown would seem to be a sympathetic audience. But their responses are hardly predictable. Mrs. Brown's son was killed in 1998 during a weekend visit home from college, and she does support more gun restrictions.</p>
        <p>Lynda Carter, whose oldest son, Gabriel, was shot when someone fired indiscriminately into a crowded dance hall, supports gun licensing and registration. But she sounds like many gun control opponents when she says that the problem lies more with the person holding the gun than with the weapon itself.</p>
        <p>And Frankie Bishop Odom, whose son, Chris, was shot outside a bar here in 1997, also thinks guns should be licensed. But she doubts that doing so will prevent criminals from getting them.</p>
        <p>''I don't blame the mothers who want the handguns done away with, I don't blame them at all,'' Mrs. Odom said. But, she added, ''In this town, it's not a bad idea for you to have a gun.''</p>
        <p>So on Mother's Day, as protesters gather at the foot of the Capitol, Mrs. Brown will attend church. Mrs. Carter will spend the day with her husband and three other children. And Mrs. Odom will carry a single rose to her son's grave, which she visits every week, talking to his headstone, even though she knows she must look like a crazy lady whispering to a ghost.</p>
        <p>''The favorite word is closure,'' said Mrs. Odom, 46, who manages an apartment complex. ''I hate that word, because there's no such thing. You never have your life back. I go to bed thinking about it. I wake up thinking about it.''</p>
        <p>She once drove 40 miles to Little Rock to attend a support group for parents of murdered children, but never went inside. She sat in the parking lot, unable to will herself out of the car, so she drove back to Pine Bluff.</p>
        <p>She poured her energy into bringing her son's killer to justice. She wrote anonymous letters to the local newspaper when the case seemed stalled.</p>
        <p>When she feared prosecutors might negotiate a reduced sentence, she faxed them a homemade Christmas card with a picture of her son's grave. The killer got 40 years.</p>
        <p>The conviction brought her some relief, but it has not eased her loneliness. She still has her husband and her 14-year-old daughter, Catherine, but she and Chris, who was 23, talked about everything. Some nights, she says, she prays she will dream about him so they can talk again, and she can touch him. ''I ask people sometimes, 'Do you think I'm crazy?' '' she says.</p>
        <p>There is reason for some optimism in Pine Bluff. The city recorded 21  murders in 1996, then 19 in 1997 and 18 in 1998. None of these numbers would be startling for a large city, but Pine Bluff has only 57,000 residents within its city limits, and about 82,000 people in what officials call its metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>In 1998, the city was the nation's murder capital with a rate of 33.8 per 100,000 people, compared with a national average of 6.3. If New York had had a similar rate, the city would have recorded roughly 2,500 murders, far surpassing the 629 in 1998.</p>
        <p>But last year the number of murders dropped to eight, meaning the city will probably shed its unwanted murder capital designation when new statistics are released later this year. No one in Pine Bluff is certain, though, if last year's improvement is the start of a trend, particularly since the city has already recorded six homicides this year and remains plagued with stubborn social and economic problems.</p>
        <p>Only in recent years has the city begun to seriously address its homicide rate, said the Rev. Jesse Turner, a local Baptist preacher. In 1997, a coalition of ministers started a ''Respect for Life'' campaign to educate young people about violence. Recently, federal officials designated Pine Bluff for the Justice Department's ''Weed &amp; Seed'' antidrug program.</p>
        <p>''We let so many people get killed and don't say enough about it,'' Mr. Turner said. ''I think the outrage is just not there.''</p>
        <p>He added that ''because guns are prevalent, the only way the young people know how to solve a problem is with a gun.''</p>
        <p>Stevan B. Dalrymple, the local prosecuting attorney, said guns were part of the culture in Pine Bluff and surrounding Jefferson County. One local school district cancels classes for the first day of deer hunting season.</p>
        <p>Antique rifles and other hunting guns are often passed down for generations, and Mr. Dalrymple estimates that there are at least 100,000 guns in a county with a population of about 90,000.</p>
        <p>He is skeptical that new gun laws and restrictions will make any difference in reducing homicides, particularly since he says criminals often steal weapons rather than buy them.</p>
        <p>''I believe we have a law that covers every violation,'' he says, attributing the murder problem, in large part, to drugs, poverty and teenagers growing up without supervision. ''The biggest problem here is societal.''</p>
        <p>The range of homicides in Pine Bluff is much like the rest of the country. Most arise from either domestic disputes or botched armed robberies. Often, Mr. Dalrymple says, the shootings involve ''bad guys killing bad guys.'' But there also are innocents who die.</p>
        <p>Lynda Carter's son Gabriel Walker, 19, was a sophomore track star at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, the oldest of four children, with dreams of running in the Olympics. But on Nov. 1, 1998, he was dancing at a party of about 300 people when someone opened fire through a window. He was shot in the head.</p>
        <p>The authorities arrested a man and accused him of spraying the gunfire into the party after bouncers had ejected him for not paying a cover charge. A jury found the man not guilty.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Carter, 45, lives about 80 miles southwest of Pine Bluff, and she has taught Spanish in a rural public high school for nine years. But now she says she may quit.</p>
        <p>''The system is telling me my life and my son's life is worthless,'' she said. ''I send this love out to the world and they send it back to me in a box. Let the world know what a great person violence has taken from amongst us.''</p>
        <p>Joye D. Cook, the liaison between the prosecutor's office and families of victims, said support groups for parents of murder victims were ''hard to keep going'' in Pine Bluff, though not for lack of eligible parents. Some parents expect a trial and a conviction to bring resolution and peace, though Ms. Cook said that rarely happened.</p>
        <p>''Nobody ever gets over it,'' she said, ''and nothing is ever enough.''</p>
        <p>Teresa and O. D. Brown Jr. watched as all five of the young men involved in the shooting of their son, Patrick, were convicted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown is a retired junior high principal, and Mrs. Brown still teaches health at Pine Bluff High School, where Patrick was a star football player. She carries a picture of him from the day two years ago when he signed a scholarship for Grambling State University in Louisiana.</p>
        <p>He had come home with his girlfriend for a weekend in June 1998. A high school friend called and asked him to go to a party, then called again and again until Patrick, who was 20, agreed to drop by. Prosecutors say people were gambling and drinking at the party and that Patrick stayed for less than five minutes. But on his way out he was attacked by robbers and shot in the chest.</p>
        <p>''I just can't seem to shake it, and it doesn't seem real,'' said Mrs. Brown, 55.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Brown does not know Mrs. Odom or Mrs. Carter, but all three of the women know each other's stories. They read about killings across the country every day now in the newspapers. They watch the murder reports on the news.</p>
        <p>''I'm not the only one this is happening to,'' Mrs. Brown said. ''It's happening to other mothers, other kids. It's happening to good kids.''</p>
