        <p>Thomas P Melady letter praises Edward M Egan, New York's new Roman Catholic archbishop</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Archbishop-elect Edward M. Egan (front page, May 12) was always a leading candidate to be named archbishop of New York when the position became vacant. While serving as the United States ambassador to the Vatican I would hear his name.</p>
        <p>The new archbishop was known for his leadership. There was never any doubt that he was a leader, with all its implications. But more important was the respect that the Vatican leaders have for his knowledge of church traditions and culture. And most important, he is a first-class priest.</p>

        <p>He is fluent in Latin, Italian, French and Spanish, and his brilliance is matched by his interest in people. His success and responsibilities never interfered with the time he gave to people.</p>
