        <p>The Republican candidates for the United States Senate barely uttered an unneighborly word about one another in their debate on Monday. But with 25 days left until the June 6 primary, the knives have come out.</p>
        <p>State Senator William L. Gormley, who has raised more money than his three rivals but had spent little until this week, has begun a direct-mail campaign assailing the record and character of United States Representative Robert D. Franks. The other candidates are James W. Treffinger, the Essex County executive, and Murray Sabrin, a former candidate for governor.</p>
        <p>In two full-color advertisements, Mr. Gormley portrays himself as a tax-cutting conservative and Mr. Franks as an untrustworthy, big-spending tax raiser in fiscal conservative's clothing.</p>
        <p>The two ads seem lifted out of the pages of a supermarket tabloid. In one, Mr. Franks is rendered as some sort of two-headed alien. ''Doubly Dishonest,'' screams a headline.</p>
        <p>In another, a trim Mr. Gormley, shown head to toe, grins broadly next to a headline proclaiming his support for ''37 tax cuts.'' It brings to mind the kind of ad that might proclaim ''I lost 37 pounds!'' Among Mr. Gormley's specific claims about Mr. Franks are that the congressman ''flip-flopped on impeachment,'' by first voting in the House to impeach President Clinton and then signing a letter urging the Senate to approve a deal to censure the president instead.</p>
        <p>In faxes to supporters and reporters, the Franks campaign is responding by accusing Mr. Gormley of ''deceitful distortions and lies.'' For example, Mr. Gormley also claims Mr. Franks ''missed 2,600 votes'' as a state assemblyman from 1980 to 1992, ''but showed up to vote himself two pay raises.'' But Mr. Gormley voted for the same pay raises, said Charlie Smith, Mr. Franks's campaign manager. ''I find it inherently deceitful that someone would use against an opponent issues that they held the same position on,'' Mr. Smith said. He added that calling Mr. Franks cowardly and untrustworthy was ''over the line, beyond the pale of debate that should be happening in a Republican primary.''</p>
        <p>David J. Murray, a consultant for Mr. Gormley who specializes in direct mail, defended the two mailings,  saying, in effect, that Mr. Franks had started the attacks. He referred to mailings that the Franks campaign had sent to Bergen County Republicans weeks ago. In those mailings, Mr. Franks was described as a ''real Republican,'' and Mr. Gormley as a ''Florio Republican,'' insinuating that Mr. Gormley had been cozy with Jim Florio, a Democrat, during Mr. Florio's term as governor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murray also said that it was fair to fault Mr. Franks for raising the national debt as a congressman, though Mr. Franks notes that he later voted to reduce the debt by $1 trillion over five years. ''That's such hypocrisy, to say it's what I did last that matters,'' Mr. Murray said. ''You don't get to determine the statute of limitation on things.''</p>
        <p>The next Republican debate will be  May 22, and Mr. Smith hinted that it might be less congenial than Monday's initial encounter. ''I imagine there will be an effort by all the candidates to draw starker contrasts and engage their opponents in direct comparisons,'' he said.</p>
