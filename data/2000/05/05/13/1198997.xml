        <p>When leaders of the United Methodist Church gathered for their General Conference in Cleveland for the last two weeks, much attention focused on whether the denomination, the nation's largest mainline Protestant body, would modify its stands against ordaining gays and blessing same-sex unions. That did not happen, as delegates voted this week to retain those prohibitions.</p>
        <p>But the conference dealt with much else, like a symbolic action that could have a powerful effect beyond the bounds of the eight-million-member denomination. Yesterday, delegates voted overwhelmingly to amend the church's constitution to include a declaration against racism.</p>
        <p>The amendment, which would take effect if adopted within the next year by two-thirds of the church's conferences, its regional jurisdictions, called racism a sin. ''The United Methodist Church shall confront and seek to eliminate racism, whether in organizations or individuals, in every facet of its life and in society at large,'' the amendment said.</p>
        <p>Its adoption followed a service of repentance last week that made a formal apology for acts of racism by Methodists against African-Americans. Among those present to witness the event were representatives of three predominately black Methodist denominations, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church and the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church. The oldest is the African Methodist Episcopal Church, founded in 1816, several years after a group of black Methodists, alarmed at racial discrimination they encountered in a church in Philadelphia, withdrew to establish their own congregation.</p>
        <p>If the Methodist service could be described as an act of memory, it was one of several in recent weeks. On May 2, many Jews took time to reflect on the memory of the Holocaust, on a day -- Yom Hashoah -- set aside for that purpose.</p>
        <p>''If we remember the tragedy, we remember the victims,'' said Menachem Z. Rosensaft, a lawyer who serves on the council of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington and is the founding chairman of the International Network of Children of Jewish Holocaust Survivors. Mr. Rosensaft gave two speeches about the Holocaust that day.</p>
        <p>Two weeks earlier, he participated in a commemorative event at Bergen-Belsen in Germany, which was the site of a Nazi concentration camp and a place that after the war, when the area was administered by the British army, served as a temporary quarters for ''displaced persons.'' Mr. Rosensaft's parents, both Holocaust survivors, lived there after the German defeat; in 1946, his father unveiled a monument that remained at the site, bearing the inscription, ''Earth conceal not the blood shed on thee.''</p>
        <p>In his speech, Mr. Rosensaft said that as the generation of survivors passed away, responsibility for remembering the Holocaust would fall increasingly to their children and grandchildren. ''Until now,'' he said in an interview, ''the primary burden has been on the survivors, who had the actual memory. They told their experiences, and they were effectively the remembrance.''</p>
        <p>New generations must become responsible for the ''transmission of memory,'' to give life and texture to the historical accounts of the Holocaust and to rebut those who would deny that it happened, he said.</p>
        <p>''As children of survivors, I do not believe that we have any particular rights and privileges,'' Mr. Rosensaft said. ''We do have an obligation to ensure that the memory that we have received from our parents is passed on.''</p>
        <p>He mentioned, too, that, as the Holocaust museum's representative, he had traveled five years ago to Armenia, a nation that regained its independence after the collapse of the  Soviet Union in 1991. The occasion was a ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the massacres of Armenians by the armies of the Ottoman Empire, in what is now Turkey. Armenians have ever since referred to the killings as genocide.</p>
        <p>This year, a service of remembrance was held on April 24 in Manhattan at St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Cathedral, a site provided for the occasion by Cardinal John O'Connor, a few days before he died. Among those attending were a few elderly people who had survived the massacres as children, said Christopher H. Zakian, a spokesman for the Diocese of the Armenian Church of America.</p>
        <p>''It's true that it's 85 years out -- the genocide began in 1915,'' Mr. Zakian said. ''One of the themes was, this is probably the last major anniversary of the event at which elderly survivors will be able to participate.''</p>
        <p>Speakers at the service, he said, dwelled not just on the massacres, but also on the survival of Armenian communities abroad and the re-birth of an independent Armenian republic. The message was that what happened 85 years ago, he said, ''was the darkest episode in Armenian history, but we're still here.''</p>
        <p>At the diocese's cathedral in Manhattan, a stained glass window pays homage to the victims. It is an artist's portrayal of a famous passage in the biblical book Ezekiel in which God shows the prophet Ezekiel a valley of dry bones, asks him to prophesy over the remains, then restores the dead to life.</p>
        <p>''My generation,'' Mr. Zakian said, ''will always honor our grandparents for what they sacrificed, and what they suffered, and what they gave to us.''</p>
        <p>''We know the names of these people,'' he said, ''and always carry them in our hearts.''</p>
