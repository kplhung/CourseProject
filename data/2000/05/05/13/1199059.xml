        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The call by Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, for peacekeeping troops in Sierra Leone from former colonial forces is a sad but poignant sign that an imperialistic tradition dies hard.</p>
        <p>Would Mr. Annan's plea that ''the best peacekeeper is a well-trained soldier'' (front page, May 11) have applied as accurately to imperial British forces at the time of the 1950's independence movement, or for that matter to our own troops in scattered countries in the last century? Imperial nations were confident that they were bringing peace to an unstable continent.</p>

        <p>Should we intervene militarily? It may be the humane or even the most practical economic decision. But let's be careful -- with strategic moral judgments as well as with fighting troops.</p>
