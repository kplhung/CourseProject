        <p>The Republican Party leadership moved today to prevent an early conclusion to the presidential nominating process, recommending a system in which the smallest states would hold their primaries in February while the biggest states would have to wait until May.</p>
        <p>Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, praised the 36-to-13 vote by its Rules Committee, saying the move would ''make the presidential primary process more meaningful for more citizens'' than the ''media-driven, front-loaded campaign process that disenfranchises so many states and so many voters.''</p>

        <p>The Republican Party leadership moved today to prevent an early conclusion to the presidential nominating process, recommending a system in which the smallest states would hold their primaries in February while the biggest states would have to wait until May.</p>
        <p>Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, praised the 36-to-13 vote by its Rules Committee, saying the move would ''make the presidential primary process more meaningful for more citizens'' than the ''media-driven, front-loaded campaign process that disenfranchises so many states and so many voters.''</p>
        <p>Former Senator Bill Brock of Tennessee, who led a commission that devised the plan voted on today, said it was an opportunity ''to restore a sense of participation'' in politics.</p>
        <p>Morton Blackwell, a conservative from Virginia and member of the Rules Committee who usually opposes telling state parties what to do, said the plan ''is the only alternative that we have to a national primary that would be bad for our country and bad for our party.''</p>
        <p>The committee approved one change in the Brock plan, moving its March-through-June schedule of primaries to a February-through-May schedule.</p>
        <p>The revised plan, which the committee may still tinker with to build support, must next be approved by the national committee and then by the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia this summer. The first test may be easier; in the full national committee, as in its Rules Committee today, states have equal voting strength regardless of their populations.</p>
        <p>In the convention, populous states have more votes. But today's vote suggested that they might not have enough to defeat the plan. The states in opposition today will have 35 percent of the delegates in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the prospective presidential nominee, could probably ensure either victory or defeat for the plan at the national convention. But Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political strategist, said on Thursday that the governor would not take any stand, now or later.</p>
        <p>If the new plan clears those hurdles, several committee members said today, negotiations could begin with Democrats to agree on a plan that both parties could take to state legislatures, which set actual primary dates.</p>
        <p>Mike Hellon, a Rules Committee member from Arizona, said ''Democrats hate the system worse than we do'' and would ''probably embrace what we're doing'' eventually.</p>
        <p>Bill Jones, a committee member who is also the California secretary of state, said, ''The Democrats will come.''</p>
        <p>The formal position of Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign, and therefore that of the Democratic Party, is that the current system has brought Democrats victory in 1992 and 1996 and thus needs no change, especially one that might annoy one state party or another.</p>
        <p>Democrats, who led the efforts to change the nominating system in the 1970's, are now happy to let the Republicans assume that risk first. But, speaking on condition their names not be used, many Democratic operatives have suggested that if Republicans can ultimately agree among themselves, two-party talks are likely after this year's elections.</p>
        <p>For that to happen, however, a proposal adopted on Thursday to give the national committee the power to change the Republicans' rules between conventions would have to be passed in Philadelphia, and it is sure to draw strong opposition.</p>
        <p>One important issue the Republicans ducked today was whether to exempt New Hampshire, traditionally the nation's first primary state, from the new rule barring any primaries before the first Tuesday in February. New Hampshire would be allowed to vote then, but its influence would be diluted because so could 11 other states, as well as Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Virgin Islands and American Samoa.</p>
        <p>That issue, on which the Rules Committee appeared to be closely divided, was shelved until the committee meets in Philadelphia in July. The panel did decide that Iowa's Republican caucuses could be held in January, concluding that the presidential ''straw poll'' taken at the caucuses did not directly connect to the selection of convention delegates.</p>
        <p>Democratic rules specifically allow the contests in Iowa and New Hampshire to precede those of all the other states, which are forbidden to vote before March.</p>
        <p>Today's debate generally assumed that the present system, with states racing to get to the head of the primary line, produced low interest in later primaries. But representatives from most of the populous states that were allotted the later dates contended that even though they had almost half the delegates, the real choice would still be made before their residents got to vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones of California, who opposed the plan recommended today and preferred a system of regional primaries with a rotating right to go first, insisted that there was more than the calendar at work. He said the parties had a strong incentive to unite behind a candidate early and start fighting the other party.</p>
        <p>As a concession to that argument and to big states, the committee changed the dates in the Brock plan.</p>
        <p>Jan Staples of Maine, a lightly populated state that could vote in February, scoffed at the argument that late primaries would cost the big states influence.</p>
        <p>''The large states simply have too many delegates and too many electoral votes in the general election to become irrelevant,'' Ms. Staples said.</p>
        <p>William Powers, the Republican state chairman in New York, opposed the plan and tried to make its adoption conditional on Democratic agreement.</p>
        <p>''We can't tie our hands while theirs are free to choke us,'' Mr. Powers said.</p>
        <p>But David Norcross of New Jersey scorned that idea, saying, ''It cedes to the Democrats leadership on this issue.''</p>
        <p>John Mason of Nevada even argued that the more drawn-out schedule would lead to nicer campaigns. Knowing that the process this year would effectively be over by March 7, Mr. Mason said, Mr. Bush and his main rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona, had an incentive to try for ''a death stroke'' against each other.</p>
