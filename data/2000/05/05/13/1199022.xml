        <p>Pakistan's Supreme Court ruled today that last October's military coup was legal but set a three-year deadline on a return to civilian rule.</p>
        <p>The unanimous opinion of the 12-member court was that the overthrow of the government had been justified because of corrupt and ineffective ''one-man rule'' by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.</p>

        <p>Pakistan's Supreme Court ruled today that last October's military coup was legal but set a three-year deadline on a return to civilian rule.</p>
        <p>The unanimous opinion of the 12-member court was that the overthrow of the government had been justified because of corrupt and ineffective ''one-man rule'' by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.</p>
        <p>The decision was read by Chief Justice Ershad Hassan Khan, who, like the other judges, swore a loyalty oath to the military government two months ago, just before hearing arguments in the case.</p>
        <p>While endorsing the army's control for ''a transitional period,'' the court said: ''Prolonged interference of the military in politics is not good. It will politicize the army, and democracy should be restored within the shortest possible time.''</p>
        <p>The justices then set down a timetable, something Pakistan's new chief executive, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has refused to do. They gave the army three years to make political reforms, ordering that elections take place by early 2003.</p>
        <p>The court was ruling on several petitions against the legality of the Oct. 12 coup, including one by Mr. Sharif's party, the Pakistan Muslim League. Hours before the court's decision in Islamabad, Mr. Sharif went on trial for corruption in a 16th-century Mogul fort 50 miles away.</p>
        <p>He is charged with failing to note a helicopter purchase on his declaration of wealth and income tax returns. It is the first of several cases expected against Mr. Sharif by an  accountability bureau set up to recover money stolen from the state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharif was found guilty of hijacking and terrorism in April and was given a term of life in prison. While he is appealing, the government is asking for a reconsideration of the sentence, arguing that the death penalty is more appropriate.</p>
        <p>The deposed prime minister had been held in Karachi, but for his corruption case he was transferred to a cell in Attock Fort, headquarters for an army commando group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharif used the proceedings to complain that his accommodations were grim and his food rotten. He claimed to be a victim of psychological torture, but defiantly said, ''They will not be able to break my morale.''</p>
