        <p>The ball had hung above the rim for what seemed an eternity before dropping through the net. And as it descended, thousands of voices in the Madison Square Garden crowd cried in agony. On the floor, amid the stunned and shocked players, the official Dan Crawford started to wave the basket off.</p>
        <p>While all this was going on, Anthony Carter, who had unleashed the unlikely and acrobatic shot last night as he nearly fell into the first row along the baseline, into seats that might be out of the price range of the rookie point guard, pleaded quietly to himself.</p>
        <p>''I was saying, 'Please don't take my basket,' '' Carter said afterward. ''I was devastated for a minute. But luckily, one of the referees saw that Zo did not touch the ball. That was a breath of relief. It's one of the biggest shots of my career.''</p>
        <p>Carter hesitated and then added sheepishly: ''That is my biggest one. It's just the biggest. A situation like this, Madison Square Garden, the New York Knicks, and a shot we really needed.''</p>
        <p>Carter's presence on the floor was both unlikely and unbelievable. He had come to the Miami Heat out of the Continental Basketball Association, undrafted and unheralded.</p>
        <p>His game-winning shot with 2.2 seconds left -- off a daring drive along the baseline that was lofted over Patrick Ewing, maybe from behind the basket, before dangling precipitously as Alonzo Mourning pulled his fingers away as if the ball was on fire -- was the stuff of fiction.</p>
        <p>''It looked like it was going in, but it took a great bounce,'' Carter said of the shot that gave the Heat a 77-76 overtime victory in Game 3. ''I thought it was going to be all net, but I think Zo fanned the ball in for me. It was a close call and we got the benefit of the doubt.</p>
        <p>''Every now and then you play around with shots like that. I'm going to keep trying to make the shots like that. That's something I work on, but never coming out of the corner like that. It might be something I have to work on now. It felt good coming off the hand. It took a great bounce.''</p>
        <p>Told that there was some debate whether the shot had been launched from behind the basket, which would have been illegal, he said, ''You all are going to have to look at a replay and tell me, was I behind the backboard?''</p>
        <p>Carter entered the game with  5 minutes 57 seconds remaining in the third quarter, when Tim Hardaway's sprained left foot could support him no longer. Hardaway, who had returned to action for this series after sitting out the opening-round sweep of the Detroit Pistons, played just 18 minutes before surrendering to the pain. Asked after the game if he would be able to play in Game 4 tomorrow at the Garden, Hardaway said: ''I don't know. We'll see. It tightened up and was worse than in Game 2.''</p>
        <p>Hardaway was unable to contribute anything on the floor, scoring just a single point. And when Carter entered the game, the Heat was trailing by  7 points and the rookie seemed like raw meat being tossed to the ravenous crowd. But Carter, who started in Hardaway's place for 30 regular-season games and the entire first round, saw it differently.</p>
        <p>''That was the whole game plan, for somebody to step up,'' Carter said. ''I would love to have had Tim in there.''</p>
        <p>But with Carter on the floor, the Heat immediately put together an 18-8 run to take the lead, 60-57, with seven minutes remaining. He remained in the game as the lead shifted back and forth, and he missed a running shot just outside the lane with 25 seconds left in regulation that could have sealed the game.</p>
        <p>After Mourning tied the score and Patrick Ewing gave the Knicks a  1-point lead by making 1 of 2 from the line, Carter came up with the sort of shot that only Hardaway could have devised. But Hardaway could not have completed it last night. What he could do was step aside for a night, giving way to Carter. And while Hardaway spun and twisted with body English to aid him, Carter dropped in the most unlikely shot.</p>
        <p>''It was unbelievable,'' P. J. Brown said. ''But I'm not surprised to see him do it because A. C. is that type of guy. He works on his game, practices hard, and good things happen to good people. That was just an unbelievable shot.''</p>
        <p>Carter said: ''It's a great feeling to be out there. Knowing that coach has confidence in me in the fourth quarter, that helped.</p>
        <p>''I thought I did a great job in the fourth quarter and overtime. It means a lot to me just being out there with the guys in a situation like this.''</p>
