        <p>Patrick Ewing held up his shooting hand high, arching his wrist as if he were doing a King Tut impression or auditioning for the ''Walk Like an Egyptian'' video. When the shot fell through with 2.6 seconds remaining in regulation and Madison Square Garden became delirious and finally too loud to hear, the hand was still raised. He backpedaled downcourt that way, the longest follow through anyone could remember, maybe since Christian Laettner sank Kentucky in 1992.</p>
        <p>In overtime, a Ewing free throw bounded off the back rim and left the door open for Miami.</p>
        <p>Ecstasy. Agony. Patrick Ewing in orange and blue for the past 15 years.</p>
        <p>The implausible end to Game 3 last night, when the Big Fella brought them from the seats one moment and left every soul shaken the next, shuffling out into the breezy Manhattan night, muttering under their breath, ''If Patrick only makes the first with 13.7 seconds left . . .''</p>
        <p>Here they go again. The drama kings, led by their oft-cursed center, throwing back every advantage they gain in nearly every postseason they play.</p>
        <p>It's a hard, Knick life.</p>
        <p>Ewing was asked about this perpetual state of the franchise after the painful 77-76 loss, whether he feels the same way.</p>
        <p>''No, I mean, naturally I would have loved to have won the game, but we have never done anything easy around here,'' Ewing said. ''We have always had to push it to the limit. We just have to pick ourselves up and get ready for Sunday.''</p>
        <p>Ewing's picturesque 17-footer over an onrushing Alonzo Mourning tied the game and sent the Knicks into overtime, where New York looked in tremendous shape.</p>
        <p>But Mourning gathered himself, made a couple of tough jump shots. And Anthony Carter, that tree stump of a point guard who was playing pickup games in Atlanta only five years ago, made a near-impossible shot along the right baseline, lofting a runner high enough to go over the backboard, hit the front of the rim and bounce in, a H-O-R-S-E shot for the victory.</p>
        <p>Knick zealots will cry foul over the shot until Game 4 tomorrow, saying it should have been ruled illegal. But as one of the game officials said as he left the Garden last night, ''No one is saying anything if Pat doesn't miss the free throw.''</p>
        <p>After a botched out-of-bounds play on the Knicks' final possession, Ewing was left to ponder whether that miss could have been the difference. In a game of missed opportunities, his will be remembered most.</p>
        <p>Now a team that had a golden chance to go up 3-1 on its home floor is suddenly down to two losses in its season, its goal of returning to the finals flickering.</p>
        <p>Ewing will take the brunt of the fans' criticism, as always. From the people who groaned when the ball rolled off his foot. Who grimaced when one of his baseline fall-aways hit the backboard and never touched the rim.</p>
        <p>They won't remember that Ewing put them in position again last night,  made the shot that made it possible for them to win. Because then people would have to find another target, and well, he's been here the longest, so let's point the finger at Patrick. It's always his fault, no?</p>
        <p>Somehow, he's become the symbol of being so close yet so far away for the past 15 years.</p>
        <p>But that ruminating is for another day. If it's not him, it's always something with this team that never seems to handle prosperity well.</p>
        <p>You can make an argument the reason why the Knicks find themselves down two games to one to Miami in the Eastern Conference semifinals has less to do with Ewing's miss than with the lack of a killer instinct exhibited by their two most potent scorers.</p>
        <p>You may remember that Allan Houston had a chance to create some distance between the Knicks and the Heat last night. He could make Mourning rue the moment he picked up his third foul in 33 seconds midway through the third quarter. He could have given New York a decent head start on a series lead.</p>
        <p>He was standing on the right wing with less than six minutes left in the third, and his team had grabbed a seven-point lead. The ball had rotated around the perimeter, inside and then outside, until Houston found it in his hands in that familiar spot, a few inches behind the arc.</p>
        <p>If he made that shot, the Knick lead splurges to 52-42. In this mosh-pit series, 10 points is less a cushion than an insurmountable lead.</p>
        <p>But the ball hit the front of the rim and bounced away. He could not close the door on Miami.</p>
        <p>Sprewell was brilliant at times, taking the ball hard to the basket and getting to the free throw line as best he could. But with the Knicks waiting for him to take over, to assert himself during a binge, twice he took quick shots that barely grazed the rim and sent Miami the other way with momentum.</p>
        <p>Maybe Houston and Sprewell not yet one of those nail-in-the-coffin players, the assassins who spot up and knocks down the shot that just demoralizes a team long before the game is over.</p>
        <p>At any rate, if you're Reggie Miller, you've got to be feeling better and better about your chances about the finals.</p>
        <p>Ewing misses a clutch free throw. Houston and Sprewell can barely find a seam in the defense when it matters most.</p>
        <p>Ecstasy followed by agony.</p>
