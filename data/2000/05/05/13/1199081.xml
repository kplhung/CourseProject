        <p>And then there was one, and his name is Harold O. Levy.</p>
        <p>Four months after the Board of Education began a nationwide search for a new schools chancellor, the incumbent's last two competitors dropped out yesterday, just one day before they were to be interviewed by the Board of Education.</p>
        <p>The latest development suggests that -- barring any scandal, disaster or unexpected maneuver -- Mr. Levy, the interim chancellor, is all but certain to be kept on, probably as a permanent chancellor, although the votes have not been counted yet.</p>
        <p>The swing vote, that of Irving S. Hamer Jr., the Manhattan member of the board, has been promised to Mr. Levy, aides to C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, said yesterday. Last week, Mr. Hamer put himself forward as a surprise challenger to Mr. Levy, but he dropped out this week when it became clear that he could not win.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hamer's vote would give Mr. Levy the same 4-to-3 majority of the Board of Education that he had when he was appointed interim chancellor on Jan. 9.</p>
        <p>It was yet another twist in what has been one of the city's most unpredictable searches for a schools chancellor. When Mr. Levy was first appointed, the board president insisted that there was almost no chance he would become permanent chancellor.</p>
        <p>''It is a little strange,'' the president, William C. Thompson Jr., conceded yesterday. ''I don't think anybody could have predicted the job Harold has done. What started to occur around the city was a consensus. 'Why don't you keep him?' became the No. 1 question around town.''</p>
        <p>It remained unclear yesterday whether Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's two appointees to the board and the Staten Island delegate, who opposed Mr. Levy the first time around, would make the vote unanimous in the interest of consensus and compromise. The vote is scheduled to take place on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>One Giuliani appointee, Ninfa Segarra, said yesterday that they had not yet had time to meet and discuss the latest developments. On the other hand, she did not rule out voting for Mr. Levy. ''I need to discuss with him how he would handle the next step,'' she said of the mayor.</p>
        <p>Ms. Segarra complained that the board had ended up with what she called no choice, but the lament was more whimsical than bitter.</p>
        <p>''This is like 10 little Indians,'' she said. ''We've got one little Indian left.'' Then she added: ''See? I have some culture,'' an allusion to Mr. Levy's efforts to raise the cultural consciousness of his board by sending them poetry.</p>
        <p>Board members said they had not yet discussed how long a contract Mr. Levy might be offered, though one said that two years -- about what Rudy Crew got when he arrived in October 1995 -- sounded about right.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy, who is on leave from his job as a Citigroup executive, would not comment. Sunny Mindel, a spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani, did not return a telephone call seeking comment.</p>
        <p>Just last Thursday, the board announced the names of five candidates for chancellor who had been recruited by headhunters in a national search. But by Tuesday, three of them had withdrawn: Richard T. LaPointe, president of Laubach Literacy in Syracuse; Anthony J. Trujillo, an official at the National Center on Education and the Economy; and Joan P. Kowal, former superintendent of schools in Palm Beach County, Fla.</p>
        <p>Interviews were scheduled for today with Jerome Clark, the president of Bowie State University in Maryland, and James P. Gallagher, the president of Philadelphia University. But yesterday they, too, withdrew, said the board president. Mr. Gallagher issued a written statement saying he was flattered to have been considered.</p>
        <p>''It was a little bit of a domino effect,'' said Mr. Thompson, the board president. ''They said, 'Gee, if they're withdrawing, why are we staying in?' Finally, it was, 'I don't want to be the only one.' ''</p>
        <p>The chancellor's post became vacant in December, when Mr. Crew was ousted by a divided board. Board members complained that he had lost his commitment to the job after months of sparring with Mr. Giuliani over school vouchers, summer school and the management of the school system. The mayor's delegates joined with the Staten Island and Queens appointees to oust Dr. Crew.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy emerged almost overnight as a dark horse candidate for the interim post. He had no formal credentials in education, although he had served on the State Board of Regents and on a commission looking at the city's crumbling school buildings.</p>
        <p>After his interim appointment, Mr. Levy made a quick impression as a strong manager -- ironically, with the kind of business approach that Mr. Giuliani had advocated -- but the mayor remained somewhat cool to him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson said that the board ultimately spent a bit less than the $165,000 it had budgeted for the search, but that he did not know how much less.</p>
