      <block class="full_text">
        <p>A small Colorado publisher yesterday agreed to a $1 million settlement in a libel suit brought by two car dealers from Northern Ireland who were accused in a book of belonging to a secret ruling committee of Protestant terrorists.</p>
        <p>Sean McPhilemy, the author of ''The Committee: Political Assassination in Northern Ireland,'' and his publisher, Roberts Rinehart, also agreed to issue a carefully worded statement that was read in Washington Superior Court, where lawyers were preparing to select a jury for the trial.</p>
        <p>In that document, they expressed regret for the embarrassment suffered by the car dealers, the brothers David and Albert Wesley Prentice, and conceded that they accepted that the two businessmen ''are not and have never been members of a secret committee as described in the hardback and paperback editions of the work.''</p>
        <p>The Prentices' lawsuit had sought $100 million in damages, but settlement discussions grew more earnest late this week when it became apparent that Mr. McPhilemy's chief source of information about a secret terrorist committee had decided to testify for the brothers.</p>
        <p>The source was James Alfred Sands, who was the only direct witness to provide information on tape to Mr. McPhilemy detailing the committee's structure, meeting place and members. He later recanted after Mr. McPhilemy's documentary on the same topic was shown on British television in 1991. Then Mr. Sands reversed himself, saying his recantation was made because he had received death threats, and then he changed his view once again, ultimately saying that he had provided information to Mr. McPhilemy as a joke.</p>
        <p>''I don't know why they hadn't settled before,'' said William W. Taylor, the lawyer for the Prentices. ''I think you have to assume that the critical part for the defendant was the admission and statement of regret.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor considers that statement a formal apology, but on this issue there is still disagreement. Russell Smith, a lawyer for Roberts Rinehart, said that the expression of regret is not an actual apology.</p>
        <p>''I don't think that Sean concedes that he did anything wrong,'' Mr. Smith said. ''He was doing his job as a journalist, and you don't always get it right. And he reported accurately what his source said. And his source, Jim Sands, has turned to the other side. And that's the only witness he had.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith added that Mr. McPhilemy still believed that a secret committee existed. But he said the author and his publisher decided to settle for several reasons, including Mr. Sands's decision to testify for the Prentices.</p>
        <p>''What also really triggered it was a breakthrough in the peace agreement for Northern Ireland,'' Mr. Smith said. ''It also seemed like an anachronism to fight all the battles of Northern Ireland in this courtroom. If the I.R.A. and the British government decided to bury the hatchet, why can't we?''</p>
        <p>The $1 million is to be paid to the Prentices by the publisher's insurance carrier. The amount could grow by more than $500,000 if the Prentices can prove at arbitration that a second libel insurance policy carried by Roberts Rinehart applied to the paperback version of ''The Committee,'' which was issued in 1998.</p>
