        <p>Three hundred Jordanian peacekeepers arrived in Sierra Leone today, and 100 United Nations civilian employees who had been evacuated returned to Freetown, as the threat to the capital receded and pro-government forces prepared to push rebels farther east.</p>
        <p>''The conditions now warrant their return,'' David Wimhurst, the spokesman for the United Nations force here, said of the employees who had left for Gambia when a rebel assault on Freetown seemed imminent this week. ''The security conditions have stabilized here.''</p>
        <p>A coalition made up of Sierra Leonean soldiers, former soldiers and militiamen, as well as the United Nations force and an increasing number of British troops, continued to strengthen in its opposition to the rebel Revolutionary United Front. The coalition's leaders were expected to meet for the first time tonight at the United Nations headquarters here in western Freetown.</p>
        <p>Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, the leader of a 1997 junta who is now allied with the government, said his men and his allies would repel the rebels as far east as possible in the next few days.</p>
        <p>''Then we need to get back to the drawing board,'' Colonel Koroma said of negotiating with the rebels and their leader, Foday Sankoh, whose whereabouts remained unknown. ''You can't finish off a guerrilla force.''</p>
        <p>Thousands of people gathered in the national stadium here in the capital today for the funeral of 19 civilians who were killed on Monday outside Mr. Sankoh's house.</p>
        <p>''Never again will we let one man destroy our country,'' President  Ahmed Tejan Kabbah said at the stadium.</p>
        <p>The 19, who had been taking part in a march for peace, were killed after United Nations peacekeepers were unable to control the crowd surging onto Mr. Sankoh's compound and his bodyguards opened fire. Mr. Sankoh vanished shortly after the violence.</p>
        <p>The Jordanians' arrival increased the United Nations force to 9,000, though 500 remained hostages of the rebels. More troops from Jordan, India and Bangladesh are expected eventually to bring the force to the  11,000 authorized by the Security Council. The rebels are thought to number about 15,000.</p>
        <p>In recent days, British troops have been visibly expanding their military role here. The British have sent ambiguous signals as to their role in Sierra Leone, their former colony; officially, it is limited to evacuating Europeans and offering technical assistance to the United Nations force.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Prime Minister Tony Blair said British troops would have no combat role. But he added that they might remain here for as long as one month to help the United Nations build up its force.</p>
