        <p>The Pentagon and a bipartisan group of senators today criticized legislation that sets a deadline for withdrawing American ground troops from Kosovo, warning that the measure would undermine the NATO operation and embolden President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a provision to cut off financing for the troops after July 1, 2001, unless the next administration wins specific approval from Congress. The measure is attached to a military  construction spending bill that goes before the Senate for a vote on  Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The legislation underscores the growing unease on Capitol Hill over America's open-ended commitment to the Kosovo peacekeeping mission, where 5,900 United States troops are serving as part of a NATO operation.</p>
        <p>Today, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen warned in a letter that the provision ''is counterproductive to peace in Kosovo and will seriously jeopardize the relationship between the U.S. and our NATO allies.''</p>
        <p>In the letter to Senator Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican who heads the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Cohen said that if the Kosovo language stayed in the bill he  would recommend that President Clinton veto the legislation, even though it would reimburse the Pentagon for its expenses in Kosovo and pay for several important military construction projects.</p>
        <p>Separately, 11 Republican and Democratic senators sent a letter to the Senate Republican and Democratic leaders, Trent Lott and Tom Daschle, echoing Mr. Cohen's warnings. ''Enactment of this Kosovo provision would send the message to NATO that the United States is an unreliable ally, to Slobodan Milosevic that the United States is irresolute,'' the senators said.</p>
        <p>Gen. Wesley K. Clark, who commanded the allied air campaign against Yugoslavia last spring and who stepped down as the NATO military commander this month, also opposes the provision.</p>
        <p>''These measures would invalidate the policies, commitments and trust of our allies in NATO, undercut U.S. leadership worldwide, and encourage renewed ethnic tension, fighting and instability in the Balkans,'' General Clark said in a letter this week to Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee.</p>
        <p>The measure's two main sponsors, Senators John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, and Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, say the bill does not apply to American troops providing intelligence, surveillance or headquarters support.  They say they are merely exercising Congress's power of the purse.</p>
        <p>The measure, which was approved in committee 23 to 3 in a bipartisan vote, would also require the White House to begin planning with European allies in advance of the American withdrawal. The amendment would also withhold some Kosovo financing unless President Clinton certified by July 15 that the European allies were meeting their commitments for aid and reconstruction.</p>
        <p>Senate opponents of the provision stalled a final floor vote on the bill until Tuesday afternoon, giving the administration time to marshal what is expected to be a fierce lobbying campaign next week. The House rejected similar legislation in March.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Mr. Cohen, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and perhaps Gen. Joseph Ralston, the new NATO military commander, are expected to address the senators' regular policy luncheon.</p>
