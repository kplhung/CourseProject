        <p>With Britain's automotive industry swinging from crisis to crisis, the Ford Motor Company announced today that it would close its biggest car assembly plant in this country by early 2002 with a loss of 1,900 jobs.</p>
        <p>Ford attributed the move to what it called the company's ''totally unacceptable'' financial performance in the whole of Europe. Nick Scheele, the company's chairman for Europe, said Ford's plants in Britain, Germany, Spain and Belgium had the capacity to produce 2.2 million cars last year, but sold only 1.65 million, earning only $28 million on sales of $30 billion.</p>

        <p>With Britain's automotive industry swinging from crisis to crisis, the Ford Motor Company announced today that it would close its biggest car assembly plant in this country by early 2002 with a loss of 1,900 jobs.</p>
        <p>Ford attributed the move to what it called the company's ''totally unacceptable'' financial performance in the whole of Europe. Nick Scheele, the company's chairman for Europe, said Ford's plants in Britain, Germany, Spain and Belgium had the capacity to produce 2.2 million cars last year, but sold only 1.65 million, earning only $28 million on sales of $30 billion.</p>
        <p>But, the corporate picture offered by the car giant was immediately challenged by both labor unions and workers in what has become a familiar pageant played to television cameras at Britain's auto plants -- particularly since BMW of Germany announced it was shedding its Rover Cars subsidiary earlier this year.</p>
        <p>Outside Gate 34 of Ford's assembly plant in this working-class settlement east of London, Steve Johnston, 42, said that after 23 years of working for Ford here, he had one question: ''Why Dagenham? We were told we were the most efficient in Europe. We are cheaper to hire than the German worker. But we are the easiest to sack because there's no legislation to protect us.''</p>
        <p>Jimmy Maddox, 51, with 31 years at Ford, expressed similar anger, saying Ford's workers felt they had gone from management assurances about their future to bleak prospects.</p>
        <p>''Last year we were the bee's knees; now we're the poor relations,'' Mr. Maddox said. ''They can wipe us out just like that.''</p>
        <p>After weeks of uncertainty about Ford's plans, some workers said they were still unsure how the layoffs would work out.</p>
        <p>''We want to know firsthand what's happening,'' said Gengiz Osman, 36. And Peter Singh, a shop-floor labor leader, accused Ford of breaking a 1997 agreement to produce a new generation of the Fiesta subcompact at Dagenham -- Ford's biggest plant in Britain.</p>
        <p>Instead, Ford said today, the car plant here would close when the planned production run of Fiestas ends in early 2002. A new Fiesta is expected to be built in Cologne, Germany.</p>
        <p>''We had one assembly plant too many and it was a question of which one we would have to close,'' Mr. Scheele, Ford's European chairman, told a news conference at the Waldorf Hotel in central London. ''We require higher levels of manufacturing flexibility than in the past and Dagenham does not have the infrastructure in place, but Cologne does.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, he said, Ford would invest $500 million to expand a diesel engine factory here, making Dagenham its global diesel engine center and creating about 500 new jobs to offset the 1,900 to be lost in  car assembly.</p>
        <p>Ford's announcement came only four days after BMW agreed to sell its Rover subsidiary in Birmingham to a local consortium for a symbolic $:10 -- around $15. Parodying that deal, workers hung a placard on the Dagenham plant today proclaiming: ''To Let. $:10 o.n.o.'' (meaning ''or near offer'').</p>
        <p>But while BMW's disastrous six-year investment at Rover faltered over issues including productivity and the strength of the British pound, Ford depicted its problems at Dagenham as part of a far wider European auto industry malaise. Those uncertainties seemed reinforced today when the European Automobile Manufacturers Association in Brussels said new-car sales in Western Europe fell 7 percent in April, largely because many Germans were buying used cars instead of new ones. Ford was hardest hit with sales falling 17.7 percent.</p>
        <p>And, while European new-car sales reached a record 15.1 million vehicles last year, Ford's share of the market slipped to 9.09 percent from 9.87 percent in 1998.</p>
        <p>Ford, which says its European restructuring will save about $1 billion a year, also announced today that it would close a plant in Belarus. The measures are part of a months-long overhaul of Ford's European operations which has already led to the sale of a plant in Portugal, the closing of a plant in Poland and other measures including the introduction of single-shift work here, which was announced earlier this year and caused the loss of 1,350 jobs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scheele said Ford planned to introduce nine models a year -- up from three -- and would offer generous packages worth up to $100,000 for each worker leaving the company voluntarily. Over all, Ford said it would invest $3 billion at its British plants over the next five years.</p>
        <p>Ford has coupled its restructuring with a raft of acquisitions in Europe. It now owns the Jaguar and Aston Martin luxury cars of Britain and  Volvo of Sweden. Most recently, it agreed to pay $2.9 billion for BMW's Land Rover sport utility vehicles.</p>
        <p>While auto industry analysts broadly welcomed Ford's announcement, British labor leaders -- who say job losses will in reality be up to 5,000, much higher than Ford has announced -- refused to rule out disruptive action to press Ford to keep Dagenham as an assembly plant.</p>
        <p>''We are very angry and will do all we can to reverse their decision,'' said Sir Ken Jackson of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union.</p>
