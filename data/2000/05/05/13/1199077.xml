        <p>There is always a fighter who thinks he knows the secret to beating Roy Jones Jr., the undisputed light-heavyweight champion. Before they step into the ring, opponents pick him apart, looking for weaknesses that are not really there. Younger opponents think they can take advantage of his age (31), taller boxers his height (5 feet 11 inches) and stronger combatants his relatively slight frame.</p>
        <p>They all say he is only human. They all say he can be beaten. Then they step into the ring and, usually, crumble to the canvas after several blows from the fastest hands in the sport.</p>

        <p>There is always a fighter who thinks he knows the secret to beating Roy Jones Jr., the undisputed light-heavyweight champion. Before they step into the ring, opponents pick him apart, looking for weaknesses that are not really there. Younger opponents think they can take advantage of his age (31), taller boxers his height (5 feet 11 inches) and stronger combatants his relatively slight frame.</p>
        <p>They all say he is only human. They all say he can be beaten. Then they step into the ring and, usually, crumble to the canvas after several blows from the fastest hands in the sport.</p>
        <p>Now it is the turn of the No. 1 contender Richard Hall to tell the world he has the recipe to beat Jones. The two men will meet at the Conseco Field House on Saturday night. It is the first title fight in Indiana since 1986, when Marvin Johnson won his third light-heavyweight title at Market Square Arena.</p>
        <p>Jones is putting his three titles on the line -- the International Boxing Federation, the World Boxing Council and the World Boxing Association belts -- against Hall, the W.B.A.'s No. 1 challenger.</p>
        <p>''Jones better come strong,'' Hall said, ''because I will not be a walkover.''</p>
        <p>Jones has heard challenges like that before, but there is a reason he is 41-1. He is the best light-heavyweight in the world, and the threats of beating him are usually empty.</p>
        <p>Few give Hall a chance against Jones, even though Hall does present matchup problems. Hall is almost 4 inches taller than Jones, with a reach of 77 inches, meaning he can jab Jones from a distance. Hall, like Jones, has good power in both hands.</p>
        <p>Hall (24-1, 23 knockouts) has a resume worthy of a top contender. He wanted to become a boxer after watching the Ray Leonard-Marvin Hagler middleweight title bout in 1987. Hall came to the United States nine years ago after a successful stint as an amateur in Jamaica, where he won two Jamaican Golden Glove titles. After turning professional in 1993, he won his first 17 fights.</p>
        <p>A match like this always looks good on paper, but once a fighter goes against Jones, the paper crumples like so much confetti. Besides his athletic gifts, Jones has a tremendous work ethic and is an extremely skilled boxer. He can throw all punches with equal grace, as well as out-think his opponents.</p>
        <p>He is also hungry. And that may be his greatest achievement. Few athletes, in any sport, can maintain the kind of excellence Jones has for so long. ''I'm not ready to be denounced just yet,'' Jones said. ''When my time comes on Saturday, I'm coming to close the show.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''Richard Hall is a tough guy. He's a strong puncher. I know he's going to come out to try and knock me out because that's his main thing: his power. But I'm very powerful. I love a challenge.''</p>
