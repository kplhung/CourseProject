        <p>In the 1970's, when I first began working as an anthropologist in the Kono diamond mining district that is now the center of the rebel-held territory in Sierra Leone, I attended the trial of an old Kono chief. Men in red berets and red T-shirts intimidated the chief's supporters and witnesses and surrounded the open-air court. Although the official charges covered an assortment of crimes including murder and cannibalism -- not one of which this local court actually had the jurisdiction to hear -- the real issue was diamonds.</p>
        <p>It was understood by all that the chief had probably been profiting from illegal diamond mining. In the end, the charges were dropped, and I was told he had agreed to approve licenses for pro-government miners.</p>
        <p>Today, Kono's diamonds finance the arms and munitions of the Revolutionary United Front, the rebel group now holding 500 United Nations peacekeepers hostage. The question I expected to pursue in my days in Sierra Leone was how a country so endowed with the wealth of nations could be so impoverished. What I learned instead -- and Sierra Leoneans continue to learn as the R.U.F. wages its brutal fight against the country's legal authorities -- is how a legacy of lawlessness and predation can break a society.</p>
        <p>When diamonds were discovered in Kono in 1930, the British colonial government tried to seal off the region and made diamond mining illegal except for government-sponsored private monopolies and a few small licensing schemes, with most of the wealth leaving the country. In Sierra Leone, however, the diamonds are not embedded deep underground, but widely scattered in rivers and streams, making it impossible to bar access to them completely.</p>
        <p>Illegal digging of diamonds by both the Kono and migrants from elsewhere in Africa became the norm and remains so today. I never saw any stigma attached to it.</p>
        <p>Nearly every night during my field work, I saw the diggers who penetrated the diamond fields, although the vast majority remained poor. Many worked for ''arrangement masters'' who had the money to bribe security guards and provide the gasoline-operated pumps for draining watery areas for digging. Others ventured out on their own, using shovels, pails and sifters.</p>
        <p>It has been estimated that in some years in the 1950's and 60's, illegal mining in Sierra Leone may have accounted for as much as 20 percent of the world's diamond production, though now the diamonds are a dwindling resource. Legal mining, usually by international companies working on contract, has also continued since independence, under a succession of weak democratic governments, one-party states and military regimes.</p>
        <p>As the major source of foreign exchange, diamonds are crucial to the country's development, but with leaders continually corrupted by bribes and illegal profiteering, Sierra Leone's progress was slow even before civil war began reversing it.</p>
        <p>The current lawlessness is a result of more than a half-century of weak governments and a national preoccupation with controlling the diamonds by force. Annual roundups of migrants -- so-called stranger drives -- began in the colonial era and continued through independence.</p>
        <p>The white mercenaries who guarded the diamonds under the British were succeeded by the Sierra Leone army and police, which were often abusive. In 1995 the Sierra Leone government employed another private army, a company called Executive Outcomes, to drive rebels out of parts of the diamond fields.</p>
        <p>British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook was right on the mark when he said this week that it was the peacekeepers' moves toward the diamond fields that set off the latest round of warfare. There is no reason to believe that the rebels, who captured the fields in 1992, will surrender this without a fight.</p>
        <p>But brutal as these rebels are, their rule is only the latest manifestation of the violence and disorder that mismanagement of Sierra Leone's greatest resource has engendered from colonial times. Every government of the country has had a hand in creating today's war.</p>
