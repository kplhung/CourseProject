        <p>Fourteen years and a world of experience separate Mozart's Symphony No. 28, composed in 1773 when he was a 17-year-old prodigy, and his Symphony No. 38, composed in 1787 when he was 31 and at the height of his powers, with only four years left to live. The earlier work breathes with the innocent playfulness of Classical courtliness. The later one rides a wave of high drama, picked up both in the opera house and perhaps also reflecting personal turmoil.</p>
        <p>Sir Colin Davis used these two works to framed his all-Mozart program with the New York Philharmonic on Thursday evening at Avery Fisher Hall, and for all their differences he made them symmetrical bookends. It was an illusion, but what made it work was that Mozart used the same structural trick -- an alternation of intimacy and grandeur -- in the opening movement of the 28th and the finale of the 38th.</p>
        <p>For the most part, this was a concert that didn't go out of its way to pursue a themeIt mainly asked to be enjoyed. But the symphonies, as well as Alfred Brendel's reading of the Concerto No. 22, which came between them, touched on the shadows of Mozart's journey.</p>
        <p>Perhaps they undervalued the Symphony No. 28. At first, the strings were slightly unruly, and the reduced orchestra seemed out of its element. They offered neither the super-polished Mozart of, say, the Vienna Philharmonic or the bright, sharp edges of a period instrument band. But Sir Colin's impulses were carefully considered, and by imposing crisp dynamics and a sense of how insistently this music veers toward dance -- not only in the Menuetto, where one would expect that, but in the Andante as well -- he drew an energetic and  likable performance.</p>
        <p>In the Symphony No. 38, the players needed no special coaxing: they played it at full power, with beautifully blended contributions from the winds and some superb string playing. Sir Colin's contribution here was largely in pacing, and in that regard he was at his most magical in the Adagio opening of the first movement, where he made time seem to expand without letting the music lose its structure or coherence.</p>
        <p>In the Concerto, Mr. Brendel was every bit Sir Colin's match in moving beyond the strictures of the page. The performance, like that of the later symphony, stressed the links between this abstract music and Mozart's operas, and in the solo line, Mr. Brendel was something of a chameleon. When the music sang -- as it does in the Andante, but also in parts of the outer movements -- he played with an almost vocal fluidity. But when the line morphed into the purely pianistic and the quasi-orchestral, Mr. Brendel changed his coloration and phrasing to suit it. He also played his own cadenzas.</p>
