        <p>When it comes to sex, who decides what constitutes normal? Who decides what's too little and who says what's too much? For years, sociologists, psychologists and other experts have charted the continual shifts in sexual attitudes and practices. Now, two feminist historians are trying to upend conventional assumptions about sex, one of them studying celibacy, the other nymphomania.</p>
        <p>Consider, for example, ideas about whether men or women have the stronger sex drive. Carol Groneman, a history professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York, and Elizabeth Abbott, dean of women at Trinity College at the University of Toronto, agree that the notion that men are by nature more highly sexed than women is a fairly recent one. In the classical world, women were seen as the highly sexed ones. Ms. Abbott, whose book, ''A History of Celibacy'' (Scribner) is being published this month, cites the myth of Teiresias. Having been male and female, Teiresias was asked by Zeus and Hera to settle their argument as to who had most pleasure in sex. Women did, he re- plied; they experienced nine-tenths of the pleasure of intercourse, and men only one-tenth.</p>
        <p>The early Christians inherited the Roman idea that women were carnal creatures, Ms. Abbott writes. Although celibacy was at the center of Christianity (as with many religions), celibacy outside the church was suspect. In the 14th century, the ecclesiastical authorities crushed the Beguinage move- ment, in which women chose celibacy to minister to the needy but lived outside the cloister. Church fathers, she says, believed that ''women are weak and are temptresses, and if they are not locked up behind walls and monitored, they're constitutionally incapable of maintaining vows of celibacy.''.</p>
        <p>Ms. Groneman, whose book ''Nymphomania: A History'' (W. W. Norton) is due out in August, says that in the United States the idea that men have a stronger sex drive than women came into being only in the 19th century. The shift was connected to the egalitarian promise of the French and American Revolutions, she said. The notion that human beings are born with inalienable rights had to be reconciled with the fact that women could not vote and did not have equal property rights. So the ideal of the ''passionless'' woman, who was ''the angel of the house,'' was born as a rationalization for preserving the traditional hierarchy. ''From this exalted position, her unique role in the new republic would be to tame men's passions and maintain the purity of the home,'' Ms. Groneman writes.</p>
        <p>As for definitions of sexual normalcy, Ms. Groneman says that doctors - traditionally men - became the arbiters. ''They weighed in with their understanding that women's too delicate nervous system, monthly 'illness' and smaller brain, as well as their reproductive organs, all made it unhealthy for them to vote, work outside the home, write books, go to college or participate in the public arena.''</p>
        <p>As medicine became professionalized, too much sexual desire in women became a ''disease.'' The cures were drastic. Ms. Groneman cites an 1841 article in The Bos- ton Medical and Surgical Journal about a ''Miss T.'' who exhibited uncontrolled ''libidinous feelings.'' When doctors examined Miss T. vaginally, they determined that she bore the signs of ''nymphomania,'' including an enlarged uterus and genitalia. So they bled her, applied caustics to her genitals and prescribed cold-water douches.</p>
        <p>Indeed, doctors used the term ''nymphomaniac'' to describe a wide range of behavior, including women who confessed to having sexual dreams and to asylum inmates who tore off their clothes and masturbated. From the 1870's, doctors regularly performed ovariotomies and even, in a few instances, clitorodectomies to cure it. Until the 1990's, Ms. Groneman writes, nymphomania was admitted into court during rape trials as evidence, the theory being that the female victim ''wanted'' sex.</p>
        <p>A persistent theme in histories of sexuality is the link between sex and power. As Ms. Groneman and Ms. Abbott show, women discovered they could achieve power by withholding their sexuality, or by strategically using it.</p>
        <p>Ms. Abbott argues that to gain power, women and men have often had to sacrifice their sexuality. For example, the vestal virgins of Rome took 30-year vows of celi- bacy in return for their elevated status and legal independence.</p>
        <p>Later, she writes, Christian women ''recast the misogynist bachelor world of the Church Fathers into a splendid, challenging one where virgins were honorable and could also be powerful, and where God's love empowered the humblest women.''</p>
        <p>At the beginning of the sixth century, upper-class women who gave up sex and marriage could be abbesses in convents, and thus could study and administer prop- erty. Celibacy signified ''they're not going to be a challenge,'' Ms. Abbott said in an interview, and above all, would not bear sons on whose behalf they might conspire to gain property.</p>
        <p>In ancient China, males were forcibly castrated, sometimes as punishment for seducing unmarried women, and then trained to work in the imperial palace. But records show that by the 17th century, Chinese men were voluntarily submitting to castration in a desperate desire to escape poverty and gain civil service positions.</p>
        <p>Another reason for male celibacy has been the equation of semen with the life force. That concept drove the male purity movement of 1830's America, which coincided with increasing social mobility and the decline of parental control over sons. Celibacy became a form of social control, and was thought to curb excesses like masturbation that could lead to a depletion of energy and potency. Sylvester Graham, a founder of the movement, invented the Graham cracker, and Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, another advocate of celibacy, created his breakfast cereal as aids in curbing lust. There is also a long tradition of athletes foregoing sex before sports events to conserve power and energy.</p>
        <p>Ms. Abbott says she found herself ''intensely moved'' by accounts of people who have chosen celibacy to devote their energies to art, literature and science. Divorced twice and with a grown son, she decided to give up sex herself. ''I realized that at this stage in my life, I value even more the independence and serenity chaste solitude brings me,'' she writes in her book.</p>
        <p>If celibacy has been used as a tactic to gain more independence, sexual freedom has also been a central tenet of the women's movement. It was at the turn of the century, when women were campaigning for equal rights and birth control devices were more widely distributed that the concept of sexual compatibility in marriage first became popular. Freud proclaimed the centrality of sex, and the experts declared that women should enjoy it. Theodore Van de Velde's popular 1926 advice book, ''Ideal Marriage,'' decreed that married women should experience ''a fully equal and reciprocal share in love making.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Ms. Groneman points out, women's sexuality occupied a very narrow band.</p>
        <p>On the one hand, the term ''frigidity'' became popular, indicating a concern that women achieve sexual pleasure with their husbands. On the other, a woman was expected to be the ''passive'' recipient of the orgasm ''given'' her by her husband. Women who exhibited a greater sexual drive than their husbands, or not enough desire, were seen as abnormal or deviant.</p>
        <p>Today, in the post-sexual revolution, Ms. Groneman says, nymphomania has been replaced by ''sex addict'' or ''love addict'' - the last phrase more commonly used in popular literature in connection with women.</p>
        <p>The implication, in some quarters at least, is that sexual desire in wom- en is still seen as a sickness, with the ''love addict'' as a ''codependent,'' giving sex to get love, or because of a childhood trauma of sexual abuse.</p>
        <p>But ''love addict'' is as simplistic and misleading as ''nymphomaniac,'' says Ms. Groneman. They are new names for an old idea, but the same old stereotypes are at work. As she says, the questions ''How much is too much? How much is enough? And who decides? have still not been satisfactorily answered.</p>
