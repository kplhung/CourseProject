        <p>Temple won its opening heat in the men's varsity heavyweight eights as the 62nd annual Dad Vail Regatta began in Philadelphia yesterday.</p>
        <p>Temple has won the featured O'Brien eights trophy 11 straight years and 16 times since 1983. Its only loss came in 1988, when Florida Institute of Technology won.</p>
        <p>All of Temple's victories have come under Coach Gavin White. For the last three years, the senior Jason Read has stroked the Temple eight and he is hoping to end his Dad Vail career with a fourth gold medal.</p>
        <p>But Temple has been inconsistent this year. ''They'll go out and have an excellent race, and the next outing they'll be off,'' White said. ''It's been an up-and-down season. They won the Big East championships two weeks ago but will have to get by Michigan and St. Joe's to win this year.''</p>
        <p>Temple's crosstown rival St. Joseph's turned in the fastest qualifying time of the day on the 2,000-meter Schuylkill course, 5 minutes 48.43 seconds. St. Joseph's has been snapping at Temple's Dad Vail heels, placing second last year to the Owls by 3.3 seconds.</p>
        <p>Purdue also won its heat yesterday, in 5:51.41, to advance to this morning's semifinals, along with Michigan and Dowling of Long Island.</p>
