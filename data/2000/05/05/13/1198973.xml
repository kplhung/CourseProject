        <p>Jacquelyn Buglisi has a wondrously extravagant streak in her choreography, which is sharp and clear in its penetrating images. Donlin Foreman opts for passionate lyricism in his dances: he is not afraid of lushness, in movement quality and poetic ideas.</p>
        <p>''Red Hills,'' the Buglisi solo that opened the Buglisi/Foreman Dance  program on Sunday at the John Jay Theater, was inspired by Georgia O'Keeffe and had Christine Dakin as the O'Keeffe figure wandering through her own painting. The aura was indeed painterly, an essence captured strikingly by Jennifer DePalo in layers of red skirts. It was all roll and flow, matching the turbulence of the accompanying Liszt music.</p>

        <p>Jacquelyn Buglisi has a wondrously extravagant streak in her choreography, which is sharp and clear in its penetrating images. Donlin Foreman opts for passionate lyricism in his dances: he is not afraid of lushness, in movement quality and poetic ideas.</p>
        <p>''Red Hills,'' the Buglisi solo that opened the Buglisi/Foreman Dance  program on Sunday at the John Jay Theater, was inspired by Georgia O'Keeffe and had Christine Dakin as the O'Keeffe figure wandering through her own painting. The aura was indeed painterly, an essence captured strikingly by Jennifer DePalo in layers of red skirts. It was all roll and flow, matching the turbulence of the accompanying Liszt music.</p>
        <p>Both Ms. Dakin and Terese Capucilli are stars in the Martha Graham company, and one sees a more sensual side of their dancing in Mr. Foreman's choreography. In ''Field of Loves,'' they join Virginie Mecene, Mr. Foreman, Stephen Pier and Kevin Predmore in love images that are amplified and varied. Brahms's Sonata No. 2 was played live and with distinction by Brian Zeger, pianist, and Gil Morgenstern, violinist.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foreman's premiere, the four-part ''Suite; Arms Around Me'' is more experimental, rich and puzzling in its swings of mood. Ending in a frieze of frozen passion for four couples (Nancy Turano, Adam Hougland and Rika Okamoto joined Mr. Foreman, Ms. Capucilli, Mr. Predmore, Ms. Dakin and Mr. Pier) the work had also been playful. Crispin Cambell, cellist, and Daniel Roumain, violinist, added some improvisation.</p>
        <p>There were two quietly stunning pieces. In Mr. Foreman's ''From Pent Up, Aching Rivers,'' Miki Orihara and Mr. Pier became entangled in a passionate love duet as Walt Whitman's words were recited by Claire Bloom on tape. ''Suspended Women,'' a premiere by Ms. Buglisi, was mesmerizing: 12 ghostly women in hoop skirts and petticoats circled and collapsed in various states of angst to Mr. Roumain's interpolations on a Ravel concerto. The entrance of four men was both intrusive and welcome: a meditation on woman's lot.</p>
