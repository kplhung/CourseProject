        <p>Tiger Stadium would have never held the ball the Yankees' Jorge Posada smashed in the ninth inning tonight. No, Posada's drive would have crashed into the second deck and rattled amid empty seats, tying the game, and the Yankees would have probably gone on to beat the Tigers.</p>
        <p>But this is Comerica Park, with its wide dugouts, massive foul territory, huge outfield, and the looming and ragged skyline of Detroit serving as a backdrop.

        <p>Tiger Stadium would have never held the ball the Yankees' Jorge Posada smashed in the ninth inning tonight. No, Posada's drive would have crashed into the second deck and rattled amid empty seats, tying the game, and the Yankees would have probably gone on to beat the Tigers.</p>
        <p>But this is Comerica Park, with its wide dugouts, massive foul territory, huge outfield, and the looming and ragged skyline of Detroit serving as a backdrop. So on Posada's drive, left fielder Rich Becker retreated to about 340 feet from home plate and, with room to spare, caught the ball to end the game.</p>
        <p>For one night, the Tigers had a respite from their early-season misery, thumping Roger Clemens before hanging on through a counterattack in the late innings and winning, 9-7, before a crowd of 33,326, about 7,000 under capacity.</p>
        <p>Clemens (3-3) surrendered six runs on 10 hits and five walks in four and two-thirds innings to the Tigers, who averaged 2.4 runs a game in their first 13 home games here.</p>
        <p>''I feel like I wasted one right there,'' Clemens said.</p>
        <p>The Tigers are in last place, averaging 3.5 runs a game, and Clemens had pitched well in his most recent starts. His teammates were speculating that he was poised for a long streak of dominance. But this may have been Clemens's worst start with the Yankees, especially in light of the Tigers' woes this season.</p>
        <p>Warming up before the game, Clemens felt lethargy in his arm and right away, he asked Posada, his catcher, to help him. Clemens's arm was tired and he could not tell how hard he was throwing, or how he was finishing his pitches, and he wanted Posada to help him out.</p>
        <p>Clemens walked a couple of batters in the first inning and escaped, overcame an error in the second, then surrendered a run in the third on a run-scoring single by Juan Gonzalez, who had been 1 for 22 with runners in scoring position this year.</p>
        <p>The Tigers opened the fourth with a hit and a walk, but Clemens was confident that even with the fatigue he was feeling, he had good enough stuff to escape the jam and win. But when Jose Macias bunted in an attempt to advance the runners, Clemens froze for just an instant and the ball rolled to his right and past him for a single. Bases loaded.</p>
        <p>Deivi Cruz singled to score one run, Clemens walked Becker to force home a run, and Juan Encarnacion ripped a split-fingered fastball for a two-run single. Four runs, on some walks and a botched bunt. Four runs, and the Yankees trailed, 5-0.</p>
        <p>''You walk off after that,'' Clemens said later, ''and you just feel like you just wasted one. All the preparation you've done, and a wasted start.''</p>
        <p>Clemens was replaced after giving up a home run to Dean Palmer in the fifth, leaving the Yankees trailing,  6-2, and leaving himself sorely disappointed.</p>
        <p>The Tigers built their lead to 8-2 with two runs in the seventh, but Posada drove in one run and Tino Martinez two, and the lead was cut to 8-5. The Tigers added a run in the bottom of the eighth, but Paul O'Neill blasted a two-run homer in the ninth.</p>
        <p>Now it was Tigers 9, Yankees 7, and Bernie Williams then tripled. Posada came to the plate as the potential tying run, against Todd Jones. There were two outs.</p>
        <p>Posada fell behind no balls and two strikes, became more defensive in his swing, batting left-handed. He just wanted to put the ball in play, to keep the rally alive. But when Jones made a mistake, Posada whacked it to left field. A few of the Yankees in the dugout thought, for just an instant, that Posada's drive would carry out.</p>
        <p>''Not in this park,'' Posada said later.</p>
        <p>Scott Brosius said, ''It definitely changes the way you play things.''</p>
        <p>About the new ballpark, Brosius said: ''You're trying to create that fan-friendly environment, and the second deck is 400 yards away from the field. It's so open. Obviously, they're trying to make an effort here to keep the offense down. That's fine, but you should build a park that fans look forward to coming into and being near the game, especially when they're used to a field where they're on top of the players. But they're nowhere close to the field in this park.''</p>
        <p>The kicker is that the Tigers have complained about the size of the park.</p>
        <p>The enormous outfield has been the focal point of the Tigers players, who gripe publicly and privately about how difficult it is to hit home runs here, with distances of 345 feet down the left-field line, 395 to left-center and 420 to center field.</p>
        <p>But those complaints have been muted because the Tigers have hit miserably in road games, as well, and have played terribly, losing 23 of their first 33 games.</p>
        <p>The best-case scenario was for the Tigers to open their new ballpark with a dynamic contender. So far, the Tigers are presenting the worst-case scenario. They have opened the new ballpark with a lousy team, and the attendance has been mediocre.</p>
        <p>''Guys definitely wanted to win and help feed that fire that came with the excitement of opening a new park,'' Brad Ausmus, the Detroit catcher, said. ''You bring more people in the seats, get that energy and that atmosphere in the stands during the games.</p>
        <p>''The first few games, there was energy, but then because of the way the team has played, the energy has slowly been dwindling. You can't blame the fans, they get tired of seeing the team lose.''</p>
        <p>But the Tigers won big tonight against the Yankees, saved by the wide open spaces of their new home. Tiger Stadium would have never held Posada's drive.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>CHUCK KNOBLAUCH's throwing troubles have been dormant this season, but they are not extinct. Knoblauch fielded an easy grounder in the second inning, then seemed to stiffen suddenly and throw awkwardly to first, pulling TINO MARTINEZ off the base. It was Knoblauch's first throwing error of the year. . . . Tigers outfielder BOBBY HIGGINSON is not playing in this series, as he serves a suspension for his part in a fight with Chicago on April 22.</p>
