        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The end of a marriage is always tragic. But it is between two people and not 20 million. The details of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's separation from his wife, Donna Hanover (front page, May 11), should be kept private. With all that the American people have been made to know in recent years regarding the lives of our politicians, is there nothing that can remain private? Especially when it does not concern unlawful behavior or a politician's job performance.</p>

        <p>For the sake of their children and the moral integrity of every New Yorker, both the couple and the press should keep the details behind closed doors.</p>
