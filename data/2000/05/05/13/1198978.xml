        <p>The pianist and composer Lennie Tristano left a legacy that seems to go radically against the grain of jazz in the be-bop era: for the most part, his surviving music sacrifices dynamics and the ecstatic spilling-over of swinging rhythm sections; on his records, drummers tick like metronomes, avoiding the emphasis of the second and fourth beats.</p>
        <p>The official evidence -- a spate of albums dating from the late 1940's to the early 60's, when he turned to private teaching until his death in 1978 -- suggests that he wrote himself out of jazz's mid-century rhythmic revolution. But Tristano did not have a grudge against rhythm; he loved layering different meters, and his own piano playing, with its hammering legato, shows that he internalized the patterns of Charlie Parker and Fats Navarro. Moreover, it is known that he performed concerts with some of the most outgoing, challenging drummers in jazz, including Roy Haynes and Max Roach; unfortunately, little of that music got on tape.</p>

        <p>The pianist and composer Lennie Tristano left a legacy that seems to go radically against the grain of jazz in the be-bop era: for the most part, his surviving music sacrifices dynamics and the ecstatic spilling-over of swinging rhythm sections; on his records, drummers tick like metronomes, avoiding the emphasis of the second and fourth beats.</p>
        <p>The official evidence -- a spate of albums dating from the late 1940's to the early 60's, when he turned to private teaching until his death in 1978 -- suggests that he wrote himself out of jazz's mid-century rhythmic revolution. But Tristano did not have a grudge against rhythm; he loved layering different meters, and his own piano playing, with its hammering legato, shows that he internalized the patterns of Charlie Parker and Fats Navarro. Moreover, it is known that he performed concerts with some of the most outgoing, challenging drummers in jazz, including Roy Haynes and Max Roach; unfortunately, little of that music got on tape.</p>
        <p>''The Lennie Tristano Legacy,'' a concert presented at Tribeca Performing Arts Center last Saturday night and directed by members of the Jazz Composers Collective, presented both Tristanos. In approaching music of the past, a clever jazz band writes its own ticket: here, even Tristano, one of the most intransigently original figures in jazz, was poked, prodded and meaningfully reinterpreted.</p>
        <p>The first half of the show featured Lee Konitz, the alto saxophonist who was one of Tristano's closest associates in the late 1940's and early 50's; that experience left a permanent impression on his subsequent career, in terms of repertory, instrumentation and many other things. Even so, Mr. Konitz is as original a player as there is in jazz, with a sound that has remained limpid and innocent and an emphasis on melody that makes him always easy to follow.</p>
        <p>His set was quiet, sometimes lugubrious; a few duos and trio pieces nearly flatlined in deference to the Tristano code of suppressed dynamics, and the drummer Tony Moreno, using brushes rather than sticks, kept his input to suggestions rather than declarations. (The room, as acoustically dead as a cardboard box, was merciless on this kind of playing.) What turned the performance around was the addition of a few more players: Mark Turner on tenor saxophone and Ron Horton on trumpet. The full band struck into Mr. Konitz's melody ''Thingin','' based on the chord changes of ''All the Things You Are,'' structuring it first as a round of solo statements, then as a full-group interplay.</p>
        <p>Seeing these two saxophonists together turned out to be one of the more interesting onstage juxtapositions in recent memory. Mr. Turner, who has few equals among the current generation, nurtures his own Tristano fascination, and he displayed it via calm, controlled lines of notes that traveled to the very end of a deep breath. He is young and virtuosic, and he folded sophisticated harmony and huge intervallic leaps into his playing. Mr. Konitz, by comparison, is all boiled-down wisdom: he makes diatonic, sunny music, with  surface simplicity; even when he is in the heat of improvisation, it sounds like someone whistling a tune he has known all his life. At the end of ''Thingin','' the rhythm section and the three horn players worked out improvised counterpoint, in the Bach-like style that Tristano favored, and it was beautiful.</p>
        <p>The second half of the concert, with the saxophonist Michael Blake replacing Mr. Konitz, stuck to Tristano material but used it to different ends. Rhythmically, it was outspoken: Mr. Moreno used sticks instead of brushes and locked into driving grooves with the pianist Ben Allison.  And Mr. Blake's aggressive sound, peppered with the wildness of split-tone shrieks, drove up the energy.  The band -- which also included the pianist Frank Kimbrough -- had thought hard and effectively about how to re-do this music. In Tristano's ''Wow,'' the melody, in four, was laid over a waltz rhythm; piano and trumpet played Tristano's galloping, whorl-like lines, while saxophone and bass played the ground notes in unison; and the drumming was in half-time. It was a floating feeling -- so different from what we would recognize as the Tristano sound yet completely viable.</p>
