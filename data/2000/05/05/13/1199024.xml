        <p>Heavy fighting erupted today along the disputed border of Ethiopia and Eritrea.

        <p>Heavy fighting erupted today along the disputed border of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Many diplomats said they believed that the outbreak was a push by Ethiopia to end a war that has worsened severe food shortages in the region and claimed tens of thousands of lives in two years of sporadic fighting.</p>
        <p>The battles -- fought on two fronts, and possibly three -- began two days after a United Nations Security Council team left the region in an unsuccessful attempt to narrow minute differences in a proposed peace accord. The fighting provoked swift condemnation from other countries, angry that Ethiopia, in particular, is at war again when as many as eight million of its people face hunger because of drought.</p>
        <p>A large operation to feed the hungry had apparently not been affected after a day of fighting. But relief officials said they were worried. ''We have concerns regarding the potential impact if the conflict is prolonged,'' said Roberta Rossi, a spokeswoman for the United Nations World Food Program in Ethiopia.</p>
        <p>The problems could include difficulties in sending food to the 270,000 people displaced by the war near the front, and crippled ports and roads that help import hundreds of thousands of tons of grain.</p>
        <p>The war's casualties have been particularly high, much worse than in Congo or, more recently, in Sierra Leone. Experts put the minimum number of dead at 20,000, and some estimates have ranged as high as 70,000. Neither side has released figures.</p>
        <p>The numbers are high because both sides are experienced fighters, with modern weaponry, facing each other across trenches in huge numbers. Experts say each side has 300,000 soldiers, most of whom appear to be near the front.</p>
        <p>Late this evening, Ethiopia said that it had the upper hand in fighting on the westernmost front and that its soldiers had broken through three lines of Eritrean trenches and had taken what it called strategic points. Saying it expected to fight through the night, Ethiopia also said it had bombed deep into Eritrean territory.  But Yemane Ghebremeskel, an aide to President Isaais Afwerki of Eritrea, denied any Ethiopian gains. ''They have not been able to make any progress,'' Mr. Afwerki said tonight. ''This was supposed to be a surprise attack. They have nothing to show for it.''</p>
        <p>This week, Richard C. Holbrooke, the American ambassador to the United Nations, warned as he left the region without helping broker a deal that thousands of soldiers could die if the fighting resumed in a war that he called senseless.</p>
        <p>Although details were few, it appeared that the fighting was every bit as intense as in the past. ''It is very ferocious,'' said Kidane Woldeyesus, a spokesman for the Eritrean Embassy in Kenya.</p>
        <p>Eritrea blamed Ethiopia for launching the offensive. Unlike the situation in earlier outbreaks of fighting, Ethiopia did not deny that.</p>
        <p>''What I can say about this is that we have been at war for two years,'' said a spokeswoman for Ethiopia,  Selome Taddesse. ''It has never stopped.''</p>
        <p>The two countries agree that the fighting started overnight on the westernmost front, in the Badme region, an area that has been in dispute since May 1998. Both sides claim the region, although the border was never formally established when Eritrea, once the northernmost region of Ethiopia, split from Ethiopia in 1991.</p>
        <p>Around dawn, fighting spread to the middle front, near Tsorona. Mr. Ghebremeskel said there was just an artillery exchange. Ethiopia said fighting had also erupted along the easternmost front, south of the port at Assab. Eritrea denied that, too.</p>
        <p>Although there have been occasional skirmishes recently, this appears to be by far the worst fighting in nearly a year. The fighting on possibly three fronts appears to suggest a concentrated assault, if indeed Ethiopia has begun an offensive. In recent days, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia has raised the possibility of an assault, warning diplomats that he wanted a quick end to the war and expressing frustration at the peace effort, which the Organization of African Unity brokered.</p>
        <p>Ethiopia contends that Eritrea invaded around Badme, and there is no dispute that Ethiopian officials administered the area. But Eritrean officials said the area was theirs. At any rate, they blame the Ethiopians for the delays because they accepted the full peace package long ago.</p>
        <p>In fierce fighting last year, Eritrea was largely pushed out of Badme. But it has remained in areas that Ethiopia says it owns. Ethiopia also occupies land, particularly south of Assab, that Eritrea claims.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holbrooke and other diplomats have been frustrated by both countries, in part because Badme, the main area in dispute, has no particular value and in part because the differences between them in the peace accord seem so small.</p>
