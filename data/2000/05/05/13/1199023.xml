        <p>Four days of closing arguments ended yesterday in the trial of a mother and son charged in the murder of a wealthy Manhattan widow, with prosecutors arguing that while the defendants had successfully hidden the body, they left a map to the crime inside 14 spiral-bound notebooks.</p>
        <p>The arguments followed 13 weeks of testimony from 130 witnesses in State Supreme Court in Manhattan in which prosecutors built a complex circumstantial case to try to prove that Sante and Kenneth Kimes killed Irene Silverman, despite the fact that her body has never been found.</p>
        <p>The jury is to begin deliberating on Monday.</p>
        <p>Defense lawyers told the jurors this week that they should not convict the Kimeses of murder, because they cannot know for certain that Mrs. Silverman is dead.</p>
        <p>But prosecutors argued during their closing statement that Mrs. Silverman died on July 5, 1998, the last day anyone saw her alive. Prosecutors said the Kimeses left ample evidence in a series of notebooks of their intention to kill Mrs. Silverman and steal her town house, which is worth almost $8 million.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kimes's hands were still yesterday, although she had been an inveterate note taker throughout the trial, scribbling frantically as prosecutors questioned witnesses. Prosecutors said yesterday that her habit of making lists would provide the jury with the evidence needed to convict her.</p>
        <p>''Everything they are trying to do to Mrs. Silverman is laid out in these notebooks,'' said Ann Donnelly, a prosecutor. ''If you look at them, you will see the relentless plan to take Mrs. Silverman's life.''</p>
        <p>Many of the notebooks contain list upon list. There are notes of weapons to buy: stun gun, knives, Mace. There are lists of videos to watch, including ''Whispering Death,'' and pamphlets to read, ''Document Fraud and Other Crimes'' and ''How to Build a Practical Firearms Suppressor.'' There are lists of information to learn: the town house staff schedules, the layout of the building and Mrs. Silverman's Social Security number.</p>
        <p>The defense has suggested that the notebooks are forgeries or have been altered by the police. They also have noted that there are no direct statements in the notebooks about killing Mrs. Silverman, and have said the prosecution jumped to false conclusions. When Ms. Donnelly said yesterday that she thought the notation ''glvs'' meant ''gloves,'' Michael Hardy, a lawyer for Mrs. Kimes, objected.</p>
        <p>''Judge,'' Mr. Hardy said, ''the Temptations have a song, 'Just My Imagination.' ''</p>
        <p>Defense lawyers objected frequently yesterday as prosecutors laid out their theory of how Mrs. Silverman was killed. Prosecutors said they believed that the Kimeses planned from the start of their scheme to kill Mrs. Silverman.</p>
        <p>''There should be no question the defendants did away with Irene Silverman,'' said Connie Fernandez, the lead prosecutor. ''No one else had a motive. She had to die that day, she had to be made to disappear or their plans would be ruined.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Fernandez said the Kimeses had originally planned to kill Mrs. Silverman on July 12, but acted earlier when Mr. Kimes learned by eavesdropping that Mrs. Silverman was about to evict him from the apartment he had rented from her.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said they believed the Kimeses grabbed Mrs. Silverman as she walked past their apartment door, choking her and possibly shocking her with an electric stun gun. Ms. Fernandez said the Kimeses threw Mrs. Silverman on a shower curtain, bound her with duct tape, wrapped her in a garbage bag, stuffed her in a duffel bag and then carted her off in the trunk of their stolen Lincoln Town Car.</p>
        <p>The Kimeses disposed of Mrs. Silverman's body, then returned to the house and burglarized her office, prosecutors said. They stole keys, blank checks, $10,000 and her Social Security card, which they needed to complete the fraudulent deed transfer, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the Kimeses have said the prosecution's theory is merely speculation. Mr. Hardy has argued that while prosecutors have produced guns and masks, knockout potions and handcuffs, they have linked none of it to Mrs. Silverman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hardy criticized the police investigation, suggesting that detectives had not questioned other possible suspects. Mel Sachs, a lawyer for Mr. Kimes, went a step further in his closing argument. Nearly shouting, he asked the jury to acquit his client because, he said, the police could have moved evidence from the house to the Kimeses' car.</p>
        <p>''Send a significant message that we base cases on evidence and only on evidence, and defendants are going to be treated and tried fairly,'' Mr. Sachs said.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, Ms. Fernandez said the only fair and just action the jury could take was to convict the Kimeses. ''Do not reward these defendants because they were clever enough to dispose of her body,'' she urged.</p>
