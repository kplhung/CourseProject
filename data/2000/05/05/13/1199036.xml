        <p>Editorial reports that debate between two Democrats in New Jersey's senatorial primary was 'brutal but revealing' match betwen Jim Florio and Jon Corzine</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>With a crucial Senate primary less than a month away, New Jersey voters have finally seen their first unscripted debates this week, the highlight being a brutal but revealing match between the two Democratic candidates. The encounter forced Jon Corzine, a former Wall Street financier with no political experience, to come out from behind his $1 million-a-week advertising shield to face off against an opponent known for his acerbic debating style, former Gov. Jim Florio.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's goal was to turn his opponent's jousting skills against him, to use a kind of oratorical jujitsu to combat the gibes and one-liners that Mr. Florio used throughout the exchange. With his reputation as a bumbler, Mr. Corzine did not need to soar, only to survive, which he clearly did. Still, Mr. Florio hammered at his rival's political weakness -- that Mr. Corzine is an unknown whose proposals are untested and whose financial records are still mostly secret by today's political standards. The ex-governor ridiculed Mr. Corzine's ''know-nothing views'' and ''lame'' campaign.</p>

        <p>With a crucial Senate primary less than a month away, New Jersey voters have finally seen their first unscripted debates this week, the highlight being a brutal but revealing match between the two Democratic candidates. The encounter forced Jon Corzine, a former Wall Street financier with no political experience, to come out from behind his $1 million-a-week advertising shield to face off against an opponent known for his acerbic debating style, former Gov. Jim Florio.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's goal was to turn his opponent's jousting skills against him, to use a kind of oratorical jujitsu to combat the gibes and one-liners that Mr. Florio used throughout the exchange. With his reputation as a bumbler, Mr. Corzine did not need to soar, only to survive, which he clearly did. Still, Mr. Florio hammered at his rival's political weakness -- that Mr. Corzine is an unknown whose proposals are untested and whose financial records are still mostly secret by today's political standards. The ex-governor ridiculed Mr. Corzine's ''know-nothing views'' and ''lame'' campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, whose opening and closing remarks were carefully scripted, managed to lay out the criticisms that haunt Mr. Florio -- his aggressive manner and the way he increased taxes as governor in order to pay for necessary education improvements in the state. Anger over the increase, including a regressive sales tax, helped bring a Republican takeover of the state's political structures and drew bitter recriminations from some Democratic officials. Mr. Corzine put it more gently than many in his party when he suggested that Mr. Florio ''took a problem and made it into a crisis.''</p>
        <p>The debate, sponsored by NJN Public Television in Trenton and The New York Times, raised important questions about Mr. Florio's stormy political history and Mr. Corzine's failure to release enough detail about the financial holdings underwriting his campaign. It also underscored the need for more debates. Mr. Corzine has declined an invitation to a debate sponsored by New Jersey's League of Women Voters and scheduled to be aired on ABC stations in New York and Philadelphia. As a newcomer to politics, Mr. Corzine has an obligation to accept the invitation, especially now that the polls show that his costly television campaign is fast eroding Mr. Florio's lead in the June 6 primary. What New Jersey voters need now are more unrehearsed exchanges.</p>
