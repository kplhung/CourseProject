        <p>In the wake of new allegations about the volatile behavior of Bob Knight, Indiana's basketball coach, a meeting of university trustees scheduled for tomorrow has taken on new urgency.</p>
        <p>John Walda and Frederick Eichhorn -- the trustees who were assigned to investigate allegations that Knight put his hand around the neck of the former Hoosier player Neil Reid at a practice in 1997 -- are expected to report at the meeting about the progress of their inquiry.</p>
        <p>But several other recently reported allegations about Knight's behavior have created the sense that the trustees -- there are nine in all -- may decide to expand the investigation of Knight or begin moves to force the coach out. The most damaging new allegation is from Jeanette Hartgraves, the athletic department secretary, who said Knight threw a vase in her office 12 years ago -- it shattered against a wall -- in an angry fit about not being able to see Ralph Floyd, who was then the school's athletic director.</p>
        <p>Christopher Simpson, Indiana's vice president, denied yesterday that trustees were already considering whether to ask Knight to resign, and he disputed reports that the coach was scheduled to meet with Myles Brand, the school's president, tomorrow. He said Knight was on vacation and due to return to the area late today.</p>
        <p>Simpson, who has spoken for Brand throughout the investigation, said that if a meeting had been set up between the coach and the school president, ''I would think I'd be aware of it.''</p>
        <p>The quickened pace of the investigation, which was originally intended to conclude by June, has prompted more public demonstrations of support for Knight, as well as newly stated opposition to the embattled coach. Todd Starowitz, an athletic department spokesman, said many of the team's current players said they would leave the program if Knight was forced out.</p>
        <p>''Our players became very upset today, and told me they were tired of being quiet,'' Starowitz said. ''They don't want to see things tried in the media. To a man, everyone supports Coach Knight.''</p>
        <p>But Murray Sperber, an Indiana professor who frequently writes about college sports and has been a critic of Knight, said his e-mail messages showed the coach was beginning to lose significant support among Hoosier fans and alumni -- largely because of the vase-smashing allegations.</p>
        <p>''It has gone from a steady 3-to-1 for Knight and me shutting up to a 3-to-1 for me speaking out and Knight must go!'' he said. ''I think that the revelations really shocked some people and silenced others.''</p>
