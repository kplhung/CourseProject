        <p>In a moment of panic, the well-pressed Pat Riley came halfway out of his jacket, went darting onto the glossy floor of Madison Square Garden and started pleading for his team's playoff life.</p>
        <p>For a brief instant, Riley had yet another demon to haunt him, yet another Knick-induced moment to gnaw at his thoughts. With 2.2 seconds left in overtime, Riley watched as Dan Crawford, an official, waved off the floater that Anthony Carter sent up over the tips of Patrick Ewing's fingers, from an angle that might have been behind the backboard. As the playground shot bounded high off the rim and began its plunge into the net, Crawford thought that Alonzo Mourning touched it.</p>
        <p>But Hue Hollins saw it differently. He overruled Crawford, much to the dismay of an irate Jeff Van Gundy. The Knicks weren't arguing the offensive interference, they wanted the shot called off because they saw Carter illegally launch his floater from behind the backboard. The Knicks lost their case. And after a turnover on the last play of the draining night, they went on to lose Game 3, 77-76, in a finish that left Latrell Sprewell staring at the Garden ceiling in disbelief.</p>
        <p>''It's a hard way to lose, losing on a H-O-R-S-E shot,'' said Sprewell, who finally shook the defense of the Heat and scored 23 points during a 6-for-14 night. ''I kept saying it came from behind the basket.''</p>
        <p>Afterward, Crawford said the replay of the shot showed two things: Mourning did not touch the ball, and there was nothing conclusive to indicate that the shot was launched from behind the backboard.</p>
        <p>''They got the right call for the wrong reason,'' Van Gundy said. ''They called it no good for the offensive goaltending, which there wasn't. But the ball was shot from behind the backboard.''</p>
        <p>As in Game 1, the Knicks lost their composure down the stretch. They took ill-advised shots, turned the ball over and missed free throws. The kicker came at the buzzer. With 2.2 seconds left in overtime, the Knicks botched any chance of a miracle finish when Charlie Ward turned the ball over on the inbounds pass. Riley exited quickly as Madison Square Garden fell silent. The Heat had done it. They had come into the Knicks' home and stolen back their home-court advantage by taking a 2-1 advantage in this four-of-seven-game Eastern Conference semifinal.</p>
        <p>It was another episode in this rivalry that resembled a finger painting stuck on the refrigerator -- a game only a mother could find beauty in -- but it was not short on intense drama. Beneath the grind, the Knicks held the Heat to 36.5 percent from the field, but were outrebounded, 45-34. They held the foul-prone Mourning to a respectable 23 points, but were outscored by the Heat bench, 21-6. The next installment of this rivalry will be Game 4 tomorrow afternoon at the Garden.</p>
        <p>''That's a must-win for us,'' Sprewell said. ''We have to recover from this and come right back at them. We can't go back to Miami down, 3-1.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks were so close to going up in this series. Sprewell (23 points) and Allan Houston (24 points) had finally shaken loose of the Heat's stifling defense. And Ewing (9 points) finally surfaced as he came through gallantly to force overtime. Ewing came up with his first basket in 15 minutes as he released a game-tying 17-foot jumper from beyond the free-throw line with 2.6 seconds left in regulation. Backpedaling down the court with his wrist hanging in the air for effect, he seemed to be waving goodbye to the Heat for the night.</p>
        <p>He seemed prescient when Charlie Ward fired a bullet pass to Marcus Camby for a dunk a tick before the shot clock expired to give the Knicks a 75-71 lead with 2 minutes 13 seconds left in regulation. But from then on, the Knicks gave the game away. Sprewell was trapped with nowhere to pass to, and let precious seconds tick off the shot clock on another failed possession before Ewing dribbled the ball off his own foot for a turnover.</p>
        <p>Ewing slipped into the skin of the heart-breaker. He missed one of two free throws with 13.7 seconds left that could have given the Knicks a 2-point lead. Instead, they clung to a 76-75 edge that was erased by Carter, who guided the Heat when the limping Tim Hardaway struggled.</p>
        <p>''It's disappointing,'' Ewing said. ''We have to play much better. We have to rebound the ball better. We just have to play better all around. Naturally, we'd love to have won the game. But we have never done anything easy around here. We have always had to push it to the limit, and we just have to pick ourselves up and get ready for Sunday.''</p>
        <p>The Heat stayed in the game on the shooting of Clarence Weatherspoon and P. J. Brown when Mourning was forced to sit down for 12 minutes of the second half after picking up his fourth foul midway through the third quarter. With Carter on the floor, the Heat took a 60-57 lead with seven minutes left in the game after Brown shook free for an open jumper on a pick-and-roll play.</p>
        <p>At this point, the Knicks had scored just 1 point in the fourth quarter. On the Knicks' next possession, Houston hit a jumper for the team's first field goal of the fourth quarter with 6:47 left in the game. Mourning, who slipped back into the game with eight minutes remaining, came up with a jump hook to give the Heat a 62-59 lead.</p>
        <p>The Heat went back and forth with the Knicks with plays like this: On a scramble for a loose ball, Brown dug it out of Sprewell's hands, a play that led to a basket by Jamal Mashburn. After Mourning lost the ball when he was trapped, he gathered it and sent up a jumper that fell as the shot clock expired.</p>
        <p>Then, with 6.1 seconds left in regulation, the ball went to Houston. And knowing the Heat would double him, Houston directed the pass to Ewing, who sank his game-tying shot.</p>
        <p>That was when the real drama began. That was when the scene was set for Carter's big bounce. ''It was a tough bounce,'' Houston said. ''The key is how you respond. We can't dwell on this. We have to move on.''</p>
        <p>Once upon a time, Houston had the magical bounce on his shot: in Game 5 of last season's first-round series, down in Miami, right in front of Riley. It's a shot that gave Riley night sweats. Last night, when it appeared Carter's shot might be disallowed, the coach nearly had another reason to wake up screaming.</p>
        <p>''I hope this is not a payback,'' Houston said. ''This isn't, because we're still playing. That's the difference. We have to move on and find a way to respond.''</p>
