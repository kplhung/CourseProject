        <p>Legal gun sales around the nation came to a halt after a computer software malfunction at the Federal Bureau of Investigation prevented instant background checks of prospective buyers, officials said today.</p>
        <p>Beginning on Thursday afternoon, gun store owners and the police were unable to access the the F.B.I.'s Interstate Identification Index, a database containing the criminal records of 36 million people, said Steve Fischer, a spokesman for the bureau.</p>
        <p>The problem involved a software malfunction at the bureau's facility in Clarksburg, W. Va., and was not a result of computer hacking, Mr. Fischer said.</p>
        <p>The F.B.I. said the current breakdown of the criminal records database was the longest to date. Technicians believe that the system cannot be repaired until Saturday evening at the earliest.</p>
        <p>The malfunction also knocked out the system by which law enforcement officials around the country use fingerprints to access criminal records, Mr. Fischer said.</p>
        <p>Gun dealers in different parts of the country complained to the F.B.I. that it was costing them business, the spokesman said.</p>
        <p>''They're also calling their Congressional offices across the country, and we're hearing from them also,'' he added.</p>
        <p>The criminal background check, which can take place within seconds when the system is functioning properly, was mandated by the 1993 Brady law.</p>
        <p>Named for President Ronald Reagan's former press secretary, James S. Brady, the law bars felons, minors and those convicted of domestic violence from buying guns.</p>
        <p>In November, President Clinton credited the Brady law with blocking more than 470,000 gun sales to ''felons, fugitives, stalkers and others prohibited from purchasing firearms.''</p>
        <p>The National Rifle Association vigorously opposed the law, however, arguing that it would not stop criminals. The association also denounced the law as onerous for law-abiding gun store customers.</p>
        <p>Owners of gun store said they had failed to complete sales today. Some said they continued to accept paperwork for gun purchases, and would run the background checks when the database was again accessible.</p>
        <p>''It's certainly getting in the way of business,'' said Ronnie Ball, the owner of Dawson's Small Arms of the World in Annandale, Va. ''People are not happy about it, but if it's a legitimate computer breakdown, what are you going to do?''</p>
        <p>At the Gentleman Hunter in Bethesda, Md., the owner, Art Harris, told The Associated Press, ''We haven't lost any deals yet, but Saturday is our biggest day.''</p>
