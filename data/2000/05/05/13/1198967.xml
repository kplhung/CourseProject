        <p>Lincoln P Bloomfield Jr letter endorses fairness of judging George W Bush's readiness for presidency by his 'experience' as Texas governor</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush's readiness to assume the presidency should indeed be judged on his ''experience'' as Texas governor and as a private-sector executive who has faced a measure of both failure and success (editorial, May 7). You say Texas has a ''weak-governor system,'' but it is Vice President Al Gore and his supporters who unhesitatingly attribute Texas's policies on the environment, capital punishment, gun control and other matters to Mr. Bush.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush's readiness to assume the presidency should indeed be judged on his ''experience'' as Texas governor and as a private-sector executive who has faced a measure of both failure and success (editorial, May 7). You say Texas has a ''weak-governor system,'' but it is Vice President Al Gore and his supporters who unhesitatingly attribute Texas's policies on the environment, capital punishment, gun control and other matters to Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Gore, any legislator or federal policy official is acquainted with a range of issues. But beyond casting votes in Congress, he does not appear ever to have occupied a position, public or private, where the ''buck stops.'' Mr. Bush's experience as accountable decision maker, public and private, exceeds that of Mr. Gore, as well as that of Bill Clinton in 1992.</p>
        <p>LINCOLN P. BLOOMFIELD JR.  Alexandria, Va., May 8, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer was a deputy assistant secretary of state in 1992-93.</p>
