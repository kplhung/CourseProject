        <p>An 8-year-old Queens girl was abandoned by her mother at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Thursday and was found wandering disoriented among the antiquities in the Egyptian wing, the police said yesterday. The girl's mother was arrested when she returned to pick her up six hours later.</p>
        <p>The child, Latisha Isaac, caught the attention of a guard Thursday afternoon because she was alone and appeared anxious, a museum spokesman, Harold Holzer, said yesterday. The guard, Gregory Monaco, asked the girl if she was alone, Mr. Holzer said, adding, ''She said she was looking for her mommy.''</p>
        <p>The mother, Paula Isaac, 40, of South Jamaica, Queens, had left her daughter about 12:30 p.m., after the girl had gone to the bathroom, according to a police report. ''Mrs. Isaac states she left her child at the museum because she was mad at her for wanting to go to the bathroom,''  the report said. Ms. Isaac wandered  Manhattan on foot for hours before returning to the museum about 6 p.m., the police said.</p>
        <p>Tall for her age and slim, Latisha initially appeared anxious but grew more comfortable as guards walked her through the museum, trying to find her mother, Mr. Holzer said.</p>
        <p>The girl had apparently been searching on her own for about an hour. ''She spent the whole time looking for her mother,'' a police official said.</p>
        <p>When the guards could not find the mother, they called the police at the Central Park Precinct, Mr. Holzer said. Before the police arrived, the  girl spent her time with museum staff members, at one point sitting with volunteers in the circular information booth in the museum's cavernous lobby, where she drew pictures with crayons.</p>
        <p>Latisha seemed calm and relaxed once she was with museum staff members, Mr. Holzer said. ''She was very articulate, very poised,'' he said. After 45 minutes at the information desk, he said, she announced that she was hungry and was taken to the museum staff's cafeteria, where she had a bologna sandwich, a taco and some fruit.</p>
        <p>Asked if the museum staff could call her father, the girl said, ''He's not here,'' adding of her mother, ''She's a single mom,'' Mr. Holzer said. Ms. Isaac later told the police and prosecutors that her husband died of cancer about two years ago.</p>
        <p>Investigators were unsure why, beyond her statement that she had been angry with her daughter, Ms. Isaac had left the child alone.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors in the office of Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, were drawing up a criminal complaint last night charging Ms. Isaac with endangering the welfare of a child, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Isaac returned to the Metropolitan about 6 p.m., she asked the guards at the front door whether a lost child was inside, Mr. Holzer said. The guards referred her to the Central Park Precinct, where she was questioned by detectives and arrested. Her daughter, whom the police had taken to Lenox Hill Hospital for a medical evaluation, was pronounced in good health and placed in the care of the city's Administration for Children's Services.</p>
