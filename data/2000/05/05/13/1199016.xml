        <p>President Clinton took his campaign to improve trade relations with China to the Midwest today, arguing that if Congress rejected the measure it would deny troubled farmers a chance to tap a giant new market.</p>
        <p>Standing on hay bales in a made-for-television panorama of grain silos and combines at a Minnesota family farm, the president said soybean and corn producers could expect an ''almost incalculable'' increase in exports if China opened its markets to American agriculture the way other Asian nations had. But, Mr. Clinton warned, the opportunity will be lost unless Congress votes yes on extending permanent trading rights to Beijing when the issue comes to the floor this month.</p>
        <p>''Chinese farmers cannot keep pace with their own consumers,'' he said. ''But American farmers can.''</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, Mr. Clinton visited Canton, Ohio, where he attended a panel discussion on China trade organized by Representative Tom Sawyer, an Ohio Democrat who is counted as undecided on whether to end Congress's annual review of China's trade status. Congressional aides said the meeting, at a National Guard facility next to the Akron-Canton regional airport, was to rally political support for Mr. Sawyer, who faces intense union pressure to vote against the measure.</p>
        <p>President Clinton has campaigned for the China trade bill every day this week, stepping up his lobbying as the vote approaches. But he still faces a struggle in Congress, where his own party leadership stands four-square against the measure and supporters are still shy of the 218 supporters they need in the House.</p>
        <p>An agreement the United States negotiated to clear China's entry into the World Trade Organization requires on overhaul of that nation's tariffs and trade barriers generally, but promises especially big export opportunities in China's now heavily regulated farm sector. Congress is being asked to give up its annual review of China's trade status to take full advantage of China's entry into the Geneva-based trade body.</p>
        <p>White House officials have said that strong support from agricultural districts could tip the balance in Congress, where the farm lobby is strong and is seen as a counterweight to organized labor's steadfast opposition.</p>
        <p>Several hundred farmers, their jackets tied around their waists in the bright sun, gathered at the Hauer farm to hear the president. Some complained that Mr. Clinton had not done enough to relieve the farming crisis, but applauded his stance on China trade.</p>
        <p>''If every Chinese ate two more eggs a week, they would need the entire grain crop of Minnesota just to feed their chickens,'' said J.R. Hanson, 51, who operates his own 800-acre spread nearby. ''But I'm not saying this is a miracle cure.''</p>
        <p>Clearly sensing that economic arguments alone are unlikely to sway Congress, Mr. Clinton also emphasized his view that China must get permanent trading rights for national security reasons. In both Ohio and Minnesota, he said that while granting the new rights was no guarantee that China would democratize, rejecting the measure would boost  Communist hard-liners in that country and set the stage for a hostile relationship across the Pacific.</p>
        <p>Still, the quandary some Democratic lawmakers face defying either the president or powerful labor interests in an election year was on full display in Ohio. Outside the armory gate, several dozen union protesters in the heavy industrial area warned Mr. Sawyer that his job was at risk if he backed Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''People who vote the wrong way in this Congress are going to be punished this time around,'' said Warren Davis, a United Auto Workers organizer in the region who attended the rally. Labor unions have argued that the China agreement would promote the transfer of good manufacturing jobs to that country.</p>
        <p>Formal consideration of the China trade measure was set to begin next Wednesday, when the House Ways  and Means Committee is expected approve the bill. The Senate Finance Committee, also expected to vote yes, will take it up the same day. The full House vote is planned for the week of May 22, and the outcome is considered too close to call.</p>
