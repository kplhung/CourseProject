        <p>Editorial demands that Pres Alberto Fujimori allow fair runoff vote in Peru's presidential election</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In the first round of Peru's presidential elections last month, President Alberto Fujimori manipulated the agencies that oversaw the election and counted the votes. He kept coverage of his major opponent -- and even the candidate's advertising -- off television. Opposition rallies were sabotaged and candidates and election monitors intimidated. If there had not been intense international criticism of the abuses, Mr. Fujimori would probably have pushed his vote total over the 50 percent required to claim victory.</p>
        <p>He stopped short of that, and on May 28 will face Alejandro Toledo, a business school professor with no political experience, in a runoff. Yet despite continued foreign pressure Mr. Fujimori has done little to make the second round more democratic. Balanced media coverage is the most pressing need. In the first round he controlled the television stations and newspapers, which ran only slurs about Mr. Toledo alongside worshipful coverage and paid advertisements touting Mr. Fujimori. Mr. Toledo's most recent rallies have made the nightly news, and the government has stopped the barrage of Fujimori ads. But the media are still heavily tilted toward Mr. Fujimori.</p>

        <p>In the first round of Peru's presidential elections last month, President Alberto Fujimori manipulated the agencies that oversaw the election and counted the votes. He kept coverage of his major opponent -- and even the candidate's advertising -- off television. Opposition rallies were sabotaged and candidates and election monitors intimidated. If there had not been intense international criticism of the abuses, Mr. Fujimori would probably have pushed his vote total over the 50 percent required to claim victory.</p>
        <p>He stopped short of that, and on May 28 will face Alejandro Toledo, a business school professor with no political experience, in a runoff. Yet despite continued foreign pressure Mr. Fujimori has done little to make the second round more democratic. Balanced media coverage is the most pressing need. In the first round he controlled the television stations and newspapers, which ran only slurs about Mr. Toledo alongside worshipful coverage and paid advertisements touting Mr. Fujimori. Mr. Toledo's most recent rallies have made the nightly news, and the government has stopped the barrage of Fujimori ads. But the media are still heavily tilted toward Mr. Fujimori.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori must also stop abusing his incumbency. Peruvians who get food aid have been forced to attend Fujimori rallies and participate in the campaign. Many believe that the milk and rice will disappear if their neighborhoods vote for Mr. Toledo. The president must also insure that the balloting and vote count are free and transparent -- unlike the first round.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration and Congress helped persuade Mr. Fujimori to hold the second round. Washington must continue to stress to him that he risks being isolated internationally. The person leading the Organization of American States' observer mission in Peru, the former Guatemalan foreign minister Eduardo Stein, has been admirably frank about the campaign's problems.  The O.A.S. should continue to back him completely.</p>
        <p>The paradox is that Mr. Fujimori, as well as Peru, could benefit if he chose democracy. His hard-line security policies are popular in Peru, and he could well win a fair fight. If he wins a race widely perceived as rigged, however, he will not only be an international pariah but will face mass protests by Peruvians who seem newly energized to defend their rights.</p>
