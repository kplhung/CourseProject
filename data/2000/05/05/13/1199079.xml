        <p>The Devils and the Flyers each have four rookies who will play pivotal roles in the Eastern Conference finals that begin on Sunday in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Scott Gomez is the front-runner to win the Calder trophy as the National Hockey League's top rookie. Gomez, John Madden, Brian Rafalski and Colin White have produced seven goals in the Stanley Cup playoffs for the Devils and five have been game-winners.</p>
        <p>The Flyers' rookies have scored eight playoff goals, but only two have been game-winning goals, one each by Andy Delmore and Simon Gagne.</p>
        <p>With goaltender Brian Boucher leading the way, the Flyers' rookies have had a big impact in the regular season and the playoffs.</p>
        <p>While Boucher has been a revelation, Delmore has five goals in the playoffs, which is rather remarkable for a rookie defenseman.</p>
        <p>Gagne has three goals and Mark Eaton has also contributed a great deal to the Flyers, who will play host to Game 2 of this four-of-seven-game series on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The series shifts to East Rutherford, N.J., for Games 3 and 4 next Thursday and Saturday.</p>
        <p>Gomez, who led all rookies in scoring this season, and Rafalski of the Devils were named to the all-rookie team along with Boucher and Gagne of the Flyers. Mike York of the Rangers and Brad Stuart of San Jose also made the team.</p>
        <p>''This doesn't mean anything,'' Rafalski said of the honor. ''It doesn't matter what people think. All I want to do is win in the playoffs.''</p>
        <p>Rafalski, a defenseman, is the one rookie who will shoulder almost as much responsibility as Boucher in goal for the Flyers. Rafalski will team with Scott Stevens against John LeClair and Mark Recchi, Philadelphia's top two forwards.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't matter who I play against,'' Rafalski said. ''All kinds of people come across the line. I'll just try to play my game.''</p>
        <p>Boucher has played with inspiration since he took over from John Vanbiesbrouck as the Flyers' No. 1 goaltender in mid-January.</p>
        <p>He led the league in the regular season with a 1.91 goals against average in 35 games. He was the primary reason the Flyers were able to overtake the Devils in the final week of the season to be the top team in the Eastern Conference and to gain the home-ice advantage.</p>
        <p>Boucher has also been spectacular in the playoffs with a 1.73 goals against average, playing every minute for the Flyers.</p>
        <p>Only Martin Brodeur of the Devils, with a 1.51 goals against average, and Colorado's Patrick Roy, at 1.67, have better averages than Boucher's average.</p>
        <p>''Those were great moments for me, and that's what Brian Boucher is doing for his team now,'' Brodeur said after today's 90-minute practice. ''It's easier when you're a rookie because you're in there for the first time and you don't feel anything. When you get older, you get more responsible.''</p>
        <p>Coach Larry Robinson of the Devils admitted he was ''scared stiff'' when he played for the Canadiens as a rookie in the 1973 playoffs.</p>
        <p>That is one reason Robinson, who is enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame, avoids making an issue to his rookies about their responsibilities in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''If you don't have high expectations for them, they do well,'' Robinson said.</p>
        <p>Delmore and Gagne are tied for second with Gomez and Brenden Morrow of Dallas among rookies in playoff scoring with 6 points each.</p>
        <p>''The guy's hot,'' Gomez said about Delmore, who scored two goals in the regular season.</p>
