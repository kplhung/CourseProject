        <p>Carl C. Icahn has said he is willing to pay $22 a share, or about $6.5 billion, for Nabisco Group, which owns 80.6 percent of Nabisco Holdings, the maker of Ritz crackers and Mallomars</p>
        <p>Mr. Icahn, who earlier had offered to pay $16 a share for Nabisco, disclosed his plan in a regulatory filing on Thursday but stopped short of a formal offer. Under his proposal, which was also sent to the company, Nabisco Group shareholders would be paid $19 in cash and $3 a share in short-term debt, which Mr. Icahn says he would retire within two years through a refinancing or the sale of Nabisco assets.</p>
        <p>Nabisco Holdings has formally directed its management to pursue strategies that would maximize shareholder return, including a sale of the company. Many expect the company to be sold by summer. A company spokesman, Henry Sandbach, declined to comment yesterday on Mr. Icahn's proposal.</p>
        <p>Stock analysts called Mr. Icahn's price fair, given other bids for food companies, but said the bidding could go higher. Unilever has offered $18.4 billion for Bestfoods, the maker of Skippy peanut butter and Hellmann's mayonnaise, or about 12.4 times earnings. At that multiple, Nabisco Holdings would be worth $54 a share. Martin Feldman, a stock analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, said that would make Nabisco Group, whose sole asset is its stake in Nabisco Holdings, worth about $35 a share.</p>
        <p>Nabisco Group, which is the remnant of what was once RJR Nabisco, retains certain liabilities from its tobacco days, and the prospect of continuing litigation has depressed its stock price. Many industry analysts now expect it to sell its Nabisco Holdings shares and then look for a buyer for the holding company, which would be nothing more than a cash-filled shell.</p>
        <p>Early this year, Nabisco Group's shares were trading for less than $10. After the market digested Mr. Icahn's proposal, they rose $2.13 yesterday, to $19.69. Nabisco Holdings shares rose 37.5 cents, to $43.94, a 52-week high.</p>
        <p>''From Icahn's point of view, it's a win-win situation,'' said Nomi Ghez, who follows food company stocks for Goldman, Sachs. ''He already owns a lot of N.G.H. shares, and he can always turn around and sell.'' Mr. Icahn owns 9.57 percent of the company.</p>
        <p>At the annual meeting in Wilmington, Del., on Monday, the company's chairman, Steven F. Goldstone, began by telling the audience that he was unable to answer the many questions about the future ownership of the company because of legal concerns.</p>
        <p>Last March, Mr. Goldstone announced that he was breaking up RJR Nabisco, which years earlier was the subject of a fierce takeover battle that became a symbol of Wall Street's excesses in the 1980's. He sold the R. J. Reynolds' international tobacco division for $8 billion to Japan Tobacco, spun off the domestic tobacco business as R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, and left Nabisco shares in what was renamed the Nabisco Group. At the time, Mr. Icahn argued that the food business would still be subject to tobacco-lawsuit liability and that it made more sense to spin off the food business and leave the tobacco company as part of Nabisco Group.</p>
        <p>The latest proposal is a test of that strategy for Mr. Icahn, who has unsuccessfully sought control of the company four times. His last attempt, 14 months ago, included a short-lived proxy battle intended to force a spinoff of the food business.</p>
        <p>''It's sort of happening now, in a sense,'' Mr. Icahn said in an interview yesterday. ''The vindication is in the bottom line.'' Last spring, Mr. Icahn sold his 7.7 percent stake in RJR Nabisco, but soon after began buying stock in Nabisco Group and now owns 31 million shares.</p>
        <p>Although he has recently been acquiring stakes in other companies, including J. C. Penney, he said purchasing Nabisco was not intended to help pay for other investments. ''I just buy value,'' he said. ''One would not affect the others.''</p>
        <p>He added that he did not know whether he would keep the Nabisco Group if he is successful in his bid. But he said the company would certainly be sold ''one way or the other,'' and he would like to take control of it.</p>
        <p>''There will be synergistic bids,'' he said, ''but it would be great if we could get it at this level.''</p>
        <p>After acquiring all of Nabisco Group, Mr. Icahn plans to arrange a $7.5 billion loan through the Industrial Bank of Japan. With that, he would repay Nabisco Holdings' existing debt, which is about $3.6 billion. About $3.4 billion would be paid as a cash dividend to Nabisco Holdings' shareholders.</p>
        <p>Nabisco Group, as the majority holder, would wind up with about $2.7 billion. That $2.7 billion translates to about $19 in cash for each share of Nabsico Group. Shareholders would also get the two-year notes, which would have a face value of $3 and would carry a 14 percent coupon payable at maturity.</p>
