        <p>In Spain's corporate world, with its cozy relationships and closely knit elite, it might have seemed that Juan Villalonga's greatest asset as head of the national phone company was his boyhood friendship with the prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar. But Mr. Villalonga, the 47-year-old chairman of the company, Telefonica, has also made his way on his own.</p>
        <p>Recognizing that Telefonica lacks the size and revenue to compete in Europe, he has devoted much energy to expansion in Latin America -- which, as he sees it, has the added bonus of being a back door to North America. And, breaking with Telefonica's tradition as a unified national giant, he is spinning off businesses like cell phones and multimedia operations to cash in on investor appetite for technology stocks.</p>
        <p>In the process, Mr. Villalonga has made Telefonica a darling of investors. Since he took over in 1996, its shares -- lovingly called Matildas, after a 1970's television promotion in which a husband boasts to his wife, Matilda, that he just bought some -- have risen fivefold, hitting a high of $93 before falling back sharply in recent months. [The American depository receipts closed Friday at $65.1953, up $2.3516.]</p>
        <p>Carol L. Franklin, a portfolio manager at Scudder Kemper Investments, who holds Telefonica in her Scudder Greater Europe and Kemper New Europe funds, said Mr. Villalonga understands ''better than anyone else the whole value chain of the telecommunications business.''</p>
        <p>Despite his accomplishments, Mr. Villalonga is having trouble lately getting what he wants. To fortify Telefonica in Europe, he has set his sights on the new generation of cell phones, which feature an array of interactive devices, by bidding for licenses in Britain, Germany, France and Italy.</p>
        <p>His first effort, in Britain in April, ended badly when the company dropped out rather than top a $6.8 billion bid by Telesystem International Wireless of Canada. Earlier this month, Telefonica lost another opportunity, after bankers on its board, at the behest of the Spanish government, vetoed a $58 billion merger with the Dutch phone company Royal KPN, which would have created Europe's fourth-largest phone company, with a market capitalization of $125 billion.</p>
        <p>With that latest setback, Mr. Villalonga is being tested as never before -- and even faces questions about whether he can hang on to his job. But judging by his record, Mr. Villalonga is not likely to give up easily.</p>
        <p>Born in Madrid the son of a banker, he got a degree in management, then worked as a consultant at McKinsey before joining Credit Suisse First Boston and later Bankers Trust in Madrid.</p>
        <p>As an investment banker, Mr. Villalonga appears to have been no standout. A Madrid banker described him as ''good at opening doors'' for bankers who flew in from London and New York to manage deals in Spain.</p>
        <p>Along the way, though, he made the most of some early friendships. Mr. Villalonga's ties to Mr. Aznar, a high school classmate, paid off in 1996 when Mr. Aznar, freshly elected as prime minister, offered him Telefonica.</p>
        <p>The challenge was immense. European phone deregulation was around the corner, and Telefonica, known mainly for wrong numbers and months of waiting to get a phone, was scrambling to shape up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Villalonga, who is uncomfortable with the press and declined to be interviewed for this article, proved skillful at surrounding himself with good people. In an interview with Shere Hite for her recent book about the workplace, ''Sex and Business,'' he described himself as ''spending an important part of my time identifying talent.''</p>
        <p>He brought in trusted associates like Fernando Abril, a former J. P. Morgan banker, who became chief financial officer, and shifted managers. Recently, Mr. Abril was appointed to run the yellow pages unit, while another trusted associate, Juan Perea, who arrived with him as chief strategist, left the company.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Mr. Villalonga spent $5 billion for stakes in Brazilian phone companies after the breakup of the national phone company, and this January he began a $21 billion all-stock tender offer for full ownership of the companies in Brazil, plus others in Argentina and Peru. In November, he spun off a third of Terra Networks, Telefonica's Internet service provider, which became Europe's fastest-growing Internet stock. Earlier, he sold 37 percent of the yellow pages publisher.</p>
        <p>Not satisfied with just owning distribution, he also wants to control content. In March, he offered $5.4 billion for the hot Dutch television production company Endemol. This month, Telefonica said it was in talks with about 20 Spanish-language television groups in the Americas, including Univision Communications, the No. 1 Spanish network in the United States. A media company will ultimately be spun off, he says.</p>
        <p>While the breakup may be unusual for a Spanish corporation, the drive across the Atlantic is not. Beginning in the 1980's, Spanish utilities, television companies and banks -- exploiting linguistic, cultural and historical  ties -- rushed into Latin America as governments there liberalized their economies. Prisa, the media group that competes with Telefonica in the Spanish-language Internet business, plans to sell 25 percent of its shares to the public in June, in part to raise cash for Latin America.</p>
        <p>And despite the region's volatility, the investments are paying off. Banco Santander Central Hispano, a pioneer in Latin America, expects $1 billion in profit there this year, on top of $600 million in 1999.</p>
        <p>Mr. Villalonga's razzle-dazzle has occasionally put him at loggerheads with minority shareholders. Pension funds holding shares in the Latin American subsidiaries protested when crucial assets, like Internet services, were merged with Terra. Mr. Villalonga's buyout of the junior shareholders with Telefonica stock in January mended bridges with institutional investors.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Mr. Villalonga has been much in the gossip columns lately after separating from his wife, with whom he has two children, and reportedly dating Adriana Abascal, a former Mexican beauty queen and widow of the Mexican television executive Emilio Azcarraga Milmo.</p>
        <p>The Aznar and Villalonga families are close, and Mr. Villalonga's marital problems have not helped a cooling of relations with Mr. Aznar. Mr. Villalonga became a liability for the prime minister in his recent successful re-election campaign after it was disclosed that Telefonica had provided stock options worth $190 million to 100 top executives, provoking charges of cronyism. To disarm critics, Mr. Villalonga spread the options to 90,000 employees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Villalonga's influence, though, has flourished even as government control declined. In 1997, the government sold its last 21 percent stake in Telefonica, though it retained a ''golden share'' enabling it to sway big decisions.</p>
        <p>Long before Mr. Villalonga brought his flair, Telefonica had begun its international push. In the late 1980's, the looming liberalization of the European market prompted the company to seek fresh markets abroad. Latin America offered opportunities, as Argentina, under Carlos Saul Menem, and Mexico, under Carlos Salinas de Gortari, overhauled their economies, and Chile marched out of the Pinochet years to more liberal economic rules.</p>
        <p>Telefonica's chairman then, Luis Solana -- a well-connected manager whose brother, Javier Solana, was foreign minister and later secretary general of NATO -- pushed into the region, acquiring stakes in phone companies in Chile, Argentina, Peru, Mexico and Brazil. The company faced scant competition from North American competitors, who viewed Latin America as too risky.</p>
        <p>''Now, everybody wants to go there, but then people often told us we were crazy,'' said Ignacio Santillana, a former associate of Luis Solana and head of Prisa's Internet group. ''But governments in the region were fighting to get our investment.''</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Villalonga, Latin America became a centerpiece of Telefonica's strategy. Analysts say he showed boldness, but also financial acumen, in Brazil's economic crisis. ''Instead of going on the defensive, he became more aggressive,'' said Lucia Granda, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in Madrid. And by delaying payment of 40 percent of the purchase price of the assets of the national phone company, then investing the money in dollar-denominated Brazilian bonds, Mr. Villalonga nearly doubled his investment when measured in Brazilian reais.</p>
        <p>To be sure, Mr. Villalonga's strategies are not without risk. For all Telefonica's strength in South America, it remains a relative dwarf in Europe and North America. Indeed, some analysts say Telefonica's limited successes may succeed only in making it a takeover target.</p>
        <p>Mr. Santillana of Prisa noted that while roughly a quarter of Latin American telecommunications traffic and commerce is within the region, and 60 percent is with North America, links with Europe remain negligible. On the other hand, 80 percent of Spanish phone traffic is with neighbors like France, Italy and Germany. ''Telefonica and Spain belong to Europe,'' he said. ''Telefonica and Spain have to dedicate their time to being European players.''</p>
        <p>The failed bids in Britain and the Netherlands illustrate how difficult executing that strategy is going to be.</p>
        <p>Moreover, despite Telefonica's efforts at acquiring content providers, like Endemol, not all analysts are convinced that that is the way to spend limited resources. ''The best distribution platforms will be able to attract content without necessarily owning them,'' said Ms. Granda of Merrill Lynch.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Villalonga keeps convincing investors.</p>
        <p>As technologies continue to integrate, said James S. Byrd, an asset manager who holds Telefonica shares in his Fortis International Equity and Fortis Global Growth funds, ''content is going to be the thing, and he is trying to position Telefonica.'' As for Latin America, he said, ''when you look at where unit growth is around the world, it's going to be there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Villalonga could not agree more. ''The production of content is going to become, in a short time, the field of activity with the greatest level of return,'' he told shareholders in April. As for geography, he said, if Telefonica has strategic value, ''it is due to its position in Latin America.''</p>
