        <p>Re ''Microsoft Offers Alternative Plan in Antitrust Case'' (front page, May 11):</p>
        <p>Microsoft has been quick to promote its value not only to consumers but also to the economy as it seeks to quell the government's demand that the company be broken up. Are its executives so naive as to believe that we consumers are not aware that it is the ubiquity and interoperability of Microsoft's operating systems and software that make viruses like the ''I Love You'' virus not only easy but also inviting to write?</p>

        <p>Microsoft professes to be concerned about the effects on the economy if it is broken up. I'm more concerned about the effects on the economy if it isn't.</p>
