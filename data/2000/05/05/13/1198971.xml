        <p>In a sane musical world, the magnificence of Olivier Messiaen's opera ''St. Francis of Assisi'' would long since have overwhelmed the difficulties of putting it on. But nearly two decades after the work's first performance, it has still not been staged in the United States, nor has there even been a full concert performance. So tonight's presentation at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, when the Brooklyn Philharmonic will play three crucial scenes from the opera, is an especially welcome opportunity to hear, and feel, some of the most glorious music of the last quarter century.</p>
        <p>The reluctance of American orchestras and opera companies to put on ''St. Francis'' is easy to understand, if not to condone. Not only does the complete score play for four hours, discounting intermissions, but it also requires enormous choral and orchestral resources: a choir of 150 and an orchestra of 119, including a whole suborchestra of woodwinds and a large percussion ensemble. Besides all that, it needs a baritone of enormous strength and stamina to sing St. Francis, who appears in seven of the eight scenes, and a soprano of perfection and simplicity to embody the Angel.</p>

        <p>In a sane musical world, the magnificence of Olivier Messiaen's opera ''St. Francis of Assisi'' would long since have overwhelmed the difficulties of putting it on. But nearly two decades after the work's first performance, it has still not been staged in the United States, nor has there even been a full concert performance. So tonight's presentation at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, when the Brooklyn Philharmonic will play three crucial scenes from the opera, is an especially welcome opportunity to hear, and feel, some of the most glorious music of the last quarter century.</p>
        <p>The reluctance of American orchestras and opera companies to put on ''St. Francis'' is easy to understand, if not to condone. Not only does the complete score play for four hours, discounting intermissions, but it also requires enormous choral and orchestral resources: a choir of 150 and an orchestra of 119, including a whole suborchestra of woodwinds and a large percussion ensemble. Besides all that, it needs a baritone of enormous strength and stamina to sing St. Francis, who appears in seven of the eight scenes, and a soprano of perfection and simplicity to embody the Angel.</p>
        <p>But these features of size and scale are also partly responsible for the work's beauty and power, by which they are more than justified. The work is a celebration of St.  Francis as spiritual hero, and the title role is intended to be a heroic task in itself: only that way could the character onstage live up to his historical prototype. As for the colossal choral-orchestral forces, they have to be available because the work is also a celebration of sound, covering a huge spectrum of tones, textures and colors, prompted by the brilliance of natural resonances and the melodic exuberance of bird song.</p>
        <p>The story of the opera is a story of pain and sacrifice. St. Francis is seen preaching the virtues of poverty and humiliation, caring for a leper to the point of embracing him  and accepting physical suffering in the extreme degree of the stigmata (the wounds of Christ on the Cross). The more he denies himself, the greater his spiritual triumph, and for Messiaen the triumph was what had to be expressed. While St. Francis and the other soloists converse in a kind of chant, the orchestra and chorus roar with huge gestures of affirmation and attainment.</p>
        <p>Of the three scenes to be performed in Brooklyn, two have never been played in this country before. They are the scenes in which the Angel has a central part: ''The Journeying Angel'' and ''The Angel Musician.'' In the first, the Angel arrives at the young Franciscan monastery at a time when St. Francis is away by himself, meditating. (This is the one scene without him.) The Angel knocks at the door, and an outburst of orchestral chords is heard, in an insistent rhythm: the presence of a celestial being comes as a shock to the earthly order.</p>
        <p>Even so, the monks do not recognize the Angel as anything out of the ordinary. The heavenly visitor, unnoticed, can thereby discern the monks' true natures. He asks them questions. One is impatient. Another answers carefully. The Angel passes on, to find, in the next scene, St. Francis singing phrases from the real St. Francis's ''Canticle of the Sun,'' after which he asks for a glimpse of the life to come. At this the Angel appears, and prepares to give St. Francis this glimpse in auditory form. The Angel  takes up a viol (Messiaen was influenced by the portrayals of angels in the paintings of Fra Angelico) and tunes his instrument, provoking rainbows of glistening harmonics in the orchestral strings.</p>
        <p>For the music of heaven, then, Messiaen offers a serene melody in the unearthly sounds of three electronic instruments, projected around the auditorium, with orchestra and choir in support. The saint passes out, and is discovered by his fellow monks.</p>
        <p>The Brooklyn performance then cuts to the final scene, ''Death and the New Life.''  Surrounded by his monks, St. Francis bids farewell to the world and dies. Just before he does so, the Angel reappears to help him into heaven, and the scene ends with a tremendous chorale for chorus and orchestra, reaching blazing C major on the last word of the composer's own libretto: ''joy.''</p>
        <p>In some of its musical imagery -- its closeness to chant and its blissful rich consonances -- ''St. Francis'' comes out of the French Catholic tradition, but Messiaen was never narrowly dogmatic. The great message of his opera is one of rejoicing, of thanksgiving and of meeting eternity in the here and now, which his music achieves by slow tempos, ecstatic delirium and intense presence.</p>
        <p>Robert Spano will conduct the orchestra and a cast led by David Wilson-Johnson, who had the composer's blessing for his performance of the title role. Heidi Grant Murphy is the Angel.</p>
