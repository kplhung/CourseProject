        <p>Vice President Al Gore stepped into two contentious local issues in Oregon today, saying that he would ''work for a quick resolution'' on whether to breach the Snake River dams to protect endangered salmon, and, according to a key Democrat, saying he was opposed to the state's law allowing assisted suicide.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore read a statement on the salmon issue that did not hint at his own view.</p>
        <p>In the past Mr. Gore has said that the issue of assisted suicide should be left to the states.</p>
        <p>But today, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said the vice president told him that he opposed assisted suicide. Oregon has passed a law allowing assisted suicide, but Republicans in Congress are trying to overturn it.</p>
        <p>Senator Wyden met Mr. Gore at the airport here, and they sat together in the back of the vice-presidential limousine on their way to Portland Community College, where Mr. Gore was giving a speech on Social Security.</p>
        <p>''He talked to me in the limousine,'' Mr. Wyden told reporters later. ''He said he's against assisted suicide'' but that he did not want to interfere with the ability of doctors to manage a patient's pain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was not available to reporters to clarify his views.</p>
        <p>Last month, the vice president was asked in a satellite interview with an Oregon television station whether he supported Oregon's law.</p>
        <p>''That's an example of an issue that should be left to the states,'' Mr. Gore said on April 20. ''I think that states should have the discretion to explore this new set of issues involving what role doctors should play when a patient is in extremis at the end of life. You know, any family that's been in that kind of situation knows that doctors sometimes have experience that could be brought to bear usefully. You know, there are so many different situations, I think that states ought to deal with that on their own.''</p>
        <p>Local Democrats have been urging Mr. Gore to take a leadership role on some of these polarizing local matters. He was greeted today by a front-page article in The Oregonian in which the governor, John Kitzhaber, who supported Mr. Gore's opponent, former Senator Bill Bradley, in the Democratic presidential primaries, said he did not understand why Mr. Gore had not spoken out on the salmon issue.</p>
        <p>''What baffles me is his continued silence on this issue,'' the article quoted Mr. Kitzhaber as saying.</p>
        <p>The article also said Gore advisers were insistent that the vice president would not speak out on the matter because he wanted to focus attention on Social Security.</p>
        <p>The salmon issue revolves around the question of whether to breach dams on the Snake River as a way of helping to preserve endangered species of salmon. The Army Corps of Engineers is studying whether to proposed such a measure, which is strongly opposed by many people as an assault on the area's agricultural economy.</p>
        <p>Before his speech on Social Security, Mr. Gore read a statement about salmon, criticizing his Republican opponent's position on the issue, but saying that his own mind was not made up.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, Gov. George W. Bush has prejudged the outcome,'' Mr. Gore said in the statement he read to about 200 people, referring to Mr. Bush's statement last year that he would oppose any effort to breach the dams.</p>
        <p>''I feel it is irresponsible to make a decision or draw a conclusion without consulting all of the parties involved and without utilizing hard science,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>''I pledge to work for a quick resolution that would involve all of the affected parties based on hard science, and I refuse to prejudge or play politics with this issue. We can develop a plan that can both protect the rivers and restore the salmon runs. Extinction here is not an option.''</p>
        <p>Bob Applegate, a spokesman for Governor Kitzhaber, said he believed that the statement was ''extremely helpful'' and he praised Mr. Gore for suggesting he would take a leadership role in helping to resolve the matter.</p>
        <p>''Right now we have utter gridlock, the kind that only a president can break,'' Mr. Applegate said.</p>
        <p>Oregon, which has voted Democratic recently, has been less hospitable to Mr. Gore than it has been to President Clinton. Recent polls here show Mr. Bush with a slight edge.</p>
