        <p>China's top foreign exchange regulator died on Wednesday, Chinese officials confirmed today, after falling from a seventh-floor hospital window.</p>
        <p>Hong Kong newspapers called the death of Li Fuxiang, 47, director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, a suicide, prompted either by his failing health or a corruption investigation centering on one of Mr. Li's predecessors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Li was widely respected and not known to be involved in any wrongdoing. He had entered the hospital in Beijing several days earlier, the Hong Kong papers said, variously reporting that he suffered from diabetes, heart disease or depression.</p>
        <p>But almost as remarkable as the mystery surrounding Mr. Li's death was the extraordinary back door through which the news emerged: an anonymous posting in a chat room on a popular Chinese Web site.</p>
        <p>Under the heading ''Especially Big News,'' the item popped up on Sina.com Thursday at 10:27 p.m.: ''Director of State Administration of Foreign Exchange Li Fuxiang committed suicide on May 10. Reason for incident is under investigation. Believe there is astonishing background.''</p>
        <p>It is the latest example of how Chinese are getting news from the Internet that the tightly controlled state press will not print.</p>
        <p>The government was clearly not prepared to release the news today, and confusion reigned for much of the day, as government news offices, when asked about the reports, said they were ''looking into'' them. But officials close to the administration confirmed that Mr. Li had died in a probable suicide.</p>
        <p>All print and broadcast media in China are owned and tightly controlled by the state, which restricts even privately owned Chinese Web sites to running news reports only from the state press. But the government has had a much tougher time figuring out how to effectively regulate the freewheeling discussions that occur regularly in Internet chat rooms.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Li's death is determined to be a suicide, and related to corruption, it could have a profound effect on China's finance world. One of his predecessors at the Foreign Exchange Administration, Zhu Xiaohua, is being investigated in connection with possible corruption at the state-owned China Everbright Bank. If wrongdoing is found to extend into the administration, which controls billions of dollars of foreign currency, it would be a great embarrassment to the government.</p>
