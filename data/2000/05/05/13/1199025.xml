        <p>Among the dignitaries who gathered earlier this month in the white marble grandeur of the Folger Shakespeare Library on Capitol Hill to pay tribute to Senator Connie Mack was the chief executive of Merck &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>Merck, the giant drug company that was the host of the glittering dinner to honor the retiring Florida Republican senator and his wife, Priscilla, capped the evening by making a surprise $250,000 donation to the University of Florida Genetics Institute, which eventually is to be named in honor of the Macks, two crusaders against cancer.</p>
        <p>The celebration marking Senator Mack's approaching retirement was attended by 60 guests, including the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi; a handful of Senate colleagues; the chief executive of Merck, Raymond V. Gilmartin; and the television personalities Sam Donaldson and Paula Zahn.</p>
        <p>To those at the dinner, the announced donation by Merck was a generous gift that could make a difference in using genetics to cure diseases. But watchdog groups saw the gift a bit differently: as an effort by the multinational pharmaceutical manufacturer to curry favor on Capitol Hill while Congress is considering a Medicare prescription drug benefit and other issues critical to the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
        <p>''It is absolutely a way to ingratiate themselves with the powers that be in a real special way, more special than a campaign contribution,'' said Charles Lewis, director of the Center for Public Integrity. ''It is very difficult to forget something like that.''</p>
        <p>The charitable contribution to the university in Gainesville, Fla., was perfectly legal and may even qualify for a 50 percent match from the State of Florida. But critics say such large charitable gifts to honor sitting lawmakers are on the rise, and they can present a subtle way to influence policy through contributions that are  greater than campaign finance rules allow without outside disclosure.</p>
        <p>In the case of Senator Mack, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate and a member of the Finance Committee, Merck's announced gift came when the senator still has six months in office, and it was presented in front of other powerful lawmakers. All of them could be faced this year with difficult decisions on whether to add a drug benefit to Medicare or to limit the prices that drug manufacturers can charge for their products.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mack, like other Republican leaders in the Senate, has backed only a limited proposal for providing prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries for low-income elderly people only. (President Clinton's proposal for drug coverage would be offered to all recipients.)</p>
        <p>Senator Mack shares the drug industry's opposition to price controls, saying such restrictions could dry up money needed for research into new drug therapies.</p>
        <p>The senator was unaware that Merck intended to make the donation until the dinner, a spokeswoman for Mr. Mack, Nancy Segerdahl, said, and will not be influenced by it.</p>
        <p>Merck dismissed the idea that it was seeking legislative favors through the donation, and a company spokesman said the gift was meant to commemorate the cancer-fighting work of the Macks. The senator, who had melanoma, is a leading advocate of increased federal spending for medical research. His wife, who has had breast cancer, is an organizer of the Race for the Cure.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, we thought it was an appropriate recognition of the commitment he and his wife have displayed to basic biomedical research,'' the Merck spokesman, Greg Reaves, said.</p>
        <p>Randy Moore, a lobbyist for the University of Florida, which is seeking money for the genetics center, said, ''This was nothing more or less than a generous, heartfelt gesture to someone they believe has made a great contribution to the public weal.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore said he was approached by Merck with the idea for the tribute to the Macks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reaves said the grant to the university from the company's foundation, which distributes more than $200 million a year, was consistent with Merck's support of genome research. He also noted that the money would not become available until Senator Mack left office.</p>
        <p>''The problem here is this becomes an opportunity for a company with major interests before the Congress to provide financial support for something that is obviously important for Senator Mack, even though it is not for him directly,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a group advocating an overhaul of campaign finance laws.</p>
        <p>Merck, with its headquarters in Warehouse Station, N.J., manufactures and distributes many health products as well as pharmaceuticals, and had earnings of more than $5.2 billion last year. The company has contributed more than $150,000 to political candidates and $50,000 in unregulated ''soft money'' in the current election cycle, mainly to Republicans, the Center for Responsive Politics says. But records show that Senator Mack has received no donations from Merck or its employees in the past.</p>
        <p>The University of Florida is trying to raise $60 million to build and staff the new genetics center, and has received more than $5.6 million thus far, including a single $2 million gift from an individual and $1.5 million in seed money from Congress.</p>
        <p>Florida lawmakers are asking Congress this year to appropriate $15 million for the institute. Senator Mack has recused himself from lobbying for the appropriation, which is being championed by Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida.</p>
        <p>The propriety of charitable giving to lawmakers' favored causes has drawn attention as the practice has appeared to increase in recent years. An institute at the University of Mississippi named for Senator Lott has attracted substantial corporate support, including several million-dollar pledges, as have several other centers named for current and former lawmakers.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 16, 2000, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about a donation to the University of Florida Genetics Institute by Merck &amp; Company, the drug maker, misstated the name of its headquarters community in New Jersey. It is Whitehouse Station, not Warehouse Station.</p>
