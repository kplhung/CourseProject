        <p>One of Margaret Pataki's proudest memories is of her son George,  when he was first able to lift a strawberry basket.</p>
        <p>The governor was just a toddler when he became a basket boy on the family farm. When it was full, he would fetch another basket. Little George was always an angel, his mother says.</p>
        <p>Alfonse M. D'Amato, the former senator, likes vegetables. But his mother, Antoinette D'Amato, 85, says he is spoiled. The only tomato sauce he likes is the one made from  tomatoes in her yard in Island Park, N.Y.</p>
        <p>And Bernadette Castro, the commissioner of parks for New York State? She probably wouldn't be where she is today if her parents could have afforded to hire Shirley Temple to star in their commercials for the family furniture store. Just ask her mother, Theresa Castro, 83.</p>
        <p>''Talk about a power lunch,'' said the younger Ms. Castro, addressing the 75 or so political mothers here today for their fifth Momfest, a fund-raiser for breast cancer research at which they celebrate their personal service to public servants. ''The mothers who are here really have more influence than one could imagine.''</p>
        <p>''The moms are always the unsung heroes, in particular for political candidates,'' Ms. Castro said. ''I don't mean to sound like a feminist, but when it comes to the end of the day, the buck still stops with a mom.''</p>
        <p>Most in attendance were Republicans and most were from Long Island, but not all were the mothers  of politicians. A few were Girl Scout leaders or politicians themselves.</p>
        <p>The talk among the mothers was not about campaigns or politics. They chatted about food and boasted about grandchildren.</p>
        <p>Their children in politics were like all their children, they said, and not favored over their less public siblings. Not wanting to boast, the mothers refused to take credit (or blame) for the paths of their offspring.</p>
        <p>Ms. Castro has four children and four grandchildren. But she went to the event, at the Carlyle on the Green in Bethpage State Park, to honor her own mother, who helped start the family business, Castro Convertibles, then turned to civic and charitable interests.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Pataki spoke for many when she said, ''We're not political.''</p>
        <p>''Our sons are, but we're not,'' said Mrs. Pataki, 84, who has lived with her son and daughter-in-law, Libby Pataki, for the last four years in Garrison in Putnam County.</p>
        <p>''I never had any trouble from the day he was born,'' Mrs. Pataki said. ''He is a very good son. When he leaves in the morning he passes my door and he says, 'Goodbye, nice grandma,' and I say, 'Goodbye, dear lovable son.'</p>
        <p>''It's sweet. But he's working for the state and he's not home much.''</p>
        <p>But some routines have changed.  Mrs. Pataki said she looked forward to eating hot dogs and hamburgers at a barbecue on Mother's Day with her children and six grandchildren. And she couldn't wait to watch her son and daughter-in-law cook, despite his efforts  to goad her into cooking.</p>
        <p>''My son said, 'My mother makes the best stuffed cabbage.' I didn't hear him. 'My mother makes the best beef stew.' I didn't hear him. 'My mother makes the best apple pie.' I didn't hear him. I'm not cooking anymore.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. D'Amato, 85, said her son was taking her out for Mother's Day. The restaurant's location will be a surprise.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato lives only five minutes away from her home in Island Park, his mother said. He stops by for dinner a few times a week.</p>
        <p>''Being together, we know what it feels like when our sons or our dear ones are working hard for the people,'' she said. ''My son worked very hard, and now he's enjoying life. He started to learn how to play golf and he's doing well.''</p>
        <p>Olive Lazio, 75, the mother of Representative Rick A. Lazio, said the whole family was coming to her house in West Islip on Sunday. That includes her four children and their spouses, seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Mr. Lazio, who represents western Suffolk County in Congress, will man the barbecue.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lazio called her son a sweetheart. He developed his knack for politics by counting the votes and marking the tally on the board at Republican headquarters as a child, working alongside his father.</p>
        <p>She said Mr. Lazio, the youngest of her children, confided in her but did not ask her advice. And she, unlike him, shuns the limelight. She was too shy to read aloud a note he had written her on Mother's Day last year. But this year, as a political mother, she did have her own comment to make.</p>
        <p>''He's very caring, a wonderful husband, a wonderful father and a wonderful son,'' she said. She noted that her son was waiting for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to make his move before deciding whether to enter the Senate race.</p>
        <p>''There is nobody more qualified than him right now,'' she said. ''He's got the brains, he's got the brawn and the love.''</p>
