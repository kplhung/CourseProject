        <p>Mike Jarvis, the St. John's basketball coach, has met with Michael Jordan to discuss the Washington Wizards' head-coaching job, a person familiar with the meeting said.</p>
        <p>Jarvis and Jordan, the head of basketball operations for the Wizards, informally discussed the possibility of Jarvis becoming the team's coach during a three-hour meeting Tuesday night in New York. No offer was made, and the meeting was characterized as more of an opportunity for both parties to feel each other out.</p>
        <p>Neither Rob Ades, the agent for Jarvis, nor Jordan could be reached to comment. But Jordan is said to be interested in filling the Wizards' vacant position before the May 21 National Basketball Association draft lottery. Jarvis was en route to Boston this weekend.</p>
        <p>The St. John's athletic director, Ed Manetta Jr., said he and Jarvis had an agreement about future offers: the coach would notify him if discussions are under way. ''When Mike is ready to tell me something is going on, he will,'' Manetta said. ''As of today, he hasn't told me anything.''</p>
