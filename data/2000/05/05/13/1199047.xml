        <p>A federal judge dismissed three lawsuits against a planned water filtration plant in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx yesterday, allowing the city to go forward with construction of a project that has been assailed by community groups and environmentalists as a misuse of public parkland.</p>
        <p>The plant, which would be built under the Moshulu Golf Course, is intended to filter 10 percent of the city's water. But construction of the plant would require the golf course to be closed for five years as engineers sank filtration equipment underground. The project was vigorously opposed by Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, as well as by the local planning board and several members of the community.</p>
        <p>Neighborhood advocates, park users and environmentalists, not to mention golfers, have long asserted that the project would destroy precious green space, raise water rates, inflict noise, pollution and traffic on a fragile urban neighborhood, and even raise asthma rates.</p>
        <p>The judge who made yesterday's ruling, Nina Gershon of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, rejected the claims of the four plaintiffs -- the state attorney general's office and three community groups -- that state legislation was necessary for the filtration plant to be built on city parkland.</p>
        <p>Officials of the Parks Council and the Friends of Van Cortlandt Park said they would probably appeal Judge Gershon's decision. Juanita Scarlett, a spokeswoman for Eliot L. Spitzer, the attorney general, said  the state was reviewing the court order and would soon decide what to do.</p>
        <p>The three private groups that joined the state in the suit were the Parks Council, the Friends of Van Cortlandt Park and Norwood Community Action.</p>
        <p>''We are dismayed and very concerned about the precedent that would be set by taking over 20 acres of parkland for the construction of this chemical treatment plant of over a million square feet,'' said Elizabeth Cook, executive director of the Parks Council. ''Although the city says the plant will be underground, it will protrude well over 30 feet above existing ground level and permanently change the terrain of the park.''</p>
        <p>The city was under a federal court order to pick a site for the plant, which will filter water from the Croton Aqueduct system.  Federal officials had sued the city in 1997 to force it to filter water from the aqueduct, which they said contained traces of potentially dangerous microorganisms. The city has never filtered its water, relying instead on chlorine treatment.</p>
        <p>In December 1998, the city settled on a driving range adjacent to the Mosholu Golf Course as the site for the plant.</p>
        <p>Michael D. Hess, the city's corporation counsel, said that if the lawsuits had not been decided in the city's favor yesterday, the project would have been delayed, making it difficult to comply with the federal court order.</p>
        <p>''It is an incredibly important win with respect to the improvement of the quality of the water in the Croton system,'' Mr. Hess said.</p>
        <p>City officials said the Mosholu Golf Course, which was built in 1914, would close at the end of 2001 and remain closed for five years as the project was  completed. They said the plant would be built under 30 acres of the 74-acre golf course. When it was completed,  its roof would be covered with soil, allowing the course and driving range to be reopened.</p>
        <p>Joel A. Miele Sr., commissioner of the city Department of Environmental Protection, said the plant, which will treat 200 million gallons of water a day, would cost $680 million to build and $100 million a year to operate. The city intends to spend a $48 million more to compensate for the closure of Mosholu Golf Course by subsidizing greens fees at other golf courses and running shuttle buses from the Bronx to other fairways around the city.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the project were unimpressed by the city's concessions.</p>
        <p>''If I was a golfer, that might be something,'' Mr. Ferrer said. ''But it totally misses the larger issue, which is the alienation of parkland. This isn't the alteration of a hill or a dale or a gully or a tree. It's building a building underground that's six football fields long.''</p>
        <p>In her order, Judge Gershon considered whether the project was ''compatible with public park purposes'' and found that it was. Opponents of the plan disputed that.</p>
        <p>''This plant will use over 63,000 tons of chemicals a day and will produce over 25,000 tons sludge a day,'' Ms. Cook said. ''This is a new kind of entity. There is nothing like it anywhere around New York City.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cook suggested building the plant in a little-used industrial area in Westchester County, which she acknowledged would be more expensive than building it in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''But it's well worth the extra money,'' she said, ''to build the plant in an appropriate site and to protect irreplaceable parkland.''</p>
