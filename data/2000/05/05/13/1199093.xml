        <p>Greg LeMond, widely considered America's greatest cyclist, will pay his first visit to the United States Cycling Hall of Fame next month to help raise money for the institution, which was founded in 1987 in Somerville, N.J.</p>
        <p>LeMond, who won world championships in 1983 and 1990 and is the only American to win more than one Tour de France -- he won three, in 1986, '89 and '90 -- was not even at the Hall of Fame for his induction in 1996, which was marked by a ceremony in Trexlertown, Pa., where Olympic trials were being conducted.</p>

        <p>Greg LeMond, widely considered America's greatest cyclist, will pay his first visit to the United States Cycling Hall of Fame next month to help raise money for the institution, which was founded in 1987 in Somerville, N.J.</p>
        <p>LeMond, who won world championships in 1983 and 1990 and is the only American to win more than one Tour de France -- he won three, in 1986, '89 and '90 -- was not even at the Hall of Fame for his induction in 1996, which was marked by a ceremony in Trexlertown, Pa., where Olympic trials were being conducted.</p>
        <p>So the presence of the retired champion for the 2000 induction ceremony is a special occasion for the cycling hall, which gets about 2,000 visitors a year, mostly during the annual Tour of Somerville, to be held next Saturday.</p>
        <p>''It's something maybe I'm ashamed to say, I haven't been to the Cycling Hall of Fame,'' LeMond, 38, of Minneapolis, said during a teleconference yesterday. ''I owe what I am to cycling.''</p>
        <p>LeMond will speak at a dinner on June 2, when five cyclists will be inducted and then participate in a 20-mile fun ride the next morning. Proceeds from the fun ride will help the Hall of Fame complete its move from a 900-square-foot storefront on Main Street in Somerville, to a 3,600-square-foot space across the street.</p>
