        <p>Anne M. Mulcahy, the new president and chief operating officer at the Xerox Corporation, is often mistaken for Carleton S. Fiorina, the chief executive of the Xerox archrival, Hewlett-Packard. And Ms. Mulcahy gets a huge kick out of playing off the parallels.</p>
        <p>Last year, when The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle quoted Ms. Fiorina as saying there were no glass ceilings, Ms. Mulcahy wrote an angry response citing the low number of women in technology companies. And at a recent Xerox management meeting, Ms. Mulcahy did what Xerox insiders said was a hilarious skewering of Ms. Fiorina and Hewlett's advertising campaigns.</p>
        <p>''I've never met Carly,'' Ms. Mulcahy said. ''But Hewlett is the 800-pound gorilla in the printer space, and if I can use the idea of an Anne-Carly face-off to poke fun at its leader, well, why not?''</p>
        <p>It may soon be a face-off of true equals. Ms. Mulcahy, 47, has long been the highest-ranking woman at Xerox, most recently as president of the company's general markets organization -- a $6 billion business, started in January 1999, that concentrates on selling Xerox products to small businesses and consumers.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, the Xerox board ousted its chief executive, G. Richard Thoman, and gave Ms. Mulcahy her new titles. Although Paul A. Allaire, the chairman of Xerox and Mr. Thoman's predecessor, is retaking the chief executive slot for now, Ms. Mulcahy is the clear heir apparent. ''Anne is the best line operator we have,'' Mr. Allaire said.</p>
        <p>Xerox certainly needs operational help. A sales force reorganization and back-office consolidation have left the company in chaos, even as competitors like Hewlett-Packard and Canon Inc. have nibbled away at its markets. Its stock price, well over a split-adjusted $50 a share two years ago, has been in free fall. The shares shot up $1.50 yesterday, closing at $27.</p>
        <p>It will be Ms. Mulcahy's task to remotivate the sales force, speed digital products and services to market and lower costs.</p>
        <p>''I participated in developing the company's strategies, and I will have a relentless focus on executing them,'' Ms. Mulcahy said.</p>
        <p>If and when Ms. Mulcahy, a 24-year Xerox veteran, gets the top job, she and Ms. Fiorina will be the only two women in chief executive slots in the document-processing industry. That does not leave Ms. Mulcahy with a lot of women as role models. But that has never stopped her.</p>
        <p>''My upbringing was my greatest advantage,'' Ms. Mulcahy said. ''I was comfortable around men, and I learned to love contention.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mulcahy's father was an English professor turned editor who loved playing with words and ideas; her mother was a homemaker who handled the family's money.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mulcahy was the only daughter among their four children, but she held her own while growing up in East Rockaway, N.Y. ''She wouldn't let us exclude her from anything, even shooting basketball hoops,'' recalled her oldest brother, Thomas J. Dolan, who is president of the global solutions group at Xerox. ''Dinnertime in our home was a time for debating ideas, and Anne was as outspoken as the rest of us.''</p>
        <p>Still, she remembered being curious about what a male-free environment would be like. So she enrolled in the all-women Marymount College in Tarrytown, N.Y., and hated it so much that she left after her junior year to join Vista, a government program that is the domestic equivalent of the Peace Corps. Only after 15 months working with preschool children, prisoners and juvenile delinquents in poor areas of Kentucky did she return to Marymount to get a joint degree in journalism and math.</p>
        <p>For about a nanosecond, she thought about being a reporter. ''I took a tryout at Cosmo and got weeded out real quick,'' she recalled. So she took a job in the training department at Chase Manhattan Bank.</p>
        <p>Soon after, she moved to Boston to join her husband, Charles Roy, and she applied at Xerox for a job selling copiers. ''I never thought of it as a lifetime decision,'' she recalled.</p>
        <p>Although on paper she had few qualifications for the job, Thomas A. Horne, then a Boston sales manager, hired her. ''She was the first woman on our sales team,'' said Mr. Horne, now a Xerox vice president. ''But she seemed professional, organized, and I just sensed she was committed to being successful.''</p>
        <p>She and Mr. Roy divorced three years later. In 1980 she met Joe Mulcahy, a regional sales manager for Xerox in New York, on a company ski trip. A year later they married, and Ms. Mulcahy joined her husband in New York. In 1983 she gave birth to their first son, Michael; the second, Kevin, was born in 1987. Mr. Mulcahy retired from Xerox three years ago.</p>
        <p>''Our kids are the center of our lives,'' Ms. Mulcahy said.</p>
        <p>Though Ms. Mulcahy never took long maternity leaves, her friends say it was no easy choice. As her best friend, Ellen A. Milano, vice president of New England Biomedical Research, put it, ''We both went back to work within a few months of having our kids, and we still talk a lot about balancing relationships, family and full-time careers.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mulcahy developed a truly eclectic resume at Xerox as her children were growing up. She held jobs in sales, sales management, marketing and human resources. She was even chief of staff, a post that involved coordinating many Xerox functions.</p>
        <p>''Every time I was tempted to leave, they'd find something interesting,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mulcahy did not yes-sir her way to promotions. ''She's the first one to raise tough issues with the boss,'' said David A. Nadler, chairman of the Delta Consulting Group, which has worked with Xerox.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thoman recalled that Ms. Mulcahy persuaded him to abandon a product that had been in development for 18 months but in her opinion was wrong for the market. ''She has a keen marketing mind and the courage to speak out,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mulcahy says that when insecurity prompted her to hold her tongue -- at executive committee meetings, say, where esoteric technologies or unfamiliar markets were under discussion -- Mr. Allaire would prompt her to speak up. ''It was like I was back at the dinner table at home, being told you don't eat if you don't contribute,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The general markets organization was conceived at one of those meetings. Ms. Mulcahy persuaded the committee to put product development into the new group's bailiwick, and then she convinced Mr. Allaire and Mr. Thoman that she was the best person to run it.</p>
        <p>''It took them six months to decide, but finally they said yes, I could manage it all,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Maybe so, but at that time they were not thinking of the whole company.</p>
        <p>''Anne has tremendous talent and a logical mind,'' her brother Thomas said. ''But now she has to demonstrate that she has the operational skills to run something really big.''</p>
