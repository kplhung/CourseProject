        <p>Exploring a possible settlement of a potentially vast class action lawsuit, Sotheby's and Christie's have turned over confidential company information to lawyers representing customers who have accused them of price-fixing in the wake of a federal antitrust investigation.</p>
        <p>The information was disclosed yesterday during a hearing in Federal District Court in Manhattan at which the chief federal antitrust prosecutor in New York sought to keep confidential, at least through Aug. 12, documents described as central to the grand jury investigation.</p>
        <p>References in court suggested that they involved information from a former chief executive officer of Christie's, Christopher M. Davidge, that was turned over to the government by the auction house late last year in exchange for leniency. Plaintiffs in the civil case and also lawyers for Sotheby's have sought access to the documents as part of the pretrial discovery process. But the government prosecutor, John J. Greene, told Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who is presiding over the civil case, ''We feel disclosure of these documents will compromise the integrity of the grand jury.''</p>
        <p>Judge Kaplan said he would review the documents and decide whether they should be withheld.</p>
        <p>Disclosure of the talks -- which is common in such cases -- came as Judge Kaplan continued to grapple with the question of which lawyers should be given the lucrative designation of lead counsel in charge of the plaintiff's case. An interim panel of six appointed lawyers has been running the case so far.</p>
        <p>On April 20 the judge announced a novel approach: asking the dozens of lawyers already involved to bid for the case with offers of what they thought they might recover for their clients and what fees they would exact. Their deadline was midnight yesterday and 15 lawyers said they planned to compete.</p>
        <p>But some of the bidders complained in court that the initial six lead lawyers had an advantage because they were in the preliminary settlement talks and had received  confidential financial information and other data from the two houses.</p>
        <p>Judge Kaplan said he would review an analysis of the auction house information with an eye to possibly making it available to the other lawyers as well.</p>
        <p>The hearing drew 60 lawyers who filled almost every seat in the courtroom in the Pearl Street courthouse. ''Are the Knicks playing here this afternoon?'' the judge asked.</p>
