        <p>George W. Bush announced today that he would spend $1 million a year as governor of Texas to provide free trigger locks for handgun owners in the state and would push for a similar national initiative, at a cost of $65 million a year, if he was elected president.</p>

        <p>George W. Bush announced today that he would spend $1 million a year as governor of Texas to provide free trigger locks for handgun owners in the state and would push for a similar national initiative, at a cost of $65 million a year, if he was elected president.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Bush had not previously demonstrated much enthusiasm for a government role in promoting trigger locks and had stressed that they were not a panacea for gun violence, he presented his new approach as a way ''to be common-sensical about how we deal with gun safety.''</p>
        <p>He also conceded that his announcement was being made with an eye toward the Million Mom March in Washington, where women from around the country gather this weekend to call for stricter gun control.</p>
        <p>''Like them, I'm concerned about gun violence in our society,'' Mr. Bush said this morning in an appearance on the NBC News television program ''Today.'' The appearance was sought and arranged by his aides with the knowledge that President Clinton would be talking about gun control today on ''Good Morning America,'' on ABC.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Clinton announced today that the Justice Department would award grants of $300,000 each to two gun makers -- Smith &amp; Wesson and F. N. Manufacturing -- to help them develop ''smart guns'' that only the weapons' owners would be able to fire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton made his announcement in Ohio, where he told a group of women in North Canton that gun control proponents would prevail because ''the evidence is on their side, the human element is on their side.''</p>
        <p>''All they're trying to do,'' he said, ''is to protect our society from criminal acts and from avoidable accidents.''</p>
        <p>The president used his appearance on ''Good Morning America'' to express skepticism about Mr. Bush's announcement, and reiterated assertions by himself and Vice President Al Gore that the governor is a longtime friend of the National Rifle Association who is merely engaging in  a political makeover.</p>
        <p>''You have to understand what's going on here,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''There was a report in the newspaper last week that a lobbyist from the N.R.A. said they would have an office in the White House if Governor Bush was elected.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton was referring to a snippet of videotape, released as a television commercial by the advocacy group Handgun Control, in which Kayne Robinson, the N.R.A.'s first vice president and also Iowa Republican chairman, made that boast in a closed meeting with other members of the association in February. Mr. Bush has dismissed Mr. Robinson's remark as untrue, and did so again today.</p>
        <p>The dueling comments by Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton were among the many competing messages today as the Million Mom March approached. Television news programs were crowded with appeals from advocates on both sides of the issue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's announcement about trigger locks marked the latest step in a striking evolution of his position on them. It also suggested an awareness of gun control's potential as a potent issue in the 2000 elections and a concern with Mr. Gore's ability to portray the governor as an opponent of sensible restrictions on firearms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and his aides consistently draw attention to certain aspects of Mr. Bush's record on guns, most notably a 1995 law permitting Texans with proper training and licenses to carry concealed handguns. Mr. Bush also signed into law last year a measure making it extremely difficult for Texas cities and counties to sue gun manufacturers, and he has indicated support for similar legislation on the federal level.</p>
        <p>As for weapons and child safety, Mr. Bush did support a 1995 Texas law that held parents criminally liable if their firearms ended up in the hands of children and caused injury as a result. But as recently as last year, he said he opposed the mandatory sale of trigger locks or other child safety devices with handguns and supported voluntary measures instead.</p>
        <p>In early March, however, he said that if he became president and a mandatory measure reached his desk, he would sign it, although even then he emphasized the difficulty of getting people to adhere to it. ''Are we going to have trigger-lock police knocking on people's door?'' he  asked during a Republican presidential debate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides said today that his plan to distribute free trigger locks was consistent with his belief that it would be most effective and plausible to encourage voluntary use of them. The Texas program, in which gun owners will be able to obtain the locks at local police and fire stations, is to be financed by $5 million over five years in discretionary spending by the governor.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Bush proposed that the federal government make $325 million in matching funds available over five years for state and local governments that adopt similar programs.</p>
        <p>Gun control advocates said the governor's announcement reflected a sudden change in the level of attention he paid to child safety devices. ''It couldn't be a more crass political move,'' said Joe Sudbay, political director of Handgun Control.</p>
        <p>Although the drumbeat for enhanced gun control has grown louder and Mr. Gore supports a wider array of new measures than Mr. Bush, it is unclear who holds the political advantage. Several public opinion polls in recent months suggested that more Americans trusted Mr. Bush to handle the issue correctly than trusted Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>But a new ABC News poll, conducted just after the N.R.A. official's comments about a Bush White House became public last week, showed Mr. Gore with an edge, 46 percent to 38 percent. That telephone survey, of 1,068 adults interviewed from Sunday though Wednesday, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
