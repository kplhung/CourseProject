        <p>The University of Rochester had ambitions to be a national powerhouse in medical research. And it had charted a meticulous 10-year plan to get there: get more research money from the National Institutes of Health, recruit 100 more biomedical scientists and construct two research buildings.</p>
        <p>Then came the jackpot.</p>
        <p>In April, the university announced that it had been awarded a broad patent covering the use of a new type of painkiller that could bring in billions of dollars in royalties.</p>
        <p>So administrators, faculty and students at the midsize university are mulling over how the institution could be catapulted to prominence faster than anyone had dreamed.</p>
        <p>''If it happens, it would certainly be a great catalyst,'' Dr. Jay Stein, who oversees the University of Rochester Medical Center, said of the potential billions. ''It could obviously make it easier to do what we're planning and help us compete better with the Harvards, Stanfords and so on.''</p>
        <p>A no-nonsense scientist to the end, Dr. Stein soberly refused to bite when asked for his wildest fantasies on how the money might be spent. So did other administrators.</p>
        <p>Yet it could be a lot of money. Officials at the university say the patent, for the basic science underlying a new type of painkiller, is the most lucrative ever awarded to an academic institution.</p>
        <p>The patent says that research conducted in the late 1980's and early 1990's by Dr. Donald Young, a professor of medicine and biochemistry at the university, and two colleagues pioneered the development of Cox-2 inhibitor drugs. The popular medications are sometimes called superaspirin for their ability to alleviate pain while minimizing side effects -- particularly stomach ulcers -- associated with frequent use of aspirin, ibuprofen or similar painkillers. Superaspirin has become the pharmaceutical industry's fastest-selling product, and analysts predict that the market for such drugs could grow to $12 billion per year by 2008, said Terry O'Grady, associate counsel for the University of Rochester Medical School.</p>
        <p>Officials at the university caution that no one should expect to see Porsches filling the parking lot any time soon, primarily because of legal fights with the companies that developed products that the university said were based on its research. After the university received the patent, it immediately filed a patent infringement suit against the makers of one top-selling painkiller, Celebrex, claiming that the university is entitled to significant royalties. Legal showdowns with makers of several best-selling drugs could tie up the case for years.</p>
        <p>But that hasn't kept some people from dreaming.</p>
        <p>Plenty of students and faculty on the university campus of staid red-brick buildings have ideas on how to put the money to good use.</p>
        <p>The most commonly heard pitch from students? Start by trimming the $31,000 price tag for tuition and lodging. One English professor asked to have elevators installed in the five-story building where she works. (Her office happens to be on the fifth floor.)</p>
        <p>For now, they can all dream on. ''If this patent proves to be as incredibly lucrative as we believe it will be, we will be doing more of the same,'' said Thomas H. Jackson, the university's president. Mr. Jackson said a significant portion of the money would be used for basic research, labs and the hiring of faculty members, though no specifics had been worked out.</p>
        <p>Experts say a growing number of universities are showing an increased willingness to seek their share of riches from inventions.</p>
        <p>''Universities have gotten a lot smarter about how to encourage faculty to engage in this kind of activity and a lot smarter about how to win the patent battle,'' said Robert Zemsky, a professor and director of the Institute for Research on Higher Education at the University of Pennsylvania. ''This is a giant deal. If this works, this is the university equivalent of the big-game lottery.''</p>
        <p>The University of Rochester filed the patent application in 1992, and it took eight years to work its way through the United States Patent and Trademark Office. This turned out to be to Rochester's benefit because in the meantime, the drugs have gone on the market and became an immediate hit. Because the life of the patent -- 17 years -- began when it was granted, the university presumably avoided wasting many years as a patent holder before the drugs began to make money.</p>
        <p>When the university decided to undertake the expensive process of filing a patent application, it was intended to protect intellectual property. ''This was truly an academic patent,'' said Mr. Jackson. ''I don't think anybody necessarily thought that it would be a huge commercial success. As it sat in the patent office, it went from looking more and more like the original decision was not only correct but stunningly correct.''</p>
        <p>Nils Hasselmo, president of the Association of American Universities, said such patents had become an important part of university financing.</p>
        <p>''Universities in recent years have tried to get patents and licensing opportunities in order to generate revenues for both research and education,'' he said. ''There's one study that calls it academic capitalism.''</p>
        <p>The University of Rochester is regarded as more of a solid regional institution rather than a heavy-hitting national player, though a number of its programs, like optics and the Eastman School of Music, are well respected.</p>
        <p>The university, with about 6,500 students, was ranked 32nd last year among 228 national universities by U.S. News &amp; World Report. Several of the university's graduate programs, including political science and economics, were ranked in the top fifth nationwide in a 1995 study by the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
        <p>On a recent spring day, in which the main preoccupations were final exams and soaking up the sunny weather on the grassy university quadrangle, many students said they did not really expect the patent to change their lives any time soon.</p>
        <p>Rebecca Green was taken aback to learn that drug profits could be so huge. ''I wish it resulted in a tuition decrease and financial aid, but I don't think it will,'' said Ms. Green, 22, who was studying for a psychology exam.</p>
        <p>Sarah Apgar, 22, a microbiology major, was in her dormitory room, recuperating from final exams. She said she hoped that the university would at least win name recognition if the patent came to fruition.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people in the general population get it confused with SUNY schools or the Rochester Institute of Technology,'' said Ms. Apgar, a senior who plans to attend the university's medical school. ''People don't know what it is exactly. They don't know it's a private institution.''</p>
        <p>Medical research is expected to be the big winner from any royalties. Even before the announcement of the patent award, the University of Rochester Medical Center was 3 years into a 10-year, $550 million self-improvement regimen. It has hired nearly half of the 100 research scientists that it plans to recruit, has built one research building and is to break ground in June on a second one.</p>
        <p>A year and a half ago, Dr. Bradford Berk was recruited from the University of Washington in Seattle. He had graduated from the University of Rochester and returned to direct its new center for cardiovascular research at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences. The federal government pays for a special program to train two to six medical science students at Rochester each year. Dr. Berk would like to see more.</p>
        <p>''They are the future scientists,'' said Dr. Berk, standing amid the airy and spacious new laboratories that he oversees. ''The only way to get new Don Youngs is to train the young people.''</p>
        <p>Even Rochester's mayor cannot keep the sugarplums from dancing in his head. The mayor, William A. Johnson, imagines the university turbocharging a local economy that has seen a steady decline in manufacturing jobs. He envisions new discoveries at the university spinning off local companies, which in turn would lead to scores of skilled jobs in the community.</p>
        <p>It is not fanciful thinking. The university's most lucrative patent to date, for an influenza vaccine used globally, yielded $34 million in royalties and led to the creation of a locally based company that has already produced 165 highly skilled jobs.</p>
        <p>Richard Insel, a pediatric immunologist at the University of Rochester, was one of the founders of the start-up company that developed the influenza vaccine. He said he hoped that the potential income from the latest patent would promote an environment in which researchers will take risks. Dr. Insel said he would like the revenue to attract creative people who would not be expected to generate purely money-making ideas but ideas for ideas' sake.  ''Some of the efforts here would be just asking questions and not necessarily developing products,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The wish list was modest in Dr. Young's spartan laboratory in an old section of the medical school. Dr. Young, who was assisted by Michael K. O'Banion and Virginia D. Winn in paving the way for the development of Cox-2 inhibitor drugs, declined to comment, primarily because of litigation, a university spokesman said. But the researchers are likely to become millionaires many times over if the patent prevails.</p>
        <p>In the 1920's-era fluorescent-lit laboratory, a technician, Thomas Murant, said he would buy new centrifuges and incubators to replace malfunctioning equipment that has been borrowed from other laboratories. ''In research, you always have to look to see how much money you are spending,'' said Mr. Murant, 37, who has not taken off a weekend in two months. ''It's a very big concern. When a lab closes, you go and scavenge.''</p>
        <p>The technician expressed pride in the university's good fortune. But by nature, scientists are cautious types. So Mr. Murant is taking the wait-and-see approach: ''You just carry on and keep doing your work.''</p>
