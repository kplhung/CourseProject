      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In Bishop Edward M. Egan, Pope John Paul II appears to have found a dependable successor to Cardinal John O'Connor as leader of the country's most visible Roman Catholic archdiocese. Bishop Egan is well known to the pope after years of work at the Vatican, and is a theological conservative who can be expected to reinforce the pope's -- and Cardinal O'Connor's -- stern views on abortion, contraception and homosexuality. But given the financial and managerial challenges facing the diocese, Bishop Egan's demonstrated administrative skills may have appealed to the pope every bit as much as his doctrinal reliability.</p>
        <p>The landscape of the archdiocese Bishop Egan inherits -- embracing 2.4 million Catholics in Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and seven counties north of the city -- changed dramatically during Cardinal O'Connor's 16-year tenure. New languages and cultures mushroomed, and some older parishes declined while those in the suburbs swelled with newcomers. Financially, some parishes boomed while others languished. Although Cardinal O'Connor struggled to avoid shutting Catholic schools despite dwindling enrollments, his successor may have no choice but to consolidate some schools and parishes and close others.</p>

        <p>In Bishop Edward M. Egan, Pope John Paul II appears to have found a dependable successor to Cardinal John O'Connor as leader of the country's most visible Roman Catholic archdiocese. Bishop Egan is well known to the pope after years of work at the Vatican, and is a theological conservative who can be expected to reinforce the pope's -- and Cardinal O'Connor's -- stern views on abortion, contraception and homosexuality. But given the financial and managerial challenges facing the diocese, Bishop Egan's demonstrated administrative skills may have appealed to the pope every bit as much as his doctrinal reliability.</p>
        <p>The landscape of the archdiocese Bishop Egan inherits -- embracing 2.4 million Catholics in Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and seven counties north of the city -- changed dramatically during Cardinal O'Connor's 16-year tenure. New languages and cultures mushroomed, and some older parishes declined while those in the suburbs swelled with newcomers. Financially, some parishes boomed while others languished. Although Cardinal O'Connor struggled to avoid shutting Catholic schools despite dwindling enrollments, his successor may have no choice but to consolidate some schools and parishes and close others.</p>
        <p>In 1988 Bishop Egan faced the same situation on a smaller scale when he became Archbishop of Bridgeport, Conn., an archdiocese that includes poor areas as well as upscale Fairfield County. By all accounts he did a superb job of putting the archdiocese on a sound financial footing, though it entailed unpopular decisions. He was also a first-class recruiter, bringing a steady stream of young men into the priesthood despite the absence of a major seminary in the area to train them. This skill could also come in handy in his new territory. Over the last year more than 30 priests have died in the New York Archdiocese, but only 6 new priests have been ordained to replace them.</p>
        <p>Some church observers regard Bishop Egan, who is 68 and must under church law tender his resignation at the age of 75, as an interim archbishop who will hold things together while the Vatican grooms a Hispanic leader to replace him. With one exception, archbishops of New York have always been Irish, but Hispanics, who make up more than a third of the archdiocese, now outnumber the Irish. Still, Bishop Egan is not expected to be a mere caretaker. There are many important challenges ahead, and judging by his record, he is prepared to tackle them.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 17, 2000, Wednesday  An editorial in Saturday's Times misidentified Bishop Edward M. Egan as having been archbishop of the archdiocese of Bridgeport. He was bishop of the diocese of Bridgeport.</p>
