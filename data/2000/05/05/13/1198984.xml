        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>INDONESIA: ACEH TRUCE -- The government and representatives of separatist rebels from Aceh Province signed an agreement described as a ''humanitarian pause,'' resulting in the first cease-fire in more than two decades. While both sides welcomed the truce, signed at an undisclosed location in Geneva, as a milestone, both sides were quick to qualify it. The rebels pledged to continue pushing for independence, and Jakarta ruled out recognizing the insurgents. The cease-fire will begin June 2.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: SUHARTO PROTEST -- The police fired tear gas at hundreds of student protesters who gathered outside former President Suharto's home demanding that he be put on trial for corruption. The students responded by throwing rocks and gasoline bombs. Mr. Suharto, 79, has been charged with corruption but not yet put on trial. He has lately refused to be questioned by prosecutors, saying he is too ill.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: TIGERS ADVANCE -- Tamil Tiger rebels warned civilians to flee Jaffna as they advanced to the edge of their former capital and the government retreated. Sustained bombing was seen as delaying the rebels' final move into the city, which the government won control of five years ago, but aid agencies said civilians were seen moving out with their belongings when a curfew there was briefly lifted.</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: CONCESSIONS SOUGHT -- David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, said he would press Britain for concessions on keeping the Royal Ulster Constabulary name for the province's new police service and on flying the Union Jack from government buildings before deciding whether to recommend at a meeting next Saturday that the Protestant party go back into government with Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army.</p>
        <p>Warren Hoge (NYT)</p>
        <p>IRELAND: ROMANIANS TO BE DEPORTED -- Justice Minister John O'Donoghue announced that Ireland would begin deporting illegal Romanian immigrants under a treaty concluded between the two countries. Romania will station two police officers in Ireland to further the process. The government estimates that 95 percent of the 5,500 Romanian immigrants in Ireland have no claim to political asylum.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: CASH MACHINES RUN DRY -- Cash machines began running out of money as a strike by armored car guards entered its fourth day, and shops complained they were running out of change. The guards struck after a series of attacks left one guard dead. They want danger pay and limits on how far they can walk from their vehicles.</p>
        <p>Donald G. McNeil Jr. (NYT)</p>
        <p>KOSOVO: SERB TRIALS TO START -- The United Nations administration said war-crimes trials would start next month for Serbs who have gone on a hunger strike to protest being held for up to 10 months without trial. The protest in Mitrovica by about 30 Serbs and 5 Gypsies, who have refused food since May 1, has highlighted the United Nations' difficulties in setting up a functioning justice system in Kosovo.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>CANADA: INDIANS WIN CLAIM -- Members of the Nisga'a Indian Nation celebrated the formal enactment of a treaty giving the 5,500-member tribe self-government rights over 745 square miles and $328 million in federal aid. It is the first modern land-claims treaty in British Columbia, where about 40 tribes are negotiating with the provincial government.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>ISRAEL, JORDAN: AIRPORT ACCORD -- The two countries signed an agreement to proceed with a long-delayed plan for a shared airport straddling the border between the Red Sea ports of Eilat and Aqaba, Israel announced. Environmentalists have vowed to fight the project, and some Jordanian officials still question Israel's commitment to the plan.</p>
        <p>William A. Orme Jr. (NYT)</p>
        <p>IRAN: TOLERANCE PLEA -- The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called on hard-line and reformist factions to move closer together and increase their tolerance. ''Some may favor one group and some another,'' he said. ''But they all believe in Islam.'' His speech came after reformists won more than 70 percent of seats in runoff parliamentary elections.</p>
        <p>Nazila Fathi (NYT)</p>
        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>SOUTH AFRICA: BOESAK CONVICTION STANDS -- The Supreme Court of Appeal upheld the conviction of a leading antiapartheid cleric, Allan Boesak, and sentenced him to three years in prison. This halved a sentence given last year to Mr. Boesak, 53, former head of the Geneva-based World Council of Reformed Churches, for theft and fraud involving $183,500 of foreign donor money channeled into an aid agency he ran for apartheid victims. But a five-judge panel upheld his conviction on similar charges involving $37,000 from a $96,000 donation by the pop singer Paul Simon.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>ZIMBABWE: LAND TRANSFER PLAN -- President Robert Mugabe denounced the violence on hundreds of white-owned farms, leaving at least 19 dead since February, and announced a process for the transfer of white-owned farmland to landless blacks. But he said the black war veterans leading the farm invasions would not leave until a start had been made on redistributing land. A committee will be set up soon to manage the redistribution, he said.</p>
