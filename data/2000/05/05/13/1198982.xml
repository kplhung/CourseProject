        <p>In her modest, ingratiating romantic comedy, ''Achilles' Love,'' Meredith Cole has framed a valentine to the warm ties of Pittsburgh's Greek-Americans and to the bumpy road of love.</p>
        <p>No Cary Grant-Grace Kelly romance on the Riviera is to be found here, only locations like Three Rivers Stadium, the musical spirit of ''Zorba the Greek'' and the tale of a couple of middle-class people impelled by their innate decency, supported by their friends in times of trouble and rewarded at last by a happily-ever-after ending.</p>
        <p>Though it drags slightly at times and a villain and a kleptomaniac who figure largely in the plot are overdrawn and not always logical, ''Achilles' Love'' has two appealing leads in Mather Zickel and Claudia Besso; a charm-filled Greek chorus to prod the young lovers and save the day; and a general air of affection.</p>
        <p>The film also casts a knowing, satirical eye on the cynical dating habits of moneyed bachelors and on the courting rituals of arts troupes and their wealthy patrons.</p>
        <p>Played out over 10 tumultuous days, mostly introduced by the quotations from ancient Greeks like Sophocles and Plato, this film, written by John C. Mouganis and Heidi Haaland, tells the story of Achilles Mannis (played by Mr. Zickel) and Lucy Boxwell (Ms. Besso).</p>
        <p>They meet. They warily fall in love. They mistakenly believe each other to be unfaithful, and when Lucy's Steel City Dance company disintegrates on the eve of a big competition for grants, Achilles and his father's affectionate old cronies dance to the rescue by performing a traditional syrtaki.</p>
        <p>It doesn't hurt that Constantine Zoras (Alex Coleman), a wealthy Greek shipowner who knew Achilles's father when they were beginning their careers, is around at the finish to help Achilles and Lucy restart their lives after he has lost his job as an insurance agent and her dance company has dissolved.</p>
        <p>At the outset of these adventures, Achilles, known as Ike, is almost 30, and his late father's contemporaries think it's time he married. ''Alone is wrong,'' one of them says.</p>
        <p>Achilles may be unmarried but he is not alone, at least not until a videotape, played in the coffeehouse where everyone hangs out, reveals to all that he has been dumped by his girlfriend.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Lucy is finding out that Pascal (Andre Koslowski), the egotistic star dancer of her troupe, has been cheating on her, and when he tries to apologize by ostentatiously performing below her window one night, he sets the stage for Ike and Lucy to discover that they are neighbors.</p>
        <p>To complicate matters, Ike is being double-crossed at work by his boss; he is saddled with a kleptomaniac as a new associate, and his buddy Connan Charles (Mr. Mouganis), a wealthy, cynical, devious negligence lawyer, is about to meet Lucy and decide that he can win his way to her heart with a check to support Steel City Dance.</p>
        <p>''Achilles' Love'' proves that money can't buy everything, though it comes in handy.</p>
