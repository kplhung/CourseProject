        <p>David Evans letter warns that government's plan to break up Microsoft would create mare's nest of rules</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Richard Gilbert (Op-Ed, May 10) contrasts the government regulation of the heirs to AT&amp;T's businesses with the prospect of a clean division of Microsoft into two virtually unregulated companies.</p>
        <p>In fact, the government's plan would create a mare's nest of rules -- everything from a requirement that the new Microsoft operating system company continue to sell obsolete versions of Windows at a fixed price, to a remarkable provision obliging the new company to discount ''light'' versions of Windows in proportion to the amount of code the computer maker chooses to rip out. Meanwhile, government functionaries would be called upon to decide imponderables like whether additions to Windows were ''middle-ware'' and thus must come with an easy means of removal.</p>

        <p>Richard Gilbert (Op-Ed, May 10) contrasts the government regulation of the heirs to AT&amp;T's businesses with the prospect of a clean division of Microsoft into two virtually unregulated companies.</p>
        <p>In fact, the government's plan would create a mare's nest of rules -- everything from a requirement that the new Microsoft operating system company continue to sell obsolete versions of Windows at a fixed price, to a remarkable provision obliging the new company to discount ''light'' versions of Windows in proportion to the amount of code the computer maker chooses to rip out. Meanwhile, government functionaries would be called upon to decide imponderables like whether additions to Windows were ''middle-ware'' and thus must come with an easy means of removal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gilbert also asserts that the breakup would accelerate innovation in software. Yet the involuntary division of a productive company that is organized around flexible project lines is bound to slow technological change within the two Microsofts for many years.</p>
