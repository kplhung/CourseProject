        <p>British scientists report that microwave radiation can indirectly damage roundworms. Their data, the investigators say, bear on the question of whether cellular telephones are safe.</p>
        <p>But several American scientists questioned whether the worm experiments had anything to do with cell phone safety.</p>
        <p>The study, by David de Pomerai of the University of Nottingham and his colleagues, will appear in the May 25 issue of Nature, a British science journal. The journal's editors decided to release it yesterday because they thought that it might be important in discussions of a report by a committee of scientists convened by the British government to assess the safety of cellular telephones.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, that committee reported that while there was no direct evidence of danger from the popular devices, there were some worrisome findings, like the study with worms. To be on the safe side, they said, children under age 16 should limit their use of cellular telephones.</p>
        <p>The problem with positing dangers from the phones, scientists say, is that the microwave radiation emitted by them is too weak to break bonds in molecules. It has been hard to figure out how the microwaves would produce damage other than by heating tissue, which does not seem to occur. While microwave ovens can heat tissue, the power from the phones is too low to produce heating.</p>
        <p>In their new report in Nature, the scientists say that the worms exposed to microwaves produce a type of protein, called heat shock proteins, that they and other species, including humans, make in response to injuries, like heat or certain toxins. But, they say, the microwave radiation did not heat the worms.</p>
        <p>As evidence that there was no heating, the investigators measured the temperature in the petri dishes where the minuscule worms floated in liquid. Since temperature probes are larger than these worms, it can be hard to know what the actual temperatures of the worms are as they bounce around in the dishes.</p>
        <p>But, the researchers wrote, they compared the heat shock proteins made by unexposed worms that served as controls, with those made by worms that were bombarded with microwaves.</p>
        <p>The investigators kept the fluid in the petri dishes at various temperatures and noted when the worms made heat shock proteins. At a certain temperature, all the worms make the proteins. But those exposed to microwaves made them when the fluid was slightly cooler by about three degrees centigrade than those that were not exposed to microwaves, they reported.</p>
        <p>Some scientists questioned how the results could be translated to infer possible risks to human health.</p>
        <p>''Frankly I can't see what this has to do with children using cell phones,'' said Dr. Eleanor Adair, who is a senior scientist at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, studying electromagnetic radiation effects.</p>
        <p>''It's terribly difficult to make accurate measurements of temperatures in petri dishes because the temperature varies all over the place,'' Dr. Adair said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Charles Stevens, a neurologist at the Salk Institute in San Diego, and a consultant to Motorola, said there had been many dozens of studies that failed to show health effects of microwave radiation like that emitted by cell phones, and he knew of no studies that had been replicated that showed effects.</p>
