        <p>Re ''Giuliani and His Wife of 16 Years Are Separating'' (front page, May 11): If Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's wife, Donna Hanover, truly cares for him, she should realize how important it is for a cancer patient to have as little stress in his life as possible. No matter how hurt she may be, that can be dealt with later. Winning a battle with cancer requires as much peace as possible. That's a tall order for any politician, let alone a mayor of New York City who is also running a Senate campaign.</p>
