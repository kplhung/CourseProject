        <p>Editorial on 'controlled' forest fire that is now burning out of control in New Mexico</p>

        <p>As almost everyone in the country knows by now, there is nothing exact about the science of ''controlled'' or ''prescribed'' burning of forests. It is a time-honored technique for clearing forests of debris and thus preventing even more devastating fires that can incinerate entire landscapes. But there is a thin line between success and failure, and what began as a controlled burn in New Mexico's Bandelier National Monument wound up on the wrong side of that line. Fed by winds gusting higher than 60 miles an hour, the fire jumped its intended boundaries, destroying about 270 homes and forcing the evacuation of 18,000 people in nearby Los Alamos. It also immobilized the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where the nation's nuclear weapons are designed.</p>
        <p>On Thursday the National Park Service's regional director suspended Roy Weaver, the Bandelier superintendent, who originally ordered the burn, pending an inquiry. Yesterday Bruce Babbitt, the interior secretary, ordered a 30-day moratorium on controlled burns in the West while the investigation proceeds. Mr. Babbitt said it was not yet clear whether the blaze had resulted from human error, faulty technical guidelines -- meaning the government's own rules about how to carry out a prescribed burn -- or an unforeseeable act of nature.</p>

        <p>As almost everyone in the country knows by now, there is nothing exact about the science of ''controlled'' or ''prescribed'' burning of forests. It is a time-honored technique for clearing forests of debris and thus preventing even more devastating fires that can incinerate entire landscapes. But there is a thin line between success and failure, and what began as a controlled burn in New Mexico's Bandelier National Monument wound up on the wrong side of that line. Fed by winds gusting higher than 60 miles an hour, the fire jumped its intended boundaries, destroying about 270 homes and forcing the evacuation of 18,000 people in nearby Los Alamos. It also immobilized the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where the nation's nuclear weapons are designed.</p>
        <p>On Thursday the National Park Service's regional director suspended Roy Weaver, the Bandelier superintendent, who originally ordered the burn, pending an inquiry. Yesterday Bruce Babbitt, the interior secretary, ordered a 30-day moratorium on controlled burns in the West while the investigation proceeds. Mr. Babbitt said it was not yet clear whether the blaze had resulted from human error, faulty technical guidelines -- meaning the government's own rules about how to carry out a prescribed burn -- or an unforeseeable act of nature.</p>
        <p>What is clear is that nobody should be stampeded into abandoning a policy of controlled burning that, on the whole, has been remarkably successful. The fires are an essential means of heading off devastating accidental fires in forests that have been allowed to grow too dense because for years the government followed a misguided policy of suppressing natural fires. In the last 20 years the Park Service has set 3,783 fires, with only 38 ''escapes'' -- fires that jumped their pre-designed limits. On average, about 2.5 million acres are targeted for controlled burns every year.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the conditions that encourage a successful controlled burn are not markedly different from those that can cause disaster. A successful controlled burn requires a certain amount of wind and a certain amount of dryness. Too much of both can cause serious problems. The government's task now will be to use whatever lessons can be gleaned from the Los Alamos disaster to make an essentially sound strategy even safer.</p>
