        <p>Setting its sights on affluent North America, Terra Networks S.A., the aggressive Internet company controlled by the Spanish phone giant, Telefonica S.A., told stock market regulators in Madrid today that it was in talks with the Web search company, Lycos Inc.</p>
        <p>Officials of Terra and Lycos would not comment further, but Spanish newspapers have reported recently that the companies were in talks to merge part or all of their activities.</p>
        <p>Analysts say such a combination would make sense, giving Lycos access to Spanish-language Web content. It would also give Terra, which is strong in Latin America, an inroad into the big Spanish-language population of the United States, estimated by Spanish media executives to be as large as 35 million people, with an average per capita income two to three times that of Latin Americans.</p>
        <p>Terra, a darling of investors in European Internet companies, reported today that it had about two million subscribers, six times the number a year ago, with roughly half of them in Spain, and the large part of the remainder in Latin America.</p>
        <p>But Spanish media groups and Internet companies are hungrily looking at the United States.</p>
        <p>Terra reported revenue of $33.5 million in the quarter ended Jan. 31, about half that of Lycos in the equivalent period. But Terra's market value, at $16.2 billion, is roughly three times that of Lycos.</p>
