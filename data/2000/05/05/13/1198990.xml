      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A knack for conjuring fun in a laughter-free vacuum may be the ultimate test of a comic performer. And in ''Screwed,'' a confusedly misconceived hybrid of interracial buddy comedy and imitation Marx Brothers farce, Danny DeVito is the only cast member who succeeds in making something out of the movie's nothing of a screenplay. As Grover Cleaver, a bushy-haired undertaker who gets drawn into a kidnapping scheme, Mr. DeVito huffs and mugs and waddles through his role like a happy mad scientist whose maniacally gleaming eyes suggest he could be imagining a chorus line of lab rats doing a striptease.</p>
        <p>When we first encounter Grover, he is hard at work in a morgue, having just extracted a pet rock from a dead body. Grover proudly displays an exhibit of other items he has removed from corpses, including a television clicker and ''a perfectly  good comb.'' As a sideline, this character, who is addicted to reruns of ''Hawaii Five-O,'' during which he proudly recites every line of dialogue a second ahead of time, is vice president of the Jack Lord fan club.</p>

        <p>A knack for conjuring fun in a laughter-free vacuum may be the ultimate test of a comic performer. And in ''Screwed,'' a confusedly misconceived hybrid of interracial buddy comedy and imitation Marx Brothers farce, Danny DeVito is the only cast member who succeeds in making something out of the movie's nothing of a screenplay. As Grover Cleaver, a bushy-haired undertaker who gets drawn into a kidnapping scheme, Mr. DeVito huffs and mugs and waddles through his role like a happy mad scientist whose maniacally gleaming eyes suggest he could be imagining a chorus line of lab rats doing a striptease.</p>
        <p>When we first encounter Grover, he is hard at work in a morgue, having just extracted a pet rock from a dead body. Grover proudly displays an exhibit of other items he has removed from corpses, including a television clicker and ''a perfectly  good comb.'' As a sideline, this character, who is addicted to reruns of ''Hawaii Five-O,'' during which he proudly recites every line of dialogue a second ahead of time, is vice president of the Jack Lord fan club.</p>
        <p>Just how and why Grover is lured into this kidnapping plot is too boring to go into. Suffice it to say, he is offered a large sum of money to find a matching corpse on which another character's identification will be planted. The body Grover selects to impersonate a much younger and healthier man happens to be that of an ancient white-bearded dwarf. In his every grunt, eyebrow twitch and stumbling step, Mr. DeVito conveys the frantic sense of the absurd that is missing from the rest of this hectic mess of film.</p>
        <p>Next to Mr. DeVito's Grover, the other performers seem hopelessly earthbound. Norm Macdonald (who  delivered the ''fake news'' on ''Saturday Night Live'') and Dave Chappelle, the comics who have to carry the movie, are much-too-cool cookies who have little buddy-buddy chemistry and no apparent knack for broad physical comedy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Macdonald's character, Willard Fillmore, is an oppressed servant of Virginia Crock (Elaine Stritch), a tyrannical baking tycoon and flinty tightwad whose monumental nastiness gives new dimensions to the term ''queen of mean.'' She has a vicious, contrary little dog named Muffin that only behaves nicely when commanded to attack.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chappelle is Willard's best friend, Rusty, the proprietor of a fast food emporium in Pittsburgh. Before the movie's over, their scheme to kidnap Muffin and ransom the yapping little monster for a million dollars takes a dozen zany hairpin turns.</p>
        <p>The film was written and directed by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, the team whose innovative screenplays include ''Ed Wood,'' ''The People vs. Larry Flynt'' and ''Man on the Moon.'' It's hard to believe that the weak screenplay for  this film, with its stale double-entendres and would-be hip remarks like, ''He talks like a black man named Chip,'' was written by the same two people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alexander and Mr. Karaszewski are working on a movie biography of the Marx Brothers. If this film is a dry run for that project, they clearly have their work cut out for them.</p>
        <p>''Screwed'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has rude jokes.</p>
        <p>SCREWED</p>
        <p>Written and directed by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski; director of photography, Robert Brinkmann; edited by Michael Jablow; music by Michel Colombier; production designer, Mark Freeborn; produced by Robert Simonds; released by Universal Pictures. Running time: 90 minutes. This film is rated PG-13.</p>
        <p>WITH: Norm Macdonald (Willard Fillmore), Dave Chappelle (Rusty), Elaine Stritch (Virginia Crock), Daniel Benzali (Det. Tom Dewey), Sherman Hemsley (Chip Oswald) and Danny DeVito (Grover).</p>
