        <p>Riley on 'Freedom'</p>
        <p>While much has been made of the coaching matchup between Pat Riley and his former assistant Jeff Van Gundy, Riley figures that the attention is well deserved. Asked if there was a tendency in these games to overanalyze and overcoach, and if he ever felt an urge to let the players go and create, he hesitated, almost startled by the suggestion.</p>

        <p>Riley on 'Freedom'</p>
        <p>While much has been made of the coaching matchup between Pat Riley and his former assistant Jeff Van Gundy, Riley figures that the attention is well deserved. Asked if there was a tendency in these games to overanalyze and overcoach, and if he ever felt an urge to let the players go and create, he hesitated, almost startled by the suggestion.</p>
        <p>''Uh, never,'' Riley said. ''It's called freedom, shackled freedom. No, there's a lot of freedom. I think both teams are running. That's why we were bad the other night. There was too much freedom, too much freedom of choice in making decisions in random situations instead of executing the offense.''</p>
        <p>Fans Like No Other</p>
        <p>The Heat surrendered the home-court advantage when the Knicks took Game 2 at American Airlines Arena on Tuesday, but the thought of moving to Madison Square Garden did not intimidate Pat Riley or his players.</p>
        <p>''I'm not really concerned about the mystique or whatever,'' Alonzo Mourning said. ''The only difference is that they're New York fans, typical New York fans. They're like no other on the face of this earth. I don't know of another arena that has these type of fans. They're very fickle, but they live and die by this team.''</p>
        <p>Riley added: ''I've been in a lot of buildings in 30 years and a lot of them have had an impact both ways. Not only have they been raucous, but we've had a chance to quiet a lot of arenas, too.''</p>
