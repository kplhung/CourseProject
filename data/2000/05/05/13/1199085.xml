        <p>He is arguably the Knicks' best clutch player, the powerful forward who becomes a 3-point marksman at the game's most critical moments.

        <p>He is arguably the Knicks' best clutch player, the powerful forward who becomes a 3-point marksman at the game's most critical moments. He put his signature on last year's fanciful playoff run with his unforgettable  4-point play that pushed the Knicks to victory over Indiana in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals, then made back-to-back 3-pointers in the fourth quarter of a victory in Game 5 on the Pacers' home floor.</p>
        <p>This postseason -- his botched 3-pointer in Game 1 against the Miami Heat notwithstanding -- Larry Johnson had showed signs that the late-game magic still emanated from his flicked wrist, making key 3-pointers in Games 1 and 3 of the Knicks' first-round sweep of Toronto.</p>
        <p>But that glorious resume was not enough to get Johnson off the bench for the final 11 minutes of the Knicks' heart-wrenching 77-76 loss to the Heat last night. With the tide of the game swinging from team to team, Johnson stayed in the odd position of a spectator.</p>
        <p>Coach Jeff Van Gundy, who was criticized for not playing a hot Marcus Camby for the final four minutes of the Knicks' loss to Miami in Game 1, was not asked to address the situation in his postgame interview, and a visibly down Johnson refused to talk about it.</p>
        <p>Instead of going with Johnson, who played 34 minutes and had only 5 points and 3 rebounds and shot 1 for 5, Van Gundy went with the other four starters and Camby during the overtime.</p>
        <p>Camby, though struggling offensively, was playing a fantastic defensive game, blocking a game-high six shots, including three after the start of the fourth quarter. He also secured the offensive rebound that made Patrick Ewing's game-tying jumper at the end of regulation possible.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the Knicks would have won were it not for Anthony Carter's running, strangely angled shot that bounced high off the rim before falling through for the game-winning points with 2.2 seconds left in overtime.</p>
        <p>Camby, who finished with 4 points and 5 rebounds while shooting 1 for 7 in 32 minutes, was pleased to play down the stretch, particularly after recording 4 points and 5 rebounds in the first eight minutes of Game 1 before being pulled.</p>
        <p>''It felt good to be playing,'' he said. ''I had a dismal first half and I just tried to make the best of the situation in the second half and tried to go out there and play hard. I tried to do things to get us going.''</p>
        <p>Camby, who played with a sore right elbow and a prizefighter's cut above his right eye, scored the overtime basket that sent the Madison Square Garden crowd into hysterics and seemed to be enough to seal the victory for the Knicks. With 2 minutes 13 seconds left, he converted an alley-oop dunk off a feed from Charlie Ward from the top of the key.</p>
        <p>The basket gave the Knicks a 75-71 lead, led Heat Coach Pat Riley to call a timeout and spurred the Garden disk jockey to throw on the boisterous rap song, ''Whoa,'' by Black Rob. The thunderous drum and bass that reverberated throughout the arena were fitting considering the power of Camby's dunk and blocks. Camby, however, was guarded in his celebration. He knew the game was not over.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't really ranting and jumping up and raving,'' said Camby, who said he was not bothered by his injuries. ''I got a little excited, but there was a lot of basketball left.''</p>
        <p>After blocking two shots in the first half, Camby came alive in Dikembe Mutombo-like fashion afterward, swatting four shots. Van Gundy called Camby from the bench with three minutes left in the third quarter after watching Miami's P. J. Brown score 6 consecutive points, including two jumpers over Johnson.</p>
        <p>On the first play after his re-entry, Camby blocked a shot by Clarence Weatherspoon. He then rejected three more shots in the first four minutes of the fourth quarter -- two offerings by Weatherspoon and one driving layup by Dan Majerle that Camby pasted emphatically as the shot clock expired.</p>
        <p>For all his shot-blocking, Camby was kept off the glass, registering only five rebounds after averaging 10 over the first two games of the series. That lack of production was critical, as the Knicks were severely outrebounded, 45-34.</p>
        <p>''There were like two or three guys on me,'' Camby said. ''They were definitely making it tough. Every time the ball is shot, guys were face guarding me. If we had somebody else going to the glass, I'm sure we could get some.''</p>
