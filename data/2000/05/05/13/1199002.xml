        <p>SBC Communications Inc., the nation's No. 1 local telephone carrier, took a small step toward entering the long-distance market yesterday when the Justice Department said the company had alleviated one of the department's concerns about opening its networks to competitors.</p>
        <p>SBC is seeking approval from the Federal Communications Commission to offer long-distance services in Texas. To do that, the company must convince the F.C.C. that it has opened its local systems to potential competitors. So far, Bell Atlantic is the only Bell phone company to have won long-distance approval, for New York State.</p>

        <p>SBC is seeking approval from the Federal Communications Commission to offer long-distance services in Texas. To do that, the company must convince the F.C.C. that it has opened its local systems to potential competitors. So far, Bell Atlantic is the only Bell phone company to have won long-distance approval, for New York State.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department advises the commission on long-distance applications, but the department's recommendations are not binding.</p>
        <p>Responding to an earlier version of SBC's long-distance petition, the department had identified at least four technical problems with the way SBC was opening its local systems to other companies. Yesterday, the department said SBC had sufficiently improved its performance in one area: providing high-capacity communications lines used to link other companies' switching centers.</p>
