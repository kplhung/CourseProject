        <p>GORE LEADS CASH PARADE -- Vice President Al Gore continues to pull in the cash for his party. This week he raised $2.4 million for the Democratic National Committee at six dinners. That brings the total that he has raised for the party since the end of March to $15.8 million, not including the $5 million he helped raise with President Clinton in Hollywood ($2.8 million) and New York ($2.2 million). The events this week included two dinners each, back to back, in Manhattan, Dallas and Los Angeles. Next up is a fund-raiser for the party on May 24 in Washington, where the host, Terry McAuliffe, has promised a record-breaking single-night haul of more than $21 million.</p>

        <p>BUSH HONING FOREIGN POLICY SKILLS -- Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, ever eager to burnish his foreign policy credentials in the presidential campaign, plans to attend a conference of American and Mexican governors from border states next month in Sacramento. The event is being organized by Gov. Gray Davis of California, a Democrat who is an ally of Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Bush's expected rival in the presidential race. Governors Bush, Gray and Jane Dee Hull, an Arizona Republican, will meet on June 1 and June 2 with their counterparts from six Mexican border states. A spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, Mindy Tucker, said yesterday that the agenda included education, economic development and the environment. Last month, Mr. Bush met with President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico at the dedication of the eight-lane, $128 million World Trade Bridge in Nuevo Laredo, just over the border from Texas.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>A KENNEDY DEFENDS HIMSELF -- Representative Patrick J. Kennedy met today in Los Angeles with an airport guard who said he had assaulted her. They were there to view a videotape of the incident and to give their versions of events to a hearing officer. Lawrence Webster of the city attorney's office said a decision would be made in about a week on whether to file misdemeanor charges against Mr. Kennedy, a Rhode Island Democrat and rising star of his party. The guard, Della Patton, 58, said Mr. Kennedy shoved and grabbed her on March 26 after she told him his bag was too big to fit through an X-ray scanner at Los Angeles International Airport. Rather than filing a misdemeanor battery charge, which carries a penalty of up to six months in jail and a $2,000 fine, the city attorney's office ordered today's hearing in hope of resolving the case. Mr. Kennedy, 32, the son of Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, has expressed regret for acting rudely, but has denied hurting the woman. Ms. Patton's lawyer, George L. Mallory Jr., said his client ''desires to go forward with a criminal case.'' In a statement after the hearing, Mr. Kennedy said ''there is absolutely no question'' that the accusations were inaccurate.</p>
