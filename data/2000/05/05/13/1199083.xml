        <p>Adam Petty, the only fourth-generation athlete in American sports and part of the famous Nascar auto racing family, died yesterday after crashing during practice at New Hampshire International Speedway. He was 19.</p>
        <p>Petty's car appeared to brush the wall on Turn 3 of the 1.058-mile track in Loudon, N.H., spin out and then slam into the wall. Petty was preparing for yesterday's qualifying for today's Busch 200.</p>
        <p>The roof of his red and blue No. 45 Sprint PCS Chevrolet had to be cut open to remove him as the crowd looking on fell silent. He was rushed to Concord Hospital, where he died of head trauma, a hospital spokeswoman said.</p>
        <p>It was the first car driver's death at a Nascar event since 1994, at Speedweek in Daytona Beach, Fla., when the Winston Cup drivers Neil Bonnett and Rodney Orr each died in separate crashes. John Nemechek died after a crash during a Nascar truck series event in Homsetead, Fla., in 1997.</p>
        <p>Petty was the great-grandson of one of stock-car racing's early stars, Lee Petty, who won three season titles; the grandson of the sport's most successful driver, Richard Petty, with seven season titles; and the son of Kyle Petty, at 39 a Winston Cup series regular and the head of Petty Enterprises. Lee Petty, 86, died April 5 after complications from surgery for a stomach aneurysm.</p>
        <p>''This is a tremendous loss for everyone associated with Nascar racing,'' 25-year-old Dale Earnhardt Jr. said. ''Adam and I came into the sport at roughly the same time, so I looked at him almost like a classmate. We shared a lot of interests and we shared a lot of laughs. He was always smiling and easygoing.''</p>
        <p>Kyle Petty was headed back from Europe yesterday with his daughter and was unavailable to comment.</p>
        <p>Adam Petty made his first appearance on the Nascar Winston Cup Series circuit on April 2, the same day that Earnhardt won his first cup race in Dallas. Petty started 33rd and wound up 40th.</p>
        <p>''Any time there is a loss of life, it is tragic, but to lose someone with the youth and vigor of Adam Petty cuts especially deep,'' said Michael Kranefuss, a Nascar owner. ''It goes further than what his family has meant to motor sports. He was truly a special, special person, and one of the bright lights of our sport and our society.''</p>
        <p>One snapshot that will endure is of Adam at age 1, being hoisted onto Richard Petty's shoulders in Victory Lane after his grandfather won the Daytona 500.</p>
        <p>''As young as he was, I think that day he decided he had such a good time that he was coming back,'' said Chip Williams, a veteran Nascar publicist. ''All he ever wanted to do was race cars. I've never seen anyone happier to be racing. Really, I've never seen anyone happier to be doing anything.</p>
        <p>''He didn't have a girlfriend,'' Williams said. ''He put everything into racing, and he was one of the happiest guys on earth. He would hate to hear me say it, but he was truly a sweet boy.''</p>
        <p>Petty began racing Go Karts at age 6. He made his Nascar debut at 17 in the Nascar Weekly Racing Series, competing in 25 races. The following year, 1998, he got his initial Busch Series start, finishing 27th. Last year he started in 29 Busch races, with no victories and a high finish of fourth.</p>
        <p>This year in the Busch Series, his best finish was 12th in 11 starts.</p>
        <p>Petty Enterprises' tentative plan, after it signed a deal with Dodge to drive two of its cars when the manufacturer returns to Winston Cup Series racing next season, was to have Adam Petty drive one of them and try to win the rookie of the year award.</p>
        <p>Now, Petty's death may raise questions about what age drivers should be and how much experience they should have before being allowed to compete in the sport's upper echelon, where speeds can approach 200 miles an hour. Some argue that a famous last name can sometimes serve as a dangerous shortcut to the top.</p>
        <p>Another question that might be pondered is whether the corners at the newer tracks -- New Hampshire International Speedway opened in 1993 -- are too wide, creating more risk of cars spinning out of control, as Petty's apparently did.</p>
        <p>But those are issues for another day. Yesterday, there was too much shock.</p>
        <p>The Nascar president, Bill France, issued a statement of condolence, in particular to Petty's parents, Kyle and Pattie, and his grandparents Richard and Lynda.</p>
        <p>''The Pettys are an integral part of the sport of Nascar,'' France said. ''The entire Nascar community will miss Adam Petty.''</p>
        <p>The veteran driver Sterling Marlin said he thought of the trauma gripping the Petty family, with Adam's death coming so close after his great-grandfather's.</p>
        <p>''They have really suffered some losses in the last few weeks,'' Marlin said. ''I know they are having a hard time right now.''</p>
