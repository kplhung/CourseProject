        <p>IN 1985 and 1986, when Edwin W. Edwards was tried the first two times, Eddie J. Jordan Jr. was a low-level assistant United States attorney prosecuting drug dealers and mail thieves. He played no role in the fraud and conspiracy cases against Mr. Edwards, then Louisiana's governor. But Mr. Jordan never forgot the effect that the cases had on his boss, John Volz.</p>
        <p>Mr. Volz, the United States attorney in New Orleans at the time, had a heart attack that he attributed to stress caused by his defeat in those two trials, the first of which ended in a hung jury, the second in acquittal. He lost any hope of being appointed to the federal bench. And before long, he fled the spotlight for semiretirement in a small law office, where he remains.</p>
        <p>''It was devastating,'' Mr. Jordan recalled. ''His health declined, and perhaps his enthusiasm for the job was affected by it.''</p>
        <p>Clearly, Mr. Volz's fate weighed heavily on Mr. Jordan, the United States attorney here since 1994, as he decided whether to take another shot at the elusive Mr. Edwards.</p>
        <p>''It certainly went through my mind,'' he said. ''But I had to put that out of my head in the final analysis because I had to do the right thing, and that simply meant that I had to go forward with the case.''</p>
        <p>Today the 47-year-old Mr. Jordan can rest easy. After the stunning convictions delivered by a jury in Baton Rouge on Tuesday, he will forever be known as the man who finally nailed Edwin Edwards. As he returned to New Orleans after the verdicts, he was greeted by strangers who asked for his autograph.</p>
        <p>''I feel really gratified and vindicated,'' he said in an hourlong interview on Thursday, his first since Mr. Edwards was found guilty on 17 of 26 counts. ''There were many, many people, including friends and family members, who told me this was simply not going to happen, that this was too difficult. Some people were not diplomatic, and said that in fact it was a waste of time, a waste of taxpayers' money.''</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Jordan's aunt expressed doubts. ''She said, 'Do you really think . . . ?' '' he said. ''She was very skeptical.''</p>
        <p>The skepticism has been particularly tough for Mr. Jordan because he is black, the first African-American ever to lead the federal prosecutor's office in Louisiana's Eastern District. Mr. Edwards's strongest support has historically come from black Louisianians, many of whom consider him the first governor to address their concerns and to appoint blacks to significant jobs. Even today, Mr. Jordan recognizes that Mr. Edwards's convictions, on racketeering, fraud and extortion charges, will do little to diminish the loyalty of some blacks in the state.</p>
        <p>''I've learned to live with the fact that there is a bias for this particular politician because of the kind of legend that has become associated with him,'' said Mr. Jordan, like Mr. Edwards a Democrat. ''I can't really second-guess black citizens when they say that we were in pain and we were suffering from just rabid racism in this state and this man gave us some relief, and so we have a fondness for him.''</p>
        <p>Even so, Mr. Jordan, who has been active in various civil rights causes, does not share the admiration. ''The fact of the matter,'' he said, ''is that the bar was so low for any white politician improving the conditions for black citizens in this state that really it didn't take a lot for him to be perceived as a hero.''</p>
        <p>EDDIE JACK JORDAN Jr. was born on Oct. 6, 1952, at Fort Campbell, Ky., the military base where his father was serving. His family moved several years later to New Orleans, where his father worked as an artist and art professor. Always bookish, Mr. Jordan graduated with honors from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., and received his law degree from Rutgers.</p>
        <p>He was working as a corporate lawyer in New Orleans when he was appointed United States attorney by President Clinton, something of a surprise choice given his minimal political connections. He is known both for his measured demeanor and for his stylish dress, notably the homburg  he wore to court the day Mr. Edwards was indicted. He is a jazz aficionado, and he has lined his office walls with paintings by African-American artists, including his father, who was killed in an automobile accident a month before the trial began.</p>
        <p>During Mr. Jordan's tenure, his office has successfully prosecuted organized-crime figures, major drug traffickers and corrupt New Orleans police officers. He has also pushed for tough federal prosecution of convicted felons caught with guns, and has increased the number of minority prosecutors in his 50-lawyer office to 11 from 2.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Jordan will be remembered for the four-year investigation and four-month trial that may put the 72-year-old Mr. Edwards in prison for the rest of his life. The case began, Mr. Jordan said, with a tip from two Texas brothers who hoped to negotiate a reduction in prison terms for themselves by providing information about Mr. Edwards's alleged involvement in a questionable prison project. That was enough to obtain court-authorized wiretaps on Mr. Edwards's telephones, and investigators began to pick up information about schemes to extort millions of dollars from businessmen seeking state riverboat casino licenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jordan directed the strategic planning for the investigation and trial, but left the examination of witnesses to a team of subordinates. He shunned the limelight, he said, so he could continue to manage his office and also because he did not want the case to become an Edwards-versus-Jordan duel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jordan described Mr. Edwards as ''a very complex person'' who seemed motivated both by greed and by the adrenaline rush of  ''getting as close to the edge as possible.''</p>
        <p>With the trial over, Mr. Jordan's name is already appearing on lists of potential candidates for elected office. He said he had been encouraged to run for mayor of New Orleans  but was not interested. He said he might consider a race for district attorney, and would also like to be a federal judge.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, he embraces the hope that the Edwards verdicts will send a message that public corruption will not be tolerated in Louisiana as it has been for years.</p>
        <p>''No single case is going to turn the tide in this state,'' he said. ''But I think this is an important beginning, and we needed a catalyst for change.''</p>
