        <p>Lt. Edward Szpond, once one of the most influential officers in the Elizabeth Police Department, sits these days at a desk in the department's basement, in charge of the property room. He was reassigned to the glamorless job several years ago after the mayor of Elizabeth said he had determined that he was one of the leaders of a secretive and disruptive group of officers known as the Family.</p>
        <p>The Family, long the subject of worried talk within the department, became a public problem for the city in 1994, when a dozen officers staged a protest over what they claimed was the secret group's influence within the department and its intimidation of other officers. And so that year, the department removed Lieutenant Szpond from his position in charge of the force's day shift of officers on patrol.</p>
        <p>But even though Lieutenant Szpond, who denied any wrongdoing, is in the department's basement, the question of the Family -- its size and makeup and the extent of its possible misconduct -- continues to roil the department.</p>
        <p>There have been subsequent investigations into potential wrongdoing by the group of officers, conducted both by the department itself and county prosecutors; a grand jury report in 1998 said that nearly one-fifth of the 370-member force belonged to the Family. Officers on the force have testified under oath that the group, led by Lieutenant Szpond, conducted bizarre initiation and excommunication rituals.</p>
        <p>Among the city's minority residents, officers believed to be members of the Family have, rightly or not, gained a reputation for a range of misconduct, from physical abuse to false arrests. For a department with only four Hispanics and no blacks among its roughly 60 superior officers, the suspicions have only deepened the divide between the police and many residents.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth, a North Jersey city of 110,000 that was once a blue-collar manufacturing center, is now nearly 70 percent black and Hispanic, and many of its former jobs have dried up. Drugs and crime are prevalent problems.</p>
        <p>''The Family was originally formed as a study group,'' said Patrick Maloney, director of the police in Elizabeth from 1995 to 1997, who said the members had studied together for promotion exams. ''It was formed as a way for its people to get ahead. But it soon became a specialized unit within the department that had its own insignia. I don't know if it engaged in any illegal activities. Its biggest effect within the department was to divide the department and damage morale.''</p>
        <p>While the existence and impact of the Family have received only brief treatment in a local newspaper, many believe the damage done by the group of officers has been deeper and more persistent than previously known.</p>
        <p>In lawsuits, a criminal prosecution, a grand jury investigation and separate internal departmental inquiries, officers believed to be members of the Family over the years have been accused of intimidating new officers, using racist language, trying to control promotions and overtime payments, and planting evidence on civilians in order to manufacture drug arrests.</p>
        <p>The various investigations have produced differing results.</p>
        <p>*In 1995, the department, after reassigning Lieutenant Szpond (pronounced spond), barred him from leaving his personal car, which officials said was adorned with German Iron Crosses, on police property. Lieutenant Szpond, 62, with 33 years on the city's force, remains furious over his reassignment, and he denies that he was, or is, part of any secret group.</p>
        <p>*A 1998 grand jury report concluded that roughly 70 of the department's 370 officers belonged to the Family, and said the group's members had received preferential treatment in assignments. The report said the group's activities were ''impermissible,'' but it revealed no criminal conduct.</p>
        <p>*In 1998, a black officer committed suicide and left behind a nine-page letter claiming that he had witnessed numerous instances of other officers planting evidence on suspects. The Union County prosecutor, Thomas V. Manahan, said in a statement that an investigation into the officer's accusations had concluded that ''the allegations were unfounded or not able to be substantiated by credible evidence.''</p>
        <p>*A handful of internal departmental investigations in recent years produced sworn testimony by officers that depicts a troubled department. Officers testified that Lieutenant Szpond regularly engaged in racist slurs, and ran secret candle-lighted induction and excommunication rituals.</p>
        <p>Mayor J. Christian Bollwage and the Police Department's current director acknowledge that a group of officers known as the Family did exist and may exist in some form today. But there is little agreement on whether the group was a genuinely sinister collection of officers or merely a peculiar clique.</p>
        <p>James M. Cosgrove, the current police director, said the group's influence had been diminished or eliminated.</p>
        <p>''There was an absence of some form of leadership in the Police Department, and during this absence, some members reverted to an informal leadership and formed some groups,'' Mr. Cosgrove said. ''Hopefully, this group is not with us anymore.''</p>
        <p>But interviews with a dozen current or recently retired officers as well as with church and neighborhood leaders suggest that the Family still exists.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Michael Granzen, the minister at the Second Presbyterian Church in Elizabeth, said that for years, he heard that the department was plagued by a group of bad, racially insensitive officers known as the Family.</p>
        <p>''There is an institutional racism in the Police Department and the city of Elizabeth,'' Mr. Granzen said. ''I have worked with kids here for seven years. Some have been beaten and others falsely arrested by the police.''</p>
        <p>Just which officers belong to the Family, or who might have belonged, is unclear.</p>
        <p>Mary Rabadeau, a former officer in Elizabeth who is now in charge of the New Jersey Transit Police Department, said she once belonged to a group referred to as the Family, but she characterized it as a study group. Two current officers said that they belonged to the group, but insisted on anonymity.</p>
        <p>All of the nearly dozen officers identified as Family members in sworn testimony by officers during the department's internal investigations would not comment.</p>
        <p>The Inquiries</p>
        <p>Reports of Trouble, But No Prosecutions</p>
        <p>Concern about the Family's existence first surfaced in 1994, when a number of officers staged a sickout. Upset about what they believed was the group's influence over the allotment of overtime and other benefits, the officers also complained that the leaders of the group had harassed and intimidated officers who had opposed them.</p>
        <p>The disgruntled officers distributed fliers with about 70 names of the officers they said belonged to the Family.</p>
        <p>The dispute prompted a departmental investigation, but a number of officers interviewed recently said that the inquiry had focused not on the Family, but on who had distributed the fliers.</p>
        <p>''The department had no interest in investigating the Family or its activities,'' said Daniel Wood, a retired lieutenant.</p>
        <p>The existence of the Family again became a matter of dispute in 1998 during the criminal trial of an Elizabeth police officer. Officer William F. Burdge was indicted in an assault case, accused of an unprovoked attack on a 67-year-old woman and her brother.</p>
        <p>At trial, Officer Burdge claimed that he had attacked the woman and her brother after drugs were slipped into his drink at a local bar. The officer claimed that the Family had been behind the prank. Officer Burdge was convicted, but his allegations prompted a grand jury report.</p>
        <p>The April 1998 report confirmed the existence of the Family. It said that roughly 20 percent of the force belonged to it, and that the group had tried to run much of the department's business.</p>
        <p>The report said that the activities of the group were ''most disturbing,'' and that they did not ''further the legitimate goals of law enforcement.''</p>
        <p>In response, Mayor Bollwage said that although he was concerned about the report, he had seen no evidence of serious wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>But others were skeptical of the limited findings.</p>
        <p>''This was all about self-promotion at the expense of the city of Elizabeth and the Police Department,'' Daniel John Sargent, a retired sergeant, said of the Family. ''There was a subversion of standard police practices. There was escape from punishment if there was wrongdoing because they were members. There was a numbers game, trying to make narcotics arrests for promotion.''</p>
        <p>Prosecutors were again forced to investigate the group after the death of Officer Leon Thomas in late 1998.</p>
        <p>Officer Thomas, one of the few black officers on the force, shot himself in the head in October 1998. But Officer Thomas, according to prosecutors and city officials, left behind a nine-page letter outlining a raft of misdeeds by officers on the force.</p>
        <p>Mayor Bollwage said he had read the letter, and Mr. Manahan, the county prosecutor, said in a statement that his office had checked into the dead officer's claims. The investigation was closed, Mr. Manahan said, because there was insufficient evidence to warrant prosecution.</p>
        <p>But Officer Thomas's family, as well as a number of other black officers on the force in whom Officer Thomas had confided, remain unconvinced. Three officers, Tracy O. Finch, Michael W. Brown Sr. and Lateef Banks, said Officer Thomas had told them before his death that he had kept books full of detailed notes describing a litany of false arrests and instances of excessive force.</p>
        <p>But Officer Thomas's sister, Tawana, said the books had been taken from her brother's apartment after his death, and that only a single page had survived. The page of notes describes a September 1996 arrest in which, according to Officer Thomas, a suspect was beaten by three Family members. The officers then planted drugs on the suspect to justify the arrest, the notes claim.</p>
        <p>The officers identified by Officer Thomas did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Cosgrove, the police director, said he had never heard of any notebooks. Mr. Manahan's office said the prosecutor would not respond beyond his statement about Officer Thomas's letter.</p>
        <p>Tawana Thomas said, ''The notebooks had logs detailing police wrongdoing and discriminatory treatment by the Family since the day of Leon's hiring.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Thomas is not alone in her suspicions. A number of neighborhood leaders and public defenders say the same names come up when they hear complaints of police mistreatment or dubious arrests.</p>
        <p>''There are a number of Elizabeth police officers who usually work in teams who account for an excessive amount of very suspect drug busts,'' said James Kervic, who heads the public defenders' office in Elizabeth. He said a pattern of inconsistencies in the police reports and statements by his clients disputing the police versions of their arrests has plagued Elizabeth for several years.</p>
        <p>The Lieutenant</p>
        <p>Many Complaints Focus on One Man</p>
        <p>Much of the turmoil surrounding the existence of the Family has centered on Lieutenant Szpond. For years, he occupied one of the department's most influential positions, directing its day shift of officers on patrol.</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Szpond appears to have been, at minimum, a provocative force within the department. Mr. Maloney, the former director of the police, said Lieutenant Szpond used to arrive at work with Iron Crosses painted on his car until he was ordered to keep the car off department property. The lieutenant, according to numerous current and former officers, also liked to be referred to as ''Commander,'' in deference to his stature within the Family, and a sign spelling out ''Commander'' still hangs above his basement desk.</p>
        <p>After the 1994 sickout, Mayor Bollwage ordered that Lieutenant Szpond be removed from his post directing the day shift.</p>
        <p>''When Eddie was moved to the basement, it didn't solve the problem,'' Mr. Maloney said. ''But it made it much more difficult for him to recruit people.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, Lieutenant Szpond denied any knowledge of a group called the Family or any misconduct. ''The only family I belong to is the family of all law enforcement officers,'' he said. He also described his car's crosses as ''surfer's crosses.''</p>
        <p>But an examination of the sworn testimony given by officers during the numerous internal investigations that touched on the role and nature of the Family reveals a number of serious allegations against Lieutenant Szpond, among them:</p>
        <p>*Lieutenant Szpond has referred to blacks in Elizabeth in vividly offensive ways.</p>
        <p>*He used to refer to the department's patrol cars as his ''panzer columns.''</p>
        <p>*He liked to declare in meetings that if Hitler were alive, he would have rewarded him with an Iron Cross.</p>
        <p>*Lieutenant Szpond used to conduct candle-lighted initiation and excommunication ceremonies for members of the Family. In a strange twist, the lieutenant had the new recruits swear their allegiance to him while clutching a flag of the cartoon character Yosemite Sam.</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Szpond, when interrogated by the department, admitted using the offensive terms for blacks, but insisted that they were not derogatory or that they were terms used on the city's streets, according to transcripts of his testimony. He said the Family was nothing more than a study group, although he admitted conducting initiation ceremonies.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the fullest sworn account given of Lieutenant Szpond's role as the leader of the Family was offered by Officer William C. Capraun during a 1998 internal investigation.</p>
        <p>According to a transcript of his testimony, Officer Capraun said Lieutenant Szpond called him about a year after he joined the force in 1985. Officer Capraun said he later joined Lieutenant Szpond at the house of Mary Rabadeau, the former director of the Elizabeth Police Department and now the chief of the State Transit Police. There, he was asked to join the Family.</p>
        <p>Officer Capraun, according to his testimony, said Lieutenant Szpond told him with whom he could speak and associate with on the force. Years later, Officer Capraun testified, he was ''excommunicated.''</p>
        <p>''I want to go on the record,'' Officer Capraun testified at the hearing in December 1998, ''saying I'm a victim of extreme, bizarre behavior that went unchecked for 12, 13 and God knows how many years, that no one put a stop to that insane man that's in the basement right now that completely, ultimately destroyed this department.''</p>
        <p>Chief Rabadeau said the incident recounted by Officer Capraun never happened.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maloney, the former police director, said senior officials had been concerned about Lieutenant Szpond, but were unable to discipline him because they had no evidence that he had violated any specific department policy.</p>
        <p>''What grounds did we have for removing him?'' Mr. Maloney asked. ''He needed to have done certain things wrong, to have violated rules and regulations.''</p>
        <p>The Lawsuit</p>
        <p>Sergeant Says Officers Were Protected</p>
        <p>Sgt. John Guslavage, a veteran of 31 years on the Elizabeth police force, has long contended that the Family protected corrupt behavior.</p>
        <p>In 1995, Sergeant Guslavage sued the department under the state's whistle-blower statute, claiming that the department had shut down a drug investigation to protect members of the force, including Family members. The City of Elizabeth, the Police Department and the individual officers involved have all denied the allegations in court filings.</p>
        <p>But according to the suit, Sergeant Guslavage, then a member of the department's narcotics unit, was investigating drug sales at an Elizabeth bar in 1994. During the investigation, the suit contends, evidence surfaced that three narcotics officers, all members of the Family, were present at the bar during drug deals.</p>
        <p>But, the suit alleges, when Sergeant Guslavage reported the information to his superiors, it was ignored and the investigation was ended.</p>
        <p>Frustrated, Sergeant Guslavage took his information to the United States attorney in Newark. But according to the officer, the federal prosecutors merely turned the information over to local prosecutors.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the federal prosecutors in Newark, Michael Drewniak, said their office had informed the county prosecutor's office of Sergeant Guslavage's claim, but could not say what had become of it.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Guslavage, however, wound up accused by his own department of having gone ''out of the chain of command'' with his complaint. While no formal finding has yet been issued by the department, the sergeant is no longer assigned to the narcotics unit.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Guslavage would not expand on his lawsuit's accusations, saying he feared retaliation. A state judge will not deal with Sergeant Guslavage's suit until the department issues its disciplinary ruling.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Guslavage's fate, according to numerous officers interviewed for this article, has given rise to doubts that the Family will ever be fully investigated.</p>
        <p>''What amazes me,'' said Mr. Wood, the retired lieutenant, ''is that they have gotten away with this for so many years.''</p>
        <p>That befuddlement runs deep on the streets of Elizabeth, too.</p>
        <p>''There is a great deal of suspicion towards the police,'' said Hassen Abdellah, a lawyer and former county prosecutor. ''I hear frequent reports that the police use excessive force, on occasion use the derogatory N-word while on duty and plant drugs on suspects.  This has produced widespread feelings of fear and apprehension.''</p>
        <p>Salaam Ismial, chairman of the United Youth Council, a youth and family advocacy group, agreed. ''When you talk about police abuse, the same names keep coming up,'' he said. ''But nothing is ever done.''</p>
        <p>Richard Mixson said he is going to try. Mr. Mixson, a 27-year-old father of three, said he was falsely arrested in February 1997 by two officers -- both identified by other officers as members of the Family -- who planted drugs on him. Mr. Cosgrove said that his officers had not planted narcotics, and that they had observed Mr. Mixson going back and forth between a doorway and cars in the street in what they suspected was drug activity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mixson, who works nights as a janitor for Merck, the pharmaceutical company in Rahway, N.J., said he was outraged. And at the trial, he was acquitted.</p>
        <p>Now, he is suing, hoping to force the courts to examine the conduct of the department's officers.</p>
        <p>''I have many friends who can't get jobs, can't serve on juries and who have reached a dead end because they have records they do not deserve,'' Mr. Mixson said. ''It is criminal what is going on here, and even with the risk of a three-year jail term if I lost, I decided it was time someone in our community stood up to them.''</p>
