        <p>In 1995, in an effort to better monitor the state's most vulnerable children, state officials approved the creation of an ambitious statewide computer system. It was supposed to enable private and public social service agencies throughout the state to track child abuse reports, to find appropriate foster homes for abused and neglected children and to comply with layers of government reporting requirements swiftly and accurately.</p>
        <p>Today, the computer system, called Connections, is incomplete, and nearly three years overdue and millions of dollars over budget. Having already spent more than $200 million on contracts with two companies, IBM Global Systems and Andersen Consulting, to develop the system, the state has just approved an additional $66 million to finish the project. Most of that money will go to those companies, although $7.6 million will go to a third, Maximus, to figure out how to finish the project. Maximus has recently been criticized for the way it got contracts -- without competitive bidding -- to supervise the city's welfare-to-work program.</p>

        <p>Today, the computer system, called Connections, is incomplete, and nearly three years overdue and millions of dollars over budget. Having already spent more than $200 million on contracts with two companies, IBM Global Systems and Andersen Consulting, to develop the system, the state has just approved an additional $66 million to finish the project. Most of that money will go to those companies, although $7.6 million will go to a third, Maximus, to figure out how to finish the project. Maximus has recently been criticized for the way it got contracts -- without competitive bidding -- to supervise the city's welfare-to-work program.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, at a hearing in lower Manhattan, State Assembly members heard firsthand of the fruits of the state's multimillion-dollar investment. Officials with private foster care agencies testified that the computers the state purchased were no more than glorified word processors, on which a case report was composed and then transmitted by e-mail to the appropriate government agency for review.</p>
        <p>Officials of some foster care agencies said they maintained paper files because they found the computerized system unreliable. And ultimately,  they said, caseworkers end up devoting so much time to filling out papers and plugging data into computer systems they have not mastered that they are left with little time to help families in crisis.</p>
        <p>''It is time to recognize that Connections has been, from the get-go, an overly ambitious and extraordinarily costly boondoggle,'' said Marjorie McLoughlin, executive director of Cardinal McCloskey Services, a Catholic social services agency.</p>
        <p>No one quite knows when the project will be finished. And although additional funds have been set aside for finishing the job, Assemblyman William L. Parment, a Democrat from Chautauqua County, questioned why taxpayers should shoulder all of the expenses.</p>
        <p>''IBM and Andersen should bear a greater cost of making this system work,'' said Mr. Parment, who is chairman of the Assembly's Committee on Oversight, Analysis and Investigation, one of three committees that called yesterday's hearing.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the State Office of Children and Family Services,  William Van Slyke, said the project had been delayed because the software package developed by Andersen did not satisfy the child welfare agencies.</p>
        <p>Officials of Andersen, which was hired to develop the software, attributed the delays to state officials. In an interview yesterday, Judy Teller, a partner with the company, said that Andersen had delivered the software package to the State Office of Children and Family Services in the fall of 1997 and had waited ever since for the state to decide what changes needed to be made.</p>
        <p>''We have delivered the software, they have looked at it,'' Ms. Teller said. ''We are in discussions with them on exactly what they'd like to change.''</p>
        <p>Although Connections is incomplete, Mr. Van Slyke contended it had already improved data collection statewide. Children's case reports are now computerized, instead of written on paper forms. Caseworkers can track, through the system, a child's case history throughout the state.</p>
        <p>''It's like the first mission to the moon, this project,'' he said. ''It's a dramatic change.''</p>
        <p>Still, no one disputes that the system has not delivered its original promise. It is not yet possible to record where a foster child is placed; nor can the system handle billing and payment arrangements.</p>
        <p>The Connections system has already come under fire from the State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, whose audit earlier this year found that millions of dollars in computer equipment could not be accounted for. Last year, another audit found that not only was the project far behind schedule, but also that the parts of the system that were up and running were not always working properly.</p>
        <p>''It is still in disarray,'' Mr. McCall said yesterday. ''It still does not function. The costs continue to escalate. We have a system that is not working that costs much more than was intended.''</p>
