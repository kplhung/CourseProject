      <abstract>
        <p>Mitchell L Moss Op-Ed article says that for New York State Republican party there is no greater priority this year than keeping control of state Senate, which will deal with Congressional reaportionment next year; says that for Republican leaders like Sen Joseph Bruno the rationale for Rudolph Giuliani's US Senate candidacy is evaporating, now that mayor has marital and health problems that make campaign far less plausible (M)</p>

        <p>Last summer, there was no more enthusiastic backer of Rudolph Giuliani than Joseph Bruno, the New York State Senate majority leader and upstate Republican. While some Republicans worried about the mayor's card-carrying Republican credentials as a United States Senate candidate, Mr. Bruno's calculation was pragmatic.</p>
        <p>He believed that Mr. Giuliani would run well in the suburban counties surrounding New York City, and thereby help maintain the Republicans' 36-25 majority in the State Senate.</p>

        <p>Last summer, there was no more enthusiastic backer of Rudolph Giuliani than Joseph Bruno, the New York State Senate majority leader and upstate Republican. While some Republicans worried about the mayor's card-carrying Republican credentials as a United States Senate candidate, Mr. Bruno's calculation was pragmatic.</p>
        <p>He believed that Mr. Giuliani would run well in the suburban counties surrounding New York City, and thereby help maintain the Republicans' 36-25 majority in the State Senate.</p>
        <p>While electing a Republican to fill the seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan is the most visible party priority this year, the principal goal of most G.O.P. leaders and officeholders in New York is to maintain secure control of the State Senate. This is not just parochial self-interest. Should Republicans lose control, they would have virtually no voice in the reapportionment next year of the state's congressional districts.</p>
        <p>With so much at stake, it wasn't surprising that as the mayor's marital difficulties spilled into public view last week, Mr. Bruno led the Republican hierarchy in warning Mr. Giuliani that they could disrupt his campaign.</p>
        <p>Redistricting is the responsibility of the State Legislature; the governor plays no direct role in drawing up the plan. Democrats are likely to keep control of the New York Assembly, where they have a 2-to-1 advantage, regardless of which party wins the United States Senate seat. But if Republicans lost just six seats in the State Senate, the Democrats would be in the rare position of controlling both houses.</p>
        <p>This would result in a new set of congressional districts with boundaries that favored Democrats. The New York congressional delegation, which consists of 18 Democrats and 13 Republicans, is likely to lose one seat because of the 2000 census. If the Democrats redrew the boundaries, it is easy to count four fewer Republican seats. Incumbent Republicans would be forced to run where they are not well known, and where their likely opponents would be high-profile Democrats. For example, Representative Vito Fossella, a Republican elected in 1996, might find his safe Staten Island congressional district including a larger Democratic base in southern Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>The realignment in New York is crucial to national Republicans as well. It is already apparent that both houses of the California Legislature will be in the hands of Democrats, who will be looking to redraw the map to their advantage. It is hard to imagine a more unpleasant turn of events for the national G.O.P. than losing its slim majority in the House in a few years, simply because Democrats controlled the legislatures in the largest and third-largest states.</p>
        <p>There are 4.9 million Democrats and 3 million Republicans registered to vote in New York State. Republican candidates cannot win if their ideology undermines their appeal to moderate voters. Until recently, Republican leaders hoped that Mr. Giuliani's popularity would overcome George W. Bush's limited appeal in the state.</p>
        <p>This year, the Republicans are especially vulnerable in Nassau and Westchester counties, where the party machines have broken down. In Westchester, the Democrats control the county executive's office and have recently won seats in local elections, while in Nassau County, the local Republicans are being blamed for fiscal mismanagement and surging deficits.</p>
        <p>For the Republican leaders, the rationale for the Giuliani candidacy is evaporating. Winning a United States Senate seat would be a luxury, but keeping control of the State Senate is a necessity.</p>
