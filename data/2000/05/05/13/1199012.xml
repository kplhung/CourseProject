        <p>John Charles de Wilde, a retired economist for the State Department and the World Bank, died on April 27 at his home in Redwood City, Calif. A former resident of Alexandria, Va., he was 89.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Wilde, who was born in Boskoop, the Netherlands, graduated from Harvard University in 1930 and did advanced studies in economics at Columbia University and the University of Kiel, Germany. He was a correspondent of the Foreign Policy Association in Germany before World War II, when the United States government posted him to the Board of Economic Warfare for service in London and India.</p>
        <p>After the war, he worked for the State Department, assigned to the Marshall Plan, until 1950, when he joined the staff of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, created by the United Nations in 1945. He led many economic missions for the bank to the Middle East, Africa, Asia and the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>He came to specialize in African agriculture and economic development and promoted entrepreneurship in the third world. He formally retired in the mid-1970's but continued to serve as a consultant to the World Bank and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations into the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Wilde is survived by his wife of 61 years, Martha Millar de Wilde; two sons, Jan, of Geneva, and Dick, of Menlo Park, Calif.; a brother, Louis, of McLean, Va.; and five grandchildren.</p>
