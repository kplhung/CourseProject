        <p>Wall Street's role in the financing of abusive lenders was the theme of a public hearing that federal regulators held yesterday in the financial district, but none of the invited business speakers showed up.</p>
        <p>''I think it was that nobody wants to defend it,'' said Andrew M. Cuomo, the federal secretary of housing and urban development, who presided at the session and commented later. Organizers said they had asked several financial institutions to send representatives.</p>
        <p>Nearly 30 other witnesses did appear, however, and testified for several hours about the problems of what critics call ''predatory'' lenders, who single out minority borrowers with limited credit and offer loans with relatively high interest rates. The speakers included several borrowers, community group advocates, public officials, academics and representatives of the lending industry.</p>
        <p>''We're in one of Wall Street's houses, but Wall Street's not here,'' said one witness, John Taylor of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, an advocacy group. The hearing was in the New York Mercantile Exchange at the World Financial Center.</p>
        <p>The flourishing ''subprime'' home-equity market pushes loans to people with limited credit ratings, charging higher than average interest. Predatory lenders are a subset focusing on minority neighborhoods, and especially elderly homeowners, using deceptive tactics to pressure them into loans with exorbitant fees and interest that they cannot afford to repay. Borrowers often end up in bankruptcy or foreclosure.</p>
        <p>Secretary Cuomo called the predatory lenders ''bottom feeders,'' ''con men'' and ''scam artists,'' but he  gave the financial industry the benefit of the doubt. ''I don't think that Wall Street investors are aware of the problem,'' he said. ''I believe they would be as surprised by these revelations as anyone else, and once they are aware they will quickly distance themselves from it.''</p>
        <p>Critics call that view naive and say that Wall Street is well aware of the issue.</p>
        <p>In April, Moody's Investors Service issued a report on the rising number of complaints about predatory lending but was generally reassuring to investors. ''Predatory lending allegations, no matter how unseemly, will not affect most subprime mortgage securitizations,'' Moody's said.</p>
        <p>Wall Street companies have come under increasing scrutiny because they underwrite subprime lenders, including the predatory ones, and resell their bundled loans, making fresh money available for them to issue more loans.</p>
        <p>As an example, a speaker from the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, an advocacy group, asserted yesterday that Merrill Lynch -- which has offices in the World Financial Center near the hearing site -- was the nation's third-largest underwriter of subprime lenders. The critics also said that the company itself made 800 home loans in the New York area in 1998, of which only five were for black or Hispanic borrowers. A company representative did not return phone calls left last night requesting comment.</p>
        <p>A few dozen protesters from Acorn planned to march to Merrill Lynch, seeking to meet with company officials. Acorn's leaders said that state park police officers and city police officers had threatened to arrest demonstrators and tried to bar them from the hearing and from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        <p>A confrontation was averted, however, when a Merrill Lynch representative approached the protesters and talked about arranging a meeting.</p>
        <p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development is also holding hearings in Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago and Los Angeles in an effort to press for changes. Speakers yesterday called for more statistical reports to track the problem, self-policing in the industry, public education, more enforcement of existing rules and the adoption of new regulations. They have an ally in Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer, who was at the meeting, called the victims' testimony ''heartbreaking.'' Gail Floyd of Philadelphia described how her request for a $1,500 loan to convert her oil furnace to gas snowballed into a refinancing of two old mortgages totaling $25,000 at 9.5 and 11 percent, plus $7,000 in fees and points, for a new $33,000 loan at 12 percent. Anther woman, Marie Morency of Brooklyn, said she was about to lose her home in foreclosure.</p>
