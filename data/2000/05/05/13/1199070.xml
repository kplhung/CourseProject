        <p>The 37-year-old rookie was leaning against a wall outside the visiting clubhouse at Shea Stadium, smiling.</p>
        <p>Joe Strong never stopped smiling. He had made his major league debut on Thursday night, becoming the oldest rookie in major league baseball in 40 years, so everything made him smile.</p>
        <p>Strong had played minor league baseball for 11 years, had played in five different countries and even quit the game for two years.</p>
        <p>But Strong revived a career that seemed to be over by going to pitch in Korea in 1998. It did not seem like a shrewd career choice for a 35-year-old, but it somehow worked.</p>
        <p>''I really didn't think it was going to amount to this much,'' Strong told a radio station about the attention he has received.</p>
        <p>''I thought I would be able to sneak in, do some work and go back when these guys came back. Apparently, I was wrong, real wrong.''</p>
        <p>After pitching one and one-third scoreless innings against the Braves in Florida's 5-4 victory Thursday, Strong became the oldest rookie since Diomedes Olivo appeared for the Pirates as a 41-year-old on Sept. 5, 1960.</p>
        <p>Strong took a few deep breaths as he walked in from the bullpen and reminded himself to ignore the hype.</p>
        <p>Forget about the 343 games in the minor leagues or those lonely years in places like Mexico, Taiwan and, of course, Korea.</p>
        <p>''I made sure I was under control,'' said Strong, who was 1-1 with a 4.67 earned run average at Class AAA Calgary. ''I didn't want to get caught up in all that.''</p>
        <p>But everyone else did. Strong said he did 12 telephone interviews from his hotel room yesterday and figured that he might have to do 20 more once he got to Shea Stadium yesterday. He finished a radio interview as a group of New York reporters approached and he said:</p>
        <p>''You got to get me after batting practice. I'm a rookie. Don't forget.''</p>
        <p>The rookie was late for stretching exercises, and Strong's teammates told him he would be fined. Still, Strong smiled.</p>
        <p>He lifted weights while he was out of pro baseball for two years and working at a Sears store, and he felt that the layoff actually strengthened his arm. His fastballs were clocked at 95 miles an hour against the Braves.</p>
        <p>''I haven't slept a wink,'' Strong said about the period after his debut.</p>
        <p>''The way things went tonight, I'll probably never sleep again.''</p>
        <p>Since Strong, who is single, had pitched in so many different cities and countries, he was asked to name his favorite place.</p>
        <p>The 37-year-old rookie did not hesitate.</p>
        <p>''Right here,'' Strong said. ''Right now.''</p>
