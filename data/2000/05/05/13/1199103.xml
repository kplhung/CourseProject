        <p>Jeff Van Gundy and Pat Riley have been tugging at the officials like Silly Putty over the last couple of days in an attempt to find more favorable calls for their star players.</p>

        <p>Jeff Van Gundy and Pat Riley have been tugging at the officials like Silly Putty over the last couple of days in an attempt to find more favorable calls for their star players.</p>
        <p>Riley has been lobbying on behalf of Jamal Mashburn and Alonzo Mourning, while Van Gundy has depicted the Miami Heat's players as everything but muggers with their hands-on defense of Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston. But even Van Gundy had to laugh yesterday at the transparent politicking between himself and Riley after the Knicks' coach spent several minutes ranting about the inhumane treatment being given to Sprewell and Houston by Dan Majerle and Bruce Bowen.</p>
        <p>''I don't think Game 2 was called tightly on the perimeter,'' Van Gundy said, getting wound up on the issue of officiating at the Knicks' morning shoot-around. ''I thought it was called very loosely on the perimeter. I thought it was called very tightly inside. I think it should be just the opposite. I think a lot of contact should be let go with big guys, and it should be called a lot tighter outside. In the last game, it was the other way around.''</p>
        <p>Of course, under Van Gundy's logic, Mourning would have been in foul trouble before the first timeout of Game 3 last night at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>''We don't foul Mourning,'' Van Gundy said while laughing out loud. ''Wait. You've got to know the coach's side. We don't foul Mourning, and they're killing our guys. That's how it is.</p>
        <p>''After one game, to see the reality that can be drawn from two points of view, it's beautiful. We can't touch Mourning, and they think Mourning is getting hammered. And we think Houston and Sprewell are abuse victims. It's amazing.''</p>
        <p>The overly dramatic back-and-forth was not lost on Riley, either.</p>
        <p>''Jeff wants a little more room for Allan and Sprewell,'' Riley said. ''He's learned his lessons well from us in Miami. I talked about the officials the day before, and now he's trying to get more room for his guys. Our perimeter guys are not putting hands on them. Our guys are trying to defend with their feet.''</p>
        <p>In the Looking Glass</p>
        <p>After being hailed as a hero for his defense on Vince Carter and his Game 2 offensive heroics against the Toronto Raptors in the first round, Latrell Sprewell has found the limelight a little uncomfortable against the Heat.</p>
        <p>Under the microscope leading up to Game 3 of the four-of-seven-game series last night, Sprewell had shot just 6 for 25 from the field, turned the ball over seven times and had allowed Jamal Mashburn to average 23 points a game.</p>
        <p>''It's still early,'' Sprewell said. ''I think there is a little more attention on me, especially after the first round. I like it, though. I like the challenge. I need to have a good series against Mashburn. We'll see how the rest of this series goes.''</p>
