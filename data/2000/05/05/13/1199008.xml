        <p>President Vladimir V. Putin today offered a backhanded defense of a police raid at the corporate headquarters of Russia's largest private media empire, noting in a statement that ''all are equal before the law, no matter what business they are in.''</p>
        <p>The raid Thursday by federal agents at several corporate offices owned by Media-MOST, a holding company controlled by Vladimir Gusinsky, continued to draw criticism today as even rival newspapers condemned the government for trying to intimidate its critics in the press.</p>
        <p>In his statement, Mr. Putin repeated his commitment to freedom of speech, a principle he cited in his inauguration speech last Sunday. ''This attitude does not depend on the position taken by this or that publication or channel, nor to what degree that position agrees with that of the authorities,'' read a statement issued by the Kremlin press service.</p>
        <p>But, the statement added, media companies cannot seek immunity from criminal investigations. ''No attempt at blackmail in relation to law enforcement is permissible, just as limits on freedoms of speech and of the mass media are not permissible,'' it said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin, now five days in office as Russia's second president, has moved briskly this week to strengthen Moscow's control over the country's unruly provinces, issuing several decrees that annul specific regional laws that have been found to violate the Russian Constitution. In meetings with parliamentary deputies, he indicated he would back a reform of the Parliament's upper chamber that would bar regional governors and local legislative leaders from automatically being assigned double roles as Russia's ''senators.''</p>
        <p>But the sudden move against Media-MOST, at the end of a drawn-out political battle between Mr. Gusinsky and top Kremlin officials, was seen as a political setback for the new Putin administration, which was widely accused of waging a political vendetta against Mr. Putin's political enemies.</p>
        <p>Speaking today on an interview program on Ekho Moskvy, a radio station that belongs to the Media-MOST empire, Mikhail Y. Lesin, Russia's press minister, argued that the investigation was directed at wrongdoing by the MOST corporation, and not the media outlets it controls. This distinction, he said, meant that press freedoms had not been endangered by the raids on Thursday.</p>
        <p>A spokesman at the general prosecutor's office said the investigation was focusing on MOST's security services, which reportedly number 2,000 employees, whose eavesdropping and surveillance tactics violated the law.</p>
        <p>But few politicians or journalists today were satisfied with these explanations. ''It was a demonstrative action linked not only with the competitive battle of Russian television channels but also with information which the authorities do not like, '' said Moscow's mayor, Yuri M. Luzhkov.</p>
