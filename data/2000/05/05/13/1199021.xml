        <p>In January 1918, a month-old boy was discovered in a basket in the Gimbels department store in Manhattan, and as he changed hands from a sales clerk to store officials to the New York Nursery and Child's Hospital, someone along the way named him Arthur Field.</p>
        <p>Five years later, after bouncing from one foster home to the next, Arthur boarded a train bound for Iowa, where he would finally get a set of parents, and a new name.</p>
        <p>With that, Art F. Smith, now 82, became one of 200,000 orphaned, abandoned or poor children sent west between 1854 and 1929 as part of a broad but little-known social experiment. Like many others who had traveled on what was known as the Orphan Train, Mr. Smith has recounted his life tale perhaps a thousand times, particularly at reunions like the ones held every year in New York.</p>
        <p>But now that more than seven decades have passed since the last Orphan Train headed west, the reunions have dwindled, and the one that opened Thursday night and continues through tonight at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square could be the last time Mr. Smith gets to reminisce with the people who shared his historic exodus.</p>
        <p>''More and more of them leave us every year,'' said Philip Coltoff, executive director of the Children's Aid Society, one of the founders of the Orphan Train Movement. ''It's an ever-shrinking number of original riders who can come back.''</p>
        <p>The Orphan Train Movement carried orphaned or abandoned children from New York and other East Coast cities west to small towns, as part of a social experiment by Children's Aid, the New York Foundling Hospital and other nonprofit organizations. Only a few hundred of the original train riders are still alive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith, a tall man with a lurching stride, said he remembered only one thing about his New York childhood: a large pan of apple peels served as Thanksgiving dinner in one of his foster homes. In 1922, he was removed from the home and placed with Children's Aid, which included him in a group of 12 children aboard a train bound for Iowa. He remembers the trip vividly.</p>
        <p>''The ladies had a big box with sandwich fixings and fresh fruit and fresh milk,'' Mr. Smith said. ''But they couldn't keep it fresh for long, so along the way farmers would meet the train and sell them fresh fruit and milk. It was December and it was cold. We looked out the windows and saw things we had never seen before -- cows, horses, chickens.''</p>
        <p>When the train arrived in a small Iowa farming town called Clarinda, a large group of farmers gathered at the station to greet the children. According to a local news report, 5-year-old Arthur climbed up onto a man's lap and asked, ''Are you going to be my daddy?'' The man and his wife, Worley and Lillian Smith, who had gone to the station simply out of curiosity, took him home.</p>
        <p>At the reunion Thursday night, Mr. Smith traded quips with Fred Swedenburg, 81, who was 6 in 1925 when he and his brother Howard Hurd, 78, left New York by train, headed for Nebraska. The two boys had been removed from their Victor, N.Y., home after their mother was charged with ''scandalous neglect,'' Mr. Swedenburg said. Mr. Hurd's first memories were of the hard wooden seats on the train, which deposited the boys in separate homes, about 20 miles apart in two Nebraska towns, Clarks and Stromsburg.</p>
        <p>Both men credit the Children's Aid Society with saving their lives. ''How long would two boys have lived if they were on the street at 3 and 6 years old?'' Mr. Hurd asked. Between them, they now have 16 children, 41 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren.</p>
        <p>Although many of the train riders were orphaned or severely neglected by their parents, the Orphan Train Movement has often been criticized for removing children from homes simply because they were children of poor, mostly immigrant, families, considered ''the dangerous classes'' by turn-of-the-century social reformers.</p>
        <p>Although the reformers argued that children would be better served by the fresh air and wholesome hard work of rural America than the city's squalor, the movement's critics charged that the children were often placed on farms where they were treated as slave laborers.</p>
        <p>The orphan trains did not find a permanent home for William E. Oser, whose father died of ''paralysis'' when he was 11 months old, he said, and whose mother died of tuberculosis 12 months later. He and his sister Marge were sent by train to Michigan in 1925, but were returned to orphanages in New York two years later after social workers found that they were being abused by their adoptive parents.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, trains came to define Mr. Oser's life. After leaving the orphanage, he got a job on the railroad, where he stayed for 42 years. He ultimately become a general supervisor at Grand Central Terminal and retired at 61.</p>
        <p>The last orphan train left for Texas in 1929. The youngest known living train rider, Bill B. S. Woodruff, 73, is one of just 22 who joined Thursday's New York reunion, along with about 125 spouses and children. They continue to tell their stories, they said, because they believe that this part of America's past has been left out of the history books.</p>
        <p>''I didn't find out until I was 71 that I was part of something,'' Mr. Smith said. ''I knew I was sent out to Iowa with a bunch of kids, but I didn't know there were 200,000 of us. All of us were surprised to learn about it, and now wherever we go, we try to tell people our story.''</p>
