        <p>Re ''Moms Marching for Gun Control'' (editorial, May 11): Besides the million moms marching in Washington on Sunday, there are millions more of us who for many different reasons can't make the long trip that day to express ourselves. But rest assured, we, too, are incensed and frustrated that our government has not responded to the cries and photographs of children killed or terrified because of the ease with which anyone can get his hands on a gun.</p>

        <p>We must have tougher gun laws that are strictly enforced on a national as well as a local level.</p>
