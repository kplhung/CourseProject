        <p>Police officers found a stolen truck trailer on a deserted street in Queens last night, but it was missing 20 drums of potassium cyanide, a highly poisonous chemical.</p>
        <p>Upon entering the truck shortly after midnight clad in biohazard suits, members of the city's Emergency Services Unit saw that the drums and other contents of the trailer were gone.</p>
        <p>''There is nothing in the truck but packaging debris and other debris,'' said Richard J. Sheirer, director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management, who was at the scene.  He added that there was also no sign of any residue of cyanide, which is a white powder.</p>
        <p>The chemical can be used for making bombs, but there was no indication that terrorists were involved in the theft.</p>
        <p>The trailer was taken from a warehouse in Linden, N.J., last week, the police said.</p>
        <p>''It may very well be that someone stole the truck not knowing what was in it,'' a federal law enforcement official said. ''Nobody is panicking.''</p>
        <p>Since the drums, which are orange and about the size of beer kegs,  were reported missing on May 4, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey State Police and Union County prosecutors have followed the investigation closely.</p>
        <p>Last night, the federal law enforcement official confirmed that F.B.I. agents had gone to Queens to assist in the investigation. Officials urged anyone who sees the barrels to report them to the police and to keep their distance.</p>
        <p>A police spokesman, Joseph Pentangelo, said the containers were marked with the shipper's number 1680, which is used nationally to designate potassium cyanide.</p>
        <p>The trailer, without a cab, was found at 31st Place and Borden Avenue, in an area of factories and warehouses in the Long Island City section of Queens. The authorities sealed off 31st Place.</p>
        <p>Potassium cyanide has a common industrial use in electroplating. It has also been used in suicide pills.</p>
        <p>The chemical was one of several found in the possession of members of the Aum Shinrikyo religious sect, which killed 12 people in a sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995.</p>
        <p>The trailer had been scheduled for delivery by ship to Puerto Rico.  Police said cargo thefts are common in Linden, which is near the ports of Elizabeth and Newark.</p>
        <p>Detective Lt. Jeffrey Vitrano of the Linden police would not name the warehouse where the theft occurred.</p>
