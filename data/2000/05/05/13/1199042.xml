        <p>In her first public remarks on a sexual harassment case that has roiled the Army, Lt. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy said tonight that women in uniform who face harassment needed to report it immediately to friends and superiors or ''misconduct will continue to harm us.''</p>
        <p>''If discrimination or misconduct is not reported at an appropriate time, then public policy may never change,'' she said in a forceful tone. ''And this discrimination and misconduct will continue to harm us and others.''</p>

        <p>In her first public remarks on a sexual harassment case that has roiled the Army, Lt. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy said tonight that women in uniform who face harassment needed to report it immediately to friends and superiors or ''misconduct will continue to harm us.''</p>
        <p>''If discrimination or misconduct is not reported at an appropriate time, then public policy may never change,'' she said in a forceful tone. ''And this discrimination and misconduct will continue to harm us and others.''</p>
        <p>General Kennedy's remarks appeared to reflect second thoughts about her own handling of her allegations against Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith, whom she accused of making unwanted sexual advances in her office in the Pentagon in 1996.</p>
        <p>She did not report the alleged incident to her superiors at the time, making her accusation only last fall, when the Army appointed General Smith to be deputy inspector general. In that post he would have investigated cases of sexual harassment.</p>
        <p>General Kennedy made her remarks at a ceremony this evening honoring her 31 years of military service. Addressing more than 100 people at the memorial to Women in Military Service to America, which adjoins the Arlington National Cemetery, General Kennedy quoted the French novelist Emile Zola that he lived on earth ''to live out loud.''</p>
        <p>''Living out loud begins by telling a friend and then later telling people in authority who care,'' she said. ''Our army is filled with women and men who care and are in a position to change and improve the conditions in which we serve.''</p>
        <p>In the wake of the investigation of her accusation, many women in uniform have said that they fear making accusations when confronted with sexual harassment because doing so often leads to close examination of their personal lives and harms their careers because they are labeled as troublemakers.</p>
        <p>But in her remarks tonight, General Kennedy said that women should feel able to come forward even though that was not what she initially did.</p>
        <p>Military officials said they were able to confirm General Kennedy's accusation through interviews with friends and colleagues with whom she discussed the 1996 incident.</p>
        <p>Although she did not discuss details of the investigation or make any direct reference to the incident with General Smith, she said there needed to be a public discussion of the forms of discrimination that women could face in the military.</p>
        <p>''I think there are three major and very different dynamics we're been talking about for the last month -- and really for the last several hundred years,'' she said. ''And that is that there are unwanted sexual advances. There is sexual harassment. And there is sexual assault. Each is very different. Each is very well defined, and I think we need to have much more discussion about these.''</p>
        <p>She received an ovation at the end of remarks from an audience that included dozens of senior female officers, as well as civilians.</p>
        <p>Until today, she had not spoken publicly about her accusations or the Army's handling of them, and she has repeatedly declined a barrage of requests for interviews.</p>
        <p>Tonight's reception was a private one, organized by several advocacy organizations, including Women in International Security, the Army Women's Professional Association and the National Women's Law Center. The Army plans to hold an official retirement ceremony after her last day as deputy chief of staff for intelligence on June 2. She will officially retire in August.</p>
        <p>Despite the inspector general's findings, which were delivered this week to the vice chief of staff of the Army, Gen. John M. Keane, the case may not be closed during her last months in uniform.</p>
        <p>General Smith now has a chance to challenge the findings, which if upheld would very likely lead to a reprimand and the end of his career. Army officials indicated today that he planned to contest the accusations, beginning what could be a lengthy legal battle.</p>
        <p>General Kennedy's career has long been cited as a symbol of the progress women have made in the military, especially as men-only domains within the services opened their doors to women over the last decade. The furor over her accusations has also made her a symbol of the difficulties that women say they still face.</p>
        <p>''I think, unfortunately, this incident has detracted from the great job General Kennedy has done throughout her career,'' said the secretary of the Army, Louis Caldera, who did not attend tonight's reception because he was in San Antonio to deliver a commencement address.</p>
        <p>People close to General Kennedy say she never intended her accusation against General Smith to become the embarrassment that it has for the Army. Even when she did come forward with her accusation last fall, after General Smith's appointment, she did not want to spur a formal investigation -- and certainly not a public scandal, they said.</p>
        <p>Instead of withdrawing the appointment, as the Army has often done when such accusations are raised, it began an inquiry.</p>
        <p>After news of the investigation became public, some accounts included disparaging comments from unnamed Army officials about General Kennedy and her career. The Pentagon's inspector general opened an investigation of General Kennedy after a retired Army officer accused her of personal misconduct in the 1980's, but the matter was dropped for lack of evidence.</p>
        <p>Among those in the audience was Sgt. Rhian T. Davies, a 28-year-old member of the Army band at Fort Sam Houston in Texas, who flew on a military flight from San Antonio to be at the event. She said she had met General Kennedy briefly last year at an army conference and had been so inspired that she wanted to see her again before she retired.</p>
        <p>''Who am I? I'm Sergeant Nobody. And she took time out to talk to me about career options,'' Sergeant Davies said. ''She left me with a positive vision of the future of the Army.''</p>
