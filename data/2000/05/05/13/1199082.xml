        <p>PAT RILEY is back in town, the venerable crunch-time coach who brought you Showtime in Los Angeles, Short Time in New York and now Zo Time in Miami. Last night Riley pulled another rabbit out of his hat with Alonzo Mourning saddled with fouls and Tim Hardaway barely able to walk. The Heat forced the Knicks to play one of those nasty, head-butting, arm-wrestling games that used to be New York's signature but now is just something they do whenever they play Miami.</p>
        <p>Patrick Ewing's jumper with 2.6 seconds left sent this brutal Game 3 into overtime. But then the rookie Anthony Carter -- Miami's rabbit in the hat -- threw up a shot from almost behind the basket with 2.7 seconds left in overtime to give the Heat a 77-76 victory. The Heat managed to beat up the Knicks, retake home-court advantage and take a 2-1 lead in the four-of-seven-game series.</p>

        <p>PAT RILEY is back in town, the venerable crunch-time coach who brought you Showtime in Los Angeles, Short Time in New York and now Zo Time in Miami. Last night Riley pulled another rabbit out of his hat with Alonzo Mourning saddled with fouls and Tim Hardaway barely able to walk. The Heat forced the Knicks to play one of those nasty, head-butting, arm-wrestling games that used to be New York's signature but now is just something they do whenever they play Miami.</p>
        <p>Patrick Ewing's jumper with 2.6 seconds left sent this brutal Game 3 into overtime. But then the rookie Anthony Carter -- Miami's rabbit in the hat -- threw up a shot from almost behind the basket with 2.7 seconds left in overtime to give the Heat a 77-76 victory. The Heat managed to beat up the Knicks, retake home-court advantage and take a 2-1 lead in the four-of-seven-game series.</p>
        <p>Once again, just when you were about to write off Riley, call him a thing of the past, he gives himself another day.</p>
        <p>Of all the coaches who patrol the National Basketball Association sidelines, Riley has left the most intriguing footprints. More intriguing than Lenny Wilkens, though he has not coached as long, more intriguing than Phil Jackson, though he has not won a recent championship.</p>
        <p>Riley represents a thick slice of history and evolution in the N.B.A., from substance to style. He is part of the transition of an era when the N.B.A. devoured college basketball.</p>
        <p>The footprints leave a trail from Schenectady, N.Y., to Lexington Ky., and Adolph Rupp's segregated world of basketball. To a journeyman player's career: San Diego, Los Angeles, Phoenix. Then to the Lakers' radio network, to their bench as an assistant, then as head coach, inheriting one of the N.B.A.'s great teams, anchored by Magic, Kareem and Worthy.</p>
        <p>Riley fashioned the Knicks into his own image of a grinding, nasty, mean team. Now Riley, at age 55, seems stuck. After nearly 20 seasons of coaching, four N.B.A. championships, motivational books and lectures, he seems stuck between gears. He pulls a rabbit out of the hat every now and then, as he did last night, but one game is not a series. No one thinks of him much as a magician anymore. The Heat has not gone beyond the second round of the playoffs since 1996-97.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday the Knicks swooped in and took away Miami's home-court advantage for the fourth consecutive year. Last night the Heat snatched it back. This was a Riley masterpiece, forcing the Knicks to play Miami's game when defense reigned. ''I thought it was a beautiful game,'' he said. ''Absolutely a beautiful game.''</p>
        <p>After Tuesday's loss, Riley made an interesting point. He said the team worked hard for 82 games to earn the home-court edge. ''We gave it all back in one two-hour stand,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That has become the Heat: tearing through the regular season, going all out on a Wednesday night in December to win a meaningless game. When the playoffs arrive, Miami is beaten down by the intensity of its own heat.</p>
        <p>Last night Riley praised his team and took a jab at his critics. ''We came up here to win,'' he said, ''and a lot of people have been writing us off -- we are not this, we are not that -- and our guys take it a little personal.''</p>
        <p>Riley is the coach and president of an empire he created, but he has lost track of time and a sense of timing. One talk-show host in Miami calls Riley ''Stand Pat Pat'' because he has kept the nucleus together so long. Too long.</p>
        <p>This is a critical series for Riley. A third straight elimination by the Knicks, another year without reaching the finals, would chip another piece of contemporary Riley lore.</p>
        <p>Larry Bird understands that success is dependent on players. That is why he is getting out of coaching. When Riley was in Los Angeles, he was in awe of Kareem and Magic. With each successive head-coaching job, he seems to have embraced a narcissism that puts him at the center of every universe.</p>
        <p>The Heat is limited to a brawling style of basketball that used to define the Knicks. But the Knicks have added Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby while Miami has stood pat.</p>
        <p>Riley is the last of the supercoach era, but his luster is wearing thin, though a game like last night's, a series like this one, revitalizes the image. But in the larger view, something has to change in Miami.</p>
        <p>The other day someone asked Hardaway how his injuries were affecting his play. Hardaway said, ''I can see places I want to go, but I can't get there.''</p>
        <p>A fitting portrait of a franchise, and of a coach who used to be the king of crunch time.</p>
