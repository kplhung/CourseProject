        <p>Improved weather conditions today stabilized the fire that has destroyed huge swathes of forest and residences here and threatened a major nuclear weapons laboratory. But as officials scrambled to prepare for higher winds expected over the weekend, they said it would be at least a week before thousands of residents forced to evacuate could return to the area.</p>
        <p>With residents and politicians angrily asking why National Park Service officials started the controlled burn a week ago that grew and swept past firebreaks on Thursday, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said today that he was suspending all such deliberate fires in the West for 30 days.</p>
        <p>Park Service officials, concerned about bone-dry conditions in the region, started the fire, called a prescribed burn, to thin densely wooded areas and, it was hoped, prevent a surprise fire from igniting. But with high winds and low humidity, firefighters quickly lost control of the blaze, which has now burned for more than a week.</p>
        <p>Federal officials and New Mexico's senators have called for investigations into the handling of the fire. The superintendent of the Bandelier National Monument, where the prescribed burn was set, has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.</p>
        <p>At a news conference at the Los Alamos airport, Mr. Babbitt defended the use of prescribed burns, but he said that he and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman ''agreed it would be a good idea to pause.''</p>
        <p>In spite of today's stabilization, Joe King, the manager of Los Alamos County, said the continuing risk that high winds could turn the fire back through the area meant none of the 18,000 people evacuated would be permitted to move back until the end of next week at the earliest.</p>
        <p>Many residents despaired at the news, since thousands of them fled their homes earlier this week with little more than a few minutes notice, and with few of their belongings.</p>
        <p>Given the heavy smoke that settled over the entire region today, though, more people appeared eager to leave the area than return for now.</p>
        <p>A city official said that an assessment had determined that the fire had charred a total of 32,000 acres in and around the town, which is home to the Los Alamos National Laboratory, one of the country's most important nuclear weapon research centers.</p>
        <p>The fire was still expanding today, the official said, but not as rapidly, and the conditions are letting firefighters bring in larger helicopters and special airplanes to attack selected areas of the fire in a bid to limit the damage.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of acres on the grounds of the laboratory, which encompasses about 42 square miles, were burned. But Kevin Roark, a spokesman for the laboratory, said that only two trailers and one truck were destroyed and that no radioactive or other sensitive materials stored at the site were at risk.</p>
        <p>Some people have raised concerns that the wildfire might blow into the atmosphere some mildly radioactive waste dumped in several canyons at the site decades ago. But Mr. Roark insisted there was ''no risk whatsoever'' of such releases.</p>
        <p>He said that the laboratory had numerous sensors for detecting releases of radiation, and that others were being distributed in towns around the region to ensure that any leaks would be picked up quickly.</p>
        <p>A federal Department of Energy report last year estimated how much exposure residents might receive in a worst-case scenario, one in which every laboratory building containing radioactive waste and other nuclear material was incinerated. The calculations also included radiation released by fire from contaminants in the soil and plants.</p>
        <p>The total, less than 6 millirems a person in a 50-mile radius around the laboratory, is ''quite a bit smaller than what you get from natural sources,'' said Connie Soden, director of the environmental safety and health division of the Department of Energy in Albuquerque.</p>
        <p>Los Alamos city officials said today that the fire had destroyed 271 housing units in 191 structures; they began posting those addresses on a special Web site. Many more homes, the officials added, had suffered some damage.</p>
        <p>At Santa Fe High School, which was being used as a shelter for evacuees, Los Alamos residents gathered around televisions and computers to learn the latest about the fire and their town.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Leta and Alan Picklesimer, who both work at the laboratory, watched their home of 13 years go up in flames.</p>
        <p>''We have to stay,'' Mr. Picklesimer. ''We have jobs there. Whether we'll rebuild, we just don't know. We just feel lost. We're marking time. We want to get started doing something but there's nothing to do.''</p>
        <p>The reduced winds, which eased to less than 20 miles an hour today after gusting at more than 60 miles an hour on Thursday, helped firefighters today, but they also allowed a heavy pall of grayish smoke to descend over hundreds of square miles. For the first time the city of Santa Fe, about 30 miles to the south, was covered in a mild haze, the smell of woodsmoke filling the chill air.</p>
        <p>The less powerful winds meant that fire officials could deploy several special tanker planes capable of pouring thousands of gallons of water at a time.</p>
        <p>Still, fire officials said that they had no hope of bringing the wildfire under control for perhaps a week or so, and that in some areas a wall of flames two to three miles across was blackening acres of dense pine forest.</p>
        <p>The fires were mostly moving to the north and northeast of Los Alamos, which rests on a plateau more than 7,200 feet high, but were now moving in the direction of the Santa Clara Pueblo, a large, sparsely populated Indian domain.</p>
        <p>Officially, only the towns of Los Alamos and White Rock, which has suffered no fire damage, have been evacuated. But residents of many nearby towns, such as Abiquiu and Espanola, have left voluntarily both because of the growing pall of smoke and ash and out of concern that a shift in the winds could bring the fires back. Officials have estimated that more than 25,000 people have left, most to join friends or family members elsewhere in the region.</p>
