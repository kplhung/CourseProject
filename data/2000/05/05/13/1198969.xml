        <p>The Metropolitan Opera's Millennium Celebration served so many purposes on Thursday night that one scarcely has room to list them.</p>
        <p>First, the evening collected three acts from Met productions, each with a famous tenor in the lead. The amalgam was a benefit performance for the company's pension fund. For a numerous and dressed-up audience, presumably donors, music provided a prelude for a postculture dinner upstairs. Serving as appetite builders were Act II from Giordano's ''Andrea Chenier,'' Act IV of Bizet's ''Carmen'' and Act III of Puccini's ''Turandot.''</p>

        <p>The Metropolitan Opera's Millennium Celebration served so many purposes on Thursday night that one scarcely has room to list them.</p>
        <p>First, the evening collected three acts from Met productions, each with a famous tenor in the lead. The amalgam was a benefit performance for the company's pension fund. For a numerous and dressed-up audience, presumably donors, music provided a prelude for a postculture dinner upstairs. Serving as appetite builders were Act II from Giordano's ''Andrea Chenier,'' Act IV of Bizet's ''Carmen'' and Act III of Puccini's ''Turandot.''</p>
        <p>The evening also marked the end of a long season, with three grueling cycles of Wagner's ''Ring'' just ended. The wonderful Met orchestra and chorus under James Levine sounded distracted, underrehearsed, tired or perhaps a bit of all three on Thursday, but no one seemed to mind.</p>
        <p>This was also an unofficial Three Tenors concert, although here the great men were dispersed and provided with more visual aids than usual. Having Placido Domingo (admitting to 59), Jose Carreras (54) and Luciano Pavarotti (65) singing Giordano, Bizet and Puccini, respectively, the evening also took on the look of a senior citizens' committee conducting business for some tenors' association.</p>
        <p>A relaxed, almost casual atmosphere seemed to emanate from both sides of the footlights. Patrons popped their flash cameras freely, and house officials lifted not a finger in rebuke. Chorus members muddled intricate passages, while stage and pit missed probably more connections than in any other Levine-conducted performance this season.</p>
        <p>The stage pictures themselves looked bright and shiny. Presented were Nicolas Joel's straightforward street scene from Revolutionary Paris, Franco Zeffirelli's bone-dry bullring exterior in Seville and Mr. Zeffirelli's Las Vegas vision of mythical oriental splendor, complete with descending golden sprinkles at the end.</p>
        <p>The tenors themselves were freshest of all. Even Mr. Carreras's challenged resources seemed tightly pulled together and fiercely concentrated. Under stress, his voice is not a pretty thing; but maneuvering well in lower registers, Mr. Carreras made a strong impression.</p>
        <p>His two colleagues are, of course, Met stalwarts if not Met heroes. Mr. Domingo sang with what one can only call an ageless brilliance. The quality was remarkable. Mr. Pavarotti's voice today is perfectly recognizable. If the phrasing is angular and fragmented, the enunciation is superb, and there is enough of that distinctive ring remaining to make us know in an instant who is up there singing. I'm not sure I would have wanted to follow Mr. Carreras or Mr. Pavarotti through the perils of complete performances, but I'm sure Mr. Domingo could have sung all night.</p>
        <p>Various heroines were also at work. In ''Andrea Chenier,'' Daniela Dessi sang ardently. Lorraine Hunt Lieberson was an excellent Carmen. The ''Turandot'' finale offered Patricia Racette as an equally ardent Liu and Jane Eaglen in the title role, sounding somewhat subdued after the recent rigors of the ''Ring.''</p>
