        <p>Ukraine, the former Soviet state that is one of the largest recipients of American and international aid, deliberately provided false data to the International Monetary Fund on a wider scale than previously thought, according to a report released today.</p>
        <p>An I.M.F.-ordered investigation by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that Ukraine's central bank arranged 21 transactions during a one-year period ending in January 1998 that exaggerated the size of its foreign reserves.</p>
        <p>The transactions falsely inflated the reserves by as much as $713 million, prompting the fund to release loans of $200 million that it otherwise would have withheld, the accounting firm determined. The firm did not find any evidence that central bank authorities personally profited from diverted funds.</p>
