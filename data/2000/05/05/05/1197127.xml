        <p>The art critic Harold Rosenberg once remarked, apropos of Stanley Kubrick's ''Barry Lyndon,'' that ''the movies could make their maximum contribution to culture by recycling unread literature.'' In the quarter-century since, certain moviegoers have been treated to enough lavish costumes and exquisite diction to overwhelm every waste-transfer station in the New York metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>''Up at the Villa,'' directed by Philip Haas from a screenplay by his wife, Belinda Haas, selects, as though from a pile of empty aluminum cans, a lesser novella by W. Somerset Maugham, but its contribution to culture is minimal. It reminds us that Italy is beautiful, that Fascism was a dreadful nuisance and that Sean Penn is a great actor, deserving of better vehicles than this vintage lemon.</p>

        <p>The art critic Harold Rosenberg once remarked, apropos of Stanley Kubrick's ''Barry Lyndon,'' that ''the movies could make their maximum contribution to culture by recycling unread literature.'' In the quarter-century since, certain moviegoers have been treated to enough lavish costumes and exquisite diction to overwhelm every waste-transfer station in the New York metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>''Up at the Villa,'' directed by Philip Haas from a screenplay by his wife, Belinda Haas, selects, as though from a pile of empty aluminum cans, a lesser novella by W. Somerset Maugham, but its contribution to culture is minimal. It reminds us that Italy is beautiful, that Fascism was a dreadful nuisance and that Sean Penn is a great actor, deserving of better vehicles than this vintage lemon.</p>
        <p>The film follows a recipe carefully copied from the Merchant-Ivory cookbook, which calls for a gorgeous location (in this case, Florence), a sprinkling of top-drawer international actors and a soupcon of big historical trouble. ''Things will settle down after Munich,'' someone is heard to remark early in the proceedings, so you know that the storm clouds of war are gathering on the horizon, and you may find yourself wishing, as the film slogs from dinner party to dinner party, from villa to palazzo, that the darn things would hurry up and break.</p>
        <p>The Haases, who have also brought to the screen high-class contemporary works like A. S. Byatt's ''Angels and Insects'' and John Hawkes's ''Blood Oranges,'' serve this familiar dish half-baked. They turn Maugham -- an efficient, unfussy storyteller whose fiction has, over the years, proved perfectly congenial to filmmakers -- into a third-rate Henry James, a doddering, half-awake observer of the bottled-up passions of twittering Anglophones in a foreign clime.</p>
        <p>The story is simple, interesting enough, and would benefit from a crisp, straightforward presentation instead of the slow, talky, sodden treatment it receives here. Mary Panton (Kristin Scott Thomas) is an English widow at loose ends in Tuscany who has a weekend to decide whether to accept the marriage proposal of Sir Edgar Swift (James Fox), an imperial muckety-muck with one of the stiffest upper lips in cinema history. But in his absence she meets Rowley Flint, an American adventurer played by Mr. Penn, whose lower lip, with its twitches, pouts and smirks, is a most impressive instrument.</p>
        <p>Mary resists Rowley's advances, and instead goes to bed, out of pity and social conscience, with an impoverished Austrian refugee named Karl Richter (Jeremy Davies), whose knowledge of English seems to consist entirely of romantic cliches, and whose suicide when Mary won't sleep with him a second time falls into the same category.</p>
        <p>But at least it brings the movie, briefly, to life. When Richter bursts into Mary's villa the night after their dalliance, a whiff of violence and unpredictability is allowed to penetrate the stuffy, perfumed air. And for half an hour or so, Mr. Haas forsakes postcard pornography and Masterpiece Theatricality in favor of good old-fashioned film-noir intrigue. Mary enlists Rowley to save her from the consequences of her folly, and Mr. Penn does what he can to rescue the movie from its stultifying lack of imagination, impersonating a man of the 1930's, as he did in Woody Allen's ''Sweet and Lowdown,'' in the style of a movie star from an earlier era.</p>
        <p>Speaking of which, who should be prowling the salons of Florence in a series of remarkable hats but Anne Bancroft, as the grande dame of expatriate Florentine society. It's tempting to say that she and Mr. Penn are miscast, but the movie is such a slapdash affair that one is grateful for the odd, inventive Actors Studio inflections they bring to it, like a jolt of bourbon in a cup of weak tea.</p>
        <p>But this is a movie in which people actually exclaim ''by Jove,'' in which suave Continental types kiss the hands of fluttering Englishwomen, and in which nearly every scene is drenched in Pino Donaggio's swelling, oppressive, dentist-office score. ''Up at the Villa'' is a sluggish, literal-minded exercise in vulgar prestige-mongering that flatters itself that it is a contribution to culture.</p>
        <p>''Up at the Villa'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It contains sexual situations and minor violence.</p>
