        <p>The House today decisively approved legislation that grants more than 70 African and Caribbean countries broad new trading privileges by expanding duty-free access to American markets.</p>
        <p>In an unusually strong bipartisan vote, 309 to 110, lawmakers backed a compromise bill that House and Senate negotiators worked out over the last several months, with aides toiling into the early hours this morning to finish the fine print.</p>
        <p>Supporters hailed passage of the bill as a boost for the flagging economies of sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean because it would reduce or eliminate tariffs and quotas on a range of goods made in those regions. Opponents, largely from textile-producing states, warned of devastating job losses in the American apparel industry.</p>
        <p>President Clinton strongly supports the measure, which now goes to the Senate for a vote and likely passage as early as next week. The legislation would be the first substantial trade measure enacted in the United States since approval of the Uruguay Round in 1994, which established the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>''This important measure will strengthen our economic partnership with these nations, lower trade barriers and help developing nations to lift their people out of poverty,'' Mr. Clinton said today.</p>
        <p>Passage of the bill may enhance the prospects for an even larger China trade bill that the House will vote on this month. About five wavering House Democrats have conditioned their support for the China measure in part on passage of the African and Caribbean bill, including some members of the Congressional Black Caucus.</p>
        <p>''It certainly does provide momentum, and it's an encouraging development for trade votes in general,'' Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, told reporters in a conference call.</p>
        <p>But some lawmakers may use their vote in favor of today's bill to give them political cover to vote against the China measure.</p>
        <p>In Congress today, foes and supporters of the China measure held dueling news conferences. Proponents announced the names of 10 new supporters -- 6 Democrats and 4 Republicans -- but acknowledged that they did not change the mathematics of the coming vote because they had already included the lawmakers in their head counts.</p>
        <p>Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the measure's chief Democrat opponent, announced a new web site for the opposition (http:// No2PermanentMFN.house.gov). A wavering Democrat, David Phelps of Illinois, said he was now leaning against the measure.</p>
        <p>The African and Caribbean measure's bipartisan support -- unusual for trade bills these days -- saw 126 Democrats joining 183 Republicans in favor. Voting against were 78 Democrats, including Richard A. Gephardt, the Democratic leader; 30 Republicans, and 2 independents.</p>
        <p>''By promoting expanded trade, the United States will be minimizing the need for foreign aid and disaster relief,'' Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said.</p>
        <p>Supporters helped grease the vote by tucking in several provisions with little or no relation to Africa or the Caribbean. For instance, the measure offers breaks for Israeli nylon woven into Caribbean-made garments and men's suits made with Canadian wool.</p>
        <p>Another provision directs the trade representative to change the method of punishing countries whose trade practices are deemed unfair to the United States. The office would be told to rotate its punishments among different product groups, to spread the pain and to make the retaliation less predictable. This was, in part, a favor to Carl H. Lindner, an Ohio executive and political fund-raiser, whose Chiquita Brands International is in a trade war with Europe over bananas.</p>
        <p>Last year, the House and Senate approved different versions of the measure. Since then, negotiators sought a compromise. But it took the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, and Mr. Hastert of the House to break the logjam three weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Under the compromise, the House agreed to grant many of the same duty-free benefits to 24 Caribbean and Central American countries that 48 African nations will get.</p>
        <p>The House had not included the Caribbean in its legislation because of objections from lawmakers in textile states who fear that a flood of imports from the region could imperil American jobs.</p>
        <p>The Senate dropped its insistence that duty-free imports from Africa be made with fabric, yarn or thread from the United States.</p>
        <p>In a concession to textile-makers, the agreement initially caps the volume of duty-free goods at 1.5 percent of all textile imports. That cap grows to 3.5 percent over eight years.</p>
        <p>As a result, the value of textile imports from Africa is expected to rise to $4.2 billion in 2008 from $250 million last year.</p>
        <p>The poorest African countries -- all but six of sub-Saharan nations -- would be eligible for duty-free status with no restrictions for four years.</p>
        <p>''This means investment and investment means capital, which will enable these countries to clear the land, build the factories, train the workers, produce something, and know there's a market for it,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York.</p>
        <p>The compromise includes tougher provisions against Asian imports that are passed off as African-made apparel. But lawmakers from textile-producing states predicted disaster.</p>
        <p>''This bill would imperil the livelihood of thousands of textile workers,'' said Representative Robin Hayes, a North Carolina Republican.  But the Textile Manufacturers Institute, a trade group, said it would not oppose the measure.</p>
        <p>The compromise dropped a provision in the Senate bill aimed at helping make AIDS drugs more affordable in Africa. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, urged the White House to carry out the provision by executive order.</p>
