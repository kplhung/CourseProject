        <p>The phrase ''strategic alliances'' has been echoed on the Internet for years, but only in recent weeks has it been heard in the museum world. Last month came the news that the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan and the Tate Gallery in London were joining forces to initiate a dot-com business that would run as a separate entity whose profits would be channeled back into the two institutions.</p>
        <p>This week the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis announced their first joint acquisition: Matthew Barney's ''Cremaster 2: The Drones' Exposition,'' the fourth video installation in his planned five-part saga.</p>
        <p>''Once you put aside institutional ego and start thinking about what's best for your audience, it makes sense,'' said Kathy Halbreich, director of the Walker. ''Visitors don't care who owns what, as long as they have good access to it. And this will allow it to be shown more.''</p>
        <p>''Cremaster 2'' includes sculptures, photographs and drawings that elaborate themes and motifs explored in a 79-minute film tracing the rise and fall of the antihero Gary Gilmore, the convicted murderer. It is loosely based on ''The Executioner's Song,'' Norman Mailer's chronicle of Gilmore's life and his execution in 1977.</p>
        <p>While neither institution would say how much they paid for the work, ''Cremaster 2'' is large, both conceptually and physically. When it was first shown at the Walker last summer, the installation took up about 2,500 square feet.</p>
        <p>''Richard Flood, our chief curator, has had a long-term commitment to Barney's work, and that made all this possible,'' Ms. Halbreich said. (The Walker is the only museum in the United States to have all of Mr. Barney's ''Cremaster'' films in its permanent collection.)</p>
        <p>David A. Ross, director of the San Francisco museum, said: ''There couldn't have been a more ideal artist or opportunity to explore this kind of collaboration. Works like this are so huge and complex that the times we will be able to show the whole thing are few and far between.''</p>
        <p>''Cremaster 2'' will be on view in San Francisco from May 20 to Sept. 5. It will later travel to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan to be part of a Barney retrospective scheduled to open in February 2002.</p>
        <p>After that, following Mr. Barney's wishes, ''Cremaster 2'' is to be divided between the two museums for three years, after which they will exchange parts. But if one museum wants to show the entire installation, it can do so by mutual agreement with one year's notice.</p>
        <p>Guggenheim Lines</p>
        <p>It was an unbeatable combination: ''Project for a New Guggenheim Museum in New York City,'' an architecture exhibition featuring the Los Angeles architect Frank O. Gehry's design for a museum that the institution hopes to build along the East River in Lower Manhattan, and a retrospective of the work of Nam June Paik, the Korean-born video artist. The museum broke all its previous attendance records.</p>
        <p>In the week of April 16, 31,966 visitors went to the Guggenheim on Fifth Avenue. That figure eclipsed the 27,415 who flocked to ''The Art of the Motorcycle'' two years ago. While the motorcycle show drew a record 301,000 during its 10-week run, the museum estimates that more than 500,000 will have viewed ''Project for a New Guggenheim Museum in New York City'' by the time it closes in the fall.</p>
        <p>Lisa Dennison, the museum's deputy director and chief curator, attributes this success to a combination of factors. For starters, the overwhelming attention that greeted the Guggenheim Bilbao in Spain, also designed by Mr. Gehry, has made people curious. So has the way the exhibition deals with how Mr. Gehry went about designing such an engaging building. ''People are always asking about the process of a project,'' Ms. Dennison said. ''The presentation here shows everything from paper cutouts to highly sophisticated models.''</p>
        <p>To the Future</p>
        <p>Investment banks aren't the only businesses being raided by dot-coms. Last week Mark Poltimore, Christie's deputy chairman in Europe, an expert on 19th-century art and one of the company's most talented auctioneers, resigned to become a managing director of eAuctionRoom.com. A new Paris-based Internet company, it will feature live auctions online.</p>
        <p>''After 23 years at Christie's I thought it was time for a change,'' Mr. Poltimore said. ''I'd never forgive myself for not trying something like this. It's the future.''</p>
        <p>Sotheby's has had a defection, too. Paul Donaher has left Sotheby's after three years, most recently as its worldwide head of marketing, to become chief marketing officer for Concrete Media, a three-and-a-half-year-old New York-based Internet company that specializes in building Web businesses for clients.</p>
        <p>Change at Frick</p>
        <p>Even though the Frick Collection has a Web site and an audio guide, it still has a reputation as an antiquated institution, more like a private club than a museum. Since Henry Clay Frick, the Pittsburgh industrialist, died in 1919 and left his home at 1 East 70th Street and his art collection to a board of trustees with instructions that it become a study center for art, the institution has had a nine-member board. But this week the museum announced that it had decided to expand its board to 11 seats.</p>
        <p>The two new members are Margot Campbell Bogert, chairwoman of the board of Sarah Lawrence College; and Melvin R. Seiden, a Frick supporter for more than 20 years who was chairman of the Frick's council in 1995 and 1996 and is a life fellow of the Morgan Library.</p>
        <p>Another new face on the board is Nicholas H. Hall, a dealer in old master paintings, who as the new council chairman is ex officio. He replaces Patrick Gerschel, who resigned this year.</p>
