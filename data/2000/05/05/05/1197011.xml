        <p>The skies were blue and the breezes moderate, but a surprise ended a Westchester golf tournament yesterday: two armed men making a getaway across the links.</p>
        <p>The day dawned perfect for golf at the Siwanoy Country Club in Bronxville. By 10:30 a.m., professionals strolled the tree-lined fairways of the 114-acre club, having just completed the first round of the MasterCard Westchester P.G.A. championship.</p>
        <p>Then the police arrived with dogs, helicopters and guns drawn, and evacuated the course, said David Henion, the club's first assistant golf professional. ''That's when we found out about the armed people on the golf course,'' he said. ''You'd think it was a nationwide manhunt.''</p>
        <p>An assault and attempted robbery in a nearby home minutes earlier fractured the peace of a residential neighborhood, said Lt. William Curran of the Eastchester police.</p>
        <p>About 10:23 a.m., a man in his home at 87 Highland Avenue -- which abuts the golf course -- heard unusual noises downstairs and went to investigate, Lieutenant Curran said. There, he was confronted by a man with a gun, who marched him into the kitchen and made him lie face down on the floor. The gunman and an armed companion then pistol-whipped the resident. During the beating, one of the guns discharged, shattering a glass door.</p>
        <p>The victim fled to the home of a neighbor, who called the police.  While the man was taken to nearby Lawrence Hospital, where he was in stable condition yesterday, the police  focused on the attackers' best escape route: the golf course.</p>
        <p>''I saw a lot of police running, with guns drawn,'' a club employee who stayed on the course recalled.'</p>
        <p>Although upset, the players filed into the club house and ate turkey sandwiches, said Mr. Henion. They played cards for two hours, until they got the all clear. ''People would call up and we'd say, 'The course is closed.' 'Why? It's a beautiful day?' '' The response, said Mr. Henion: ''We kind of have some armed guy out on the golf course.''</p>
        <p>Despite a five-hour search, the men escaped, said Lieutenant Curran.</p>
