        <p>She was standing outside my office, her long blond hair cascading like Niagara Falls down her shoulder. One look at those legs and I knew this one would be trouble.</p>
        <p>Hang on, hang on, hang on. That doesn't sound right. Let's start over.</p>
        <p>Ruby Slade had done an awful lot of living for someone on the near side of 20. Not much of it was good.</p>
        <p>No, that doesn't make it, either. Dang, this business of writing a mystery story is harder than it looks.</p>
        <p>But it took a swing by the Grand Hyatt Hotel the other day to realize just how difficult making a go of it can be. Really hard. But doable.</p>
        <p>That seemed to be the message of a symposium held at the hotel for the benefit of hopeful men and women with visions of becoming the next Grisham or Cornwell. Some had already been published, and more than once. But they were still in search of the big kahuna, the book that could bring megadeals and a one-way ticket to La-La Land.</p>
        <p>The conference was organized by the Mystery Writers of America and was one of several events leading to the group's presentation of its annual Edgar Allan Poe Awards last night. What happened at the awards dinner is itself a mystery to us, though. We never made it.</p>
        <p>''Dress to kill,'' the invitation said. But nothing in the closet remotely worked. You try living with clothes that can't even wound, let alone kill. So we stuck with the symposium, which offered hints from writers, editors and publishers on how to go about shaping suspense tales to die for.</p>
        <p>''Anybody who has a really good mystery could be tomorrow's millionaire,'' said Walter Wager, who has not done badly for himself at this craft. One of his books, ''58 Minutes,'' was the basis for the movie ''Die Hard 2.''</p>
        <p>He mentioned that he had a new novel called ''Tunnel'' (Forge/Tom Doherty and Associates), about former East German agents who, Mr. Wager said, ''go for a big heist and hijack the Lincoln Tunnel.'' Frankly, we thought that had been done, by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. But why not try a variation?</p>
        <p>The good news at this symposium was that the mystery novel -- or ''crime fiction,'' as the writer Lawrence Block preferred -- remains a vibrant form.</p>
        <p>Some people have fretted that it may be done in by today's lower homicide rates. You may recall that similar concerns were expressed about the suspense thriller soon after the cold war ended. But there are always fresh villains in need of a good throttling. If not the Soviets, then the Iraqis. If not Iraqis, then Serbs. After the Serbs, who knows? Why not the dot-com geeks?</p>
        <p>And all a mystery writer needs, after all, is one good juicy murder.</p>
        <p>That and an agent, cautioned John Baker, editorial director of Publishers Weekly. Mary Higgins Clark, the best-selling author, agreed. Without an agent, she said, ''it's almost impossible.''</p>
        <p>Even with one, life for a writer today can be an ordeal, said John Feldcamp, chief executive of Xlibris, an online publishing services company in Philadelphia. The major publishing houses are taking on fewer new mystery writers, he and others said. Their focus seems to be more on brand-name authors who will land on best-seller lists as surely as Leonardo DiCaprio will wind up bold-faced in gossip columns.</p>
        <p>''If you're holding a first novel in your hand right now,'' Mr. Feldcamp said, ''your chances of being published are one in 400.''</p>
        <p>A collective gasp of surprise and dismay arose from some in the audience.</p>
        <p>Ah, but there are ways to improve the odds, speakers advised.</p>
        <p>Like giving your sleuth an interesting specialty. (No reason why someone who goes antiquing couldn't find himself wrapped in a mystery, Mr. Baker said.) Or like writing in depth about a place. Or maybe putting a child in danger. ''A missing child is a grabber,'' Ms. Clark said. ''I've left kids alone for a while, but if things get tough, you never know.''</p>
        <p>No one argued with Mr. Baker when he said that even more than a good plot, a mystery writer must have a strong voice. O.K., we can do that.</p>
        <p>Then he added, ''Editors seem to be looking for a sassy female voice these days.'' Gulp! Where does that leave us Y chromosome types?</p>
        <p>Perhaps the answer is to take Ms. Clark's advice, maybe with a ripped-from-the-headlines twist. That's it! Forget the blonde.</p>
        <p>Elian Gonzalez had done an awful lot of living for someone on the near side of 7. Not much of it was good.</p>
        <p>It sings.</p>
