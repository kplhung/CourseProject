        <p>Immigration officials at Kennedy International Airport detained a prominent moderate Islamist political leader from Jordan for a long interrogation and sent him home on the next flight, he said, prompting high-level protests to embarrassed American diplomats here today.</p>
        <p>The traveler, Ishaq Farhan, 67, a senator and university president, arrived on Tuesday in New York on a Royal Jordanian Airways flight from Amman. He had planned to visit a son and daughter who live in the United States and to give talks to American Islamic groups. Mr. Farhan's Jordanian diplomatic passport was stamped with a five-year multiple-entry visa valid until December 2003, the latest in a series of United States visas that he had since graduating with a doctorate from Columbia University four decades ago.</p>
        <p>On presenting his passport, Mr. Farhan said, he was taken to a room where officers from the Immigration and Naturalization Service told him that the State Department had revoked his visa and requested that he be interrogated. He recounted:</p>
        <p>''They asked me: 'Do you belong to a terrorist organization? Do you believe in terrorism?' I said, 'No,' and, 'No, that I believed in democracy and that I learned about democracy studying in the United States.' ''</p>
        <p>After six hours of questioning, he said, he was ordered to buy a $2,000 one-way ticket on KLM flights back to Amman, double the cost, he said, of his original round-trip excursion fare. ''Financially speaking, morally speaking,'' Mr. Farhan said, ''it was a bad experience. This shouldn't happen between two countries that respect one another.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Farhan, a leader of the Islamist Action Front, Jordan's biggest political party, said the immigration officials had told him that he would not be allowed to re-enter the United States for at least five years.</p>
        <p>The State Department said today that it had revoked his visa last year, but that it had not notified him. Officials declined to explain the move, except to note that grounds for such actions would include suspected terrorist associations or convictions for crimes.</p>
        <p>''We recognize that Dr. Farhan is highly respected in Jordan and is well-known to the U.S. Embassy there,'' a spokesman said. ''The matter is under review.''</p>
        <p>Two officials declined to say whether an apology would be extended. ''It's not something we're happy about,'' one said.</p>
        <p>The United States ambassador here, William Burns, called Mr. Farhan today to ''express his concern'' about the incident and ''promised to try to find out what happened and what can be done about it,'' a spokeswoman for the embassy said.</p>
        <p>American diplomats in Jordan said they were unaware of information that would merit interrogating or deporting Mr. Farhan, whom they consider an important moderating force. Mr. Farhan, who held cabinet posts under the late King Hussein, opposed the Islamist boycott of the last general elections and has kept a distance from the vociferous opposition to peaceful relations with Israel.</p>
        <p>The detention and expulsion touched a raw nerve in Jordan, which considers itself the closest United States ally in the Arab world but sometimes resents what it considers an American inability to distinguish between mainstream Islam and extremist fundamentalism.</p>
        <p>The incident was headlined in most major newspapers today. The foreign minister called Mr. Burns to seek an official explanation.</p>
