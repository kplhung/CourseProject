        <p>The drama that has been unfolding here in recent weeks has all the ingredients of the convoluted soap operas that Brazilians love to watch: a power struggle, betrayal, sexual intrigue, jealousy, revenge.</p>
        <p>But most of all it is money, lots and lots of money, that has brought about the downfall of Celso Pitta, mayor of Sao Paulo, South America's largest and richest city.</p>
        <p>The crisis began, appropriately enough, on prime-time television in mid-March. In an interview, Mr. Pitta's estranged wife, Nicea, accused her husband of tolerating a web of corruption that she said was inherited from his predecessor and included some of Brazil's most prominent political figures.</p>
        <p>''He wasn't strong enough not to get involved with all that corruption ensconsed in City Hall,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pitta's patron, Paulo Salim Maluf, who has served as mayor of this city and governor of Sao Paulo State, responded by suggesting that Mrs. Pitta was crazy, saying that ''more than the spotlight, what she deserves is pity and medical treatment.'' It was Mr. Maluf, now once again a candidate for mayor, who plucked Mr. Pitta (pronounced PEET-uh), then his financial secretary, from obscurity four years ago and single-handedly engineered his election.</p>
        <p>''I take responsibility for him,'' Mr. Maluf told voters then. ''If Pitta doesn't turn out to be a good mayor you shouldn't ever vote for me again.''</p>
        <p>Few others in this business and financial center of 10.5 million people seemed startled by Mrs. Pitta's accusations. Sao Paulo has a tradition of political corruption that dates back decades, and it was here that the expression ''rouba mas faz,'' which loosely translated means ''he steals, but he gets things done,'' was applied to Adhemar de Barros, political boss of Sao Paulo city and state from the end of World War II until the mid-1960's.</p>
        <p>But because Sao Paulo is so much more prosperous today, the sums mentioned in the current scandal are breathtaking. If all of the accusations that have surfaced are true, and polls show the overwhelming majority of the population believes they are, several billion dollars have been siphoned off or paid in bribes and kickbacks in recent years.</p>
        <p>''Corruption here is dynastic,'' said Jose Carlos Meihy, a professor at the University of Sao Paulo who specializes in local history. ''This is not an isolated instance, but because Sao Paulo is the showcase of Brazil and public works projects are so large and numerous, it leads to trafficking of influence on a scale that makes American corruption look like peanuts.''</p>
        <p>As a result, the crisis here has demoralized the entire nation. ''Although corrupt practices are becoming public in this alarming quantity because the state is reforming itself, the impression people have is exactly the opposite, of degeneracy,'' the president of Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, said in a newspaper interview.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cardoso may be correct in arguing that the political culture here has been transformed. Sao Paulo residents today seem less tolerant of corruption than were earlier generations, and prosecutors all over Brazil, armed with the expanded powers given them by the 1988 Constitution, have been more energetic than their predecessors in pursuing corrupt officials.</p>
        <p>''Just because this kind of thing has always gone on doesn't mean it should be allowed to continue,'' said Antenor Ferreira da Silva, who runs a fruit stand at a local market. ''I don't care what her motives are, Dona Nicea has done a service for the whole country by exposing this sea of slime.''</p>
        <p>That dissatisfaction has been worsened by an urban crisis here in which street crime and police violence are both increasing and public services are decaying. ''The real problem may be that this bunch has been stealing and not getting things done,'' said Elio Gaspari, a political commentator here whose column is syndicated in several national newspapers.</p>
        <p>The largest kickbacks and bribes appear to have been paid to officials and contractors on big public works projects like tunnels, highways and government buildings, but as the investigations have deepened, few areas of activity appear to have been immune.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Pitta has said that municipal hospitals were forced to buy medicine at inflated prices, that one of Mr. Maluf's sons had pocketed parking revenues and that she herself was part of a Maluf family scheme that diverted money from a school lunch program. The Maluf family denies all the accusations.</p>
        <p>Just before he was shot to death a few weeks ago, the president of the street vendors association said that elected officials had demanded and received payoffs from his group's members.</p>
        <p>''Somebody was trying to burn the archives,'' said the prosecutor in charge of that investigation when asked to explain the killing.</p>
        <p>The irregularities may even have extended to the United States. Federal authorities in New York are examining evidence that American companies may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by making payoffs to officials here in return for the right to lay fiber optic cable. A separate investigation in Miami is looking into money-laundering activities in which some of the same figures accused of corruption here have been implicated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pitta has dismissed all the accusations of corruption as false, saying that he is the victim of a political vendetta. He is not only the city's first black mayor but the first of humble origins to hold the office, and as he puts it, he has offended the powerful interests that have traditionally controlled the city and state.</p>
        <p>''From what is being said, you would think that this is the only case of corruption in all of Brazil,'' he said in an interview in his office at the Palace of Industry. ''But the truth is that we are combating corruption to an extent that has never been seen before, more than the state or even the federal government.''</p>
        <p>As for his wife's accusations, Mr. Pitta discounted reports that she wanted to get back at him because she suspected him of unfaithfulness after he was seen escorting another woman in Paris. He said ''her motive is vengeance and frustration at not being able to rule the city of Sao Paulo'' and not resentment of the divorce papers he filed several months ago.</p>
        <p>''She has a hunger for power and authority, but I would not let her interfere in matters of government,'' he said. ''When she saw I would not permit that, she turned against me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pitta fended off an impeachment challenge last year, but his wife says he did so only by bribing city council members, and now he faces another process seeking his dismissal.</p>
        <p>Most political analysts here, though, doubt that his opponents will obtain the two-thirds majority they need to remove him from office before a successor is elected in October, even though anyone voting with the mayor is likely to incur the wrath of voters.</p>
        <p>''The city council members themselves are deeply involved in all of this,'' said Dr. Meihy, the professor. ''But they would prefer not to be re-elected than to be proven to have been thieves themselves.''</p>
