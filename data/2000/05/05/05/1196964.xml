      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Two Democratic senators today criticized Vice President Al Gore's approach to Social Security, saying his plan would make the retirement system dependent on general tax revenue.</p>
        <p>The senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, spoke as they joined with Senator John McCain of Arizona, the recent Republican presidential candidate, to propose a bipartisan Congressional commission to plan a comprehensive overhaul of the Social Security system.</p>
        <p>The Democrats' remarks were not surprising. Both Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Kerrey supported former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey in the Democratic primaries. And both have long differed with their party and favored an effort to overhaul the retirement system that includes individual investment accounts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerrey recently met to discuss Social Security with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the expected Republican presidential nomineee.</p>
        <p>But the trio's push for a commission showed how the heated Social Security debate in the presidential race is reaching Capitol Hill and highlighting existing splits in the Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>Right after the three senators spoke, two other Democratic senators, Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota and Charles E. Schumer of New York, held their own news conference to criticize Mr. Bush's interest in including individual investment accounts as an element of overhauling Social Security.</p>
        <p>''To take a portion of the Social Security system and move it into private accounts, and subject it to substantial risk, I think is moving in exactly the wrong direction,'' Mr. Dorgan said.</p>
        <p>Social Security has long collected more in payroll taxes than it has paid out in benefits. But that is projected to start changing in 2015, when the baby boomers begin to retire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush advocate sharply different approaches to Social Security.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has put paying down the $3.5 trillion national debt at the center of his economic agenda. That would reduce the federal government's interest payments. He proposes to keep Social Security solvent through 2050 by allocating the interest savings to the retirement system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is to speak next week on Social Security and include a call for putting some portion of payroll taxes into private accounts. Under this approach, part of the retirement benefit would be guaranteed and part would fluctuate with individual investment decisions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Kerrey were drawn into spelling out their differences with their party's presumptive presidential nominee by reporters. Mr. Moynihan branded the word ''privatization'' a ''scare word,'' and he and Mr. Kerrey said Mr. Gore's approach would in essence change the very nature of the retirement program.</p>
        <p>''The American people have to decide,'' Senator Kerrey said, ''do you want to convert Social Security from a program that's been funded by the payroll tax into a program that's going to be funded increasingly with income taxes?''</p>
        <p>Asked about the commission today, Mr. Gore dismissed the idea, saying: ''These commissions are in the eye of the beholder. I disagree with them, and agree instead with the great majority of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and the House who are not for privatization of Social Security.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, campaigning in California, praised the three senators. ''I appreciate so very much the tone of their press conference,'' he said. ''This shouldn't be a partisan issue.''</p>
        <p>The commission proposed by the senators would report in time for a vote in Congress next year. By then, Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Moynihan will have retired from the Senate.</p>
