        <p>The GCI Group is acquiring the business of Russell-Welsh Inc. in San Mateo, Calif., a communications agency specializing in public relations and investor relations for biotechnology, life science and medical device companies like Neurobiological Technologies and Organogenesis. Terms were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>Russell-Welch accounts and some employees will be absorbed into the GCI Healthcare practice at the GCI office in San Francisco. Katharine Russell, 52, president at Russell-Welch, will serve as a senior counselor to GCI; she and the other Russell-Welch employees plan to start a consumer-oriented dot-com, to be based in what has been the agency's San Mateo office.
