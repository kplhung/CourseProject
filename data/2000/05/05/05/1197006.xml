        <p>Recuperating from a painfully sprained left ankle and arch, Tim Hardaway said today he wants to play a lot on Sunday, when the Miami Heat opens a four-of-seven-game playoff series against the Knicks, or not at all.</p>
        <p>''If I go 20-25 minutes, I think it would be worthwhile for me to play,'' Hardaway, the veteran point guard, said after the team's morning practice at Palm Beach Community College's Boca Raton gymnasium. ''If I can only go 15, 12 minutes, I don't think it would be that important. I wouldn't be able to help the team anyway. That's just a light jog.''</p>

        <p>Recuperating from a painfully sprained left ankle and arch, Tim Hardaway said today he wants to play a lot on Sunday, when the Miami Heat opens a four-of-seven-game playoff series against the Knicks, or not at all.</p>
        <p>''If I go 20-25 minutes, I think it would be worthwhile for me to play,'' Hardaway, the veteran point guard, said after the team's morning practice at Palm Beach Community College's Boca Raton gymnasium. ''If I can only go 15, 12 minutes, I don't think it would be that important. I wouldn't be able to help the team anyway. That's just a light jog.''</p>
        <p>Hardaway, who hasn't played since injuring his ankle on April 16 against Orlando, said the foot ''feels good,'' then added there still is pain. He has reconciled in his mind that if he plays, it will be with pain.</p>
        <p>He planned to participate in a closed team scrimmage tonight.</p>
        <p>Two of Hardaway's teammates who did not want to speak for attribution said they expected him to play on Sunday. So does power forward P. J. Brown.</p>
        <p>''I feel good,'' Brown said of Hardaway's prospects for Game 1. ''He's a big part of this team. The sooner he comes back, the better.''</p>
        <p>Hardaway's replacement would be the rookie Anthony Carter. Heat Coach Pat Riley, asked if he would be better off with a healthy Carter than an injured Hardaway, gave a succinct answer: ''No.''</p>
        <p>Asked if the Heat would miss Hardaway's passion for winning most, Riley paused a moment. ''Tim's a great, great player,'' he finally said. ''That's what anybody would miss. That's what we'd miss if he's not 100 percent.''</p>
        <p>''Tim's experience is so irreplaceable,'' said Alonzo Mourning. ''I told him all year, 'Don't you get hurt on me.' But we don't want to rush him back. He's trying to do some things, and he could hurt himself even more. We can beat the Knicks with Tim or without him.''</p>
        <p>Hardaway is acutely aware that  even though his performance was markedly hindered by an injured knee in last season's playoff loss to the Knicks, he faced the brunt of the criticism afterward.</p>
        <p>''If I play, hopefully I'll be at full strength,'' he said today. ''If that happens, we don't have to worry about all this other stuff.''</p>
