        <p>The New Yorker's 75th anniversary festival is this weekend, and all the proper nouns will be there: Julian Barnes, Edna O'Brien, Richard Ford, Alice Munro, Cynthia Ozick, Stephen King, Frances FitzGerald, Calvin Trillin, Joe Klein, John Lahr, V. S. Naipaul, Roger Angell, Roz Chast. But what about the most prolific writer in New Yorker history, the author of countless Talk of the Town pieces, the loyal, royal ''we''? Why wasn't ''we'' invited?</p>
        <p>Fearing foul play, we resolve to see what has happened. We sense that ''we,'' the first person plural pronoun, is no longer welcome at the offices of The New Yorker. We wonder what ''we'' did wrong.</p>
        <p>One writer (Tony Hiss) who knew the pronoun well tries to derail our inquiry by saying that ''we'' was never all that controversial. Another writer (Lillian Ross) tells us, ''We just got tired of it.'' A third (Ian Frazier) says he misses the anonymous old pronoun. A fourth (Susan Orlean) says ''we'' was ''like a weird food or taste that you don't like'' at first, ''and then you do.'' An editor we know (Charles McGrath) tells us that he always hated ''we'' and openly plotted against it in the 1980's and 90's. It was, he tells us twinklingly, so ''twee.''</p>
        <p>We, who can barely remember when ''we'' was twee, are befuddled by the strange and varied outpouring. We decide we had better do some digging ourselves. We arrive at The New Yorker at 5 o'clock on a Tuesday evening. We get our security sticker that lets us into the Conde Nast building and look for a fabric surface that will not be destroyed by the sticker. It is our pants. The offices are eerily quiet. We see Jeffrey Toobin in the hall. We recognize him from television.</p>
        <p>A nice woman from P.R. gives us a stack of New Yorkers and a list of the names of the writers who have hidden behind ''we'' over the years. She also gives us a Coke. We are surprised to learn that the first Talk of the Town in the first issue, Feb. 21, 1925, was signed, in script, by a character named Van Bibber III. The anonymous ''we'' did not appear until Aug. 15, 1925, and in fact it was not so anonymous. There was a tag line: ''The New Yorkers.''</p>
        <p>The pronoun's rise to prominence was dizzying. By 1929 it had the run of the magazine. It crept into a signed review of an exhibition of Albert Pinkham Ryder's paintings and into a signed column called the Wayward Press. David Remnick, the current editor of The New Yorker, tells us that back then the whole magazine sounded like the Talk of the Town.</p>
        <p>Who was ''we''? Just a pronoun, some say. Others disagree. ''We,'' Mr. Remnick recalls, was ''urbane yet slightly innocent, an intelligent but overwhelmed man.'' And ''we'' was, he underscored, ''almost always a man.''</p>
        <p>In the days of Harold Ross's New Yorker, ''we'' was the voice of E. B. White and James Thurber. ''We'' was a man of the people and a man about town, a gentle contrarian. When the stock market crashed in 1929, the pronoun, though alert to the nation's pain, couldn't help being amused ''to see a fat land quivering in paunchy fright.''</p>
        <p>The pronoun wrote sardonically about ''a Morgan,'' ''President Hoover'' and Arthur Brisbane, calling them ''The great comforters.'' The crash, the anonymous ''we'' said, ''verified our suspicion that our wise and talky friends hadn't known for months what they were talking about when they were discussing stocks.''</p>
        <p>In the 1920's and 30's, we think, ''we'' was enormously likable. But we begin to feel queasy upon reaching the wartime jottings of the anonymous pronoun. While Janet Flanner was profiling Hitler and Philip Hamburger was reporting from Europe and John Hersey was preparing ''Hiroshima,'' ''we'' was back home being arch.</p>
        <p>Take, for example, the magazine dated June 16, 1945, in which we see a ''Desolation Note'' that does not look quite desolate enough to us: ''The Minister of Reconstruction in the present Italian government is Signor Ruin.'' Ha ha. In August 1945 there is a ''newsbreak,'' a quotation from the news, about Hitler's family: ''Hitler's half-brother . . . is considered a kind of black sheep of the family.'' Then the editors quip, ''Must be quite a scalawag.'' Ha ha.</p>
        <p>We wonder long and hard why ''we'' was joking about the war in 1945. We sip our Coke. We are not at all surprised to see that by the 1940's the power and privileges of the first-person-plural pronoun have been clipped. ''We'' no longer has poaching rights throughout the magazine.</p>
        <p>We think it might have something to do with the airs that ''we'' is beginning to put on. Over time ''we'' changed. A friend (Mr. McGrath, the former deputy editor of The New Yorker and now the editor of The New York Times Book Review) tells us, '' 'We' was no longer just a pronoun. 'We' had a history. We was a character with a wife, with an apartment, with appurtenances.'' ''We,'' he tells us, seemed to think he was Eustace Tilley, the fop with the monocle at the top of Talk and on the cover of the magazine once a year. And Eustace Tilley, Mr. Remnick reminds us, was supposed to be a joke.</p>
        <p>In the 1950's the gent around town busied himself with genteel amusements. ''We,'' in the person of John Updike, ''decided to plot a course from the Empire State Building to Rockefeller Center that would involve no contact with Fifth or Sixth Avenue.'' Joseph Mitchell, writing as ''we,'' went to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden to watch old men dozing and young mothers minding their babies.</p>
        <p>Not everyone loved writing for the great anonymous ''we.'' It was ''awkward,'' says Roger Angell, a writer for The New Yorker. He recalls that even William Shawn, the editor of the magazine from 1952 to 1987, complained about it. Writers, who still had to pay ''we'' lip service, found ways to avoid its voice: ''A friend writes,'' ''Our Man Stanley tells us,'' ''the Long-Winded Lady says,'' ''We got in touch with E. M. Frimbo, who is regarded as the most widely traveled train fan in the country.''</p>
        <p>E. M. Frimbo (Rogers E. M. Whitaker), Our Man Stanley (Mr. Hamburger) and the Long-Winded Lady (Maeve Brennan) could go where they pleased. But ''we'' was a New Yorker first, and his tastes were limited. When Mark Singer tried to write about ''we'' buying a box of Junior Mints at the movies, he was told in no uncertain terms that ''we'' does not buy Junior Mints.</p>
        <p>The contortions multiplied in the 1960's. When the Beatles came to town, ''we'' couldn't or didn't want to go. He sent ''Our Man Stanley.'' And Stanley, who said he was ''laid up,'' passed the assignment to his ''nephew'': ''Have pressed into service teenage nephew, Hiram.'' Hiram, who was in fact Mr. Hiss, a writer for the magazine, filed the report and sent it in. All ''we'' did was acquire it and slap his name on it. It begins: ''A bulky manuscript in a bold cursive hand appeared on our desk the other morning.''</p>
        <p>Nov. 30, 1963, was a watershed date for ''we.'' That was when E. B. White, the consummate stylist, writing in Notes and Comment about the death of John F.Kennedy, found himself uneasily poised between ''one'' and ''we.'' He wrote: ''The Death of a President enters the house and becomes a death in the family. . . . Tritely one remembers the precise spot on which one stood, resisting acceptance and grief. For us it was a patch of crowded sidewalk.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Angell, whose mother was Katherine S. White, the New Yorker editor who married E. B. White, tries to explain the literary tension for us. In the beginning, Mr. Angell says, '' 'we' was not meant to suggest a consensus; it was a personal 'we.' '' But that ''we'' was beginning to melt.</p>
        <p>Nothing tested the limits of ''we'' more than the Vietnam War. That is when ''the cozy 'we' disappeared,'' Mr. Angell says. Reading Notes and Comment of Nov. 11, 1972, we see that he is right. We can almost watch the ''cozy we'' on its way out and the ''national we'' walking in. The piece, written by Jonathan Schell, begins with a personal ''we'': ''Last week, we had a letter from a friend of ours, who, like so many other people, has been kept in something like low spirits for almost a decade by the war in Vietnam.'' But it ends with a national ''we'': ''We entered the war deceived and fought it for a decade under a series of delusions. We should at least enter the peace with our eyes open.''</p>
        <p>''Things changed,'' says Mr. Frazier, a writer for The New Yorker, ''but exactly how, I couldn't tell you.'' And ''we'' was still hanging around impotently, as if waiting for punishment.</p>
        <p>In 1979 one writer for the magazine, Veronica Geng, turned ''we'' into a kind of secretary for Allen Ginsberg and Kenneth Koch, who were making up ''collaborative spontaneous poems'' at St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery. This is how the poem began:</p>
        <p>K. (light boyish voice): Snowmen perpetuate</p>
        <p>G. (deep boyish voice): Liquid Meltability</p>
        <p>K.: Without stopping</p>
        <p>G.: Winter winter</p>
        <p>K: Summer autumn</p>
        <p>And what was ''we'' doing? ''We transcribed some of the spontaneity.''</p>
        <p>That same year the writer Jamaica Kincaid let a Sting fan bully ''we'' out of the picture entirely: '' 'Sting,' said the pretty girl, 'Sting, Sting, Sting. . . . Sting is what I really like about Rock and Roll.' ''</p>
        <p>The me generation waged a vicious war on ''we.'' Even people who swear they adored the ''we'' carried out not-so-subtle subterfuge and open attacks. ''I loved it; I loved the anonymity'' of 'we,' '' Mr. Frazier says. ''I loved to try to invest the voice. I loved to say, 'We picked up our hat.' '' But ''everybody rebelled against anonymity,'' he says, because everybody had traded his fame for it. He confessed to having written a Talk of the Town item in which he put his name in 47 times. He explained, ''I felt owed.''</p>
        <p>In the 1980's ''you'' became a violent tool in the overthrow of ''we.'' Mr. Frazier used a virile ''you'': ''Monster Trucks make a noise that lifts you up by the roof of your mouth.'' George W. S. Trow threw a few ''yous,'' too: ''You are standing on the corner; things are dirty or not, unbearably hot or not; and you look up and, just at the level above where you had been looking before, there is a nail salon. Try it. Go outside. Then look up. Not all the way up. We're not talking about the sky here.''</p>
        <p>By the 90's ''there was little left that was anonymous,'' Mr. Hiss says. So when Tina Brown began the policy of revealing the authors behind the ''we,'' she was only carrying on the work of those who had come before.</p>
        <p>In the end ''we'' didn't die an easy death. We think ''we'' was murdered. The date was May 25, 1998, right after Frank Sinatra died. That day there were eight Talk of the Town pieces on Sinatra and one on the death of Pol Pot. Phyllis Cerf Wagner did the deed quickly with a few murderous sentences: ''Frank used to come in June and stay with us in the house that my husband, Bennett -- the publisher Bennett Cerf -- and I had in Mount Kisco,'' she writes, ''and we called him 'our summer boarder.' '' Thus the celebrity ''we'' killed off the anonymous ''we'' in Westchester County. It hit us like a ton of bricks.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, Mr. Remnick says, nobody asks about ''we.'' It is a voice of the past. Ms. Ross, who has written for The New Yorker for 55 years, says, '' 'We' doesn't make any difference to me.'' Its time has come and gone. But we suspect that there are plenty of New Yorkers who still remember the way ''we'' was.</p>
