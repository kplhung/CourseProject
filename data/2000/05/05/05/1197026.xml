        <p>As talks between Telefonica of Spain and Royal KPN of the Netherlands on a possible merger continued, the Spanish government called today for the Dutch government to reduce its stake in Royal KPN.</p>
        <p>Both companies are former state-owned phone monopolies. While shares in both are now traded publicly, the Spanish and Dutch governments still control major stakes.</p>
        <p>Telefonica's board met today to consider its options, including a full merger of operations with Royal KPN. Executives close to the talks said that Telefonica was considering paying about $54 billion for the Dutch concern. The meeting adjourned late today without a decision and will resume on Friday.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Spain's finance minister, Rodrigo Rato Figaredo, wrote his Dutch counterpart, Gerrit Zalm, saying, ''In order for a deal to be carried out, the Spanish government believes it would be necessary for the Dutch government to abandon its position as a leading shareholder in the company in an irreversible and immediate manner.'' The Netherlands controls a 43 percent stake in KPN. Spain has the right to block a merger or any one company from acquiring more than 10 percent of Telefonica.</p>
