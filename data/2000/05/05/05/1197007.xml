        <p>For more than a century, Mississippians have either cursed or honored the Confederate symbol in the corner of their state flag as a blazing reminder of the state's secessionist past. But no one bothered to question whether the flag was, in fact, the real state flag.</p>
        <p>Until, that is, the Mississippi Supreme Court found something rather surprising in a dusty legislative record. In an opinion issued today that rocked the statehouse and could lead to another epic Southern battle over symbolism, the court ruled that the current flag was not the official state flag.</p>
        <p>In fact, the court said, because of a legal technicality, the state has had no flag for 94 years.</p>
        <p>Several black legislators -- joined by Mike Moore, the state attorney general -- said the ruling provided a good opportunity to create a commission to design a flag free of any divisive symbols. But an equally vocal group of white legislators said the current flag should simply be adopted by the Legislature. A spokeswoman for Gov. Ronnie Musgrove said the governor, a Democrat, would announce a plan of action on Friday.</p>
        <p>Today's ruling stemmed from a lawsuit filed more than seven years ago by the state N.A.A.C.P. and a group of black residents, arguing that the Confederate symbol on the flag violated the equal-protection provisions of the state Constitution. The lawsuit had been dismissed and revived several times, and the state Supreme Court agreed to hear it last year, just as the issue began to heat up again because of a more publicized Confederate flag debate in South Carolina.</p>
        <p>In its decision today, the court essentially ruled against the N.A.A.C.P., saying the flag violated no provisions of the Constitution. But then the court went a step beyond any of the arguments that had been made for or against the flag. The justices said they had discovered that during a codification of all state laws in 1906 all laws before that date had been repealed unless they were specifically put into the new code of laws. The flag with its Confederate symbol had been designated in 1894, but no one remembered to put it into the post-1906 laws.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore, who is white and whose office had filed a brief arguing that the flag was constitutional, called today for a commission to design a new flag.</p>
        <p>''Maybe we can come out of this with a flag that everyone can agree on,'' Mr. Moore, a Democrat, said. ''We don't need the kind of ugly debates that other states have had. How about a magnolia tree?''</p>
        <p>Actually, the flag that flew over the state during the Civil War had a magnolia tree, with a single white star in the left corner.</p>
        <p>The Legislature adjourned for the year today and will not return until January, except for a special session the governor may call this summer to discuss economic issues. Several white legislators made it clear that whenever the issue came up, they would not support any commission to redesign the flag.</p>
        <p>''It's like a common-law marriage,'' said Representative Keith Montgomery, a Republican from Clinton, a suburb of Jackson. ''If we've flown it for 94 years, it is our flag, and it should continue to be our flag. If anyone tries to redesign it, it's not going to go quietly into the night.''</p>
