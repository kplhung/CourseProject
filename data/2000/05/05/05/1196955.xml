        <p>A rash of recent gambling-related scandals involving athletes from prestigious universities has cast suspicion on college sports. So has a widely reported survey of college football and basketball referees in which 40 percent said they bet on sports and 2 percent said they knew other referees who had made questionable calls with the intent of influencing scores.</p>
        <p>In a 1999 study conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan, 1 in 20 male college athletes said they had provided inside information for gambling purposes, bet on games in which they had played or accepted money for performing poorly. If this study is accurate, that means that four or five players on every college football team in America could be influenced by gambling pressures.</p>

        <p>A rash of recent gambling-related scandals involving athletes from prestigious universities has cast suspicion on college sports. So has a widely reported survey of college football and basketball referees in which 40 percent said they bet on sports and 2 percent said they knew other referees who had made questionable calls with the intent of influencing scores.</p>
        <p>In a 1999 study conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan, 1 in 20 male college athletes said they had provided inside information for gambling purposes, bet on games in which they had played or accepted money for performing poorly. If this study is accurate, that means that four or five players on every college football team in America could be influenced by gambling pressures.</p>
        <p>This infection threatens to undermine colleges, disillusion fans, and damage the careers and the integrity of some of our most promising young people. That is why, during the deliberations of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, I recommended a complete ban on gambling on collegiate and amateur sports. That recommendation, supported by a majority of my fellow commissioners of all political stripes, became the basis for legislation that is likely to come up for a vote next week in the Senate.</p>
        <p>Right now, gambling on college sports is legal only in Nevada. And even Nevada apparently recognizes the threat this gambling poses, since it prohibits betting on games involving Nevada schools.</p>
        <p>The legislation in Congress has strong support from the National Collegiate Athletic Association, university presidents, athletic directors and dozens of prominent coaches. It also has backing from many athletes, who realize the temptations and dangers betting brings to amateur sports.</p>
        <p>One of those, former Notre Dame place kicker Kevin Pendergast, found himself at the center of one of Northwestern's two recent gambling scandals and spent two months in prison. ''Without the option of betting money in Nevada,'' Mr. Pendergast said at a news conference when the congressional legislation was announced, ''the Northwestern basketball point-shaving scandal would not have occurred.''</p>
        <p>Most major Nevada casinos have designated areas where gamblers place bets on college and professional games. The overall revenues from sports gambling are minuscule compared with those from other forms of gambling. Events like the Final Four college basketball championships and the football bowl games, however, attract hordes of gamblers to the casinos.</p>
        <p>A vote to ban gambling on amateur sports should be, in sports terminology, a blowout. But don't bet on it. The proponents of gambling are making a states' rights argument, saying Congress shouldn't interfere with the Nevada law, and they are pushing it to political leaders while they continue making millions of dollars in campaign contributions every year to both parties and individual candidates.</p>
        <p>We must not simply accept the unseemly spectacle of Nevada casino operators raking in millions of dollars a year from what used to be the wholesome competition of 18- and 19-year-olds. If Congress caves in to the gambling moguls, more scandals will inevitably erupt, and each one will tarnish collegiate athletics a little more.</p>
