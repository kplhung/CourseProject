        <p>The dreary ''Into My Heart'' is so willfully naive that one of its heroes picks up a Manhattan waitress -- played by the absurdly beautiful Claire Forlani, who breaks a new series of hearts whenever she bats her lush eyelashes -- the first time he lays eyes on her. Or in this case, eye: Adam (Jake Weber) lost an eye when he was 7, the fault of his best friend, Ben (Rob Morrow), as they played with bottle rockets. And that incident damaged Ben more than it did Adam. ''He's still carrying that around,'' Adam says, amazed. Adam is constantly amazed, as anyone lucky enough to get Nina (Ms. Forlani) should be.</p>
        <p>The movie feels as inexorable as a Paul Simon song or a John Cheever short story, and it's glazed with the spare heartbreak of Cheever. When Ben learns that his dad is having an affair and tells Adam, Adam is shocked, but then again he's easily shocked; all of his adult life is about his being symbolically kicked out of Eden.</p>

        <p>The dreary ''Into My Heart'' is so willfully naive that one of its heroes picks up a Manhattan waitress -- played by the absurdly beautiful Claire Forlani, who breaks a new series of hearts whenever she bats her lush eyelashes -- the first time he lays eyes on her. Or in this case, eye: Adam (Jake Weber) lost an eye when he was 7, the fault of his best friend, Ben (Rob Morrow), as they played with bottle rockets. And that incident damaged Ben more than it did Adam. ''He's still carrying that around,'' Adam says, amazed. Adam is constantly amazed, as anyone lucky enough to get Nina (Ms. Forlani) should be.</p>
        <p>The movie feels as inexorable as a Paul Simon song or a John Cheever short story, and it's glazed with the spare heartbreak of Cheever. When Ben learns that his dad is having an affair and tells Adam, Adam is shocked, but then again he's easily shocked; all of his adult life is about his being symbolically kicked out of Eden.</p>
        <p>''Into My Heart'' may have been on the shelf for a while. Mr. Morrow is not a bad actor, though this movie wasn't made long enough ago for him to be credible as a graduate student, which his character is for the early portion of the film. Ben is the cynic who finds romance much too late. He doesn't believe in anything, a reflex to shield himself from pain -- a conceit, really.</p>
        <p>Despite the eye patch he wears, Adam has no emotional scar tissue. He was a virgin until he met Nina. Mr. Weber has the tougher role to play; he's the guy who's too good for this world, the brilliant but doomed innocent who has to be sacrificed, and he pulls something off. Mr. Weber has an insolent murmur; the movie itself seems to lean in to pay attention to what he says. (Mr. Morrow lowers his voice to keep up.)</p>
        <p>An actor of quiet intensity, Mr. Weber uses his voice well and plays Adam as happy and oblivious; he's too lost in his own reveries to come off as a victim. Mr. Weber and Mr. Morrow are good enough to play an exposition scene in a car, which was so obviously shot on the cheap that the hands of the crew members rocking the vehicle might as well be visible.</p>
        <p>The competitive aspect of their friendship gives them something to play. Ben's envy of Adam's serenity, his creative bent -- Adam becomes a writer while Ben is a successful but unhappy lawyer -- and his relationship with Nina is reminiscent of ''Quiz Show,'' in which Mr. Morrow's nose was also pressed against the glass.</p>
        <p>This is a movie of archetypes. Although its morose inevitability has been rendered with a great deal of care -- as much as possible, given the minuscule budget -- that doesn't alleviate the predictability. The film is austere and hollow, a valentine to melancholy. In its favor, the writers and directors, Anthony Stark and Sean Smith, handle their actors well, though budget constraints keep them from having too many actors to work with. The only other principal in the movie is Jayne Brook, who plays the woman Ben falls for and brings into the insular circle of friends.</p>
        <p>''Into My Heart'' descends into its spiral of betrayal as if that were a kind of purity. It's proud of its minor-key despair.</p>
