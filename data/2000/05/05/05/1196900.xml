        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>DEREK BAILEY, JAMES BLOOD ULMER, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. This show is as unlikely as it gets: Mr. Bailey's quiet, atonal, scrabbling guitar style against Mr. Ulmer's bright, slashing, bluesy figures. What will their meeting place sound like? But we've asked this question before in regard to Mr. Bailey, one of the gods of free improvisation, who has previously put himself beside electronic drum-and-bass, true-blue jazz drummers like Tony Williams and Paul Motian and John Zorn's goading saxophone honks. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30; tickets are $15 (Ben Ratliff).</p>

        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>DEREK BAILEY, JAMES BLOOD ULMER, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. This show is as unlikely as it gets: Mr. Bailey's quiet, atonal, scrabbling guitar style against Mr. Ulmer's bright, slashing, bluesy figures. What will their meeting place sound like?

Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30; tickets are $15 (Ben Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* ESZTER BALINT, DAVID POE, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. Eszter Balint might seem like a curiosity to veteran hipsters: the star of ''Stranger Than Paradise,'' the biggest cult film of 1984, resurfaces playing fractured cabaret. But the songs are actually funny, weird and wise, and Ms. Balint delivers them with great imagination. Her band includes Chris Cochrane, formerly of No Safety; Sebastian Steinberg, late of Soul Coughing; and Sim Cain, who has played with the Rollins Band. David Poe, a more conventional singer and songwriter, has a talent for mixing sensitivity and sharp wit. Sunday at 8 p.m.; admission is $10 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>GARY BARTZ QUARTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. After 30 years, the burning saxophonist Mr. Bartz still has something of an underground reputation; he is always the stealth candidate for a great night of music. It's largely because he hasn't had the wide exposure on records that he deserves, but records never tell the truth anyway. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 8, 10:30 and midnight, with a cover of $25; sets on Sunday night are at 7 and 9, with a cover of $18; $10 minimum all nights. (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* WALDEMAR BASTOS, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Waldemar Bastos, from Angola, pours his pearly tenor into songs filled with an exile's longing for the war-torn country he left behind. The songs are kin to Brazilian samba and Portuguese fado, and Mr. Bastos and his band's guitarists build lilting, glistening musical lattices in which melody and rhythm are inseparable. Tonight at 9 and 11; admission is $20 (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>DON CABALLERO, TURING MACHINE, Brownies, 169 Avenue A, at 11th Street, East Village, (212) 420-8392. Don Caballero, an instrumental band from Pittsburgh, headlines a double bill of instrumental rock. Its two guitars line up one dissonant, asymmetrical, aggressive guitar riff after another, or dissolve into planned noise, while the drums subdivide the time, clatter and splash. Turing Machine, which shares the bill, also knows its way around dissonances and odd meters. Sunday at 8:30 p.m.; admission is $10 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* DUETS ON THE HUDSON: MISHA MENGELBERG AND HAN BENNINK, STEVE LACY AND MAL WALDRON, Stanley H. Kaplan Penthouse, Rose Building, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center; (212) 721-6500. The last installment of Jazz at Lincoln Center's duet series can't really go wrong: both of these partnerships date way back, and the music of Thelonious Monk might haunt the evening in a perfectly unforced way. Mr. Bennink, a gifted drummer who pleases audiences with performance antics that resemble Mr. Hulot after a quart of coffee, has never played duets in this country with the pianist Misha Mengelberg, his calmer, Monk-influenced Dutch colleague, though they've played together since the 1960's. The soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy's connection with the pianist Mal Waldron goes back to a 1958 recording on which they played nothing but Monk tunes; since then they've frequently reconvened to parse and shine up tunes by Monk, Herbie Nichols, Tadd Dameron and others. The concerts are today and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $40 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* ''FIRE AT KEATON'S BAR AND GRILL,'' Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity, 157 Montague Street, at Clinton Street, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 858-2424. Characters have always been implicit in the protean instrumental music that the saxophonist Roy Nathanson writes for the Jazz Passengers: brawlers, lovers, conspirators, sirens, pranksters. In ''Fire at Keaton's Bar and Grill,'' he has given some of those characters lyrics and stories. The music embraces jazz, funk, torch songs and even a tango, with a 19-member ensemble including Elvis Costello, Deborah Harry of Blondie (as the bartender) and Richard Butler of the Psychedelic Furs. The multimedia show, with video images on the stage, is directed by John Jesurun. Tonight at 8 and 10:30; tomorrow at 8 p.m. Tickets: $30 and $35; sold out but returns may be available (Pareles).</p>
        <p>FIVESTYLE, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. This group of Chicago avant-rock luminaries sounds like a bunch of pals who got together to play a summer roof party and just kept going after the sangria ran out. Members of Tortoise, Wilco and Heroic Doses, along with the semi-legendary Lonesome Organist, have fun with the history of cheesy jazz. Tonight at 11; admission is $8 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* GHAZAL, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536. The improvisations of Persian and Indian classical music have common roots; they are based on modal scales, rhythmic cycles and traditional melodic contours, ideas that were carried on the Silk Road trade route, which  connected them. On two superb albums and in concert, this trio of two Indian musicians -- Shujaat Khan on sitar and Swapan Chaudhuri on tabla -- and an Iranian kamancheh (spike fiddle) player, Kayhan Kalhor, seek a common ground in music that can be meditative or dazzlingly virtuosic. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $26 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* JOHNNY GRIFFIN QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. The tenor saxophonist's yearly visits to the Vanguard are precious events: here is a musician who combines the most earthy, knowing humor with a serious, rigorous command of rhythm and harmony. A Chicagoan who sprouted in the 1950's, when a jazz musician had to have an individual sound or he was out of work, Mr. Griffin has lived in Europe for ages; you can feel his happiness when he's back on native ground. And he has kept an American band for these occasions, including the pianist Michael Weiss, a hard-driving, exciting bebop player. Sets through Sunday are at 9:30 p.m. and 11:30 p.m.; cover charge is $20; $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* DAVE HOLLAND, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. Mr. Holland, one of the best bassists playing jazz, keeps honing his vision of small-group music, with tight, light, clipped arrangements; his new CD, ''Prime Directive'' (ECM), includes the tenor saxophonist Chris Potter, the vibraphonist Steve Nelson and the trombonist Robin Eubanks. Music is today and tomorrow at 9 and 11 p.m.; cover charge is $30; $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>INDIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC, Synod Hall, Cathedral of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at West 112th Street.. Information: (718) 335-3465, (718) 809-4666, (212) 627-1076 or (212) 988-8934. In its home setting, Indian classical music stretches out unconstricted by Western attention spans or concert halls' union rules. This 12-hour concert will let the music meditate at leisure, though there will doubtless be stretches of blistering speed as well. The performers, in various combinations, include the singers Lakshmi Shankar and Mitali Banerjee Bhawmik; the sitarists Krishna Bhatt, K. V. Mahabala and Daisy Paradis; the sarangi (bowed lute) player Ramesh Mishra; the tabla drummers Swapan Chaudri, Samir Chatterjee, Narendra Budhakar and Ray Spiegel; the bansuri (bamboo flute) player Steve Gorn; and the harmonium player Gopal Rao Phadke. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. (to 8 a.m.); tickets are $25.50 to $100 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* ''INTUITIVE JAZZ: THE LENNIE TRISTANO LEGACY,'' TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, 199 Chambers Street, (212) 346-8510. Lennie Tristano's long, motoring single-note lines -- sparkling with songlike melody, coolly delivered and calmly cruising through the points where they should normally resolve -- had a deep impact, not only on a coterie of musicians in his own time (he died in 1978) but also on those who learned from his reissued records. This concert of music by and inspired by Tristano will be special, for it makes the appropriate generational links with superb musicians. It features Lee Konitz, the brilliant alto saxophonist who often played in Tristano's groups in the 1940's and 1950's, as well as Mark Turner, a tenor saxophonist in his 30's who has has taken Tristano rhythms and melodies and added a Coltrane-like sense of attack and harmony. The other musicians are special, too: they're members of the Jazz Composers Collective, a cooperative organization that has lately served as a stamp of quality, on the basis of a number of smart, shrewd records and performances. The band includes the bassist Ben Allison, the trumpeter Ron Horton, the pianist Frank Kimbrough, the saxophonist Michael Blake and the drummer Tony Moreno. It all happens tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $35 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>ILLINOIS JACQUET BIG BAND, Iridium, 48 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. Since the early 40's, when he started out with Lionel Hampton's band, Illinois Jacquet's saxophone playing has most resembled blown kisses and thrown bricks: he's one of the old-fashioned soft-at-heart players. His big band, which he has kept together against the odds for around 15 years, has the knockabout heft that used to be common in jazz. Sets are today through Sunday at 8:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.; there is a 12:15 show tomorrow; cover charge is $35; $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* KEITH JARRETT, GARY PEACOCK, JACK DeJOHNETTE, Carnegie Hall, 154 West 57th Street, (212) 247-7800. Because of health problems, the pianist Keith Jarrett has seriously cut down his performing regimen; this is his first appearance in Manhattan in five years. His highly sensitive touch, which became almost well known again last year on a new solo record that sold staggeringly well for jazz, can make large halls seem intimate, and for improvised communication this longstanding trio is about as good as it gets. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $28 to $65 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>JURASSIC 5, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. As the 1980's ended, East Coast groups like De La Soul and the Jungle Brothers came up with a leisurely, amiable, unslick form of hip-hop that keeps resurfacing, lately in Los Angeles, the home of the Jurassic 5. With four rappers and two disc jockeys, Jurassic 5 tops sparse, swinging riffs with boasts that casually aim for ''perfect verbal architecture.'' Sunday at 9 p.m.; admission is $16 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>KID KOALA, AMON TOBIN, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. Kid Koala is a turntablist, a disc jockey whose fast hands turn vinyl discs into sources of percussion and raw noise as well as ricocheting grooves. He tempers his scratching virtuosity with a sense of humor as he slices and dices everything from jazz albums to children's records, and he remembers that listeners like a groove. Amon Tobin builds atmospheric sound collages with locomotion at their core, whether they're ambling or strutting or sputtering or surging; he's one of the few disc jockeys who are not afraid to leave 4/4 time behind. Tomorrow at 10 p.m.; tickets are $15. The disk jockeys perform on Monday at 8 p.m. at the Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; tickets are $15 in advance, $20 on Monday (Pareles).</p>
        <p>LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO ELECTRIC LIGHT ORCHESTRA, Fez, downstairs at the Time Cafe, 380 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Oh, oh, oh, it's magic, as the master of warped nostalgia, Joe McGinty, leads his ensemble of bar-hopping stars through the visionary oeuvre of the Afro-wearing, synthesizer-wielding, falsetto-flinging orchestra leader Jeff Lynne. Learn to cringe all over again to the strains of ''Evil Woman.'' Today at 8 p.m., tomorrow at 7 and 10:30 p.m.; admission is $15 (Powers).</p>
        <p>PAT McGEE BAND, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. The Pat McGee Band is on the country end of the jam-band spectrum. Its benevolent, unhurried songs have the lilt of the early Doobie Brothers, topped with close-harmony vocals. Tomorrow at 9 p.m.; tickets are $16.50 in advance, $18 tomorrow (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* MOUSE ON MARS, TRANS AM, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Mouse on Mars, a German electronic duo, makes its synthesizers tick and whir, nibble and chirp, as ghosts of ska and cha-cha waft through the tunes. The music tickles the brain with a certain quizzical detachment. Trans Am plays progressive rock that dispenses with lyrics or vocals while it revives the peculiar structures and melodic detours of 1970's rock experimenters. Its pieces trace long, unpredictable arcs from delicacy to grandeur to noise. Tonight at 8; tickets are $15 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* MUZSIKAS WITH MARTA SEBASTYEN, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536. Muzsikas, from Hungary, is a band of former conservatory musicians who, 25 years ago, fell in love with their own traditional music: robustly bowed basses putting an oom-pah under darting, sighing violin lines. Marta Sebastyen sings with Muzsikas in a smoky voice tinged with melancholy; she has collaborated on various world-music projects, including the soundtrack of ''The English Patient.'' On its current album, Muzsikas re-examines Bartok compositions and the folk tunes he drew on, and for this concert the group is joined by a classical violinist, Alexander Balanescu, and two dancers. Tonight at 8; tickets are $26 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>SONORA PONCENA, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882. Sonora Poncena has been one of the cornerstones of Puerto Rican salsa since it was founded in 1954; it has been led since 1964 by the keyboardist Papo Lucca. His arrangements are at once transparent and propulsive, with pinpoint horns, percussion and keyboard behind ardent vocals; they have urged more than one generation of dancers into motion. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $35 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>LEE RANALDO, LEAH SINGER, Roulette, 228 West Broadway, at White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-8242. When he's not playing with Sonic Youth, Lee Ranaldo is fond of using tape loops and other devices that repeat, reflect and sustain his guitar tones. For this performance, Leah Singer will supply visual images and projections. Tomorrow at 9 p.m.; admission is $10 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* DEWEY REDMAN, JOE LOVANO, STEVE TURRE, CHARLES DAVIS, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. These four jazz vets -- two great tenor saxophonists, a trombonist and a baritone saxophonist -- are banding together for a two-night benefit for prostate cancer research. And the idea of a Redman-Lovano matchup -- gales of dark saxophone poetry and smoky-toned swing -- is sublime. Tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m.; tickets are $12 in advance, $14 the day of the show (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>THE REVEREND HORTON HEAT, HANK WILLIAMS III, AMAZING CROWNS, Roxy, 515 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-5156. By the end of this evening, your hair will have magically discharged a mound of styling grease; your khakis will have transformed into boot-cut dark denims; you'll have a switchblade in your back pocket and some tobacco in your cheek. That's how intensely country-punk this bill is. The Dallas-based Reverend is the long-ruling monarch of rockabilly madness. Hank III does his progenitors proud with his punk honky-tonkin'. The Crowns round it out with the kind of rowdy rock that gets them screaming in their native Boston area. Tonight at 7; admission is $15 (Powers).</p>
        <p>BEACHWOOD SPARKS, MOONEY SUZUKI, Mercury Lounge, 217 Houston Street, at Essex Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. You can't get more traditional in a rock club than this bill does. Mooney Suzuki plays letter-perfect 1960's-style garage rock, and its members have the bowl haircuts to prove it. Beachwood Sparks pays homage to its Los Angeles roots with a sound that blends the Byrds with a splash of the Beach Boys. Both outfits do very well by the legacies they have claimed. With Tom Gorman. Tomorrow at 9 p.m.; admission is $8 (Powers).</p>
        <p>STORM AND STRESS, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Ian Williams of Don Caballero plays guitar, Erich Ehm plays electric bass, and Kevin Shea plays ''free drums'' and percussion in this experimental rock band. Also on the bill is another trio, led by the drummer Jim Black and including the keyboardist Jamie Saft and the bassist Skuli Sverrrisson. Tonight at 10:30 and midnight; admission is $10 (Powers).</p>
        <p>SWEET HONEY IN THE ROCK, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street,  Newark, (888) 466-5722. As part of the center's Spanish Routes and Rhythms series, this glorious a cappella ensemble from Washington explores the links between the Latin and African worlds and how they have blended throughout American history. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; admission is $10 to $46 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* TAKE BACK THE DECKS: AN EVENING OF WOMEN IN UNDERGROUND MUSIC, Pier 63 (Hudson River at 23rd Street) and the Frying Pan, one pier north of Chelsea Piers (on the Hudson River, 12th Avenue and 23rd Street). Information: (212) 989-6363 or www.gURL.com. Women are still a small minority among dance-club disc jockeys and hip-hop producers and performers, but this marathon program intends to change the situation. Women will be in charge of turntables and microphones deep into the night. Tomorrow from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., there will be free workshops for fledgling disc jockeys, rappers and independent recording moguls by women who will be performing later. A documentary about women in hip-hop, ''Nobody Knows My Name,'' will also be shown. From 9 p.m. to midnight on Pier 63, there will be hip-hop from the rappers Apani B Fly Emcee and Jean Grae, and turntable virtuosity from Kuttin Kandi and DJ Shortee. Kandi's turntables will also back up the Anomolies, with five rappers and break dancers. Indoors on the Frying Pan, a party boat, the disc jockeys Anna, the Spinsters and Rekha will play hip-hop, techno and Indian-electronic hybrids. At midnight, music continues inside the Frying Pan with SuperJane, featuring DJ Colette and DJ Dayhota, doing a tag-team set of house music as Colette sings on top of the records she plays, followed by Kelli Hand, a disc jockey and producer from Detroit. An $8 donation is requested for the Frying Pan events after 9 p.m.; free before 9 p.m. (Pareles).</p>
        <p>LOS TIGRES DEL NORTE, Theater at Madison Square Garden, Seventh Avenue and 33rd Street, (212) 465-6741. Since the 1970's, Los Tigres del Norte have been one of Mexico's most popular groups playing norteno, the music known north of the border as Tex-Mex music. Updating an old tradition that carries news and history in songs, their corridos, cumbias, rancheras and boleros bounce through tales of border life all the way up to the Nafta era. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $38 to $63 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>WILD COLONIALS, Mercury Lounge, 217 Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. The Wild Colonials' folk-rock songs get a British accent from Angela McCluskey's tearful, Celtic-tinged voice and Paul Cantellon's violin. The songs are full of heartfelt emotional declarations that have endeared them to moviemakers; they've shown up on so many soundtracks that the band just released a full album of soundtrack material, ''Reel Life Vol. 1.'' Sunday at 9:30 p.m., with Brendan O'Shea opening; admission is $10 (Pareles).</p>
