        <p>More Hostages in Sierra Leone  The number of United Nations peacekeepers held hostage by rebels rose to at least 92 in the West African country of Sierra Leone, where a tense calm followed four days of escalating clashes between the peacekeepers and insurgent fighters.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Congo to Allow U.N. Forces  President Laurent Kabila watched as his foreign minister signed an agreement with the United Nations that the president had long resisted, one that opens the way for an international peacekeeping force for Congo. The Central African country has been embroiled in a war with half a dozen nations that has pitted Mr. Kabila's government against rebels backed by Uganda and Rwanda.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Maverick Elected in London  Londoners chose a maverick populist, Ken Livingstone, as their city's first elected mayor. Mr. Livingstone, who was ousted from the Labor Party, succeeded despite government efforts to block his candidacy.</p>

        <p>Lockerbie Residents Testify  Residents of the Scottish village took the stand in the trial of two Libyans accused of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988 and described a hellish scene; 11 of the 270 people killed were on the ground in Lockerbie.</p>
        <p>A3</p>
        <p>Fighting Along Lebanon Border  Attacks and retaliatory attacks over three days involving Israeli forces, their South Lebanese militia allies and Hezbollah guerrillas left one Israeli soldier dead and another wounded and at least two Lebanese women dead and several Lebanese civilians wounded.</p>

        <p>Court Finds Disputed Flag Is Not Official, After All  The Mississippi Supreme Court said an overlooked legal technicality had left the state without any official flag since 1906. Several black legislators, who oppose the current flag's incorporation of a Confederate design, pressed for creation of a commission to select a new flag. Some white lawmakers urged the Legislature to formally adopt the current flag.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>District Protest Effort Gains  Mayor Anthony A. Williams endorsed a grass roots movement to imprint ''Taxation Without Representation'' on District of Columbia license plates, to protest the fact that city residents pay $2 billion in annual federal taxes but have yet to obtain voting rights in Congress.</p>
        <p>A23</p>
        <p>Death Penalty to Be Sought  Prosecutors in Atlanta said they would seek the death penalty for Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, the Muslim cleric formerly known as H. Rap Brown, who is charged with murdering a sheriff's deputy in March.</p>
        <p>A18</p>
        <p>Vieques Protesters Removed  Federal agents peacefully took about 200 protesters from a naval bombing range on the Puerto Rican island. The protesters, who included two members of Congress, want the Navy to end bombing exercises and leave the island. None of the demonstrators were charged.</p>
        <p>A18</p>
        <p>Lessening Air Bags' Force  The government is expected to announce new standards for automobile air bags today, allowing less powerful bags that would reduce the risk to children and small adults.</p>
        <p>A18</p>
        <p>2 Democrats Fault a Gore Plan  Two Democratic senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, criticized Vice President Al Gore's approach to Social Security, saying his plan would make the system dependent on general tax revenue.</p>

        <p>Vatican Offers No Sign Of Cardinal's Successor  There were few clues as to whom Pope John Paul II would name to succeed Cardinal John O'Connor as archbishop. Church officials in the United States said the successor had been chosen but no announcement should be expected until after the funeral. A Vatican official said the pope was given a final list of recommendations after a Feb. 24 meeting of the Congregation of Bishops.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>On the first of five solemn days leading to a funeral on Monday, church officials scheduled daily Masses and public viewings of the cardinal's body at St. Patrick's Cathedral.</p>

        <p>Sentenced for Subway Killing  Andrew Goldstein was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for the murder Kendra Webdale, whom he pushed in front of a subway train in January 1999. Mr. Goldstein, 30, who has schizophrenia, blamed the attack on a ''psychotic incident.''</p>

        <p>Changing a Vote for Chancellor  Irving S. Hamer Jr., the Manhattan member of the city's Board of Education, made a bid to be named chancellor. In so doing, Dr. Hamer removed the majority vote -- his own -- for Harold O. Levy, the interim chancellor, and paralyzed a process that had seemed destined to result in Mr. Levy's selection.</p>

        <p>Putting Schools to the Test  The New York State Board of Regents voted to publicly grade every school in the state based on scores on the new statewide tests, rewarding or punishing schools according to where they rank.</p>

        <p>Praise for Charter Schools  President Clinton lauded charter schools on a visit to the first in the nation, in St. Paul, but criticized some state laws governing the independent public schools.</p>
