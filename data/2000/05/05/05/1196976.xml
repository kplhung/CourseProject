        <p>With one United Nations peacekeeping force under violent attack in Sierra Leone, the international organization moved ahead yesterday with plans to dispatch another to Congo.

        <p>Sierra Leone demonstrates the danger of sending a weak and inadequately trained peacekeeping force into a country where there is not yet a peace to keep. Rebels killed four Kenyan peacekeepers this week and took hostage at least 92 U.N. troops and civilians.

        <p>With one United Nations peacekeeping force under violent attack in Sierra Leone, the international organization moved ahead yesterday with plans to dispatch another to Congo. The juxtaposition clearly suggests a need to improve the planning and execution of such U.N. missions to ensure that peacekeeping forces do not become casualties in the conflicts they are supposed to help end.</p>
        <p>Sierra Leone demonstrates the danger of sending a weak and inadequately trained peacekeeping force into a country where there is not yet a peace to keep. Rebels killed four Kenyan peacekeepers this week and took hostage at least 92 U.N. troops and civilians. The U.N. must quickly reinforce the 8,700 peacekeepers already there and regain control of an unraveling mission.</p>
        <p>A year ago the Revolutionary United Front, the group that terrorized Sierra Leone throughout an eight-year civil war by severing the limbs of thousands of civilians, signed a peace accord with an elected government. But the rebels have flouted it ever since. In February the Security Council authorized an increase in the mission from 6,000 to 11,000 troops, but has not fully carried out the plan because of lagging troop contributions from member states. Washington can help by providing cargo aircraft to fly Jordanian, Bangladeshi and Indian troops into Sierra Leone as soon as they are ready.</p>
        <p>U.N. troops have responded to the recent rebel attacks by surrounding the home of the rebel leader Foday Sankoh in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown.  They should continue to do so. Mr. Sankoh may be induced to arrange release of the hostages, but he has failed to honor his pledge to disarm his forces and allow U.N. troops to move into rebel territory, where they might interfere with his lucrative diamond-smuggling operation. The peace agreement gave Mr. Sankoh immunity from prosecution for crimes committed during the war. It is now clear that Sierra Leone is unlikely to enjoy real peace until he and his confederates are held accountable for their crimes.</p>
        <p>The U.N.'s mistakes in Sierra Leone should not be repeated in Congo, which agreed yesterday to accept a U.N. force of 5,500 troops to monitor a tenuous cease-fire there. Richard Holbrooke, the chief American representative to the U.N., rightly noted this week that the U.N. ''can't turn away from crises like these.'' But an outside force should be called upon to maintain peace, not to make it. A mission of this kind is appropriate only when a realistic peace deal is respected by all sides and a cease-fire has been established. An international force must then be given the financial resources, manpower and disciplined command needed to protect itself and effectively carry out its mandate.</p>
