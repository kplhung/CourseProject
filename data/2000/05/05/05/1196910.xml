        <p>IT sounds like the setup for some bizarre avant-garde reality show: take a dozen or so actors, put them on a bus for four months and see what happens.</p>
        <p>This isn't ''The Real World,'' however. This is theater, Acting Company style.</p>
        <p>For nearly three decades the company has followed the deceptively simple strategy of finding good young actors, casting them in good old plays and taking them to small towns and cities from coast to coast.</p>
        <p>For those involved, it is a mission that requires not just a deep love for the stage but also a boundless appreciation for fast-food, sleep deprivation and hotels where the pillows haven't seen a mint since Eisenhower.</p>
        <p>''It's like acting as endurance test,'' said Christopher Jean, who has toured with the Acting Company for the last two years. ''If you're not a bohemian gypsy by nature, this is not the calling for you.''</p>
        <p>The company's latest batch of recruits recently covered more than 13,300 miles and hit some 50 cities with a three-show repertory, a January-to-May tour that ended at 8:37 p.m. on Monday, when the troupe's navy blue bus pulled into Manhattan carrying 13 of the happiest, most road-tested actors you've ever seen.</p>
        <p>''We talked about it, we did it,'' said a smiling Mia Barron, the troupe's resident gamin and owner of the group's most infectious laugh. ''And now it's done.''</p>
        <p>Well, not quite. Through May 13, the company is in residence at the Playhouse at St. Clement's on West 46th Street performing two of this season's productions: Richard Brinsley Sheridan's ''Rivals,'' directed by Nicholas Martin, and ''Macbeth,'' which has been given a modern gloss by the director Anne Justine D'Zmura.</p>
        <p>Founded in New York in 1972 by the director John Houseman and its producer, Margot Harley, the Acting Company grew out of two defining experiences in Houseman's life: his establishment, in 1937, of the legendary Mercury Theater with Orson Welles, and his tenure as the director of the drama division at the Juilliard School. As such, the company carries two equal burdens, being a populist platform for bringing theater to the masses and a hands-on training program for young actors.</p>
        <p>Since Houseman's death in 1988, Ms. Harley has carried on those missions, albeit with less federal and institutional support than in the early days. While the first tours, which featured alumni like Kevin Kline, Patti LuPone and Frances Conroy, may have had as many as six shows in rotation, today's schedule is more modest. Still, says Ms. Harley, the original intent is intact. ''It's still the same,'' she said. ''And probably more important now than it was then.''</p>
        <p>The company's stint at St. Clement's is merely this season's final act in an adventure that began on a cold day at the College of Staten Island -- the group's first show on Jan. 8 -- and took the troupe everywhere from Somerville, N.J., 36 miles west, to Anchorage, 3,352 miles northwest. (There was also a four-town tour in November.) The pace was often hectic: during a stint in February, for example, the company played six cities in seven days.</p>
        <p>Along the way the troupe has collected more road stories than Willie Nelson. There was the traffic jam outside Cerritos, Calif., that turned a two-hour ride into a six-hour crawl and transformed the preshow warm-up into a sprint. Then there was the morning performance in Philadelphia, where the teenage crowd screamed and cheered -- but only when Macbeth got medieval on someone. And there was Scottsdale, Ariz., where the company's children's production, an abridged version of ''The Merry Wives of Windsor,'' was canceled after that community's arbiters of taste decided it was simply too bawdy.</p>
        <p>''They said they hadn't been sent a copy of the script,'' said Jeff Swarthout, a company member.</p>
        <p>'What Day Is It?'</p>
        <p>There were also more general rigors of the road: boredom, loneliness, frustration, fatigue, Wal-Mart.</p>
        <p>''It's very tough being away from Stephanie, my girlfriend,'' said Matt Anderson, 24, the youngest member of the troupe. ''And my cat.''</p>
        <p>The whirl of cities and roadside hotels also caused a peculiar type of vertigo.</p>
        <p>''When people ask you what room you're in, you really have to take a moment,'' said Angela Pierce, who plays the female lead in ''The Rivals.'' ''1206? 6012? What day is it?''</p>
        <p>Postshow dining was a drama unto itself -- ''they don't serve late in Billings, Montana,'' said one actor -- a situation that led to the systematic consumption of untold tons of processed chicken, instaburgers, nacho plates and Buffalo wings. (As one might imagine, there was also an occasional drink.)</p>
        <p>And while the actors often performed twice a day, sometimes after traveling more than 500 miles between shows, the eight-person technical crew may have had an even tougher workload: unloading, assembling and taking down the sets for each performance. Between shows, the crew slept in a sleeper bus equipped with eight coffin-size bed chambers.</p>
        <p>''Anybody who spends that much time in the dark,'' said one techie, ''has to be a little bit twisted.''</p>
        <p>Still, for every annoyance, the actors cited plenty of bigger pleasures, not the least of which was a steady paycheck: $588 a week plus $80 a day toward food and lodging.</p>
        <p>The company also offered its members, all in their 20's and 30's and many fresh out of acting school, the golden opportunity to act in roles for which they might not otherwise have been cast. ''You get to play parts that you wouldn't get for 10 to 15 years,'' said Andrew McGinn, a 1998 Juilliard graduate who appeared as Macduff in ''Macbeth.'' Every actor, in fact, played at least one role in ''Macbeth'' and ''The Rivals,'' with a handful also doing duty in ''Merry Wives.''</p>
        <p>For many members, too, there was the undeniable thrill of traveling across wide swaths of the country that they had never seen or heard about. Here, too, every location came with a memory: the hot springs in Thermopolis, Wyo., where big, dead stuffed animals adorned the walls and the air smelled like sulfur, or that splendid tiki bar that the group discovered hidden behind the front desk in a hotel in Tecumseh, Mich.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most important, though, the actors said they found something else: an honest satisfaction with bringing theater to places that are not exactly flush with theater. Places, they said, like Pinedale, Wyo., or Lamoni, Iowa, where the arrival of performers from the big city is still greeted with small-town enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>''You have to admire people in this country who are insisting that theater come into their culture, so their kids aren't just seeing TV and movies,'' said Mr. Jean, who plays Macbeth and was, appropriately, a leader in the group. ''It makes the lack of sleep worth it.''</p>
        <p>In search of a taste of the touring life, this reporter spent last weekend on the road with the Acting Company during its final swing from Fairfax, Va., to Pittsburgh, and finally back to Manhattan.</p>
        <p>I found a remarkably amiable group of actors, eight men and five women whose long travels and time onstage together had bred a camaraderie rarely found among actors who merely ride the subway to work.</p>
        <p>Like all sagas, the story of the Acting Company begins and ends in a single locale: the bus.</p>
        <p>There are two buses, actually -- the sleeper for the techies and the actors' sit-up variety -- and a tractor-trailer to carry the troupe's three sets.</p>
        <p>The sleeper bus is critical because techies often have to strike a set after an evening performance (ending around 10), pack it up (usually done by midnight), drive hundreds of miles (1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m . . . ) and then wake up at 8 a.m. to assemble the set again.</p>
        <p>The actors' bus is less elaborate, a 50-seater stocked with sundries for the road (small cans of tuna, a box of Alpha-Bits cereal) and decorated with mementos from home (a photo of Mr. Swarthout's sister, a Chinese lantern sent by a friend of another actor). By the last leg of the tour, almost nobody even glanced out at  the passing landscape; they had apparently taken in all the freeway vistas they needed.</p>
        <p>The bus, emblazoned with the words ''Country Trails,'' was driven by a mysterious monosyllabic cowboy type (boots, hat, silver beard)  named Tim.</p>
        <p>''Tim's the strong, silent type,'' said Jonathan Uffelman, the group's wryest character. ''He's really the heart of this company.''</p>
        <p>At the back of the bus were a couple of narrow fold-up tables squeezed between two sets of facing seats, an area dubbed ''the living room'' that was the social center of the tour.</p>
        <p>''This is it,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''This is who we are.''</p>
        <p>It is here that the gossiping is done, the massages are given, and at the very end of the tour, the teary soliloquies are spoken. The first day I boarded, however, it was all about  putting over the best line.</p>
        <p>''Roy, where did you get those glasses?'' said Mr. Jean to Royden Mills, a leading man in ''Merry Wives.''</p>
        <p>''Do you like them?'' Mr. Mills asked.</p>
        <p>''Yeah,'' Mr. Jean said, his eyes smiling behind his own Gucci frames. ''They make you look like a mad scientist from 'Godzilla.' It's a good look for you.''</p>
        <p>And so on. All in all, the jokes are fast, smart and kind, a sort of mobile group therapy. (Accordingly, everyone knows far, far too much about everyone else's personal life.) And as juvenile as some of the kidding may be, the group members agreed that it was the only surefire way to fight the fatigue caused by the hectic schedule and the constant bone-jiggling motion of the bus.</p>
        <p>The final defense against exhaustion sat behind ''the living room,'' however, a curtained sleeping nook used in informal shifts by all the actors.</p>
        <p>On Sunday the nook almost worked too well. The actress Michelle Tauber, who played a witch in ''Macbeth,'' fell asleep on the ride to the theater and was forgotten when the rest of the actors disembarked. Twenty minutes later Ms. Tauber awoke to find herself alone on the bus, heading back to the hotel.</p>
        <p>''I was not amused,'' Ms. Tauber said later. But she made the curtain with time to spare.</p>
        <p>A Routine at 55 M.P.H.</p>
        <p>Part of the technical challenge of the tour is dealing with the layouts of different theaters.</p>
        <p>To direct the actors, Holly Katz, the company manager, makes dozens of arrowed signs pointing to dressing rooms, stage doors and vending machines. For the techies the changing layout means constantly adjusting the set to fit the playing space and finding room backstage wherever they can. In Nashville, this meant moving the costumes to a tent set up outside the back door in the middle of February.</p>
        <p>''It was fine, actually,'' said Max Darling, the tour's wardrobe supervisor. ''They had these big, scary kerosene heaters.''</p>
        <p>In Fairfax, Va., the theater was a handsome structure at George Mason University and was big enough for the costumes, wigs and sets. After a Friday night performance, crew members took down the set for ''The Rivals'' -- their drills were buzzing before the audience hit the exits -- and on Saturday morning, Macbeth's castle was assembled. The load-in took only about two hours; adjusting the lights, however, took most of the rest of the day.</p>
        <p>At 6 p.m. on Saturday the actors arrived to warm up, a time-honored tradition that vaguely resembles visiting hour at Bedlam. Actors grunted, stretched, counted to five, pulled at their faces, ran in place and generally did a lot of talking to themselves. Around them, a techie mopped the floor, unfazed.</p>
        <p>Others practiced different warm-up techniques. Mr. Anderson, who played several smaller roles in ''Macbeth,'' indulged his lower brain functions by playing a video game on his laptop.</p>
        <p>Gadgets have done a lot to mitigate the loneliness and inefficiency of touring since Houseman and his  group of actors first hit the road.  About half of the troupe's members carried cell phones and most checked e-mail regularly.</p>
        <p>Forty-five minutes before the performance, the three witches retired to the dressing room to don their fright wigs. The tour was surprisingly wig-heavy, with 17 in all being tended to by Emily Horton, the wig mistress. Here, too, the road makes its own rules; almost every night the wigs must be locked in a wood travel case. Bouncing along the highway often causes slight damage that requires repair before the next show.</p>
        <p>So Ms. Horton must often improvise. Ditto for the costumes, whose wear and tear often send Mr. Darling off into uncharted territory hunting for  replacement material.</p>
        <p>On this evening, though, all was well on the costume and wig front. Just before curtain, the actors joked about how to keep their characters fresh for the performance. Mr. Uffelman and Mr. Mills suggested repeating the end of each other's lines, while Erik Steele, who played Malcolm, pondered making his character a ''little spiky.''</p>
        <p>In the end, however, the actors delivered the same show that they had since their Staten Island premiere, and the audience, some 1,500 strong, seemed to lap it up.</p>
        <p>Afterward the actors stayed onstage for a question-and-answer session with about 150 audience members. (Q: ''Did you add lines to the script?'' A: ''I don't think so.'') Behind the actors, the crew is already taking down the set.</p>
        <p>Survival Skills</p>
        <p>The bus was supposed to leave at 10 a.m. sharp the next morning for Pittsburgh; stragglers were required to pay $1 a minute to a ''bus justice'' fund. (It was used to buy party favors on the last day of the tour.) Mr. McGinn was tardy on this morning, and later paid for it.</p>
        <p>En route from Fairfax to Pittsburgh (248 miles), the actors divulged some of their time-killing techniques, including an age-old method: shopping.</p>
        <p>''Seeing a rest area in the Midwest was like seeing God,'' said Heather Raffo (Lady Macbeth). ''Everyone would come back to the bus showing off their tchotchkes.''</p>
        <p>With only two performances left in Pittsburgh, however, the talk had become increasingly reflective.</p>
        <p>April Y. Thompson, who played a witch in ''Macbeth,'' had most of her mates in stitches with a dead-on imitation of a petulant hotel clerk whom  the troupe had encountered in Norwalk, Conn.</p>
        <p>''Hold on, hold on,'' Ms. Thompson said, striding up the bus aisle in character. ''I am only one person.'' Everybody, even Tim, laughed.</p>
        <p>The performance on Sunday night, at the Byham, a restored 1904 vaudeville theater in downtown Pittsburgh, went off without a hitch except for the temporary misplacing of Ms. Tauber. After hunting for food around the hotel -- the first choice was closed, predictably -- the group went to bed. Their final show of the tour, also at the Byham, was for students at 10 the next morning, and  to avoid traffic, the bus would be leaving at 6:30 a.m.</p>
        <p>The party would have to wait.</p>
        <p>Sentimental Journey</p>
        <p>Shortly after the student performance, troupe members climbed aboard the blue bus one last time. But the true end of the tour wouldn't come until almost 9 hours and 373 miles later as the bus pulled through the Lincoln Tunnel. On the journey home, Champagne was quaffed and toasts were made.</p>
        <p>''This group,'' Mr. Jean said, ''has jelled in a way that's exceptional and rare. I could not be the person I am without you.''</p>
        <p>It was a sentiment repeated several more times, and just as the prose began to border on the saccharine, one of the quieter troupe members pulled it back.</p>
        <p>''I was just touring for the insurance,'' said John Kinsherf, who played Banquo in ''Macbeth.'' ''I will be glad to be rid of you all.''</p>
        <p>The mood lightened; Ms. Thompson led a brief salsa-dancing clinic in the bus aisle. Mr. Anderson, Mr. Mills, Mr. Swarthout and Mr. McGinn drank many tiny bottles of Corona beer and debated the merits of Pearl Jam.</p>
        <p>As they approached Manhattan, however, the bus -- never exactly a quiet zone -- got almost hushed. Ella Fitzgerald was on the radio singing ''Blue Skies.'' The Macbeths held hands, and two newly formed couples snuggled as another two members slow danced in the dark.</p>
        <p>Ms. Barron, wedged between Mr. Uffelman and Ms. Thompson, broke the silence with a laugh.</p>
        <p>''It's funny,'' she said, leaning heavily on her friends. ''Nobody wants this trip to end.''</p>
        <p>Journey's End</p>
