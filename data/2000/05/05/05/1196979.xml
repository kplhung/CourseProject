        <p>''I think he got caught up in all of the things that were going on outside of the game, and you just can't do that,'' Chaney said of Camby.</p>
        <p>''It didn't distract me,'' Camby said. ''If anything, it distracted them. Their players were complaining about their coach. It never affected me.''</p>
