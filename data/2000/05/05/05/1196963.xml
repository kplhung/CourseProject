        <p>Earlier this week, during a team film session more about mistakes than miracles, Coach Jeff Van Gundy popped in the fourth-quarter video from the Knicks' Game 5 in Miami last year and let it roll.</p>
        <p>As the tape neared its end, and Allan Houston's runner bounced off the rim and the glass and into the net like a lucky ball on a roulette wheel, there was mostly silence in the room.</p>
        <p>''Maybe a couple of slight smiles,'' Houston said today after practice at SUNY-Purchase. ''It wasn't like we were going crazy, like it just happened. It's over with. I don't think Jeff put that tape in to fire us up or get excited. It was to learn. It wasn't that we played so great in that game, we just put ourselves in a position to get a good bounce.''</p>
        <p>A bounce that changed everything. It saved jobs, preserved the roster and led to the Knicks' run to the finals. It also served as the camouflage for what had been a miserable game for Houston. Until his last shot fell with eight-tenths of a second left, Houston had missed 8 of his previous 12 shots in the game.</p>
        <p>He has had much better success against the Heat since. As Sunday's Game 1 of the Knicks' second-round series against Miami approaches, Houston's numbers against the Heat this season -- 20.8 points a game, 49.2 percent shooting from the field -- underline how critical he is to his team's chances of advancing.</p>
        <p>But his sure touch is not guaranteed. Most of his success against Miami this season came before Coach Pat Riley of the Heat surfed the waiver wire and snatched up Bruce Bowen, a defender with the wingspan of a pterodactyl and the speed of a flashbulb. In other words, another Tracy McGrady type, especially designed to disrupt Houston's oiled release. In the first two games of the three-game sweep against the Raptors, Houston struggled before ending with a 23-point finish in Game 3. For the series, Houston shot 17 for 37 and averaged 18.5 points a game.</p>
        <p>''I read in a paper in Toronto that McGrady shut down Allan,'' said the Knicks assistant coach Don Chaney, who also coached Houston in Detroit. ''I disagree. I think Allan had bad shooting games. I don't think McGrady shut him down at all.</p>
        <p>''Allan stops Allan. I don't think there is any one guy -- if Allan is determined and does what he should do out there -- I don't think there is anybody who can stop Allan from getting his shot off.''</p>
        <p>But there are defenders capable of flustering him. That is what seemed to happen on Feb. 28, the night the Knicks squandered a 20-point, second-quarter lead against Miami. With Dan Majerle and Bowen pressuring him into a 5-for-13 game, Houston could not save the Knicks from defeat.</p>
        <p>''I think Allan has gotten over the fact of Bowen being there,'' Chaney said. ''I think when he first faced him down in Miami, I think Bowen got to him. I think since the second meeting, Allan figured out a way to free himself up, to create space. Now, I think he's looking forward to the challenge.''</p>
        <p>But who's looking forward to whom? Bowen and Majerle may be licking their lips over a chance to take advantage of Houston's soft spot: his defense. This season, Majerle played in three of the four games against the Knicks, shot 50 percent and averaged 10 points a game. In his two games against the Knicks, Bowen shot 77.8 percent -- including 7 of 16 from 3-point land -- and averaged 10 points a game. As is the pattern, Houston's relaxed perimeter defense, particularly in transition, was a liability.</p>
        <p>''To me, that's one of his weak points, and he knows that,'' Chaney said. ''He needs to understand the importance of what he should do on the defensive end. I think he works on it, but I think, at times, he doesn't think it's as important as his offense. To me, I'd love for him to score 20 points a game, but if he exchanges 20 points for 20 points, he's not helping us.''</p>
        <p>He can be defensive-minded when the mood strikes, though. Even though Houston battled his own shooting troubles in Game 5 last year, he was able to focus on his defense and held Majerle to one for six from the field and 3 points. If anything, Houston's game-winning shot was an act of perseverance.</p>
        <p>He doesn't need to see the replay to know that. Although he was given a tape of the final 2 minutes of Game 5, it is in his home stuffed behind a pile of videos featuring his daughter, Remie. Until Van Gundy popped in the fourth-quarter tape this week, Houston had not looked at the shot that has become part of Knick lore since last summer.</p>
        <p>''It'll be good a few years from now to show Remie,'' Houston said of his daughter, who was born days before last year's finals. ''But that shot is not doing anything for this team now. The bottom line is, if that ball had bounced out, it would have been a whole different thing. Fortunately, it bounced in.''</p>
        <p>And his shooter's touch was defined.</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>Although the controversy surrounding his choke hold of P. J. CARLESIMO was very different than the offensive remarks made by the Atlanta closer JOHN ROCKER in Sports Illustrated, LATRELL SPREWELL sees some similarities in their situations. ''The guy is going through a tough time, and from everything I've heard, he's been misunderstood over the things that he said,'' said Sprewell, who has been embraced by the league as a promotion tool recently. ''It would be very similar if, in a couple of years, the league asked him to do a spot for baseball. It would be very similar to what I've gone through.''</p>
