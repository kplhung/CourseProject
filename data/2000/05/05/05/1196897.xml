        <p>At the end of a rail journey through Vietnam in her acclaimed documentary ''Regret to Inform,'' Barbara Sonneborn arrives at the place where her husband, Jeff Gurvitz, was killed in 1968 trying to rescue his radio operator. Twenty-four years later the air still has the metallic smell of Agent Orange.</p>
        <p>Before he went to Vietnam, he said he wanted to serve his country the way his father had in World War II. While in combat he sent his wife a tape recording of his reflections. She was unable to listen to it for 20 years. ''Then I woke up on Jan. 1, 1988, as if I'd been struck by lightning and knew I had to do something about Jeff's death and the war,'' Ms. Sonneborn said in an interview.</p>
        <p>An artist and photographer, she decided on a film. ''Regret to Inform'' was nominated for an Oscar last year and won best director and best cinematography awards at the Sundance Film Festival. Last summer it had a successful theater run, and in January it was shown on PBS. This week it was released on tape and disc by Docurama and New Video.</p>
        <p>About a dozen war widows, American and Vietnamese, recount their experiences, interspersed with clips from the fighting that are no easier to watch today than they were then. One of the film's cinematographers, Emiko Omori, directed ''Rabbit in the Moon,'' about the emotional toll on Japanese-Americans interned during World War II, and there are similarly uncomfortable moments in ''Regret to Inform.''</p>
        <p>A Vietnamese-American, Xuan Ngoc Nguyen, served as translator during the filming in Vietnam in 1992. ''She got the fact that it wasn't about one side or the other,'' Ms. Sonneborn said. ''The common enemy was war.''</p>
        <p>As in any well-made documentary, smaller elements stand out. Widowed herself in the fighting, Ms. Nguyen became a prostitute who had a half-dozen American clients a night. Frequently they didn't want sex. ''They just yelled and cried,'' she says in the film.</p>
        <p>For the widows of the fallen G.I.'s, the cessation of mail was the first dreaded sign. Before she received the government's regrets, one widow in the film was sent a description of his wounds, which she reported to her doctor. ''Pray he dies,'' he told her.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Sonneborn went to make the documentary, she found no one willing to participate. ''I realized immediately that I had met only one other woman who was a widow of the Vietnam War,'' she said in the interview. When death notices appeared in newspapers, wives often got phone calls from strangers describing their husbands as baby killers who deserved to die. ''That makes people not want to talk a lot about their experience,'' she said.</p>
        <p>At first she looked for widows in Northern California, where she lives. ''When I put out I don't know how many thousands of flyers, I got only one response,'' she said.</p>
        <p>That changed with the Persian Gulf war in 1991. In the Bay Area protests were large. ''Many widows and veterans were disturbed that we were perhaps getting into another Vietnam,'' she said. ''They came out of the woodwork and began talking to each other. Out of that suddenly I was getting phone calls.''</p>
