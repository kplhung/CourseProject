        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was sorry to note that in your obituary of Cardinal John O'Connor (front page, May 4) you did not mention his ministry to those with AIDS. You told of the time that AIDS activists disrupted Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral, but you did not mention the cardinal's visits to people with AIDS in hospitals and the fact that he was a driving force behind the establishment of the first AIDS-only hospital unit in New York City.</p>

        <p>I am Roman Catholic, and I disagreed with the cardinal on more than one issue, but I certainly feel that he deserves credit for all the good things he did.</p>
