        <p>Attitude, the gritty urban ingredient that seemed to go missing with the fall of Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., is threatening to return to the capital city's profile in the form of a rebellious new license plate motto decrying the city's plight of ''Taxation Without Representation.''</p>
        <p>A proposal to proclaim that on District of Columbia license plates has been unanimously co-sponsored by City Council members to protest the fact that residents pay $2 billion in annual federal taxes but have failed repeatedly to gain a voting representative in Congress.</p>
        <p>''We don't have much chutzpah lately in this city, so why not make this an in-your-face issue?'' said Mark Plotkin, a local political broadcaster who was delighted to see the license plate proposal begin with an angry taxpayer's e-mail message and quickly spread through the City Council.</p>
        <p>This morning it even drew the endorsement of Mayor Anthony A. Williams, the gentler, nonconfrontational executive whose image is no match for the rapscallion style of Mr. Barry, who made a spectacle of this city's political status.</p>
        <p>Originally, Mayor Williams had wanted new license plate mottoes with optional pro-environment or pro-children themes. But he decided to join the protest movement, describing the motto as ''a creative and effective way to raise nationwide awareness about the lack of full democracy in the nation's capital.''</p>
        <p>Supporters, led by the council's chairwoman, Linda W. Cropp, are delighted that a city that must routinely police endless visits by protest groups might finally rise up on its own and put a dash of contumely before the eyes of the 25 million tourists who visit each year. President Clinton's limousine, like all other cars registered here, bears D.C. plates now proclaiming the tepid, noncontroversial plea to ''Celebrate &amp; Discover'' the nation's capital.</p>
        <p>Well worth discovering, Councilwoman Cropp emphasized, is the fact that the district maintains its own state-like level of services and finances 80 percent of local government needs, roughly $3.5 billion, through its 700,000 residents. The patriotic contribution in lives spent in the nation's wars, she said, makes the case even more compelling.</p>
        <p>''For us, this mirrors the frustration the colonials felt in padding the coffers of England and having no say,'' Ms. Cropp said, aiming to put the proposal on a fast track for approval.</p>
        <p>Under current House rules, the district has no representation in the Senate, while in the House its taxpayers have Eleanor Holmes Norton as their elected delegate, not representative. She has only limited power, able to vote in committee but never on the floor, where laws are enacted.</p>
        <p>''Most Americans don't even know the district lacks voting power, even though it pays the third highest per capita federal taxes in the nation,'' Ms. Norton said.</p>
        <p>''This is going to happen,'' she said of the license plate protest, predicting that Congress, which has review power over new laws passed by the council, would shy from interfering with such a basic expression of free speech.</p>
        <p>The delegate drew strong agreement from David L. Marin, the Republican spokesman for the House  subcommittee on the district. ''I see absolutely no reason why this Congress will not support the district's decision to highlight this inequity,'' said Mr. Marin, press secretary for the committee chairman, Representative Thomas M. Davis III, Republican of Virginia.</p>
        <p>Sarah Shapiro, a district native and angry taxpayer who proposed the license plate to Mr. Plotkin in an e-mail message, first suggested the edited version of the colonial rebels' cry of ''No taxation without representation!''</p>
        <p>''No one out there knows how benighted we are,'' said Ms. Shapiro, who made the proposal after a friend she considered well educated ''floored'' her by casually saying he thought district residents paid no Federal taxes and so did not deserve the right to vote in Congress.</p>
        <p>''I mean, we went to Yale together,'' Ms. Shapiro declared. ''This guy is not some shrub from Indiana.</p>
        <p>''People are clueless.'' she said, of such basic facts as district residents not gaining the right to vote in the presidential election until 1968.</p>
        <p>Fifty-five percent of the nation's college graduates do not know that district residents do not have equal voting rights in Congress, according to a recent poll by Bisconto Research Inc., cited by Ms. Norton. When properly informed, 72 percent of those polled supported voting rights.</p>
        <p>This provides evidence for the stand of Mr. Plotkin, the political broadcast polemicist who helped stir up the license plate proposal. He says the district badly needs to emblazon  its predicament.</p>
        <p>''We've been so appropriate lately,'' Mr. Plotkin complained. ''Now maybe we'll actually roil some people.''</p>
