        <p>HISS-Isabel Johnson (nee Dowden), widow of the late Alger Hiss, passed away peacefully at her Manhattan home, on May 3, 2000. She was 92 years old. Mrs. Hiss was born and raised in Montclair, New Jersey, the only child of Elsie Ruckelshaus Dowden and Dawson Dowden. In her twenties, she became a well-known fashion model in Paris and New York, and was photographed by the great photographers of the time, including Edward Steichen and Alfred Steiglitz. She was also a frequent model for the renowned illustrator, Rene Boucher. Mrs. Hiss went on to become the beauty editor of Glamour magazine and wrote many articles on health care issues. A memorial evening will be held at a later date. Donations in her memory may be made to The Nation Institute, 33 Irving Place, New York, NY 10003, and Doctors Without Borders USA, P.O. Box 110, New York, NY 10277.</p>
