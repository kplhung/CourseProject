        <p>Who could argue with a well-made family film that promotes tolerance, pacifism, equality for women and an unlikely relationship between opera and basketball?</p>
        <p>That's ''The Basket,'' a movie warmed by the golden prairie sun of interior Washington, near Spokane. Set in the region during World War I, the film is a glowing visual homage to rural small-town America in a storybook era just one click away from ''The Waltons.'' It conjures a time when ''way back East'' meant way, way, way back East, and the guns of August seemed to be on the other side of the world until the first mutilated, bitter casualty of war hobbled off the train.</p>

        <p>Who could argue with a well-made family film that promotes tolerance, pacifism, equality for women and an unlikely relationship between opera and basketball?</p>
        <p>That's ''The Basket,'' a movie warmed by the golden prairie sun of interior Washington, near Spokane. Set in the region during World War I, the film is a glowing visual homage to rural small-town America in a storybook era just one click away from ''The Waltons.'' It conjures a time when ''way back East'' meant way, way, way back East, and the guns of August seemed to be on the other side of the world until the first mutilated, bitter casualty of war hobbled off the train.</p>
        <p>''The Basket'' isn't as sentimental as ''The Waltons,'' but it places a similar faith in the nostalgic tug of vintage Americana. All the fabled iconography is here: a general store whose staples are kept in barrels and where exotic things like basketballs have to be ordered from a catalog; barns, tractors, dusty schoolhouses, rippling wheat fields and a vintage gramophone cranking out scratchy music.</p>
        <p>When the outside world intrudes into this spare, bucolic paradise, paradise is none too welcoming. ''The Basket'' tells the story of two German teenage war orphans from an internment camp who enter the community and are persecuted for their nationality. (The movie is saddled with inept, stagy flashbacks of their traumatic wartime experiences.) Another visitor who arouses suspicion is an unconventional schoolteacher, Martin Conlon (Peter Coyote), from way back East (Boston to be precise), who introduces basketball into the community, teaches the local boys to shoot into peach crates and organizes a team.</p>
        <p>Fortuitously, the German immigrant boy Helmut (Robert Karl Burke) proves to be the community's most talented player. The movie offers a realistic glimpse of the sport in its early days when the balls were heavier and made of thick leather.</p>
        <p>Martin also enthralls his students by introducing them to an allegorical opera, piece by piece, on a gramophone, as if it were a Dickens serial. It isn't long before not only his students but also everyone in the village is enthralled by its symbolism and its circuitous story, which the students bring home to their families after school. A pastiche of early 20th-century Germanic music, the heavily choral score was written by Don Caron, a Spokane-based composer. As the music winds through the film, it lends the movie an extra weight, although the opera's actual plot is told too sketchily for it to resonate.</p>
        <p>''The Basket'' brings these new arrivals into conflict with an archetypal all-American farming clan, the Emerys, who are forced to absorb the shocks of the war and of strangers with foreign accents, along with such exotica as opera. Nicholas (Jock MacDonald), the paterfamilias, is a bit of a bigot and a bit of a bully, whose narrow-mindedness undergoes a sea change after one of his sons returns from combat missing a leg, with no will to live.</p>
        <p>Karen Allen is his long-suffering wife, who develops a discreet crush on the more cosmopolitan Martin. It isn't until late in the movie, in a terribly contrived and unconvincing plot twist, that we learn Martin himself is fleeing a secret past.</p>
        <p>If the characters in ''The Basket'' never transcend the period stereotypes of a made-for-television movie, the acting is much better than average. ''The Basket,'' for the most part, avoids succumbing to the preachiness that is the bane of so many family films, and for a movie like this, that's no small feat.</p>
        <p>''The Basket'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has war scenes that might upset children.</p>
