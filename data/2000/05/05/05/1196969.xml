        <p>In reprisal for the fiercest cross-border attack since last June, Israeli warplanes bombarded two power stations and a guerrilla arms depot in Lebanon this morning.</p>
        <p>The cross-border attack, which occurred on Thursday evening, was itself retaliatory. A spate of casualties in southern Lebanon prompted Shiite Muslim guerrillas to fire five barrages of Katyusha rockets into northern Israel, killing one Israeli soldier and sowing panic in the northern border town of Qiryat Shemona.</p>
        <p>[In Beirut, witnesses said one civilian was wounded in the Israeli attack on the power station there, Reuters reported. Witnesses also said missiles blew a crater in the main highway between Beirut and Damascus.]</p>
        <p>''These air raids were a response to the Katyushas fired at Qiryat Shemona and the Galilee,'' an Israeli military statement said. ''The Israeli Defense Forces will continue to take all necessary action against Hezbollah and those backing it in order to defend the northern border.''</p>
        <p>The Hezbollah, or Party of God,  attacks had come after Israel and its South Lebanese militia allies had killed two Lebanese women and wounded several civilians on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
        <p>In retaliation later Thursday, Hezbollah guerrillas fired dozens of rockets into the border town of Qiryat Shemona, damaging buildings and slightly wounding 28 residents.</p>
        <p>An Israeli military spokesman said that Sgt. Shaked Ozeri, 24, was killed and another soldier wounded when their vehicle was hit by a rocket near the border.</p>
        <p>Followed by leaping flames, billowing black smoke and screaming sirens, the Katyusha rockets panicked residents of Israel's northern border communities, who have been anxiously awaiting Israel's impending troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon. Army officials ordered them into bomb shelters, and an amateur video on Israeli television showed a terrified mother with two young children running alongside burning cars toward a bunker.</p>
        <p>Hezbollah guerrillas said Israel and the South Lebanese Army had provoked the rocket attacks. ''After we exercised our long patience, we found ourselves pushed and obligated to exercise our right and duty to defend our people,'' said a statement by the Iran-backed group, which is trying to dislodge Israeli troops from southern Lebanon.</p>
        <p>South Lebanese Army soldiers killed the two Lebanese women -- Almaza Mizhir, 80, and her daughter, Ilham Tawil, of the nearly deserted village of Kutrana -- in what Israeli officials termed an ''unauthorized raid.'' Three guerrillas were subsequently killed in an Israeli air force attack.</p>
        <p>And on Wednesday, a dozen Lebanese civilians were wounded in what Israeli Army officials called a pilot's accidental dropping of a 660-pound bomb, which happened to strike the home of a guerrilla leader. The leader was unharmed, but his mother was among the civilians hurt.</p>
        <p>Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, who has pledged to withdraw troops by July, convened a meeting of his security cabinet Thursday night to consider further action. Afterward, the Israeli radio reported  that many ministers had agreed that Israel would have to respond.</p>
        <p>Late Thursday, American diplomats were consulting with the parties to the conflict to try to keep the violence from growing. Mr. Barak had been meeting with Dennis Ross, the American peace envoy, when he received word of the rocket attacks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak was facing pressure from right-wing leaders and some northern Israeli community leaders to order an immediate bombardment of Lebanon, similar to the retaliatory air-strikes in June that crippled the Lebanese infrastructure and killed eight civilians.</p>
        <p>In February, after several Israeli soldiers were killed in Lebanon, Mr. Barak ordered a more limited bombing raid that knocked out three Lebanese power plants.</p>
        <p>The latest burst of violence came as preparations were increasing for Israel's troop withdrawal. Israeli Army outposts are starting to be dismantled, their equipment hauled back inside Israel. And soldiers are building new border fences.</p>
