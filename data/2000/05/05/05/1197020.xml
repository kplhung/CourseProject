        <p>Today we will attempt to get up to speed on the New York Senate race. It seems like only yesterday that commentators were asking whether Rudy Giuliani's rant about federal ''storm troopers'' in Miami was a clever ploy to detract attention from his wife's upcoming role in ''The Vagina Monologues.'' That was a great moment, definitely. But so much has happened since.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani won a lot of good will last week when he announced he was battling prostate cancer. Not the least important show of support came from his wife, Donna Hanover, who gave up her chance to talk about female body parts Off Broadway. That was about the most positive gesture Ms. Hanover has made in her husband's direction since she refused to reveal whom she voted for in the last mayoral election.</p>
        <p>But that was days ago. Now attention has switched from the mayor's prostate to the tabloids' fascination with identifying his current dinner companion, a woman whom he described as ''a very good friend.'' This was pretty forthcoming for the mayor, who usually regards queries about his personal life as a trumpet call to arms.</p>
        <p>And on the policy front, Mr. Giuliani continued his attacks on the retrieval of Elian Gonzalez, which he said had been accomplished by officers wielding ''machine guns.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton announced she had visited all 62 New York counties.</p>
        <p>In this race, the Clintonesque candidate is Rudy Giuliani -- up, down, good, bad -- after a while you have to just admire the way he keeps chugging along. Let's examine some recent developments:</p>
        <p>Timing: Mr. Giuliani's cancer prognosis is very favorable. If he wants to run, there's every reason to think he should be able to have his treatment, recover and get back on the trail before fall. If all goes well, most voters will have forgotten he was ever ill. On the other hand, they will also have gotten used to the idea that Mrs. Clinton is a New Yorker. Really, it already seems as if she's been here for decades.</p>
        <p>The events: At a televised question-and-answer session upstate, Mr. Giuliani gave one hint that he may be thinking statewide at last, making a rare admission that he grew up in  Long Island, not the streets of Brooklyn. In her own similar appearance, Mrs. Clinton practically had to be tied down before she'd stop talking about reducing energy costs in upstate New York.</p>
        <p>The nominations: In New York, third parties solve the problem of attracting votes by simply cross-endorsing Democrats and Republicans.  Once established, these organizations marinate in their own juices until they ripen into political extortion schemes, renting out their ballot line to the highest bidders.</p>
        <p>The Liberals have a long and happy relationship with Mr. Giuliani, whose administration has been a veritable employment agency for relatives of party leaders. The Conservatives are a little less far along the evolutionary scale, and the mayor's supporters are terrified they might muddy the waters and nominate an actual conservative.</p>
        <p>Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Giuliani met recently with the leaders of the Independence Party. If they can get out of court long enough to have a convention, these people seem intent on demonstrating their inclusiveness by nominating Pat Buchanan for president under the leadership of Lenora Fulani, a Marxist. Mrs. Clinton ruled out being on a Buchanan ticket. But Mr. Giuliani, who seems to be envisioning a ballot in which his name appears so often that voters are mesmerized, left the door open a crack.</p>
        <p>The marriages: This campaign may do for married names what John Kennedy's election did to hats. Mrs. Clinton is running as just plain ''HILLARY!'' and Ms. Hanover has long since dropped the ''Giuliani.''</p>
        <p>In the most-discussed political development of the week, we learned that the mayor's new very good friend is a Manhattan resident who met him at a parent-teacher gathering. (Have we mentioned the Giuliani education agenda?) She has been seen in his company at events ranging from New Year's Eve at Times Square to town hall meetings in the outer boroughs. The voters may be willing to leave Mr. Giuliani alone on this one, but if his companion is willing to sit through town halls, it sounds pretty serious.</p>
