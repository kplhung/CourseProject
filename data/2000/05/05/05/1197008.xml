        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is to begin broadcasting a 60-second statewide television commercial today called ''A New York Senator.'' The campaign says it is spending ''upwards of six figures'' to buy time for the ad. Mr. Giuliani's campaign advisers say the ad is evidence that the mayor is in the Senate race to stay.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Victory Group Inc.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Feel-good, sparkling scenes from upstate New York, interspersed with shots of the mayor shaking hands and speaking to a cheering crowd last week in Saratoga Springs. A succession of claims appears on the screen: ''Created 380,000 new jobs. Cut taxes $2.4 billion -- a 30-year record! Made New York safest large city in America.''</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- The announcer begins: ''The campaign for New York continues as Rudy Giuliani is bringing his record of success and integrity straight to the people of New York.'' Mr. Giuliani takes over as the commercial cuts to a speech he gave last Friday in Saratoga Springs: ''We should be honest with each other, and we should be for real and we should be authentic. I want to be a senator because I was born in this state. I want to be a senator because I've served this state. I have ideas that I believe work, that I've put into practice. ''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The city's most recent financial plan shows that 347,000 private-sector jobs have been created from 1994, the year that Mr. Giuliani became mayor, through the end of 1999. Mr. Giuliani is correct in saying that city taxes have been cut by $2.4 billion during his tenure, although a number of the tax cut proposals were initiated by the City Council and some were at least initially opposed by the mayor. Mr. Giuliani is also correct in saying that New York is America's ''safest large city,'' a claim backed up by the latest available F.B.I. crime statistics.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The ad makes it clear that Mr. Giuliani has been campaigning north of the Bronx, despite complaints from upstate Republicans who want to see more of him. The commercial is also intended to convey the message that the mayor is a native New Yorker who has held elective office and has a public record, and whose statements are not scripted by media consultants -- a charge the mayor frequently makes against Hillary Rodham Clinton, his opponent.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's campaign officials say the ad does not tell viewers where Mr. Giuliani stands. ''Sooner or later, Rudy Giuliani is going to have to tell New Yorkers what he would do in the Senate,'' said Karen Dunn, a spokeswoman.</p>
