        <p>The dispute between Time Warner and the Walt Disney Company that led to ABC's being blocked from 3.5 million homes earlier this week is proving to be a boon for the satellite television industry.</p>
        <p>About 25,000 Time Warner subscribers have asked for the coupons that entitle them to receive free equipment from DirecTV, a unit of Hughes Electronics, which is a division of General Motors, and thousands more have subscribed to the Dish Network of EchoStar Communications.</p>

        <p>The dispute between Time Warner and the Walt Disney Company that led to ABC's being blocked from 3.5 million homes earlier this week is proving to be a boon for the satellite television industry.</p>
        <p>About 25,000 Time Warner subscribers have asked for the coupons that entitle them to receive free equipment from DirecTV, a unit of Hughes Electronics, which is a division of General Motors, and thousands more have subscribed to the Dish Network of EchoStar Communications.</p>
        <p>Since the dispute began, DirecTV executives said, 20,000 Time Warner subscribers in Houston and another 5,000 in New York and Los Angeles have requested full rebate coupons, but it is unclear exactly how many of them have bought the systems.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, EchoStar told retailers to start giving away its Dish Network equipment to Time Warner customers in those cities and Philadelphia if they agree to buy its service for one year. Executives from the company were unable to say yesterday how many people had responded, but they said it was in the thousands.</p>
        <p>Executives from both companies said they began planning to capitalize on the dispute months ago after Disney, which owns ABC, and Time Warner reached an impasse. The executives said they saw the situation as a perfect national advertisement for their services. Their marketing campaigns describe their services as superior to the cable services and describe the cable companies as arrogant and inattentive.</p>
        <p>''We had an opportunity to say 'Look, there is an alternative and we're going to make it easier for you to switch to Dish Network,' '' said Charles Ergen, the chief executive of EchoStar.</p>
        <p>Executives at DirecTV said they were also making plans to step into the fray, but their plans accelerated in February, when they were approached by ABC on a joint agreement to give away dishes for two weeks in Houston as a way to put pressure on Time Warner there. The two companies are splitting the cost of the rebates, though neither would disclose terms of their agreement.</p>
        <p>The DirecTV offer was revived in Houston and expanded to include New York and Los Angeles on Wednesday, after Time Warner had already agreed to return the ABC signal to its systems, at least until a new July 15 negotiating deadline passes. The deal, which includes a $99 rebate and free installation, is expected to stay in place for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>''Our first priority was uninterrupted service for all of our viewers,'' said Julie Hoover, an ABC spokeswoman. ''In light of the recent threat, we thought it was important for viewers to have the security of an alternative.''</p>
        <p>Time Warner executives said they considered Disney's partnership with DirecTV an act of bad faith.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, it is something that we think they should suspend as a way of demonstrating good faith,'' said Mike Luftman, a Time Warner Cable spokesman.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Time Warner began offering rebates and a free one-month subscription to one of its premium movie services to the customers who were affected. [Page B10.]</p>
        <p>Also yesterday, Time Warner's chairman, Gerald M. Levin, called for a cooling of the heated exchanges; ABC executives said that Robert A. Iger, the president of Disney, spoke by telephone with Time Warner's president, Richard D. Parsons, about resuming talks.</p>
        <p>Time Warner executives said it was impossible to tell exactly how much damage the satellite offers from DirecTV and EchoStar had done to its bottom line. Neither satellite company can say how many of the people who requested rebates actually installed the service and disconnected their cable.</p>
        <p>Larry Gerbrandt, a media analyst for Paul Kagan Associates, said each subscriber represented $4,000 to $6,000 of potential revenue over the life of a contract.</p>
        <p>While the loss may hurt, Mr. Gerbrandt said, there are much bigger things at stake in the negotiations -- like how much power Time Warner is going to have after it is merged with America Online.</p>
        <p>''These are big boys playing for large stakes,'' he said. ''It's not about 25,000 subscribers.''</p>
