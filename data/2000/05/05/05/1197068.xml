        <p>Ace Gallery</p>

        <p>Through May 12</p>
        <p>Lawrence Carroll's work has changed little since it began to appear in New York in the late 1980's. Now a Los Angeles resident and in his mid-40's, Mr. Carroll still makes poetically gloomy, dirty white, boxy, irregular paintings that verge on sculpture. Glued, patched, stapled and otherwise cobbled together, they look as if they had been abandoned for years in some funky basement. They can be 12 feet high and jut out 2 feet from the wall or have windows with dried ivy or a folded tarp inside.</p>
        <p>For all the physical presence, however, there is a curious lack of energy; a mood, even, of depression. This is compelling in a way. Old shoes or dried bouquets evoke a sense of nostalgic loss. But the ennui also conveys diminished creative vigor.</p>

        <p>Lawrence Carroll's work has changed little since it began to appear in New York in the late 1980's. Now a Los Angeles resident and in his mid-40's, Mr. Carroll still makes poetically gloomy, dirty white, boxy, irregular paintings that verge on sculpture. Glued, patched, stapled and otherwise cobbled together, they look as if they had been abandoned for years in some funky basement. They can be 12 feet high and jut out 2 feet from the wall or have windows with dried ivy or a folded tarp inside.</p>
        <p>For all the physical presence, however, there is a curious lack of energy; a mood, even, of depression. This is compelling in a way. Old shoes or dried bouquets evoke a sense of nostalgic loss. But the ennui also conveys diminished creative vigor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carroll's works bring to mind some familiar textbook influences: Jasper Johns, most obviously, but also Joseph Cornell, Giorgio Morandi, Frank Stella, Donald Judd and Robert Ryman. Under all those influences Mr. Carroll himself becomes indistinct, and the depressed mood is experienced as a hopeless feeling that everything interesting has been done and that all that is left is to construct tasteful ancestral memorials. One wants to urge this artist to try something radically new.</p>
