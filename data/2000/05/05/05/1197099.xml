        <p>MARSH-Claudia Haines, pastpresident of Public Welfare Foundation of Washington, D.C. died Wednesday, May 3 at her home. She was 100. Mrs. Marsh was the widow of Charles E. Marsh, who established the foundation in 1947 in Austin, TEX. The offices were eventually moved to Washington, where Mr. Marsh died in 1964. Mr. and Mrs. Marsh were married in 1953. In 1952 Mrs. Marsh became actively involved in the foundation's operation when Mr. Marsh donated three newspapers he owned to the foundation to provide a source of greater and more permanent funding. She served as president from 1952 until her retirement in 1974. The foundation grew from its modest beginning into an international organization providing assistance to people and organizations who could get help from no other source. Mr. and Mrs. Marsh established a system of agents throughout the world to extend the foundation's activities. Agents received modest monthly stipends to assist people in need. Mrs. Marsh kept in regular contact with agents, many of whom were selected during their travels. Others were family members and friends. The agent system was later abandoned as the foundation developed in size. Claudia Elizabeth Kellogg was born in Oak Park, IL. On Nov. 7, 1899. After her mother's untimely death she moved to Summit, NJ to live with her aunt and uncle Mr. and Mrs. George LeHuray. She graduated from Kent Place School in Summit and attended Smith College. Her marriage to Charles Ernst Haines ended in divorce. She is survived by her daughter, Mrs. Donald T. Warner of Salisbury, CT; her son, Davis Haines, Virginia Beach, VA; seven grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at a later date. Memorial contributions may be made to a charity of your choice.</p>
