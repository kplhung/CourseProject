        <p>Ending a protest that had been an irritant to the Clinton administration for nearly a year, about 300 armed federal agents swept onto a Navy bombing range here before dawn today, peacefully removing about 200 demonstrators encamped on this lightly populated island.</p>
        <p>With a force in reserve kept out of sight in case trouble developed, a group of about 100 United States marshals, beginning at about 5 a.m., cleared more than 40 people -- mostly middle-aged residents of the island -- from their campsite blocking the main gate to Camp Garcia, the entrance to the sprawling military training range.</p>
        <p>Simultaneously, a team of about 200 F.B.I. agents arrived by small boat and helicopter, rounding up another group of roughly 150 from about a dozen protest sites deep inside the range, which is about 10 miles from the main entrance to the naval base.</p>
        <p>Both sides reported that the apprehensions took place without violence or injuries. The protesters, who were detained but not arrested, were flown by helicopter or ferried to Roosevelt Roads, a Navy base on Puerto Rico, where they were released without being booked.</p>
        <p>Attorney General Janet Reno reluctantly ordered the operation at the prodding of Pentagon officials insistent that they needed the range cleared of demonstrators who, in widely varying numbers, had camped out there for nearly a year, forcing the Navy to halt bombing exercises at what Pentagon officials considered a crucial aerial bombing site.</p>
        <p>Federal officials were anxious to complete today's operation without the complaints in Congress that followed Ms. Reno last month after  military-style tactics were used in the raid in Miami to reunite Elian Gonzalez with his father.</p>
        <p>This morning, Ms. Reno went with the F.B.I. director, Louis J. Freeh, to the Strategic Information Operations Center at the bureau headquarters in Washington, where they supervised the highly unusual sea-and-land assault, which was coordinated with the Navy and the Coast Guard.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officials formally returned the base to military control at about 5 p.m. A Pentagon official in Washington said that training exercises on the island would start again over the next six weeks.</p>
        <p>To keep fresh waves of demonstrators out, the Navy brought in a force of marines to take up positions on the scrub-forested perimeter and beaches of Camp Garcia. Officials announced that a security zone covering the island's surrounding waters was being expanded to keep private and commercial boats far from its shores.</p>
        <p>By early afternoon, Coast Guard cutters patrolled the Caribbean about a mile or two off shore, their white hulls slashed by single red stripes, the only visible craft near the island on the broad dazzling sea.</p>
        <p>Senior F.B.I. officials said that as a result of the protests following the immigration service operation in Miami, they intentionally tried to soften the appearance of the SWAT teams that took part in the operation. James K. Weber, the F.B.I. commander of the operation, said in a telephone interview that agents wore light khaki trousers, white T-shirts, blue protective vests and caps as part of a ''soft look'' that would not seem provocative or intimidating.</p>
        <p>Referring to a widely published photograph of a heavily armed agent retrieving Elian from a closet of his great-uncle's home, Mr. Weber said:  ''It was not in our agency's interest to have similar images in our case. We did take steps to ensure that those wouldn't happen.''</p>
        <p>But all the agents in the operation today were armed, most with F.B.I. standard-issue handguns, although some had automatic weapons. Mr. Weber said that none of the agents drew weapons. He said some agents also carried helmets with visors, but he said most agents removed them because of the heat and when it became apparent that the protesters posed little threat.</p>
        <p>Today's action to evict the demonstrators, who have demanded that the Navy halt bombing exercises and leave the island, ended with unusual decorum displayed by both sides.</p>
        <p>SWAT units were accompanied by Spanish-speaking negotiators who asked demonstrators to leave after advising them that they were trespassing, officials said. Many agreed to walk out on their own, some in plastic handcuffs, some singing and praying.</p>
        <p>At one camp, the authorities permitted protesters to conduct a flag-lowering ceremony before they were escorted away, officials said. At another site on the bombing range, one protester hid inside a tank used for target practice, but after about an hour in hiding he voluntarily emerged to be transported away by F.B.I. agents, officials said.</p>
        <p>Later, Ms. Reno, speaking to reporters at a Washington news conference, said none of the demonstrators would be charged with crimes unless they attempted new forays into Camp Garcia, where bombing operations are to resume later this month with nonexploding ordnance.</p>
        <p>Among the protesters detained were two United States Representatives, Nydia M. Velazquez of New York and Luis V. Gutierrez of Illinois, both Democrats. Several Puerto Rican legislators with the group were also escorted away by marshals.</p>
        <p>''This is our way to express our commitment that we will not stop to assure that this land will be returned to our brothers and sisters,'' Congresswoman Velazquez said as she walked arm-in-arm with other protesters into federal custody. At her side were two other New Yorkers, Roberto Ramirez, a Democratic state assemblyman from the Bronx, and City Councilman Jose Rivera.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramirez said protest demonstrations over Vieques would take place in North American cities soon, culminating in the Puerto Rican Day observance in New York on June 11.</p>
        <p>Only some 60 local residents were across the street from the main gate when the federal operation began promptly at 5 a.m. Puerto Rican national police blocked access to the area but the onlookers offered only vocal support to the protesters seated on folding chairs about 100 feet away in front of the gate.</p>
        <p>''Peace be with us, peace be with us, peace is always with us,'' strong voices lifted in a moving chorus from both sides of the street as the protesters were slowly led away.</p>
        <p>Later in the morning, about 300 men, women and children -- Vieques has a population of about 9,000 --  assembled peacefully in a plaza in Isabel Segunda, the island's largest town. In a mood more festive than angry, they marched in a circle to a salsa beat tattooed out on drums, half-singing, half-shouting ''Vieques, Si! Navy, No!'' Many stores closed at midday in support of the protest.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno, who seemed relieved that the operation had gone off smoothly, expressed gratitude about the restraint shown in Vieques. ''All indications are that the protesters have handled themselves in a peaceful and dignified manner,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Protest leaders worked for weeks to ensure that long-simmering emotions associated with the hot-button bombing issue would not flare into violence.</p>
        <p>Protests erupted at different points over the decades, the latest ignited when a security worker employed by the Navy was killed last spring by an errant bomb dropped by a Marine Corps F-18 fighter jet.</p>
        <p>The Navy regards Vieques as an important live-fire training site for planes and ships in the Atlantic fleet. President Clinton in January presented a $90 million plan to compensate Puerto Rico if the Commonwealth supported a resumption of bombing.</p>
        <p>Puerto Rico's Governor, Pedro Rossello, has proposed a referendum to let residents of Vieques decide the future of their island. Under the terms of a deal with the White House, if they reject the proposal the Navy would pull out in three years.</p>
