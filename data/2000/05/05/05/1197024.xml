        <p>In a pointed rebuke to Prime Minister Tony Blair and a setback to the charmed life of his three-year-old government, Londoners have chosen a maverick populist candidate, Ken Livingstone, to become the first elected mayor in the city's history.</p>
        <p>Mr. Livingstone, who was ousted from Mr. Blair's Labor Party after he decided to run as an independent, succeeded despite elaborate government efforts to block his candidacy and frequent assertions from Mr. Blair that Mr. Livingstone would be a ''disastrous'' choice for London.</p>
        <p>An antic politician once known as Red Ken, Mr. Livingstone was from the demonstrative left wing of Labor that Mr. Blair holds responsible for having made the party mistrusted and unelectable for decades.</p>
        <p>With vote counting continuing past midnight after Thursday's election, Mr. Livingstone, 54, was projected by the BBC to be the winner with an estimated 51 percent of the vote, followed by the Conservative Steven Norris, 54, a transportation minister in Prime Minister John Major's government. Mr. Blair's former Health Secretary, Frank Dobson, 59, the official Labor candidate, was coming in a distant and embarrassing third with only 14 percent of the vote, the BBC said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dodson, who had been dragooned into giving up his cabinet post and running for mayor, had led the only other major candidate, the Liberal Democrat Susan Kramer, 49, an investment banker.</p>
        <p>Mr. Livingstone headed the last local government in London, the runaway Greater London Council that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher abolished in 1986, seeing in its profligate ways an obstacle to her sweeping cuts in social spending. At the time, Mr. Livingstone led what was widely derided as the Loony Left for its sponsorship of causes like ''Babies Against the Bomb'' and ''The Campaign to Curb Police Power.''</p>
        <p>Though the London mayoral race was the big attention-getter, there were 3,300 local councilors being elected throughout England in what could be the last test of British public opinion before the next national election, expected a year from now. The Labor performance here too was disappointing, though the party in office traditionally does badly in midterm elections, and the anticipated loss of seats appeared to be within the expected range.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair remains extremely popular, and his government still holds a commanding lead of 20 points over the Conservatives in polls asking voters whom they would vote for if a national election were held now.</p>
        <p>Anthony King, professor of government at Essex University, warned against reading too much significance into Thursday's results for Labor's chances of keeping power a year from now. ''National and local elections are if anything diverging more and more in Britain,'' he said, ''with local elections becoming increasingly local.''</p>
        <p>The turnout on Thursday was 27 percent, compared with 71 percent in the last national election.</p>
        <p>Even some of Mr. Blair's supporters complain about the tight control his New Labor party exercises, and a large part of Mr. Livingstone's appeal was thought to stem from voters' desire to express their irritation at what they perceive as governmental arrogance.</p>
        <p>Conservatives portrayed the outcome of the local elections as evidence that they were finally recovering from the defeat they suffered in the 1997 national election that brought Mr. Blair to power. Their leader, William Hague, worked aggressively to get the Tory vote out by seizing on emotive causes like the numbers of asylum seekers coming to Britain, law and order in the countryside and the right of property owners to take up arms against intruders.</p>
        <p>In comments that drew objections from civil rights proponents, he said that Britain had become a ''soft touch'' for ''bogus'' refugees and he warned of a flood of illegal immigrants if procedures were not tightened up.</p>
        <p>There was a degree of irony in Mr. Blair's nemesis inheriting the new job since it was the prime minister  who created it. An elected mayor for London and eventually for other British cities is part of the plan called ''devolution'' under which the Blair government has spread power -- ''devolved'' it -- to regional legislatures in places like Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>With a cheeky sense of humor and a tart tongue and nasal Londoner twang to convey it, Mr. Livingstone built up a popular fondness that allowed him to survive several campaign gaffes. He was rebuked by Parliament for not revealing hundreds of thousands of pounds in income, He also professed his belief in ''direct action'' at the same time that rioting demonstrators acting in its name were causing extensive damage to businesses and memorials in the center of the city. And he also incurred the wrath of members of the financial community and some Jewish leaders by saying that international capitalism had killed as many people as Hitler.</p>
        <p>Though the job has the greatest popular mandate of any elected position in Britain, and offers Mr. Livingstone the public visibility that he thrives on, the powers of the office itself over London's 7.2 million residents are limited. The new post was created largely to coordinate the powers of the city's 32 boroughs, which will continue to deliver services and levy local taxes. The mayor also answers to a new 25-member London Assembly, which was also elected on Thursday.</p>
        <p>The mayor can draw up strategies for transportation, planning, economic development, environmental issues and culture, but the job of putting the ideas into action will belong to four new authorities, some of  whose members will be selected by the national government.</p>
        <p>Though the new mayor will manage a budget of $5 billion, almost all of it comes from the national treasury, now in the penny-pinching hands of Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown.</p>
        <p>In a display of his love of sticking his finger in the eye of authority that endears him to his followers, Mr. Livingstone said in the campaign that he thought Mr. Brown should be sacked.</p>
