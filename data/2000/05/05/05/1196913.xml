        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Laurence Steinberg (''Software Can't Make School Safe,'' Op-Ed, April 22) criticizes the Mosaic system, which my company developed,  apparently without understanding that it is a method for threat assessment, one part of which is computer-assisted. It is not predictive and doesn't claim to be scientific.</p>
        <p>The group advising on the field test version included experts assigned by the nation's two largest prosecutor's offices and two largest school districts, other schools and university police departments. My company has not paid any adviser on the project.</p>
        <p>Mosaic 2000 cannot ''label'' any student as dangerous. It provides a guide for assessing threats by students, period.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinberg says, ''We simply cannot predict violent acts.'' But imagine a student who had been reported to the police three times for threatening to kill another student, had written on his Web site that he planned to ''shoot as many of you as I can'' and had built a bomb.</p>
        <p>That student's name is Eric Harris, one of the gunmen at Columbine High School, and a method like Mosaic would have guided officials to this information about him. In the real world, schools are concerned with prevention, not prediction.</p>
