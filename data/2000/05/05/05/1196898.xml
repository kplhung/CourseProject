        <p>''Adrenaline Drive'' was shown as part of this year's New Directors/ New Films series. Here are excerpts from Elvis Mitchell's review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 24. The film opens today in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Shinobu Yaguchi's road comedy ''Adrenaline Drive'' feels as if it were built to fit the contours of pop music, with oddball, freaky bits of comedy that leap out of nowhere.</p>
        <p>When the out-of-it Suzuki (Masanobu Ando) stands before a group of gangsters and punishment is imminent, one of the crooks loosens his pants and begins to slide his belt out of its loops. The diffident Suzuki barely has enough going on to hold his head up under the best of circumstances -- and he doesn't see too many of those -- and bends his neck down even farther as his mouth goes slack with fear. But the thug is just tucking his shirt into his pants.</p>
        <p>''Adrenaline Drive'' is a fluky cartoon, a virginal romantic comedy that doesn't oversell itself. At times, it even feels full-bodied and slightly melancholy. At its chewy candy center it's one of those follow-the-money pictures, in which Suzuki and Shizuko, innocent young lovers, are pulled out of their humdrum lives after falling into enough dough to float an island republic or buy a controlling interest in Microsoft.</p>
        <p>Suzuki, who seems to be in a constant stupor, works for a car rental company. When his irresponsible colleague causes Suzuki to plow their car into the gleaming Jaguar of the gangster Kuroiwa (Yutaka Matushige), Suzuki finds himself being held hostage by the Yakuza That Couldn't Shoot Straight.</p>
        <p>Their headquarters is a shambles, with frightened idiots stumbling all over themselves. Suzuki is too petrified to move as he awaits punishment from Kuroiwa, a meanie who looks as if he has spent a great deal of time studying the comedian Beat Takeshi's collection of glowers.</p>
        <p>Shizuko (Hikari Ishida) is a nurse who devotes herself to her job while her colleagues gossip about boys and marriage, and about Shizuko when she's out of earshot. ''You need a reason to change,'' she is told, which is an engraved invitation to fate, or at least for the plot to take flight.</p>
        <p>Like the friendly Japanese pop that it seems to be modeled after, ''Adrenaline Drive'' has a likably repetitive scheme catchy enough to keep it bouncing around in your head. Kuroiwa is its refrain, a growly bad sport given to impulsively breaking thumbs. He's indomitable: after being blown up and strapped to a gurney in an ambulance that then sinks, he still shows up with his temper remarkably intact. It's his rechargeable rage that keeps him going.</p>
        <p>Kuroiwa's injuries come from a stove mishap that explodes the yakuza's lair. Instead of being forced to repay Kuroiwa for the car, Suzuki suddenly has one of those big metallic suitcases seen only in the movies -- or at dance clubs -- full of cash. And instead of treating Suzuki for his injuries, Shizuko is now dragging him along, determined to break them out of their cramped, ordinary little lives. After going in for a makeover, she frees herself from locking her stare onto the linoleum.</p>
        <p>''Adrenaline Drive'' is as bright and shiny as a Pizzicato Five pop single. Mr. Yaguchi's cutting rhythms are brassy and full of so many other influences that it's disconcerting to try to tick them all off. It seems probable that producers eager to cast Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon will chase after the remake rights, ignoring the fact that every other Andrew McCarthy movie of the 1980's had more or less the same plot. But Mr. Yaguchi's film is so brazenly cheerful and charmingly engineered that even the sourballs in the cast are sucked in.</p>
