        <p>Vibe/Spin Ventures announced yesterday that it would stop publishing Blaze Magazine, the hip-hop monthly title founded in 1998. The company's chief executive, Robert L. Miller, said the magazine fell short of circulation and advertising goals.</p>
        <p>The magazine is not audited by the Audit Bureau of Circulations.</p>
        <p>Vibe/Spin Ventures also publishes Vibe and Spin magazines, monthly music magazines.</p>
        <p>The first issue of Blaze set records for advertising with 120 pages, according to Jesse Washington, who was then Blaze's editor. The first issue sold 250,000 copies; the second, 300,000.</p>
        <p>The magazine had a fiery beginning in other ways: in the first issue, Mr. Washington wrote an editorial note in which he accused a rap star, Wyclef Jean, of aiming a shotgun at him and threatening to murder him if the editor gave the rapper a bad record review. Mr. Jean denied that the incident ever occurred.</p>
        <p>Blaze's demise comes two months after Mr. Miller announced he would not sell Vibe/Spin Ventures, which he had offered for sale in October. Potential buyers balked at the reported $200 million price tag. Blaze has not been profitable, while Vibe and Spin have grown in circulation and advertising revenue in the last year.</p>
