        <p>Though the number of tuberculosis cases in the United States has fallen to an all-time low, a panel of experts called yesterday for renewed efforts to prevent the disease, including screening immigrants for the dormant form of TB and tripling the financing for tuberculosis research.</p>
        <p>There were just 17,528 cases of active tuberculosis disease reported in the United States last year, down from 18,361 cases in 1998 and fully a third less than the recent peak of 26,673 set in 1992.</p>
        <p>Still, according to a report from the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, because tuberculosis remains widespread in many parts of the world, the current decline in the United States could easily reverse.</p>
        <p>''U.S. policy makers cannot afford to relax their vigilance,'' Morton N. Swartz, a professor at Harvard Medical School, said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Swartz, the chairman of the committee that wrote the report, added that ''current efforts at TB control will not be sufficient, and doing less could be disastrous.''</p>
        <p>The committee warned against a replay of the 1970's, when declining TB rates led to a dismantling of prevention and treatment programs. A decade later, in the late 1980's, TB infection rates rose again, with drug-resistant strains emerging.</p>
        <p>Part of the difficulty in eradicating tuberculosis is that the airborne bacteria that cause it can lie inactive in a person's lungs for years, with the host entirely unaware of the infection. An estimated 90 percent of people infected by the bacteria never develop the active form of the disease, which can cause a persistent cough, chest pain, fatigue and fever.</p>
        <p>The report urges new efforts at detecting latent tuberculosis infections, particularly among immigrants. Though immigrants account for only 10 percent of the United States population, they constitute about 40 percent of active tuberculosis cases.</p>
        <p>It recommended that immigrants from countries with high incidence of the disease, mostly in Asia and Africa, be screened for latent tuberculosis infections. Those who tested positive would still be allowed to enter the United States, but would have to undergo evaluation and antibiotic therapy before they could get a permanent residency card.</p>
        <p>The study was financed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Institute of Medicine is a private, nonprofit institution that provides advice on health policy under a Congressional charter to the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
