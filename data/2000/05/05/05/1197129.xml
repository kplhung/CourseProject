        <p>After a screening of ''Human Traffic'' at last year's Toronto Film Festival, the responses were split between those inspired to go hit a dance club and those driven to go home and hit their beds; the flurry of activity can be exhilarating or exhausting. Mostly it's exhilarating. Though ''Traffic'' is the kind of movie that's bound to draw a generational line in the sand, it needn't operate on so extreme a level. Yet the movie includes references that make it play to both sides of that line. One of the characters, for example, gets into an obsessive conversation about Travis Bickle with a cabby.</p>
        <p>A blissfully hedonistic film written and directed by Justin Kerrigan, ''Human Traffic'' has something singular: wastrel verve. It revels in its foolishness, and in its likable characters. It is a celebration of superficiality that functions as a pop gesture, so much so that Mr. Kerrigan may be embarrassed by it in a couple of years, or a couple of weeks, for that matter.</p>

        <p>After a screening of ''Human Traffic'' at last year's Toronto Film Festival, the responses were split between those inspired to go hit a dance club and those driven to go home and hit their beds; the flurry of activity can be exhilarating or exhausting. Mostly it's exhilarating. Though ''Traffic'' is the kind of movie that's bound to draw a generational line in the sand, it needn't operate on so extreme a level. Yet the movie includes references that make it play to both sides of that line. One of the characters, for example, gets into an obsessive conversation about Travis Bickle with a cabby.</p>
        <p>A blissfully hedonistic film written and directed by Justin Kerrigan, ''Human Traffic'' has something singular: wastrel verve. It revels in its foolishness, and in its likable characters. It is a celebration of superficiality that functions as a pop gesture, so much so that Mr. Kerrigan may be embarrassed by it in a couple of years, or a couple of weeks, for that matter.</p>
        <p>The five characters who are followed as they throw away 48 hours of their lives, put more effort into their partying than into any other area of their existences. And the movie is about that stage of life when partying has more allure than whatever minor employment one endures. They need the relief, if only to follow through on the ritual weekend clubbing that has come to define their lives. If they put this much effort into their workweeks -- well, why even think that way? Such a consideration seems utterly beyond them, at least until the end of the weekend, when the Ecstasy rush wears down. And when it does, ''Human Traffic'' is there, too.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerrigan's directing debut cribs from so many sources that he operates as a filmmaking pickpocket. The blast of energy that informs this petty larceny is completely his own, though, and the movie seems to skateboard through his stream of consciousness. He is just throwing out whatever comes to mind, and his enthusiasm generates excitement. There's a lack of reflection that seems honest because the characters are all in the moment, as is the movie.</p>
        <p>It makes sense that ''Human Traffic'' was released last year in England because it seems a companion piece to Guy Ritchie's earlier ''Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels''; both movies have absorbed the high-impact cutting of Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino and Danny Boyle, although ''Traffic'' is more studied about its tributes to other films and filmmakers. Mr. Kerrigan isn't overly polished, though.</p>
        <p>The splash of colors he employs has the eye-catching appeal of Skittles, though the candy tints seem to have been filtered through an artificially enhanced state of consciousness. The song score, which moves from techno to drum-and-bass to pop and all its variations, is skillfully woven through the picture. The music rhythms may make the picture a little Brit-centric, since Londoners have embraced Fat Boy Slim and Primal Scream more fully than Americans have.</p>
        <p>There's no sense of forced education in the movie; lessons come naturally, and with some trepidation. One of the couples make the transition from friends to lovers, while in another relationship an unnecessary bout of jealousy is smoothed out. The characters of ''Human Traffic'' hit the wall at the end of their debauch, which has the permanence of a tattoo out of a Cracker Jack box; it may be the first party picture in which the participants are happy to see Sunday night roll around. They're happy to be worn out; it makes the future less cloudy, and shows off the bright prospects for Mr. Kerrigan.</p>
        <p>''Human Traffic'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes drug and alcohol use and much frank conversation about sex.</p>
