        <p>Eric Perbos-Brinck gave up a promising management career last year at Promodes, the big French retailer, to start an Internet company called Bravonestor.com. He began in November with just 2 people, but already has 10 employees, with plans to hire 5 more in the next few weeks. To fill the jobs, Mr. Perbos-Brinck, 31, casts his net wide. One of his programmers is Moroccan. The designer of search engines is Senegalese. Both were studying in France as exchange students when Mr. Perbos-Brinck found them in a desperate search.</p>
        <p>''It's difficult and it's an issue,'' he said. ''One of my American investors said, 'This is war, so get anyone you can, anywhere.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Perbos-Brinck's polyglot staff would not draw a second glance in the United States, where the technology industry's ravenous demand for skilled workers has created a multinational, multicultural work force that includes many foreigners. But in Europe, his effort to find qualified help has collided with one of Europe's most divisive issues: immigration.</p>
        <p>The historic European antipathy toward immigrants has only sharpened in recent years. But with the European economy on the rebound, unemployment dropping from the extremely high levels of the mid-1990's and leaders clamoring to catch up with the United States in high technology, business faces a serious problem.</p>
        <p>Although job creation is gradually reducing overall unemployment rates, Europe finds itself in the curious situation of facing much higher unemployment than in the United States yet simultaneously suffering a critical shortage of skilled high-technology workers that is expected to worsen.</p>
        <p>The shortfall is particularly acute in Internet and Web-related businesses because European countries have not trained enough workers of their own with high-technology skills, a problem they are just beginning to address.</p>
        <p>As a result, even as overall opposition to immigration remains deeply entrenched, European governments are under pressure to find ways around these obstacles for at least some high-technology workers.</p>
        <p>In Britain, Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, proposed in March to relax rules on hiring skilled foreigners.</p>
        <p>In Germany, the chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, set off a stormy debate with a proposal to lift visa restrictions so that software experts from India and elsewhere could work in Germany. Even though the plan has not been approved, it has already attracted about 1,800 applications or requests for information.</p>
        <p>Pre-empting a final decision, cities like Frankfurt have begun to make exceptions to the rule that keeps foreign computer experts out.</p>
        <p>For Ernesto Schmitt, such openings in Europe's immigration net cannot come too soon. Mr. Schmitt, 28, set up Peoplesound.com, a London company that sells music over the Internet, and he uses all the tricks common to start-ups in the United States to find and keep talent, including the use of aggressive international headhunters and the promise of equity stakes in his company. Yet recently, when he discovered talented potential employees in South Africa, he decided he could not hire them. ''We did not want the pain of waiting six months for them to get visas,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The new economy is not waiting for governments to act on the shortage, which is leading to brawls for talented people. At big corporations, once the safe domain of career-oriented young Europeans, the best talent is being lured away by headhunters; other gifted young executives are leaving of their own accord, willingly forfeiting the security of the old economy for the rough-and-tumble risk of the new.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmitt, who grew up in Belgium, the son of a Uruguayan mother and German father, is perhaps typical of the new brand of European Web business leader. A self-styled frustrated disc jockey, he took the idea for his company from American models like MP3.com but rejiggered it for the European market. After attracting investors including Bernard Arnault, the wealthy chairman of the LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury goods group, he gave up the comfort of a secure job at the Boston Consulting Group to plunge into the new economy.</p>
        <p>Olivier Gravelle, 29, operating in sparsely furnished offices in Paris, recently set up the French unit of Wideyes.com, an online job search company much like Monster.com in the United States. Wideyes, founded in Sweden about a year ago, now employs 70 people there and in Britain, France and Spain. By the end of the year, after moving into Germany and Italy, it expects to have about 230 employees.</p>
        <p>''There is a war for talent,'' said Mr. Gravelle, who is French. Aggravating a basic shortage of skilled workers, upstart companies are acquiring established businesses -- he cites the successful hostile bid by the British wireless company Vodafone AirTouch for the German phone giant Mannesmann -- and needing new-style managers who are suited to the speed and complexity of electronic business.</p>
        <p>''People who come to us looking for jobs want mobility; they want to change jobs and to change geographically,'' Mr. Gravelle said. Young Europeans, he added, ''understand their duty to manage their skills and their careers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gravelle himself left a secure job at the consultants Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton in November to join Wideyes. He had met the Swedish founders of Wideyes earlier, while working in Scandinavia for the French bank Credit Lyonnais, before joining Booz Allen.</p>
        <p>Five years ago, that kind of mobility was the preserve of a small elite. Today it is so common that European companies are having to learn how to hold on to talented people, often employing means, like stock options, that not long ago were considered symptoms of very un-European greediness. Last month, for example, when Societe Generale in France announced the sale of shares in its online banking unit, Fimatex, it did so not least to enable it to retain talent by offering stock options, after the executive who started Fimatex was lured by stock options to a competitor.</p>
        <p>Consulting companies are among the main beneficiaries of the growth, as demand soars from corporations that are in need of skilled help.</p>
        <p>Marc A. Enjolras, a partner at Andersen Consulting in Paris, says Andersen will hire 250 people in France this year, increasing its staff to 2,750.</p>
        <p>To avoid losing people to Internet start-ups, Andersen France is introducing a number of retention measures already in use in the United States. Starting this year, Andersen's French employees will receive ''e-units,'' or shares in a $1 billion venture capital fund that the firm established in December. In France, as elsewhere, Andersen is also shortening the path to full partner by eliminating the rank of associate partner.</p>
        <p>Hugues Bertrand, director of the Center for the Study of Employment and Qualification in Marseille, a port city plagued by high unemployment and urban decay, said that in large measure ''companies that are successful are those that are creative and active in finding people.'' Much European job growth is coming not in technical professions, he added, but in traditional fields like education, career training and health and fitness services. ''Preparation need not be so much technical as social -- dealing with people, running an organization,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Many business leaders argue that the shortage of technology workers is real and that failure to address it will stunt Europe's revived growth.</p>
        <p>Bernard Vergnes, the 54-year-old chairman of Microsoft Europe, points to a study commissioned by Microsoft and published in March by the International Data Corporation that suggests that European demand for skilled professionals in telecommunications and computers will outstrip supply by as much as 13 percent over the next three years.</p>
        <p>Microsoft recently joined a group of Europe-based technology companies, including British Telecommunications, Nokia of Finland and Siemens of Germany, as well as IBM Europe, to urge greater cooperation between industry and governments in training skilled technology workers.</p>
        <p>Hardest hit by the shortages, according to the International Data study, will be Germany, which has the largest European economy and is the heart of European Internet business. Demand for talent in Germany is expected to exceed supply by as much as 15 percent, or more than 400,000 jobs.</p>
        <p>Touring a computer fair in March, Mr. Schroder, the German chancellor, responded to industry's demands for help by taking a chapter from United States policy and promising to offer temporary work permits -- a kind of German green card -- to as many as 20,000 skilled foreigners, notably from India and Eastern Europe. In return, German industry leaders promised to step up the training of domestic computer experts.</p>
        <p>The plan quickly drew fire from labor unions and opposition parties, who cited Germany's 4 million unemployed and 7.3 million foreigners, the highest number of immigrants in any European country. It also faced criticism from Mr. Schroder's own labor ministry. Gerd Andres, the ministry's No. 2 official, said the plan would only ''bring cheap labor into the country.''</p>
        <p>German cities have jumped the gun on this issue. In Frankfurt, the German financial capital and a major computer center, the local investment promotion agency, with the approval of local immigration officials, has persuaded six software companies from India to establish affiliates in the city.</p>
        <p>The agency's director, Hartmut Schwesinger, said recently that six more Indian companies were about to follow and that he was in discussions with 30 more.</p>
        <p>Still, given the Continent's distaste for foreigners, not everyone is convinced that foreign workers will come even if the German proposal is repeated across Europe.</p>
        <p>Andrew Milroy, who oversaw the shortages study for International Data, recalled talking with Sri Lankan and Indian software experts who said they would not be inclined to accept a European invitation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milroy recalled their saying, ''Europe is just not a welcoming place to live.''</p>
