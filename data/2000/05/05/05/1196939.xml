        <p>A noise that kept growing louder. A dark mass just clearing the rooftops. A fireball like a mushroom cloud. The Flannigans' house not there anymore, replaced by a pile of rubble as high as a kitchen window.  Great gouts of fire raining down, the reek of jet fuel, and things lying in the street that, in the light of the flames, slowly became recognizable as bodies.</p>
        <p>The residents of the Sherwood Park section of Lockerbie, Scotland, took the witness stand today in the trial of two Libyans accused of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103, and described a hellish scene -- exactly what each of them saw just after 7 p.m. on Dec. 21, 1988, when most of a Boeing 747 smashed down in their midst and exploded.</p>
        <p>All 259 people on the plane died. The 11 Lockerbie residents killed that night all lived at Nos. 11, 13, 14, 15 or 16 Sherwood Crescent, a group of row houses wiped out by the crash. Most of the survivors who testified today were their nearest neighbors, who leapt up from an episode of ''This Is Your Life'' to run outside and see those of others ending.</p>
        <p>But the prosecution in the case of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, the two former Libyan airline officials who are accused of being intelligence agents and of blowing up the plane in an act of terrorism, did not start so intimately. Rather, it focused the day's testimony like a zoom lens, starting from far off and moving in.</p>
        <p>The first witness was Stephen C. Teagle, a food plant manager who saw the blast from an empty highway, drove home, ate dinner and learned what it was from the late news. It led to witnesses like Jasmine Anne Bell, who dodged streaks of flaming jet fuel raining down on her brother's driveway, stepping ''back and back and back till I couldn't go any further because my back was against the wall.''</p>
        <p>The only witness the defense cross-examined was the last, Geoffrey John Carpenter, 56, who was then a police superintendent and a regional traffic specialist. He lived in Lockerbie and for some hours was the senior officer at the scene.</p>
        <p>The prosecution questioned him about the flying debris and huge crater he saw, and about how he had gotten roads cleared for fire engines and shelters set up for the homeless.</p>
        <p>In its turn, the defense asked several apparently disjointed questions. One was about whether it was possible to completely secure a crime scene when debris had rained down in a plume stretching for miles to the North Sea. He said it was not.</p>
        <p>A second was about how quickly journalists appeared on the scene. He estimated 90 minutes.</p>
        <p>A third was about how quickly ''American citizens'' began to arrive, particularly an F.B.I. team with ''modern, sophisticated equipment such as satellite systems and digital cameras,'' and more particularly an agent named Hal Hendershot. Mr. Carpenter said that he thought airline representatives arrived the next day, and that he later met F.B.I. agents with cameras of a type he had never seen. Agent Hendershot was the F.B.I.'s first liaison to the investigation, and federal agents often have satellite telephones and sophisticated cameras.</p>
        <p>The defense made no opening statement, so the point of the questions was unclear. But it has already announced that it may blame two Palestinian groups -- the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, based in Syria, and the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, based in the West Bank -- for the explosion. Today, in conversations with a French news agency, representatives of both groups denied responsibility.</p>
        <p>There have been suggestions in the past that a crucial piece of evidence against the Libyans, shreds of a bomb detonator, had been discovered too conveniently and could have been planted. The first question could have been directed at that.</p>
        <p>But much more complex theories about the crash of Pan Am 103 have made the conspiracy circuit for years, including one that says the F.B.I. and United States Navy Seals raced to the scene in a white helicopter to hunt for a box that contained a tape about the Iran-contra scandal or a drugs-for-hostages swap that would have that brought down the American government. Others ask whether the plane was shot down by a missile to cover a scandal.</p>
        <p>It appeared possible that the defense might be opening such routes to create doubts about the theory advanced in the indictment: that the two men packed a Toshiba boom box with explosives, stole luggage tags and checked the bomb through from Malta to New York, knowing that it would explode en route.</p>
        <p>Among the witnesses, it was Mrs. Bell who described the day's most horrifying image. She had just helped a couple who had fled their house barefoot find some shoes, and she and her 19-year-old son were looking for other injured residents.</p>
        <p>''I went up the driveway with the gentleman with the cut head,'' she said. ''And I looked down at something, and my son said 'What's that, Mom?'</p>
        <p>''My first reaction was: 'It's O.K., it's just meat.' But then it registered: it wasn't just meat.''</p>
        <p>The point of the hours of grisly testimony was not explained by the prosecution, nor questioned by the court or the defense.</p>
        <p>Legally, describing the terror and gore might have been skipped, because the defense does not dispute that the plane crashed and people died.</p>
        <p>But John P. Grant, a University of Glasgow law professor following the trial here, suggested that the prosecution was ''painting a picture of the crime.'' Doing so would be essential for a jury. There is none, but as he said, ''judges are human too.''</p>
        <p>The case is being heard by three judges because the defense maintained that a Scottish jury could not render a fair verdict. Since the trial is here on a Dutch air base that has been declared Scottish soil for the trial, and jurors could have been sequestered for more than a year, the prosecution agreed.</p>
        <p>Witness after witness described the shock of the first blast and the horror when they realized that they were still in danger. Ian James Wood, 37, a tire worker who lived a block away, said it was ''raining glass, small pieces from the shattered windows on the street.'' William Wilson, 56, described ''a mass of debris and gas balls coming down'' as he left work, an engine flying away overhead and ''pieces of metal and stuff coming through the roofs around us.''</p>
        <p>His colleague in the motor-fitting shop was Thomas B. Flannigan of 16 Sherwood Crescent, who had gone home half an hour earlier. Mr. Wilson never saw him again. ''I went by his house next day,'' he said. ''I saw his car and carport. That was there.  The house was gone.''</p>
        <p>Almost all described the initial explosion on Sherwood Crescent as a mushroom cloud. ''A big explosion like an atomic bomb that you see on the telly,'' said Kevin Anderson, a plasterer who lived more than three miles away. He said there was ''no noise for about two minutes.''</p>
        <p>''And then I heard things falling,'' he said. ''I heard this screaming. And the cockpit landed in the field opposite the house, about 100 yards away.'' Stunned, he ran for his father-in-law and a flashlight, and they came back and climbed inside ''to see what we could do, to see if anybody was alive,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I could see the pilots,'' he said. ''But where it was snapped off, it was just wreckage and bodies.''</p>
        <p>Stuart Kirkpatrick, 38, also reacted bravely. His house was a half a mile from Sherwood Crescent, and he went outside, felt the heat from the fireball and saw ''a shadow coming'' even though it was night. He shut the door, and when it opened again, ''there was nothing but fragments and dust and stuff'' where two houses had been. He heard screams, ran across and found ''Mrs. Ramsden's house -- only the kitchen was left, and rubble up to the height of the windowsills.''</p>
        <p>''I broke the window, and she wouldn't come out without the dog,'' he said. ''I lifted it out to one of the boys, then lifted her out.''</p>
        <p>''It's hard to believe,'' he added, ''that she was in the kitchen and it was the only part of the house that was whole. She's a very lucky lady.''</p>
