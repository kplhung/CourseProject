        <p>The Boston Herald suspended its consumer affairs columnist this week after disagreements over a series of articles about a major New England bank, prompting a protest petition within the newsroom and some dismay outside the paper, particularly among black journalists.</p>
        <p>The columnist, Robin Washington, 43, has said publicly that he believed that he was demoted to general assignment reporter last week and then suspended indefinitely without pay on Sunday because of pressure from the bank, the FleetBoston Financial Corporation, an advertiser and lender.</p>
        <p>Mr. Washington's articles underscored the higher fee structure facing hundreds of thousands of former BankBoston customers after its $16 billion dollar merger last year with Fleet Financial, which created the nation's eighth-largest bank.</p>
        <p>Mr. Washington will no longer comment on the case, saying that he is barred from speaking by The Herald's grievance procedure. But his supporters believe that his editors were incensed by his initial public remarks.</p>
        <p>Patrick J. Purcell, the newspaper's publisher, did not return telephone calls about the case. The two senior editors also would not comment, saying it was an internal disciplinary matter.</p>
        <p>The tabloid newspaper's sole public comment came in an aggrieved statement released by Mr. Purcell on April 27. The statement also noted that the case was an internal matter. But the publisher said he was ''extremely disturbed'' by the staff petition over the coverage, which he defended as solely a matter of news judgment.</p>
        <p>''It's ridiculous to accuse us of being influenced by 'advertisers and business interests' in this case, Fleet/BankBoston, when over the course of three weeks at least three stories appeared regarding increased fees resulting from the merger, including one on the front page,'' Mr. Purcell said. ''These stories prompted coverage on the business pages by other reporters.''</p>
        <p>The bank acknowledges having contacted the newspaper twice to complain about the coverage, but said that in both cases it was over Mr. Washington's reporting methods. James Mahoney, a spokesman for the bank, said one case involved a close friend of Mr. Washington who called as a customer and another when Mr. Washington interviewed FleetBoston employees in a coffee shop that they frequent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mahoney would not detail the specifics of his complaints but said that at no time had any bank advertising been discussed, much less threatened.</p>
        <p>But 75 of The Herald's 300 employees represented by the Newspaper Guild of Greater Boston signed a petition protesting ''the apparent unethical influence of advertisers and business interests'' in the FleetBoston coverage.</p>
        <p>''People here are perplexed and troubled by this sequence of events,'' said Tom Mashberg, the newspaper guild's shop steward for editorial employees at The Herald. ''They believe strongly that this is a good newspaper with no tradition of backing down to anyone. They want to uphold that tradition and to have this situation resolved soon.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mashberg said the petition was intended for internal discussion and not to air dirty laundry. Under the contract, the newspaper has 30 days to schedule a meeting to discuss Mr. Washington's grievance, filed in late April.</p>
        <p>Aside from the petition, a group of 50 people picketed the building on Tuesday to show support for Mr. Washington in a rally organized by the Boston chapter of the National Association of Black Journalists. Mr. Washington, who has been at The Herald for four years, including two in the consumer post, is the president of the Boston chapter and has worked for various news organizations for 23 years.</p>
        <p>His suspension drew attention to the fact that he is one of only 4 blacks among some 235 editorial employees there and the only news writer. The other three blacks include a sports writer and two copy editors.</p>
        <p>''To remove the one and only African-American voice from the news pages makes a bad situation even worse,'' said Will Sutton, president of the National Association of Black Journalists and a deputy managing editor of The News &amp; Observer in Raleigh, N.C.</p>
        <p>''It is a combination of pulling an aggressive reporter off a story, with the appearance of bowing to pressure, and poor diversity in the newsroom when it comes to African-American journalists covering a city where there are a lot of African-American residents,'' Mr. Sutton said.</p>
        <p>The association issued a statement saying that Mr. Washington should be reinstated and noted that it would monitor The Herald to ensure that it added more African-Americans to its staff.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 6, 2000, Saturday  An article yesterday about the Boston Herald's suspension of a consumer affairs columnist, Robin Washington, misstated his account of the cause. Mr. Washington has said publicly that he believes he was originally demoted after a bank, the FleetBoston Financial Corporation, complained about his columns on its fee structure. He said he was then suspended after asserting publicly that the bank influenced coverage. He did not say he believed he was suspended because of pressure from the bank.</p>
