        <p>Cafe Nicholson, for half a century one of Manhattan's most idiosyncratic, eccentric restaurants, lives again. It has a newer, shorter name:  Nicholson. It has a new owner and chef, Patrick Woodside, who also owns CamaJe Bistro and Lounge in Greenwich Village.</p>
        <p>But aside from a new gilt ceiling panel in place of the old skylight, the restaurant looks much the same as the old place, where artists, socialites and bohemians gathered to eat under the indulgent gaze of Johnny Nicholson, who sold his namesake in January 1999.</p>

        <p>Cafe Nicholson, for half a century one of Manhattan's most idiosyncratic, eccentric restaurants, lives again. It has a newer, shorter name:  Nicholson. It has a new owner and chef, Patrick Woodside, who also owns CamaJe Bistro and Lounge in Greenwich Village.</p>
        <p>But aside from a new gilt ceiling panel in place of the old skylight, the restaurant looks much the same as the old place, where artists, socialites and bohemians gathered to eat under the indulgent gaze of Johnny Nicholson, who sold his namesake in January 1999.</p>
        <p>With its parquet floors, painted wall tiles and antique settees, Nicholson feels like a room in a remote corner of a sprawling chateau. It doesn't take a huge leap of the imagination to see the ghosts of Tennessee Williams or Truman Capote, old regulars at the cafe, which is poised at the approach to the upper roadway of the Queensboro Bridge. It is a little difficult, on the other hand, to imagine what kind of food might come out of the kitchen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Woodside has opted for three tasting menus of four, six and eight courses. The food is French, imaginative and romantic. Portions are small. The four-course menu starts with oysters in shallot jelly, or white asparagus accompanied by a caviar napoleon. The main course can be either cod with pistachio in a light bearnaise sauce, or loin of lamb with yellow squash flan and nero sauce.</p>
        <p>The eight-course dinner includes lamb carpaccio with mint and basil glaze, belgian endive sauteed with cured goose liver, and lobster Souvarov, a casserole enriched with chestnuts, morels, spring onions and truffle essence. There's the distinct aroma of old-fashioned indulgence wafting over the entire menu.</p>
        <p>This may be the only restaurant in Manhattan serving crystallized rose petals with a rosewater granite. It is certainly the only one where the dish seems absolutely at home.</p>
        <p>Nicholson, 323 East 58th Street, Manhattan; (212) 355-6769. Prix fixe dinners are $64 (four courses), $78 (six courses) and $98 (eight courses).</p>
