        <p>The number of United Nations peacekeepers held hostage by rebels in Sierra Leone rose to at least 92 today. An ominously tense calm followed four days of intensifying clashes between the peacekeepers and fighters from the insurgent Revolutionary United Front.</p>
        <p>Although the shooting had temporarily stopped in the West African country, additional United Nations troops were reported at risk. Reports from the field indicated that the rebels may have captured some peacekeepers from a Zambian contingent in Kambia, near Guinea. A United Nations official said their fate was uncertain after a firefight on Wednesday that ran into the night.</p>
        <p>The latest count of hostages, up sharply from the figure of 49 issued on Wednesday, includes 23 soldiers from an Indian battalion who were surrounded at Kuiva in the east, another United Nations official said. The United Nations mission in Freetown also reported having lost radio contact with an undisclosed number of other units.</p>
        <p>Confronted with the crisis, Secretary General Kofi Annan flew back from Paris today to decide what action to take next. Mr. Annan told reporters that he had spoken to the leaders of Algeria, Burkina Faso, Liberia, Libya, Mali, Nigeria and Togo about interceding with the rebels' leader, Foday Sankoh. Mr. Annan said that President Charles Taylor of Liberia had talked to Mr. Sankoh and that Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya was also sending an envoy.</p>
        <p>Other discussions, Mr. Annan said, are under way with the United States and Britain about transporting reinforcements to Sierra Leone. He said he also met the French before leaving Paris.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan spoke after the Security Council had adopted a statement that condemned the attacks on the peacekeepers and held Mr. Sankoh responsible for making his followers release the hostages.</p>
        <p>A senior official at the Pentagon said the United States would ''most likely'' provide transportation for three battalions of peacekeepers from Bangladesh, India and Jordan, a contingent totaling 2,000 who are scheduled to arrive next month in Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Pentagon, Kenneth H. Bacon, said the United States was ''looking at a range of ways'' to support the peacekeeping and would ''consider very carefully'' a United Nations transportation request.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bacon said there was no possibility of sending American soldiers to become peacekeepers in Sierra Leone. If American transports are used, American troops would have to help secure the airport to ensure that the aircraft and crews were not attacked.</p>
        <p>Four peacekeepers from a Kenyan battalion are missing and presumed dead after rebels attacked their post in the central town of Magburaka. That is fewer than the seven initially reported dead on Wednesday by the head of peacekeeping operations, Bernard Miyet, based on a flurry of initial reports from the field. At the time, 49 peacekeepers were believed to have been taken hostage.</p>
        <p>The four Kenyans are technically missing, a spokeswoman, Marie Okabe, said, because ''no bodies have been recovered yet.''</p>
        <p>At least eight other troops have been reported wounded in clashes with the rebels. Since the beginning of the week, one peacekeeper, an Indian, has been released.</p>
        <p>In Freetown, Mr. Sankoh denied that his fighters were holding peacekeepers and faulted the United Nations for starting the fighting.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the mission in Sierra Leone, Philip Windslow, said Mr. Sankoh had ''stated categorically that he is not holding anybody and, furthermore, he has stated that the U.N. people started the fighting, both statements which are untrue.''</p>
        <p>''We know the R.U.F. is holding a substantial number of U.N. personnel,'' Mr. Windslow told Agence France-Presse. ''These are military observers, peacekeepers and some civilians, and it is clear these people are being held against their will.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan said regional leaders were trying to persuade Mr. Sankoh to free the hostages and end the crisis. He named Presidents Blaise Compoare of Burkina Faso, Alpha Konare of Mali and Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, as well as Mr. Taylor and Colonel Qaddafi.</p>
        <p>''They have tried to impress on him the seriousness of the situation and the fact that he is placing himself in a very difficult situation and he's already isolated and it's going to get worse,'' Mr. Annan said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sankoh was given a ministerial post in a coalition government last year as part of a power-sharing arrangement to settle Sierra Leone's long civil war, which broke out in March 1991. The new fighting has prompted concern that Mr. Sankoh may want the precarious peace to collapse so he can seize power.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Sankoh had promised free movement for the United Nations peacekeepers, he has denied them access to areas controlled by his fighters, in part because they contain diamonds that are smuggled to finance the insurgency and, by some accounts, to enrich Mr. Sankoh. He has also refused to let the peacekeepers disarm his fighters, who are believed to number 45,000.</p>
        <p>The leader's house in Freetown was reported surrounded on Wednesday by soldiers from the United Nations mission, apparently in a standoff. But Ms. Okabe played down the significance today, saying the United Nations forces have been providing security for members of the government, including Mr. Sankoh.</p>
        <p>''He is not under house arrest,'' she said, although the movements of ''various people'' in the capital are restricted.</p>
        <p>About 8,700 peacekeepers and observers from more than 30 countries are in Sierra Leone. The Security Council authorized on Feb. 7 an expansion of the mission to a maximum of 11,100 troops, including the 260 military observers who are already deployed. The mission was created to replace a Nigerian-led force of African troops that had been fighting to stop the rebels and reimpose order.</p>
