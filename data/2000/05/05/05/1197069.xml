        <p>'Terra Cotta Sculptures'</p>
        <p>Zabriskie Gallery</p>
        <p>41 East 57th Street</p>
        <p>Through June 10</p>
        <p>The suave, mostly small terra cotta figures made by Alexander Archipenko (1887-1964) during the 1930's deal with the female form, from solid, sensuous torso to near-abstraction in which open spaces play a role. By the time he did these figures, this Russian-born artist was living in the United States and had long been recognized as a strong innovator in early-20th-century sculpture. He was a pioneer translator of Cubist ideas into 3-D and an experimenter who worked with architectural elements and concave shapes that departed from modeled mass.</p>
        <p>Archipenko turned to terra cotta as a medium during the Depression, because it was cheaper than marble or stone and had proved itself as a material widely used in architecture for decoration and detailing. He finished the surfaces in elegant ways, sometimes adding colored elements and inlays to the basic structure and always polishing the ''skin'' to a high degree.</p>

        <p>The suave, mostly small terra cotta figures made by Alexander Archipenko (1887-1964) during the 1930's deal with the female form, from solid, sensuous torso to near-abstraction in which open spaces play a role. By the time he did these figures, this Russian-born artist was living in the United States and had long been recognized as a strong innovator in early-20th-century sculpture. He was a pioneer translator of Cubist ideas into 3-D and an experimenter who worked with architectural elements and concave shapes that departed from modeled mass.</p>
        <p>Archipenko turned to terra cotta as a medium during the Depression, because it was cheaper than marble or stone and had proved itself as a material widely used in architecture for decoration and detailing. He finished the surfaces in elegant ways, sometimes adding colored elements and inlays to the basic structure and always polishing the ''skin'' to a high degree.</p>
        <p>The loveliest work here is the simple elongated ''Female Torso'' (1948). Two feet high, of cast terra cotta in a pinkish tone, it stands in slightly contraposto position. It could have been cued by Cycladic sculpture, one of the many cultures, including African, from which Archipenko drew.</p>
        <p>He did not lack for humor: ''Woman in Fur'' (1938), an Art Deco-ish seated torso in a lustrous sienna color, is draped in a grayish garment whose roughened surfaces and long rippling lines frame her nudity, giving her the look of a lady on the town. And ''Josephine Bonaparte'' (1935) is a long, graceful cascade of gown, accented by patches of roughened stone, that sweeps fluently to the ground from a disproportionately small but regally held head and shoulders.</p>
        <p>All is not lightness and grace, however. Some works in the show -- the first to exhibit Archipenko's terra cottas as a specific group -- seem positively clunky, like the large ''Family Life'' (1935) and ''Espagnola'' (1942). He is at his best in the beautifully modeled torsos of idealized female figures that reach for the spiritual essence of human form.</p>
