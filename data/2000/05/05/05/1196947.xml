        <p>LOUISE SPIERS, wearing polka dots and a tired frown, is sitting in a tiny borrowed office at Manhattan Family Court, ignoring the vase of spring flowers on the desk behind her. Once an avid gardener and flower lover, Ms. Spiers, who counsels the families of murder victims, does not have the heart for indulging in flora anymore.</p>
        <p>That is what happens, she says, when murder becomes the epicenter of your personal and professional universe: you forget how to smell the roses.</p>
        <p>The same goes for music, a passion she thought she might build a career on, a self-taught skill that earned her a college scholarship that she spurned, to marry and have a child. Ever since that child, Denise, was murdered by a Brooklyn drug addict for the contents of her pocketbook -- stabbed more than 20 times and left to die on an apartment building walkway -- Ms. Spiers has not felt like touching a piano.</p>
        <p>''It brings back too many memories,'' says Ms. Spiers, who directed her daughter's choir. ''Murder is like a pebble thrown into a family: first comes the splash, then come the ripples, and they're never ending.''</p>
        <p>The bad memories are why Ms. Spiers, one of 11 counselors in the citywide Families of Homicide Victims Program operated by a nonprofit agency, Victim Services Inc., expected to get a call last month when murders of livery-cab drivers became epidemic. She knew a ''recovered'' client of hers was about to experience the ripple effect, about to be forced into a setback.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Ms. Spiers counseled the mother of a slain livery-cab driver, worked her through the mother's rage at her son's murderer, eased her through her anger at her son's employers, supported her in her disappointment that so obvious a safety feature as a $300 partition had not been installed in her son's car. Now the woman is back in weekly counseling sessions.</p>
        <p>''The murders in the news reopened a lot of old wounds,'' says Ms. Spiers, who could not disclose the client's identity because of Victim Services' confidentiality policy. (The agency maintains a funeral fund for taxi drivers killed on duty and has contacted the families of all the recently slain livery drivers.)</p>
        <p>''After taking a big step forward and moving on through the grieving process, now she's taken 10 steps back,'' she adds about her client. ''She's having a difficult time with all of it, especially with the fact that the partitions were supposed to be put in back then before her son was killed, and it turns out it still hadn't been done, and now other families are going through the same pain she did when maybe it didn't have to be that way.''</p>
        <p>Pain, Ms. Spiers adds, is the operative word here.</p>
        <p>NOT that she would ever resort to such a smarmy New Age cliche, but when Ms. Spiers tells a client, in so many words, ''I feel your pain,'' she's not just sympathizing. ''I don't usually bring up what happened to me, because it's not really professional, but sometimes they seem to know, and if they ask, I tell them. When they see I've walked that walk, too, it changes things. It's like we're all members of this exclusive club: one we don't want to be members of.''</p>
        <p>But why then does Ms. Spiers, an executive secretary for a cosmetics company before her daughter's stabbing in 1984, choose to immerse herself in that club as a victim-turned-victims' advocate at an agency that sends out some 600 consolation/information letters (one to the family of every homicide victim in the five boroughs) each year?</p>
        <p>Because counseling saved her life after her 27-year-old daughter's was lost.</p>
        <p>''I thought I could get through it on my own, that if I could bury my daughter, I was tough enough to handle anything, but I was losing my mind,'' says Ms. Spiers, who quit her job to raise her daughter's 4-year-old son, William. Before turning to Victim Services, Ms. Spiers, who lives with her husband in the Flatlands section of Brooklyn, had contacted a state agency and was turned down for assistance.</p>
        <p>Though the agency later apologized, the damage was done: ''I felt like I'd been through a second victimization,'' Ms. Spiers said. ''Thank God there was a homicide victims program in Brooklyn.''</p>
        <p>Five years later, Ms. Spiers, at the urging of her own counselors, began doing volunteer work for Victim Services, which serves 200,000 clients (90,000 of them domestic violence victims). In 1990, she played a significant role in the pilot program that gave families the opportunity to appear before the parole boards of their relative's murderer.</p>
        <p>When she learned there was no Families of Homicide Victims Program in Staten Island, she started one. Two years ago, she was hired as a full-time counselor. Not bad for a woman who, 15 years ago, was so paralyzed by grief and guilt -- if only she never left Pennsylvania for New York, if only she and her husband and grandson had not gone to the beach that Labor Day weekend her daughter died -- she could barely drag herself out of bed.</p>
        <p>''I'm firmly convinced I'm in the right place,'' she says, fingering a gold necklace that spells out ''Navy Mom,'' a Mother's Day gift from her grandson, who graduated from boot camp last year. ''When you lose someone to murder, you spend a lot of time asking yourself why. Maybe, if I'm helping somebody else get through that pain, then Denise's death wasn't in vain.''</p>
