        <p>The head of Canada's central bank, Gordon Thiessen, 62, said he would retire in January after completing his seven-year term. The Bank of Canada's directors will recommend a successor, but approval rests with the federal cabinet and especially the finance minister, Paul Martin, who said he regretted Mr. Thiessen's decision not to seek reappointment. During Mr. Thiessen's tenure, the central bank has kept Canada's inflation rate within a target range of 1 to 3 percent, but the value of the Canadian dollar has tumbled.</p>
