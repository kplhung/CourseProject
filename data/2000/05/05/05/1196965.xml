        <p>There is the past and there is the future, which Marlon St. Julien will be acutely aware of when he moves Curule into the gate for the 126th Kentucky Derby on Saturday. When he takes the reigns for the Dubai-based Godolphin stable, St. Julien will be the first African-American jockey to ride in America's most famous race since 1921.</p>
        <p>Growing up as an honor student in Lafayette, La., St. Julien, the son of an elementary school teacher, was drilled by his mother on the rich history of African-Americans in the Derby. The 5-foot-2-inch, 110-pound St. Julien rattles off the fact that black jockeys won 15 of the first 28 Derbys and that a pair of black 15-year-olds are the two youngest jockeys to win the race: Alonzo Clayton aboard Azra in 1892 and James Perkins on Halma in 1895. The last African-American to ride in the race was Henry King, aboard Planet.</p>

        <p>There is the past and there is the future, which Marlon St. Julien will be acutely aware of when he moves Curule into the gate for the 126th Kentucky Derby on Saturday. When he takes the reigns for the Dubai-based Godolphin stable, St. Julien will be the first African-American jockey to ride in America's most famous race since 1921.</p>
        <p>Growing up as an honor student in Lafayette, La., St. Julien, the son of an elementary school teacher, was drilled by his mother on the rich history of African-Americans in the Derby. The 5-foot-2-inch, 110-pound St. Julien rattles off the fact that black jockeys won 15 of the first 28 Derbys and that a pair of black 15-year-olds are the two youngest jockeys to win the race: Alonzo Clayton aboard Azra in 1892 and James Perkins on Halma in 1895. The last African-American to ride in the race was Henry King, aboard Planet.</p>
        <p>''It's very important to be me, and I am very aware of it,'' St. Julien said today. Still, the 28-year-old conceded he would be aboard the weaker part of the Godolphin entry on a colt that won just once in four lifetime races and, together with China Visit, has been listed as a 50-1 long shot. Still, St. Julien said it did not matter.</p>
        <p>This is his first Derby. Just as he did by winning the 1997 riders' title at Lone Star Park, and by starting at nearby Ellis Park and working up to Keeneland and Churchill Downs, this ride on a long shot will mean more to St. Julien later.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to tell what the horse can do; I've never been on him,'' he said. ''But what this means to me is the world. I am proud and my mother is proud of the significance of getting on him.</p>
        <p>''But practically, this is an experience I need. Next year, when somebody is looking for a Derby jockey I'm going to be in consideration.''</p>
        <p>Wait Till Next Year</p>
        <p>The trainer Jerry Hollendorfer saw his Derby dreams dashed again today when his colt Globalize was kicked by his escort pony, sustained a deep gash in his left hind leg and had to be scratched. Globalize had just finished a gallop under Mike Smith when he was kicked.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Hollendorfer, who is based in Northern California, saddled the leading contender Event of the Year, but the colt sustained a slab fracture of his knee two weeks before the race.</p>
        <p>Hollendorfer is perennially near the top of the national purse earnings list but has yet to compete in the Derby.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I'm jinxed,'' he said. ''I don't believe in that kind of stuff. This is something that just happened, an unfortunate accident.''</p>
        <p>Shuffling the Deck</p>
        <p>The fact that Globalize has been scratched undercuts some of the strategy of Wednesday's post-position draw. Hollendorfer's colt was supposed to break from the No. 1 hole on the rail, but now his departure means that every other horse moves inside one post.</p>
        <p>Todd Pletcher, the trainer of More Than Ready, selected No. 10, for example, so his colt would be among the second to last to load -- starters stagger the loading. Now More Than Ready will be loaded a little sooner.</p>
        <p>The big winner may be the unpredictable early favorite, Fusaichi Pegasus. Instead of being sandwiched in No. 16, in the auxiliary gate, the colt now enjoys a gap between the main gate and the 15th spot -- or first gate -- in the auxiliary.</p>
        <p>Wheelaway Is Ready</p>
        <p>Only Wheelaway, a 30-1 shot coupled with Deputy Warlock and Ronton, worked today, a short blowout that helped assuage the worry of the trainer John Kimmel. The late-running third-place finisher in the Blue Grass worked a slow six furlongs last Saturday on a track that the New York-based trainer believed was too heavy. The Unbridled progeny went a swift three furlongs today in 343/5 seconds.</p>
