        <p>''Michael Jordan to the Max'' is a big, loud, expensive statement of the proposition that the Chicago Bulls guard was the greatest basketball player of all time. That nobody is likely to dispute the assertion is both the film's reason for being and its principal flaw. Until his retirement two years ago, Mr. Jordan dominated his sport as no one else has, and he continues to be a ubiquitous media presence, lending his fame, his face and his soft, deep voice to worthy causes like batteries, long-distance calling plans and Gatorade. No other individual athlete -- perhaps no other individual -- could so comfortably occupy the superhuman Imax format, but the format and the purposeful blandness of the script make Mr. Jordan seem remote, more icon than human being.</p>
        <p>Sports documentaries usually trade in either nostalgia or revelation. But Mr. Jordan controls himself and his public image much too carefully to permit any of the latter, and his accomplishments are so recent and so familiar, that they lack the bittersweet sepia flicker of, say, HBO's recent Bill Russell biography. There are no surprises here.</p>

        <p>''Michael Jordan to the Max'' is a big, loud, expensive statement of the proposition that the Chicago Bulls guard was the greatest basketball player of all time. That nobody is likely to dispute the assertion is both the film's reason for being and its principal flaw. Until his retirement two years ago, Mr. Jordan dominated his sport as no one else has, and he continues to be a ubiquitous media presence, lending his fame, his face and his soft, deep voice to worthy causes like batteries, long-distance calling plans and Gatorade. No other individual athlete -- perhaps no other individual -- could so comfortably occupy the superhuman Imax format, but the format and the purposeful blandness of the script make Mr. Jordan seem remote, more icon than human being.</p>
        <p>Sports documentaries usually trade in either nostalgia or revelation. But Mr. Jordan controls himself and his public image much too carefully to permit any of the latter, and his accomplishments are so recent and so familiar, that they lack the bittersweet sepia flicker of, say, HBO's recent Bill Russell biography. There are no surprises here.</p>
        <p>The film, which opens today at Sony Theaters Lincoln Square, is more like an infomercial in which the pitchman is also the product. He may be the greatest athlete in history, but Mr. Jordan's own history is given surprisingly short shrift. His brief, brilliant sojourn at the University of North Carolina is represented by a sound bite and a single still photograph, and the six world championships he won with the Bulls exist mainly as banners hanging from the rafters of the team's home court. In the future, somebody remarks, parents will tell their children about the glory that was Michael, but children who missed, say, the Bulls' first three championships will have to learn about them elsewhere. Mr. Jordan's career is telescoped into his triumphant valedictory season two springs ago, perhaps because in previous years nobody had thought to record his exploits with Imax-compatible equipment.</p>
        <p>Athletic greatness is either too mysterious or too obvious to be explained, but a number of earnest, knowledgeable broadcasters and coaches pop up to analyze the Jordan mystique, and the man himself offers his thoughts on the importance of hard work, optimism and ''mental attitude'' in achieving your goals. Meanwhile, Laurence Fishburne narrates the Bulls' spring playoff campaign of 1998. He sounds a little bored, even as his rumbling tones and dramatic background music strive to turn the Indiana Pacers and the Utah Jazz into something other than the patsies history knows them to be.</p>
        <p>The Imax format, with its enveloping images and rib-cage-rattling sound, is wired for sublimity, and Mr. Jordan, even in twilight, was capable of feats that, projected on an enormous screen, seem to transcend all human possibility. But if memory serves, they were no less impressive when viewed on the small screen from a bar stool or the living room couch. And what is inevitably missing from this tribute is the sense of the drama, the sheer improvisational genius, that Mr. Jordan brought to every game he played. Blown up to 50 feet tall, he seems, curiously, smaller than life.</p>
        <p>''Michael Jordan to the Max'' is a vivid reminder of what it cannot show: Michael Jordan ''in the moment,'' bending time and space to his disciplined, creative will. It's an entertaining, intermittently thrilling 45 minutes, but nothing compared to what the man himself could do in 48.</p>
