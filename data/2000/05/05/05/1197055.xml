        <p>A singular element of Cardinal John O'Connor's legacy, it seems, may be his ability to win admirers in unexpected corners.</p>
        <p>One admirer described himself as an atheist. Another found himself on the receiving end of a public quarrel over abortion. A third remembered the wariness among many Jews 16 years ago, when a bishop from an old coal-mine city in Pennsylvania was chosen to lead the Archdiocese of New York.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the day after the cardinal died of cancer at the age of 80, they and many others expressed unabashed affection for someone who challenged their various perceptions of who he was and what he believed in.</p>
        <p>He was more than simply a prelate opposed to abortion and homosexuality, said Nat Hentoff, a self-described atheist who spent a lot of time with the cardinal while researching a book about his tenure. He passionately supported labor unions, Mr. Hentoff said, committed himself to fighting poverty and knew full well the suffering caused by AIDS. He not only visited the afflicted, he cleaned their bed pans.</p>
        <p>''This was hardly a conservative,'' Mr. Hentoff said.</p>
        <p>As governor, Mario M. Cuomo was a target of Cardinal O'Connor's diatribes against Roman Catholic politicians who support abortion rights; the cardinal even refused to rule out the possibility of excommunication for such leaders. But Mr. Cuomo said that he makes a distinction between a philosophical dispute and the essence of a man -- a man, he said, who visited Mr. Cuomo's dying mother without ever mentioning it to him.</p>
        <p>''Cardinal O'Connor was surely the Vatican's favorite conservative dogmatist,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''But he was also one of the greatest progressives that we've had. And above all that, he was a priest -- a real priest.''</p>
        <p>Then there is the Rabbi Jack Bemporad, the director of the Center for Inter-Religious Understanding in New Jersey. He remembered the trepidation among some Jews upon hearing that the successor to Cardinal Terence Cooke had likened abortion to the Holocaust. That sense of uncertainty vanished from many as Cardinal O'Connor proved to be deeply committed to improving relations between the faiths.</p>
        <p>''He felt our suffering,'' Rabbi Bemporad said.</p>
        <p>When Cardinal John O'Connor came to New York in 1984, he seemed to fit the billing that preceded him: that of a former rear admiral in the Navy, a staunch defender of the Vietnam War, a loyal lieutenant of Pope John Paul II. He introduced himself to a traditionally liberal city by speaking out against abortion, homosexuality and the politicians with whom he disagreed. To many he appeared to be a man comfortable in a miter.</p>
        <p>Msgr. Philip J. Murnion, the director of the National Pastoral Life Center, a Manhattan office that conducts research for the church, said that Cardinal O'Connor embraced his primary responsibility, which is to teach. But his greatest joy, the monsignor said, seemed to come from his pastoral duties: quietly visiting the sick, comforting the family of Amadou Diallo, attending daily morning Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral.</p>
        <p>''He loved the pastoral side,'' Monsignor Murnion said. ''He loved it because it's so much more satisfying for a priest than to be holding up traditions and asserting norms.''</p>
        <p>Edward I. Koch, the former mayor, found himself arguing with Cardinal O'Connor over proposed legislation banning the discrimination of people based on their sexual orientation. That public dispute wound up laying the groundwork for a close personal friendship between the two men.</p>
        <p>''What was extraordinary about him was his willingness to say what had to be said insofar as Catholic teachings were concerned and at the same time demonstrate extraordinary compassion for the sinner,'' Mr. Koch said. ''I'm not Catholic -- everybody knows I'm Jewish and very proud of my faith -- but I loved him as a brother and a mentor. I will miss him.''</p>
        <p>But there were those who still found it hard to look beyond some of Cardinal O'Connor's positions. Eric Sawyer, a founding member of Act-Up New York, said that the cardinal ''did an admirable thing'' by opening archdiocesan hospitals to people with AIDS and developing skilled nursing for those with AIDS. ''But he also caused a huge amount of harm to youth in New York City,'' Mr. Sawyer added, ''by leading a campaign to deny condom distribution in New York City high schools and by combating safe sex education programs.''</p>
        <p>In some ways, Cardinal O'Connor's career might suggest a pattern of conflicts. He opposed homosexuality, but sought to ease the suffering of AIDS victims. He opposed premarital sex, but supported diocesan outreach programs for single parents. He often revealed a conservative political bent, but was an outspoken supporter of labor unions.</p>
        <p>He once stoutly defended the government's involvement in the Vietnam War -- he later regretted that position -- but became an advocate for the beatification of Dorothy Day, the pacifist and co-founder of the Catholic Worker movement.</p>
        <p>''I think he saw Dorothy Day as an example: a single mother, making her way in life with a child, someone who had an abortion, had a couple of relationships,'' said Jane Sammon, a longtime volunteer at the Catholic Worker's offices on the Lower East Side. ''I think that story appealed to him.''</p>
        <p>In fact, traits that seem to flirt with contradiction were classic O'Connor, those who knew him say. ''People forget: he was the Irish son of workers, true to the traditional Catholic social teachings,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''It seems his good positive social works never went mentioned.''</p>
        <p>The cardinal endeared himself to those of other faiths. He traveled to Eastern Europe with Billy Graham, the Protestant evangelist. He won the trust of many of the city's black ministers by speaking out against police brutality.</p>
        <p>Among those expressing great admiration for the cardinal in the wake of his death were the leaders of various Jewish organizations: the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Congress, the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York. It was not always that way.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Bemporad said that there had been concern about Cardinal O'Connor's position on Judeo-Christian relations; ''He was an unknown quantity.'' But the cardinal, he said, sought out the counsel of various Jewish leaders.</p>
        <p>''He came here and he knew he was in a community with 2.5 million Jews,'' he said. ''He was an insomniac, and he would sit up night after night reading about the Jews. He became very knowledgeable about Jewish history and teachings.''</p>
        <p>The cardinal, he said, became outspoken in his denunciation of anti-Semitism and his support for stronger ties between the Catholic and Jewish religions.</p>
        <p>In the hours before the cardinal's death on Wednesday night, people in the churches and on the streets of New York offered their own eulogies that reflected the prelate's broad legacy.</p>
        <p>Outside St. John the Evangelist Church on Manhattan's East Side, a retired salesman named John Kelliher said that the cardinal ''taught morality the way Catholics teach it -- without flinching.'' Meanwhile, a few blocks away, a bicycle messenger named Anthony Colleton said, ''He's against women priests and homosexual rights, but he's a cool guy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Colleton went on to explain: ''When someone is cool, they are really forgiving, and anyone who stands by their principles is cool.''</p>
