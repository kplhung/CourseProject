        <p>Richard Li moved a step closer to sealing his audacious bid for Hong Kong's main telephone company today, as the board of Cable and Wireless HKT approved the filing of a takeover document to be voted on by shareholders next month.</p>
        <p>But even as Mr. Li's company, Pacific Century Cyberworks, cleared another hurdle to its giant purchase, it got a rude reminder of what it is taking on: Cable and Wireless HKT reported a 28 percent decline in its 1999 earnings, as rivals went after its long-distance and cellular franchises.</p>
        <p>Hong Kong's government recently opened those markets to competition, and Cable and Wireless HKT said it was facing ''intense price competition.'' The earnings decline was even steeper after an extraordinary charge of $916 million for the company's write-off of interactive television assets. Net income fell 90 percent, to $147 million, on sales of $3.65 billion.</p>
        <p>Linus W. L. Cheung, the chief executive of HKT, said that his company's future lay outside the traditional phone business -- in Internet, e-commerce, and broadband services. Not coincidentally, that is the rationale behind the deal with Pacific Century, a tiny Internet company with big ambitions.</p>
        <p>Pacific Century's proposed deal was thrown into doubt last week by its own tumbling stock price and reports that Singapore Telecommunications and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation were thinking about reviving their offer for Cable and Wireless HKT. Mr. Li's company had vanquished the two in February in one of Asia's most watched corporate takeover battles.</p>
        <p>Today, an executive close to Singapore Telecom said the company was negotiating with potential partners in the United States and Europe to mount a new bid. Singapore Telecom was also in talks with a big mainland Chinese phone company, this person said. That could make its offer more palatable than the last one, which was seen as being masterminded by the Singapore government.</p>
        <p>The executive dismissed HKT's board action today, saying the real verdict would come in a vote by shareholders of HKT's London-based parent, Cable and Wireless P.L.C., on June 13.</p>
        <p>''These are traditional British institutional shareholders,'' said the executive. ''They're going to wake up on June 14 and realize that they're getting 20 percent of Richard Li's stock, which is worth a lot less than they thought.''</p>
        <p>Pacific Century's stock has fallen 31 percent since Feb. 29, cutting the value of its stock-and-cash offer for Cable and Wireless HKT to $28.2 billion from $35.9 billion. The slide continued today: Pacific Century's shares fell 2.8 percent, to 15.15 Hong Kong dollars, or $1.95. Shares of Cable and Wireless HKT dropped 2.2 percent, to 18.20 Hong Kong dollars, or $2.34.</p>
        <p>At a news conference here today, the chairman of Cable and Wireless P.L.C., Graham Wallace, said he was not aware of a counterbid, and that his company had ''irrevocably committed to accepting PCCW's offer.''  Mr. Wallace played down concerns about the drop in Pacific Century's shares, saying Cable and Wireless was ''very comfortable and very happy to be taking shares in PCCW.''</p>
        <p>Hong Kong's phone company used to be the crown jewel in the Cable and Wireless empire. But with ferocious competition in this city's international and mobile-phone markets, Cable and Wireless HKT is looking like an exhausted and tarnished former monopoly. Revenue from international telephone services fell 38 percent in fiscal 1999, while cellular sales declined 15 percent.</p>
        <p>''They're in a competitive business with declining profitability,'' said David Webb, an investment banker who runs an Internet site that tracks deals in Hong Kong. ''If and when Cyberworks completes this transaction, it's going to be dragged down by the erosion in HKT's core business.''</p>
        <p>Dismal as they were, Cable and Wireless HKT's results were in line with expectations. And the company pointed to a few bright spots. Sales of Internet and multimedia services rose 66 percent in 1999. With 561,000 Internet customers -- 77,000 of whom subscribe to high-speed broadband access -- Cable and Wireless HKT has one of Asia's most powerful Internet franchises.</p>
        <p>Executives close to Pacific Century said that they were not fazed by the erosion in HKT's phone business. They said they had begun devising plans to expand Internet and broadband services with their counterparts at HKT. As for the reports about a rival bid, they contended that people in the Singapore Telecom camp were trying to drag down Pacific Century's share price.</p>
        <p>''Why would a U.S. or a European telecom player think they could come in and pick up the pieces?'' asked an executive close to Pacific Century. ''It just won't hang together.''</p>
