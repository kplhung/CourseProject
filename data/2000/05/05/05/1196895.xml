        <p>The Flintstones In Viva Rock Vegas  Mark Addy, Stephen Baldwin, Kristen Johnston, Jane Krakowski, Thomas Gibson, Alan Cumming  Directed by Brian Levant  PG 90 minutes</p>
        <p>Sent to study human mating habits, the alien Great Gazoo (with the voice of Mr. Cumming) finds himself observing Fred Flintstone (Mr. Addy, who talks like Jackie Gleason) and Barney Rubble (Mr. Baldwin, wearing his squinty-ditz look).</p>
        <p>Fred and Barney have no mates, obviating their usefulness in the Gazoo inquiry. But then at a fast-food drive-in, Barney attracts Betty O'Shale (Ms. Krakowski), a curvaceous waitress on roller skates. Betty, it turns out, has just befriended Wilma Slaghoople (Ms. Johnston), a rich girl who could use a new life after bailing out of an intolerable situation at home.</p>

        <p>The Flintstones In Viva Rock Vegas  Mark Addy, Stephen Baldwin, Kristen Johnston, Jane Krakowski, Thomas Gibson, Alan Cumming  Directed by Brian Levant  PG 90 minutes</p>
        <p>Sent to study human mating habits, the alien Great Gazoo (with the voice of Mr. Cumming) finds himself observing Fred Flintstone (Mr. Addy, who talks like Jackie Gleason) and Barney Rubble (Mr. Baldwin, wearing his squinty-ditz look).</p>
        <p>Fred and Barney have no mates, obviating their usefulness in the Gazoo inquiry. But then at a fast-food drive-in, Barney attracts Betty O'Shale (Ms. Krakowski), a curvaceous waitress on roller skates. Betty, it turns out, has just befriended Wilma Slaghoople (Ms. Johnston), a rich girl who could use a new life after bailing out of an intolerable situation at home.</p>
        <p>After a pointless romantic convolution, Betty ends up with Barney, and Wilma, warmly down-to-earth despite her lofty heritage, is paired with Fred. Let the mating commence. But first there are the rivalries to get through. Wilma is still coveted by an old boyfriend, the slicked-down Chip Rockefeller (Mr. Gibson), and after a misunderstanding with Barney, Betty gets her head turned by the rock singer Mick Jagged (Mr. Cumming).</p>
        <p>To set up a love crisis, everybody wings off by pterodactyl to the gambling mecca Rock Vegas. Chip, who was first in his class at Princestone (few names go unpunned), owns the town, but he has money problems with the mob, and marriage to Wilma and the Slaghoople millions is his only solution. Meanwhile, Fred develops a gambling problem. Yabba-dabba.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE None.  SEX No sex in a PG movie, just mildy suggestive references.  PROFANITY None.  FOOTNOTE A sexual premise, if that's what it could be called, seems an odd choice for a family film.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?  AGES 3-6 Love angle aside, this is a candy-colored movie with a cartoonish look, a lot of visual gags and one sloppy, cuddly dinosaur to please the littlest ones.  AGES 7-10 Silly stuff, but they should enjoy themselves.  AGES 11 AND UP By now the banalities will begin to take their toll. Age 11 should be about the cutoff point.</p>
        <p>U-571  Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Harvey Keitel, Jake Weber  Directed by Jonathan Mostow  PG-13 120 minutes</p>
        <p>Sun-deprived men wolfing citrus can presage a good submarine scrap (witness ''Das Boot''), and here we have a traditional rivet-popper fought in the North Atlantic over possession of the Enigma code machine used to direct German U-boats in World War II.</p>
        <p>Damage from depth charges forces the Enigma-equipped U-571 to the surface, where it lies dead in the water awaiting a rescue mission from Germany. Moving a bit faster, an American submarine arrives first and dispatches a boarding party disguised as German sailors to take over the U-boat and snatch the Enigma. That goes well if bloodily, but just as the team is paddling off in their inflatables, their own submarine is blown out of the water.</p>
        <p>So the Americans paddle back to U-571 and try to make a dive for it. Problem is, the U-boat is in sorry shape itself and all the instructions are in German. Luckily a Yank mechanical genius (absolutely indispensable in any submarine movie) gets a few pistons pumping.</p>
        <p>Other characters aren't exactly original either, but they step up. Earlier denied a command because of his indecisiveness, the young ranking officer (Mr. McConaughey) gets ornery and smart when U-571 is cornered by a German destroyer. That rallies the crew, led by the usual gnarled chief sea dog (Mr. Keitel, acting unusually standard-issue). The obligatory dive takes the vessel, spouting at every seam, to 650 feet. At that depth it would split open 99 times out of 100 but somehow it doesn't this time. Now where did they put the Enigma?</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE Blood, red and wet, gets spilled during wild gun battles below decks, and the Germans execute a lifeboat full of survivors (with the camera's eye averted).  SEX None.  PROFANITY Submariners cuss when excited.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?  AGES 3-7 Too loud and intense for small children.  AGES 8-10 Some scenes -- a man on fire, for example, or seamen abandoned in the water -- could be disturbing, but this is a simple, rousing old-fashioned war movie with plenty of by-golly uplift. Most children this age can handle it.  AGES 11 AND UP Sound battle stations.</p>
        <p>Where the Heart Is  Natalie Portman, Ashley Judd, James Frain, Stockard Channing, Joan Cusack  Directed by Matt Williams  PG-13 115 minutes</p>
        <p>Other people's disasters erupt every few minutes in this Oklahoma soap opera, but the main claim to pathos belongs to the very simple country girl Novalee Nation (Ms. Portman). Ditched while pregnant in a Wal-Mart parking lot, Novalee starts living in the store, where she uses a sleeping bag and whatever consumer items she needs and returns them to the shelves when she's finished.</p>
        <p>Novalee also makes tentative friends in the area. An earth mother named Sister Husband (Ms. Channing) gives her a tree and encouragement, and a studious, addled young librarian named Forney (Mr. Frain) does his Bruce Willis ''Die Hard'' imitation, diving through a plate glass window to help Novalee give birth on the floor of Wal-Mart.</p>
        <p>She names her new daughter Americus, after, she says, this great country of ours. Hearing the circumstances, the media make a big national fuss over Novalee, the hate mail pours in (some nice letters, too), and Wal-Mart gives her some money and a job. Novalee's mother (Sally Field) materializes to steal the money. At the hospital, Novalee befriends Lexie Coop (Ms. Judd), who has five children from various liaisons and is perhaps the most trouble-prone character of them all. And every Oklahoma potboiler needs a twister to spread more misery.</p>
        <p>On the brighter side, Novalee inherits a nest egg and shows some talent as a Wal-Mart photographer. Americus flourishes.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE Lexie gets beaten up by a boyfriend whom she catches molesting her children. None of this is shown but her description of the act leaves a particularly nasty taste.  SEX Never performed but often referred to and quite frankly.  PROFANITY Strong and flavorful at times but not overdone.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?  UNDER AGE 11 Definitely not for young children.  AGES 11-13 The story is standard and predictable, the sentiment thick and exploited. But this is Ms. Portman's show, and Novalee is an appealing character. Parental decisions could go either way, but pre-teenagers will be drawn.</p>
