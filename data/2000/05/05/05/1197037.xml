        <p>MTV: Music Television in New York, part of the MTV Networks unit of Viacom Inc., said yesterday that it had named Modernista in Boston to handle a new brand-image campaign that will run both on and off MTV. Billings have not been determined.</p>
        <p>Christina Norman, senior vice president for marketing and on-air promotions at MTV, said the decision came after a three-month review that had been narrowed to Modernista and two other agencies: DiNoto/Lee in New York and Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky in Miami. MTV's in-house advertising department also pitched ideas that would be developed into campaigns, she said, adding that ''the in-house process is and always has been ongoing.''</p>
