        <p>Here is a selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>BARBARA CARROLL, Bemelmans Bar, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. The agelessly chic red-haired pianist and singer seems to know every important popular song ever written and to be able to perform from memory in any key. Her elegant, lyrical pianism is a compendium of 20th-century jazz styles, from Count Basie to Erroll Garner to Bill Evans and beyond. And her clipped, understated vocals, which verge on speech-song, approach lyrics from a wry but warmhearted point of view. Through July 22. Tuesday through Saturday nights, beginning at 9:30. From 5:30 to 8 Michael Devine. No cover for early show; cover for late show: $15. No minimum; $5 cover at the bar.</p>

        <p>BARBARA CARROLL, Bemelmans Bar, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600.

From 5:30 to 8 Michael Devine. No cover for early show; cover for late show: $15. No minimum; $5 cover at the bar.</p>
        <p>* ''OUR SINATRA,'' Blue Angel Theater, 323 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. The rising young cabaret star Eric Comstock is the mastermind behind this utterly winning tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes, which focuses on what Mr. Comstock calls the hidden gems and orphan songs that Sinatra made popular. Joined by Christopher Gines, a creamy baritone who echoes Dick Haymes and Steve Lawrence in their prime, and Hilary Kole, a perky swinger, Mr. Comstock conducts a witty and knowledgeable survey of the Sinatra canon. Mr. Comstock focuses on the mature Sinatra and Mr. Gines on the dreamy 1940's balladeer, with Ms. Kole bridging the gap. The memorable show proves there are still young singers good enough to keep the tradition alive. Today, tomorrow, Monday and Thursday nights at 8; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m.; Wednesday at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50 and $55 (premium ringside seating, $75 and $80).</p>
        <p>* STEVE ROSS, the Firebird Cafe, 365 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 586-0244. Although this debonair singer and pianist is best known for playfully inhabiting the spirits of Cole Porter, Noel Coward and Fred Astaire, he also has an introspective side. And in his superb new show, ''Love and Laughter, Part 1,'' witty romps like Porter's ''They Couldn't Compare to You'' are balanced by meditative renditions of ''All Through the Night,'' ''My Shining Hour,'' ''I Can Dream, Can't I?'' and ''One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)'' that find psychological dimensions in familiar ballads. At his most lucid, his dry, self-aware interpretations make him a philosopher of fantasy. Wednesday and Thursday nights at 9; Fridays and Saturdays at 9 and 11. Through June 3. Cover: $30; $15 minimum. Also at the Firebird, Christine Lavin, Sunday night at 7, as part of the songwriters' series. Cover $20; $15 minimum. Sunday nights at 9, James Beaman as Marlene Dietrich. Through May 28. Cover: $30; $15 minimum.</p>
        <p>* BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. Although his voice has its ups and downs, Mr. Short, now 75, still gives the best cabaret party in New York. For his 32nd spring season at the Cafe Carlyle, he is joined by a small, top-notch swing band, and he struts his bluesier pianism in the instrumental ''Moten Swing.'' Nobody puts a more vivacious spin on Cole Porter than Mr. Short, whose new show includes a boyishly wistful version of ''Why Shouldn't I?'' and the hilariously tongue-twisting, double-entendre-laden title song from ''Can-Can.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Through June 24. Cover: $60 at tables, no minimum; $30 cover at the bar.</p>
        <p>IRIS WILLIAMS, the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 840-6800. This demure Welsh singer has one of the most striking voices in all of cabaret, a rich, dusky, buzzing contralto. Returning to the Oak Room for the first time in eight years, she is performing a program of mostly love songs, high points being ''La Vie en Rose'' (in tribute to her idol, Edith Piaf) and a deep, smoky ''I Loves You, Porgy.'' But the show is also more like a recital than a cabaret act, and the jazzier the song, the more inhibited Ms. Williams's singing becomes. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30; Tuesdays through Thursdays at 9. Through May 13. Cover: $50, with $50 prix fixe dinner required for early shows; $15 food or drink minimum for late shows; suggested dinner arrival for early show is 7.</p>
        <p>ARCI'S PLACE, 450 Park Avenue South, at 30th Street, (212) 532-4370. The singer Eileen Fulton. Tonight at 8; tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11. Kaye Ballard opens on Tuesday. Cover: $25; $15 minimum.</p>
        <p>LAURIE BEECHMAN THEATER, West Bank Cafe, 407 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 695-6909. Tomorrow night at 8:30, Jamie deRoy in a benefit for the Humane Society, with Bill Brooks, Rondi Charleston, Julia Wade, Christopher John Gillespie, Kristopher McDowell, Jay Rogers, the vocal group Zaz, Scott Coulter and Lea Marie Golde. Cover: $20; one-drink minimum.</p>
        <p>DANNY'S SKYLIGHT ROOM, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133. Tonight at 7, ''Savoring the Brew: A Taste of Shakespeare's Women,'' a collaborative work by Mary Emily Deal, Michelle Jordan and Christina Purcell; from 9 to 1, Jerry Scott; at 9:30, Laurie Krauz, singer. Tomorrow from 5 to 9 p.m. in the piano bar, Chuck Musone; at 7, Leonisa Ardizzone, singer, and the Chris Jennings Trio; from 9 to 1 in the piano bar, Mr. Scott; at 9:30; Sara Kiel, singer, with Jim Frederick, pianist.

Tomorrow night at 8, ''Bed, Boys and Beyond,'' comedy show; at 10:30, ''Foxy Ladies,'' musical revue. Sunday night at 7, Anthony Gaglioni, singer; at 9, ''Bed, Boys and Beyond.''
