        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton finished her tour through each of the state's 62 counties today with a sharp attack on George W. Bush's tax cut proposals, leaving her mostly Republican audience in silence.</p>
        <p>In the last 10 months, Mrs. Clinton's race for the United States Senate has taken her from the Delaware County farm of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the retiring senator, to the shore of Lake Champlain in, of all places, Clinton County, which she chose as her last stop. In many towns, Mrs. Clinton has been treated more like a celebrity than a political candidate. Even Republicans who have no intention of voting for Mrs. Clinton have come to get a glimpse of her.</p>
        <p>In outlining her opposition to Mr. Bush's call for a $1.3 trillion tax cut over 10 years, Mrs. Clinton said his plan would hurt efforts to win more federal money for New York because such broad-based tax reductions would deplete the surplus.</p>
        <p>''I cannot support Governor Bush's large across-the-board tax cut,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''I do not think that's right for New York or our country. The last thing we need right now before we can eliminate some of that deficit with Washington is a large across-the-board tax cut.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's audience enthusiastically applauded her speech until she suggested tax cuts smaller than those favored by Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate. Many in the audience stopped practically in midclap, in apparent disagreement.</p>
        <p>Even though upstate New York is predominantly Republican territory, it is considered potentially critical for Mrs. Clinton this year because the Senate race is viewed as an extremely close contest.</p>
        <p>Speaking at Clinton Community College, the first lady gave a localized version of her standard stump speech, pledging to try to improve the border crossing at Champlain and to try to win federal subsidies for natural gas distribution systems, proposals that were both greeted with sustained applause.</p>
        <p>At a news conference after the speech, Mrs. Clinton said she recognized that her audience might not be receptive to her views on tax cuts. ''I said, 'I know there are a lot of Republicans in the audience,' '' she said. ''I am well aware a lot of Republicans are sorting out where they are on this issue, but I want people in the North Country to know I support targeted tax cuts.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton also tried to draw sharp distinctions between herself and her likely Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York.</p>
        <p>She criticized Mr. Giuliani for stating at a town hall meeting Wednesday that he would vote for Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, to continue as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Helms's opposition to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and United Nations conventions on women's and children's rights had hurt American foreign policy.</p>
