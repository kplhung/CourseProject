        <p>President Clinton today heaped praise on charter schools on a visit to the first one founded in the nation, but criticized some state laws governing the independent public schools as too strict or too lax.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton addressed high school students at City Academy here as part of a two-day tour of public schools in Kentucky, Iowa, Minnesota and Ohio, in which he is pushing his own education proposals and those of Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic presidential candidate.</p>
        <p>Democrats and teachers' unions have embraced charter schools -- publicly financed schools that operate largely free of state and local regulations and unions -- as a palatable alternative to voucher programs, which are favored by Republicans. Throughout his presidency, Mr. Clinton has said that vouchers unfairly drain resources from struggling public schools.</p>
        <p>''We now have enough evidence that the charter school movement works, if it's done right,'' he told an audience of several hundred students, teachers and community members gathered in the school gymnasium. ''Very often we see charter schools provide an even greater atmosphere of competition that induces kids to work harder and harder to learn.''</p>
        <p>Critics of the concept of charter schools note that many of them have struggled financially while others have been shut down for failing to provide proper buildings, adequately trained teachers or sufficiently rigorous curriculums.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton stressed today that those schools are the exception to the rule and pointed to City Academy as an example of how charter schools should work.</p>
        <p>The school, housed in a recreation center in a working-class neighborhood, opened in 1992, the year Mr. Clinton was elected to the presidency. City Academy now has 100 students, most of whom are poor and members of minorities, and 90 percent go on to college.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Clinton released $137 million in start-up grants for charter schools, many of which depend on three-year federal grants as seed money to buy buildings.</p>
        <p>He praised Minnesota's charter school law as a model for other states to emulate, saying it held charter schools accountable while giving them the flexibility to serve students from many different backgrounds and with many different learning styles.</p>
        <p>''You basically have struck the right balance,'' he said. ''You have encouraged the growth of charter schools, but you do hold charter schools responsible for results. That's what every state in this country ought to do.''</p>
        <p>Some states, Mr. Clinton acknowledged, have not kept a close enough watch over charter schools. Others, he said, have not given the schools the freedom they need to succeed. Many strict laws are the result of pressure from teachers' unions, which want to control who the schools can hire and how much their teachers work.</p>
        <p>''Some states have laws that are so loose that no matter whether the charter schools are doing their job or not, they just get to stay open and they become like another bureaucracy,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''Even worse, some states have laws that are so restrictive it's almost impossible to open a charter school in the first place.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton said that overall, charter schools have the kind of accountability measures that he wants all public schools to be held to.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore have been pushing plans that would punish schools that are given more money but continue to fail, in response to Republican criticism that they have poured more and more money into education programs without insisting on results.</p>
        <p>''We should build the level of accountability you find here in the charter school system into all the schools in our system,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
