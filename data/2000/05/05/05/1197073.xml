        <p>Rick Hartmann, who formerly played on the European Tour, two-putted for birdie on a par-5 first extra hole yesterday at the Cold Spring Country Club to defeat Michael Laudien and win the MasterCard Long Island P.G.A. Championship for the third straight year.</p>
        <p>Hartmann, the head professional at the Atlantic Club in Bridgehampton, N.Y., earned $4,000 for the victory that enabled him to match a feat achieved by Al Brosch of the Cherry Valley Club in Garden City, N.Y., from 1949 to 1951.</p>

        <p>Laudien, of Glen Oaks, had forced a playoff by sinking a 25-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole.</p>
        <p>The final of the MasterCard Westchester P.G.A. Championship at the Siwanoy Country Club was postponed until this morning by a police investigation at the Bronxville course. The Westchester County and Bronxville police would not allow the finalists, David Young and Carl Alexander, to play in the afternoon after each won a morning semifinal.</p>
