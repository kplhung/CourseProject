        <p>Congo's president, Laurent Kabila, watched today as his government signed an agreement that he had long resisted, opening the way for an international peacekeeping force to be stationed in his country.</p>
        <p>Half of the United Nations Security Council was present for the signing of the agreement, which guarantees free access to areas of the country where United Nations officials will need to work and promises that the government will do all it can to protect United Nations personnel, military and civilian.</p>
        <p>The United Nations has been under growing pressure to ''get peacekeeping right'' in the words of Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke of the United States, so the council members came to see the conditions under which a risky operation might soon be established here. They will also travel to several more capitals around the continent to meet with heads of government who have been involved in the war. And several of the envoys, including Mr. Holbrooke, will meet on Friday with a variety of nongovernmental groups working in grass roots politics and civil rights.</p>
        <p>Whether the promises of safety for the peacekeepers are ultimately honored, the issues of freedom of movement and safety have suddenly become more acute after the abduction and apparent killing of peacekeepers this week in Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>Diplomats who took part in the talks with Mr. Kabila said the president seemed to have finally accepted that without firm ground rules for government cooperation there would be no peacekeepers in Congo. The country has been embroiled in a war with half a dozen African nations that has pitted Mr. Kabila's government against rebels backed by his former allies, Uganda and Rwanda.</p>
        <p>When discussions turned to Mr. Kabila's unfulfilled pledges to begin talks with those political opponents, so that national elections can be held, the diplomats said he was less encouraging.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kabila seized power from Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997 and has ruled since then with little tolerance for dissent or opposition. Not long after coming to power, he wriggled out of an agreement that Bill Richardson, then the chief American delegate to the United Nations, said he had negotiated to permit an international investigation into the massacre of tens of thousands of ethnic Hutu refugees during Mr. Kabila's victory sweep across the country.</p>
        <p>Today in Congo, the last of several cease-fires has been holding reasonably well since mid-April. The Security Council has said the fighting must end before it would send 5,500 troops, monitors and support staff members to Congo.</p>
        <p>In closed talks today, Mr. Kabila told the envoys that he wanted the deployment speeded up, a demand on which a number of African nations on different sides of the war agree. And in a major concession, Mr. Kabila said that he would no longer try to block the presence of South Africans in the peacekeeping mission.</p>
        <p>Until this week, diplomats said, Mr. Kabila -- who has a longstanding personal dispute with Nelson Mandela and says that South Africa is in league with his enemies -- resisted all efforts to include South Africans, the continent's best-trained and best-equipped soldiers. Mr. Kabila also agreed in recent days to include Nigerians, another army the United Nations would like to make more use of in Africa. Senegal, Morocco, Tunisia, Pakistan and Italy have already committed personnel for Congo.</p>
        <p>Today at a briefing, Col. Steve Gagnon, a Canadian United Nations officer based here to work on planning for the Congo operation, said that he hoped to begin deploying the first troops by July or August, assuming that a cease-fire continues and the government honors its agreement not to set up obstacles.</p>
        <p>But even as the seven Security Council members sweltered through talks and a signing ceremony, there were hints that the Congo government might have its own interpretations of key parts in the 22-page agreement.</p>
        <p>Foreign Minister Yerodia Abdoulaye Ndombashi -- who signed for the government while Kamel Morjane, Secretary General Kofi Annan's special representative in Congo, signed for the United Nations -- used the ceremony to lash out obliquely at Rwanda and Uganda, Mr. Kabila's former supporters. Referring to the just-signed status of forces agreement, the foreign minister said it was time for outsiders who invaded the country to go home.</p>
        <p>Earlier, in a meeting with journalists, he explained the importance of Congo's sovereign rights and indicated that while access would be, in theory, free to the United Nations, officials would have to go through government channels in planning trips. The United Nations peacekeeping department has faced this problem frequently in the past, and does not want to reopen that battle.</p>
        <p>The Security Council members on this trip, in addition to Mr. Holbrooke, the delegation leader, were Sir Jeremy Greenstock of Britain; Jean-David Levitte of France; Martin Andjaba of Namibia; Peter van Walsum of the Netherlands; Moctar Ouane of Mali; and Said ben Mustapha of Tunisia.</p>
