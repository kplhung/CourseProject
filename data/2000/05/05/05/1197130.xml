        <p>Early in ''The New Eve,'' Catherine Corsini's X-ray portrait of a ''liberated'' young Parisian woman, its distraught, headstrong anti-heroine, Camille (Karin Viard), professes her contempt for marriage with its tiresome domestic prattle about babies and child care. At the time, Camille, a sometime artist who works as a lifeguard at an indoor pool, is in a car with a lesbian couple. The three have recently attended a freewheeling anything-goes sex party at which Camille is shown wandering dazedly through a smorgasbord of kink and ends up offending the hostess by getting drunk and stoned and throwing up on her bed.</p>
        <p>''The New Eve,'' which opens today at Cinema Village, is a portrait of this restless, impulsive gamine who throws herself with abandon into relationships with men and women. When she falls madly in love with a man who is happily married with two children, it does not occur to her that breaking up his marriage might be wrong. She simply has to have him. And when he resists, she literally throws herself into the arms of another man to make him jealous and to assuage her wounded pride.</p>

        <p>Early in ''The New Eve,'' Catherine Corsini's X-ray portrait of a ''liberated'' young Parisian woman, its distraught, headstrong anti-heroine, Camille (Karin Viard), professes her contempt for marriage with its tiresome domestic prattle about babies and child care. At the time, Camille, a sometime artist who works as a lifeguard at an indoor pool, is in a car with a lesbian couple. The three have recently attended a freewheeling anything-goes sex party at which Camille is shown wandering dazedly through a smorgasbord of kink and ends up offending the hostess by getting drunk and stoned and throwing up on her bed.</p>
        <p>''The New Eve,'' which opens today at Cinema Village, is a portrait of this restless, impulsive gamine who throws herself with abandon into relationships with men and women. When she falls madly in love with a man who is happily married with two children, it does not occur to her that breaking up his marriage might be wrong. She simply has to have him. And when he resists, she literally throws herself into the arms of another man to make him jealous and to assuage her wounded pride.</p>
        <p>The very title, ''The New Eve,'' suggests that Camille is a contemporary archetype, a postfeminist bisexual bohemian. But this seething mass of frustrations who grabs at whatever she imagines might gratify her romantic fantasies is closer to a case study.</p>
        <p>When that married man, Alexis (Pierre-Loup Rajot), a Socialist Party organizer, tells her that she is a terrorist, he is right. But his awareness of her problems does not prevent him from succumbing to her neediness and reciprocating her passion.</p>
        <p>Camille might have been an extremely unpleasant character were it not for Ms. Viard's extraordinarily insightful portrayal, which captures her every mood swing and fleeting thought with an astonishing naturalness. Although Camille has more than enough sexual magnetism to get what she wants, she prefers to see herself as a victim. When she doesn't get her way, she goes to bars, gets wildly drunk and flirts outrageously. If one of her lovers tells her something she does not want to hear, she does things like break dishes over her head and screams. What is most disturbing about the movie is that it allows Camille to do a great deal of damage to others without having her develop a conscience or even much insight.</p>
        <p>The bulk of the movie concentrates on Camille's campaign to win Alexis, whom she meets accidentally when she drops some packages on the street and he helps her pick them up. She is so grateful that she instantly falls in love. The earnest, balding 40-year-old Socialist turns out to be a do-gooder, the last thing in the world Camille could ever become. She attaches herself to him, attending political meetings, helping him put up posters and becoming ''Aunt Camille'' to his two young daughters.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Alexis gives in to her storm-trooper tactics. During the affair that develops she torments him with impossible demands. When he refuses to leave his wife, she impulsively marries Ben (Sergi Lopez), the same clueless truck driver into whose arms she flew when Alexis initially rejected her.</p>
        <p>''The New Eve'' has some wrong notes. The orgy Eve attends in the movie's early scenes is one of those carefully programmed show-and-tell affairs that used to signal ''decadence'' in 1960's movies exploring that decade's swinging bohemian fringe. And its lesbians are little more than kindly stick figures. A sequence in a lesbian bar in which a woman uses Camille to make her lover jealous rings false.</p>
        <p>But most of the movie's notes are appallingly right. You leave the movie thinking it's a shame that reckless, self-dramatizing narcissists like Camille do not come with warning signs flashing over their heads. But no matter what you think of Camille, you're unlikely to forget her.</p>
