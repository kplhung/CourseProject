        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman announced today that she would nominate James R. Zazzali, a former New Jersey attorney general and a labor lawyer, to the State Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>If the nomination is approved by the State Senate, Mr. Zazzali will become Mrs. Whitman's sixth appointee to the court, giving her what is believed to be the largest number of appointments by a single New Jersey governor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zazzali would replace Justice Daniel J. O'Hern, who on May 23 will turn 70, the mandatory retirement age on the seven-member court.</p>
        <p>Like Justice O'Hern, Mr. Zazzali, 62, is a Democrat, and his selection follows the state's tradition of matching the party affiliation of incoming members with those leaving. Whether Mr. Zazzali's appointment would continue the court's tilt to the right was not clear today, although lawyers who follow the court said Mr. Zazzali's experience as a labor lawyer and his party affiliation might make him a brake against the growing conservatism of a court that once had a national reputation for liberalism.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman seemed to acknowledge the speculation about Mr. Zazzali's ideological temperament when she said at a State House news conference, ''Jim Zazzali has a special combination of strengths that will round out my additions to the court.''</p>
        <p>When asked to describe his judicial philosophy at today's announcement, Mr. Zazzali replied: ''Sensible. Good justices look at the various tools given to them in a case and oil them with common sense.''</p>
        <p>Justice O'Hern is the last member of a court that for years blocked all efforts by prosecutors to impose death penalties on convicted murderers and expanded the state's role in social issues by forcing suburbs to accept low-income housing and requiring the state to spend more money on low-performing urban schools.</p>
        <p>The nomination of Mr. Zazzali, who lives in Rumson, came as a disappointment to some South Jersey politicians, who had urged the governor to pick a candidate from south of Trenton to match Justice O'Hern's roots in Red Bank.</p>
        <p>''I would have preferred somebody from South Jersey,'' said State Senator William L. Gormley of Mays Landing. But he said he expected the Senate to confirm the nomination.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zazzali spent a year as Gov. Brendan Byrne's attorney general in the early 1980's and then served for 10 years, ultimately as chairman, of the State Commission of Investigation, which conducted numerous high-profile inquiries into mob activity in labor unions, restaurants and the garment industry, and into poor conditions in county jails.</p>
        <p>Since then, Mr. Zazzali has been in private practice at Zazzali, Zazzali, Fagella &amp; Nowak in Newark.</p>
        <p>''My impression is that he's a pretty reasonable person without a particular ax to grind,'' said Jonathan Hyman, a professor at Rutgers Law School. ''He tended to be on the labor side of issues, and although that doesn't necessarily tell you what a person's views are going to be, I would think his would tend to be less conservative than someone who spent a lot of time representing corporations.''</p>
        <p>As a member of the Investigation Commission, Mr. Zazzali once asked a garment manufacturer if he was ashamed of underpaying his workers. More recently, Mr. Zazzali filed briefs in support of construction union members who successfully sued in state court to block a legal loophole that allowed some builders to avoid making required payments into workers' pension funds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zazzali also served as counsel for a state trustee for Teamsters Local 560, which had been taken over by the state because of its ties to the mob. The local was returned to rank-and-file control last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zazzali joked self-deprecatingly today about his nomination and his abilities, and thanked the governor for disproving F. Scott Fitzgerald's observation that there are no second acts in American lives. ''You really get one shot to distinguish yourself in public service,'' he said. ''I am thankful that Governor Whitman has given me a second chance.''</p>
