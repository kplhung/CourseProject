        <p>Richard Pryor has so rarely been captured in his truest essence that ''Wattstax,'' a 1973 documentary about a benefit performance for the Watts community in Los Angeles, is worth seeing just for the few moments of the comedian ''maxing and relaxing'' through a few routines that frame the action.</p>
        <p>The picture, which opens today at the Screening Room in a new print, includes an interview with Mr. Pryor, and he throws out a few lines with a coolness so sly it could initially seem like indifference. This is the Pryor of the clubs and coffeehouses, when he was making his reputation before he blew up into a household name.</p>

        <p>Richard Pryor has so rarely been captured in his truest essence that ''Wattstax,'' a 1973 documentary about a benefit performance for the Watts community in Los Angeles, is worth seeing just for the few moments of the comedian ''maxing and relaxing'' through a few routines that frame the action.</p>
        <p>The picture, which opens today at the Screening Room in a new print, includes an interview with Mr. Pryor, and he throws out a few lines with a coolness so sly it could initially seem like indifference. This is the Pryor of the clubs and coffeehouses, when he was making his reputation before he blew up into a household name.</p>
        <p>His slippery brilliance is evident, with hair-trigger reflexes so brutal that he's like Cassius Clay in the legendary Sonny Liston fight, when the punch that dropped Liston came so fast no one is sure whether he threw it. Mr. Pryor is feral in his swiftness; you can see the routines cooking up in his head.</p>
        <p>Mel Stuart's film about the benefit concert, staged by the artists of the Stax recording label in 1971, seven years after the riots in Watts, has a title that is meant to suggest Woodstock and to convey the African-American concept of taking the name to make something new of it. It has nothing quite so extraordinary as Jimi Hendrix's left-hand-of-God guitar solos in ''Woodstock,'' but that doesn't prevent ''Wattstax'' from being a lovable capsule of many of the artists who worked for Stax, the little Southern soul label that could.</p>
        <p>Rufus Thomas, a comic sight to make eyes sore, dances the funky chicken in hot pants. The Staple Singers use their crowd-pleasing gospel-flavored ethic to put the confection ''Oh La Di Da'' across. In an odd scene, Isaac Hayes chugs through ''Rolling Down a Mountainside,'' an inspirational tune that feels like a funk dirge.</p>
        <p>Speaking at a documentary conference in Los Angeles a few years ago, Mr. Stuart revealed the reason for the peculiarity of the Hayes interlude. It seems Mr. Hayes actually sang ''Theme From 'Shaft' '' at the show, but Mr. Stuart and his film crew couldn't afford to buy the rights. So, in a studio long after Wattstax was over, Mr. Hayes and his band lip-synched their way through ''Mountainside,'' which explains why you never see him and the crowd in the same shot during the song and answers the nagging question of just where was that string section hiding, anyway. (Mr. Hayes himself corroborates the story in ''What It Is, What It Was'' (Hyperion, 1998), a quick-read necessity on 70's black films.) Perhaps because of that karma, Mr. Hayes never scored with ''Mountainside''; the cover by the Main Ingredient, featuring Cuba Gooding Sr., made a bigger splash.</p>
        <p>''Wattstax'' is playing at the Screening Room, 54 Varick Street, at Laight Street, TriBeCa, through Thursday. Tickets: $9; $6 for the elderly. Information and screening schedule: (212) 334-2100.</p>
