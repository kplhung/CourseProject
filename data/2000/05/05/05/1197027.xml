        <p>Twice this series, the benches at Pacific Bell Park emptied. Twice the San Francisco Giants scored six runs in an inning. Twice the Giants' Jeff Kent hit a home run to put a game away. Four times, the Giants beat the Mets.</p>
        <p>The Giants won today, 7-2, completing their first four-game sweep of the Mets since 1962, when the transplanted Giants returned to the Polo Grounds for the first time to play a four-game series against fthe expansion Mets, who had succeeded them and the Dodgers as New York's National League team. The Mets led today in the bottom of the eighth, but the Giants scored six times in the inning in which Dennis Cook cracked and Armando Benitez crumbled.</p>
        <p>Mets starter Rick Reed sifted through the rubble and found what caused the collapse.</p>
        <p>''That walk in the eighth inning, that seemed to open up the floodgates for them,'' said Reed, who lost for the first time this season. ''Walks always come back to hurt you, and they did today.''</p>
        <p>Reed's sinker was his best pitch as he allowed only three hits and one run through seven innings. His first walk of the game -- and just his eighth of the year -- was to Armando Rios leading off the eighth inning, when the Mets led, 2-1. With one out and two on, Felipe Crespo singled to tie the game, and Cook came on in relief.</p>
        <p>Cook proceeded to balk the runners to second and third, and then he bolted toward the second-base umpire Mark Wegner, adamant over the fact that his ''spin move'' to second, which he has used for years, was called illegal. When he calmed down, his 0-1 fastball hit Marvin Benard in the ribs, loading the bases. Benard glared at Cook, and Cook took a few steps toward Benard. Suddenly the benches emptied, just as they had on Monday, but again, no punches were thrown. This episode was more heated, though, with Cook being held back by the Mets' 6-foot-4-inch, 240-pound batting coach, Tom Robson.</p>
        <p>Eventually Cook got back on the rubber, but Manager Bobby Valentine thought it would be unwise to leave him in. He might have been right: instead of walking directly to the dugout after being lifted for Benitez, Cook romped to first for some words with Benard.</p>
        <p>''I've been in the game long enough where I think that people who understand the game don't give you those kind of looks,'' Cook, who is 37 years old, said of Benard, 30. ''He obviously wasn't happy about being hit, but if he knew the game and thought before he reacted, he would see how silly he was.''</p>
        <p>Cook said it was ridiculous to think he would hit Benard to load the bases, especially with Bonds up two batters later.</p>
        <p>But Benard said he did nothing more than look at Cook.</p>
        <p>''I've got no reason to charge the mound,'' he said. ''The guy wasn't trying to hit me.''</p>
        <p>Some Mets were also irritated with Benard for a play on Wednesday in which he overran home plate in an apparent attempt to knock down catcher Todd Pratt. Pratt called it ''cheap,'' Benard called it clean, but further flare-ups will have to wait: the teams do not meet again for three months.</p>
        <p>More important now is the way the Mets have played lately. After winning nine in a row, they have lost seven of nine, and after the game they flew to Florida to face the Marlins without a day off.</p>
        <p>Mike Piazza returned to the lineup after missing five starts with an elbow and wrist injury, and had three of the Mets' four hits, including a two-run home run. But the Mets' pitching has been susceptible to big innings, allowing opponents to score at least three runs in an inning 10 times in seven games.</p>
        <p>Benitez has allowed five runs in two and two-thirds innings, including two in the eighth inning. Bill Mueller tripled in three runs, giving the Giants a 5-2 lead, and Kent -- whose three-run homer off Turk Wendell won Wednesday's game -- lofted a two-run homer two batters later.</p>
        <p>Valentine said Benitez seems to be flying open with his front shoulder in his delivery, which is costing him velocity. Benitez said he felt nothing different.</p>
        <p>But something is different with the Mets, who have been hot or cold this season, and never really in between.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Wednesday's Mets-Giants game featured a leadoff home run and a walk-off home run -- and no homers in between. The first batter of the game, JON NUNNALLY, hit a homer, and JEFF KENT hit a game-winning homer in the 11th. According to DAVID VINCENT of the Society for American Baseball Research, the Mets have played only two other games in their 39-year history in which the first and last batters homered, and no other homers were hit. The first was on June 26, 1963, when ELLIS BURTON of the Cubs led off with a homer and TIM HARKNESS of the Mets smacked a game-winner, and the second was on Sept. 10, 1983, when the Mets' MOOKIE WILSON started things off and Montreal's TIM WALLACH homered at the end. There had not been such a game in San Francisco since April 11, 1973, when Houston's JIM WYNN led off with a homer and WILLIE McCOVEY hit the game-winner.</p>
