        <p>Vice President Al Gore continued his intensive assault against Gov. George W. Bush's policies today, saying his Republican rival had been inordinately influenced by the National Rifle Association and had proposed an inadequate health care plan that ''offers too little for too few at the expense of too many.''</p>
        <p>But when asked later by reporters about Mr. Bush's comments that Mr. Gore's attacks were having a corrosive influence on the political process, Mr. Gore refused to respond directly, saying the nation deserved a vigorous debate on the issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore had intended to deliver a health care speech here, since he was addressing the inaugural meeting of the Association of Health Care Journalists, at Northwestern University Memorial Hospital.</p>
        <p>But his aides said he had been captivated by reports in the morning newspapers that suggested that the gun lobby was thrilled at the prospect of a Bush presidency, and Mr. Gore rewrote his speech as he flew here this morning from Washington to draw attention to those reports.</p>
        <p>The New York Times reported that gun manufacturers had broken off settlement talks with 31 cities and counties in hopes that a Bush administration would be more sympathetic than the Clinton administration has been. And The Washington Post reported that Kayne Robinson, first vice president of the N.R.A., had said in a speech to members in February that if Mr. Bush was elected, the gun lobby would expect to have ''a president where we work out of their office.''</p>
        <p>Handgun Control Inc., a lobbying group, began running a 30-second television commercial today that uses videotape of the speech and attacks Mr. Bush as a pawn of the National Rifle Association.</p>
        <p>In his speech, Mr. Gore said, ''Governor Bush has convinced the N.R.A. that he wants to take the gun lobbyists out of the lobby and put them right into the Oval Office.''</p>
        <p>He added in a biting aside, ''Maybe he would pick Charlton Heston as the next surgeon general.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's point was that gun violence, apart from killing people, was straining the nation's health care system, to the tune of $2.3 billion annually, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association, and that Mr. Bush was so deeply in the pocket of the gun lobby that he could not recognize this problem.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush dismissed those accusations. ''I make my positions on what I think is right,'' he said at a news conference in Orange County, Calif. ''If this is an attempt by my opponent to frighten people, I'm not going to let that happen.''</p>
        <p>Asked about Mr. Robinson's speech, Mr. Bush said: ''I don't want to disappoint the man, but I'll be setting up shop in the White House. It'll be my office. I'll make the decision as to what goes on in the White House.''</p>
        <p>Repeating an accusation he has made before, Mr. Bush said: ''I want to say something: I've never been a member of the N.R.A. I think Al Gore's been a member of the N.R.A., if I'm not mistaken.''</p>
        <p>This accusation momentarily befuddled both campaigns, neither of which could find evidence that Mr. Gore had belonged to the gun lobby. Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said the governor might have been referring to a Time magazine article this year that quoted an N.R.A. official as saying Mr. Gore, who represented rural Tennessee in Congress, had once been so opposed to gun control that he could have been the poster boy for it.</p>
        <p>Mr. McClellan said of Mr. Gore, ''I guess he never got around to paying his dues.''</p>
        <p>Asked whether Mr. Bush had misspoken, Mr. McClellan said, ''I'll leave it at that.''</p>
        <p>Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, said: ''The campaign has no record of Al Gore being a member of the N.R.A.''</p>
        <p>Gore aides said Mr. Gore might have inadvertently become a member through a magazine subscription or some other organization.</p>
        <p>''The burden of proof is on Bush,'' Mr. Lehane said. ''He ought to be held to the same standards on distortions that you guys are holding the Gore campaign to.''</p>
        <p>But the day's back and forth seemed less about gun control than about each candidate wanting to paint his opponent with as broad and black a brush as possible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush again said Mr. Gore was distorting his record and ''saying things that simply are not true.''</p>
        <p>''It's amazing that a person running for president of the United States would look people in the eye and say I've never submitted budgets as governor and continue to say so when I did,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>At a news conference, Mr. Gore declined to respond to Mr. Bush's accusations that he was not being factual. But the vice president, who has said Mr. Bush has never put together a real budget, brought that up again. He said he happened to have in his pocket what he said was a copy of Mr. Bush's 1995 budget. He handed it to a reporter, saying, ''If you think that's a budget, then maybe I can convince you it's a duck.''</p>
        <p>The three-page statement contained 12 paragraphs of a general nature and no specific figures.</p>
