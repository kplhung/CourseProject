        <p>As lush symphonic music lifts over the soundtrack of ''I Dreamed of Africa'' and the camera glides across a glistening expanse of water festooned with white birds, you might have the sensation of having seen this movie before. And in a way you have. Fifteen years ago, Sydney Pollack's film version of Isak Dinesen's ''Out of Africa'' aspired to evoke a similar grandeur and sense of awe when contemplating the beauty and fecundity of the African landscape.</p>
        <p>But even in the most picturesque segments of ''I Dreamed of Africa,'' a film that often has the feel of an epic travelogue, something is missing. As hard as Maurice Jarre's music strives for an enveloping aura of romantic mystery tinged with danger, it is no match against John Barry's stately score for the earlier film. The direction by Hugh Hudson (''Chariots of Fire'') feels choppy. And several of the supporting performances are so wooden you begin to wonder whether the director became so enthralled with Africa he forgot about his actors.</p>

        <p>As lush symphonic music lifts over the soundtrack of ''I Dreamed of Africa'' and the camera glides across a glistening expanse of water festooned with white birds, you might have the sensation of having seen this movie before. And in a way you have. Fifteen years ago, Sydney Pollack's film version of Isak Dinesen's ''Out of Africa'' aspired to evoke a similar grandeur and sense of awe when contemplating the beauty and fecundity of the African landscape.</p>
        <p>But even in the most picturesque segments of ''I Dreamed of Africa,'' a film that often has the feel of an epic travelogue, something is missing. As hard as Maurice Jarre's music strives for an enveloping aura of romantic mystery tinged with danger, it is no match against John Barry's stately score for the earlier film. The direction by Hugh Hudson (''Chariots of Fire'') feels choppy. And several of the supporting performances are so wooden you begin to wonder whether the director became so enthralled with Africa he forgot about his actors.</p>
        <p>The thudding screenplay, adapted by Paula Milne and Susan Shilliday from Kuki Gallmann's memoir, fails to capture the spontaneous rhythms and inflections of everyday speech. Everything is spelled out in wordy sentences. The movie repeatedly confuses the author's vague, girlish reflections on the perils of human existence with poetic profundities. Recited solemnly over the soundtrack by Kim Basinger as Kuki, they sound more like the jottings of a naive teenager than the painfully acquired life lessons of a woman who took an enormous risk and lost a lot.</p>
        <p>Advance word of mouth has suggested that Ms. Basinger, who appears in almost every frame of ''I Dreamed of Africa,'' turns in a performance comparable to Meryl Streep's in ''Out of Africa.'' Would that it were so. Ms. Basinger certainly works hard at her role. As this mostly tragic story unfolds, she sheds abundant tears and throws more than one tantrum.</p>
        <p>Yet throughout the movie, the actress never seems grounded. She brings to the movie the same air of spaced-out flightiness that made her ideal for the role of a dreamy prostitute and fantasy figure in ''L.A. Confidential.'' Even when Ms. Basinger has her hands in the dirt, she appears to be floating through the movie like a Tennessee Williams wraith, her beautiful face with its deep-set squinting blue eyes a largely unreadable mask, her milky complexion untouched by the burning African sun. When she becomes upset, her features scrunch into an uncomprehending childlike expression of pain. Kuki experiences a lot of grief and presides over the funerals of two loved ones. But instead of being racked to the core, Ms. Basinger makes her character appear numb, shellshocked and emotionally inaccessible.</p>
        <p>''I Dreamed of Africa'' begins in Italy, where Kuki, a divorced mother of a young son, nearly dies in a car crash after a tipsy evening with friends. The shock rekindles her childhood desire to live in Africa. And as she recovers, she embarks on a passionate affair with Paolo Gallmann (Vincent Perez), a dashing young adventurer who grew up in Africa and longs to return there. Over the strenuous objections of Kuki's mother, Franca (Eva Marie Saint), they marry and settle on a ranch in Kenya.</p>
        <p>The episodic movie portrays Kuki's new life in Africa as a series of initiations in which Kuki overcomes many of her fears. There are the predictable confrontations with lions, elephants and snakes as well as a difficult adjustment to the eerie nighttime cries of the wildlife. Kuki and Paolo are outraged when African poachers raid their property and kill elephants for their ivory. As Kuki settles into her new life, she also discovers that her husband, who disappears for weeks at a time on hunting expeditions with friends, is addicted to risk.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perez is seriously miscast as Paolo, and in their marital squabbles, the wiry, handsome actor behaves more like a petulant gigolo than a rugged adventurer. In their  edgy screen chemistry, Ms. Basinger and Mr. Perez come off as rich, adventure-seeking dilettantes who have wandered far beyond their depth to indulge in an expensive lifestyle experiment. They are so unsympathetic that when they protest the slaughter of the wild animals on their property, you are as likely to side with the poachers as with these  self-righteous landowners.</p>
        <p>An important strand of the story follows the growth of the couple's son, Emanuele, who abruptly jumps from the age of 7 (Liam Aiken) to 17 (Garrett Strommen). The actors' stiff performances (especially Mr. Strommen's) seriously diminish the film's emotional impact. In fact, the movie is so oblivious to time (much of it seems to be set in the 1960's) and the characters' nationalities (Kuki and Paolo speak English but we're told almost nothing about their backgrounds) that it might as well be taking place in a bubble.</p>
        <p>For all its dramatic failings, ''I Dreamed of Africa'' is still gorgeous to look at and occasionally even stirring. One long panning shot of the Kenyan terrain under the bright sunlight, its hidden terrors submerged in the shadows, suggests more about the beauty and treachery of nature and the transience of life than any words spoken in the film can begin to express.</p>
        <p>''I Dreamed of Africa'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations and gory images of slaughtered wild animals.</p>
