        <p>A year ago, the Virginia men won the National Collegiate Athletic Association's lacrosse championship. This year, following Tuesday's 20-7 rout of Butler, they finished the regular season with a 12-1 record and are ranked No. 1 in the nation. And on Sunday, when the N.C.A.A. announces the 12 teams for this month's championship tournament, Virginia should be first among equals.</p>
        <p>Dom Starsia, the Cavaliers' coach, loves it.</p>
        <p>''We have talented players,'' he said. ''We have the confidence of having won a national championship last year, so we believe we have a way to win games. Any pressure of being defending champion or worrying about whether we were ever going to lose a game got knocked out of us in the first game this year.''</p>
        <p>That day, Syracuse beat Virginia, 13-12, in overtime. As Starsia said: ''People were telling us how wonderful we were. We needed a push, and we got it from that game.''</p>
        <p>Starsia was born in Manhattan and grew up in Valley Stream, N.Y. He never played lacrosse in that Long Island hotbed, but got talked into it as a student at Brown.</p>
        <p>He stayed at Brown for 8 years as an assistant coach and 10 years as head coach. This is his eighth season as Virginia's head coach. His success at both universities has gone beyond lacrosse.</p>
        <p>''In all my years at both places, we've graduated 100 percent of our players, and all of them in four years,'' he said. ''We're fortunate that we've been able to talk to the best kids, and they've understood that because there's no professional future in lacrosse, it would be inexcusable to come to college and not get an education.''</p>
        <p>COLLEGE OF NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>The College of New Jersey (formerly Trenton State) has finished its women's regular season with a 13-0 record. No big deal. The Lions have won 120 consecutive regular-season games since a loss to Ithaca in 1991. They have a 74-game home winning streak going back to 1990. They are ranked No. 1 by the Intercollegiate Women's Lacrosse Coaches Association. Now comes the N.C.A.A. Division III tournament, with the Final Four on their home field.</p>
        <p>The architect of this winning streak is Sharon Pfluger, the coach. She also coaches field hockey, where last fall's team went 20-0 and won the N.C.A.A. Division III title. Her 14-year record is 208-14-1 in lacrosse and 289-23-5 in field hockey.</p>
        <p>The new N.C.A.A. Hall of Champions in Indianapolis includes only two female coaches: Pat Summitt of Tennessee and Pfluger. Pfluger's plaque is displayed between those honoring Knute Rockne and Dean Smith.</p>
        <p>Her lacrosse team is mostly home-grown, with 22 players from New Jersey, two from the Philadelphia area and one from Long Island. Emily Felona of Collingswood, N.J., told why she passed up Division I to play for the College of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''You can go to a mediocre Division I school and you'll play, but you'll never see a Final Four,'' she said. ''On my visit here, the coach told me how many national titles this school had won and told me I could wear a championship ring. When I heard that, I knew this is where I wanted to be, and I've been to the Final Four every year I've been here.''</p>
        <p>TITLE IX</p>
        <p>Title IX has left lacrosse, like so many other college nonrevenue sports, partly thriving and partly suffering.</p>
        <p>The legislation requires colleges that receive federal aid, and that covers almost all of them, to give female athletes equal opportunity and spend proportionate funds on them. As a result, because colleges struggle to find funding for women's sports, men's lacrosse is not growing and occasionally diminishing, but women's lacrosse is growing fast.</p>
        <p>Bill Tanton, the senior associate editor of Lacrosse Magazine, said 25,000 men were playing lacrosse at more than 400 colleges. He said there were 240 women's teams, all under the N.C.A.A. roof, fed by 600 high schools.</p>
        <p>Half of the men's teams are in club programs, receiving little or no support from their athletic departments. Most are in the West. They include such major football colleges as Michigan, Brigham Young, California, Colorado State and Georgia Tech, all entered in the United States Lacrosse Intercollegiate Associates four-day tournament starting next Wednesday in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>Title IX has led to often uncomfortable situations. In 1996, Michigan State dropped men's lacrosse because it needed money for women's lacrosse. At Notre Dame, there are lacrosse scholarships for women, none for men.</p>
        <p>As Dom Starsia, the Virginia men's coach, said, ''We need to maintain what we have in the men's game because the women's game is growing dramatically.''</p>
