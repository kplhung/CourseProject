        <p>Tenants' advocates protested proposed increases for tenants of rent stabilized apartments on the steps of City Hall yesterday, calling on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to sharply reduce the increases.</p>
        <p>The protest came days before a preliminary vote on Monday by the city's Rent Guidelines Board on increases, proposed by landlords, of as much as 9 percent on one-year leases and 15 percent on two-year leases.</p>

        <p>Tenants' advocates protested proposed increases for tenants of rent stabilized apartments on the steps of City Hall yesterday, calling on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to sharply reduce the increases.</p>
        <p>The protest came days before a preliminary vote on Monday by the city's Rent Guidelines Board on increases, proposed by landlords, of as much as 9 percent on one-year leases and 15 percent on two-year leases.</p>
        <p>Kenneth Schaeffer, the vice chairman of the tenants' group, the Metropolitan Council on Housing, said the proposals had been orchestrated by City Hall to make the mayor ''appear like a white knight'' who would use his influence to lower the rent increases somewhat, but to levels that he said would still unfairly burden low- and middle-income renters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, who appoints all nine members of the board, has called the proposed raises ''very, very high.''</p>
