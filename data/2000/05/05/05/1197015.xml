        <p>A year ago, Arthur M. Goldberg, the most successful casino operator in Atlantic City, was warning shareholders that Indian gambling in the Catskills would seriously hurt his company's casinos in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Goldberg is declaring victory in a brutal, lightning-fast power play in which his supporters say he has vanquished his major New York rival, reinforced his reputation on Wall Street as a brilliant strategist and struck a deal with the St. Regis Mohawk tribe to develop the first casino in the Catskills.</p>
        <p>Many details of how the deal unfolded are laid out in a lawsuit that a Long Island businessman filed against Mr. Goldberg last month in State Supreme Court in Mineola, N.Y. At issue is whether the agreement was a result of smart politics and shrewd calculation or double-dealing and fraud.</p>
        <p>What is clear, however, is the pivotal role played by former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, as well as the labyrinthine way in which the deal developed. What began as an attempt by the Long Island businessman to use Mr. Goldberg's expertise to rescue a foundering Mohawk casino turned into a bitter split and a startling coup for Mr. Goldberg.</p>
        <p>Last summer, with the prospect of Indian gambling imminent at a site in the Catskills only 90 miles northwest of Manhattan, Mr. Goldberg wanted a quick entree to the New York market and an Indian tribe. He turned to a trusted adviser, Mr. D'Amato, who had a friend on Long Island, Ivan Kaufman, who ran the St. Regis Mohawks' money-losing casino at the Akwesasne reservation on the Canadian border.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato brought the two men together, telling Mr. Kaufman that Mr. Goldberg could solve his financial problems.</p>
        <p>But after lengthy negotiations, Mr. Goldberg wound up with everything and Mr. Kaufman was thrown off the reservation. In his lawsuit, which is on hold while the two sides conduct settlement talks, Mr. Kaufman claims that Mr. Goldberg double-crossed him, poisoning his relationship with the tribe and reneging on a $30 million deal to buy out his interest in the Akwesasne casino. Mr. Goldberg's true intention, the lawsuit says, was to curry favor with the Mohawks to gain exclusive gambling rights in the Catskills.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Goldberg announced that his company, Park Place Entertainment, and the Mohawks would seek federal approval to build a casino-resort at Kutsher's County Club, near Monticello, that would rival Foxwoods in Connecticut, the largest casino in the world. Mr. Goldberg's agreement with the tribe grants him exclusive rights to develop and manage Mohawk casinos throughout New York.</p>
        <p>The deal got a warm reception on Wall Street, but it bewildered federal officials and infuriated local legislators who have supported a separate application by the Mohawks and their original partners, Catskill Development, for a $500 million casino at the Monticello Raceway. That application was approved just last month by the Interior Department after a four-year review. But Mr. Goldberg's deal with the Mohawks threatens Catskill Development's relationship with the tribe, which has refused to comment on either proposal.</p>
        <p>Despite the optimistic declarations from Park Place, it remains unclear whether Mr. Goldberg will, or even can, build a casino. The Bureau of Indian Affairs said that Mr. Goldberg must file a new application, a process that could take two to four years.</p>
        <p>That potential delay has dissident Mohawks charging that their chiefs have been duped by Mr. Goldberg, who they say is more interested in protecting his Atlantic City casinos than in assisting the impoverished tribe. And local officials are angry about the sudden alliance between the tribe and Mr. Goldberg.</p>
        <p>''The only proposal before us is the Monticello Raceway,'' said Anthony P. Cellini, a town official, ''and we're supporting that site.''</p>
        <p>In response to accusations that he is simply out to block competition for his New Jersey casinos, Mr. Goldberg said yesterday that he fully intended to build a ''destination resort'' in the Catskills, and that he would give the Mohawks $100 million if he failed to do so after receiving government approvals.</p>
        <p>''We have the cash and the expertise to build and operate a casino tomorrow,'' he said. ''Otherwise, the Native Americans wouldn't have us up there trying to save 500 jobs.''</p>
        <p>As for the lawsuit against him, Mr. Goldberg did not rebut the claims in detail, but said: ''There's really no case. We can't help it if there's problems with a business transaction.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaufman said the whole debacle began last summer in a conversation with Mr. D'Amato, whom he did not criticize or name in his suit.</p>
        <p>''D'Amato's been a friend of ours for quite some time and he's always been helpful,'' said Mr. Kaufman, who is the president of President R.C.-St. Regis Management Company, which ran the Akwesasne casino, in Hogansburg. ''He knew we were having trouble up there. He made the introduction to Mr. Goldberg.''</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato has not returned numerous phone calls over the last four months seeking comment on his role in the casino negotiations. But Wayne Berman, his partner in the Park Strategies consulting firm, confirmed that Mr. D'Amato had introduced the two men. ''He was working as a consultant for Park Place,'' Mr. Berman said. ''We're matchmakers. Once the introduction is made, whether they decide to date, break up or get married is up to them.''</p>
        <p>On the Mohawk reservation, where unemployment ranges between 35 and 40 percent, Mr. D'Amato was a familiar figure. ''We've dealt with Mr. D'Amato many times, in and out of office,'' Gus McDonald, executive director of the St. Regis Mohawks, said in an interview this year. ''He's an old friend of ours.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McDonald would not say whether Mr. D'Amato played a role in the tribe's negotiations with Park Place, although a tribal adviser said that he was active in the talks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berman said that Mr. D'Amato stopped working for Park Place on April 14, the same day Mr. Goldberg signed a secret agreement with the six St. Regis Mohawk chiefs that granted him unusually broad casino development rights. In signing the agreement, the chiefs did not consult any of the three Washington law firms they had hired to work on gambling issues.</p>
        <p>According to the lawsuit, Mr. Kaufman first met with Mr. Goldberg last August to discuss new financing or a buyout of his stake in the Akwesasne casino, which was $10 million over budget and losing $300,000 a month. It was supposed to attract 5,000 people a day, but barely 2,000 showed up. Bills went unpaid.</p>
        <p>At a meeting in New York City last October, the suit says, Mr. Goldberg made it clear to Mr. Kaufman that his true goal was ''obtaining management rights to the tribe's casino gambling in the Catskills.'' Desperate to keep his casino afloat, Mr. Kaufman agreed to introduce Mr. Goldberg to the Mohawk chiefs only if Park Place bought his interest in the casino and gave him a stake in any future Catskill project.</p>
        <p>Around the same time, the lawsuit says, Mr. Goldberg began negotiating with Mark Kutsher to buy an option on Kutsher's County Club, one of the oldest resorts in the Catkills.</p>
        <p>Park Place's foray into the Catskills sought to supplant a deal the Mohawks had already struck with Catskill Development, a partnership that included Robert A. Berman (no relation to Wayne Berman), Joseph Bernstein and Alpha Hospitality, a casino operator. That application for 30 acres at Monticello Raceway for a casino was wending its way through the Interior Department.</p>
        <p>The proposed casino was expected to be a huge success because of its proximity to northern New Jersey and New York City. Many gambling analysts said it would compete with Atlantic City, where New Yorkers make up 40 percent of the gamblers.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Goldberg forged ahead with plans to buy Mr. Kaufman's interest in the Akwesasne casino, and by late November they had agreed to the terms of a deal worth about $30 million to Mr. Kaufman, according to the lawsuit. On Nov. 24, Mr. Goldberg made a big impression on the Mohawks when he flew into tiny Messina, N.Y., aboard his company's Gulfstream jet to meet with the tribe's six chiefs for the first time.</p>
        <p>But by February, the lawsuit says, Mr. Kaufman was having trouble keeping the Akwesasne casino open, as Mr. Goldberg slowed the negotiations and eventually whittled his $30 million offer to zero. According to the suit, Mr. Goldberg made negative comments about Mr. Kaufman to the chiefs and advised the Mohawks to break their contract with Alpha Hospitality and Catskill Development.</p>
        <p>The Interior Department approved Catskill Development's proposed casino at the Monticello Raceway on April 6, and Gov. George E. Pataki appeared ready to do the same, if settlement negotiations over the Mohawk's land claims went well. A week later, the chiefs told Thomas Aro, a vice president of Alpha Hospitality, that Park Place was interested in the raceway project.</p>
        <p>According to an executive at Alpha who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Mr. D'Amato then called his friend Mr. Tollman, the chairman of Alpha, to set up a meeting with Mr. Goldberg. Although the meeting never took place, Mr. Goldberg was moving quickly.</p>
        <p>He completed a consulting agreement with the tribe for the Akwesasne casino, and on April 14 signed the development agreement. Three days later, the tribe expelled Mr. Kaufman from the casino and revoked his gambling license, saying he had failed to comply with the tribe's gambling regulations.</p>
        <p>Catskill Development is exploring a deal with another tribe, although the Mohawks have not notified the company or the federal government that the raceway project is dead. Mr. Goldberg said neither he nor the tribe had ruled out building a temporary casino on the raceway site.</p>
        <p>But several analysts said that Mr. Goldberg has won -- whether he builds a Catskills casino that he estimates will generate more than $1 billion a year and discourage rivals from building new casinos in Atlantic City, or whether the project is delayed, perhaps forever.</p>
