        <p>Gallery X</p>
        <p>23 West 129th Street, Harlem</p>
        <p>Through Sunday</p>
        <p>This small show of photography and sculpture is a father-and-son collaboration. The pictures, printed from slides, were taken by the journalist Wallace Terry in 1968 and 1969 while on assignment for Time in South Vietnam. The sculptures are by his son, David, a New York  artist now in his early 30's.</p>
        <p>The pictures include images of wounded civilians and soldiers from both sides in the war and shots that underscore the pervasive racism in the United States military. The sculptures, most of them recent, were made in response to the photos, with which they are aligned in the installation.</p>

        <p>Gallery X</p>

        <p>Through Sunday</p>
        <p>This small show of photography and sculpture is a father-and-son collaboration. The pictures, printed from slides, were taken by the journalist Wallace Terry in 1968 and 1969 while on assignment for Time in South Vietnam. The sculptures are by his son, David, a New York  artist now in his early 30's.</p>
        <p>The pictures include images of wounded civilians and soldiers from both sides in the war and shots that underscore the pervasive racism in the United States military. The sculptures, most of them recent, were made in response to the photos, with which they are aligned in the installation.</p>
        <p>Displayed under an image of a Vietnamese child who lost an eye when his village was shelled is a small pair of protective glasses carved from white marble. Near a picture of African-American marines with arms raised in a black power salute is a cast plaster helmet stuck with an Afro comb.</p>
        <p>This kind of point-for-point lineup could easily turn into into leaden illustration, but that isn't the effect. Rather than competing with the photographs, which form a terse critical essay on their own, the sculptures stay witty, almost toylike. They suggest a child's impression of distant catastrophe, at once fanciful and perceptive, which is the view the younger Mr. Terry had of the war his father documented firsthand.</p>
