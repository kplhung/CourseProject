        <p>For the second time in five months, the state's highest court today said the Giuliani administration was overzealous in enforcing a zoning law that restricted sex-related businesses, this time batting down a city attempt to close a topless bar in Chelsea.</p>
        <p>The Court of Appeals found unanimously that the VIP Club at 20 West 20th Street had successfully skirted the rules on X-rated businesses by turning most of its space into a restaurant and bar, limiting the area where it had topless dancers. Today's opinion mirrors a case decided in December, when the Court of Appeals ruled against the city's bid to shut down a pornographic video and book store on the Upper West Side.</p>
        <p>Today's decision was the first to explore how the new zoning law applied to topless dancing. Simon H. Rothkrug, the lawyer for the VIP Club, said the ruling applied to 25 to 50 clubs citywide that used the same strategy to get around the law. He said that tonight the club's dancers would take off the latex body suits and bikinis they have had to wear since the city first tried to close the club in November.</p>
        <p>''It's another victory for First Amendment freedom of expression rights,'' Mr. Rothkrug said, ''and hopefully it will put an end to the city's heavy-handed efforts to punish the VIP Club.''</p>
        <p>Steven M. Fishner, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's criminal justice coordinator, released a statement accusing the court of ''making it possible for some businesses to evade the law's clear purpose.'' The city ''will continue vigorous enforcement,'' he said, and would consider changes in the law to circumvent the rulings, to ensure ''that our residences, schools and places of worship remain far from the shadows cast by strip clubs and other sex-related businesses.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani fought for the 1995 zoning law, hoping to reduce the number of pornographic businesses and push them into industrial areas. According to officials, the city has shuttered more than 60 of the 145 sex-related businesses in New York since 1998, when the city began enforcing the law after it was upheld by the United States Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>But that campaign hit a snag because the law said it applied only to stores and clubs where ''a substantial portion'' of the space was devoted to X-rated commerce. The idea was to exempt an ordinary video or book store that might have a shelf or two of sexually graphic material.</p>
        <p>The city adopted a rule that defined ''a substantial portion'' as 40 percent or more of a store's shelves, floor space or inventory. Pornographic video stores then filled 60 percent of their space with kung fu tapes and Hollywood flops, while places like the VIP Club restricted nude or topless dancers to 40 percent or less of their floor space. The city called that ''sham compliance'' and tried to close them.</p>
        <p>But in December, the Court of Appeals found that the rule must be taken literally, and that the city did not have the right to say that technical compliance was not good enough. The city responded early this year by altering that rule to say that no more than 40 percent of a store's revenues could come from X-rated material -- a rule that store owners have promised to challenge in court.</p>
        <p>Today's decision also turned on the 60/40 rule. The VIP Club's owner, Dezer Entertainment Concepts, redesigned the club so that topless dancers were only on the mezzanine level, which encompassed 36 percent of floor space. The mezzanine, Mr. Rothkrug said, was above and invisible from the main floor, which was turned into a bar and restaurant. (New York State's liquor law prohibits completely nude entertainers in a business where alcohol is served.)</p>
        <p>Once again, the city relied on the ''sham compliance'' argument and argued that the 60/40 rule did not apply to topless clubs.</p>
        <p>Today, the Court of Appeals, in a short, unsigned decision, said the 60/40 rule did apply, and that the Appellate Division had no business taking up the question of whether this was ''sham compliance.'' The court pointed to its December decision that the rule must be applied literally.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rothkrug accused the city of singling out the VIP Club for enforcement while the case went through the courts, putting it at a competitive disadvantage. ''We've been padlocked on a couple of occasions,'' he said. ''We are the only club that has not been allowed to be topless on a 60/40 basis for the last six months, pending the appeals.''</p>
