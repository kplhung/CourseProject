        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Recalling a Victory for the Disabled'' (news article, May 3) gives the impression that there has been little progress in services for people with developmental disabilities after the closing of Willowbrook State School.</p>
        <p>Before the closing, children like my son, who has significant developmental disabilities, were warehoused, starved, left filthy, beaten. Now, 25 years later, people with disabilities live in small group homes, alongside non-disabled neighbors. They shop at their local supermarket, go to the movies, hold jobs.</p>
        <p>True, there is still plenty of room for improvement. But on the whole, the quality of life for most people with developmental disabilities has improved tremendously. And incidents of abuse are now the exception, not the rule.</p>
