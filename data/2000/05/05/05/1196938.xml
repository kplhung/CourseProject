        <p>Some dreams fade slowly. Surrounded by all the clamor of the 126th Kentucky Derby, Harold Rose clings to his dream of a lifetime. At 88, he still hopes to win the Derby with Hal's Hope, the horse he bred, owns and trains.</p>
        <p>Three weeks after winning the Florida Derby, Hal's Hope and his homespun family reigned as the new stars of racing's oldest show. That was until something happened in the homestretch of the Blue Grass a month later, when Hal's Hope was eased through the stretch by his jockey, Roger Velez, and finished last. The dreamers were left to wonder why.</p>
        <p>But Rose loaded his horse into a van and joined the march on Churchill Downs, and sure enough, he found an answer: Hal's Hope apparently scuffed his heels -- ran down, in racetrack terms -- during his grinding duel with High Yield, the eventual winner, in the Blue Grass. And every step he took caused pain on the road to Louisville.</p>
        <p>So, Rose bandaged the colt's hind legs and then watched Hal's Hope fly through a sizzling workout on Sunday: half a mile in 462/5  seconds. That workout may not produce an upset over Fusaichi Pegasus or The Deputy or any of the other major horses in the Derby, but it rekindled the flame in Hal Rose's dream.</p>
        <p>Suddenly it seemed that a great burden had been lifted from the stable. The horse was still listed at long odds of 20-1 by the Churchill Downs linemaker, and nobody was bold enough to predict an upset. But at Barn 42, the old man and his dream were back in bloom.</p>
        <p>''I've got to believe he's back where he should be,'' Rose said with the exuberance of a teenager.</p>
        <p>Velez, who rode Hal's Hope in the workout, as he always does, affirmed his faith by saying, ''This was the real Hal's Hope.''</p>
        <p>By then, the story of the people around the horse had become a kind of racing legend: The 88-year-old owner and breeder who also trains his own horses, mostly claimers, in his barn of about 20, a kind man who sustained a heart attack and a stroke last year, a man whose adventures were being recorded in book form by his 85-year-old wife, Elsie. And the 42-year-old jockey, who, while recovering from alcohol problems and a stroke that he had last year, became the horse's constant companion.</p>
        <p>Wherever they went, the public responded as though they were astronauts or rock stars. When Rose was called to the stage at Keeneland's dinner the night before the Blue Grass, he received a standing ovation. When he was introduced at the trainers' dinner this week, his fellow trainers stood and cheered. When he advanced to the podium to make his selection for the Derby draw, the audience gave him a long ovation. Every morning, when he holds court at his barn, next to the one that houses Fusaichi Pegasus, he faces a rapt audience.</p>
        <p>This morning, after Velez had taken the shining brown colt for his mile-and-a-half gallop, Rose watched from an observation stand on the backstretch and then sat on a plastic chair outside his barn.</p>
        <p>''All's good,'' he said. ''He's back on track and coming right along. I don't have a whole lot else to do with him. I'm not even going to paddock him. He doesn't need it. He's a pro with that stuff.''</p>
        <p>His ''pro'' reached that level by winning four of nine races, including two stakes this year in Florida: the Holy Bull by 5 lengths at 40-1 and the Florida Derby by a neck. But he was even more renowned as the centerpiece of a trainer's storybook dream.</p>
        <p>''My legs are getting just a bit tired lately,'' Rose explained this morning, apologizing for sitting down. ''Many, in fact most, of the people I grew up with are gone now. But racing has kept me sharp mentally and fairly much so physically. It has kept me young. Some folks have asked me this week if I'd think of retiring. I tell them to check back with me when I reach 100.''</p>
        <p>Nodding toward Hal's Hope, who was named for him, Rose said: ''The wraps are there to protect his back legs from running down. He'll run in them in the Derby. He might have run down some at Keeneland in the Blue Grass. But his work here was just like the move he put in prior to the Florida Derby. So, I've got to believe he's back where he should be.''</p>
        <p>If so, if Hal's Hope makes his owner's hope a reality, Rose would become the Derby's oldest winning trainer. Charlie Whittingham was 76 when Sunday Silence scored in 1989. And he would provide a smash ending to Elsie Rose's book about her man and his dreams.</p>
