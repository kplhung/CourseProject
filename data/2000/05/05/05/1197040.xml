        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki today released the details of his plan to restrict the state's ability to borrow, including a provision that would prohibit the state from using borrowed money for anything other than capital projects.</p>
        <p>The governor and legislative leaders agreed Tuesday on a plan that would, for the first time, overhaul the state's borrowing practices. But they provided few details beyond saying that the plan would impose a cap on the amount of debt the state could  carry at any one time.</p>
        <p>The prohibition on borrowing for anything other than capital projects like building highways is meant to prevent previous revenue-raising gimmicks, like when the state sold the Attica prison to itself to generate cash, or when it borrowed money to meet routine operating needs.</p>
        <p>The governor also detailed a provision that prohibits the state from carrying any new debt for longer than 30 years, instead of the current 40-year limit. Mr. Pataki's aides said that provision would help limit the amount the state spends on interest. But its impact is far from clear, since the state has very little debt longer than 20 years right now.</p>
        <p>The agreement on the debt reform plan helped open the way for passage of the state budget. Mr. Pataki had refused to sign off on a final budget deal until the leaders of the Legislature agreed on a plan restricting the state's ability to borrow.</p>
        <p>The governor released the details of his plan as both houses of the Legislature began passing the $77.5 billion state budget, 33 days overdue.</p>
        <p>The debt issue is extremely important to Mr. Pataki, largely because he has been criticized sharply by conservative groups for increasing the state's overall indebtedness, even as the state has amassed multibillion-dollar budget surpluses over the last few years.</p>
        <p>New York's debt has grown by more than 30 percent since the governor took office in 1995, bringing the total to more than $37 billion, the largest for any state. The debt is one of the major reasons the state's credit rating on Wall Street is among the poorest in the nation. The state pays nearly $4 billion a year for debt service.</p>
        <p>The plan would restrict the state's outstanding debt to no more than 4 percent of New York residents' personal income, compared with the current 6 percent.</p>
