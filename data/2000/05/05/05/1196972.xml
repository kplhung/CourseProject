        <p>Harvey Schiller learned football from Al Davis at the Citadel, flew 1,200 support missions in Vietnam and ran the Southeastern Conference, the United States Olympic Committee and Turner Sports.</p>
        <p>But in his new job, the former chairman of the Air Force Academy's chemistry department has never been under more scrutiny.</p>
        <p>Being the chairman of YankeeNets is, of course, a high-profile job. So far it has meant pitching YankeeNets junk bonds, acquiring the Devils for $175 million and securing a deal for a Newark site for an arena for the Nets and the Devils.</p>
        <p>''It's wall-to-wall activity,'' Schiller said, noting the inquiries from dot-coms, entertainment companies, European television networks and restaurants seeking business arrangements with YankeeNets.</p>
        <p>He is also trying to keep Lou Lamoriello as the Devils' general manager.</p>
        <p>''We've met, we want to keep him and we've discussed financial terms,'' he said. ''But we also understand that Lou's a marketable commodity.''</p>
        <p>Schiller left Turner Sports last year to join YankeeNets, where his five-year contract will pay him $2 million annually; he also has an option to buy 3 percent of the company. But what is fascinating -- or curious -- about his decision to change jobs is that he now works for and with his friend George Steinbrenner.</p>
        <p>Schiller displays no jitters over working for his demanding friend and for higher stakes than they did when Schiller ran the U.S.O.C. from 1990 to 1994 and Steinbrenner was a vocal vice president. Schiller's candor and no-nonsense, military demeanor seem to guard against his caring about Steinbrenner's furies.</p>
        <p>''We share feelings about doing things the right way and about patriotism,'' Schiller, 61, a retired Air Force colonel, said yesterday in his Rockefeller Plaza office. ''He has a lot of confidence in me, and my ability to do the job, and I have a lot of confidence in his ability to support the work I do.''</p>
        <p>For those seeking amicable relations with Steinbrenner, Schiller has a suggestion: ''A call to ask, 'How're you doing?' is great.''</p>
        <p>Recently, Schiller said, he told Steinbrenner that he would be meeting his daughter's new boyfriend. Soon after, Schiller and his wife, Marcia, were shopping in Costco when his cell phone rang.</p>
        <p>''I thought I was part of your family,'' a voice said sternly. Schiller needed a few seconds for it to register that Steinbrenner was demanding a report on whether his daughter's beau had passed the family test.</p>
        <p>''You never called me,'' Steinbrenner said, admonishingly. ''So, is he in the family or not?''</p>
        <p>Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports, said Schiller's military training defines how he relates to life -- and to Steinbrenner.</p>
        <p>''After flying jets at 500 or 600 miles per hour, everything is pressure-free,'' Ebersol said. ''There just isn't anything in life that will stop him from being Ramrod Harvey.''</p>
        <p>George Gowen, president of the U.S.O.C. Foundation, said of the Schiller-Steinbrenner relationship: ''At times, there has been some barking back and forth, but any moments of frustration were minuscule. They know how to live together in a business atmosphere.''</p>
        <p>And Schiller is willing to leave an atmosphere he plainly dislikes. One day after becoming the U.S.O.C.'s executive director in 1988, he resigned, uncomfortable with the politics and structure of the organization. After internal changes within the U.S.O.C., he returned nearly two years later.</p>
        <p>''He's the most forthright, honest person I know,'' said Paul Maguire, the ESPN football announcer who was Schiller's roommate and teammate at the Citadel. ''He was a terrible player, but once he got there, he just stayed.''</p>
        <p>People who know Schiller cite eccentricities like his replacing the style-deprived ties of some employees and interrupting meetings to draw chemical formulas that illustrate his point.</p>
        <p>Few sports executives can apply scientific methodology, learned from earning a doctorate in chemistry, to managing teams, or can discuss mass spectroscopies, aspect ratios and energy transfers. ''He's been known to splash uric acid on the conference table,'' joked John Krimsky, the U.S.O.C.'s former top marketer who is YankeeNets' chief marketing officer.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner's evaluation of Schiller will ultimately hinge on his ability to turn YankeeNets into a corporate megaforce that goes beyond wins and losses. For the near term, that will mean launching a YankeeNets regional cable channel and building the $295 million Newark arena.</p>
        <p>''Our goal is to fully exploit our rights, which means building a network,'' Schiller said. He all but ruled out another traditional rights deal like the 12-year, $486 million one between the Yankees and the MSG Network that concludes after this season.</p>
        <p>The new network would be a venture with a company like Time Warner, Disney or Cablevision, which owns MSG, and would carry games of the Yankees, the Nets (after 2002) and the Devils (after 2007) as well as entertainment programs. ''Our goal is to finalize something in the next few weeks,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Regarding the arena, Schiller said he hoped that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's approval will be forthcoming. But if she does not agree to the $75 million public investment, he said, ''Other places may want the teams.''</p>
        <p>YankeeNets has collected financial information about the Meadowlands. Whether YankeeNets wants to build a Nascar track or keep the Meadowlands from competing with the Newark arena is not known. For now, the complex is not for sale.</p>
        <p>''We have an interest in the Meadowlands for various reasons,'' Schiller said cryptically. ''What happens with the track may be of interest.''</p>
        <p>One project outside Schiller's purview is deciding whether the Yankees stay in the Bronx or try to move to the West Side of Manhattan, a site coveted by Steinbrenner since 1994. ''That's being directed by George,'' Schiller said.</p>
        <p>But there's enough to engage him. At Wednesday night's Devils-Toronto playoff game, Marcia Schiller asked why he was so distracted.</p>
        <p>''I was thinking about what will happen when we move,'' he said, referring to the move of the Nets and the Devils. ''How do we keep the enthusiasm? Will we lose some of our fan base and add another? George's instruction is to keep the fans happy.''</p>
