        <p>China told a United Nations human rights panel today that it had made progress in preventing torture and in prosecuting officials suspected of such abuse but conceded that it could do more.</p>
        <p>Rebutting criticism from a human rights group, Qiao Zonghuai, China's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, said that stronger laws, more training for the judiciary and improved investigating methods had resulted in fewer torture cases in recent years.</p>
        <p>But he said: ''China's legal system still needs to be improved, and there are still weak links in our system of judicial supervision. These problems pose obstacles to the eradication of torture in China.''</p>
