        <p>THE FIG EATER  By Jody Shields  311 pages. Little, Brown &amp; Company. $23.95.</p>
        <p>On a hot August night in fin de siecle Vienna, an 18-year-old girl is found murdered in the Volksgarten, near the park's statue of Franz Josef's assassinated wife. Her name, we learn, is Dora, just like Freud's famous patient, whom he unsuccessfully treated for hysteria in 1900.</p>
        <p>In her first novel Jody Shields has substituted a fictional murder investigation for Freud's process of psychoanalysis, and in doing so, she has turned the quest to understand Dora's past into a chilling tale of detection, betrayal and failed ratiocination. For all its red herrings and contrived curlicues, the novel's tale  immerses the reader in the fetid, overripe atmosphere of Vienna, limning the dark, chaotic impulses that lurk beneath its facade of stuffy bourgeois morality.</p>

        <p>THE FIG EATER  By Jody Shields  311 pages. Little, Brown &amp; Company. $23.95.</p>
        <p>On a hot August night in fin de siecle Vienna, an 18-year-old girl is found murdered in the Volksgarten, near the park's statue of Franz Josef's assassinated wife. Her name, we learn, is Dora, just like Freud's famous patient, whom he unsuccessfully treated for hysteria in 1900.</p>
        <p>In her first novel Jody Shields has substituted a fictional murder investigation for Freud's process of psychoanalysis, and in doing so, she has turned the quest to understand Dora's past into a chilling tale of detection, betrayal and failed ratiocination. For all its red herrings and contrived curlicues, the novel's tale  immerses the reader in the fetid, overripe atmosphere of Vienna, limning the dark, chaotic impulses that lurk beneath its facade of stuffy bourgeois morality.</p>
        <p>There are two teams of detectives trying to find Dora's murderer and unravel the mystery of her death. The first is headed by the Inspector, a police detective, who, like Freud, thinks of himself as a trained observer, a professional listener, adept at eliciting the secrets of witnesses and suspects. The Inspector is assisted by a young police officer named Franz, a bumbling fellow, eager to master the tricks of the trade; and by Egon, a brooding photographer who may have a hidden agenda.</p>
        <p>The second team, led by the Inspector's Hungarian wife, Erszebet, works in secret. Erszebet, who has become obsessed with the case, furtively reads her husband's notes on the murder, and she enlists the help of a strange young woman named Wally to follow leads the police have neglected. She believes that the figs discovered in Dora's stomach during the police autopsy hold a key to her murder, and begins researching the mythology of this talismanic fruit associated with fertility and sex.</p>
        <p>Whereas the Inspector employs the tools of logic, analysis and careful deliberation, Erszebet relies on Gypsy superstition and clairvoyance to try to decipher clues. For the Inspector, solving the case means imposing order on the seemingly random events that led to a young woman's death; for Erszebet, solving the case means uncovering the frightening labyrinth of secrets surrounding Dora and her family.</p>
        <p>This juxtaposition of reason and emotion, male rationality and female intuition, is doubtless meant to represent the contradictory impulses seething in the city of Vienna, but it often feels like an overly schematic armature for Ms. Shields's bizarre imaginings. The novel is peppered with willfully perverse images: a thumb severed from Dora's corpse after she is buried; nude photos of a disfigured young woman (who may or may not be Dora) discovered in the files of a doctor who specializes in sexual dysfunction; the sinister movements of a servant whose nose has been eaten away by syphilis.</p>
        <p>Such developments are gratuitous as well, particularly because the details of the real Dora's life are so unsettling on their own: a syphilitic father having an affair with the wife of his best friend, Herr K., who in turn was making unwanted sexual overtures toward the teenaged Dora; a chilly mother, obsessed with the cleanliness of her house and unaccountably close to Dora's brother; and an unsympathetic psychiatrist (Freud) who showed little sensitivity to the emotional plight of his patient, suggesting that she suffered from repressed feelings for the predatory Herr K.</p>
        <p>Yet if Ms. Shields -- a former design editor at The New York Times Magazine and the author of two fashion books -- needlessly adorns these facts with gothic embroiderings, she nonetheless manages to turn the investigation of Dora's past into a suspenseful drama. Cutting back and forth between the efforts of various characters to track down clues, she creates a cinematic narrative even as she gives the reader a palpable sense of fin de siecle Vienna: a city of gray stone and gray fogs; a city of pedestrians where people promenade twice daily ''in front of the grand hotels by the Staatsoper, along the Ring and under the double rows of horse chestnut trees in the Prater.''</p>
        <p>It is a city of archaic social rituals and experimental art, old pieties and new scientific theories; a city lurching into modernity but ''positioned over crypts and burial vaults hollowed out under its churches,'' where thousands of plague victims were once interred.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shields's fictional portrait of Dora and her family clearly lacks the real-life resonance of Hannah S. Decker's fascinating 1990 study of Freud's actual case (''Freud, Dora and Vienna 1900,'' Free Press), but in turning Dora's story into a murder mystery, Ms. Shields has managed to write a gripping psychological thriller while capturing the nervous mood of a city preoccupied, like one of its most famous residents, with sex and death.</p>
