        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The slaying and kidnapping of United Nations troops in Sierra Leone by the Revolutionary United Front (front page, May 4) must be strongly denounced. However, it did not come as a surprise.</p>
        <p>Since 1991, the rebel group has been killing, mutilating and raping hundreds of thousands of civilians and peacekeepers without much attention from the rest of the world. The United Nations and the United States made a grave mistake in endorsing the Lome peace agreement, which made the perpetrators of these atrocities part of the government.</p>
        <p>Foday Sankoh, the rebels' leader, could and should be charged with war crimes. Amnesty is inapplicable under international law, and does not cover the group's atrocities committed after the agreement.</p>
        <p>The Revolutionary United Front should not be in government; it should be before a tribunal.</p>
        <p>ABDUL TEJAN-COLE  New York, May 4, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is secretary general of the Sierra Leone Bar Association.</p>
