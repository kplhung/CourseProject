        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.  + means discounted tickets were available at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth last weekend for performances last Friday and Saturday nights.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>* ''CONTACT.'' The most potent antidepressant available in New York. Advertising has it that this show from the director and choreographer Susan Stroman is a ''dance play,'' but that hardly captures how it makes you feel. Aided by the dramatist John Weidman and a dream ensemble, Ms. Stroman has created the unthinkable: a sexy, polished work that restores the pleasure principle to the American musical. A theatrical portfolio of three seemingly unrelated vignettes set in different time periods, with top-drawer leading performances from Boyd Gaines, Deborah Yates and Karen Ziemba, ''Contact'' uses an ingeniously selected medley of recordings ranging from Bizet to the Beach Boys. But like a classic Rodgers and Hart musical it converts the messy daily ingredients of sexual attraction and conflict into something as smoothly sweet and tart as a Key lime pie. Both the intoxication of love and the hangover of loneliness are given idealized, elegant form (2:00). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $80 (Ben Brantley).</p>

        <p>* ''COPENHAGEN.'' Who would ever have thought it: that three dead, long-winded people talking about atomic physics would be such electrifying companions? Michael Frayn's endlessly fascinating speculation on the ambiguity of human motives and the limits of scientific knowledge takes on a subject that would seem to have the sex appeal of a frozen flounder: a meeting in 1941 between the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Philip Bosco) and Werner Heisenberg (Michael Cumpsty), his former protege and a German, during which no one, to this day, knows exactly what happened. Mr. Frayn turns the encounter among the men and Bohr's wife, Margrethe (Blair Brown), into a wide-ranging, intensely emotional consideration of everything from quantum mechanics to the loss of a child, from the fate of the world in the atomic age to the nature of friendship. Under the meticulous direction of Michael Blakemore, with three fiercely passionate performances, the result is a most invigorating and ingenious play of ideas (2:20). Royale, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50 to $65; $25 student rush tickets at box office on day of performance (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''DIRTY BLONDE.'' A wonderfully warmblooded new play about the importance of being (and worshiping) Mae West, that steel tomato of a sex goddess. This smart, tough and tenderhearted comedy, written by and starring Claudia Shear, traces both the developing friendship between two West idolizers, the kind for whom swapped movie dialogue constitutes a conversation, and the career of the tenacious Mae. As Jo (Ms. Shear), a brassy sometime actress, and Charlie (the excellent Kevin Chamberlin), a shy film archivist, use their shared obsession with West to find themselves and each other, ''Dirty Blonde'' completely conjures an iconic personality in a way more earnest stage biographies seldom manage. The protean Bob Stillman and Mr. Chamberlin play a wild assortment of the men in the life of West, who is embodied from steamroller youth to gothic old age by Ms. Shear. Stylishly staged by James Lapine, the evening makes it winningly clear that being a caricature doesn't mean you can't be a character, too (1:45). Helen Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6262. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $60 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>+ ''THE GREEN BIRD.'' If the Tony Awards had a category for best performance by a piece of fruit in a musical role, there's no question which current Broadway show would provide the winner. Ditto for best performance by a masked actor denied the use of the upper two-thirds of his face. And for best use of eyelids by an oversize statue. These unlikely nominees are among the highlights of ''The Green Bird,'' Julie Taymor's alternately enchanting and tedious adaptation of Carlo Gozzi's 18th-century fable. Ms. Taymor, who directed ''The Lion King,'' here sets her sights on an adult audience with a childlike capacity for wonder. Unfortunately, her sense of the transcendent moment is much stronger than her gift for narrative, and it can feel like a long wait between miracles. Among the human cast members Derek Smith is terrific as a melancholy monarch (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45 to $75 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>+ ''JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR.'' People who insist that where there's smoke there's fire haven't sat through this 30th-anniversary staging of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's rock-opera-cum-passion play, a production in which the flame of imagination definitely burns low. This revival, which originated in Britain and is directed by Gale Edwards, features lots of acrid stage smoke, a giant cross made of high-wattage light bulbs and video images of the torture and crucifixion of its title character, played here by a passive and petulant Glenn Carter. What it doesn't have is a single original idea. The score and lyrics still pulse with a freshness and audacity, but you would be better off buying the 1970 recording (2:20). Ford, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $80 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''THE MUSIC MAN.'' A show that makes you feel ridiculously happy one instant and seriously sleepy the next. The director and choreographer Susan Stroman, who created the inspired dance-musical ''Contact,'' isn't as confident in her take on Meredith Willson's jubilant story of a traveling con man who brings rhythm to the stolid town of River City, Iowa. Her transforming imagination stops when the music stops. The production has two perfectly agreeable stars in Craig Bierko, in the title role, and Rebecca Luker, as the frosty librarian who learns to melt. But you get the impression that most of the people onstage are just pretending to live in a land of cornfed propriety and corny jokes, marking time until a production number comes along to let them show their stuff. When the show is singing or, especially, dancing, it often seems to have winged feet; when it's just talking or clowning around, those feet are flat (2:50). Simon, 250 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $20 and $85 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''THE REAL THING.'' This immensely appealing revival of the Tom Stoppard play, from the Donmar Warehouse in London, is a rare thing even in what has been an exceptionally strong season for straight plays: an elegant comedy of infidelity filled with the sort of comebacks that people only wish they were capable of themselves. True, Mr. Stoppard's anatomy of a cerebral (and anachronistically romantic) playwright, played with all-conquering charm by Stephen Dillane, is also always subverting itself, pointing out how some things, love among them, defy glib articulation. But, ah, how articulately it manages to say so. If its structural game playing seems a tad too clever this time, few comedies have  managed to have it so successfully both ways. David Leveaux is the highly accomplished director, while the delectable Jennifer Ehle, a standout in an exceptionally polished cast, plays the object of Mr. Dillane's affections (2:15). Ethel Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $70 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''THE RIDE DOWN MOUNT MORGAN.'' As Lyman Felt, the joyously eloquent, sexually rapacious and relentlessly self-justifying bigamist at this ride's center, Patrick Stewart makes a fine devil for a new millennium. A man who wants everything and can deny himself nothing, Lyman suffers as a result, but in the end, well, the pleasure of living his carefully maintained double life was probably worth its ultimate destruction. In intelligent and savage satire, the play makes a pretty good case for bigamy as a lifestyle choice. And it is the achievement of Mr. Stewart that such stunning amorality seems nearly reasonable. It's hard to imagine a more sympathetic creep (2:10). Ambassador, 215 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $65 (Bruce Weber).</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>* ''JITNEY.'' ''Don't put your business in the street,'' advises a character in this splendidly acted production of August Wilson's early comic drama about a gypsy-cab company in Pittsburgh. As if that were remotely possible in the Hill District, the setting of Mr. Wilson's cycle of plays about the black American experience in the 20th century and a place where private business is always on parade: real life is always the best show in town. ''Jitney,'' which has been extensively revised since its  first production in 1982, could be described as just a lot of men sitting around talking. But the talk has such varied range and musicality, and it is rendered with such stylish detail, that a complete urban symphony emerges. There are occasional whiffs of standard-issue melodrama. But under Marion McClinton's sensitive direction, every performer shines as a soloist and as a member of the chorus. It's the finest ensemble work of the season (2:35). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 7 p.m.; and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $41 and $51 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''OUR LADY OF SLIGO.'' The great Irish actress Sinead Cusack plays Mai O'Hara, the raging, terminally ill heroine of this drama by Sebastian Barry. And from the production's opening seconds, when Mai abruptly sits upright in her hospital bed, this great Irish actress floods the stage with a magnetic force of will that makes you at once want to lean toward her and pull back. ''Sligo,'' while notable for its poetic patterns and phrases, has its stale and repetitive stretches. But Ms. Cusack, who appears far too seldom on these shores, is giving one of those performances that keeps replaying itself in your mind. Her self-destructive, alcoholic Mai thinks too much and too little of herself to try to charm. But under the tender direction of Max Stafford-Clark, Ms. Cusack's performance burns white-hot, a blinding light amid mortal darkness (2:20). Irish Repertory, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 and $40 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''THE WAVERLY GALLERY.'' If there is solace to be found in this finely observed, surprisingly funny story of the predations of old age, it is in the octogenarian Eileen Heckart's ability to provide such a beautifully coherent portrayal of an octogenarian woman sliding into incoherence. Less a conventional drama than an autobiographical essay given dramatic form, this new work from Kenneth Lonergan, the author of ''This Is Our Youth,'' is nonetheless deeply theatrical, a memory play in the classic sense (a la ''Glass Menagerie'') as well as a play about memory and how it fails us. The show's top-flight cast, which features Maureen Anderman and Josh Hamilton and is directed by Scott Ellis, makes a skillful, subtle argument for senility as an exaggerated state of the natural human condition. And Ms. Heckart, in rendering her character's confusion with such clarity, scores a point for art over time every night. So, in its modest way, does Mr. Lonergan's play (2:00). Promenade, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $55 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Long-Running: Broadway</p>
        <p>Here are summaries of reviews by Ben Brantley and Peter Marks:</p>
        <p>''MISS SAIGON.'' In some ways, age has both mellowed and invigorated this show. The staging by the director, Nicholas Hytner, is as sure and crisp as ever; for all the jokes over the years about the musical's helicopter, the second-act evacuation scene that deploys it remains a stunner (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $80; $20 rush tickets at the box office.</p>
        <p>* ''STOMP.'' This joyous percussive show, danced to the music of clanging bric-a-brac you find in your garage, is as crisp and exuberant as if it had opened yesterday. The performers remain an exhilarating precision marching band of working stiffs (1:45). Orpheum, 126 Second Avenue, near Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 477-2477. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 7 and 10:30 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $29.50 and $49.50.</p>
