        <p>The Transportation Department is expected to announce new standards for automobile air bags on Friday, allowing less powerful bags that would reduce the risk to children and small adults, possibly at the expense of men who drive without seatbelts.</p>
        <p>The government rejected some safety experts' arguments that the automakers should use a more sophisticated air bag that would offer protection to a wider range of body types and in a wider range of accident speeds, said people involved in the decision.</p>
        <p>After numerous reports three years ago of children being killed by air bags, officials decided that the devices would have to be less powerful ''to minimize the risk of that happening again,'' a senior Transportation Department official said.</p>
        <p>The rule will take effect for the 2004 model year.</p>
        <p>Beginning with 1988 model cars, the bags were designed to protect a 183-pound male in head-on collisions at 30 miles per hour. But to inflate fast enough to do the job, some bags moved at 200 m.p.h.</p>
        <p>After the toll on children and small women became obvious, the department rushed through a temporary rule in March 1997, saying manufacturers could reduce the bags' power by up to 35 percent.</p>
        <p>Although the new rule requires that unbelted occupants be protected only in crashes up to 25 m.p.h., less than the standard it is replacing, it adds some new requirements.</p>
        <p>It requires new tests with dummies representing 1-, 3- and 6-year-olds, as well as a 112-pound woman, said people knowledgeable about the regulation. The new rule will also add a test in which the barrier that the vehicle hits covers only about half of the front of the car, concentrating the impact forces on a smaller area and making it harder to keep the passenger compartment intact.</p>
        <p>The new rule tightens, as well, the criteria used to decide when an injury would be caused, reducing the severity of the forces a dummy can experience and still pass the test. And it requires that the bags not deploy in low-speed crashes.</p>
        <p>The department had originally sought a 30-mile-an-hour standard, but the car makers asked for the change and the White House agreed, a department official said.</p>
        <p>Safety advocates were divided about the decision for a 25 m.p.h. standard. Some said it would reduce the number of people killed by air bags, which safety authorities say now total 152, including 92 children.</p>
        <p>''We have a higher obligation to kids,'' said Chuck Hurley, a spokesman for the National Safety Council. Men could cut their risk very sharply, Mr. Hurley said, simply by buckling their seatbelts.</p>
        <p>Others said the government should have required the use of ''smart'' air bags, which inflate at different speeds depending on the severity of the impact, the weight of the driver or passenger and whether the occupant is belted. Some experts think that, under the new standard, an air bag will not be able to absorb the energy of, say, a 200-pound man flung against it in a severe collision.</p>
        <p>Joan Claybrook, the president of Public Citizen, a nonprofit lobbying group, and a former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, opposed the reduction to 25 m.p.h.</p>
        <p>Ms. Claybrook said that for automakers, the 30-m.p.h. rule posed a problem for their sport utility vehicles. The vehicles have very stiff front ends that do not absorb crash energy, and so need air bags that are so powerful that they can kill people, she said.</p>
        <p>''The manufacturers don't want to redesign these cash cows because of the cost and the enormous popularity of the vehicles,'' Public Citizen said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Ms. Claybrook said that 55 percent of the people saved by air bags annually were in crashes above 25 m.p.h., and that two-thirds of the people saved were not wearing seatbelts.</p>
        <p>She pointed out that 80 million cars already on the road had air bags designed to protect an unbelted male at 30 m.p.h.</p>
        <p>''Now they say, 'Gee whiz, we can't meet that 30-mile standard because it might be dangerous,' '' she said. If that is the case, she said, the automakers should recall the 80 million cars.</p>
        <p>At Consumers Union, the nonprofit group that publishes Consumer Reports, Sally J. Greenberg, a senior product safety specialist, also said that making the bags weaker to protect small occupants was a mistake.</p>
        <p>''It's not an either-or proposition,'' Ms. Greenberg said. ''They can do both.''</p>
        <p>Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Acura models already have air bags that deploy at variable speeds, she said.</p>
