        <p>As the steady, months-long speculation over who would become New York's next archbishop grew with the death of Cardinal John O'Connor, there were few clues to whom Pope John Paul II will name to the job he once described as ''archbishop of the most powerful country in the world.''</p>

        <p>As the steady, months-long speculation over who would become New York's next archbishop grew with the death of Cardinal John O'Connor, there were few clues to whom Pope John Paul II will name to the job he once described as ''archbishop of the most powerful country in the world.''</p>
        <p>But in the hundreds of churches, hospitals, shelters and schools that make up the nation's third-largest archdiocese, where stark changes have essentially redrawn the map of Catholic New York in the twilight of Cardinal O'Connor's 16-year term, there is little question that daunting challenges will face the man who succeeds Cardinal O'Connor.</p>
        <p>How will the new archbishop, who will become spiritual shepherd of 2.4 million Catholics, adapt to the scarcity of new priests? How will he answer the spectacular mushrooming of languages and cultures across an archdiocese that spans Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island, along with seven counties north of the city? Which schools and parishes, if any, will he merge and which will he shut down, as financial decisions, once put off, demand action?</p>
        <p>A Vatican official in Rome said yesterday that Pope John Paul II was given a final list of recommendations for New York's next archbishop after a Feb. 24 meeting of the Congregation of Bishops, a group that includes cardinals and some bishops. Church officials in the United States said last night that the successor had been chosen but had not been announced in what has generally been taken as a sign of the pope's affection and esteem for Cardinal O'Connor. An announcement is not expected until after the funeral, the Vatican official said.</p>
        <p>The names of a half-dozen or so bishops have been whispered throughout the cardinal's illness as possible candidates to succeed him. Most often mentioned yesterday was Bishop Edward M. Egan of Bridgeport, Conn., followed by Edwin O'Brien, leader of the military archdiocese.</p>
        <p>Two archbishops who were mentioned as candidates -- Justin F. Rigali of St. Louis and Theodore McCarrick of Newark -- said publicly yesterday that they had been told by the Vatican that they had not been chosen by the pope.</p>
        <p>Whoever is named, the next archbishop will take the stage in the media capital of the world, before New Yorkers trained in Cardinal O'Connor's readiness to jump into the city's rough-and-tumble political scene to speak on explosive social issues. But he will contend with the cardinal's legacy, and with the broader changes among Catholics, in more far-reaching ways as well.</p>
        <p>Irish Catholics, the historic backbone of the Roman Catholic Church in New York, have given way to Hispanics, numerically if not politically, with Asians representing the fastest-growing segment of the New York church. Older parishes dotting the inner cities are becoming ethnic and cultural smorgasbords, while rural parishes in places like Dutchess County are swelling with newcomers and swiftly becoming the new bedroom communities of the New York Archdiocese.</p>
        <p>Against this backdrop, the numbers of priests are growing scarce. Over the last year, considered an average one, more than 30 priests have died in the New York Archdiocese. This month, St. Joseph's seminary in Yonkers will ordain but a half-dozen priests to replace them.</p>
        <p>''The question is, do we start up new parishes?'' asked Msgr. Dominick Lagonegro, the vicar of Dutchess County.</p>
        <p>Monsignor Lagonegro has watched the Catholic population in the rural county boom, leading to the creation of new churches. ''Will we have priests to man these new parishes?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Writ large, one man's problems may spring from another's achievements. While Cardinal O'Connor struggled against fearsome odds to avoid shutting Catholic schools, church watchers expect that his successor will have no choice but to take action, consolidating some schools and parishes and closing others that are struggling. A number of parishes have been forced to dig into their reserve funds to finance schools operating despite persistent losses.</p>
        <p>Given ''the stress put on parishes and the diocese itself,'' said Msgr. Thomas Gilleece, ''I don't know that we can continue to go the way we've been going much longer.''</p>
        <p>While the priests of the archdiocese hardly need to be convinced of the spiritual rewards of providing a religious education, some say that costs of inaction have been more than financial. Morale in the clergy, they say, has sagged.</p>
        <p>''People think nobody cares,'' said one New York pastor. ''There's this sense of an ennui,'' he said, adding, ''Apathy is frozen violence.''</p>
        <p>Archbishop O'Brien, the spiritual leader of Catholics in the armed services, is a native of the Bronx who knows the archdiocese well. He served as its director of communications in the 1980's and was once its vice chancellor. He has also been rector of seminaries in Rome and New York.</p>
        <p>His background in the military echoes that of Cardinal O'Connor,  and some imagine that Archbishop O'Brien, who is 60, would bring similar qualities to the job.</p>
        <p>Though Bishop Egan has tackled some problems resembling New York's, their scale has been far smaller.</p>
        <p>The New York archdiocese, with annual spending of more than $527 million, encompasses 413 parishes, 238 elementary schools and 55 high schools, along with 17 hospitals, 11 mental health residences and 13 day care centers. Real estate holdings throughout the 4,700-square-mile archdiocese, if sold, would bring more than $1 billion.</p>
        <p>More than 870 priests, 3,700 nuns and 1,000 nonclerical employees keep the Roman Catholic Church's vast array of institutions and services functioning while tending to the spiritual needs of their followers.</p>
        <p>In Bridgeport, Bishop Egan has gained attention for his ability to produce homegrown Catholic priests, with some 26 priests ordained in his diocese over the last five years, despite the absence of a major seminary to train them. His success in bringing young men into the priesthood, per capita, has ranked among the best in the northeast, outpacing both the New York and Boston archdioceses.</p>
        <p>Before taking over the Bridgeport diocese in 1988, he was Cardinal O'Connor's auxiliary bishop for education. In Bridgeport, he reorganized the schools system, much as the cardinal did in New York, so that the financing of schools was shared in common by the entire diocese, and poorer parishes no longer had to carry the cost of their neighborhood schools alone. He also closed schools that were dilapidated or poorly attended, thereby strengthening the 38 that remained open, according to local Catholic leaders who observed the process.</p>
        <p>Perhaps equally important, at 68, Bishop Egan would presumably have time to reorganize the church in New  York, while the Vatican could simultaneously groom a Hispanic leader to succeed him.</p>
        <p>With one exception, archbishops of New York have always been Irish, but Hispanics now make up 36 percent of the archdiocese. In keeping with church tradition, Bishop Egan would be required to offer the pope his resignation when he turns 75, in seven years.</p>
        <p>''New York is a big challenge for anybody who gets the job,'' said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a Jesuit who is editor in chief of America, the Catholic magazine.</p>
        <p>Father Reese noted that New York's archbishop must tend not only to Catholics, but also to relations with the myriad ethnic, religious and cultural groups that make up the city. ''And it's New York,'' he added. ''Everybody's going to have an opinion and be second-guessing him.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most important requirement for the new man?</p>
        <p>''He's got to have a thick skin,'' Father Reese said.</p>
