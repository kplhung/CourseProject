        <p>''Prism,'' the amazing new ballet that Helgi Tomasson has choreographed to Beethoven's First Piano Concerto, set off a thunderous burst of applause as the New York City Ballet closed its annual spring gala on Wednesday night at the New York State Theater.</p>
        <p>To say the evening was a triumph would be an understatement. The energy had built steadily both onstage and in the house. In ''Slonimsky's Earbox'' and ''Todo Buenos Aires,'' two premieres named after scores by the post-minimalist composer John Adams, Peter Martins's choreography set off sparks. These were ballets with a novel contemporary thrust.</p>
        <p>Christopher Wheeldon's cheerfully clever Shostakovich ballet, ''Mercurial Manoeuvres,'' first seen last weekend, started the evening's high note of imagination and musical distinction. All the works are part of the Diamond Project, a showcase for new choreography that Mr. Martins, City Ballet's artistic director, initiated in 1992.</p>
        <p>Like all experimental ventures, the previous projects (1992, 1994 and 1997) have produced works of varying quality, although some have been taken into other ballet companies in the United States and abroad. In a curtain speech, Mr. Martins dedicated the evening to Irene Diamond, the project's major donor since its inception, who stood up in the first balcony after the orchestra saluted her with an exuberant drum roll.</p>
        <p>A gala benefit devoted exclusively to new work is a risk for the company. Nor is it common for a black-tie audience to sit for more than two-and-a-half hours when dinner and dancing beckon on the promenade. Most money-raising benefits have grown increasingly short, but this one offered a challenge in its musical seriousness, length and stylistic emphasis.</p>
        <p>For here again, Mr. Martins showed that the City Ballet is not a company like any other. It is not for those who feel most at home with narrative or a traditional view of ballet music and classical technique.</p>
        <p>Beethoven, for instance, is not unknown to other choreographers, but to meet him on a self-confident ground of refinement as Mr. Tomasson has is striking. A ballet company that rarely uses ballet scores is not your everyday dance company. At City Ballet, music for the concert hall is the norm.</p>
        <p>''Prism'' is a homecoming for Mr. Tomasson, who was one of City Ballet's stars before he became artistic director of the San Francisco Ballet in 1985. Born in Iceland, he had Danish ballet teachers and, like Mr. Martins, was one of the world's greatest classical dancers.</p>
        <p>The purity of classical style that came down through the Danish school has been reflected both in Mr. Tomasson's dancing and in his choreography. That he chose an early Beethoven concerto, which is considered strictly classical and which has formalist elements, is not surprising for a neo-classical choreographer with his standards. But emotion is never far from the surface of Mr. Tomasson's work, and in this plotless and formal ballet there is an unmistakable warmth.</p>
        <p>Because of various injuries to dancers, all the ballets on the program had substitutions. In ''Prism,'' the third movement's big solo was danced to electrifying effect by Benjamin Millepied, replacing Sebastien Marcovici.</p>
        <p>The entire ballet is, in the most basic terms, a workout for dancers and musicians. Cameron Grant, the piano soloist, was at his best, and Hugo Fiorato, the conductor, brought out a vibrancy in the orchestra that was superb.</p>
        <p>''Prism,'' like the Beethoven concerto, is long but not dull, studded with the equivalent of the music's famous cadenzas and exuberance. Mr. Tomasson keeps up a swift pace in the first movement, with his dancers mainly in trios. Martin Pakledinaz has costumed the ensemble in yellow and gray with Jenifer Ringer, Jared Angle and Jeroen Hofmans, the soloists, in orange.</p>
        <p>A male trio -- Alexander Ritter, Arch Higgins and Antonio Carmena, a young newcomer with astonishing spring in his scissor leaps -- is often flanked by two female trios. Ms. Ringer, who did double duty by taking over the ballerina role in the Wheeldon ballet (replacing the injured Miranda Weese), is often lifted and partnered separately by her two cavaliers. The piano trills along with her skips as she graciously charms each partner.</p>
        <p>Yet it is male dancing that gets a terrific showcase in this ballet. The male trio has a wonderful and successive series of double air turns. Mr. Hofmans, a Swiss dancer who joined the company in the fall, and Mr. Angle show off a new technical side to their dancing, one rarely seen in George Balanchine's ballets.</p>
        <p>You have to appreciate the classical ballet vocabulary to like ''Prism.'' It is a work rich in so-called old steps in definitely new combinations. The second slow movement is led by the fascinating Maria Kowroski with Charles Askegard as a cavalier who nonetheless makes his presence felt. They are in red, and when the seven couples behind them move in the shadows of Mark Stanley's lighting, the effect is eerie and poetic.</p>
        <p>At times all perform a unison adagio but as the number of pairs diminishes, the focus is clearly on the lifts and eddies of movement of the main couple. When Miss Kowroski ended by arching her body in front of her partner, the audience broke into sudden and prolonged applause.</p>
        <p>As for the exuberant final movement, it was embodied by Mr. Millepied's explosive dancing. Ushering in the finale, he threw himself with abandon into bravura steps in the air. Like the music, the dancers stopped suddenly and marvelously, grouped in a diagonal with some in a deep curtsy. In all, a rich ballet.</p>
        <p>''Slonimsky's Earbox'' is the major Martins premiere, but ''Todo Buenos Aires'' receives such a brilliant performance that it emerges as something more than the light piece it first appears to be. The music is Mr. Adams's reworking of tangos by Astor Piazzolla, and the ballet, danced against dark curved drapes, is a view of tango on toe.</p>
        <p>Albert Evans and Philip Neal fight over the Jezebel-like Wendy Whelan, stunning in her fierce attack on toe or when she flicks her legs back in tango's Milonga style. In the second part, Darci Kistler is all curlicues and good humor, virtually always maneuvered by two sexy sharpies with slicked-back hair: Robert Tewsley (replacing the injured Nilas Martins) and Nikolaj Hubbe are all macho and marvelous as the piano chugs along like a bandoneon, an Argentine accordion, and the tango melody is heard in Guillermo Figueroa's violin solos under Richard Moredock's baton.</p>
        <p>With ''Slonimsky's Earbox,'' Mr. Martins develops a new open style that uses the classical idiom with broader strokes.</p>
        <p>Damian Woetzel, in red leotard, dominates the high-jumping ensemble. There is a lyrical section for Yvonne Borree with Mr. Evans, and Margaret Tracey with Peter Boal. Held apart by the men, the two women join hands.</p>
        <p>There is something very human about this ballet, beginning with Mr. Woetzel's stunning performance and the novelty of the movement images, which include pendulum swings in the partnering. Along with Samantha Allen, Tom Gold and a quartet (Jennifer Tinsley, Robert Lyon, Kathleen Tracey and Kipling Houston), the ensemble shifts into a cascade of changing patterns. The units are small but the impact is big.</p>
