        <p>Vying for the support of union voters, who could be pivotal in deciding New Jersey's Democratic primary for Senate, Jim Florio and Jon S.

        <p>Speaking at the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s annual convention at the Bally's Park Place Casino here, Mr. Florio reminded union members that during his 30 years in elected office he had supported a long list of labor laws, workplace safety measures and strikes.

        <p>Vying for the support of union voters, who could be pivotal in deciding New Jersey's Democratic primary for Senate, Jim Florio and Jon S. Corzine took their increasingly heated rivalry before state labor leaders today, as each candidate portrayed the other as incapable of protecting workers' rights in Congress.</p>
        <p>Speaking at the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s annual convention at the Bally's Park Place Casino here, Mr. Florio reminded union members that during his 30 years in elected office he had supported a long list of labor laws, workplace safety measures and strikes. He cautioned that Mr. Corzine, who has never held elected office, lacked the experience to stand up to Senate Republicans or fend off attempts to roll back protections.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to need on-the-job training,'' Mr. Florio said. ''This is not amateur hour. You've got to have someone who can go down there and from Day 1, stand up for working people.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Corzine told the audience of several hundred union members that his experience as co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company had prepared him to do battle in Washington, and that his calls for an increased minimum wage and universal health insurance would benefit millions of American workers.</p>
        <p>Alluding to the voter revolt that followed the 1990 tax increase Mr. Florio championed as governor, Mr.  Corzine warned Democrats that even if Mr. Florio were to win a primary, he would be unlikely to survive a general election.</p>
        <p>''Politics is about winning,'' Mr. Corzine said. ''Your choice is essentially about electability.''</p>
        <p>A flier distributed by his campaign hammered that point home, warning, ''If Jim Florio wins in June, a Republican wins in November.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Corzine and Mr. Florio spoke separately, it was clear that each was honing themes for the four debates they have scheduled,  beginning next week. Mr. Corzine, who has spent $10 million on the primary, broadcast the campaign's first attack commercial two weeks ago, reminding voters of the $2.8 billion tax increase Mr. Florio pushed through the Legislature.</p>
        <p>But in today's address, Mr. Corzine used the tax increase to question Mr. Florio's viability as a candidate in November, breaking a promise he made earlier in the race to avoid making criticisms that Republicans might seize on in a general election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio's budget is too meager to buy television ads until the week before the June 6 primary. But his campaign has been relentless in criticizing Mr. Corzine for failing to vote in Democratic primaries, giving donations to Republicans and refusing to release his complete tax return.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Florio also made a veiled reference to the ethnically offensive remarks Mr. Corzine made  last year, in which he asked an Italian-American construction worker if he made ''cement shoes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio, who is part Italian, told the workers about his immigrant grandfather Giuseppe and his father, Vincenzo, who worked in a Camden shipyard. ''Both were hard-working. And both were law-abiding,'' he said, to a rousing cheer from the audience.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Florio received a warmer response from the audience, most political observers believe the two candidates have equal support from union members. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. is not endorsing a candidate in the primary. But individual locals have made endorsements and have been evenly split. Most political analysts believe that breakdown is a good sign for Mr. Corzine, because Mr. Florio's campaign has tried to portray Mr. Corzine as a Wall Street robber baron whose corporate mergers cost thousands of workers their jobs.</p>
        <p>''Labor provides money and people going to the polls at the primary, so if it's a wash, I think that's bad for Florio,'' said Clifford Zukin, a pollster and professor at Rutgers University. ''Corzine has advantages in other resources, like money. So it would have been a big help for Florio to have an advantage with the unions.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Florio's advisers say, expect his union supporters to be more energized. ''Jon Corzine has a few friends who have gotten him endorsements from union leaders,''  Jim Lanard, Mr. Florio's spokesman, said. ''But the rank and file, the people here who support Jim Florio, have known him for years. He's been with them, and they're going to be there for him.''</p>
