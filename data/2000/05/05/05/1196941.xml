        <p>It can be argued that the Devils have been better than the Maple Leafs. Despite outplaying Toronto in the first four games, the Devils are deadlocked in their Eastern Conference semifinal series at two games apiece.</p>

        <p>It can be argued that the Devils have been better than the Maple Leafs. Despite outplaying Toronto in the first four games, the Devils are deadlocked in their Eastern Conference semifinal series at two games apiece.</p>
        <p>The Devils have outshot Toronto in all four games -- 33-21 in Game 1, then 33-20, 36-23 and 36-22 -- but the Maple Leafs still managed to snatch two victories, the latest a 3-2 triumph in Game 4 Wednesday night at Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>The Devils were in the driver's seat after winning the first game at home following a split in Toronto. But the advantage now goes to the Maple Leafs, who will play host to Game 5 on Saturday night. Game 6 is scheduled to be played at Continental Arena on Monday and if a seventh game is necessary, it will be played in Toronto Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>The late-season slump that robbed the Devils of the home-ice advantage could now become pivotal. Instead of being one of the top three teams in the playoffs, the Devils' fourth seeding might now turn out to hurt more than most people imagined during their finishing malaise.</p>
        <p>''I am not concerned about where we play,'' said Ken Daneyko, one of the few Devils who played Wednesday night and appeared today at the team's training facility here -- but did not skate -- for the optional practice. ''We could be playing in Siberia for all I know. If we don't play our game, it doesn't matter where we play.''</p>
        <p>None of the Devils who played Wednesday night laced up their skates today. The four or five who attended stretched and rode the exercise bike, leaving the minor league players -- and Sergei Brylin, who has not played since the second game of the Florida series -- to work with Coach Larry Robinson and his assistants.</p>
        <p>Robinson participated in all the drills with the players from the Albany River Rats, the Devils' top affiliate in the minor leagues. The Devils coach looked exhausted when he stepped off the ice.</p>
        <p>''This is harder than a 12-mile run,'' Robinson said before he got down to the serious business of analyzing the last game and previewing the rest of the series.</p>
        <p>The first question Robinson dealt with was Curtis Joseph. Toronto's goaltender has been better than Martin Brodeur in the series, although Brodeur is still the leading goaltender in the playoffs with a 1.51 goals-against average.</p>
        <p>''It has been our inability to put away loose pucks as much as he saving them,'' Robinson said of Joseph. ''He has been lucky, but you've got to be good to be lucky. He's been stopping shots he can't see.''</p>
        <p>Joseph is good, being one of three goaltenders -- Olaf Kolig of Washington and Roman Turek of St. Louis are the others -- who has been nominated by the league for the Vezina Trophy that goes to the league's best goaltender.</p>
        <p>Robinson also said he was concerned with the way the Devils have started games, except for one game, and said it was something he would have to address with his players again.</p>
        <p>Asked whether his players should feel loose or be on the edge for Saturday's game in Toronto, Robinson said, ''I don't want either. You have to go in with a certain amount of fear about not playing well and letting your teammates down.''</p>
        <p>Daneyko, the only player who talked with reporters after today's practice, said he was not surprised that the series was tied, even though the Devils had the edge in the first four games.</p>
        <p>''You can dominate a game and lose,'' Daneyko said. ''And if you get the goaltending, it means you have the upper hand.'' He was referring to Joseph, who is known as Cujo.</p>
        <p>Daneyko said that Robinson was extremely disappointed at the failure of the majority of his players to ''do the little things right'' in Wednesday night's loss.</p>
        <p>''He wants to make sure that all of us do our thing to win the series,'' Daneyko said. ''He wants to get a point across that we have to do the little things right. You can't afford to have passengers. We didn't have a great effort from everyone. It can be three or four guys, but that's enough to lose a game.''</p>
        <p>After four games in the series, Joseph and the opportunistic Leafs have proved they can win despite the Devils' better numbers. The Devils have won at least 9 of the 12 periods played -- and the series is still deadlocked. Not only did the Devils outshoot Toronto in all four games, they also won twice as many face-offs,45-23, in Game 4. And the Maple Leafs also proved they can beat the Devils even if their top line is kept under wraps.</p>
