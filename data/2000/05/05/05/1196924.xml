        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You outline the severance package, worth more than $37 million, that Jill E. Barad got from Mattel (Business Day, May 1) when she resigned as chief executive after putting Mattel on the financial brink. One can only wonder what her package would have been had she had a successful run as chief executive.</p>
        <p>When a chief executive blunders, why must the employees and shareholders be the only ones who are hurt?</p>
