        <p>Monday was Decision Day for many high school seniors choosing colleges, but it came and went without so much as a peep from the Bush campaign about the destinations of Gov. George W. Bush's twin 18-year-old daughters, Barbara and Jenna.</p>
        <p>How far from home would they be straying? The Texas governor's aides were silent. What factors had the girls' final selection hinged on? Mum was the word. Aides acknowledged that the information would probably trickle out soon enough, through an unguarded utterance by Mr. Bush or an offhand comment by an official at one of the schools. But for just a bit longer, the family wanted to try to preserve the girls' privacy.</p>
        <p>The Bush family has been remarkably successful at that, so much so that while Mr. Bush could become the next president and while his extended family is beginning to look an awful lot like a political dynasty, his two daughters are almost invisible, their faces unknown to 99.9 percent of voters outside Texas and their public sightings only slightly more frequent than Bigfoot's.</p>
        <p>They have appeared only a few times on the campaign trail, and they have not shown up in their father's commercials.</p>
        <p>''From the time he was elected governor, we've had a policy that the girls are not interviewed and not photographed,'' said Karen P. Hughes, the communications director for the Bush campaign and a senior adviser to Mr. Bush since 1994.</p>
        <p>Far from being out of the ordinary, the daughters' anonymity immediately recalls that of Chelsea Clinton during her father's first presidential campaign, in 1992, and is shared to a degree by the three younger Gore children. (The oldest, Karenna Gore Schiff, 26, has a public role as an adviser to her father's presidential campaign.)</p>
        <p>And it proves that even in an age when politicians will use most facets of their biographies to market themselves and the press shines a spotlight into many corners of a politician's private life, there remains at least one largely unexploited, scrutiny-free zone. The children are spared.</p>
        <p>Although President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, have often been portrayed as indiscriminately ambitious, Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism in Washington, noted that ''for the most part, the Clintons have not used Chelsea as a campaign tool.''</p>
        <p>In turn, Mr. Rosenstiel said, ''for all of the controversy and invasiveness of the press coverage concerning Bill Clinton, with a handful of exceptions, the press has respected the Clintons' wish to leave Chelsea alone.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has similarly benefited from news organizations' voluntary restraint. Austin is not so big a place, and there are reporters whose children -- or whose friends' children -- attend the same public high school from which Barbara and Jenna Bush will be graduating this month. But the fruits of that familiarity have not found their way onto television or into newspapers.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mr. Bush trusts reporters on his campaign plane to be cognizant of, and to respect, his wishes that his daughters remain journalistically off-limits, and he thus talks somewhat freely about them on occasion and even mentioned, several times, the kinds of colleges each daughter was considering.</p>
        <p>Barbara, named for her paternal grandmother, actually hopped aboard the campaign plane on Saturday and used it as her transportation from Austin to New York City to take a last look at one of the colleges near the top of her list. But she kept a careful distance from reporters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenstiel and several political press secretaries said there seemed to be an unspoken covenant between politicians and journalists: if a politician does not press his or her children into sustained service as political props, journalists have little rationale for examining in detail the children's lives, at least when the children are still school-age.</p>
        <p>Political analysts noted that while most candidates and elected officials undoubtedly keep their children offstage to protect them, there may be political benefit as well, in that voters are likely to take note of, and admire, that course of action.</p>
        <p>The personal-biography section of Mr. Bush's Web site digresses to mention, ''Governor and Mrs. Bush have worked hard to protect their daughters' privacy. They attend public school in Austin but do not give interviews and only appear at public events if they want to.''</p>
        <p>In public, Mr. Bush walks a carefully but not always consistently drawn line. He sporadically delights audiences with a fleeting, vague riff on the agonies and ecstasies of fatherhood and repeatedly mentions that Barbara and Jenna go to a public high school. But he generally furnishes no more specifics about them than about the family's six-toed cat, Ernie.</p>
        <p>There are exceptions to this reticence, the most conspicuous one being a chapter of his autobiography, ''A Charge to Keep'' (William Morrow &amp; Company, 1999), in which Mr. Bush discusses his support for the death penalty. He divulges that one daughter -- he does not say which -- told him over the dinner table that she disagrees with him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, have said repeatedly that they want Barbara and Jenna, fraternal twins who are the couple's only children, to be affected by their father's political celebrity as little as possible.</p>
        <p>From what little has been published or broadcast in Texas about the girls, they have managed to maintain relatively normal lives.</p>
        <p>When the family first moved to Austin, the girls attended the St. Andrews Episcopal School here, but they transferred to Austin High School in the ninth grade.</p>
        <p>And they behaved as teenagers typically do, bowing to the latest pop-cultural fashions and sometimes remarking on how unfashionable their father was. In interviews with Texas journalists in the past, Mrs. Bush bemoaned that the girls's television-watching habits, at least a few years ago, included ''Beverly Hills 90210'' and ''Melrose Place,'' and noted that they would sometimes stop their father before he walked out the door, questioning his choice of attire.</p>
        <p>Even as a governor's children, they were not constantly escorted or monitored by guards, but security around the entire family tightened earlier this year with the arrival of the Secret Service, much to the girls chagrin, an aide to Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>''Their friends can no longer pull in the back driveway of the governor's mansion or just drop in and out,'' the aide said. ''That's no fun for teenage girls, and that's been a big change for them.</p>
        <p>According to the aide and several of Mr. Bush's friends, the girls' low public profile reflects their own desires as much as their parents' efforts. For example, Barbara and Jenna Bush briefly considered accompanying their parents to the polls in Texas for the Republican primary; it was, after all, the first election cycle in which the girls were old enough to vote.</p>
        <p>But when they found out that photographers would be chronicling their father's movements, they decided not to go. Similarly, Barbara and Jenna appeared on stage with their father only twice in the primaries: once in New Hampshire, on the night that he lost to Senator John McCain of Arizona, and once in Austin.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Bush's advisers said Barbara and Jenna Bush had learned early on that even the most seemingly harmless exposure could yield accidental humiliation.</p>
        <p>About six years ago, when a television crew shot footage of the Bushes decorating their Christmas tree, the telephone rang and Mr. Bush joked that it might be a boy who liked Jenna. When the story was broadcast, it included both that comment and Jenna's mortified reaction.</p>
