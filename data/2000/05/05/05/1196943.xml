        <p>In his personal moments, Niall FitzGerald, head of Unilever, the world's leading producer of consumer goods, is a collector of art. In business, he has become a collector of brands to augment a staggering range from Ragu spaghetti sauce to Lipton tea. Right now, he is hoping life will not imitate art.</p>
        <p>During a visit to Hanoi two years ago, Mr. FitzGerald said, a Vietnamese artist refused to sell him what he wanted: a collection of sketches from the Vietnam War. Instead, the artist sold the executive a richly colored painting of park land.</p>
        <p>This week, Mr. FitzGerald and Anthony Burgmans, his co-chairman at Unilever, offered $18.4 billion for Bestfoods of Englewood Cliffs., N.J., which owns top-selling brands like Knorr soups, Hellman's mayonnaise and Skippy peanut butter. Like the Vietnamese artist, Bestfoods said no. But Mr. FitzGerald hopes that a no can turn to yes.</p>
        <p>''I think Bestfoods will be bought,'' he said today in the chairman's lounge -- where the Vietnamese painting now hangs -- at Unilever's Art Deco London headquarters.</p>
        <p>Even if successful, the bid will raise some eyebrows not just because of its size but because just a few weeks ago, Unilever said it was planning to winnow -- not expand -- its brands.</p>
        <p>Mr. FitzGerald insisted that the moves to shrink the brand range while acquiring new ones were part of the same strategy: ''We wanted to focus our resources behind leading brands. These are brands that are powerful -- in the first or second position. If you focus your resources behind these, they grow even quicker.''</p>
        <p>On Feb. 22, the company announced a $5 billion program to eliminate 25,000 jobs -- 10 percent of its global work force -- close 100 factories and focus spending on the top 400 brands, leaving 1,200 to fade away or be sold. This was to create annual savings of $1.5 billion by 2004 and to increase annual sales growth and profit margins.</p>
        <p>Only weeks after this seeming contradiction, Unilever embarked on a shopping spree that has culminated in the Bestfoods offer. Last month, in rapid-fire forays into the United States, Unilever bought Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade for $326 million and, the same day, announced the $2.6 billion acquisition of Slim-Fast Foods.</p>
        <p>Buying Bestfoods, Mr. FitzGerald said, would fit clearly into this strategy because of the power of brands that include Mazola corn oil and Skippy. Knorr, for instance, with annual sales of some $2 billion, ''would be our biggest food brand.''</p>
        <p>''In two or three years time, this business will be in a relatively small number of very high growth categories, strong in both the developed and developing worlds,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To support the unsolicited bid, Unilever has arranged a $20 billion credit that has raised speculation the Anglo-Dutch company plans to either go hostile or sweeten its bid.</p>
        <p>Initially at least, Mr. FitzGerald is making his pitch to Bestfoods shareholders, offering a price representing a 50 percent premium over Bestfoods' share price six weeks ago.</p>
        <p>He said that the company had lifted a deadline for a response from Bestfoods by this afternoon. ''We would hope that in the next few days the shareholders of Bestfoods, will express their views to the management,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. FitzGerald, 54, is playing the highest stakes of his lifelong career at Unilever, whose Irish subsidiary he joined as an accountant in 1967 after graduating from University College, Dublin, with a degree in commerce. The Bestfoods acquisition would be Unilever's biggest and it comes midway through one of the most extensive corporate shifts the company has undertaken.</p>
        <p>Since shedding its specialty chemicals divisions in 1997, said Charlie Mills, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, ''Unilever has been going for a radical change in the rather sleepy Anglo-Dutch colonial attitude that it was once run with.''</p>
        <p>Mr. FitzGerald has been chairman of the British-listed branch of the company since September 1996, overseeing an attempt to transform a company that, he acknowledged, was once viewed as being slower to change course than a supertanker.  Like other consumer goods makers, the company has watched investors' money flee to the dazzling prospects of technology stocks. In the year through February, Unilever's stock fell by 35 percent as the consumer goods industry in general felt the pain of losing investors drawn to quicker profits elsewhere. The 1999 sales of $44 billion were flat.</p>
        <p>Over a longer period, the poor share price has mirrored a lackluster performance in Unilever's foods business, particularly in emerging markets. A deal with Bestfoods, said David Lang, an analyst with Investec Henderson Crosthwaite, ''brings products that are ideally suited to developing the emerging markets.''</p>
        <p>A deal with Bestfoods would be ''bang in line with their strategy,'' he said. With 60 percent of Bestfoods' sales outside the United States, another analyst said, ''it is a very good geographic fit.''</p>
        <p>Mr. FitzGerald clearly shares that view and, he said, he was surprised by the market reaction to his offer -- Unilever stock slid 10 per cent yesterday, but gained 1.3 percent today. ''There was a worry that we were getting into a hostile bid and it was the start of a bidding war and we would end up paying a ridiculous price,'' he said. ''That's not going to happen.''</p>
        <p>Mr. FitzGerald bridled slightly at the suggestion that Unilever was trying to buy growth in areas where the company's own strategies had failed to deliver. ''We continue to be very confident that we will deliver by 2004'' -- the target of February's strategic announcement.</p>
        <p>But he acknowledged that an acquisition of Bestfoods had provoked debate within Unilever. ''We have been considering this for the better part of six months,'' he said. ''We talked it through with great care. Can we do all this at the same time?'' The answer, he said, was that Bestfoods would bring ''both strong brands and strong management.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, some analysts worry that the deal -- if successful -- will be complex, with many regulatory and other issues. ''There are big cultural issues,'' said Mr. Lang of Investec Henderson Crosthwaite. ''They can't afford to mishandle the integration of the companies.''</p>
