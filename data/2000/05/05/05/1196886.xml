        <p>In the spring, our thoughts turn to the outdoors, and a good way to celebrate the season is to dine al fresco. Here are 12 restaurants that offer pleasant garden spots.

        <p>Al Fresco</p>
        <p>In the spring, our thoughts turn to the outdoors, and a good way to celebrate the season is to dine al fresco. Here are 12 restaurants that offer pleasant garden spots. (These summaries are taken from dining reviews, columns and articles in The Times by William Grimes, Eric Asimov and others.)</p>
        <p>1. Aesop's Tables</p>
        <p>*  [Rating: 1 star]</p>
        <p>(718) 720-2005</p>
        <p>1233 Bay Street</p>
        <p>Rosebank, Staten Island</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>In the bountiful garden at Aesop's Tables, far from the bright lights of Manhattan, you can see the stars. That's only one of the charms of this warm little country restaurant, with such contemporary American appetizers as pulled duck quesadilla with roasted vegetables and Monterey Jack cheese; pan-roasted baby clams with broccoli rabe, Black Forest ham, slow oven-cooked tomatoes and shellfish broth. Main courses include grilled lamb sirloin, marinated in basil and served with a Tuscan white bean cake, eggplant vegetable ragout and lamb jus; and tomato-and-olive-poached catfish fillet with herbed chickpeas and sauteed spinach.</p>
        <p>2. Barbetta</p>
        <p>++</p>
        <p>(212) 246-9171</p>
        <p>321 West 46th Street</p>
        <p>Clinton</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The oldest restaurant garden in New York City is at Barbetta, which has been owned by the Maloglio family for 94 years. The tall trees, the cool, almost musical fountain and the stone floor seem an Old World escape from the bustle of Midtown, while the dining room resembles an Italian villa. The best dishes are the Piedmontese specialties: a wonderful minestrone served at room temperature and thin strands of a pasta called tajarin in a simple tomato sauce. The menu also includes paillard of rack of venison with seasonal greens and fruits; broiled Atlantic salmon with herbed hollandaise sauce; and Maine diver scallops capped with a julienne Yukon potato crust.</p>
        <p>3. B Bar</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 475-2220</p>
        <p>40 East Fourth Street</p>
        <p>East Village</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Going to B Bar for the food is kind of like going to Casablanca for the waters. You were probably misinformed. But the restaurant, formerly known as Bowery Bar, still draws a young, great-looking crowd and the occasional celebrity. When ordering, think simple, along the lines of hamburgers, french fries, salads and pastas. The restaurant occupies what was once a garage; where the gas pumps stood is now a large walled garden. But don't dig down. You're not likely to strike oil.</p>

        <p>(212) 517-1200</p>
        <p>53 East 77th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The interior design of this tiny French seafood restaurant is quiet and neutral, seemingly intended to keep the focus on the lush creations of Laurent Tourondel, the executive chef. As the chef at C.T. a few years ago, Mr. Tourondel specialized in flamboyant, offbeat dishes, but now he simply lets the flavors do the talking. Rectangles of marinated ahi tuna, lovely in their precision, are wrapped in a translucent sheet of daikon radish and finished off with a caramelized-lemon accent, while tomato gelee brings out the natural sweetness of a compressed cake of peekytoe crab meat. Mr. Tourondel's refined main courses include potato-crusted halibut with chive nage, asparagus and baby artichokes; rich Atlantic turbot that comes with a slice of sage-wrapped foie gras. Desserts are top-notch, and the wine list is well chosen. The quarters feel a little less tight since the restaurant opened a small garden space with attractive umbrellas and an Arman sculpture of a dozen bronze cellos in a chaotic vertical assemblage.</p>
        <p>5. Grove</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 675-9463</p>
        <p>314 Bleecker Street, at Grove Street</p>
        <p>West Village</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Grove's largely American menu doesn't carve out any new territory, but what it lacks in trendiness it gives back in good food, not to mention a large, lovely garden surrounded by flowers. Among the best appetizers are excellent steamed mussels, duck confit with black lentils and frisee, and beet salad with toasted walnuts. Main courses like hanger steak, a thick and meaty pork chop and roast chicken are generous, and desserts can be terrific.</p>
        <p>6. Le Jardin Bistro</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 343-9599</p>
        <p>25 Cleveland Place, between Spring and Kenmare Streets</p>
        <p>Little Italy</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Most people who have been to France can remember little restaurants there where the simple food was so good that they can still conjure up the flavors. Le Jardin is a restaurant that lives up to those memories. Its traditional dishes -- steaks frites, moules frites, cassoulet, bouillabaisse -- are all outstanding, and the chef and owner, Gerard Maurice, produces some exceptional additional dishes, like buttery tuna tartare and a lusty sweetbread salad. The charming garden in the rear looks as if it has been there forever, and Mr. Maurice says he produces a few bottles of wine annually from the grapevines.</p>
        <p>7. Lhasa</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 674-5870</p>
        <p>96 Second Avenue, near Fifth Street</p>
        <p>East Village</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>This Tibetan restaurant is a mellow, quiet place with tranquil music playing softly in the background and a staff that is friendly, calm, alert and responsive. The handsome paneled dining room is often empty; everybody's out on the patio with its serene rock garden. With its Chinese and Indian influences, you'd expect Tibetan food to be spicy, but in fact it's mild. You may find yourself reaching for the hot sauce on the table to give the food a jolt. Some of the better dishes include shrimp patties, firm disks filled with chopped shrimp, which are delicious with their minty dipping sauce; wonderfully savory fried momo, or dumplings, stuffed with chicken; tsel gyathuk ngopa, or egg noodles sauteed until almost crisp and topped with spinach, carrots and bok choy; and then thuk, a hearty bowl of flat noodles with just the right amount of resistance in a broth with tasty bites of beef, radish, spinach and a dollop of cottage cheese. For an unusual dessert try bhaktsa makhu, firm little cylinders of pasta rolled in brown sugar and topped with grated cheese. They are tastier than they sound.</p>
        <p>8. Roettele A.G.</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 674-4140</p>
        <p>126 East Seventh Street, near Avenue A</p>
        <p>East Village</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Why has this unpretentious Swiss restaurant quietly survived in the tumultuous East Village while all around it noisier, flashier restaurants have opened and closed? Partly because the food is always well prepared, with top choices like viande des Grisons, thin slices of spicy air-dried beef with a garnish of cornichons, and smoked trout fillet with lingonberry and horseradish cream sauce. Also it's such a pleasant place to have a meal, especially when the garden is open. Desserts are particularly good, including chocolate fondue, a moist, delicious linzer torte and apple strudel.</p>
        <p>9. Sugar Bar</p>
        <p>++</p>
        <p>(212) 579-0222</p>
        <p>254 West 72nd Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Sugar Bar is owned by Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson, the husband-and-wife singing team, but it is no celebrity vanity restaurant. The quasi-Caribbean menu includes dishes like cinnamon-rubbed loin of pork with candied squash and corn cakes; African spiced shrimp with tabbouleh; and black sesame crusted tuna with wheat berry, guava and lime glaze. The lovely little garden, with only seven tables, is the only one of its kind on the Upper West Side. Added benefit: great restrooms. But beware, service can be very slow.</p>
        <p>10. I Trulli</p>
        <p>**  [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 481-7372</p>
        <p>122 East 27th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The garden at I Trulli is a Mediterranean dream, a gracious shaded patio with terra cotta tiles and walls daubed with abstract landscapes in soothing colors. But the food doesn't fit the Mediterranean stereotype. I Trulli specializes in the rustic, forceful food of Apulia, the region of Italy's heel. While the restaurant does not have as many unfamiliar dishes as it once did, it is still possible to dine on such unusual fare as grilled baby octopus, cuttlefish and calamari served with sauteed wheat berries and seasonal vegetables, and cavatelli tossed with broccoli rabe and toasted almonds, while sipping wines selected from a wonderful, well-priced list.</p>
        <p>11. Va Tutto!</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 941-0286</p>
        <p>23 Cleveland Place, between Spring and Kenmare Streets</p>
        <p>Little Italy</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Daydreaming comes easily at this warm and welcoming Tuscan-oriented restaurant where a lovely garden looms invitingly though the open doors at the rear of the dining room. The chef, Maria Giordano Lupo, who once cooked at Gotham Bar and Grill, has put together an easy-to-enjoy menu that suggests Tuscany but isn't overly zealous about it. Grilled calamari, barely crisp around the edges and served with moist polenta spiked with Gorgonzola and greens is an excellent presentation, and pastas al forno, baked dishes like a thin wedge of lasagna with fennel sausage, roasted peppers and plum tomatoes; and cannelloni stuffed with spinach, mushrooms and Parmesan are sumptuous. The wine list is modest but offers some good bottles from the northern Italian regions. For dessert Va Tutto! offers the rare panna cotta in which flavor triumphs over texture.</p>
        <p>12. Verbena</p>
        <p>**  [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 260-5454</p>
        <p>54 Irving Place, at 17th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>In the garden behind Verbena the vines share space with diners. Yet with buildings pressing in on all sides, the garden is distinctly urban, and there is nothing rustic about the food. Diane Forley, the chef and owner, favors exotic combinations like ravioli filled with butternut squash and flavored with roasted oranges and sage. The current menu includes marinated seafood salad with tomatillo, cucumbers and ramps; and roast chicken quinoa pilaf with red lentils and zaatar broth. It would be a shame to miss desserts like a rum-soaked savarin, a huge yeasty doughnut filled with chocolate souffle, or the creme brulee, infused with verbena, of course.</p>
