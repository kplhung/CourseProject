        <p>Eric Bogosian's midlife crisis, which opened for public view last night at the Jane Street Theater under the title ''Wake Up and Smell the Coffee,'' throws an interesting new light on the menagerie of self-justifying, angry-if-terrified men who have always populated his life-in-America one-man shows. He's one of them.</p>
        <p>''I'm so smart,'' he says near the end of this shrewd and bristly performance piece, his manner overcaffeinated, his large hands working in front of him imploringly. ''In my black jeans and my righteous anger, going on and on about hypocrisy, irritating people'' -- actually he uses a more vulgar idiom -- ''just enough to sell a few tickets. Always looking over my shoulder, making sure I don't lose my place in the big line. Desperately trying to preserve my modicum of success so that I can hold my head high in this giant pecking order of art and commerce and celebrity . . . I toe the line. And I do it for a very good reason. I'm a sheep. I'm a gutless sheep.''</p>

        <p>Eric Bogosian's midlife crisis, which opened for public view last night at the Jane Street Theater under the title ''Wake Up and Smell the Coffee,'' throws an interesting new light on the menagerie of self-justifying, angry-if-terrified men who have always populated his life-in-America one-man shows. He's one of them.</p>
        <p>''I'm so smart,'' he says near the end of this shrewd and bristly performance piece, his manner overcaffeinated, his large hands working in front of him imploringly. ''In my black jeans and my righteous anger, going on and on about hypocrisy, irritating people'' -- actually he uses a more vulgar idiom -- ''just enough to sell a few tickets. Always looking over my shoulder, making sure I don't lose my place in the big line. Desperately trying to preserve my modicum of success so that I can hold my head high in this giant pecking order of art and commerce and celebrity . . . I toe the line. And I do it for a very good reason. I'm a sheep. I'm a gutless sheep.''</p>
        <p>Infused with the same hyperbole that Mr. Bogosian brings to the other characters he presents here -- the Deepak Chopra-like guru for whom ''money brings deep and abiding harmony,'' or the airline ticket attendant who reassures an infuriatingly delayed passenger, ''You can win, sir, you can; you just can't win today'' -- the confession is nervy and funny. But it is also a little melancholy. Eventually, even the raging rebel runs out of steam, goes along to get along.</p>
        <p>Don't be misled. Mr. Bogosian has not gone gentle. But turning his virulent satire upon himself has the effect of a kind of compassion for the businessmen, drug dealers, evangelists, street people, suburbanites and others that he has skewered so memorably over the years for their presumptive preoccupation with various forms of ego gratification. What else can you expect from people living in a culture that equates celebrity with just deserts? We're all susceptible.</p>
        <p>''See, there's another world and it's just like ours, but it's much better,'' he says, with faux yearning. ''It floats above us . . . Can you see them up there? Can you see the gods? Look at them; aren't they beautiful? They're playing volleyball. There's Gwyneth passing off to Oprah. . . . My life is good, but the gods' life is better. Better parties, better clothes, better cars, better sex, better breath. And see, I'm going to get there, because I'm paying my dues.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bogosian, who is the author of three full-length plays (''Talk Radio,'' ''Suburbia'' and ''Griller'') in addition to five previous one-man shows, has constructed this piece as a whole narrative. It meanders at times as characters digress and morph into other characters, but it is sneakily held together by the idea that performers of every stripe -- the person on the stage, in front of a camera, holding a microphone -- have become objects of worship and sources of wisdom.</p>
        <p>Entering as a shrieking pro wrestler (''So if you don't like pain don't even get in the ring with me''), he quickly dons a New Age persona and becomes a touchy-feely version of himself, then switches to Regis Philbin's evil twin for a surreal rendition of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''</p>
        <p>He assumes the role of a plaintive audience member who laments such abrasive role-playing (''You don't believe in anything; you need to have more faith.'') at which point, as himself, he rants about a God who tortured his only son and a government that countenances the shooting of unarmed citizens by the police. Faith in what? It's the wisdom of idiots we revere: ''Forrest Gump,'' ''Sling Blade,'' ''Rain Man.''</p>
        <p>''We're looking up at the mentally handicapped. Where does that put us?''</p>
        <p>So it furiously goes, mockery and exhortation, scorn and pity. Not every line registers as intended; the border between effective satire and bluster is a porous one. And there is an imagined conversation between God and Jesus on the cross that feels like an interruption: time out for a comedy club routine, and not a terribly good one at that.</p>
        <p>But even when Mr. Bogosian's writing flags, he remains irresistibly watchable. With his dark features and pale eyes, his importuning expressions, he looks like Jerry Seinfeld's less-smiled-upon brother. He behaves that way, too -- resentful of his passive-aggressive fortunate sibling. And after all, Mr. Seinfeld deserves it.</p>
        <p>Then, too, Mr. Bogosian saves his most resonant material for the second half of the show. It is then that he acknowledges, slowly, artfully, his complicity in the cultural wasteland he abhors. In a winding string of interconnected bits, he goes from a parody of an obsequious actor auditioning to a sex fantasy about a stewardess on a cross-country flight, which is interrupted by another fantasy about the plane going down in the Rockies -- air travel comes in for a lot of abuse in this show -- and the welcome he receives afterward in Hollywood, which is hungry to make the story of his miraculous survival into an uplifting movie epic. His version of a studio executive taps a new vein in a much-parodied stereotype.</p>
        <p>And thus, dreaming these dreams, does he conclude that he is no longer who he was. In a reprise of one of his most vivid caricatures, a drug-dealer named Red from the show ''Pounding Nails Into the Floor With My Forehead,'' he recreates a filthily hilarious pantomime of a cocaine-  and alcohol-fueled sex act. And then, rueful or relieved, he pauses. It's a complicated moment, for man and artist both.</p>
        <p>''I can talk the talk,'' he says, nostalgic. ''But I can't walk the walk.''</p>
        <p>WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE</p>
