        <p>EARLY eight months ago, Hurricane Floyd stormed up the East Coast, flooding more than 37,000 vehicles in 16 states and generating $70.3 million in auto insurance claims, according to Insurance Services Office Inc. of New York, which keeps track of losses for insurers.</p>
        <p>Where did all those water-logged vehicles end up? That question should interest anyone now shopping for a used car. Many of these ''floaters'' were cleaned out and put up for sale, just as consumer-protection agencies and news organizations had warned even before the waters receded.</p>
        <p>But the alerts may have come too early. This spring, traditionally the busy season at used-car lots, could bring the first significant sightings of September's flotsam. There is typically a lag of several months between a serious flood and the appearance of water-damaged vehicles on the market, said Cari Hepp, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Mike Easley of North Carolina, the state hit hardest by Floyd.</p>
        <p>Her office recently resolved six complaints from consumers who said they had unwittingly bought flooded cars in North Carolina, and the timing of the damage pointed to Floyd. All those cases were settled with restitution to buyers. Other complaints are coming in from inside and outside the state, and many more are expected.</p>
        <p>''We're just at the beginning,'' Ms. Hepp said, noting that some cars stayed under water more than a week after the storm. Then claims were settled and new titles were obtained that branded the vehicles as flood-damaged, as state law requires.</p>
        <p>The flooded cars drew automobile wholesalers to the state. Some were sent to South America or elsewhere in the world, and many were shipped to other states, where they were cleaned and reconditioned, then marketed to dealers. ''A vehicle may have changed hands two or three times, and new titles had to be applied for,'' Ms. Hepp said, ''So you can see why it took so long.''</p>
        <p>In February, her office assembled a list of more than 8,000 vehicles that had been issued water-damaged titles in the four months after Floyd. This database, with years, makes, models and vehicle identification numbers was posted on a North Carolina Web site (www.jus.state.nc.us) and distributed nationally. It has prompted a stream of calls, Ms. Hepp said.</p>
        <p>Other states affected by Floyd, which was downgraded to a tropical storm by the time it hit the Northeast, have created their own databases of flood-damaged vehicles. A New Jersey Web site (www.state.nj.us/lps/ ca/ocp/floveh.htm) includes lists of vehicles provided by Ford, Honda, BMW and major auto-salvage companies. Consumers can also use a car's vehicle identification number, called the VIN, to obtain a title history from Carfax (wsf.carfax.com) for $14.95, or $19.95 for an unlimited number of reports over two months. Such a history can reveal whether a title has been ''washed'' -- a process in which labels like ''flood car'' or ''salvage'' are excised through reregistration in different states, since states define such conditions differently.</p>
        <p>But other circumstances can keep flooded cars off any list. In four of the six cases settled in North Carolina, no database would have helped. Two of the cars had been traded in to dealers who sold them to consumers, Ms. Hepp said; it is unclear whether any insurance claims had been made on them, but they had not been declared totaled. Two other vehicles had been flooded on the lot of a used-car dealer who lacked insurance.</p>
        <p>Researching the VIN would have protected the two other consumers. In one case, a flood title had been issued, but the buyer had not seen it. The transaction had been financed, so the title had remained with the finance company, which is legal in North Carolina; in some other states, including New York, the buyer would receive the title even if the car was financed.</p>
        <p>Would any consumer knowingly buy a flood-damaged car? Ms. Hepp allowed that this was possible, and executives of Copart Inc., an auto-salvage company based in Benicia, Calif., agreed. ''It's a way to get a 1999 Lexus GS 300 for less than retail value,'' said Cherie Hargrove, general manager of Copart's auction yard in Marlboro, N.Y., just outside Newburgh. On a sunny November morning, a banner gaily lettered ''Hurricane Floyd'' hung over a dealers-only sale where hundreds of vehicles went on the block, including some that had been flooded. All were properly titled, Ms. Hargrove said.</p>
        <p>Dealers assembled for the auction speculated that the flooded cars had come from areas of neighboring Connecticut that Floyd had inundated. Dave Wakefield of Auto Specialists in West Haven, Conn., said he was looking for flood-damaged cars to repair and ''wholesale out.'' Most dealers, though, said they were looking for wrecked vehicles and would avoid the floaters.</p>
        <p>''Water damage is risky,'' said Arvin Patel of Utica, N.Y., who was at the auction to buy cars for a dealer. ''You can have trouble now, or you could have trouble later.''</p>
        <p>Carlos Davis can attest to that. Mr. Davis, a 24-year-old inventory-control clerk, bought a 1996 Chevrolet Cavalier in Rocky Mount, N.C., last year. He paid $9,000 for the car, which had 29,000 miles on the odometer.</p>
        <p>He drove the burgundy Cavalier home to Washington, D.C., to use for his 30-mile commute to his job. Two months later, the ''check engine'' light mysteriously came on. Mr. Davis had the car fixed by the North Carolina dealer, then spent $1,000 over the next two months on repairs to the alternator, headlights and wiper motor. A Chevrolet dealer eventually told him the car had a flood title, which Mr. Davis said he had not seen. The title had remained with the dealer, who financed the sale.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis's case bolsters Ms. Hepp's theory about the lag time between a storm and the appearance of its casualties on used-car lots. Because his car was purchased in April, the damage predated Floyd. In fact, North Carolina officials, who helped Mr. Davis obtain a replacement car from the dealer at no charge, traced the damage to a 1996 storm, Hurricane Fran.</p>
        <p>Still, mechanics say that some flooded vehicles can be fixed. Those in this camp stress the difference between salt- and fresh-water damage. (Floyd produced both.) They also make much of the water line on the vehicle, often used by insurers to assess the loss.</p>
        <p>''Some of the cars were not totaled; they could be repaired for resale,'' said an official with a state auto dealers' association, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, lest his group be identified with the notion that flooded cars were being resold. ''It depends on the car.''</p>
        <p>Walter Hedge, owner of Walt's Water Works in Virginia Beach, Va., has drying equipment in his shop, which specializes in fixing leaks around sunroofs and windshields. But he said he would not try to repair a flooded car.</p>
        <p>''If the ignition hasn't been turned on, and it hasn't been in salt water, maybe you can salvage it,'' he said. ''But nowadays, you've got so much electrical stuff in the car that you can just have one problem after another and it will never be right.'' Even if the water line is low, he said, there are sometimes sensors and computer controls under the seats.</p>
        <p>In the end, splitting hairs over the type of water involved or how deeply the car was immersed cannot obscure the fact that floods damage cars. Mark Herr, director of the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs, said, ''When's the last time water did a vehicle any good except at a car wash?''</p>
