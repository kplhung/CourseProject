        <p>Time Warner lost more than a skirmish over money with ABC this week when it backed down from kicking the network's programs off its cable service. Its blunt use of monopoly power was an instant public-relations disaster, and in the long run could enter the annals of business history as a famous strategic blunder. For by overriding the information and entertainment needs of millions of customers, Time Warner virtually compelled federal regulators to take a more searching look at Time Warner's proposed merger with AOL.</p>
        <p>After all, if Time Warner behaves this way now in response to Disney, the parent of ABC and a media giant itself, how will it behave after it joins forces with AOL? More to the point, will the merged company use its control of cable television's vital electronic pipeline to favor its own programs and deny competing programs fair access to millions of consumers along that pipeline?</p>
        <p>Now that federal authorities have been forewarned about Time Warner's muscular, proprietary attitude, they cannot consider approval of the Time Warner-AOL merger a foregone conclusion. If it is approved, the Federal Communications Commission or Federal Trade Commission should impose stiff conditions that would make it impossible for Time Warner to behave in the future as the company behaved this week.</p>
        <p>It must be remembered that the F.C.C. has a mandate to protect the public interest in the communications and information industries. Its responsibilities go beyond the narrow questions of anti-competitive business practices examined by the antitrust authorities in the Justice Department or, in this case, the Federal Trade Commission. The F.C.C. must protect the broader public interest in the free flow of information and in open access to electronic commerce.</p>
        <p>The fundamental problem for the F.C.C. is that cable companies like AT&amp;T and Time Warner own not only the cable wire that runs into everyone's home, but also some of the programs that are delivered over that wire. That puts them in position to discriminate in favor of the program channels they own, and therefore to filter the information and commercial opportunities presented to cable subscribers. Monopoly is bad enough in the orange juice or suspenders markets. It is downright dangerous when it compromises the public's right to diversified sources of news and entertainment.</p>
        <p>What divides Disney and Time Warner is not so much the current financial arrangement as it is the emerging issue of parity of services and future income opportunities along the information highway. Soon cable systems will offer a panoply of digital services -- giving viewers the option, for example, of purchasing a biography from a local bookstore about a historical figure in the movie they are watching.</p>
        <p>Disney fears that Time Warner will provide better services for its own channels, like HBO or CNN, than it will for Disney's channels. To protect itself, Disney wants federal regulators to require parity, or non-discrimination. Time Warner would be required to provide equivalent services to all channels. Time Warner rejects the idea, asserting that the principle of non-discrimination sounds nice but cannot be defined or regulated before the digital services exist. Besides, it says, the services will be profitable and thus should be a matter of private negotiation, not rule-making from Washington.</p>
        <p>Time Warner has a right to make this turf-guarding argument, but the F.C.C. cannot be paralyzed by it. This battle is not just over cable broadcasts of quiz shows. Cable operators like Time-Warner already provide high-speed access to the Internet. But cable customers can use only the Internet services chosen by the cable company. This has to be an open environment, where customers have as full a choice among Internet companies as technology allows. While this page supported the Federal Communications Commission's decision last year to wait before regulating access to the Internet, this week's events remind us of the pace of change and the need for ongoing vigilance. There is now ample reason for the F.C.C. to act.</p>
        <p>The point is not that we are siding with Disney,  but that federal regulators, as they study the merger, should be guided by the same principle in regard to Internet access and digital television services: non-discrimination. Time Warner says there is no need for federal regulations because it does not in fact discriminate against programs it does not own and has promised to provide open access to the Internet. But the public need not rely on voluntary compliance.</p>
        <p>Federal regulators balked last year because they did not know how to enforce non-discrimination. But that need not bring oversight to a halt. They can declare the principle of non-discrimination without issuing a bevy of rules. The mere announcement puts cable companies on notice that, as soon as technology allows, they will be required to treat all Internet companies and cable programmers the same. If they decide to design their systems otherwise, they will be held accountable.</p>
        <p>Such a policy would probably serve the long-term financial interests of this newspaper and many other media companies. But the decision, in the end, must be shaped by the public interest. Democracy requires an open communication environment. Monopoly control over cable access threatens the flow of ideas and opinion that feeds the democratic process, not to mention the emerging electronic economy. For now, perhaps, only the principle of non-discrimination can be declared, with the rule book to be written as conditions require. But the Time Warner-ABC conflict proves that it is time to start declaring principles and working on instituting them.</p>
