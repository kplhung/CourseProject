        <p>New York City officials escalated their fight against the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey yesterday, announcing that they would hire the operator of London's airports to monitor the agency's management of Kennedy and La Guardia Airports, and possibly to take them over.</p>

        <p>New York City officials escalated their fight against the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey yesterday, announcing that they would hire the operator of London's airports to monitor the agency's management of Kennedy and La Guardia Airports, and possibly to take them over.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said in a statement released yesterday that the city had chosen BAA USA Inc. as its management consultant and likely future operator of the city's airports when the Port Authority lease expires in 2015.</p>
        <p>BAA is a publicly held company based in London that got its start as the government agency running Heathrow Airport. In the last 15 years, it has gone private and led the privatization of airport operations and the transformation of airports, from Rome to Melbourne, into retail hubs.</p>
        <p>''New Yorkers and visitors to the city are not getting the kind of service they deserve and that a great city deserves from our airports,'' said Mr. Giuliani, echoing a long-held complaint by his administration that the Port Authority has favored development and growth at Newark Airport over the New York City airports and has diverted $150 million annually from city airport revenues.</p>
        <p>''The Port Authority has proven itself unable or unwilling to maintain J.F.K. and La Guardia as first class airports,'' he said.</p>
        <p>John Dyson, chairman of the Mayor's Council of Economic Advisers, who helped evaluate the four bids that the city received in its quest for a new operator, said that he hoped the port agency would ''see the handwriting on the wall'' and negotiate a quicker exit to the lease.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Port Authority said that the agency would have no comment on the city announcement. But some within the agency and on its board of commissioners said privately that they did not believe the city was seriously committed to such a takeover. They also questioned the legality of efforts by the current mayor to dictate a management agreement for whoever is mayor 15 years from now.</p>
        <p>And the plan drew immediate criticism from community leaders in the Queens communities adjacent to the airports.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Braton, chairwoman of Community Board 10, which covers the area adjacent to Kennedy, said the community had not been consulted about a process that, she said, could turn the airports over to companies that value profits over the wishes of local residents.</p>
        <p>David C. Soumi, the vice president of BAA's United States subsidiary, based in Sterling, Va., said he was pleased with the confidence the city had shown in the company. In the past, Mr. Soumi had said that the New York area airports were so important in international travel and so potentially lucrative ''that it is inconceivable that we would not take a look at getting involved.''</p>
