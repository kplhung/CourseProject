        <p>D'Amelio Terras Gallery</p>

        <p>Through May 13</p>
        <p>It's unusual to see sculpture that might simultaneously put artists as different as Stephen Balkenhol and Tom Friedman out of business. But both Mr. Balkenhol's rough-hewn wood figures and Mr. Friedman's obsessive, seemingly impossible feats of skill may seem a tad obsolete when you first encounter Karin Sander's new work.</p>
        <p>This young German artist is known for subtle architectural interventions; in her 1994 Projects show at the Museum of Modern Art, she polished painting-sized squares of wall throughout the building to a porcelainlike high gloss. Her fourth solo show in New York marks a departure of means but not effect.</p>

        <p>D'Amelio Terras Gallery</p>
        <p>525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea</p>
        <p>Through May 13</p>
        <p>It's unusual to see sculpture that might simultaneously put artists as different as Stephen Balkenhol and Tom Friedman out of business. But both Mr. Balkenhol's rough-hewn wood figures and Mr. Friedman's obsessive, seemingly impossible feats of skill may seem a tad obsolete when you first encounter Karin Sander's new work.</p>
        <p>This young German artist is known for subtle architectural interventions; in her 1994 Projects show at the Museum of Modern Art, she polished painting-sized squares of wall throughout the building to a porcelainlike high gloss. Her fourth solo show in New York marks a departure of means but not effect.</p>
        <p>It contains 36 miniature figurative sculptures of people in contemporary dress, none more than four inches high. On first encounter they seem to be casually and confidently hand carved (like Mr. Balkenhol's work), albeit out of a space-age plastic. They also appear to be breathtakingly realistic, the creation of some obsessive perfectionist (like Mr. Friedman). But in short order one starts to suspect that the delicate roughness of their surfaces is not man-made.</p>
        <p>A veracity that is both soulful and physical insinuates itself. These figures feel disturbingly, intimately true: varied in physical posture, emotional presence and facial expression, precise in the detailing and easy hang of their different garments, and familiar in the clear identifiability of things like shoes. (One tall, slim man seems to be wearing the latest Prada loafers, color-coordinated with a light-blue suit.) In addition the forms and surfaces are defined by exquisite, consistent horizontal ridges, as if carved with a needle.</p>
        <p>In fact the Lilliputian figures are three-dimensional computer-made portraits that resulted when Ms. Sander combined two new technologies available at two companies in Germany that had never worked together. The starting point was a full-length, three-dimensional laser scan of a person made with 16 digital cameras manufactured by Tecmath, a company that works mostly with the fashion industry. These measurements were then taken to Glatz, an engineering company that makes prototypes, small models and parts. There they were fed into a machine that, through a process called fused deposition modeling, built a three-dimensional figure by spraying paper-thin cross-sections of ABS plastic according to the body contours of the subject (hence, the delicate ridges) at a 1:10 scale. The resulting figure was then painted with an airbrush by a technician.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sander's subjects include herself, the technicians she worked with, and prominent citizens of Kaiserslautern and Olpe, where the companies are situated, as well as friends and art world professionals. (The man in light blue is Olivier Renaud-Clement, a New York photography dealer.) Apart from their concentrated emotional impact and disconcerting eye-of-Gulliver perspective, they offer tantalizing glimpses of the future, and not just for art. We can expect a marked improvement at places like Madame Toussaud's, and we also have the possibility of seeing something we almost never see and may not want to: ourselves in the round.</p>
