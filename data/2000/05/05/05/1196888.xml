        <p>Most children know exactly how to get to Sesame Street: turn on the television set at the appointed time. But now an alternative route leads straight to Crown Heights, Brooklyn, hour after hour after hour.</p>
        <p>That's where the Brooklyn Children's Museum is showing ''Can You Tell Me How to Get to Sesame Street?'' This interactive traveling exhibition recreates the set of the PBS series, from the famous front stoop next to Oscar's garbage can to the stores where the furry, the feathered and the just plain friendly congregate.</p>
        <p>Paul Pearson, the museum's director of exhibitions, pointed out Big Bird's nest, where children can curl up and read. ''It can be continually taken apart and remade,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Muppets on view include Big Bird, Elmo, Rosita, Bert and Ernie. Other cast members will visit on various weekends; they are also featured in videos and a photo gallery.</p>
        <p>The gallery is ''like the hall of fame,'' said Jennifer J. Collins, the museum's vice president for development and marketing. With frames in different shapes, it's a subtle lesson in geometry, too.</p>
        <p>Among the exhibition's other educational elements are a crank that changes one of the letters in a three-letter word. Children can also play with letters hung on hooks; write and post a message to a character (it will be delivered); explore Sesame Street virtually on computers; and match foods with their names and colors at the bodega, where they will also learn a little Spanish.</p>
        <p>The high points for most children, however, are likely to be the stations where they can become ''Sesame Street'' stars. There's a puppet theater with a video monitor where they can watch themselves perform and a studio in which they can count or practice the alphabet against a video backdrop that features a Muppet. Bring a blank videotape, and you'll leave with your own ''monster movie,'' one guaranteed not to give anyone nightmares.</p>
        <p>''Can You Tell Me How to Get to Sesame Street?'' Through Sept. 3 at the Brooklyn Children's Museum, 145 Brooklyn Avenue, at St. Mark's Avenue, Crown Heights, (718) 735-4400. Spring hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 2 to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free, with suggested admission: $4.</p>
        <p>Speaking Volumes</p>
        <p>An amazing rescue just took place in Brooklyn. Thousands, trapped in a basement for years, were released from cramped and dusty captivity.</p>
        <p>This wasn't the conclusion to an awful crime, but simply the end to business as usual at the central branch of the Brooklyn Public Library. And the victims weren't people but children's books.</p>
        <p>''Two-thirds of the children's collection had been in storage,'' said Elisabeth Martin, the library's director of planning, design and facilities, as she gave a tour of the new Youth Wing. ''Now nine-tenths of it is here.''</p>
        <p>The $2.5 million renovation and expansion of the Youth Wing, which opens today, was based on a principle that is anathema to parents but sensible for library planners: give children everything they want. That included lots of technology and ''a variety of scales,'' Ms. Martin said.</p>
        <p>One demand was difficult: a treehouse. But the architects, Pasanella &amp; Klein Stolzman &amp; Berg, designed something almost as alluring: a technology loft with 36 computers.</p>
        <p>The wing also includes reading alcoves, a teenage reading room, a programming room for films and a crafts and storytelling room with light fixtures in the shape of stars.</p>
        <p>''We'll have programs where kids can come in with their pajamas on for bedtime stories,'' said David C. Mowery, division chief of Central Library Youth Services. (The first is to be on May 18.) Tomorrow at 2 p.m. the wing will offer storytelling and arts and crafts for 7- to 12-year-olds.</p>
        <p>The wing also has floor-to-ceiling windows and quotations on the walls from children's classics. But visitors may not pay them much heed; they'll be too busy reading.</p>
        <p>Youth Wing, the Brooklyn Public Library, Grand Army Plaza, Park Slope, (718) 230-2119. Hours: Mondays through Thursdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 5 p.m. Free.</p>
        <p>Snap Judgments</p>
        <p>Parents, cameras in hand, are always chasing their children, demanding a picture. This weekend the International Center of Photography will let little ones snap their parents, and other creatures, too.</p>
        <p>The fun is in two family workshops, to be led by Mark LaRocca. Tomorrow at ''Birds and Worms'' children can study perspective by photographing wildlife in the Conservatory Garden. ''They'll get assignments, like 'Photograph a flower from above as if you were a bee,' '' said Cynthia Way, the center's coordinator of community programs.</p>
        <p>On Sunday at ''The Portrait'' they will first look at examples by photographers like Walker Evans and Margaret Bourke-White. Then it's off to a nearby playground to practice on Mom, Dad and amenable siblings.</p>
        <p>''The negotiation is the fun part: figuring out what you want to say about someone you love and how to bring that out,'' Ms. Way said.</p>
        <p>The center will provide Polaroid cameras simple enough for small children. There are no age limits, however, for the workshops. The more diverse the group, the more interesting the perspectives.</p>
        <p>''Birds and Worms,'' tomorrow from 1 to 3:30 p.m., and ''The Portrait,'' on Sunday from 1 to 3 p.m., at the International Center of Photography, 1130 Fifth Avenue, at 94th Street, (212) 860-1776, extension 100. Admission: $10 a family; members, $8 a family. Registration required.</p>
