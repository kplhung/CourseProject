        <p>The news that the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges have agreed to merge is a warning to the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>The technology revolution has changed the securities market, and to survive, our exchanges must change with it. Already, new technology-driven markets in Europe have overtaken well-established markets.

        <p>The news that the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges have agreed to merge is a warning to the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>The technology revolution has changed the securities market, and to survive, our exchanges must change with it. Already, new technology-driven markets in Europe have overtaken well-established markets. For instance, last fall, the Eurex, a British electronic exchange created only nine years ago, supplanted the Chicago Board of Trade as the dominant exchange for metal, grain and financial futures.</p>
        <p>It may seem hard to believe, but for two centuries the New York Stock Exchange has operated mostly as a monopoly: all stocks listed on the exchange had to be traded through it. In 1979, bowing to pressure from investors, the Big Board allowed new stocks to be traded on other exchanges.</p>
        <p>Later this year, succumbing to pressure from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the exchange will allow any stock to be traded on any exchange. This expansion will help electronic exchanges like Instinet, Island and Archipelago, which match buyers and sellers more quickly and less expensively than the New York Stock Exchange, with its reliance on ''floor specialists'' who oversee all trading in a particular company's stock.</p>
        <p>The New York Stock Exchange will face head-to-head competition for the first time, yet its members  can't agree on how to respond. Some members believe that it must upgrade or risk extinction. Others argue that floor specialists give investors an advantage that no computer can provide -- they often get investors better prices for their stock. Besides, because the exchange is so strongly associated with high standards and stringent regulation, they argue, it will always attract trillions of investment dollars.</p>
        <p>The Chicago Board was plagued by similar divisions. Internal disputes about the future led to paralysis; the board didn't make the shift toward more efficient, less expensive electronic trading. By the time the members realized their error, investors had already flocked to the Eurex.</p>
        <p>The New York Stock Exchange must avoid this mistake. But how can it, when the exchange operates like a dues-paying cooperative, where floor traders and brokerage houses must make decisions by consensus -- even though they often have very different views? And why would floor traders ever agree to electronic trading when their very livelihood depends on the floor-trading model?</p>
        <p>The answer is surprisingly simple. The New York Stock Exchange must transform itself from a member-owned nonprofit organization into a shareholder-owned, profit-driven, bottom-line company. Instead of a chairman answering to exchange members, it would have a chief executive officer answering to a board of directors that demanded efficiency, fairness and profit.</p>
        <p>By switching to a corporate structure, the exchange, through a public or private offering, can raise the billion dollars or more it will need to build or acquire an electronic trading system. It can offer investors a choice: the current floor specialist who may be able to get the customer a better deal on a trade, or the quicker, more efficient, but less adaptive computer trade. A corporate structure could also offer floor traders stock options, which might persuade them to support electronic trading.</p>
        <p>With its impressive market share, the New York Stock Exchange remains the odds-on favorite to beat the global competition. But the exchange cannot waste any time in adapting to the new world. That's what happened in Chicago. Now it's No. 2.</p>
        <p>Can't happen here? That's what they said in Chicago.</p>
