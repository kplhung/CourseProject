        <p>The four enamel-on-metal paintings in this show are based on close-up photographs Ms. Minter took of a man wearing women's clothes and makeup. A bit of lace falls across a hirsute chest. A set of tough-looking toenails are painted avocado green. The painting style is glossy but fluent, like a Surrealist version of early James Rosenquist, with the sense of a hand behind the brush.</p>
        <p>Like Surrealism, Ms. Minter's work mines the fetishistic charge of the anatomical fragment. Those detached toes could be male or female. They look dirty or hairy or bruised. The color of the nail polish is unsavory and repellent, not alluring in the way such gender-specific touches are meant to be.</p>

        <p>Xavier LaBoulenne</p>

        <p>The four enamel-on-metal paintings in this show are based on close-up photographs Ms. Minter took of a man wearing women's clothes and makeup. A bit of lace falls across a hirsute chest. A set of tough-looking toenails are painted avocado green. The painting style is glossy but fluent, like a Surrealist version of early James Rosenquist, with the sense of a hand behind the brush.</p>
        <p>Like Surrealism, Ms. Minter's work mines the fetishistic charge of the anatomical fragment. Those detached toes could be male or female. They look dirty or hairy or bruised. The color of the nail polish is unsavory and repellent, not alluring in the way such gender-specific touches are meant to be.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Minter has always had distinctive ideas about a kind of pathology of glamour. It's worth noting that the model who sat for the photos on which the paintings are based (one photo is included in the show) is Robert Melee, whose recent solo exhibition at Andrew Kreps was one of the more spectacularly funny oddities of the season (and a personal favorite).</p>
        <p>The two artists have much in common, beginning with the fact that both have used their eccentric but star-quality mothers as subjects of their work. More than anything, though, it is their interest in turning gender-scrambling eroticism into high theater that puts them out there on some edge or other, with Mr. Melee way, way out and Ms. Minter not quite so far out.</p>
