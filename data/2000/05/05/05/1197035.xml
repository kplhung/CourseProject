        <p>South Korea's largest conglomerate, the Hyundai Group, said its chairman would use personal funds as collateral in a plan to revive its ailing Hyundai Investment Trust Company. The decision by the chairman, Chung Mong Hun, came after the government rejected a request from Hyundai for state financing to rescue the investment trust. If the cash flow situation worsens, Mr. Chung will provide collateral valued by the company at 1.7 trillion won ($1.5 billion) raised from stakes in three affiliates: Hyundai Information and Technology, Hyundai Logistics and Hyundai Autonet.</p>
