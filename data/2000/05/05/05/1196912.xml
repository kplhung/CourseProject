        <p>A May 2 letter writer presumes to speak for ''middle-of-the-road gays'' who ''resent being taken for granted by the Democratic Party'' and want a ''return to decency, honesty and virtue in the White House,'' even if this means voting for George W.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A May 2 letter writer presumes to speak for ''middle-of-the-road gays'' who ''resent being taken for granted by the Democratic Party'' and want a ''return to decency, honesty and virtue in the White House,'' even if this means voting for George W. Bush. My middle-of-the-road gay experience is very different from his.</p>
        <p>I question his assertion that he is ''savvy enough'' to balance his commitments both for equal rights for gays and national integrity when he would support a Republican for president who opposes all calls for equal rights for gays: no hate crimes legislation, no legal recognition of same-gender committed relationships, and no right to serve openly in the armed forces. Equal rights and national integrity are indivisible.</p>
