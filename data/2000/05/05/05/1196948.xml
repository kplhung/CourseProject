        <p>A major drug trafficker who officials said oversaw daily smuggling operations for the Tijuana drug cartel has been arrested and charged with racketeering and murder, Mexican authorities said today.</p>
        <p>The trafficker, Ismael Higuera Guerrero, was seized on Wednesday in what American officials called a major victory in the fight against drugs. He was captured after traffickers and soldiers exchanged gunfire and the soldiers lobbed tear gas grenades into a Pacific coast mansion at Ensenada, 60 miles south of Tijuana, the authorities said.</p>

        <p>A major drug trafficker who officials said oversaw daily smuggling operations for the Tijuana drug cartel has been arrested and charged with racketeering and murder, Mexican authorities said today.</p>
        <p>The trafficker, Ismael Higuera Guerrero, was seized on Wednesday in what American officials called a major victory in the fight against drugs. He was captured after traffickers and soldiers exchanged gunfire and the soldiers lobbed tear gas grenades into a Pacific coast mansion at Ensenada, 60 miles south of Tijuana, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Higuera was flown to central Mexico and jailed in a top-security prison outside Toluca, west of Mexico City, on Wednesday night, they said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Higuera emerged as a key lieutenant to the Arellano Felix brothers, who head the Tijuana cartel, in the mid-1990's, when police pressure forced them to delegate many cartel operations to subordinates, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>A statement by the Drug Enforcement Administration today called Mr. Higuera, who is 39, ''the most visible member'' of the cartel.</p>
        <p>His arrest follows a period of ferocious drug warfare in the western state of Sinaloa, in Mexico City and especially in Tijuana, which has recorded more than 100 murders this year.</p>
        <p>President Ernesto Zedillo ordered a crackdown on traffickers during a visit to Tijuana in February, but three days later the city's police chief was gunned down, and on April 10 a senior federal prosecutor and two aides sent from Mexico City to Tijuana to investigate the cartel were abducted, beaten to death and hurled into a ravine.</p>
        <p>At a news conference in the attorney general's downtown office here today, Mariano Herran Salvatti, Mexico's special prosecutor for drug crimes, said that Mr. Higuera had ordered many killings and that it was an official hypothesis that he may have ordered the April 10 murders. But he said investigators had not yet developed evidence to confirm that.</p>
        <p>A senior Mexican official said in a recent interview that a new war between the Tijuana cartel and a smuggling group headed by one of the Arellano Felix brothers' former lieutenants, Ismael Zambada Garcia, was contributing to the current violence.</p>
        <p>Other experts have said a broad restructuring of the narcotics industry is under way, with alliances between traffickers and corrupt officials under strain as President Zedillo's presidency nears its end.</p>
        <p>In February the Tijuana cartel's top financial operator was also arrested.</p>
        <p>Mr. Herran said today that the two arrests were signs of dramatic progress. ''We're witnessing the dismantling of the Tijuana cartel,'' he said.</p>
