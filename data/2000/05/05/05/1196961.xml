        <p>Brokerage firms, charged with executing investors' buy and sell orders fairly, are flouting securities rules intended to ensure that investors receive the best possible prices on their trades, a Securities and Exchange Commission report has asserted.</p>
        <p>The report, which was made public yesterday, studied practices at a sampling of the nation's stock and options exchanges and brokerage-firm trading desks in 1999. It also found that these institutions' self-policing operations were ill equipped to identify regulatory missteps among traders and did little about them when they were discovered.</p>
        <p>At issue is the treatment of investors who place orders to buy and sell a stock or option at a specified price, known as a limit order.</p>
        <p>By placing such an order and having it displayed to the overall market, a buyer wishing to pay a price slightly below the prevailing market price for a stock may attract a seller willing to effect the trade who otherwise might not have come forward. The buyer's limit order, therefore, affords him the chance of paying a lower price for his shares than he would have paid, had he been willing to buy at the prevailing price. So the proper display of customer limit orders can lead to an improvement in stock purchase prices.</p>
        <p>''Limit orders are in my judgment the absolute stimulant of price competition,'' said Arthur Levitt, the S.E.C. chairman, ''and either neglect or inattention to the rules that empowered limit orders is an assault on the price-setting process.''</p>
        <p>How limit orders are treated is of great significance to the market because they account for two-thirds of all orders on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.</p>
        <p>A brokerage house that fails to promptly display a limit order makes it increasingly likely that the investor will miss his chance to buy or sell because the market in the stock has moved.</p>
        <p>Abuse of customer limit orders was at the heart of the investigations into the Nasdaq stock market conducted by the S.E.C. and the Justice Department in the mid-1990's. Professional traders on Nasdaq were found to have routinely failed to display customer limit orders at prices that were better than the prevailing market price, keeping this important price information -- and the profits generated by trading against it -- to themselves.</p>
        <p>In the wake of this investigation, the S.E.C. enacted rules in 1996 requiring that stock exchange specialists and Nasdaq market makers display customer limit orders that improve the prevailing market price within 30 seconds of having received them.</p>
        <p>But yesterday's report indicated that four years after they were introduced, these regulations are not being followed assiduously at all Wall Street firms or exchanges.</p>
        <p>''Compliance is terrible by the market makers and specialists we looked at,'' said Lori A. Richards, director of the office of compliance inspections and examinations at the S.E.C.</p>
        <p>The commission declined to identify which brokerage firms and exchanges it sampled. But at three large Nasdaq trading firms, it said it found violations of limit-order display rules in 46 percent, 58 percent and 92 percent of trades sampled.</p>
        <p>And even though many firms have automatic limit-order display systems, the orders are still not displayed properly. All of the exchanges studied were found by the commission to allow their traders to override automatic order display systems. And at one Nasdaq dealer firm, an employee disconnected the automatic system for the firm's entire trading desk for several months without detection by the brokerage house.</p>
        <p>Even more troubling, the report said that the self-regulatory organizations set up to police the operations of brokerage firms could not provide accurate data on whether or not customer limit orders were being displayed properly by their members. According to the S.E.C., some of these organizations conduct no surveillance of order handling at all; others approach their duties haphazardly.</p>
        <p>Once violations were found, the self-regulators failed to refer the incidents to their investigatory staffs. The S.E.C. said that one regulatory official admitted that no disciplinary actions had been imposed even when there were many violations of the display rule.</p>
        <p>Leonard J. Amoruso, chief compliance officer at Knight/Trimark, the nation's largest Nasdaq dealer firm, said of the report, ''Our systems are fully compliant with the order-handling rules, and we surveil that internally to ensure that our trading programs are working properly.''</p>
        <p>Ray Pellechia, a spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange, said: ''The exchange has very aggressive and comprehensive surveillance and enforcement of the limit-order display rule. We will, of course, review the S.E.C. report to determine if any changes to our regulatory program are appropriate.''</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. said that a result of its study would be increased scrutiny of market participants to ensure that limit orders are displayed and rules followed.</p>
        <p>''I think the rules are at the core of the integrity of our markets and we take these violations seriously,'' Mr. Levitt said.</p>
