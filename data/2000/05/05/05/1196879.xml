        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>''AFRICAN MASTERWORKS FROM THE COLLECTION OF BEATRICE RIESE,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Sept. 10). Beatrice Riese, a New York abstract painter who saw her first African sculpture in 1937 in Paris, has collected a wealth of impressive objects, 30 of which are in this show. They include fine bronze Benin plaques and a female ancestor mask from Angola with scars like tears on its cheeks. Especially magnetic is a Songye power figure with a bunched-up body and a sideways-looking face. He's a compact monument to ferocity. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $4; $2, students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).</p>

        <p>''AFRICAN MASTERWORKS FROM THE COLLECTION OF BEATRICE RIESE,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Sept. 10). Beatrice Riese, a New York abstract painter who saw her first African sculpture in 1937 in Paris, has collected a wealth of impressive objects, 30 of which are in this show. They include fine bronze Benin plaques and a female ancestor mask from Angola with scars like tears on its cheeks. Especially magnetic is a Songye power figure with a bunched-up body and a sideways-looking face. He's a compact monument to ferocity. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $4; $2, students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).</p>
        <p>* ''ART AND ORACLE: SPIRIT VOICES OF AFRICA,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through July 30). This is the first big international loan exhibition of African art to appear at the Met outside the Michael C. Rockefeller wing, and it is gorgeous. The subject is divination, the practice of channeling superhuman knowledge to predict the future, diagnose illness and promote social harmony. Nearly every object here has a role to play in that process or reflects its effects, from a ''power figure'' that looks as explosive as a stick of dynamite, to a Yoruba divination tray believed to be the oldest African wood sculpture in the West, to the portrait of a king who was warned by diviners to beware of water and had himself depicted as half-fish. (He ended up in exile far across the Atlantic in Martinique.) Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 8:45 p.m. Suggested admission: $10 for adults; $5 for students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''ART IN THE AGE OF QUEEN VICTORIA: TREASURES FROM THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS PERMANENT COLLECTION,'' National Academy of Design Museum, Fifth Avenue at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through June 4). The Royal Academy, founded in 1768 and still going strong, was a driving force in British art in the 19th century. Spurned by more progressive artists like James MacNeill Whistler, it was a showcase for proper Victorians. The 76 paintings and sculptures here, spanning Victoria's reign, include biblical and mythological scenes, genre subjects with morality themes, swashbuckling costume portraits, idealized nudes, exotic tales, behind-the-battle glimpses, landscapes and seascapes. Among the more appealing and amusing works is Richard Redgrave's ''Outcast'' (1851), in which an outraged father dismisses his fallen daughter and her illegitimate baby. ''Treasures'' like these make this wonderfully fustian display worth visiting. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5 (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>''BIENNIAL 2000,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through June 4). A show without a theme: no strong point of view, not much sex, no dead pigs, no fecal matter or rotting eggs or mannequins with a penis for a nose. Sounds boring, no? This committee-organized Biennial goes out of its way to be ecumenical, independent, geographically diverse, representative of all media including the Internet and different from what the New York power brokers would do. All this may be admirable. It's also truer than previous biennials to what goes on across the country, truer to the character of the American scene, where artists come from other countries, more respectful of different generations and multiple strategies. And flat. Notwithstanding Hans Haacke's forgettable noisemaker, it is the most uncontroversial Biennial in years, which is not good. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, 1 to 8 p.m. Admission: $12.50; $10.50, students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* ''COLLECTION IN CONTEXT,'' Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500 (through May 28). This group show, organized from the permanent collection by the museum's new director of exhibitions and programs, Thelma Golden, has all kinds of smart alignments and enchanting pairings. Between two impressive portraits -- a little girl in vermilion slippers by the early African-American artist Joshua Johnson (circa 1735-1830) and Barkley Hendricks's image of a 1970's Black Pride beauty set against a gilded background like a Renaissance saint -- come small pieces by Sister Gertrude Morgan, Alma Thomas, Meta Warrick Fuller and Jacob Lawrence that feel like discovered gifts. Also on view is a selection of Harlem photographs by James VanDerZee. Hours: Wednesdays and Thursdays, noon to 6 p.m.; Fridays, noon to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $3, students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>* WALKER EVANS, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through May 14). It is curious that such a prickly man could have made such affecting photographs, but maybe that is why they are moving: sentiment is perfectly balanced by dispassion. Evans was after a poetry that would not be called beautiful, not conventionally beautiful anyway. The Met's outstanding survey, the first complete Evans retrospective, sweeps across six decades, including the photographs he took with a Polaroid SX-70 in 1973 and '74, which were his last works. We see what we already knew: that American documentary photography is derived from his mordant concentration, his elevation of the everyday and his belligerent independence, which was maybe his most truly American trait. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* ''GREATER NEW YORK,'' P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through May 16). This huge survey of new art is the first curatorial collaboration between P.S. 1 and the Museum of Modern Art. With a whopping 150 artists, it is a themeless, selected-by-committee show with the kind of institutional clout that can make the art world see red. The same formula has caused the Whitney Biennial headaches for years, but in this case it works. It ends up producing a good if uneven exhibition with flashes of inspiration. Its tone is low key, distinctly unsensational. With a third of the artists foreign born there is a cosmopolitan undercurrent. It leaves a million things out. (New York has dozens of art worlds; only a few are represented here.) But as a highly selective recap of what's cooking in new art locally -- in this case the five boroughs, along with a fringe of Westchester -- it is invaluable. In short, an important beginning to the decade. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5 (Cotter).</p>
        <p>* ''MAKING CHOICES, 1920-1960,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Sept. 26). The main event at the Museum of Modern Art these days is the museum itself. This has been the case since last fall, when a project called ''MoMA 2000'' kicked off the first of what will be three successive top-to-bottom reinstallations of the permanent collection galleries. The affair has been billed as a test drive toward the future, a chance for an institution to rethink the modern art tradition it helped to invent and to consider its own identity in what is often called a postmodern world. This second installment, which looks denser, weirder, messier and more truly modern (or maybe postmodern) than the first, is a big leap in the right direction. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>* ''THE PRINZHORN COLLECTION: TRACES UPON THE WUNDERBLOCK,'' Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166 (through June 10). The legendary Prinzhorn Collection, amassed just before and after World War I in Heidelberg, Germany, is one of the originating points of the study and appreciation of art by the insane. The collection's first New York appearance is a mine of exciting new information: 200 drawings and handmade books that often stun the eye and always touch the heart, by mostly unfamiliar artists. It is also very much a time capsule; its contents clearly reflect an era when penmanship was taught and valued, when ledgers were kept, and when religious images and farm animals were part of everyday life. Its suggestion that the art of the insane is not pure, timeless and autonomous, but part of a larger continuum of art and visual culture, may be the exhibition's most valuable lesson. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free (Roberta Smith).</p>
        <p>* ''TILMAN RIEMENSCHNEIDER: MASTER SCULPTOR OF THE LATE MIDDLE AGES,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500 (through May 14). This stunning show is the first full-scale survey of the greatest of the late 14th-century German sculptors, creator of some of the most quietly virtuosic, spiritually focused yet undeniably dynamic figurative works of Western sculpture. There are 60 works from 45 ensembles -- saints, Madonnas and scenes from the life of Jesus -- usually close to life size, in the round and in relief, in sandstone, alabaster and limewood. The great monochrome carved pieces predominate, with alpine topographies of drapery that wrap their revered subjects in what are effectively abstract sculptures. They are radical, mesmerizingly complex visual propositions whose crystalline forms and introspective faces speak simultaneously of the power of human faith and aesthetic will. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>* LUCIAN FREUD, Acquavella Gallery, 18 East 79th Street, (212) 734-6300 (through May 19). The emotional pitch of this show, Mr. Freud's first in New York in four years, is subtler than last time. Of 35 paintings and prints, three are landscapes, including a big bird's-eye view of the shuttered garden beside his London town house, an antipicturesque image that's about the elevating value of steady, unforgiving observation. The same philosophy applies to the pictures of people, some of his best in years, including a vertiginous, voluptuously painted portrait of a female model face down and a portrait of his daughter Ib reading. At the heart of the art is the idea that truth without sentiment is beauty, and that beauty becomes erotic not when it involves an attractive naked young woman on a bed, but when it attaches to deep feeling. There aren't many artists today operating on this level (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* LEON KOSSOFF, Mitchell-Innes &amp; Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 744-7400 (through May 20). Mr. Kossoff's show includes more than 20 paintings and drawings of his neighborhood around Kings Cross Station in London. He has studied this neighborhood season by season: what may at first glance look like inspired squiggles turn out to be close observations of fact. There are also some very fine portrait drawings and large paintings of old friends doing nothing in particular in the studio and wearing nothing at all. The strong clear light of New York gives these paintings and drawings a particular radiance. (A completely different aspect of Mr. Kossoff at work can be seen at the Metropolitan Museum, where 14 of his etchings after Poussin are on view through Aug. 13) (John Russell).</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>MIQUEL BARCELO, Grant Selwyn, 37 West 57th Street, (212) 755-0434 (through May 13). This Spanish painter presents a series of large rough ceramic vessels, most with animal imagery molded into the body of the piece. In one instance the bottom of a wall-hung dish is sculptured into a toy-size elephant, its trunk floating free of the gouged-out edge of the plate. Most impressive is a five-foot cylindrical piece with a fuzzy camel wrapped all the way around (Ken Johnson).</p>
        <p>* JENNIFER BARTLETT, Lawrence Rubin, Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212) 445-0444 (through May 13). Ms. Bartlett continues her use of the rambling, multipart grid system established by her painting ''Rhapsody,'' which first brought her acclaim 25 years ago. On the square plates that form the grid, her imagery -- abstract or narrative -- is formed by dots. In her narrative paintings she shapes them into trees, figures, houses and domestic rites by manipulating their colors. But in her more vivacious abstractions, the dots take on their own personae, sometimes confined to grids but others expanding into brilliantly colored, sometimes ringed, circles of various sizes bursting out of their rigid confinement to form throbbing patchwork quilts of chromatic dazzle. They are her best and brightest (Glueck).</p>
        <p>DAN GRAHAM, ''Children's Day Care, CD-ROM, Cartoon and Computer Screen Library,'' Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160 (through May 20). Mr. Graham has been blurring the line between art and architecture for a long time. His latest effort is an enclosure for a day-care center. It has a rubber-tiled floor, curving glass walls that have fun-house mirror effects, and three computer stations. No doubt it will be prized as much for its sleek form as its practical function by the museum education department that acquires it (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''NATIVE AMERICAN INFLUENCES ON 1930'S AND 1940'S MODERNISTS,'' David Findlay, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 486-7660 (through May 13). American Indian art and culture inspired many American avant-gardists of the 30's and 40's just as African art earlier excited Picasso. This interesting presentation of mostly small Indian-influenced works by Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock, Adolph Gottlieb, Steve Wheeler and others would be worth expanding into a museum-scale exhibition. As it stands, the show is more conceptually intriguing than visually gratifying (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>WALTER ANDERSON, Luise Ross Gallery, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 343-2161 (through May 26). A superb draftsman whose spare line and deft lightness of touch invite comparison with Charles Demuth and Arthur Dove, Anderson (1903-1965) had a passion for birds, animals and plants that he celebrated in rhythmic compositions. A back-and-forth between birds and waves, a procession of stylized plants, a counterpoint between people and cars, are some of the themes in these drawings and paintings. The creatureliness of snakes, herons, a turtle and a prickly cactus are captured in boldly patterned drawings that fairly explode with life. In quieter renderings, shapes are defined as much by white space as by line (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''BIZARRE!,'' John Gibson, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 925-1192 (through May 27). This appropriately titled and engaging exhibition of nine large photographs includes Floria Sigismondi's nightmarish image of a person encumbered by elaborate surgical mouth gear; Margi Geerlinks's vision of an ear miraculously emerging from a woman's embroidery work; Joel-Peter Witkin's faux-Victorian, double nude portrait of a shoe fetishist and a delusional woman; and Andres Serrano's nude portrait of a female contortionist. Mac Adams, Jeanne Dunning, Cindy Sherman, Bill Beckley and John Gibson round out the show (Johnson).</p>
        <p>JACQUELINE GOUREVITCH, DFN, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 334-3400 (through May 18). Since the 1960's, Ms. Gourevitch has been painting clouds. In the best of her recent, nicely understated canvases, there is a fine balance between celestial illusionism and muted Rothkoesque abstraction (Johnson).</p>
        <p>PIERRE MOLINIER, Tony Shafrazi, 119 Wooster Street, (212) 274-9300 (through May 9). Again and again in small, dark photographs that look as though they belong to the 1930's rather than the 60's when they were made, this eccentric French artist depicted himself -- a bony man past middle age -- in high heels, stockings and garter belt, often performing autoerotic acts. His goofy, single-minded perversity would be better served by a smaller, more intimate show than this repetitive, 135-work presentation (Johnson).</p>
        <p>MUNTADAS, Kent Gallery, 67 Prince Street, and Crosby Street Project Space, 113 Crosby Street, (212) 966-4500 (through May 27). This Barcelona-born, New York multimedia artist combines politics and surrealism to stirring effect. At Kent ''The Nap'' alternates video imagery of a sleeping man's fist and exciting old newsreel scenes of city life, heavy industry and war. A video projection at Crosby Street alternates audiences clapping monotonously and black-and-white pictures of political violence. Together they evoke history as a nightmare from which we can never seem to awaken (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''PAINTING GENERATION,'' Kagan Martos, 515 Broadway, near Spring Street, (212) 343-4293 (through May 20). This intriguing, eight-work show traces an eccentric art history from 1920 to 2000. It includes a cluster of ink dots by Francis Picabia (1920); a lovely grisaille by Yves Tanguy (1946); gritty Abstract Expressionism by Alfred Leslie (1951); near-Minimalist elegance by Jo Baer (1970); soft, gray luminosity by Ross Bleckner (1981); zany calligraphic images and patterns by Amy Sillman (1995); and a mysterious, spider-webbed tchotchke painted by Randy Wray (2000) (Johnson).</p>
        <p>GEORGE SCHNEEMAN, Donahue/Sosinski, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 226-1111 (through May 13). Images from illustrations of the 1920's, 30's and 40's eccentrically collide in small, egg-tempera panel paintings. Mr. Schneeman paints with matter-of-fact directness and his odd juxtapositions -- an elegant fashion model and a bemused cartoon dwarf, for example -- have a wry, flat-footed surrealism like that of John Ashbery's poetry (Johnson).</p>
        <p>PIETER SCHOOLWERTH, American Fine Arts, 22 Wooster Street, (212) 941-0401 (through May 13). Known for his complicated, diagrammatic play with language and Pop iconography, this young Brooklyn artist has lately turned to a kind of updated Magic Realism. Full of surrealistic cliches, his bright, glossy oil paintings mostly look like sophomoric illustration; but two large pictures of hyperactive hipsters, in apartments where things mysteriously levitate, have a trippy urgency (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>STEPHAN BALKENHOL, Barbara Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9300 (through May 13). This German artist, known for his deadpan, roughly hacked and simply painted wood sculpture, presents numerous variations on his signature Everyman, a regular fellow in black pants and a white shirt. He also presents two monumental but inert nude torsos, one male, one female; bland portraits carved from flat panels; and two small giraffes. Those last remind one that Mr. Balkenhol has previously been more idiosyncratically imaginative (Johnson).</p>
        <p>NAYLAND BLAKE, Matthew Marks, 523 West 24th Street, (212) 243-0200 (through May 13). The main attraction here sounds good on paper: a large man (the artist), in a rabbit suit made to weigh as much as his boyfriend, tap-dances to the boyfriend's off-screen instructions to the point of exhaustion. The actual 23-minute video, however, is less evocative psychologically than its description. Also on view are Nan Goldin's curiously depressing photographs of Mr. Blake and his mother in her apartment, which he had lined with gingerbread squares (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* PAT DE GROOT, Pat Hearn, 530 West 22nd Street, (212) 727-7366 (through May 20). Every day, Ms. de Groot, who is in her early 70's, makes a new painting of the ocean from her window in Provincetown. This is her first New York solo show. Her small panels have a blocky physicality that calls to mind Robert Ryman or Agnes Martin, yet each records atmospheric conditions with exquisite specificity, from the white-out of dense fog to the bracing contrasts of a breezy sunny day (Johnson).</p>
        <p>FRANK GILLETTE, Universal Concepts Unlimited, 507 West 24th Street, (212) 727-7575 (through May 27). Mr. Gillette, a video-art pioneer three decades ago, here shows works produced by newer technology: swirling, complicatedly layered black-and-white abstractions made with a mouse and drawing software. Turned into iris prints and adhered to aluminum panels, they look impersonal and disembodied; as objects on the wall, however, they have a certain hovering, futuristic presence (Johnson).</p>
        <p>CLAUDIA HART AND SAM SAMORE, ''Playworld,'' Clinica Aesthetica, 427 West 14th Street, (212) 243-5345 (through May 20). This collaborative, multimedia installation about childhood and fairy tales, in the form of a brightly painted but rather empty playroom, looks like a work in progress with interesting possibilities. In an animated video by Ms. Hart, bizarre twin pigs squeal ''Mama! Mama!'' continuously; Mr. Samore contributes a frieze of evocative phrases like ''stealing the newborn'' or ''devouring beauty'' and a large, romantically hazy, ink-jet printed portrait of a little boy (Johnson).</p>
        <p>MADELEINE HATZ, Florence Lynch Gallery, 147 West 29th Street, (212) 967-7584 (through May 27). Working in two and three dimensions, Ms. Hatz pursues a two-pronged enterprise. Each of her canvases is a colorful, richly painterly abstraction suggestive of roiling, sun-drenched clouds; in sculpture, she simulates slightly miniaturized brick and mortar rubble and arranges it on steel platforms. The viewer swings back and forth between the celestial and the terrestrial (Johnson).</p>
        <p>BETSY KAUFMAN, Leslie Tonkonow, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 255-8450 (through May 20). Ms. Kaufman's precise and sensuous paintings are always based on the grid, but are otherwise unpredictably various. ''Wavers'' is a dazzling field of fine vertical lines; ''Blue Text,'' a luminous layering of streaky, pale blue paint, skewed white horizontal lines and fine dots. The paintings seem at once mathematical and poetic (Johnson).</p>
        <p>MAKI TAMURA, AC Project Room, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 645-4970 (through May 13). Ms. Tamura was born in Japan and lived in Indonesia before coming to the United States. Traces of these cultures and others show up in 20 long, scroll-like pieces that unravel across the gallery floor. They combine painted and printed images of Chinese-style landscapes, Bellini Madonnas, Indonesian textile patterns, illustrations from children's books and pornographic vignettes, many of them drawn from popular versions of ''classical'' sources (Cotter).</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>CHARLES CAJORI, New York Studio School, 8 West Eighth Street, (212) 673-6466 (through May 20). As his four-decade drawing retrospective shows, this esteemed New York Studio School teacher has always worked with the tension between the fixed reality of the female nude and the flux of perceptual and gestural response. Most of his drawings have an agitated concentration, with much overdrawing and erasing. More recent works, freed from frenetic mark making, have an incisive awkwardness and the suggestion of an Asian brevity (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>''ACTION/PERFORMANCE AND THE PHOTOGRAPH,'' Sidney Mishkin Gallery, Baruch College, 135 East 22nd Street, (212) 802-2690 (through today). What would performance artists do without the camera? This wide-ranging show documents events from the celebrated faked leap out of a second-story window by the French Conceptualist Yves Klein (1960) to Andy Goldsworthy's jubilant tossing of sticks in the air in the English countryside. An informal minihistory of performance peaks and abysses, this engaging show gives the camera its due as an essential aide and sometimes actual participant (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''ALMOST SOMETHING: DEPICTIVE ABSTRACTION,'' Catherine Moore, 140 West 30th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-8977 (through tomorrow). Abstraction and fantasy converge in this entertaining eight-artist show. Daniel Wiener's small sculpture looks like an extraterrestrial plant-animal hybrid; Peter Soriano's funky, yellow sculpture suggests a futuristic device made of Play-Doh; David Dupuis draws neat, quirky mindscapes; Giles Lyon and Alexander Ross both paint, and Gail Fitzgerald sculptures what might be realms of the microbiological; Gary Stephan's process-based painting hints at some elemental narrative; and Kim Keever photographs sublime visions in a fish tank (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ''ANCIENT FACES: MUMMY PORTRAITS FROM ROMAN EGYPT,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sunday). This time-traveling exhibition concentrates on 70 portraits produced in Egypt nearly 2,000 years ago during the first few centuries of Roman rule. The paintings, of a colonial elite that took their fashion cues from Rome, are done in a classical realist style but were intended to be placed on cloth-wrapped mummies as part of Pharaonic funerary practices. The faces of socialites and corporate types, philosophers and jocks, beaming youths and stricken girls seem to have been painted from life and are heart-stoppingly familiar. They make an unforgettable ensemble, and they are us. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''BLACK NEW YORKERS/BLACK NEW YORK,'' Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, 515 Malcolm X Boulevard, at 135th Street, Harlem, (212) 491-2200 (through Sunday). This branch of the New York Public Library offers a sweeping look at African-American life in the city through four centuries. In addition to books and handwritten documents, the show spills over with hundreds of photographs. They range from panoramic views of the Harlem Hellfighters marching up Fifth Avenue at the end of World War I to street-level shots of protest marches in 1997 in support of Abner Louima. It all adds up to a roller-coaster social chronicle by turns heartlifting and infuriating (Cotter).</p>
        <p>* CHUCK CLOSE, PaceWildenstein Gallery, 142 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 431-9224 (through tomorrow). More than ever, this artist's colossal portraits teeter on the brink of disintegration, their small luscious targets, blips and diamonds acting more like free agents than parts of a larger image. Meanwhile Mr. Close's new photographs at Pace MacGill (32 East 57th Street, through April 29) counter disintegration with the different kinds of irreducible fact possible in ink-jet digital color prints, daguerreotypes and holograms. Mr. Close's show of etchings in the same building (at Pace Prints, through May 6) unveils a new technique while unraveling the characteristically accumulative process of his art, and counts as a bravura performance on a small stage (Smith).</p>
        <p>* ''THE GUENNOL COLLECTION: CABINET OF WONDERS,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Sunday). This gorgeous sampling of mostly small objects from the collection of A. B. and Edith Martin can make you believe in collecting as an art form. From an ancient Egyptian dragonfly made of wood to a ferocious ''Woman'' painted by Willem de Kooning, the objects are extremely diverse yet unified by a singular sensibility. ''Leonine Goddess,'' made in southwestern Iran in 3000 B.C., embodies the spirit of the collection. Just over three inches tall, the smooth limestone carving represents a lion with the body of a human weight lifter. It is a dense, materially beautiful object and a haunting mythic image. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $4; $2, students and the elderly (Johnson).</p>
