        <p>Al Gore delivered a provocative foreign policy speech Sunday that raised an important question: Does George W. Bush have the experience, the gravitas and, by implication, the brains to run U.S. foreign policy?</p>
        <p>If not, said Mr. Gore, one can only assume that ''the gaps in Governor Bush's foreign policy views and experience will be filled by the ideologies and inveterate antipathies of his party -- the right-wing, partisan isolationism of the Republican Congressional leadership.''</p>
        <p>Now this is a legitimate question. Mr. Bush has no experience in foreign policy, the well-displayed gaps in his knowledge suggest he may not have even read the newspaper much, and this could make him easy prey for the foreign policy ideologues in his party.</p>
        <p>But in raising this question Mr. Gore, inadvertently, raises a question about himself -- a question that many people who respect him have been asking. If you talk to Al Gore about geopolitics, the Internet or the global economy, you leave feeling he really does get it. But what good are brains if you don't always act on them? Mr. Bush may not have the brains to always do the right thing, but does Mr. Gore have the spine?</p>
        <p>Most of Mr. Gore's speech was a serious appeal for an activist, internationalist U.S. foreign policy -- something that, in fairness, Mr. Bush would also pursue. So what was legitimate in Mr. Gore's critique of Mr. Bush? It's the charge that the internationalism Mr. Bush offers often sounds like a we-will-do-whatever-we-want-because-we're-the-only-superpower-and-I-am-not-a-wimp-like-Clinton set of policies, which, if adopted at once, could be destabilizing and would have virtually no allied support. The best thing you can say is that Mr. Bush doesn't really mean some of this stuff. But what if he does?</p>
        <p>What if he really is ready to unilaterally ''withdraw'' from the ABM treaty, if the Russians won't change it, and destroy the whole fabric of arms control? What if he really is ready to plunk down billions to build a dubious missile defense system against a dubious threat? What if he really is ready to launch a war to ''take out'' Saddam Hussein? What if he really is ready to expand NATO to the Russian border?</p>
        <p>If it were his father, the former president, you know that he would do the prudent thing. But we don't know that with George W., and when you look at his own party's willingness to be led around by the fringe views of Jesse Helms, well, Mr. Gore is right to ask: Is George W. his father's son or his advisers' captive?</p>
        <p>But as for Mr. Gore, in his speech he called for a foreign policy of ''forward engagement'' -- addressing problems early before they become a crisis and doing so ''as close to the source of the problem as possible.'' Well, I can think of no problem more in need of such forward engagement than the U.S. embargo of Fidel Castro's Cuba, which has failed for 40 years to oust the Cuban dictator and, if continued, is only going to ensure that when Castro dies the Cuban economy collapses, civil war breaks out and thousands of Cubans sail for Miami. Fixing that policy means engaging the hard-line Miami Cubans, who want no change in policy, but as Mr. Gore showed in the Elian case, that sort of tough love is not his thing.</p>
        <p>Elian was not a one-day story. It was one of those moments when you get to see everyone's character: Attorney General Janet Reno stood her ground. Mr. Bush said what his advisers told him to say. And Mr. Gore tried to both exploit the Elian saga for political advantage and hide from it.</p>
        <p>In his speech, Mr. Gore decried ''protectionism and isolationism,'' but when union-led demonstrators were disrupting the World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle in the name of more protectionism, Mr. Gore was silent. What good is it to be for things in principle if you won't take them on in practice? I know Mr. Gore has cast tough votes before. I know he has to get elected. But the growing trend in the Clinton years was that the campaign never ends. This administration has not given a Sister Souljah speech to anyone in a long, long time.</p>
        <p>That's why the best you can say today about Governor Bush on foreign policy is that he doesn't really mean it, and won't do the wrong thing. He'll wise up. And the best you can say about Al Gore is that he really does mean it and will do the right thing. He'll stand up. But both still have something to prove.</p>
