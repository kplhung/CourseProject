        <p>For the second time in nine months, 15 players and five alternates were named to the United States Olympic women's softball team. For the second time, 31-year-old second baseman Julie Smith was not one of them.</p>
        <p>Even though it was Smith's case that prompted a federal arbiter last week to order the Amateur Softball Association of America to select the team again using more objective criteria, the team selected yesterday is identical -- except for one alternate -- to the squad chosen last September.</p>
        <p>''It's suspect,'' Smith said yesterday of the A.S.A.'s selection. ''The gut feeling was that I was punched in the stomach. The more I thought about it, I feel like we embarrassed them so there is no way they would put me back on the team.''</p>
        <p>Smith and her lawyer, Danielle Carver, said last night that they would not appeal the A.S.A.'s second selection, although they had 24 hours to change their minds.</p>
        <p>Both focused on the positive impact of Smith's arbitration.</p>
        <p>''That's the ultimate victory,'' Smith said. ''The bottom line is that the A.S.A. from here on out will be held accountable.''</p>
        <p>Lisa Fernandez, a veteran pitcher for the United States team, was relieved the issue was settled a month before the team begins its pre-Olympic tour. ''Now we can focus on becoming a team,'' she said. But she was impressed with Smith's stand.</p>
        <p>''Finally we had an athlete who stepped up to the plate and took it head on,'' Fernandez said. Regarding the selection committee, she said: ''Now that it's over it's going to force people to make a commitment, so they can't hide behind arbitrary definitions of words -- like 'good attitude' and 'leadership.' Now it will force them to pinpoint and tell people what's what, so the process can be as objective as possible.''</p>
        <p>Amanda Scott, a 21-year-old pitcher in her senior year at Fresno State, was the new alternate added to the team, replacing a former alternate, outfielder Kelly Kretschman.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, Scott also went to arbitration to contest her originally being left off the team, believing as Smith did that it was not a performance-based decision. Although Scott did not allow a home run or an earned run in a five-day tryout last September in Midland, Mich., she lost an earlier arbitration case.</p>
        <p>The federal arbiter mandated last week that the A.S.A. choose its team primarily on the basis of the five-day tryouts last September, while still taking into account intangibles like leadership, attitude and teamwork. The team that was selected in September was based on a three-year evaluation period, in addition to the tryouts.</p>
        <p>''I'm confident we did what we were supposed to do and followed the procedure the arbiter had ordered,'' Marty McGuire, the selection committee chairman, said last night.</p>
        <p>At the tryouts, according to Carver, Smith was ranked seventh offensively out of 39 players. She had a .278 average, as compared with the .133 average of the other second baseman in the tryouts. But that other infielder was Dot Richardson, the most recognizable player from the gold-medal-winning 1996 team.</p>
        <p>''If you evaluate only on statistics, that will tell you nothing, you take a small snapshot,'' the A.S.A. executive director, Ron Radigonda, said.</p>
        <p>Smith, who was a member of the 1996 Atlanta team, was concerned that her often contentious relationship with Coach Ralph Raymond and her vocal role as an athlete's representative had been determining factors in the committee's decision. Radigonda denied that was the case.</p>
        <p>''The basis of the selection is based on the talent of players only,'' Radigonda said. ''We have some athletes who come into the system who have higher skill than others. Being on a team one year doesn't mean you need to be on it another year.''</p>
        <p>Richardson learned that lesson after the 1996 Games. The season after the United States won the inaugural gold medal and secured corporate sponsorship, she was cut, having been told she had lost a step.</p>
        <p>Richardson had played shortstop until last year when Crystl Bustos, a 21-year-old hitting phenomenon, succeeded her. Richardson rejoined the team last year, but was told she would play second base, essentially replacing Smith.</p>
        <p>Fernandez said Smith had expressed her displeasure with the situation to Raymond in front of the team. ''You could see her frustration and you wanted to push her into seeing the big picture, which was to get on the team,'' Fernandez said.</p>
        <p>That did not happen yesterday.</p>
        <p>''To end up like this, stabbed in the back and the heart, I am hurt but I am not surprised,'' Smith said. ''I believe there is something evil going on and it is even bigger than me.''</p>
