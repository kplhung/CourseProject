        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Post-dictatorship Argentina inherited a legacy similar to the one you cite for South Africa (editorial, May 1). Where an oppressive police apparatus remains in power, that apparatus continues to beget crime, even though police violence is no longer initiated by the government.</p>
        <p>The police abuses in Argentina, including torture, planting weapons and shooting ''fleeing'' suspects, were common in the United States until disadvantaged groups were able to exercise such power that coerced confession began to be thrown out of court. Such progress is difficult in places lacking the economic well-being that might allow average citizens collectively to assert their rights.</p>
        <p>Prosperity also affects police forces. When the salary of Colombia's police was raised significantly along with educational requirements for recruits, their public image changed sharply for the better.</p>
        <p>J. M. TAYLOR  Houston, May 3, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a professor of anthropology at Rice University.</p>
