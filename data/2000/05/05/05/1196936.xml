        <p>Keeping the Faith To Themselves</p>
        <p>TOM BROKAW, the anchor of ''NBC Nightly News,'' received an award yesterday that was named for WALTER CRONKITE, who used to have a similar job at CBS. And DAN RATHER, who succeeded Mr. Cronkite at ''CBS Evening News,'' was in the audience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brokaw was given the Walter Cronkite Faith and Freedom Award by the Interfaith Alliance, a nonprofit group that set out several years ago to counter the political activities of religious conservatives. Indeed, its executive director, THE REV. C. WELTON GADDY, called the alliance a ''responsible alternative to the religious right.'' Mr. Cronkite lent his name to the group in 1997, signing a fund-raising letter that called the religious right ''a radical movement.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Brokaw said that ''the place of Christian activism is diminished, frankly, in American politics.'' A minute or two later, Mr. Cronkite credited that ''to a large extent'' to the alliance.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Brokaw was careful to say that he was just reporting his observations, not expressing opinions. ''I'm not here to take sides,'' he said. ''I think I was selected for this award because I covered this all across the spectrum. No one is suggesting by my presence here that anyone is endorsing any one faith over another.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Gaddy said he did not know what Mr. Cronkite's religious beliefs are -- or Mr. Brokaw's. And they were not saying.</p>
        <p>''My own beliefs I've always kept to myself in reporting,'' Mr. Brokaw said. ''I thought Bill Bradley gave the best answer: 'Yes, practicing Christian, and that's all I'm going to say about it,' or words to that effect.''</p>
        <p>Caller ID: Yankees Fan</p>
        <p>''Chazz from the Bronx'' had had enough. He was fed up with listening to WFAN-AM, the sports station where all the callers yesterday seemed to be frustrated Mets fans saying that the Yankees were more lucky than good.</p>
        <p>''Chazz from the Bronx wants to talk about the Yankees,'' one of the hosts, RUSS SALZBERG, announced.</p>
        <p>The voice on the phone was enthusiastic. ''They're going to win it all again this year, I can feel it,'' the caller said. He cited the Yankees' comeback against the Cleveland Indians on Wednesday. ''When they were losing 5-1, I could see it in their eyes that they would come back and win.'' (They did, 6-5.)</p>
        <p>Eventually Mr. Salzberg and his co-host, STEVE SOMERS, confirmed what some listeners suspected: the caller was CHAZZ PALMINTERI, the actor and director.</p>
        <p>''Mets fans should not worry about the Yankees; they should worry about the Braves,'' Mr. Palminteri added. As for the Yankees, ''let's give them the credit they deserve.''</p>
        <p>Three Dinners For Three Tenors</p>
        <p>The three tenors were together again on Wednesday -- not singing this time, but eating and listening.</p>
        <p>The evening began with a party at PLACIDO DOMINGO'S restaurant, at 209 East 49th Street, near Third Avenue. The gathering celebrated the  second debut of the three-and-a-half-year-old restaurant, now called Placido Domingo Restaurant and Tapas Bar.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Domingo's imprimatur, the restaurant never seemed to achieve a high profile, at least as far as the cooking was concerned. Now Mr. Domingo has hired his friend PATRICIA QUINTANA, a Mexican cookbook author and consultant, as the chef. She is serious enough about the project to have moved to New York.</p>
        <p>She has put together a Mexican and Spanish menu. That may not be the first choice of LUCIANO PAVAROTTI, a connoisseur of Italian cuisine and a good cook in his own right. ''Maybe we'll put something special on the menu for him, or he might eat our green paella instead of risotto,'' Mr. Domingo said before Mr. Pavarotti and JOSE CARRERAS arrived.</p>
        <p>As for whether the party was planned because the other tenors were scheduled to be in New York on Wednesday, or whether the other tenors had come to New York just for the party, Mr. Domingo said that neither was the case. ''It was a coincidence,'' he said. ''It turned out that we were all going to Carnegie Hall to hear our friend Carlo Bergonzi sing 'Otello.' '' Sure enough, they hustled out the back door promptly at 7:45 p.m. so they could make the 8 o'clock curtain.</p>
