        <p>Anthony Carter looks anguished as he stands in the middle of a brightly lit gym, waiting for the Miami's evening practice to begin. His sleepy brown eyes move from side to side.</p>
        <p>''I'll make it short,'' said the 24-year-old point guard. ''I was a high-school dropout. My freshman year I didn't go back no more. I was out of school for three years. Went back to school and got my G.E.D.''</p>

        <p>Anthony Carter looks anguished as he stands in the middle of a brightly lit gym, waiting for the Miami's evening practice to begin. His sleepy brown eyes move from side to side.</p>
        <p>''I'll make it short,'' said the 24-year-old point guard. ''I was a high-school dropout. My freshman year I didn't go back no more. I was out of school for three years. Went back to school and got my G.E.D.''</p>
        <p>He does not stop, each detail tumbling forward, faster and faster.</p>
        <p>''Went to a junior college in California. Had two great years there. Went to the University of Hawaii. Had two great years there. Separated my shoulder before my senior season. That kind of scared everybody away. Had surgery after my senior year. Went to the C.B.A. and worked my way back up. That's it.''</p>
        <p>Carter left out the part about playing $1,000 winner-take-all, pickup games in Atlanta and how he caught Coach Pat Riley's eye and eventually borrowed Tim Hardaway's job.</p>
        <p>He may have to give it back when the Heat open its Eastern Conference semifinal series against the Knicks here on Sunday, but Carter will not raise a fuss. He is making a guaranteed wage to play pro basketball.</p>
        <p>Carter started 30 games during the regular season, averaging 6.3 points, 4.8 assists and 2.2 turnovers. In the Heat's first-round, sweep of Detroit, Carter outplayed Lindsey Hunter, whom he was buried behind in Pistons training camp last year, and averaged more than 9 points and 9 assists.</p>
        <p>Carter is not a long-distance threat like Hardaway -- he hit 3 of 23 3-point attempts all season -- but he will break down a defense, using frontlines as pylons as he maneuvers his 6-foot-2-inch, 185-pound frame with ease through the lane.</p>
        <p>Five years ago, the chances of that happening were remote.</p>
        <p>''The only thing he was on his way to was becoming a playground legend,'' said Llew Haden, who sponsored Atlanta's first 'I Have a Dream' project and who serves as a surrogate uncle to Carter. ''A. C. making it to the N.B.A. was a pretty big long shot.''</p>
        <p>The program, founded in New York, randomly selects classes of third-grade students and guides them as they grow, providing tutoring, cultural experiences, contacts with role models and money for college.</p>
        <p>Carter was one of 47 children selected in his class to participate in the program. By the time he was 15, however, Carter veered off course, a truant whose grades made him ineligible to play sports. He dropped out of high school simply because ''I didn't want to get up in the morning and walk to school.''</p>
        <p>Between the ages of 16 and 19, Carter traveled around Atlanta to hustle games. He and his friends, known as the Boys from Kirkwood, often divided the $1,000 winners' share after a game. ''It was physical and people got upset when they lost, but there were no fights,'' Carter said. ''After it was over, we just split up the money. Right there. Everybody paid up. It was a good living.''</p>
        <p>The life of a pickup basketball player seized hold of Carter, and he thought of doing little else with his life. His coach at Atlanta's Alonzo A. Crim High School still tells Carter he cost him three state championships.</p>
        <p>Beyond his quickness, his stop-and-pop game, Carter also had a large circle of unending support. He grew up with his mother, Brenda, in his grandmother's home with 13 other siblings. They often doubled as Carter's uncles and aunts.</p>
        <p>One aunt, Deborah Carter, 28, was the only member of a basketball-playing family who went to college (Georgia) and became a pro (Utah and Washington of the Women's National Basketball Association).</p>
        <p>''I was the only girl that could get into the boys' club at the time,'' she said. ''I'd take him with me to play every day. He used to get so mad when neighborhood guys would dunk on him. He was just determined to get back at them. Bottom line, he got a second chance.''</p>
        <p>Carter's life took a turn for the better on a summer night in 1994. An opponent recalled how the point guard dunked eight times in a midnight game. The player, Andre Craig, called his former coach, Bill Brummel, at Saddleback College -- a two-year junior college in Mission Viejo, Calif.</p>
        <p>Craig asked Carter if he could videotape one of his games and send it to Brummel. Relying on only grainy footage inside a dimly lit gym, Brummel offered Carter a financial aid package.</p>
        <p>But it was a mentor in Haden's ''I Have a Dream'' chapter who convinced the high-school dropout to give college a try.</p>
        <p>Mattie Baker, a project coordinator for ''I Have a Dream,'' was driving down Memorial Avenue in southeast Atlanta that summer when she noticed Carter walking down the street. He had been an on-and-off participant in the program, and she wanted to know how he was getting along.</p>
        <p>''I just stopped by the Y.M.C.A. and asked her if she could help me fill a form out so I could go back and get my G.E.D. and she helped me,'' Carter said. He also pulled out a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and showed it to her. It was an acceptance letter to Saddleback.</p>
        <p>''By the time she read it, he was supposed to be there two days already,'' Haden said. ''I called Brummel up and said, 'Do you still want him?' He said, 'Damn right! Can you get him here?' ''</p>
        <p>Two days later, Haden used money from the foundation to pay for the plane ticket to Los Angeles. A friend stuffed $200 in Carter's pocket, and he was off to college.</p>
        <p>Carter led the state in scoring in the 1995-96 season, erupting for 44 points in one game. He also earned enough credits to qualify for a Division I scholarship at the University of Hawaii. By the end of his junior year, he was considered first-round draft material in the National Basketball Association, but shoulder surgery before his senior season scared away scouts.</p>
        <p>In 1998 at the predraft camp in Chicago, where players scrimmaged at the Moody Bible Institute before hundreds of scouts, coaches and general managers, Carter re-injured his shoulder three minutes into the first scrimmage.</p>
        <p>He went undrafted and spent last season taking long bus rides with the Yakima Sun Kings of the Continental Basketball Association. He tried out with the Detroit Pistons, but asked for his release after two weeks of playing behind Hunter.</p>
        <p>Along came Riley, who saw him play for a Mavericks summer league team and plucked him away from Dallas. The deal: Carter would go to camp and they would pay his living expenses. If he made the roster on Nov. 2, the first day of the season, Riley would sign Carter to a one-year, free-agent deal worth $385,000.</p>
        <p>After Hardaway jammed his right knee in late November, Carter started 30 games, including the last four of the regular season. When Hardaway sprained his left foot in April, Carter started all three games in the first round of the playoffs against Detroit. Carter's value has rocketed and the Heat will compete with other teams for his services during the off-season.</p>
        <p>''If I didn't run into Miss Mattie Baker that day, I wouldn't be here now,'' Carter said.</p>
        <p>Carter's game comes straight from asphalt lore. On the court, he is all about taking risks and hard drives to the hole. But the package also comes with turnovers, an unreliable jump shot and a penchant for playing at hyper speed.</p>
        <p>''I feel good with him,'' Riley said. ''I feel comfortable with him. I can deal with his turnovers, because I know they're all honest. He's trying to make good plays. He's fearless.''</p>
        <p>Riley puts special intonation on ''fearless.'' Carter seems cast from the same mold of fringe players who found a home with a Riley-coached team, players who all have two things in common: big hearts and larger limitations. Anthony Mason. Xavier McDaniel. John Starks. Dan Majerle.</p>
        <p>''I loved Mase, as many problems as I had with him,'' Riley said. ''And I cried when X went to Boston,'' Riley said of McDaniel, the former Knick. ''I couldn't believe he left. Then we got Starks. Then Dan. Keith Askins. And now A. C.</p>
        <p>''These guys are cut out of the same cloth. I develop an affinity toward these kinds of men. They're great pros. They're winners.''</p>
        <p>Carter distinguished himself further by becoming that rare rookie Riley entrusted with important minutes. Hardaway's injuries and Carter's progress forced his hand.</p>
        <p>Like any rookie, the Knicks plan to trap Carter, exploit his weaknesses. The player whose income once depended on winning playground games was asked if he is feeling the pressure.</p>
        <p>''I don't feel no pressure out here playing,'' he said. ''I had a lot of pressure not going to school, when people kept telling me to go back. This isn't pressure.''</p>
        <p>Today after practice, he wore black athletic slippers and a long-sleeve black Heat jersey with red trim. Rubbing his goatee, he held a half-full bottle of a fruit-punch flavored sports drink and the keys to his custom, white sport utility vehicle in the parking lot of Palm Beach Community College, where the Heat practices.</p>
        <p>Guarded, humble, he said he is tiring of telling his story. He gives much of the credit to Haden, whom he maintains a close friendship with and who will attend Sunday's game.</p>
        <p>''He gave me money out of his own pocket to keep me going in life at times when I needed it,'' Carter said. ''Didn't matter what it was for, he wanted to help me out.''</p>
        <p>Said Haden, ''A 55-year-old white guy who's an investment banker and a 24-year-old professional athlete from the inner city aren't supposed to have a lot in common. But for all those differences, we share an awful lot with each other.''</p>
        <p>It is hard to know Carter was once competing for cash on Atlanta's sweltering blacktop, where the weeds muscled up through the asphalt and the only way you got paid was when your five beat somebody else's five.</p>
        <p>''I kind of look back on it now,'' Carter said. ''Because one of my friends down in Miami tells me he's still doing the same thing, hustling games. We were laughing about it. I was telling him, 'I don't have to do it no more.' ''</p>
