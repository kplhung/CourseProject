        <p>Bayard Webster, a former editor on the science desk of The New York Times and former Times science writer, died on Sunday at the Heron Point Retirement Community in Chestertown, Md. He was 82.</p>
        <p>The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Webster worked for The Times from 1957 until he retired in 1985; during that period he was an editor on the metropolitan desk as well as on the science desk, and a writer specializing in nature, wildlife and animal behavior.</p>
        <p>His versatility in science writing was shown by such headlines on his articles as ''Alligators in Love,'' ''Elephants Have Language Inaudible to Humans'' and ''Prehistoric Man's Killing of 90 Giant Baboons Suggests Early Ritual.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Webster was born in East Orange, N.J., attended Wesleyan University in the 1930's, became an account executive at a New York advertising agency and was a Navy pilot with the rank of lieutenant in the Pacific theater in World War II. He received the Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Medal with Silver Star.  After the war he was an editor at The Baltimore Evening Sun before working for The Times.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, the former Martha Millspaugh; two sons, Kirk and Anthony; a daughter, Jacqueline Webster Harwood; and two grandchildren.</p>
