        <p>Hit by unusually cold weather this spring, many of the nation's merchants reported yesterday that sales fell short of their goals in April.</p>

        <p>Hit by unusually cold weather this spring, many of the nation's merchants reported yesterday that sales fell short of their goals in April.</p>
        <p>On Wall Street, the disappointing kick-off to the warm-weather selling season and investor fears that consumer appetites are finally waning combined to send retail stocks lower for a second consecutive day. The Standard &amp; Poor's retail index fell 21.73, or about 2.5 percent.</p>
        <p>Sales at stores open at least a year, a crucial industry measurement, rose 7.6 percent last month, according to the Goldman Sachs retail composite index. That is a healthy number, but it does not tell the entire story. Because the important Easter selling period was in April this year, the April sales numbers were skewed upward from 1999, when the holiday was in March. The average sales gain of the two months comes to 4.5 percent, which is a solid increase but short of the pace of growth that retailers experienced last year.</p>
        <p>''If you average March and April, we are a tad bit below where we have been running all year,'' said Richard Baum, a retail analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. Mr. Baum said he thought the bad news was isolated and weather-driven rather than indicative of a larger pattern.</p>
        <p>''It seemed to be very company specific,'' he said. ''In the discount department store sector, for example, Wal-Mart and Target Stores had double-digit increases, but Kmart was flat.''</p>
        <p>Others, however, saw clouds on the horizon. On Wednesday, analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded 14 retail stocks, including top performers like Costco, Target and Wal-Mart, because of what they perceive as a weakening economic picture. ''Spending growth will slow in the second half even as cost pressure continues to build for many retailers,'' the analysts wrote. ''Within the slowing cyclical environment we envision, even outstanding companies appear unlikely to surpass dramatically current 2000 estimates.''</p>
        <p>Among the retailers that came in below sales estimates this month were Kmart, which posted a sales decline over last April of 0.8 percent; the TJX Companies, which had a sales increase of 5 percent, or 2 points below expectations; and Mervyn's, which was down 0.8 percent, instead of up 2 to 3 percent.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest disappointment was Gap Inc, which has been uncharacteristically off the mark with its fashions lately. Gap's sales grew 7 percent, well below estimates of 10 to 12 percent. Gap was particularly hurt by the performance of its Old Navy division, which had a sales increase of 4 to 6 percent instead of the 12 to 14 percent it had forecast, as its ''all-terrain'' campaign failed to catch on with women shoppers.</p>
        <p>Several companies, including Talbots, Intimate Brands and Ross Stores, exceeded their goals.</p>
