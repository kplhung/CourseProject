        <p>The body of Cardinal John O'Connor will be carried into St. Patrick's Cathedral today to lie in state, beginning four days of services and prayer vigils that will end on Monday with his burial in a crypt behind the altar.</p>
        <p>The events, five Masses, evening prayers and vigils, are expected to draw tens of thousands. But at their essence, church officials say, the rites will be very much what they would be for an average Catholic.</p>
        <p>''The burial rite of any Christian is the same, whether you're pope or cardinal or an archbishop,'' said Msgr. Ferdinando D. Berardi, who has helped to plan the cardinal's funeral.</p>
        <p>''They're much more solemn because of who he is and who is present,'' the monsignor said. ''But the prayers that are used, the rites that are used, are the same as ones used for a parishioner in the smallest church.''</p>
        <p>Still, Monsignor Berardi said, the scope of the event will be fitting for a figure who led 2.4 million Catholics. All but the funeral will be open to the public.</p>
        <p>The public mourning begins at 4 p.m. today with the rite of transfer, when the cardinal's coffin is carried into St. Patrick's, greeted with holy water and prayers and covered with a funeral pall. The service will include a homily, reflections and prayers before the coffin, placed inside the sanctuary, will be open for viewing.</p>
        <p>Mourners will find the cardinal dressed in the vestments he wore to celebrate Mass: a cassock covered by an alb, a white garment; a stole, worn around the neck; and a white robe, signifying resurrection and baptism. His head will be covered by a red skullcap and a miter, the tall hat of bishops.</p>
        <p>Dr. Richard Awn, a professor of religion at Columbia University, said Catholic services were rooted in classical traditions. ''For a cardinal, the way he is treated, in fact, reflects the old model where the pope was the head of state, a monarch, and the cardinals were understood to be princes of the church,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Yet, Dr. Awn and church officials agree, services for the cardinal will include modern and personal touches. The special guests at a 1 p.m. Mass tomorrow will be  children and disabled people. Sunday's first Mass for the cardinal, at 1 p.m., is for clergy, nuns and lay workers from the cardinal's previous pastoral affiliations.</p>
        <p>The services will end at 2 p.m. Monday with a Mass of Christian Burial, to which mourners will need tickets that are being issued by the archdiocese. Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston will be the homilist and Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the secretary of state for the Vatican, will celebrate the Mass.</p>
        <p>The service will end with ''Lift High the Cross,'' a hymn beloved by the cardinal, for it was sung when he was installed as head of the Archdiocese of New York. ''At the beginning, he was following the cross of Christ,'' Monsignor Berardi said. ''At the end, he was following the cross of Christ.''</p>
