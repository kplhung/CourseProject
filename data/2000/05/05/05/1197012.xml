        <p>BUSH VOWS FIGHT IN CALIFORNIA -- On the second of what will amount to at least four swings through California this spring, Gov. George W. Bush insisted yesterday that he was determined to fight for the state's 54 electoral votes and would not repeat the actions of the last two Republican presidential nominees, who made an early show of interest in California and then effectively ceded it toward the end of the campaign. ''I intend to campaign all the way through November here,'' Mr. Bush said in Mission Viejo, where he visited a charter school. Although Mr. Bush rarely edges up to anything resembling a criticism of his father, former President George Bush, who lost his re-election bid in 1992, the Texas governor said on Wednesday that one reason Republicans had hit hard times in California was that the party's presidential nominees in 1992 and 1996 had abandoned any hope of winning the state.</p>

        <p>READ MY LIPS: NO SMIRK -- California was not the only place where Gov. George W. Bush discussed his father's presidential campaigns. In an ABC News interview to be broadcast today, he says his father seriously undermined his credibility by breaking the ''read my lips, no new taxes'' pledge that had helped him win the White House in 1988. The Texas governor, who himself has taken a no-new-taxes pledge, says the switch helped lead to his father's defeat by Bill Clinton. As for President Clinton, Mr. Bush sharply criticizes his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky. ''He and Mrs. Clinton have done a great job with their daughter, no question about it,'' Mr. Bush says. ''But Bill Clinton, unfortunately, in the last chapter of the 20th century, embarrassed our nation.''  Mr. Bush gave Vice President Al Gore credit for being ''a loving husband and a good dad.'' But he says he is ''a little worried about a man who tends to stretch the truth in order to get ahead politically.''  And what of criticism of himself, especially the charge that he wears a habitual smirk? ''I find a great irony in life and I find humor,'' he replies. ''And I find it amazing that people would spend time analyzing whether I was smiling or not, as opposed to what my views are on education or keeping the economy strong or cutting taxes.''</p>

        <p>THE HOUSE</p>
        <p>DETERMINED TO STAY -- Representative George Nethercutt of Washington, who has been attacked repeatedly in advertisements run by the U. S. Term Limits group because he broke a pledge to serve only three terms, is countering with an advertisement aimed at the head of Term Limits, Paul Jacob. It begins by noting that Mr. Jacob is a convicted felon who served time in 1980 for draft evasion, asserts that Mr. Jacob's group is financed by rich ''secret donors'' and concludes: ''So when you see the next U. S. Term Limits ad, recognize it for what it is -- lies from convicted felons.'' In 1994, Mr. Nethercutt, a Republican, upset Speaker Tom Foley and became a hero of the term limits movement with a promise that, if elected, he would serve only six years. He faces no major Democratic opponent thus far as he seeks a fourth term, but he said on Monday that he needed his advertisements to ''fight fire with fire.''' The U.S. Term Limits response was a new advertisement stating, ''Nethercutt will say or do anything just to stay in power.''</p>
