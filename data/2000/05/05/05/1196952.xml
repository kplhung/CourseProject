      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial on new problem facing New York, Brooklyn and Queens public library systems--rapid departure of their professional librarians, who are leaving for better-paying jobs in suburbs and other cities; contends New York City has been slow to recognize value of librarians, and has failed in recent decades to bring their salaries into line with those of other municipal employees, including teachers</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The three public library systems that serve New York City are just recovering from the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, which left bookshelves empty, computer systems outdated and library buildings falling to pieces. Now the New York, Brooklyn and Queens library systems face a new problem -- the rapid departure of their professional librarians, who are leaving for better-paying jobs in the suburbs and other cities.</p>
        <p>New York's public libraries are especially crucial in poor and immigrant neighborhoods, where new citizens pour through the doors daily seeking help on everything from finding a job to getting a driver's license to learning how to read and speak English. Yet New York's librarians are among the most poorly paid in the nation. Beginning librarians, many with master's degrees, receive a starting salary of $31,000 and could reach $54,500 after 20 years. This puts New York librarians 20 to 25 percent below the average salary nationwide.</p>

        <p>New York's public libraries are especially crucial in poor and immigrant neighborhoods, where new citizens pour through the doors daily seeking help on everything from finding a job to getting a driver's license to learning how to read and speak English. Yet New York's librarians are among the most poorly paid in the nation. Beginning librarians, many with master's degrees, receive a starting salary of $31,000 and could reach $54,500 after 20 years. This puts New York librarians 20 to 25 percent below the average salary nationwide.</p>
        <p>The attrition rate among librarians in the New York system is 50 percent in the first three years. In the Bronx, 9 of the 34 libraries have no children's librarian. In the Bronx, Manhattan and Staten Island,  about 20 percent of librarian positions are vacant.</p>
        <p>The city has been slow to recognize the value of librarians and has failed in recent decades to bring their salaries into line with those of other municipal employees, including teachers. Unless the city redresses the imbalance -- and begins a recruitment drive as it has done for teachers -- the library system could find itself permanently understaffed.</p>
