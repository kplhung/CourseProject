        <p>George Adams</p>
        <p>41 West 57th Street</p>
        <p>Through May 20</p>
        <p>Born in Mexico and now living in California, Enrique Chagoya is a product of European artistic tradition, Central American folk culture and 20th-century Pop. A gifted caricaturist and mimic, he grapples with the conflicts of his own hybrid inheritance, giving expression to an irreverent, wildly pluralistic imagination.</p>
        <p>On canvas the artist layers stereotypes of New World primitivism over the ghosts of European painting. In one, naked cannibals lifted from egregiously racist pictures by Theodore Debry, a 17th-century Dutch explorer, are painted over a pale-blue copy of Manet's ''Dejeuner sur l'Herbe.'' This evokes a split in European consciousness between high-minded sophistication and the unconscious savagery it has projected onto other peoples.</p>

        <p>George Adams</p>
        <p>41 West 57th Street</p>
        <p>Through May 20</p>
        <p>Born in Mexico and now living in California, Enrique Chagoya is a product of European artistic tradition, Central American folk culture and 20th-century Pop. A gifted caricaturist and mimic, he grapples with the conflicts of his own hybrid inheritance, giving expression to an irreverent, wildly pluralistic imagination.</p>
        <p>On canvas the artist layers stereotypes of New World primitivism over the ghosts of European painting. In one, naked cannibals lifted from egregiously racist pictures by Theodore Debry, a 17th-century Dutch explorer, are painted over a pale-blue copy of Manet's ''Dejeuner sur l'Herbe.'' This evokes a split in European consciousness between high-minded sophistication and the unconscious savagery it has projected onto other peoples.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chagoya also uses the Mesoamerican codex, a horizontal scroll-like narrative format. A 10-foot-long work, ''An American Primitive in Paris,'' mixes Superman, Jesus, goofy characters from French comics, Aztec diagrams, Claude Monet eviscerated and Che Guevera with a baby's body reading a Mr. Natural comic book. This panoply of small-scale images fiercely satirizes the enduring legacy of Western elitism and imperialism.</p>
        <p>The paradox of all this, not disavowed by the artist, is that for better or worse only the continuing tradition of European modernism (or postmodernism) provides a home for the antic, self-reflexive cultural critique that Mr. Chayoga practices.</p>
