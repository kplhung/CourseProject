        <p>Days before Vladimir V. Putin's swearing-in as Russia's second president, a Moscow newspaper has published what purports to be a Kremlin proposal to use the K.G.B.'s successor agency as a weapon against political foes, journalists and others who stand in the way of ''real control'' of Russian politics and society.</p>
        <p>Among other things, the proposal speculates that the government's special services could smear opponents who have damaging information about the Kremlin leadership and gather ''special information'' about potential candidates for high office.</p>
        <p>The Kremlin has refused comment, and there was no indication whether Mr. Putin had seen the proposals.</p>
        <p>The business daily Kommersant said the plan it published, redolent of the days when Soviet internal spies monitored the politics of millions, is part of a thick book entitled ''Structure of the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation.'' It was marked ''Revision Number 6'' and ''Only for reading/Not to be copied.''</p>
        <p>Kommersant has detailed its contents in two days of articles, the most explosive one today, and plans a third on Friday.</p>
        <p>While Russia's power brokers have been known to dupe journalists before with false documents, there is no indication so far that the book is not genuine. The presidential press service refused to comment on the reports today, saying they are Kommersant's business.</p>
        <p>The newspaper's deputy editor, Cyril E. Kharatyan, said in an interview today that he has no doubts about the report's authenticity.</p>
        <p>''There may be some other documents of this kind, but this is the freshest one,'' he said. ''It is an actual working document, not a draft at all.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kharatyan said, however, that he has no idea whether the plan has reached Mr. Putin's desk.</p>
        <p>Kommersant said the plan was prepared by experts at the Kremlin, at Alexander House, the regal building that houses Mr. Putin's economic team, and at the offices of the Federal Security Service, the domestic successor to the K.G.B.</p>
        <p>Its central premise -- that reasserting the Kremlin's power in both the central government and Russia's sprawling regions is ''a strategic necessity'' -- would surprise no one. Mr. Putin has said that Russia was becoming ungovernable under the weak rule of President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>
        <p>But the newspaper claims that the planners intend not just to recoup Mr. Yeltsin's lost authority, but to bring back the central control that the Communist Party once exercised. It quotes the document as stating that the presidential administration should create a political directorate charged with gaining ''real control over political processes in Russia.''</p>
        <p>To restore order and stability, the document states, Mr. Putin ''needs a political structure as part of his administration which cannot just forecast and create required political situations in Russia, but can effect real control of political and social processes in the Russian federation as well as in the near abroad countries.''</p>
        <p>In turn, that demands ''the participation of the Federal Security Service (F.S.B.) and other special services in the activities of the political directorate,'' the document states.</p>
        <p>The F.S.B.'s present task is to ensure internal security -- to fight terrorism, foreign espionage and sedition. The Kommersant document envisions harnessing that expertise ''to achieve quick, competent and productive results required for getting the work of the directorate off the ground.'' What that means is not described in detail in the Kommersant article. But the newspaper quotes the report as offering three hypothetical examples.</p>
        <p>The first describes a ''pre-emptive political action'' against an opposition political leader who, the government learns, intends to reveal damaging facts about Kremlin leaders -- ''for example, on the purchase of property or something else.''</p>
        <p>To counter that, the report speculates, ''the directorate holds an analogous press conference a day or a few hours earlier disclosing materials on the property of the opposition leader in a negative light.''</p>
        <p>The second example envisions neutralizing an impending critical newspaper report by arranging the earlier publication of another article ''treating the facts in such a way as to make the opposition's article look irrelevant and uninteresting.''</p>
        <p>The third suggests that the political directorate be directed to gather so-called special information on ''potential candidates for president, now and in the future,'' among others.</p>
        <p>A political expert here, Vyachaslav Nikonov, said the Kommersant report was probably leaked by one faction in Mr. Putin's team to discredit its enemies.</p>
        <p>''I think it must be the reflection of some sort of internal struggle,'' said Mr. Nikonov, who heads the Moscow-based Politica foundation. In any case, he said, ''What the administration is already doing does not contradict what is in the paper.''</p>
