        <p>Just as some of the top antiques dealers are selling their spaces in Manhattan, one prominent London dealer has established a beachhead in New York.</p>
        <p>John Hobbs, a British dealer for 35 years, has a new by-appointment-only office on Park Avenue. He is working with Laura Steinberg, an Italian based in New York.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hobbs is not giving up his London gallery. His large space at 107a Pimlico Road, which he said has about $80 million worth of paintings and antiques, will not change, he said; he simply wants to spend more time in New York.</p>
        <p>''I've wanted to live in New York for five years,'' he said. ''Now that my son Rupert has come of age, he can run the shop in London with my business manager, Charles Mortimer.''</p>
        <p>Rupert Hobbs, 30, said he was pleased about the arrangement. ''Growing up, I spent all my holidays working in the shop,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In New York the elder Mr. Hobbs maintains notebooks with photographs of his wares, which range from 18th-century Italian tables and massive chimney pieces to overscale mirrors to giant marble torchiers designed by Piranesi. ''The majority are from 1740 to 1820,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His stock can also be seen on his Web site: www.johnhobbs.co.uk.</p>
        <p>It is unclear how his presence in New York will improve his business. Mr. Hobbs has many New York clients, including the socialite Mercedes Bass; Lily Safra, widow of the banker Edmond J. Safra; and the financier Henry R. Kravis. In London his customers include top decorators like John Stefanidis, Chester Jones and David Mlinaric.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless he said the United States held the key to his future, a view supported by a new study.</p>
        <p>The European Fine Art Foundation, which organizes the Maastricht art and antiques fair in the Netherlands every March, commissioned a report on the state of the European art and antiques market. The 120-page study, released in March, reported that sales in Europe totaled $7.1 billion in 1998, $1.5 billion more than in the United States during the same year.</p>
        <p>The gap, however, is closing. According to the study, the United States market grew 81 percent from 1994 to 1998, while the European market grew 26 percent during the same period. The foundation predicted that the American market would overtake the European one in a few years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hobbs clearly wants to be part of the American market. His taste is admired, but his prices are famously high. He said he recently sold a large marble sculpture of a man, carved in the 1730's by John Cheere, for $500,000.</p>
        <p>''I only buy what I want, not what is popular,'' he said. ''I get a feeling in my gut. If it takes me more than three seconds, I don't want to have it.''</p>
        <p>And he concedes that he is no scholar: ''I left school when I was 13.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hobbs's passions have changed over time. ''My first real period was Dutch 17th-century,'' he said. ''Then I went through a Russian period, a French period and an English period.''</p>
        <p>Juan Pablo Molyneux, a New York interior designer who knows Mr. Hobbs well, said: ''He breaks the mold of our idea of an English antiques dealer. He has extraordinary pieces, and a lot of them show a sense of humor.''</p>
        <p>For the last six years Mr. Hobbs has been buying northern Italian antiques from Modena, Turin, Bologna and Lucca. ''They tend to be more gutsy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He is selling two tables with antique Italian mosaic tops. ''The tops are not alike,'' he said. ''I'm guessing an Englishman bought the mosaics in Italy on the grand tour, then commissioned the oak bases when he returned to England, in about 1815.''</p>
        <p>The twin pedestal tables have have deeply carved snarling griffins on their bases. ''I don't know another pair of tables like this,'' Mr. Hobbs said. ''But then, I specialize in one-offs.''</p>
        <p>For him the problem is finding great antiques.</p>
        <p>''When I sell wonderful things, they normally don't come back on the market for another 50 years,'' he said. But he is on the hunt. His New York office can be reached at (212) 737-9195.</p>
        <p>Modernism in May</p>
        <p>Several Modernism sales are scheduled in London this month.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday Christie's has a single-owner sale titled ''Jean-Michel Frank'' featuring works by Frank (1895-1981), a famous 1920's Paris furniture designer and decorator. His furniture tended to be simple and geometric in form, but luxurious in materials. He used limed oak, vellum and shagreen, or sharkskin, for example.</p>
        <p>Jacques Grange, a French decorator, wrote about Frank in the catalog for the sale: ''Exquisite proportions, elegance of form, simplicity of line, the blend of materials, the ease and harmony of his combinations of shapes, render his work timeless. Jean-Michel Frank is unique; it is restraint and discipline that give his style its full expression.''</p>
        <p>The sale includes two large Frank cabinets. The first, veneered with bone-colored shagreen, is stamped by Frank and is estimated to sell for $120,000 to $140,000. The second, also stamped, is veneered in satinwood and its estimate is $56,000 to $79,000.</p>
        <p>The shapes are severely simple. ''Most of Frank's furniture is stripped-down Louis XVI or Empire,'' Louis Bofferding, a New York dealer, explained. ''In the end Frank was more of an interior designer than a furniture designer. The furniture may look plain, but the walls were parchment, the lamps were alabaster, and the doors were bronze. He wanted rooms to have patina and personality.''</p>
        <p>Not all the items are by Frank. There are a magnificent 1930's shagreen-and-ivory cabinet by Jules Leleu and a 207-piece Art Deco silver flatware service designed by Pierre Legrain and manufactured by Robert Linzeler and Jean Puiforcat.</p>
        <p>Legrain (1889-1929) helped create the Art Deco style in Paris and, like Frank, designed furniture in luxurious materials.</p>
        <p>Puiforcat (1897-1945) was the most important silversmith of the 1920's. He designed the silver in Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann's pathbreaking Hotel du Collectionneur, a pavilion at the Paris exposition of 1925 that gave Art Deco its name, as well as services for the Maharajah of Indore and for the ocean liner Normandie.</p>
        <p>The 1920's service has some pieces with Lucite and red Bakelite handles. Adam Chadwick, a specialist at Christie's London, said: ''It was ultra-modern in its time. Legrain is the magic name. This is a unique model in flatware.'' The estimate is $160,000 to $240,000.</p>
        <p>A second 1920's set by Puiforcat, this one for a 12-person service, is in Christie's London sale of 20th-century decorative arts the next day. Its estimate is $63,000 to $94,000. Puiforcat is still on the market and a new set of its silverware is considerably cheaper.</p>
