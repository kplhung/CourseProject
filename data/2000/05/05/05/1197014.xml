        <p>This was to be the Year of Reform at the state Capitol, when lawmakers scrubbed electoral processes of special-interest money, eliminated ''pay to play'' loopholes in the way officials invest Connecticut's pension fund, and abolished the state's chronically troubled county sheriff's system.</p>

        <p>This was to be the Year of Reform at the state Capitol, when lawmakers scrubbed electoral processes of special-interest money, eliminated ''pay to play'' loopholes in the way officials invest Connecticut's pension fund, and abolished the state's chronically troubled county sheriff's system.</p>
        <p>But in the end, whether the year was about reform was more of a highly debated opinion than a fact. The General Assembly dropped some of its biggest initiatives, passed others in forms far less ambitious than they originally intended and gave the governor a campaign finance bill he seems increasingly likely to reject.</p>
        <p>Among this year's most controversial bills to reach Gov. John G. Rowland's desk -- where it will remain until Friday morning, when the governor is expected to veto it -- is a proposal that would use public money to pay for state political campaigns and impose voluntary limits on how much candidates could spend. The bill would cap spending on a governor's race at $8 million and set limits for all 187 seats in the General Assembly.</p>
        <p>If Governor Rowland ends up killing the bill, he will likely repeat the litany of Republican criticisms of it. Republican legislators have criticized the use of public money for political purposes and denounced the spending limits, though voluntary, as too high for General Assembly races, where Democrats are a majority, and too low for a governor's race in which Governor Rowland, a Republican, is the incumbent.</p>
        <p>Today, Robert M. Ward, the Republican House minority leader who led his party's fight against the campaign finance bill, called it ''the biggest mistake'' of this session, which ended at midnight on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Governor Rowland recently signed versions of two other bills into law that, along with the campaign finance bill, had formed this year's triumvirate of reform legislation heralded by leaders of both parties.</p>
        <p>One new law tightens the rules governing how the state treasurer invests the state's $21 billion pension fund and limits who may collect a finder's fee for arranging investments of the fund. The law is a reaction to a scandal last year in which a former treasurer, Paul J. Silvester, was indicted on charges of  accepting kickbacks in exchange for investing with certain firms.</p>
        <p>Though the law closes the loophole that allowed the kickback scheme to flourish, Republicans say it is not real ''reform'' because it does not establish direct oversight of investments made by the treasurer.</p>
        <p>The other large reform issue of this year's session concerned a bipartisan effort to do away with Connecticut's 298-year-old county sheriff's system that has become, in many lawmaker's opinions, a mill of political patronage staffed by inept and undertrained deputies.</p>
        <p>But the bill the governor signed a week ago was far weaker than the bill originally proposed, which would have stripped the eight county sheriffs of their responsibilities and transferred their deputies to branches of the state government.</p>
        <p>Bowing to pressure from two powerful Democratic legislators whose sons are deputies, however, the General Assembly voted to abolish the system only if voters approve in a November ballot referendum.</p>
        <p>Reflecting on this year's session, Senator William Aniskovich, a Republican from Branford, criticized Democrats specifically for allowing amendments to the sheriff's bill that left it ''open to the vagaries of an election in November.''</p>
        <p>Democrats, however, hailed the session and its political reforms. ''Clearly, the reform agenda, the tax-cutting agenda and balancing the budget that was unanimous and bipartisan I think will be what this session is known for,'' said Kevin B. Sullivan, the Senate president pro tempore. His deputy, Senator George C. Jepsen, gloated that Governor Rowland ''bought a moderate Democratic agenda.''</p>
        <p>But not all Republicans lamented this legislative session as a missed chance at real reform. In his speech at the close of this year's session, Governor Rowland mentioned the R-word three times.</p>
        <p>''The legislative session began with a commitment to government reform, and we have kept that promise,'' he said, referring to the sheriff's bill and a bill mandating disclosure of how nonstate agencies use taxpayer money.</p>
        <p>The speech was brief and light. Unlike the speech he made to open the session on Feb. 9, Governor Rowland rather conspicuously avoided mentioning the law he signed placing new restrictions on the treasurer's office, or the campaign finance bill lying on his desk.</p>
