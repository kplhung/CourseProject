        <p>It's sweaty-palms season again on Broadway, a time when Tony nominations are announced and antacid companies rejoice. But Monday morning's announcement of the nominations may be particularly nerve-racking for some productions, as several are seeking any kind of recognition on which to peg their hopes -- and advertising campaigns.</p>
        <p>For the rest of the theater world, however, there's some delicious drama in store.</p>
        <p>The most closely watched category -- and the one with the potential for the most immediate impact -- is best musical, in which both ''Contact'' and ''James Joyce's 'The Dead' '' are considered near-certain nominees. That leaves three running shows, ''Aida,'' ''Swing!'' and ''The Wild Party,'' and one closed show, ''Marie Christine,'' all of which received mixed reviews, vying for the two remaining slots.</p>
        <p>Industry speculation is that ''The Wild Party,'' which has been playing at half-capacity, needs a best-musical nomination to survive. If it doesn't get one, the show may well post a closing notice on Monday, even if it gets some acting nominations. (See Eartha Kitt and Toni Collette.)</p>
        <p>Some industry insiders think ''Aida'' has an edge over the other two productions by dint of its Disney marketing power and its strong sales, although ''Swing!'' is seen as an audience pleaser and has also shown considerable pluck in keeping a steady stream of business coming into the St. James Theater. ''Marie Christine'' is the dark horse, having closed in January; a big serious work, it needs support from the aesthetes on the nominating committee.</p>
        <p>In the best play category, ''The Green Bird,'' Julie Taymor's take on the 18th-century commedia dell'arte by Carlo Gozzi, could use a nod to goose its sales, as could ''Waiting in the Wings'' at the Eugene O'Neill. Another possibility is ''Rose'' at the Lyceum, which may land Olympia Dukakis a nomination for acting. And judging from Patrick Stewart's passionate words of late, ''The Ride Down Mount Morgan'' needs some attention to be paid. Here again, however, several shows are not going to make the cut, as the competition includes the critical hits ''True West,'' ''Dirty Blonde'' and ''Copenhagen.''</p>
        <p>Another category to watch is best actor in a play, mainly because of the strength of competition and a new rule that allows nominators to choose five candidates in acting categories rather than the four slots in years past. Among those considered strong potential candidates, on the basis of critical reaction, name recognition or both, are Stephen Dillane (''The Real Thing''), Gabriel Byrne (''A Moon for the Misbegotten''), Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly (both of ''True West''), Philip Bosco and Michael Cumpsty (both of ''Copenhagen''), Sir Derek Jacobi (''Uncle Vanya'') and Mr. Stewart.</p>
        <p>Not everyone can fit, however, and Monday may be a particular nail-biter for ''True West,'' and ''Copenhagen,'' the two productions in which both male leads are being considered. It will also be interesting to see how Mr. Stewart fares in light of his very public debate with the Shubert Organization over the marketing of ''The Ride Down Mount Morgan.''</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, there are plenty of other, sweeter races to watch. In best actress, for example, there's the very real possibility that Rosemary Harris (''Waiting in the Wings'') and Jennifer Ehle (''The Real Thing''), mother and daughter, may be nominated in the same category. And Barnard Hughes and Helen Stenborg, husband and wife, may snag nominations in supporting categories for their work in ''Wings.''</p>
        <p>Further down the list, there are dozens of other supporting players in critical hits (like Jason Antoon in ''Contact'') and misses (like Orfeh in ''Saturday Night Fever'') who will probably have trouble sleeping Sunday night. Luckily for them, it will all be over soon enough: nominations are announced at the eye-opening hour of 8:35 a.m., live from Sardi's.</p>
        <p>Stage to Let</p>
        <p>Theater crunch? What theater crunch? That's been the question ricocheting around off Broadway as a bear market has suddenly made some prime real estate available.</p>
        <p>The most recent case is the Minetta Lane in Greenwich Village, where plans to mount ''Thunder Knockin' on the Door'' screeched to a halt after relations soured between the playwright, Keith Glover, and the producers. Elsewhere in the Village, the Lucille Lortel has been dark since ''Noel Coward's Suite in Two Keys'' closed last month.</p>
        <p>Uptown, at the Promenade on Broadway at 76th Street, among Off Broadway's most sought-after theaters, ''The Waverly Gallery'' will be gone by May 21. And in midtown, the Douglas Fairbanks Theater on West 42d Street is still looking for a tenant, though the owner, Eric Krebs, said an announcement was coming soon.</p>
        <p>Who Has Time, Luv?</p>
        <p>Since arriving in New York last month to rehearse and perform ''Yard Gal'' at MCC Theater, Amelia Lowdell and Sharon Duncan-Brewster have experienced some culture shock -- good food late at night, for one thing -- but in truth, they've really been too busy.</p>
        <p>''Yard Gal'' is a two-person show, with both onstage for the entire 90 minutes. ''It's not like you can say, 'Do Scene 5 without me,' '' said Ms. Lowdell, 28, who is on her first trip to the United States. ''We have to be there for each other.''</p>
        <p>The play, which opened on April 27, has been well received, with special praise for Ms. Lowdell and Ms. Duncan-Brewster's portrayal of two street-smart teenagers in a dangerous drug spiral, characters they created at the Royal Court Theater in London two years ago.</p>
        <p>The two, who are sharing an apartment, say they'd like to sightsee at some point. But not just yet. ''I keep thinking I'd like to get out and do something mad,'' said Ms. Duncan-Brewster, 25. ''But then I remember, I'm here to work.''</p>
        <p>Along the Way</p>
        <p>*The cast for a late May workshop of Stephen Sondheim's ''Assassins'' is an impressive one, including the pop songstress Lisa Loeb, Brian D'Arcy James and Stephen Spinella.</p>
        <p>*The Jewish Repertory Theater's season finale, ''Abie's Island Rose,'' a musical takeoff on that chestnut of American theater ''Abie's Irish Rose,'' opens on Sunday at Playhouse 91 on the Upper East Side.</p>
