        <p>Compared with the response when federal officials removed Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives' home two weeks ago, the public reaction to the removal yesterday of about 200 protesters from a United States Navy bombing range on Vieques island was muted.</p>
        <p>But among some of the elected officials and civic and religious leaders who have made Vieques their cause, there was outrage. Representative Jose E. Serrano, Democrat of the Bronx, went to the White House to have himself arrested in an effort to convince the administration that it could still negotiate an alternative to resuming Navy bombing on the island.</p>
        <p>His protest had an element of the comedic. After Mr. Serrano tried to block a van leaving the White House grounds, the van backed up, and he followed it inside the White House grounds, the gates shutting behind him. After a 10-minute standoff, Secret Service agents persuaded him to retreat outside the gates to a restricted area, where the congressman was subsequently arrested.</p>
        <p>Three other New York elected officials -- Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, Democrat of Brooklyn; Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez and Councilman Jose Rivera, both Democrats -- had traveled to Vieques hoping to prevent the arrests of the protesters, but found themselves among the arrested. They spent yesterday being transported from the Navy area by vehicles and boats.</p>
        <p>Fernando Ferrer, the borough president of the Bronx, also criticized the protesters' removal, saying, ''It only exacerbates 60 years of real environmental and social abuse on this island.''</p>
        <p>And speaking from Chicago, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has been an outspoken opponent of the bombing, called the removal of the protesters ''another vestige of colonial Caribbean politics,'' adding, ''It is gunboat diplomacy at its ugliest.''</p>
        <p>But there was no widespread protest. In New York, a tiny knot of demonstrators gathered outside St. Cecilia's Church in East Harlem, waving flags and holding protest signs and passing out flyers for what they said would be a much larger protest in midtown Manhattan this afternoon.</p>
        <p>Gloria Quinones, a founder of Todo El Barrio Con Vieques, a group formed last October to protest the bombing on the island, called the early morning operation an ''invasion'' and criticized what she called a ''major use of force'' against peaceful demonstrators.</p>
        <p>In the late afternoon about 150 people gathered outside an armed forces recruiting station on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. They marched and sang, and Councilwoman Margarita Lopez addressed the group, telling them that on this day she felt ashamed to be an elected official of the United States.</p>
        <p>And, according to a Web site that posts Vieques-related actions, protests were also held outside federal buildings in Springfield, Mass., Orlando, Fla., and elsewhere.</p>
