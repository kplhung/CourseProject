        <p>Looking to attract a younger customer, the venerable clothier Lord &amp; Taylor has named Jane T. Elfers, a 39-year-old merchant, to the top spot of president and chief executive.</p>
        <p>Ms. Elfers succeeds Marshall Hilsberg, who held the post for 13 years before he retired earlier this year. Ms. Elfers, who is currently executive vice president for Lord &amp; Taylor, with responsibility for dresses, suits, sportswear, coats and accessories, is expected to assume her new duties on June 1.</p>
        <p>Lord &amp; Taylor, a division of the May Department Stores Company, has seen its image become older and dowdier in the last decade. The division has not been performing badly, but it has not kept up with May Company's other divisions or with the most aggressive of its department store competition.</p>
        <p>Stock analysts who cover May said that while it was unlikely that Ms. Hilsberg, who has been with the company since 1989, would try radical changes at the stores, the move clearly signaled that Gene Kahn, president and chief executive of May, wants some sort of change.</p>
        <p>''Lord &amp; Taylor has been undergoing an evaluation on future positioning with a consultant and she has been in on the process,'' said Richard L. Church, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.</p>
