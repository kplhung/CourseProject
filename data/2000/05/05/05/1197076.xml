        <p>The United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Toyota Logistics Services, which unloads 150,000 cars a year in Port Newark, have signed a consent decree resolving a lawsuit charging the company with sex and race discrimination in hiring.</p>
        <p>The agreement, approved last week by Judge John W. Bissell of Federal District Court, came 10 months after the commission brought a lawsuit against the company on behalf of Sandra Burrows, a black job-seeker who charged that race and sex discrimination barred her from being hired as a driver or auto accessorizer at the service center. Under the agreement, the company agreed to broaden the pool of potential workers.</p>
