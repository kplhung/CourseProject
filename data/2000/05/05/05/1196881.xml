        <p>''Reservation X: The Power of Place'' at the National Museum of the America Indian in Lower Manhattan, is a lean, clean contemporary take on the tangled subject of what it means to be Indian in America today.</p>
        <p>Organized by the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Hull, Quebec, the show is made up of installations by seven artists, two from Canada, the others from the United States. The work, like much installation art, pulls disparate images and ideas together in the hope that they will strike sparks. Sometimes they do.</p>
        <p>The show's central metaphor is the reservation, ''the rez,'' a block of land granted by treaty or simply assigned by the government to indigenous people. There are many such territories, large and small, scattered throughout the United States and Canada. All seven artists were born on or have lived on one.</p>
        <p>Reservations have had a sad public reputation as enclaves of defeat and inertia, places to escape from, not value. The artists in ''Reservation X'' see them differently, as preserves rather than prisons, set-aside territories whose isolation has kept otherwise endangered cultures intact and viable. And the Reservation X of the title is as much an attitude or a state of mind as it is a location, a literally conservative view of the past integrated into the present.</p>
        <p>This dynamic takes its least textured form in Marianne Nicolson's ''House of Origin.'' Ms. Nicolson, a photographer, grew up in Vancouver but in 1990 returned to her mother's birthplace, a remote Kwakwaka'waka community on the coast of British Columbia. Although the settlement has been modernized, it retains a traditional ''big house'' for communal meetings, and Ms. Nicolson's piece is an abstract version of its rectangular structure.</p>
        <p>The end walls are defined by pictographic paintings of native myths, the long walls by photographs of local people and landscapes. The result has a celebratory Family of Man feel, edifying but a bit bland. In the exhibition catalog, several artists say that the audience they have in mind is their immediate community. Maybe that's the case here.</p>
        <p>Jolene Rickard's ''Blue Corn Room'' also has an architectural shape (almost every piece in the exhibition involves images of walls and boundaries), but a sharper message. The photographs in this case -- of ears of corn and hydroelectric towers -- refer to a specific event in 1958, when Ms. Rickard's people, the Tuscarora of Ontario and northern New York, had part of their farmland converted into a reservoir by a utility agency.</p>
        <p>The tribe raised a vigorous protest, but the plan went ahead. Ms. Rickard's piece, which incorporates a CD-ROM component, approaches the incident as both a real and symbolic event and includes within a collage of images referring to her grandfather, Clinton Rickard, who founded the Indian Defense League of America in 1926 to preserve Indian land treaty rights.</p>
        <p>Reservation X, the generic reservation, is the setting for ''If These Walls Could Talk'' by C. Maxx Stevens, a Seminole from Oklahoma. The piece replicates an elementary school classroom frozen in time: the clock is stopped at 2 minutes to 3, books are glued to the desks with an amberlike fixative. What is alive is the sound of voices emerging from dozens of speakers embedded in the walls. Ms. Stevens, who teaches art, taped biographical interviews with her students and friends about their lives, and their stories fill the room as a kind of collective whisper, with individual voices audible if one stands close to the walls.</p>
        <p>Not everything in the show takes wrap-around form. Mary Longman, of Plains Cree descent, offers a sculpture made from the joined root systems of two trees, one sitting on the ground, the other reaching upward. Mateo Romero, a Tewa from New Mexico, contributes a mural-size drawing based on cave paintings and compresses an Indian history from colonial intrusion to casino gambling into a few expressionistic scenes.</p>
        <p>The show's two most absorbing works, though, exploit the total-immersion potential of the installation format. One, Shelley Niro's ''Honey Moccasin,'' adapted from her film of the same name, revolves around a funky but fabulous mock-fashion show staged in a fictional reservation bar. The main action is on film: Ms. Niro, as mistress of ceremonies, introduces runway models dressed in found-material versions of ceremonial finery, including dresses stitched with candies and shirts stitched of tire rubber. The outfits were made by the artist's students, who served as models in the film, and their inventive handiwork is on display in a kind of minitheater with red velvet curtains.</p>
        <p>The piece is smart and irreverent and wears its low production values with a flair. Ms. Niro should head this way again soon.</p>
        <p>Video also plays a central role in ''Gia's Song'' by Nora Naranjo-Morse, who lives at the Santa Clara Pueblo, N.M. The piece is in two parts. One, a kind of altar, doesn't have much presence; the other, a view through a window of the corner of a tract house living room, does.</p>
        <p>The room is furnished with an easy chair facing a television on which a short film plays. It begins with archival shots of reservation adobes, then moves to 1960's scenes of their replacement by look-alike prefabs, a government project that destroyed a native tradition of communally shared domestic space. The artist details the change in a measured but impassioned voice-over. A result is a moving blend of political anger and personal regret, given the visual and aural layering peculiar to installation as a medium.</p>
        <p>In a sense the National Museum of the American Indian is itself an extended installation, though a confused and jumpy one, chopped up with vitrines, benches, partitions, texts, touch screens and so on. There's great art every step of the way, but it is difficult to see.</p>
        <p>These distractions seem particularly evident after the judicious ''Reservation X'' presentation. The show's curator, the Canadian artist and writer Gerald McMaster, also created one of the more cogent sections in the permanent galleries: a circles-within-circles arrangement of dozens of pairs of moccasins, poised as if ready to dance. Perhaps the installation of the museum's new headquarters in Washington, scheduled to open in 2002, will achieve a similar clarity and concentration. Mr. McMaster has demonstrated that it can be done.</p>
        <p>''Reservation X: The Power of Place'' is at the National Museum of the American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3888, through Aug. 20.</p>
