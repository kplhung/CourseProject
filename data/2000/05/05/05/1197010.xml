        <p>The gas masks are gone. The camouflage outfits and combat knives, the first-aid kits and how-to manuals for building underground shelters. All gone.</p>
        <p>For better or worse, that Y2K disaster thing never happened. So Dave Boser and Bill Baxter, owners of the Survival Preparedness Center on Main Street here, had no choice but to shut it down a couple of weeks ago. Now the dedicated campers and those lock-and-load militia boys from the surrounding hills of western New York will have to go elsewhere for their dehydrated fruit mix.</p>
        <p>''Before Y2K, there were so many people in the store that we couldn't take care of them,'' Mr. Baxter said Saturday, his voice echoing in the nearly empty store. The ensuing silence spoke to the dramatic drop in business after New Year's Day -- when a feared computer problem did not cast the world into darkness and the dawn of the year 2000 did not bring nuclear winter.</p>
        <p>In the corner sat size 10 cans of ''Provident Pantry'' dehydrated food -- elbow macaroni, blueberry muffins, egg whites -- that will keep for a decade. Nearby was half a case of 100-hour paraffin candles. Still taped to the wall, just above the now-empty knife case, were the business cards of recruiters for the Navy and the Marines.</p>
        <p>But the preparedness entrepreneurs have not abandoned their business. They plan to put together a catalog of their merchandise, and have hopes of selling some of the leftover inventory at cost. A Mormon church in the area has already expressed interest in their 429 cans of dehydrated food.</p>
        <p>And who knows when fear of a looming disaster might drum up some more interest? Mr. Baxter mentioned in passing the possibility of a cataclysmic event on May 5, when -- according to a futurist he respects -- an alignment of the sun and several planets will disturb the earth's axis and cause all kinds of havoc. He sounded more matter-of-fact than frightened.</p>
        <p>At the very least, the two men now have the kind of customer service experience not to be found at the Wal-Mart store just two miles down the road. They have loaded up the cars of two women known as the ''Y2K queens,'' witnessed firsthand the economic impact of prophecies, and rung up sales for skinheads from Altoona, Pa.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of smart people out there,'' Mr. Boser said, peering from under his ''Vietnam Veteran &amp; Proud of It'' hat. ''And a lot of dumb people.''</p>
        <p>Allegany is a small town of 8,500 people along New York's Southern Tier, about 60 miles south of Buffalo. It is a place where the Allegheny River beckons and the foothills lend crispness to the air, a place where students from nearby Saint Bonaventure University come to live for a while, then leave. But the farmers and the shop owners, the Dave Bosers and Bill Baxters, stay; it is their home.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boser, 49, is a machinist now, but the year he spent soldiering in Vietnam shaped his worldview; his key chain features the POW/MIA logo. Mr. Baxter, 47, works at the water treatment plant in Olean, a few miles away. They both smoke, drink beer, stay rail-thin somehow, and share an interest in the accouterments of survival preparedness.</p>
        <p>''I've always saved stuff for whatever happened,'' Mr. Boser explained. ''Storms, tornadoes, my daughter's car breaking down. And it's not just meals. It's first-aid kits, radios, packs of water, camping supplies.''</p>
        <p>By the fall of 1998, word spread among the campers, hunters and survivalists in the area that Mr. Boser and Mr. Baxter were buying supplies at various outlets, partly in anticipation of the year 2000. The two men soon found themselves putting in orders for other people. Then it struck them: they should open their own shop.</p>
        <p>Soon, a new presence had established itself among the bars, restaurants and shops of downtown Allegany. Now a visitor could conveniently pick up a St. Bonaventure mug at the Fabulous Shirtheads Co. Store, buy a tuna sandwich at the Allegany Sub Shop, and select an outfit designed for chemical warfare before leaving town.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baxter spoke with pride of the wares their store once offered. The camouflage outfits in ''United Nations, European and, of course, American'' styles were popular with local militia types, as well as with people who liked to play paintball. The combat knives sold fairly well, as did the manuals on map reading.</p>
        <p>Most of the goods were geared for everyone from casual campers to those with an abiding distrust of government. The hand-cranked radios, for example, were big sellers around Christmas. Another big hit was the dehydrated pudding, in chocolate, vanilla and banana.</p>
        <p>For more discerning consumers, specialized items were also available: your Israeli gas masks, your samurai swords. Mr. Baxter said that a doctor from Jamestown once came in to buy a bulletproof vest and a helmet; they later learned that he performed abortions.</p>
        <p>The store sold no guns or firearms accessories. ''And we never carried books that were offensive,'' Mr. Boser said. ''I mean, we'd get requests for bomb-making manuals.''</p>
        <p>Some of the area churches proved to be regular customers, particularly those concerned with prophecies of impending doom. According to Mr. Baxter, a man claiming to be a minister from Bradford, Pa., drove up in a Cadillac one day, popped the car's trunk and issued the order to ''fill 'er up'' with supplies.</p>
        <p>There were other customers claiming to belong to this militia group or that militia group. Mr. Baxter said the largest in the area hailed from rural McKean County, just over the border in Pennsylvania. Another militia is based right here in Cattaraugus County, he said. In fact, the head of the group was nice enough to drop off his business card one day.</p>
        <p>Mark Potok, the spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit organization in Birmingham, Ala., that monitors hate groups, said that a group called the Bucktail Militia used to operate out of McKean County, but that it had not been heard from since 1995. Still, he said, ''There is heavy movement activity in western Pennsylvania -- both militias and hate groups.''</p>
        <p>And Timothy McVeigh -- the man awaiting execution for the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995 that killed 168 people -- often used property he owned in Humphrey, just three miles north of here, as a shooting range. Mr. Baxter said that he met Mr. McVeigh once through a friend of a friend. ''We were more or less into the same thing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>When pushed further about his own political philosophy, Mr. Baxter said that most of the country's wealth seemed to be in the hands of a few people, and that ''Mein Kampf'' ''made a lot of sense.'' Then he added, ''My partner doesn't believe in 'Mein Kampf.' ''</p>
        <p>He was right. When asked later about Mr. Baxter's views, Mr. Boser gave an exasperated, there-goes-Bill-again kind of expression. ''Hitler was a moron,'' he said. ''He was the Antichrist.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boser went on to say that while militia types, ''hillbillies'' and people posing as Vietnam veterans -- which personally disgusts him, he said -- frequented the store, there were plenty of customers interested in nothing more than having ''just in case'' supplies on hand.</p>
        <p>As for his own philosophy, he said that '' 'We the people' has become 'We the government.' '' Over all, he said, he believes only half of what he sees and half of what he hears, and he belongs to no organization whatsoever -- ''not even the V.F.W.''</p>
        <p>The Survival Preparedness Center did a fairly brisk business in the days before the year 2000. But by late January, after the millennial rush, sales had dropped through the linoleum-tiled floor, and the partners decided that it did not pay to keep the store open.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Potok, many survival-preparedness stores were inundated with complaints and refund requests in the weeks after New Year's Day. He cited a recent letter written by a disgruntled survivalist to Media Bypass, a magazine that he said was popular among people involved in militias. The letter said, in part: ''Thanks a lot. I hope I'm not the only one who feels foolish and let down.''</p>
        <p>Judging by the advertisements of some preparedness outlets, the year 2000 craze was little more than a misunderstanding. The Web site for Captain Dave's Survival Center, in Cranberry Township, Pa., promotes a drastic markdown on gun clips and dehydrated food with the following come-on:</p>
        <p>''Now that Y2K is over, what should you be preparing for . . . A nuclear attack or accident? A hurricane or tornado? Biological warfare? Long-term power outages this summer? Terrorism? Inflation and depression? Earthquake? Fire? Unemployment or disability? Identity theft? An oppressive government?''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Baxter has not given up on the prospect of future disaster generating future business. ''According to the prophecies, New York City is going to be hit with a giant tsunami,'' he said, a vanilla-flavored cigar clenched in his teeth.</p>
        <p>But his partner, Mr. Boser, seemed to be considering more practical possibilities, such as moving the store to where most of the traffic is -- namely, near the Wal-Mart. As for the prediction of calamity on May 5, he said that while he knew some former customers were preparing for disaster, he expected it to be like any other day in Allegany.</p>
        <p>''I've got to work that day,'' he said, ''so it don't matter to me.''</p>
