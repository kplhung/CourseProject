        <p>Two influential farm-state senators today introduced a bipartisan proposal to change the recipe for gasoline for most of the cars in America in a move to end a fight over three competing interests: clean air, clean water and the ethanol lobby.</p>
        <p>The senators, with the Clinton administration and others, are seeking to undo a 10-year-old federal requirement that gasoline in polluted urban areas include oxygen, which was intended to reduce carbon monoxide emissions. The problem is that the chemical most frequently used to meet the oxygen requirement, MTBE, has polluted drinking water in California and the Northeast, and environmentalists want it banned.</p>
        <p>Although many experts say the oxygen rule does little to promote air quality, Congress has not dropped it because many lawmakers, especially those from farm states, like the other chemical used to add oxygen, ethanol, which is made from corn.</p>
        <p>Simply substituting ethanol for MTBE in congested cities where pollution is worst in the summer could raise fuel prices because the ethanol would be in short supply and would have to be hauled to the coasts from the Midwest. And it could exacerbate air pollution, because ethanol tends to evaporate easily in warm weather, causing smog. But even when the Environmental Protection Agency said this year that MTBE should be banned, it quickly bowed to political reality and added that ethanol use should be preserved.</p>
        <p>''The trick for us is to get rid of MTBE without throwing the ethanol baby out with the bath water,'' said an official of the environmental agency.</p>
        <p>Today, Tom Daschle, the South Dakota Democrat who is the Senate minority leader, and Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican who is chairman of the Agriculture Committee, introduced legislation that would eliminate the requirement for oxygen and substitute a requirement for ''renewable fuels,'' namely, ethanol. But the ethanol would be burned mostly in the farm states where it is produced, and mostly in winter, when its tendency to evaporate is not a problem.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daschle said that to maintain the existing oxygen requirement would create such enormous price increases that ethanol suppliers would become extremely unpopular. And the windfall profit would go to a handful of major producers, not farmers, he said.</p>
        <p>Carol M. Browner, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, called the bill ''a major step in the right direction.''</p>
        <p>The bill would set a floor on ethanol consumption of 1.3 percent of national gasoline supply, which is the current level, and would require increases over 10 years. But it would drop geographic quotas and time-of-year requirements.</p>
        <p>The result in the Northeast and California, in urban areas where about half the country's gasoline is sold, would probably be an end to oxygenated fuel.</p>
        <p>In the country's midsection, ethanol would become far more common, experts say.</p>
