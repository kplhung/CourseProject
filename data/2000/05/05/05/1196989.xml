        <p>The search for a permanent New York City schools chancellor has been thrown into tumult by a last-minute bid for the job by Irving S. Hamer Jr., the Manhattan member of the Board of Education.</p>
        <p>By telling the board president on Wednesday evening that he wants the job, Dr. Hamer has removed the majority vote -- his own -- for Harold O. Levy, the interim chancellor, and paralyzed a process that until now seemed destined to result in Mr. Levy's permanent selection as chancellor.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hamer has also created a competition with all the ingredients of New York City's raucous political theater: an educator against a businessman, a black against a white, with the interests of bigger players like the mayor at stake.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hamer, who is black, is a former deputy commissioner of the State Education Department who has long aspired to the chancellorship, while Mr. Levy, who is white, is on leave from his job as a manager and corporate lawyer for Citigroup.</p>
        <p>With the board effectively deadlocked, unable to muster an obvious majority for Dr. Hamer or Mr. Levy, it appeared for the first time yesterday that an outside candidate might have a chance.</p>
        <p>Confidants of Dr. Hamer said that he had become a candidate out of a sense of dissatisfaction with Mr. Levy's leadership, and some city and education officials said that wider political considerations might be involved.</p>
        <p>Until now, board members had reassured Mr. Levy that he could count on the same four votes that had supported his selection as interim chancellor in January, including Dr. Hamer's. In recent weeks, Mr. Levy, who was appointed against the wishes of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, had seemed to tighten his grip on the job with his assertive, yet diplomatic management style. Indeed, the mayor had seemed his biggest obstacle.</p>
        <p>As news of Dr. Hamer's candidacy, which was not publicly announced, seeped out of 110 Livingston Street yesterday, the initial reaction from Board of Education members and officials at City Hall was astonishment and even a hint of panic.</p>
        <p>''Wow!'' said Jerry Cammarata, the board member from Staten Island. ''I have to call my borough president on this one.''</p>
        <p>Even some of New York City's shrewdest political players were scratching their heads yesterday over the development and what it meant for New York City's complicated political scene.</p>
        <p>''This is like a chess game, and I don't know how to play,'' said the Queens borough president, Claire Shulman, whose appointee to the Board of Education, Terri Thomson, has been a supporter of Mr. Levy.</p>
        <p>With Dr. Hamer's declaration that he is interested in the job, C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, suddenly finds herself in an unaccustomed position of prominence and power.</p>
        <p>Some education officials wondered whether Ms. Fields and Mr. Giuliani might join forces to select the next chancellor. Such an alliance could provide Ms. Fields with political clout to win projects for her constituents, while giving Mr. Giuliani a rare boost from a black Democratic public official as he is running for the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>''In politics, you have strange bedfellows,'' a former City Hall official said. ''There are ways of coming to understandings. This is healthy; it opens up the agenda to negotiate with a number of people.''</p>
        <p>Ninfa Segarra, one of the mayor's two appointees, took a neutral tone. ''As a board member, I was informed yesterday that he wanted to be given consideration as a candidate,'' she said, referring to Dr. Hamer. ''I welcome his candidacy, because he is a qualified individual.''</p>
        <p>But Norman Adler, a political consultant who works for both Democrats and Republicans, said that such a strategy seemed far-fetched. ''I don't think the Lord himself could deliver black votes to Rudy Giuliani in this election,'' Mr. Adler said. ''I don't see this as a conspiracy between the mayor and Virginia. In a city without logic, that is without logic and then some.''</p>
        <p>His own view, Mr. Adler said, is that ''either Virginia Fields wanted something and Harold Levy said no, or you've got a wild bull that has broken out of the rodeo.''</p>
        <p>Karen Crowe, press secretary for Mr. Levy, said he did not want to comment on Dr. Hamer's candidacy. Dr. Hamer also declined to comment. Aides said Mr. Giuliani was not available for comment.</p>
        <p>Although Dr. Hamer voted for Mr. Levy as interim chancellor in January, his support had wavered since then, and Mr. Levy made a pilgrimage to Ms. Fields just three weeks ago to lobby for her support.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fields professed surprise yesterday at Dr. Hamer's decision to seek the job. Still, she said, she would support him.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hamer was a candidate for chancellor in the late 1980's, when Richard R. Green was selected. When Dr. Hamer was appointed to the board in July 1998, he resigned as executive vice president of Simon &amp; Schuster's secondary education group.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Levy's political allies on the board were feverishly calling both Ms. Fields and Dr. Hamer, trying to persuade them to back down. Early in the day, Mr. Thompson's aides said he would release the official list of six candidates for the chancellor's job yesterday. But as the struggle over Dr. Hamer's candidacy continued, no list was offered.</p>
        <p>The collapse of the chancellor search is potentially embarrassing to William C. Thompson Jr., the president of the Board of Education. Mr. Thompson is a strong supporter of Mr. Levy, and is hoping to keep peace on the board because he plans to run for city comptroller, touting his record on education.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson did not return telephone calls for comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fields confirmed yesterday that she, too, had been urged to run for comptroller and even for mayor, but she denied that she was maneuvering to undermine Mr. Thompson's candidacy.</p>
        <p>Some political analysts said that the Giuliani administration would rather keep Mr. Levy, who has been independent but not combative, at the head of the school system than go with Dr. Hamer, whose liberal views are likely to clash with the mayor's.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hamer is barred from voting for himself or any other candidate as long as he is a candidate, state officials said. To participate in the vote, said Chris Carpenter, a spokesman for the State Education Department, would create a financial conflict of interest for Dr. Hamer.</p>
