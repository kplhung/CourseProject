        <p>The death of Cardinal John O'Connor, archbishop of New York, makes it increasingly likely that other church leaders will become more visible and influential nationally, helping fill a vacuum left by the passing of one of the most dominant figures in the American church.</p>
        <p>Two men to watch in particular, say some authorities on the Roman Catholic Church, are the archbishops of Chicago and Los Angeles, Cardinal Francis George and Cardinal Roger Mahony, respectively.</p>
        <p>The church in which their influence (and that of others) will be felt is different from what it was in 1984, when Cardinal O'Connor was appointed to New York. Major demographic trends -- the arrival of new immigrants from Latin America and Asia and the coming of age of a generation of men and women whose sense of being Catholic is often less defined than their parents' -- pose fresh and daunting challenges.</p>
        <p>When Cardinal O'Connor was appointed, American Catholics were still caught up in questions that arose in the 1960's, amid the Second Vatican Council's reforms and thereafter. Liberals and conservatives squared off over Rome's rejection of the use of birth control and such questions as how much authority women should have in the church. These days, the issues seem more complicated, less open to ideological in-fighting.</p>
        <p>Cardinal O'Connor bridged these two periods when he was appointed, immediately establishing himself as the Vatican's point man in America on moral issues, and increasingly becoming known for supporting the rights of immigrants and improved relations between Catholics and Jews.</p>
        <p>Of the major concerns now facing the church, said Chester Gillis, associate professor of theology and Catholic studies at Georgetown University in Washington and author of ''Roman Catholicism in America'' (Columbia, 1999), the continuing decline in the number of priests ''is an immediate, practical concern,'' because it threatens to reduce Catholics' access to church sacraments and pastoral care.</p>
        <p>Another challenge lies in how younger members relate to their faith. The ''young generation is extremely, poignantly concerned with their own welfare, in terms of success,'' he said, ''and that energy certainly distracts them from certain elements of the Gospel about self-sacrifice.''</p>
        <p>In all these challenges, Professor Gillis said, ''Catholic identity is at stake, in some ways.''</p>
        <p>With Cardinal O'Connor's death, some see the strongest voices in the church likely to emerge in Catholic strongholds in the Midwest and California -- at least until New York's next archbishop begins to establish himself in a pulpit that remains potentially commanding, thanks to its location in a multiethnic city of such commercial and political importance.</p>
        <p>''People in the church will be looking to Chicago and Los Angeles for leadership now that Cardinal O'Connor is gone,'' said the Rev. Thomas Reese, editor of America, a Jesuit magazine. ''Both of these cardinals are very intelligent and hard-working.''</p>
        <p>A somewhat similar opinion was offered by R. Scott Appleby, director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism at the University of Notre Dame. ''I think Cardinal Mahony of Los Angeles is already a national leader in the Catholic church and will grow in stature over the years,'' he said. ''He's pastoring a multicultural church.</p>
        <p>''Los Angeles is a microcosm of what's going on around the American church in general,'' Professor Appleby said, adding that Cardinal Mahony ''has been a very effective leader at fostering this unity in diversity.''</p>
        <p>Professor Appleby said that Cardinal George ''certainly has the intellect'' and the support of Pope John Paul II to be a national leader. But others said it was still not certain whether he could wield the kind of influence among his fellow prelates that Cardinal O'Connor did.</p>
        <p>Cardinal Mahony is probably better known, because he has been in his position longer, building strong ties among fellow bishops. Appointed archbishop in 1985, he was named a cardinal six years later and presides over a jurisdiction of four million parishioners, the largest Catholic population in any American diocese. He is known as a strong proponent of social justice, and is particularly outspoken on behalf of the rights of immigrants.</p>
        <p>Cardinal George was installed only three years ago in Chicago, where he succeeded the late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, a leader among fellow bishops. He has won regard for his intellectual abilities (he holds two doctorates) and has also been outspoken on social issues.</p>
        <p>Last month, on the anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, Cardinal George, along with other Illinois bishops, released a pastoral letter urging Catholics to eschew any form of racism.</p>
        <p>He has also been a strong critic of the death penalty. That issue is one ''where the Catholic bishops want very strongly to weigh in,'' said the Rev. Joseph Koterski, a professor of ethics and medieval philosophy at Fordham University in New York. Father Koterski credited Cardinal George as being ''very much in the mold of John Paul II.''</p>
        <p>Father Koterski -- who said he also regarded the conservative archbishop of Denver, Charles J. Chaput, as increasingly important nationally -- said a particular challenge for the church was helping parishioners in large, fast-growing parishes in the suburbs to maintain a sense of Catholic identity.</p>
        <p>But new leadership for all these problems may not necessarily come from the top, some say.</p>
        <p>''Leadership does not always have to be from the hierarchy,'' said the Rev. Gerald R. Blaszczak, a professor of New Testament and early church history at Fordham. As an example, he cited Dorothy Day, a pacifist and advocate of the poor who founded the Catholic Worker movement in the 1930's.</p>
        <p>''This has always been the case in the church,'' Father Blaszczak said. ''Maybe we're going to see leadership coming from unexpected places.''</p>
