        <p>After a roller-coaster two weeks that saw a harsh crackdown on reformists, many Iranians have settled into a watchful uncertainty.</p>
        <p>The 16 reform publications shut by judges remain silent, and trials continue of intellectuals. The suspense is now focused on what other means the guardians of the rigid Islamic government may use to try to trim the power of younger forces pushing for a more open democracy.</p>
        <p>It is a battle of wills not only in the conservative-dominated courts, but also behind the scenes between moderate clerics like President Mohammad Khatami and the conservative mullahs who surround him in the leadership.</p>
        <p>''In the short term, it's very dangerous,'' a pro-democracy reform leader, Ebrahim Yazdi, said. ''We are telling everybody to keep quiet and keep calm. We have to give the conservatives time to swallow the bitter pill of their defeat.''</p>
        <p>Two months ago, a coalition of reformers who want the clerics to be more accountable to the public won a substantial victory in elections for the 290-seat Parliament. On Friday, voters in the provinces will go to the polls again to fill 66 seats where no clear winners emerged in the first round.</p>
        <p>Reformers who are backing Mr. Khatami predict that their candidates will again sweep the voting, leaving them with a majority of 70 percent in the Parliament that is supposed to open in three weeks.</p>
        <p>Reform leaders have speculated that the size of the victory, which surprised even their strategists, came to be seen by the conservatives as an existential threat. The hard-liners' fear of a reformist Parliament seemed to coalesce with simmering anger at the reform press, which has stridently criticized leading conservatives and the anti-vice vigilante groups that the conservative clerics control.</p>
        <p>A result, the reformers said, was intense pressure on Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, who is obligated by his position as the ultimate political and religious authority in Iran to represent the clerical establishment.</p>
        <p>The general shutdown of the reform press, many believe, was approved by Ayatollah Khamenei, apparently in the hope of calling a timeout in the increasingly vicious battle that was waged in the papers after the elections.</p>
        <p>Few political figures apparently want to believe that the conservatives would go beyond a temporary shutdown of the independent papers and magazines, manipulating the election results or forcing the reform movement to accept their candidate, former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, to be the powerful speaker of Parliament. A more drastic measure like blocking the opening of Parliament, for example, could risk a dangerous backlash.</p>
        <p>''If they did that, it would be like you deciding to shoot me and then putting your head next to mine and firing into your own ear,'' said Abbas Abdi, a writer and reform leader.</p>
        <p>Iran has little experience with an internal opposition that does not aim to topple the entire system. Those who questioned the shahs' policies were executed as enemies of the state. In the first years after the revolution, those who questioned the new Islamic form of government were executed as counterrevolutionaries.</p>
        <p>Conservative clerics have fallen back on the same way of looking at their opponents, issuing a blanket condemnation of reformers as enemies of the system and foreign agents bent on destroying its very foundations.</p>
        <p>''They say, 'The system is what we say it is, the revolution is what we say it is, Islam is whatever we say it is,' '' Mr. Abdi said. ''They say that people like us, with a different understanding, are outside the system.''</p>
        <p>Many reform leaders, he maintained, have excellent Islamic revolutionary credentials. Mr. Abdi, although he was jailed for seven years under Mr. Rafsanjani, is a prime example. He led the students who seized the United States Embassy here and held American diplomats hostage.</p>
        <p>''What we are saying,'' Mr. Abdi said, ''is that we have a right to our own analysis of the system, the revolution and Islam, and that the final judgment is up to the people.''</p>
        <p>Conservative leaders, however, have seized on the more incendiary statements of well-known liberals on moral and religious issues as proof that the reform movement is merely a cover for counterrevolutionaries who want to create a secular state.</p>
        <p>''The noises right now around the closure of newspapers and all that is coming from one source, a group of young intellectuals,'' said Mohammad Javad Larijani, a prominent conservative who lost his Parliament seat in the voting in February. ''They started to doubt the rationale of our system. 'Why not separate Islam from government?' they said. 'Why not change the constitution?'  The main confrontation started from this point.''</p>
        <p>In the days since the bulk of the reform press was ordered to close, a number of reform leaders have taken a less alarmist and more sanguine view of the crackdown. They said they expected the closings to be reversed eventually. Even the ultraconservative Tehran Times said today that two of the biggest reform newspapers might be allowed to publish soon.</p>
