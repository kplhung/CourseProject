        <p>Millions of faithful admirers and staunch foes from years of inspiration and controversy yesterday marked the passing of Cardinal John O'Connor, America's most influential Roman Catholic leader, with quiet prayers, thoughtful evaluations and tributes from across the region and around the world.</p>
        <p>From St. Patrick's Cathedral to the Vatican, from City Hall and the White House to hundreds of churches, schools and hospitals of the Archdiocese of New York, there was an avalanche of praise for the 80-year-old cardinal, who died at his Manhattan home on Wednesday night after an eight-month struggle with brain cancer.</p>
        <p>Much of it was in the lofty locutions of politicians and national leaders of the Catholic Church and other religions, organized labor and those in positions of power or privilege. But some of it came from ordinary people who recalled his 16-year tenure as an unwavering spokesman for Catholic doctrines and as a compassionate advocate for the homeless, the poor, the sick and working people.</p>
        <p>But there were also criticisms -- tempered perhaps by the silent authority of the dead -- that sought to evaluate a powerful churchman who had been outspoken in his opposition to abortion and homosexuality, who had had stormy contretemps with gays and those who opposed his views against contraception and on the role of women in the church.</p>
        <p>On the first of five solemn days leading to a funeral on Monday, church officials scheduled daily masses and public viewings of the cardinal's body at the cathedral, an ailing Pope John Paul II named the Vatican Secretary of State to represent him at the funeral, and the long-awaited papal selection of a successor to Cardinal O'Connor was expected soon, stirring much speculation.</p>
        <p>It was a day of mourning, and of almost ethereal beauty. At the cathedral on Fifth Avenue, votive candles flickered in the shadows, flowers were banked and a river of people streamed in the great doors. They settled on their knees in nave and transept and before the crypt where the cardinal will be interred alongside his predecessors on Monday.</p>
        <p>Some told their rosaries under the Florentine light of the stained glass. Some wept silently, ashen-faced and heads bowed. Some were regulars at the morning masses, others had gone out of their way to pay a visit to the cathedral. Afterward, a few spoke of the cardinal and of themselves.</p>
        <p>''I just got off the train on my way to work, and I wanted to stop by,'' said Roslyn Rawls, a paralegal from Connecticut. ''I can't say I agreed with his positions'' -- she mentioned abortion and his role in the military -- ''but I think what's important about him is that he had a strong voice, a big voice.''</p>
        <p>Nelson Ponce, 43, a United Parcel driver who veered from his route to go to the cathedral and pray for the cardinal, said: ''He was such a great person, not just for the church people, but for the whole city. I feel like I owe him so much. Spiritually, I feel there's a gaping hole in our hearts now.''</p>
        <p>While voices of sorrow were common, some said the cardinal's death was a kind of blessing because his months' of suffering had ended. ''I don't consider today sad because he accomplished what he set out to accomplish, and he's gone on to a better life,'' said Chuck Costello, 45, an elevator repairman.</p>
        <p>At the Catholic Center on First Avenue, the headquarters of the archdiocese, workers who saw the cardinal regularly recalled him not as a world leader but as a friendly boss who had time for a bantering chat or a kindly remark.</p>
        <p>Munir Hamlani, who works a security detail with C.J. Brown, said the cardinal seemed to know everyone on a first-name basis. ''He'd come in and he'd say 'Hi C.J. Hi Munir,' '' Mr. Hamlani said. ''He was a very pleasant, very nice person. Everybody here feels the same as I do, I believe.''</p>
        <p>Praise and sympathy for the cardinal were not, however, universal sentiments. In Westchester County, interviews at Holy Innocents Roman Catholic Church in Pleasantville and at St. Agnes Hospital and Children's Rehabilitation Center in White Plains showed hints of mourning, and a few almost perfunctory expressions of regret at his death, but no upwelling of emotions.</p>
        <p>At the Church of the Resurrection in Rye, the Rev. Jack Arlotta, the associate pastor, said there had been no outpouring of grief. ''Most people knew he had been very sick a long time,'' he said. ''They were sad, but not in shock.''</p>
        <p>At St. Cecilia's Roman Catholic Church on East 106th Street in East Harlem, Sister Regina Burns, who has been counseling and feeding people with AIDS for 12 years in a program that receives federal and private funds but no church support, said Cardinal O'Connor had been of little help to her ministry.</p>
        <p>''Two years ago on the 125th anniversary of our church, Cardinal O'Connor came here for mass,'' she said. ''He included in his talk the fact that we have an AIDS ministry. He was very happy and proud that we are ministering to people with H.I.V./AIDS.'' But, she added: ''I would like to have seen him dialogue more with our homosexual community.''</p>
        <p>At the ethnically diverse, all-male St. Regis High School on the Upper East Side, interviews with students suggested that the cardinal was not the leader they looked to in their religious lives, and that the Catholic Church of the future will be more inclusive and less conservative.</p>
        <p>''He kicked gay people out of a parish and threatened excommunication for public leaders who backed abortion,'' said Lawrence David, 16. ''As teenagers, we've grown up in a very different world, so it's hard to identify with someone who had views like that.''</p>
        <p>The cardinal's relationship with Jews was remembered as one that evolved -- and improved -- over the years. Even before arriving in New York in 1984, he had upset many Jews by declaring that abortion in America was ''precisely the same'' as the murder of six million Jews by the Nazis.</p>
        <p>He eventually dropped the Holocaust allusion and some Jewish leaders came to see him as an opponent of anti-Semitism. He was praised yesterday by Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, as ''stalwart in his support for the Jewish community.''</p>
        <p>Israel's Foreign Minister, David Levy, paid tribute to the cardinal in a communique. ''Israel and the Jewish people have lost a true friend, a man of great moral and spiritual strength,'' Mr. Levy said. ''Cardinal O'Connor worked for many years to bring together the Jewish people and the Roman Catholic Church.''</p>
        <p>Praise for the cardinal came from President Clinton, Gov. George E. Pataki, the Rev. Billy Graham, the presidential rivals Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore, the Senate rivals Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and many others. In general they were much the same, with phrases about the cardinal's ''eloquent voice,'' and ''courage, selflessness and devotion to duty.''</p>
        <p>Pope John Paul II praised the cardinal and said he would send Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican Secretary of State, to represent him at the funeral at 2 p.m. on Monday. But there was no word on a successor to head the diocese that embraces 2.37 million Catholics in 10 counties with 413 parishes and hundreds of schools, hospitals and other institutions.</p>
