        <p>America Online and Time Warner announced their blueprint yesterday for how they will run their merged media company.</p>
        <p>The companies propose separating the creation of content, like music, books and movies, from the distribution of content over broadcast networks, cable television systems and the Internet.

        <p>America Online and Time Warner announced their blueprint yesterday for how they will run their merged media company.</p>
        <p>The companies propose separating the creation of content, like music, books and movies, from the distribution of content over broadcast networks, cable television systems and the Internet. In dividing the company along these lines, the new AOL Time Warner may be addressing the criticism that it will be so big in so many media that it has the potential to choke off other voices.</p>
        <p>The companies also said that the new structure was meant to emphasize the role of advertising, which it expects to be its fastest-growing source of revenue, even though advertising makes up only 20 percent of their $33 billion in combined 1999 sales.</p>
        <p>They also said the merged company would establish its headquarters in New York, where Time Warner has been based, rather than in Dulles, Va., the home of AOL. At the time the merger was announced in January, the companies said they would maintain dual headquarters.</p>
        <p>When the merger was announced, the companies said that Stephen M. Case, AOL's chief executive, would be chairman of the new company and that Gerald M. Levin, the chief executive of Time Warner, would be chief executive of the new company. They also said that Robert W. Pittman, AOL's president, and Richard D. Parsons, Time Warner's president, would be co-chief operating officers. The announcement yesterday detailed how Mr. Pittman and Mr. Parsons would divide the operating units of the new company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pittman will have responsibility for all of the businesses that derive income from subscriptions and from advertising. These include all of what is at AOL, the Time Inc. magazine unit, Time Warner Cable, Turner Broadcasting, Home Box Office and the WB network.</p>
        <p>Mr. Parsons will oversee business units that include Warner Music Group; Warner Trade Publishing, its book unit; and the Warner Brothers and New Line Cinema movie studios.</p>
        <p>''We want to organize in a non-traditional way to take advantage of the load of talent in the company,'' Mr. Levin said yesterday. As an example, he said: ''The magazines and AOL share more similarity than you might think. They both have subscription and advertising. So we decided to put them together.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pittman, in fact, is charged with coordinating common functions, like marketing and advertising sales among the units he looks after. But the company decided not to revamp its existing units radically, say by creating a single advertising sales organization to serve the print, broadcast and online units.</p>
        <p>All of the executives who had run the various operating units remain in place, with the exception that Barry Schuler, who had run the America Online service, now becomes the head of the entire AOL organization, including CompuServe, Netscape and other online units.</p>
        <p>Another way to look at the organization, Mr. Levin said, is that Mr. Parsons will look after what are in effect wholesale business, and Mr. Pittman will have retail operations.  ''The creative content serves consumers but is sold through distribution,'' he said. ''The platforms, from AOL to cable, have a direct relationship with consumers.''</p>
        <p>One of the most surprising aspects of this structure, analysts said, is that the new company will not combine Warner Music with America Online's units that create Winamp and Spinner, popular software for listening to music from the Internet.</p>
        <p>''We need to invent a digital music business that will work with all the studios, so that will be in Pittman's area,'' Mr. Levin said. ''The Warner Music company discovers new acts and distributes them. Dick's Warner music will deal with Bob's digital music platform and other companies' platforms, too.''</p>
        <p>The issue of how the combined company will deal with the links between its creation and distribution arms came to the fore earlier this week when Time Warner Cable stopped broadcasting ABC stations for a day and a half. The Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, argued that the new AOL Time Warner would have too much power to be a gatekeeper for creative content in most every medium.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Levin argued that Time Warner had long run its various units independently and that the new structure would make such a separation even more clear.</p>
        <p>''I don't accept the notion of a gatekeeper,'' Mr. Levin said. ''We buy programs from everybody for HBO and WB. This comes from years in the business. You need the creative impact of lots of people. If you have a captive source of supply, it will wither and die.''</p>
        <p>For now, Time Warner's Internet activities, including efforts to build a financial service within the magazine unit, a news service based in CNN and an entertainment service in Warner Brothers, will remain in those organizations but will be coordinated by Mr. Pittman.</p>
        <p>Analysts and Time Warner insiders said that there was little in the organization that was a surprise, although the announcement was sooner than many expected.</p>
        <p>The new plan will increase the scope of Mr. Pittman's role substantially and give a modest increase in operational responsibilities to Mr. Parsons, as well, who directly supervised only Warner Music and Warner Brothers at Time Warner.</p>
        <p>Ted Turner, Time Warner's vice chairman, who had supervised Turner Broadcasting, including the Cable News Network and New Line, will have no operational responsibilities in the new company. He will remain a vice chairman and gain the title of special adviser.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin also said that until the new headquarters Time Warner has been building in Columbus Circle was ready in 2004, the company would use the Time Life building on the Avenue of the Americas as its headquarters.</p>
