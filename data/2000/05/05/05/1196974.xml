        <p>Prosecutors announced today that they would seek the death penalty for Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, the Muslim cleric formerly known as H. Rap Brown, who is charged in the March 16 killing of a sheriff's deputy.</p>
        <p>The decision, announced by the Fulton County district attorney, Paul Howard, at a brief hearing today, sets up what is likely to be one of Atlanta's most politically charged capital murder trials in recent memory.

        <p>Prosecutors announced today that they would seek the death penalty for Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, the Muslim cleric formerly known as H. Rap Brown, who is charged in the March 16 killing of a sheriff's deputy.</p>
        <p>The decision, announced by the Fulton County district attorney, Paul Howard, at a brief hearing today, sets up what is likely to be one of Atlanta's most politically charged capital murder trials in recent memory. The death penalty, which is usually sought in cases involving the murder of a law enforcement officer, puts in motion a series of pretrial procedures that could put off the trial until late this year or early next.</p>
        <p>Mr. Al-Amin's legal team, with the support of many of Atlanta's Muslims, has already contended that there was a broad governmental conspiracy to frame the defendant, stretching back to his days as a radical political activist in the 1960's.</p>
        <p>The lawyers have challenged as tainted the physical evidence linking Mr. Al-Amin to the guns that police technicians say were used to kill the deputy, Ricky Kinchen, and say organized crime collaborated with the government to set up Mr. Al-Amin because he tried to end prostitution in his Atlanta neighborhood.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Al-Amin's lawyers bring up the 1960's, Mr. Howard's prosecutors may well try to cite Mr. Al-Amin's radical past as evidence of a penchant toward violence, citing his inflammatory statements as an honorary member of the Black Panther party and as a leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, as well as his 1971 conviction for armed robbery after a shootout with New York City police. Working against them will be Mr. Al-Amin's 25 years of apparent nonviolence after he moved to Atlanta, founded a mosque and began working to rid his neighborhood of crime.</p>
        <p>Today's hearing was Mr. Al-Amin's first appearance in a Fulton County courtroom since he was extradited on April 21 from Alabama, where he was captured on March 20 in the small town of White Hall.</p>
        <p>He is held under heavy security at the jail in neighboring Cobb County, which had issued a warrant for his arrest in January on charges of driving a stolen car and impersonating an officer. It was that warrant that Deputy Kinchen and his colleague in the Fulton County sheriff's office, Aldranon English, were trying to serve on Mr. Al-Amin when they were shot at point-blank range a block from his house. Mr. Kinchen died the next day; Mr. English, who was wounded, later identified Mr. Al-Amin as the man who fired an assault rifle at the deputies.</p>
        <p>F.B.I. agents said they found an assault rifle and a 9 millimeter handgun near the field where Mr. Al-Amin was captured; police ballistics experts later said the guns matched the bullets found in the two deputies.</p>
        <p>These kinds of disclosures have infuriated the defense lawyers, who say they reduce Mr. Al-Amin's chances of a fair trial in Atlanta. At their request, and with the consent of the prosecution, Judge Stephanie B. Manis of Fulton County Superior Court entered an order today restricting lawyers, witnesses and experts on either side of the case from speaking publicly about it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Al-Amin, 56, wearing a white shirt with a high banded collar and tinted glasses, did not appear surprised when Mr. Howard announced his decision and handed a copy of the request to the defense table. He listened attentively to the proceedings, and before and after the hearing chatted amiably with several of his Muslim supporters, who packed the courtroom.</p>
