        <p>Nearly a year after James E. Oesterreicher vowed to turn around the troubled department store giant J. C. Penney, he announced yesterday that he would retire as chairman and chief executive earlier than expected and without fulfilling his promise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oesterreicher, 58, who has been with the company since 1964, said Penney had started a search for his replacement and that he would stay until a successor was named.</p>
        <p>He said that his decision to step down almost a year before Penney required was in part based on the fact that several high-profile chief executive searches are under way in the retail sector -- including one for a chief executive to replace Arthur Martinez at Sears, Roebuck. In this brutally competitive environment, he said he did not want Penney to miss out on top talent.</p>
        <p>Of course, Mr. Oesterreicher has also felt pressure from investors to move along because Penney's has continued to post dismal sales, as customers desert its stores for more hip and better-priced competitors like Kohl's and Old Navy. Since he took the helm in 1997, Penney's stock has lost 66 percent of its market value. Last May at the annual shareholders' meeting, he predicted that sales would pick up; they have not. Sales at stores open at least a year have fallen for all but 6 of the last 23 months, according to Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
        <p>Wall Street cheered the news of his departure. The stock rose 8 percent, up $1.5625, to $17.4375, on a day when the Dow Jones industrials fell 67.64 points. ''The company has clearly underperformed expectations in recent years and an infusion of new blood is likely to be regarded as positive by the Street,'' said George Strachan, a Goldman, Sachs analyst.</p>
        <p>Analysts also expressed optimism because they said Mr. Oesterreicher's eventual retirement was one of a series of changes that indicated the company was serious about righting its course. Since last year, Mr. Oesterreicher has made many moves to bolster the share price and to refocus Penney on its core retailing business. Last fall, he sold Penney's credit card business, and just recently the company announced it would consider selling its direct marketing arm as well. A year ago, the company created a tracking stock for its fast-growing Eckerd's Drug Store division.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Oesterreicher broke with Penney's tradition of promoting people to top jobs solely from within. He hired Vanessa Castagna, executive vice president for merchandising and chief operating officer, from Wal-Mart Stores six months ago. Ms. Castagna is credited with having helped Wal-Mart turn its women's apparel business from a poorly assorted afterthought to a powerful market force. Although new in her job, Ms. Castagna is thought to be among the contenders to replace Mr. Oesterreicher.</p>
        <p>''The announcement today is continued evidence of change at Penney, and therefore is being seen from a positive standpoint,'' said Jeff Feiner, a Lehman Brothers analyst.</p>
        <p>Penney said it would consider candidates from outside the company as well as within. ''This would be the first time that our company has considered external candidates,'' Mr. Oesterreicher said.</p>
