        <p>Sometimes the most engrossing television is also the hardest to watch, and that is certainly the case with ''Well-Founded Fear,'' which opens a new season of the ''P.O.V.'' series on PBS tonight. The two-hour documentary by Shari Robertson and Michael Camerini takes an amazingly unflinching look at the process for seeking political asylum in the United States. The viewer who sticks with it ends up rewarded but deeply rattled, on several levels.</p>
        <p>The filmmakers managed to get permission from the Immigration and Naturalization Service to record the secretive hearings at which the fates of asylum seekers are decided, and they have fleshed out those vignettes with interviews of both the applicants and the hearing officers. The mix of emotions at play is dramatic. The strength of this film is that it is largely left to speak for itself, and that requires work on the viewer's part.</p>

        <p>Sometimes the most engrossing television is also the hardest to watch, and that is certainly the case with ''Well-Founded Fear,'' which opens a new season of the ''P.O.V.'' series on PBS tonight. The two-hour documentary by Shari Robertson and Michael Camerini takes an amazingly unflinching look at the process for seeking political asylum in the United States. The viewer who sticks with it ends up rewarded but deeply rattled, on several levels.</p>
        <p>The filmmakers managed to get permission from the Immigration and Naturalization Service to record the secretive hearings at which the fates of asylum seekers are decided, and they have fleshed out those vignettes with interviews of both the applicants and the hearing officers. The mix of emotions at play is dramatic. The strength of this film is that it is largely left to speak for itself, and that requires work on the viewer's part.</p>
        <p>From a sheer technical standpoint the film is not one that can be watched casually, while paying the bills or whatever. It jumps abruptly from case to case, and when the asylum seekers talk, there are subtitles (to show the often alarming contrast between what they said and what the translators tell the hearing officers they said).</p>
        <p>But what truly makes this a difficult film is the discomfort and dismay it makes the viewer feel. Hearing the asylum seekers' tales of woe is only one part of this, though a big part. Throw a dart at a map of the world, it seems, and there is an excellent chance of hitting a spot where people are arrested, persecuted, abused for scant reason: Algeria, Romania, China, Sudan.</p>
        <p>''Americans take everything for granted,'' one asylum seeker says. ''They have no clue what's out there.'' This is wrong, of course; Americans know full well the beauty of the freedoms they enjoy. But even the most attuned American will be distressed anew at this stark reminder of how so many others live.</p>
        <p>The most gripping part of ''Well-Founded Fear,'' though, is not the tales of the applicants but the portraits of those who have to decide whether those stories are true and whether they merit asylum. The hearing officers here speak with rare candor. They know how imperfect, almost random, the process is, and how their own prejudices affect it.</p>
        <p>They talk about how they are more likely to approve an applicant who is  well educated, about how they sometimes have to resist the impulse to hug the person across the table. They talk about how when they started on the job all of the stories sounded true, but now none do.</p>
        <p>''Well-Founded Fear'' leaves us wanting to know more about these heroic and, it sometimes seems, heartless people: How are they recruited and trained? How do they adjust to drab domestic life after such a wrenching day? It also leaves us wondering about the asylum process: what finally lands applicants in the hearing office, when some have been living comfortably in this country for years?</p>
        <p>Mostly, though, this film leaves us sighing at the great disconnect that we see so often between high ideals and one-on-one reality. The ideal of dignified care for the terminally ill comes down to finding people willing to change bedpans. The ideal of feeding the hungry comes down to people willing to work soup lines. And the ideal of having the United States be a place of refuge comes down to a snap judgment in a hearing room, based on fuzzy stories told across a language barrier.</p>
        <p>''They stay fuzzy forever,'' one hearing officer says, ''and we still have to make a decision based on fuzziness.''</p>
