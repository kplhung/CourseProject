        <p>About 204,000 gun sales were rejected after background checks of the buyers in 1999, the Justice Department said in a report issued over the weekend.</p>
        <p>That was a rejection rate of 2.4 percent of the 8.6 million gun sale applications submitted under federal, state and local laws. The laws bar the sale of firearms for various reasons, including felony conviction or indictment, fugitive status, court restraining orders, mental illness and misdemeanor domestic violence convictions.</p>
        <p>The report, issued by the department's Bureau of Justice Statistics, found that the rejection rate was higher at the state and local level than at the federal. The reason, it said, was that the state and local police departments ''have access to more detailed criminal history records than the F.B.I.''</p>
        <p>Twenty-six states, which encompass more than two-thirds of the country's population, perform their own background checks. The other states rely on the F.B.I. for the checks. Of the 8.6 million checks last year, the F.B.I. conducted 4.5 million, and state and local agencies performed 4.1 million.</p>
        <p>The rejection rate for the state and local background checks was 3 percent, compared with 1.8 percent at the federal level. The Clinton administration has argued that the states are better equipped than the F.B.I. to perform background checks, but some states have not wanted to pay the costs.</p>
        <p>Eric Holder, the deputy attorney general, said the rejections were part of the effort mandated under the Brady Law to keep guns out of the hands of ''felons, fugitives, domestic abusers and other persons not legally allowed to have a gun.''</p>
        <p>The law is named for James S. Brady, the press secretary to President Ronald Reagan who was gravely wounded in an assassination attempt on Mr. Reagan in 1981 by a man later found to be mentally ill.</p>
        <p>''Despite our success,'' Mr. Holder said, ''we must not become complacent. There are still 89 Americans, including 12 young people, dying every day from gunshot wounds. We must continue our efforts to prevent crime and gun violence and our tough enforcement strategies at the federal, state and local level.''</p>
        <p>The Justice Department said that background checks had resulted in the rejection of 536,000 gun sales, out of 22.2 million applications, since the Brady law was passed in 1994 until the end of 1999.</p>
        <p>Of the 123,000 rejections by state and local authorities last year, 73 percent were caused by felony convictions or indictments and 11 percent by domestic violence convictions or restraining orders.</p>
        <p>The national rejection rate has remained 2.4 percent since 1994, despite the Nov. 30, 1998, switch to computerized instant checks and the addition of checks on long-gun purchasers. Only handgun buyers were checked before.</p>
        <p>Representative Carolyn McCarthy, Democrat of New York, who was elected as a gun control advocate after her husband was killed and her son was severely wounded in the Long Island Rail Road shooting in 1993, said tonight that more money should be put into the background checks. ''This is another reason that we should close the gun show loophole,'' Ms. McCarthy said.</p>
        <p>Opponents of gun control have blocked efforts to enlarge the background checks to include purchases at gun shows. With Vice President Al Gore casting the tie-breaking vote, the Senate voted in 1999 to include gun shows, but the House deleted the requirement.</p>
        <p>A symbolic measure, a resolution that does not have the force of law, was approved by the Senate last month in a 50-to-49 vote, urging that all sellers at gun shows be required to conduct checks on buyers.</p>
        <p>Ms. McCarthy said that the 2.4 percent rejection rate showed that ''ordinary, law-abiding citizens can get a gun'' and that the rate would be no different at gun shows.</p>
