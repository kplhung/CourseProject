        <p>In ''An American Daughter'' Christine Lahti plays Lyssa Dent Hughes, a prominent Washington doctor who has been nominated to be surgeon general. During what is supposed to be a friendly television interview, Lyssa's husband mentions the time his busy wife failed to respond to a jury summons. The interview transforms Lyssa into a celebrity of sorts, a media target. Everything about her -- her hair, her manner, the things she has said about her mother -- become ammunition to be used against her.</p>
        <p>Wendy Wasserstein, who wrote tonight's script, based on her Broadway play, was inspired by real events: the failure of Zoe Baird's nomination for attorney general, because she didn't pay taxes on her nanny's salary; Kimba M. Wood's stymied nomination for the job, also because of nanny problems; even Lani Guinier, whose nomination for assistant attorney general was beset by politics, not personal problems.</p>
        <p>''I was interested in what happens to the best and brightest people in this country and why they don't go into public office,'' Ms. Wasserstein said in a publicity handout. ''What's more important: that they're good at public relations or that they're good at their jobs?''</p>
        <p>Sounds meaty. So it is curious, at least in this Lifetime production, that Lyssa appears almost entirely as mother, wife, friend -- oh, yes, and beleaguered nominee. She is always taking something out of the refrigerator or putting something in or cleaning up or shopping at Safeway. She doesn't even seem to have domestic help, though she and her family live in a huge Georgetown home that is unnaturally tidy.</p>
        <p>It's a relief, near the end, when she finally shows up at the hospital she is supposed to be running and dons a white doctor's coat (or maybe it's a relief because the setting recalls better television moments for Ms. Lahti, when she was a regular on ''Chicago Hope.'')</p>
        <p>The characters are cartoonish. Lyssa's nemesis is Quincy Quince (Blake Lindsley), a sleek young postfeminist writer of the Naomi Wolf school. Lyssa's best friend is Dr. Judith Kaufman (Lynne Thigpen), a Jewish oncologist (and, it seems, Ms. Wasserstein's alter ego, except for being black): Judith is always dieting, feeling like a failure despite her success, a single woman in her 40's pursuing fertility options. Lyssa's husband (Tom Skerritt) is a sociology professor who has given many private tutorials to his female students (including slinky Quincy).</p>
        <p>Certainly Ms. Wasserstein knows how to write a funny scene, but the speechifying overwhelms the satire. ''You think my wife is one of those 1970's good girls who came into prominence in the 1990's and schedules a half-hour a day for spontaneity?'' asks husband Walter, thematically.</p>
        <p>Perhaps as a subtle, feminist gesture Ms. Wasserstein has handed the philandering husband more than his share of doozies. ''We're really smart people, Lyssa,'' he says. ''We deserve to get everything out of life the really smart ones get.'' But Lyssa doesn't have the sense to look at him and say: ''Do any of us deserve anything, Walter?'' She doesn't say this -- or anything like it -- because Ms. Wasserstein seems to believe that privilege should beget privilege.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lahti rises to the occasion when she is given one. Though Ms. Wasserstein wants us to empathize with Lyssa's plight, she does not really seem to like her own creation very much. When Lyssa finally decides to defend herself on television, she ends up whining.</p>
        <p>''A woman from good schools and a good family,'' Lyssa tells the women of America archly. ''That woman has to be made to publicly suffer so we know she's real.'' She continues, ''If she refuses to compensate for her achievements, then she deserves to be hung out to dry.''</p>
        <p>Now that's a talk-back-to-the-television moment. ''Clam up, Lyssa,'' you might feel compelled to say. It isn't that poor little rich girls can't be sympathetic. But they can't be self-righteous at the same time.</p>
