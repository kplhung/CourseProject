        <p>This may someday be viewed as the game that killed interleague play. Oh, it will be tough to commit that deed, as justifiable and as merciful as it may be, as long as Bud Selig is baseball commissioner. On the other hand, if Selig had been at Shea Stadium yesterday and watched the Mets be humiliated by the worst team in the major leagues, he might have different thoughts.</p>
        <p>For all of the potential excitement of a Mets-Yankees series, there is a game like the one at Shea, where 43,610 fans, including many innocent, impressionable youngsters, were subjected to a horror show that in movie theaters would have been rated R, if not NC-17, and on television would have carried a warning for viewers to watch at their discretion.</p>
        <p>The only surprise was that the team creating most of the viewer-discretion material was the one that is supposed to be good, not the team it played, the one with the worst record in major league baseball, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.</p>
        <p>Bobby J. Jones, perhaps the most critical member of the Mets' starting rotation, was the primary perpetrator, but he had help, a lot of it, from his friends, though with friends like these, who needs enemies?</p>
        <p>In the second inning, Jones gave up home runs on consecutive pitches to two players who had not previously hit a home run this season. One, in fact, Esteban Yan, the Devil Rays' starting pitcher, had never batted in 10 years as a professional and hit his home run on the first pitch he had ever seen at that end of the 60 feet 6 inches between the mound and home plate.</p>
        <p>In the sixth inning, Jones walked two batters in loading the bases and setting the stage for his departure and a five-run flurry that turned the game in the Devil Rays' favor.</p>
        <p>In the sixth inning, Kurt Abbott and Robin Ventura, the men who man the left side of the Mets' infield, squandered opportunities to get double plays, adding agony to the five-run flurry.</p>
        <p>In the eighth inning, Rich Rodriguez hit two batters sandwiched around an Abbott error, loading the bases and leading to another five-run outburst, Bubba Trammell delivering the coup de grace with a pinch-hit three-run home run against Rodriguez.</p>
        <p>Now the defending World Series champion Yankees and the perennial National League champion Atlanta Braves did not play two sparklers Saturday and yesterday, and teams have inflicted any number of awful intraleague games on the paying public. But if the commissioner and his colleagues are going to try to sell interleague games other than the obvious matchups, they are going to have to come up with something better than yesterday's game at Shea.</p>
        <p>And if the Mets are going to wind up in playoff games in October, they are going to have to come up with someone better than Jones for their starting rotation.</p>
        <p>''Since he's been back, he's had some real strong innings,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said, grasping for something positive to say about Jones.</p>
        <p>Since he returned from a monthlong stay on the disabled list because of a strained calf muscle, Jones has started four games, emerging with one victory, one loss, two no-decisions and a 7.59 earned run average. That E.R.A. beats the 16.20 he concocted in his three preinjury starts, but it is nothing to boast about.</p>
        <p>A member of the Devil Rays said Jones had nothing yesterday, noting that he struggled to get on top of the ball and suggesting that the right-hander will have little chance for success if he continues pitching that way. He said Jones looked as if he was pitching hurt. Valentine said that with 100 or so games left, Jones has time to get it together. ''I'm confident he'll get it back,'' the manager said.</p>
        <p>But consider the record of the pitcher in whom the Mets have placed their faith. Three years ago almost to the day, Jones gained his 10th victory in his 12th start of the 1997 season, reaching a double-digit victory total faster than any Mets pitcher before him, faster than Tom Seaver, faster than Dwight Gooden, faster than Jerry Koosman, David Cone, Frank Viola. Since then, however, Jones has compiled an 18-21 record.</p>
        <p>Warming up yesterday, Jones said, he had ''probably the best fastball I've had this year.'' In the second inning, he threw a fastball on a  1-2 count to Felix Martinez, and the Devil Rays' new shortstop hit the ball over the right-field fence for two runs. Jones threw a fastball on his next pitch, too, and the opposing pitcher, in his maiden stance at the plate, hit the ball over the left-field fence.</p>
        <p>''Martinez's home run was missed location,'' Jones said. ''I tried to go fastball in and left it out over the plate. The pitch to Yan, he hadn't had a bat before. You try to make a good pitch. Anyone with a bat in their hands is dangerous. I knew when he hit it that it was gone.''</p>
        <p>The day only deteriorated from there.</p>
        <p>Baseball officials have not completed next season's schedule. They can still change their minds and abandon interleague play. Sure, the Mets and the Yankees create anticipation and excitement, but if the Mets are going to play the way they did yesterday, let the National League's woeful members, the Phillies, for example, benefit. Charity begins at home.</p>
