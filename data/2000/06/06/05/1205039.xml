        <p>The University of Maryland Baltimore County has grown dramatically since it opened 34 years ago in a former cow pasture not far from downtown. The fledgling campus has become the anchor of a science and technology corridor and offers an undergraduate science program that is widely admired at the National Science Foundation and other important scientific institutions. Last year, for example, U.M.B.C. ranked fourth, in a tie with Yale, for the number of undergraduate biochemistry degrees awarded.</p>
        <p>But the scientific community is particularly excited about the university's success in turning out black scientists, at a time when African- Americans in cutting-edge science programs are exceedingly rare. U.M.B.C.'s Meyerhoff scholarship program routinely sends black science students to postgraduate programs at elite universities. In the first seven years of the program, 84 percent of the students went on to postgraduate study, most of them pursuing Ph.D.'s or medical degrees.</p>
        <p>The scholarship program was conceived and financed by the Maryland philanthropists Robert and Jane Meyerhoff in 1988 to help African-American students pursue careers in science and engineering. The program has since been opened to all high-achieving high school seniors, and has enrolled 481 students, about 80 percent of whom are black. The Meyerhoff effort is guided by U.M.B.C.'s energetic 49-year-old president, Dr. Freeman Hrabowski, an African-American mathematician who has become widely known for his advocacy of programs directed at high achievers in the black community.</p>
        <p>The director of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Rita Colwell, recently hailed the Meyerhoff program as a model that ''needs to be replicated all over the United States.'' The curriculum should be easy to copy. But what drives the program is Dr. Hrabowski's ceaseless proselytizing and his contagious belief that every student he recruits is capable of excellence.</p>
        <p>At many colleges, the expectation of mediocrity has become the order of the day for minority students, and students respond accordingly. During the 1990's, for example, the dropout rate for black college students was 20 to 25 percent higher than that of whites. Among students who finish college, black students average two-thirds of a grade lower than whites. The achievement gap is troubling because it often persists even when blacks and whites arrive at college with similar S.A.T. scores and levels of preparation</p>
        <p>Black students suffer great anxiety, fearing white professors are judging them unfairly for racial reasons, or because they sense that these professors do not respect them intellectually. This leads them to underperform. The Stanford University psychologist Claude Steele recently described in The Atlantic Monthly how race-based stereotypes hurt student performance.</p>
        <p>Black students in Dr. Steele's studies did poorly on tests when experimenters intimated that the students would be judged on the basis of race. This ''stereotype threat'' proved especially damaging to black high achievers, who were accustomed to getting good grades and performing well on tests before arriving at college. These students worried that failure would confirm negative stereotypes. The tension they experienced precluded the relaxed, open concentration that is necessary for maximum academic performance.  But these tensions subsided when the subjects were put at ease and believed they were being judged fairly, even when the judgments were harsh.</p>
        <p>In the Meyerhoff program, young men and women get to know one another during a special summer semester before the regular school year and live in the same dormitory once school begins. The program stresses group study, so that the students learn to conceptualize complicated problems collectively, as teams of scientists do. Studying in groups also dispels cultural stereotypes that the students have about one another. Meyerhoff students are coveted as research assistants, and are quickly exposed to opportunities that lead to internships and to having research published in the leading science journals.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hrabowski says the program succeeds because it creates the expectation of excellence and that excellence begets excellence as years go on. But walk through a room on campus with Mr. Hrabowski and you feel something else at play as well. He is a tireless academic cheerleader and seems to know every student's name. As a black university president who is also a mathematician, he cuts against well-established stereotypes and demonstrates to minority students in particular that they, too, can perform at the highest levels of science. Dr. Hrabowski's optimism about student ability seems to permeate the faculty.</p>
        <p>To recreate U.M.B.C.'s success, universities will need to think about more than curriculum. They will need to filter out damaging preconceptions connected to race that dominate the culture as a whole -- and subscribe to Freeman Hrabowski's gospel of academic achievement.</p>
