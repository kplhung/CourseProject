        <p>An 18-year-old robbery suspect fleeing a police cruiser was killed early yesterday when the car he was driving hit a tree in a Brooklyn park and burst into flames, the police said.</p>
        <p>Before the fire got out of control, the police were able to pull out two other suspects, who were arrested, said Lt. Dennis Cirillo, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>The man who died, Umbert Mardonado, and the other suspects  robbed three men at gunpoint at Norwood Avenue and Fulton Street in Brooklyn about 2:20 a.m. and drove off, Lieutenant Cirillo said.</p>
        <p>The police took the victims to find the robbers, and within a mile, the victims pointed out a black 1987 Buick, Lieutenant Cirillo said. When the officers made a U-turn, the Buick sped off, he said. The police chased the Buick onto Highland Boulevard, where the car apparently could not negotiate a bend in the road. As the officers rounded the bend they saw that the car had crashed, Lieutenant Cirillo said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mardonado was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
        <p>The surviving suspects, Giovanni Porrata, 24, and Jose Vega, 24, were charged with robbery and weapons possession. They were both in stable condition at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center last night, Lieutenant Cirillo said. The officers suffered minor burns, he said.</p>
        <p>While it was not clear how fast the officers drove as they chased the Buick, Lieutenant Cirillo said it appeared that they had stayed within Police Department guidelines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mardonado's girlfriend, Irene Texaira, 15, said Mr. Mardonado and the two other men had been at her house on Saturday night and the two had urged him to go out with them. He resisted, but left with them around 10 p.m., she said. She said she assumed that he had gone out ''to get some munchies. He said, 'I'll be back.' That was the last time I ever saw him.''</p>
