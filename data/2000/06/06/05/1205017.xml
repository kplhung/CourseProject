        <p>Sweet things can grow in the rocky soil of southern Lebanon. Before the civil wars that raked the people from the land and the Israeli occupation that drove a wedge between those who remained, its terraced farms once yielded a bounty of plump cherries, grapes and apricots.</p>
        <p>Little but enmity and wild roses have been cultivated since in villages like Kafr Shuba, a jumble of houses atop a steep hill where a brisk wind always blows. Now this swath of liberated Lebanon, bombed and conquered and then governed until late May by the South Lebanon Army, an Israeli-backed militia, is reaping the bitter harvest.</p>
        <p>Across the nine-mile-deep border strip that Israel maintained as a military buffer zone for 22 years, every village and town has its tales of divided families and estranged neighbors, of a household that made its accommodation to the occupation while the one next door persisted in stubborn resistance.</p>
        <p>Take Ali Komra, a lean, sun-weathered former police officer of 52. He lost his younger brother during those unhappy years -- first to the ranks of the South Lebanon Army, which Mr. Komra considered a bunch of mercenary traitors, and then to a roadside bomb planted by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in its guerrilla war against Israel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Komra, a retiree living in a home he rebuilt over the rubble left from an Israeli bombing raid in 1970, said he had begged his brother to run away from the $500-a-month paycheck offered by the Israelis. But the younger man shrugged aside the appeals -- and Mr. Komra finally turned his back on him.</p>
        <p>Even after the Hezbollah bomb ripped his brother apart on a deserted road in 1993, Mr. Komra refused to bend. Repelled at the thought of rubbing shoulders with his dead brother's commanders, he broke every convention of his village culture and refused to attend the funeral.</p>
        <p>''I do regret it,'' he said, while inspecting a tiny field of wheat and barley that he has tried to revive in a small valley outside the village, just behind the Israeli border. ''After all, he was my brother. But I couldn't go. The way I felt, who I was, I just couldn't.''</p>
        <p>This part of southern Lebanon near the border has been a battleground for years. In the 1970's Palestinian guerrillas used its rugged landscape for attacks on Israel and provoked devastating reprisals against the villages that sheltered them.</p>
        <p>Then came the retribution from Lebanese Christian militias in the south that allied themselves with Israel to overpower the majority Muslim and Druse population.</p>
        <p>Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and 1982. When the main body of Israeli troops withdrew in 1985, they held on to the buffer zone. To administer the area and protect the border from attacks by Hezbollah and others, Israel set up the South Lebanon Army as a formal civil administration and security structure.</p>
        <p>By the time the Israelis and about 6,000 men from that group and their families scrambled out of the zone recently, the South Lebanon Army had evolved from a right-wing Christian militia to a more representative organization.</p>
        <p>Its top commander, Antoine Lahd, was a Maronite Christian. But like southern Lebanon as a whole, it eventually had more Shiite Muslims than Christians in its ranks. In areas populated by the Druse sect or, like Kafr Shuba, by Sunni Muslims, it recruited from those groups.</p>
        <p>The Israeli occupation was enforced against Lebanese by Lebanese, and over the years it corroded social relations.</p>
        <p>''There was no more trust left,'' said Muhammad Ahmed Hassan, a retired Lebanese Army officer who lives in Kafr Shuba. ''On the surface we would say all the nice things, the traditional things, but they were just words. Underneath there was nothing anymore. We drew away from each other.''</p>
        <p>South Lebanese Army security men lived in the same neighborhoods, perhaps attended the same schools, as men and women they imprisoned without trial. Contacts with members of the group could not be avoided. It not only patrolled the so-called security zone, but also collected utility bills, operated phone networks and decided who received the coveted passes to travel in and out of the zone.</p>
        <p>Every so often, its command would send out a demand for more foot soldiers. Lists would be drawn up by the local officers who knew the villagers. Bonuses were given for new conscripts.</p>
        <p>With southern Lebanon's economy devastated by war and isolation from the rest of the country, steady work with the Israeli-backed militia was sometimes more attractive than abstract nationalistic ideals.</p>
        <p>Financial desperation led Nazem Adel Alayin to join the group as a foot soldier about six years ago, said his wife, Afifi Adri. He had five children to support -- the couple has nine now -- but no land to cultivate and no job. Then came the order to present himself to officers at the South Lebanon Army post in the nearby city of Hasbeya.</p>
        <p>''They said, 'You have to work with us; we need you and we can help you with money,' '' Mrs. Adri recalled. ''At first he didn't tell me what it was all about. He just came home and stormed around and acted angry.</p>
        <p>''The second time they called him in, they told him he could either join or he could go to jail or he could leave -- those were his only choices. So he thought about things, and the third time they asked him, he said yes.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Adri has been anxiously making the rounds of her neighbors in Kafr Shuba lately, effusively congratulating them on the end of the Israeli occupation and professing joy that the group's reign is over.</p>
        <p>''There was never friction here,'' she insisted. ''In this village people are very understanding. My children were never harassed.''</p>
        <p>But there are scars that may not heal so easily.</p>
        <p>''We were afraid of the Lahd people,'' admitted Talal George Khalil, 42, a school principal from the Christian village of Rasheiye, a few miles from Kafr Shuba. ''We knew them because they were from around the area. And when I would run into one of them, I would smile and I would say: 'How are you? Have a coffee. Sit down with me. How are you doing?' Just because I was afraid.''</p>
        <p>His fawning did not protect him. He was imprisoned in one of the musty crowded cells in the jail at Khiam seven months ago -- as two his brothers had been before him -- and was there when his third child, a daughter, was born.</p>
        <p>He said he had not been told why he had been detained, but speculated that it was simply because South Lebanon Army officials suspected, rightly, that he was in favor of the armed militias fighting the Israeli occupation.</p>
        <p>He was freed, with another 145 prisoners, by Khiam residents on the day of the Israeli withdrawal.</p>
        <p>It was, in the end, the petty cruelties that came with the South Lebanon Army's petty power over other Lebanese that are remembered with the deepest anger. For three years, Mr. Hassan said, he was not permitted to travel outside the security zone.</p>
        <p>He could not say goodbye to a brother who died in a Beirut hospital. His wife could not attend her father's funeral. Their son was imprisoned, losing his chance to attend a military academy in Beirut, in another attempt to put pressure on the father.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hassan's wife, who has only one kidney, had a heart attack, then a breakdown under the stress, and she was at last allowed to go outside the zone for treatment. There, she could also do what Mr. Hassan could not: attend the wedding of their daughter.</p>
        <p>''The mother of the bride always has to be happy and has to dance for her daughter,'' said Mr. Hassan, beginning to weep as he recalled what happened. ''All she could do was walk once around the hall and leave.</p>
        <p>''But when she came back here, they immediately called her to the Lahd headquarters, and they said, 'Whatever happens to you, we will never give you another pass. If you are so ill, why were you dancing at your daughter's wedding?' ''</p>
