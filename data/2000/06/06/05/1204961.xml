        <p>For those of us who remember a time before pimply dot-com billionaires and Gatesian wealth, the recent passing of Saul Steinberg's longtime investment company, Reliance Group Holdings, marks the end of an era.</p>
        <p>Weighted down by debt, Mr. Steinberg sold Reliance to a competitor, the Leucadia National Corporation, for pennies on the dollar.

The 80's, an era when financial alchemy brought jaw-dropping wealth to a generation of Wall Streeters, can now be safely said to be over.</p>

        <p>For those of us who remember a time before pimply dot-com billionaires and Gatesian wealth, the recent passing of Saul Steinberg's longtime investment company, Reliance Group Holdings, marks the end of an era.</p>
        <p>Weighted down by debt, Mr. Steinberg sold Reliance to a competitor, the Leucadia National Corporation, for pennies on the dollar. Sold as well was Mr. Steinberg's palatial Park Avenue apartment, thought to be the largest in Manhattan, as well as its contents, including many of the fine paintings and draperies that once hung on its walls. And, let's not forget, a multimillion-dollar commode made of rococo-gilded bronze. The 80's, an era when financial alchemy brought jaw-dropping wealth to a generation of Wall Streeters, can now be safely said to be over.</p>
        <p>For the last 15 years or so, Mr. Steinberg was an oversized symbol of a decade whose legacy will forever be debated by economists and historians.  In fact, Mr. Steinberg's reputation was built largely through his groundbreaking but failed attempt to take over Chemical Bank in 1969, a precursor to 80's-style corporate raids. That run enshrined him in Wall Street lore, vividly illustrating to a generation of hungry young men what could be accomplished with a modest amount of cash and a large dose of moxie.</p>
        <p>But in the 1980's, aside from collecting $60 million in greenmail, which Disney paid him to go away in 1984, Mr. Steinberg mostly stayed on the sidelines, watching as corporate raiders like Carl Icahn, T. Boone Pickens and Ron Perelman engaged in a financial fox hunt that sent hundreds of American companies scurrying for the woods, baying investment bankers on their heels.</p>
        <p>It was what Mr. Steinberg did with his wealth that so aptly capsulized the era. It wasn't just the apartment, once owned by John D. Rockefeller, with its scarlet-and-gold dining room and seven-figure tchotchkes. His third wife, Gayfryd, was conspicuously young. His parties were legend: For his 50th birthday party in 1989, models were dressed as figures in Old Masters paintings. You get the picture.</p>
        <p>His sad fate could be taken as yet another lesson on the hollow nature of 1980's wealth, especially when compared to the wealth of the 1990's. This new era has brought a good deal of speculative excess, of course, as is the nature of Wall Street -- raw capitalism is not pretty. But whatever one thinks of the current excesses in stock valuations, it's undeniable that the latest billionaires actually helped build something -- in this case the Internet and all its attendant new technology.</p>
        <p>The same can't be said for the 1980's. The billions of dollars made from corporate raids and leveraged buyouts (in an L.B.O., a public company's shareholders are bought out using the company itself as collateral) were about nothing more than paper shuffling. When companies were cracked open like piggy banks, or split up like pizzas to reduce the debt, was anyone really surprised the parts were worth more than the whole?</p>
        <p>In these exercises, no breakthrough products were created, no Edisons were uncovered. Is there some gee-whiz product out there that Mr. Steinberg's insurance company engineered? I doubt it. From the very first such deals, there was a sense it was all a shell game, that there was something patently wrong about wealth created by tearing apart companies rather than building them up, by firing, or downsizing, workers rather than hiring them.</p>
        <p>Yet even the harshest critics of corporate raids would probably acknowledge that at the dawn of the 1980's too many American companies were overstuffed, overperked and none too sympathetic to the desires of their shareholders. Put aside all the envy, all the sniping about gold-plated cabinetry, and Mr. Steinberg and his ilk were agents of change, pure and simple. They were wolves clearing out the stragglers, forcing the other animals to get into fighting trim. True, they inflicted a great deal of pain, but financial Darwinism has never been for the squeamish.</p>
        <p>For those who handle such unpleasant tasks, there is a classic American arc. In 1982, at the beginning of the raider era, the men who launched hostile takeover attempts were lauded as American folk heroes. When they first took to the floors of annual meetings, Gordon Gekko-style, to attack the bloated old boys' networks that ran too many large companies, people actually cheered. While Mr. Pickens and others stormed the ramparts, Henry Kravis and other buyout artists, were standing by in boardrooms, ''rescuing'' the raiders' frightened prey by taking them private with velvet gloves.</p>
        <p>Of course the raiders finally went too far. In 1988, the unseemly free-for-all for control of RJR Nabisco triggered a backlash that killed the golden goose. Afterward it got ugly, as these things usually do, with a barrage of insider-trading and securities-fraud indictments and prison sentences for the untoward and the unlucky.</p>
        <p>But many of the raiders, Mr. Steinberg included, now had publicly owned companies tucked under their arms to manage, and it's been informative to see how many of them proved unable to follow through on the promises they made at those bygone annual meetings. Mr. Pickens was unceremoniously ousted from control of his company, the former Mesa Petroleum, in a shareholder uprising. Mr. Perelman's company, Revlon, is a stock-market laggard. Mr. Steinberg's Reliance Group flirted with bankruptcy for years before the last air finally eased from its balloon.</p>
        <p>The intriguing question is to what degree the winnowing and strengthening of the 80's set the stage for the explosive growth of the 90's. It's a matter best left to economists, but one suspects it is no accident that a slew of large non-Internet companies, from Wal-Mart to Gillette -- itself a target of hungry raiders during the 1980's -- embarked on rapid growth and stock-price rises in the 1990's. Would they have done so had raiders like Mr. Steinberg not frightened them into shaping up?</p>
        <p>It would be the richest irony to argue that Saul Steinberg begat Bill Gates. I won't. But one should also not reach the facile conclusion that Mr. Steinberg's story is simply a fitting end for an era in which ruthless corporate raiders destroyed corporations and laid off tens of thousands of employees.</p>
        <p>Then again, it is very, very difficult to envision a day when Mr. Gates would be forced to auction off his living-room drapes.</p>
