        <p>Several top agency executives are changing jobs.</p>
        <p>Nancy Hill, senior vice president and chief client officer at GMO/Hill Holliday in San Francisco, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, is being promoted to president.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hill, 42, succeeds Brian O'Neill, chief creative officer, who was promoted to vice chairman when the agency was formed by the merger of Goldberg Moser O'Neill with Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos. Ms. Hill joined Goldberg Moser in November 1998 as vice president and director for business development.</p>
        <p>Darcia Joseph, 41, president and chief operating officer at the Canadian operations of Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising in Toronto, is leaving, effective in the fall. John Farquhar, 44, executive vice president and co-creative director, will become president and chief creative officer; a search for a chief operating officer is under way.</p>
        <p>Ms. Joseph, who joined Y.&amp; R. Canada in February 1999, said she was considering her future plans.</p>
        <p>And at the Pittsburgh office of Bozell Kamstra Advertising and Public Relations, part of the Bozell Group unit of True North Communications, C. Raymond Werner, 61, senior vice president and general manager, is relinquishing those duties. He will take the new title of executive creative director, reporting to the Minneapolis headquarters of Bozell Kamstra, through the end of 2000, when he plans to retire. Robert Bernardini, 55, managing partner and director for client services, succeeds Mr. Werner as general manager in Pittsburgh.</p>
