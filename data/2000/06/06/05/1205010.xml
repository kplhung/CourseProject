        <p>Three years ago, Judge Roy S. Moore became an icon of the Christian conservative movement by defying the order of another Alabama judge that he remove the Ten Commandments from the wall behind his bench and stop opening court sessions with a prayer.</p>
        <p>Today, proudly unrepentant, Judge Moore of the Circuit Court in Gadsden is trading on his renown to run for chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, the top judicial post in the state. And only days before the Republican primary on Tuesday, leading political observers in Alabama say he just may win.</p>
        <p>Judge Moore's campaign against three Republican opponents is the latest battle for party supremacy between the religious right and the business community in Alabama. In October, Christian conservatives scored a major success by voting down the lottery.</p>
        <p>Perhaps more significantly, a win by Judge Moore would affirm that there are places in the country, and Alabama has been the epicenter, where voters are simply fed up with the breadth of the separation between church and state.</p>
        <p>Judge Moore taps into that discontent by arguing that many Americans, and activist judges in particular, have misinterpreted the founding fathers' intent. He contends that the removal of God from public life has contributed to school shootings, an expansion of gay rights and other examples of what he sees as moral decay.</p>
        <p>''We've forgotten that judges shouldn't be running around trying to form society into something they think it should be,'' he told members of the Kiwanis Club here today. ''They've taken something away from us that is the most valuable thing that our forefathers held dear, the freedom to worship God, publicly, privately, in the manner we choose.''</p>
        <p>But Judge Moore, 53, does not stop at promoting himself as a strict constructionist. Man's law, he insists, is deeply rooted in God's law as revealed by the Holy Scriptures. Furthermore, he says, his study of Washington, Jefferson and Madison has convinced him that the United States is a Christian nation that was founded on Christian principles.</p>
        <p>''They did not say it's a Christian nation by establishment,'' he said in an interview. ''In other words, you do not have to worship God as a Christian. But that did not mean that our principles, our foundation, our business organizations, our fraternal and civic organizations, were not founded by Christian principles and that Christian principles did not govern the laws of our land.''</p>
        <p>Such assertions appall those who believe the First Amendment provides absolute protection for religious minorities against the potential tyranny of the majority.</p>
        <p>''Judge Moore, if he's elected, must understand that it's the Constitution and not the Bible that governs Alabama,'' said Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, in Washington. ''His understanding of the Constitution can only be described as bizarre.''</p>
        <p>It is telling, however, that none of Judge Moore's Republican opponents have tried to depict him as extreme. Indeed, Associate Justice Harold See of the State Supreme Court, who is trying to move to the chief justice's chair, has advertised his own work, while a law professor, in researching Judge Moore's Ten Commandments defense.</p>
        <p>Both public and private polls have consistently shown Judge Moore with a lead but falling below the majority he would need to win without a runoff. In addition to Justice See, his opponents are Judge Wayne Thorn of the Circuit Court in Birmingham and Judge Pam Baschab of the Court of Criminal Appeals in Montgomery. The winner will face the Democratic candidate, Sharon Yates, in November.</p>
        <p>Judicial elections in Alabama are highly partisan, often pitting business-minded Republicans who favor restrictions on tort claims against consumer-minded Democrats who have the backing of trial lawyers. Republicans currently hold a 5-to-4 majority on the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Justice See is the clear choice of the state's Republican political and business leadership. He received $150,000 from the Business Council of Alabama last month, the largest of his $1.14 million in contributions, and has made heavy purchases of television advertising. Judge Moore has raised $260,000, enough to run a few advertisements on cable television.</p>
        <p>Judge Moore has received a lift, however, from Judge Thorn, who hopes to squeeze into a runoff by attacking Justice See for abandoning his seat in order to run for chief justice. If Justice See wins, Judge Thorn points out, the state's Democratic governor, Donald Siegelman, could appoint a Democratic successor and reverse the court's majority.</p>
        <p>Wayne Flynt, a historian at Auburn University, said he expected Judge Moore to win.</p>
        <p>''An awful lot of the Republicans in Alabama,'' Mr. Flynt said, ''are George Wallace Democrats who crossed over in the culture wars -- women need to stay in their place, we need a restoration of morality in schools -- and Roy Moore really resonates with them.''</p>
        <p>Even some of Justice See's supporters said this week that they expected Judge Moore to finish first on Tuesday, though not with a majority.</p>
        <p>Judge Moore's primary political assets are his name recognition and his reputation as a man of conviction. In 1995, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him in an effort to remove the Ten Commandments and end his courtroom prayers. It took nearly three years, but by 1998 both a federal judge and the State Supreme Court had thrown out the lawsuit on technical grounds without resolving the underlying issues.</p>
        <p>In the interim, a circuit court judge had ordered Judge Moore to remove the tablets and cease the prayers. Judge Moore refused, becoming an instant hero to thousands of Alabamians who held rallies in his defense. At one point, Fob James Jr., then the governor, threatened to call out the National Guard to defend the Ten Commandments against court-ordered removal.</p>
        <p>Judge Moore's admirers clearly like both his principles and the ramrod style he developed as a West Point cadet, a military policeman in Vietnam and a local prosecutor. He footnotes both speeches and conversations with memorized recitations of historical tracts -- letters from Madison, writings by John Locke -- almost always to support his proposition that the founders recognized government's subordination to God.</p>
        <p>In his appearances today, Judge Moore did not hesitate to criticize the courts for legalizing abortion and for pushing Vermont lawmakers to allow gay unions. Without a moral and legal standard based on Scripture, he said, the logical extension will be laws allowing unions between ''two men and four women,'' or between ''a sheep and a man.''</p>
        <p>''Let me ask you this,'' he said. ''Are you going to pay your tax money to support a man and a sheep on welfare? Hmmm?''</p>
        <p>Judge Moore is also something of a poet. ''While truth and law were founded upon the God of all creation, man through law now denies him and calls it separation,'' he said, closing his Kiwanis speech. ''Children are told they can't pray in school and they teach them evolution. Why can't they see the fear of God is the only true solution?''</p>
