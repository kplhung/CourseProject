        <p>Dallas forward Jamie Langenbrunner is expected to play for the first time in these Stanley Cup finals when the Stars meet the Devils on Monday night in Game 4. With the Stars trailing, two games to one, nobody should be happier than Dallas center Joe Nieuwendyk to see Langenbrunner back on his left wing.</p>
        <p>Nieuwendyk won the Conn Smythe Trophy last season as the most valuable player of the playoffs, in which the Stars took their first Stanley Cup. In the finals this year, however, Langenbrunner has had a knee injury and Nieuwendyk has been a ghost.</p>

        <p>Dallas forward Jamie Langenbrunner is expected to play for the first time in these Stanley Cup finals when the Stars meet the Devils on Monday night in Game 4. With the Stars trailing, two games to one, nobody should be happier than Dallas center Joe Nieuwendyk to see Langenbrunner back on his left wing.</p>
        <p>Nieuwendyk won the Conn Smythe Trophy last season as the most valuable player of the playoffs, in which the Stars took their first Stanley Cup. In the finals this year, however, Langenbrunner has had a knee injury and Nieuwendyk has been a ghost.</p>
        <p>Last year the Stars had a potent second line featuring Nieuwendyk and Langenbrunner to complement Mike Modano and Brett Hull on their top line. Nieuwendyk led all playoff scorers with 11 goals last year and tied the National Hockey League record for most game-winning goals in one playoff year with six. He and Langenbrunner combined for 21 playoff goals last season.</p>
        <p>The Stars have lacked that second-line punch this season.</p>
        <p>Dallas Coach Ken Hitchcock went so far as to change his strategy from Games 1 and 2 and shy away from playing Modano's line against Jason Arnott's. ''We have to try and break even against Arnott,'' Hitchcock said.</p>
        <p>But Arnott's line dominated an older, slower line centered by the Stars' Guy Carbonneau in Game 3, which the Devils won, 2-1; Arnott's line accounted for both goals. For the second time in three games, Arnott's line played the more decisive role.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's any secret right now that we've got one line that is obviously concerning Jersey,'' Hitchcock said. ''We need more from more players to win this series.''</p>
        <p>Langenbrunner has been out since Game 5 of the Western Conference finals with a sprained knee. Nieuwendyk has no goals or assists in the five games Langenbrunner has missed.</p>
        <p>Two questions put to Hitchcock today were: How much has Nieuwendyk missed Langenbrunner? And is it a valid excuse?</p>
        <p>''I don't know,'' Hitchcock said. ''This is a game about adjustments. We have learned how to play without people all year. I think it is less about that and more going into the critical areas to score. I think that all of us, Joe included, but also Mike and Brett -- you are not going to score from a distance against this team. You are going to have to get into gritty areas to score, and that's really the bottom line. And Joe knows that.''</p>
        <p>He just had not been able to do it.</p>
        <p>''I think the thing we'd like to see more from Joe is that he doesn't play to score, he plays the game,'' Hitchcock said. ''What we'd like to see is when you look at Nieuwendyk at the end of the game, he is front and center. He's gotten his chances. He's been one of the best players on the ice. We'd like to see him dictate that tempo early. He has done that at critical stages in series past. But sometimes in those series, these games haven't happened until Game 5 or sometimes even Game 6. This is Game 4 tomorrow, and we need it now.''</p>
        <p>Nieuwendyk, 33, has complained lately that he has not had a good scoring wing to play with since Langenbrunner was injured. But he was not available to speak to reporters today.</p>
        <p>So the questions about Nieuwendyk's lack of production were put to Hitchcock.</p>
        <p>''Joe is like any other scorer,'' Hitchcock said. ''He is a lot, in our case, like Brett Hull. When you are a scorer and you are scoring, it seems that every part of your game is energized. Joe is a perfect example. He is a streaky player. And if he scores early, like he did at times during the last two series, then he is a very effective player for that game and for the next few games.</p>
        <p>''But when you don't score, you start thinking too much. I find that with great offensive players and great scorers, when they start thinking, that is when they are at their worst.''</p>
        <p>Nieuwendyk scored just 15 goals this season, the lowest total of his 13-year N.H.L. career. He played 48 regular-season games, missing 21 with a separated right shoulder. Hitchcock noted that Nieuwendyk and his regular linemates, Langenbrunner and Scott Thornton, were together for about 15 games.</p>
        <p>''It has been a very good line for us,'' Hitchcock said, ''but they haven't played together very much.''</p>
        <p>The line could very well be reunited Monday night.</p>
