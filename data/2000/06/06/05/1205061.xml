        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick A. Lazio shook hands and stood side by side yesterday, both vowing to support the political and economic stability of Israel. But along the Fifth Avenue route of New York City's annual Salute to Israel Parade, the intense, even angry, division among Jews over the two United States Senate candidates was starkly on display.</p>
        <p>The parade, like so many others in New York, typically draws a healthy contingent of vote-seeking politicians. But this year, the political jockeying was so pervasive and the crowd seemed so politically engaged that even some organizers said that campaigning was overshadowing the purpose of the event, to celebrate the 52 years of Israeli statehood.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio marched yesterday with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, just ahead of the New York City Police Department marching band. Mrs. Clinton was farther back, beside Senator Charles E. Schumer and a collection of leaders of Jewish groups.</p>
        <p>The first lady proved to be the biggest media attraction, drawing such a large pack of television cameras and photographers that her security team stretched out a rope to corral them. But she also inspired the most vociferous reaction from the crowd, with spectators sporadically booing, screaming and sometimes even crudely insulting her as she passed.</p>
        <p>Also marching along the 22-block parade route, in addition to the groups of children, religious clubs and community associations, were three likely future candidates for mayor -- Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, Public Advocate Mark Green and the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone -- as well as many other state and local officials.</p>
        <p>''Hillary brings out passions in people,'' said Mr. Green, who described the crowd as perhaps the most intense he had seen in his decade of marching in parades in the city.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton went to great lengths to try to demonstrate their devotion to Israel, as both candidates, in what has quickly become a competitive race, clearly recognize the importance of the large number of Jewish voters in New York City.</p>
        <p>But despite their competition for votes, the Senate candidates were quite cordial with each other. They shook hands and chatted briefly about Mr. Lazio's two daughters during a break in the parade while they stood at a reviewing stand on Fifth Avenue at 69th Street. It was Mr. Lazio's and Mrs. Clinton's first joint appearance since Mr. Giuliani last month dropped out of the nation's highest profile Senate race and Mr. Lazio replaced him as the Republican nominee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio repeatedly spoke yesterday about his support for moving the United States embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, to recognize the city that Israel claims as its capital. Mrs. Clinton, who also supports such a move, spoke more generally about what she called her longstanding respect for the country and its people.</p>
        <p>''The United States has been and will be always there for Israel,'' she said, drawing applause from crowd, including the mayor and Mr. Lazio.  ''And we will always support the Israeli government and Israeli people as they struggle to find a safe and secure peace.''</p>
        <p>The two candidates stayed away from more controversial topics, such as whether there should be an independent Palestinian state. Mrs. Clinton angered many Jewish voters last year when she voiced support for such a state.</p>
        <p>''I am going to take the lead of the state of Israel on this,'' Mr. Lazio said yesterday when asked by a reporter about the topic. ''I have some serious questions about whether or not a Palestinian state is sustainable, considering the security concerns of the State of Israel.''</p>
        <p>But the animosity felt by some in the crowd toward Mrs. Clinton was evident on nearly every block, with some holding signs recalling her embrace last year of Yasir Arafat's wife, Suha, while others shouted, ''Go back to Arkansas,'' mocking her move last year to New York State and her bid as a Democrat for the Senate seat.</p>
        <p>Mira Hakak, a Queens statistician, held a torn-up Clinton campaign sign in her hands, just above an Israeli flag that was propped up in her pocketbook. ''She did not do anything in her life and now she wants to be our senator,'' Mrs. Hakak said. ''If she wants to be in Washington, she should get a job as a lawyer.''</p>
        <p>Emotions ran so high that brief scuffles at times broke out between the two camps, such as when one backer of Mrs. Clinton had her campaign sign pulled out of her hands and torn up. ''There was just a lot of hate,'' said Resi Cooper, 29, of Nassau County, a supporter of Mrs. Clinton, who said she was nearly knocked over by supporters of Mr. Lazio at one point during the parade.</p>
        <p>Also amid the crowd were many undecided voters, like Lisa Rosenzweig, 39, a lawyer from Brooklyn, who said she generally votes for Democrats, but has not made up her mind in the Senate race.</p>
        <p>''How's your lip?'' she yelled to Mr. Lazio, whose lip was still swollen from a fall he took in a Memorial Day parade on Long Island. She later told a reporter that she considered Mr. Lazio a worthy candidate and would not likely decide on her vote until November.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, who was campaigning for his second time with Mr. Lazio, at times seemed to attract more attention than the Long Island congressman, with spectators chanting his name and some even holding his old Senate campaign signs. But the mayor appeared to make an effort to let Mr. Lazio take the lead, allowing him to decide when to break away from the parade and greet supporters.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton dashed from the end of the Salute to Israel Parade to the smaller Philippine-American Friendship Day Parade on Madison Avenue in Midtown. Mrs. Clinton received a much warmer welcome from this crowd, some of her supporters so excited that they tried to climb over police officers to reach her. Asked about being booed at the Salute to Israel Parade, she responded: ''I had a great time. I mean, that's democracy.''</p>
