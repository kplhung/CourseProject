        <p>At the Summer Olympics in Sydney, NBC Sports will carry 161 hours and MSNBC and CNBC will telecast 276 1/2 more hours on cable.</p>
        <p>Soon after, also from Sydney, Wemedia.com will Webcast at least 100 hours of the Paralympics, which are contested by disabled athletes.</p>
        <p>This is not prime-time television, but Wemedia Corporation, which owns the Internet site and publishes We, a slick magazine for disabled people, from its downtown Manhattan office, is capitalizing on advances in streaming video to bring the Paralympics to computers from Oct. 18 to 29. After the Paralympics, the company plans to Webcast two events a month.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to create access and mobility to watch the games for people nobody have cared about, and make it free to the world,'' Cary Fields, Wemedia's president, said. ''The computer makes the disabilities disappear. It's the ultimate enabler.''</p>
        <p>Wemedia's plans for the 18-sport Paralympics are ambitious: three separate daily feeds of 12 hours of live events, feature and studio coverage, from 7:30 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. Eastern, which would be repeated for the next 12 hours.</p>
        <p>''Track and field and swimming and velodrome cycling could all be starting at once, and you can go to one for two or three hours, then switch to another,'' said Rick Gentile, the executive producer of Wemedia Sports, who served in the same position at CBS Sports.</p>
        <p>In addition to shifting among three video feeds, there will be a second screen offering a continuous flow of accompanying information.</p>
        <p>''We have a blank slate -- an entire network to program,'' said Gentile, who was a top programming or production executive during CBS's telecasts of the 1992, 1994 and 1998 Winter Olympics. ''And with three feeds, we'd better be good. A lot will depend on our Web site boys to synchronize it all together.''</p>
        <p>Wemedia tested its technology in April at the Paralympic sailing trials and plans more tests next month at the track and field and swimming trials. The quality of the Webcast depends on the abilities of the computers receiving it as well as on the equipment Wemedia uses to transmit the video. Nonetheless, the quality of streaming video in general seems to improve on an almost daily basis.</p>
        <p>''A few weeks ago, I would have said TV is TV, but this is different,'' Gentile said. ''What works on TV doesn't necessarily work on the Web. Pictures and graphics are smaller. But on a laptop, where you'll have one box with a moving pictures, we can synchronize graphics in a way that makes this unique.''</p>
        <p>Wemedia's primary goal is to expand the presence of the underexposed Paralympics -- and bring new members to its Web site, which will add a much larger sports news and information component today. But it also intends to spread the gospel about the extraordinary skills of the thousands of athletes who are blind, paraplegic, amputees or mentally retarded or have cerebral palsy.</p>
        <p>Charlie Huebner, executive director of the United States Association of Blind Athletes, doubted that Wemedia would face a shortage of events.</p>
        <p>''We have 300 to 400 local, regional and national events within our own organization,'' he said. ''Wemedia is helping parents and kids find out what events are out there.''</p>
        <p>Arthur Pincus, the vice president for content of Wemedia Sports, added: ''There are basketball tournaments, rugby, tennis tournaments, sailing regattas, skiing and expedition-adventure events. There's no question we'll have enough to do two events a month.''</p>
        <p>Olympic viewers are accustomed to network features about athletes that often strain to find the obstacles, family tragedies or melodramatic woes that formed them.</p>
        <p>''Here every story smacks you in the face,'' Gentile said. ''They're all remarkable. At the dock where the athletes get on the boats, many have to be picked up or hoisted into the boats. Then you see 30 empty wheelchairs and prosthetic arms and legs on the dock.''</p>
        <p>To advocates of the disabled, Wemedia's sports strategy fills a long-overlooked void and will provide broad recognition for their athleticism .</p>
        <p>''It's crazy to think only disabled people will watch disabled events,'' said Deborah Bonsack, executive director of America's Athletes With Disabilities, which promoted 190 disabled sports events last year. ''People need to think of disabled sports as sports played by people with different physical compositions.''</p>
        <p>If Wemedia finds viewer success in Webcasting the Paralympics and other events, she said: ''Folks will have a shift in opinion. You'll hear people stop and say, 'How does that amputee swimmer do that?' ''</p>
        <p>Andrew Imparato, president of the American Association of People With Disabilities, said: ''Too often, the public view of people with disabilities is a charity model, that we need to raise money for them. But the Paralympics and Special Olympics show disabled people achieving well beyond what people with disabilities are supposed to be able to do.''</p>
        <p>He cautioned that many disabled people -- as well as those who are able-bodied -- cannot afford a computer and cannot view the Webcast of the Paralympics.</p>
        <p>But with the United States television rights, on top of its world Web rights deal, Wemedia has a TV strategy. It is seeking a cable partner for daily reports, and a broadcaster for a post-Paralympics special.</p>
        <p>''We want the Webcast to enhance the broadcasts,'' said Jay Rosenstein, the vice president for programming of Wemedia Sports, ''and the broadcasts to make the public aware of the Webcast.''</p>
