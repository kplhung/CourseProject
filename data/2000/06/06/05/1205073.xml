        <p>A die-hard group of regulars settled into black folding chairs in the library of an elegant brownstone on the Upper East Side. They come every month to hear about any and all things pertaining to the realm of parapsychology.</p>
        <p>Once, the lecture was about surviving death. Other lectures had been on out-of-body experiences, seances, channeling and remote viewing, a form of clairvoyance.</p>
        <p>On this particular night, the audience leaned close to hear whether Harry Houdini, the magician and escape artist, communicated a secret message from beyond the grave in 1929 to his widow, Beatrice, through a man described as a trance medium. The question has long been pondered among Houdini aficionados.</p>
        <p>The speaker, William V. Rauscher, a retired Episcopal priest and psychic researcher, did not keep the audience in suspense for long. He said that it was all a hoax and that the medium, Arthur Ford, had conspired with Houdini's widow. Mr. Rauscher told the audience that he believed that Mr. Ford had psychic abilities, just not in this instance.  Still, some in the audience wanted the real goods. An intense little man with coal-black hair raised his hand and asked why Houdini had failed to communicate from the grave.</p>
        <p>''Because he was dead,'' said Mr. Rauscher, as muffled cackles arose from here and there in the packed library. ''It just didn't happen.''</p>
        <p>And so it was the other night at the Eileen J. Garrett Library of the Parapsychology Foundation. The library is stocked with more than 10,000 volumes on matters including ghosts, poltergeists, psychic spies, healing research and spiritualism.</p>
        <p>It is a place where just about any assumption might be contemplated, and where psychic phenomena are accorded the respect that they have yet to receive in the material world beyond the tastefully appointed brownstone on East 71st Street.</p>
        <p>The other night, the foundation's executive director, Lisette Coly, was standing in the hallway, watching the audience watch the lecturer. Her diminutive 84-year-old mother, Eileen Coly, sat near the carpeted staircase leading to the second floor. Upstairs is home to an audiovisual lab, a periodicals room and a rare-books collection, which includes a pigskin-bound volume in Latin that dates from the 1500's. A taffy-colored cat named Sushi, who lives in the brownstone, lorded over the front reception desk.</p>
        <p>The library has one of the world's largest collections of parapsychology books, according to Ms. Coly. The foundation was established in 1951 by her maternal grandmother, Eileen Garrett, a writer and a so-called trance medium who died in 1970. It was endowed by Mrs. Garrett's close friend Frances Payne Bolton, a wealthy Ohio Republican who served in the House of Representatives from 1940 to 1968.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Garrett accepted her psychic abilities as a fact of life, her granddaughter said, though she also was known for her skepticism. Ms. Coly recalled her saying: ''Monday, Wednesday and Friday, I believe in the paranormal. Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, I don't. Sunday, I don't give a damn.'' Ms. Coly shares her grandmother's ambivalence, though she claims no psychic ability.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of things that cross my desk that I cannot understand,'' said Ms. Coly, 50. ''I see stuff that is very provocative and very suggestive of a psychic explanation, and yet I see people who are harmed by charlatans every day.''</p>
        <p>On a recent Wednesday, Ms. Coly was introducing that night's lecturer, Mr. Rauscher, and welcoming the two dozen or so people who were taking their seats. She wants to raise awareness about parapsychology by holding more lectures at the library, which is open to the public. ''Parapsychology wants to look at all this murky seance stuff in the bright light of day with scientific methodology,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But even Ms. Coly, a good-humored woman with shoulder-length blond hair, admits that it can be tough sometimes. When she meets people for the first time, especially at PTA meetings -- she has two school-age children -- she plays it safe, saying only that she is the executive director of a nonprofit foundation.</p>
        <p>''Parapsychology elicits a very strong response, and I don't want to open that can of worms,'' she said.</p>
        <p>For many of the people attending the lecture, it is precisely their concern about being ostracized that makes the library such a comforting place. A middle-aged man, whose business card indicated that he was a physician and cancer researcher in New York City, asked to remain anonymous. He said his belief in psychic phenomena could jeopardize his high-level hospital position.</p>
        <p>(The physician is convinced that two of his patients had out-of-body experiences, with one elderly, comatose woman floating to the hospital ceiling and watching her own death before she was resuscitated.)</p>
        <p>''For some people, thinking there is communication from the other world is very weird,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Some people would burn us at the stake,'' his female companion added.</p>
        <p>At the library that night, some who gathered had spent much of their lives contemplating psychic issues. Among them was Hans Holzer, an elderly author of dozens of books who describes himself as a scientific investigator of the paranormal but is more commonly known as a ghost hunter. His most recent books include ''Hans Holzer's Travel Guide to Haunted Houses'' and ''Psychic: True Paranormal Experiences.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Holzer likes to catch up with old friends and hear about new interpretations of psychic phenomena at the monthly forums. The other evening, he leaned over to chat with his longtime friend Martin Ebon. Mr. Ebon, 83, has written ''Psychic Warfare: Threat or Illusion?,'' about Russian military research into the paranormal, among other books.</p>
        <p>''I find the atmosphere is one of openness,'' Dr. Holzer said. ''By and large, there is a nucleus of people like me there every month.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Holzer later said he was unmoved by the Houdini lecture. (He is convinced that a secret code was relayed by Houdini to his wife.) Dr. Holzer pointedly noted that Mr. Rauscher has a background as a magician. (Mr. Rauscher was introduced as belonging to England's Magic Circle and the International Brotherhood of Magicians.)</p>
        <p>''It was a waste of time; it had nothing to do with parapsychology,'' Dr. Holzer said sternly of Mr. Rauscher's lecture. ''Let me put it this way: I never trust a magician fully. Magicians believe firmly that psychic phenomena are all fake.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rauscher, the author of a new book, ''The Houdini Code Mystery,'' insists that he is not a psychic debunker. He believes in extrasensory perception and the mystical experience, but says he cannot be tricked easily.</p>
        <p>Sally Ann Drucker, who teaches in the English department at Nassau Community College, was also expecting to hear something else from Mr. Rauscher, but because he is a man of the cloth: ''I thought that he would not find reasons to disbelieve what Arthur Ford had been saying through his mediumship.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Drucker, an author who specializes in children's psychic experiences, has become a regular at the Wednesday night lectures.</p>
        <p>Later that night, Ms. Drucker and eight other people went to an Upper East Side restaurant, where they chewed over details of that night and the world of parapsychology.</p>
        <p>''Every night, it's different,'' Ms. Drucker said. ''A lot of these people have been in the field for a long time and have published in it. It's sort of like a way of having a little community get-together in the field of parapsychology in New York City. We catch up with who is doing what, where. It's a small world.''</p>
