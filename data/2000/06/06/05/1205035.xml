        <p>ARNOLD PALMER had never had such a terrible first round at the Masters. America's golfer, a four-time winner at Augusta National, had opened the 1985 Masters with an embarrassing 83, and now, as he was about to tee off in the second round, somebody asked Winnie Palmer if her famous husband had considered withdrawing.</p>
        <p>''No,'' she said, ''he considered shooting a 67.''</p>
        <p>He did not shoot 67 that day, but he did shoot a smooth par 72 while his wife was shooting down anybody who made the mistake of even wondering if he might have thought about withdrawing.</p>
        <p>That was Winifred Walzer Palmer, the woman behind the man who put ''charge'' into the golf vocabulary, the woman who died last Nov. 20 of abdominal cancer.</p>
        <p>''Arnold has had his share of good fortune in life,'' his lawyer and agent, Mark McCormack, has said, ''and the best fortune of all was marrying Winnie. From the beginning, she brought to Arnold an ability to cope with the kind of problems he never knew existed. She was astute, discerning and a realist.</p>
        <p>''For years she was wife and secretary and business consultant. She handled the family finances. She balanced the books, paid the bills, made the travel arrangements, mailed the entry blanks and devoted her entire attention to one goal: making sure that her husband's mind was free to concentrate on his golf.''</p>
        <p>She also devoted herself to the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Women and Children in Orlando, Fla., and to their hometown Latrobe, Pa., hospital, library and St. Vincent's College.</p>
        <p>In her memory, the Metropolitan Golf Writers Association instituted the Winnie Palmer award for ''an individual in golf who has consistently given their time, energy and enthusiasm to those less fortunate.'' At its national awards dinner tonight at the Westchester Marriott, the first recipient of the bronze sculpture will be Barbara Nicklaus. ''Barbara and Jack have been our close friends for many years,'' Arnold Palmer said. ''Winnie would be as pleased as I am.''</p>
        <p>Barbara Nicklaus has raised more than $10 million for charities, including the Children's Hospital of Columbus (Ohio), the American Cancer Society, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and the Chi Chi Rodriguez Youth Foundation.</p>
        <p>''Winnie would be embarrassed by the award,'' said Donald Giffin, the longtime aide-de-camp to Arnold Palmer known as Doc, ''but she would be delighted that Barbara's getting it.''</p>
        <p>Marty Walzer, Winnie's brother, remembered the Saturday in 1954 when he noticed his parents and 19-year-old sister talking in their Coopersburg, Pa., home.</p>
        <p>''I was 13,'' he said, ''old enough to know that just from the way they were talking, it was serious. The previous Tuesday night, Arnold, who had just won the United States Amateur, had met Winnie at a party for a golf tournament at Shawnee-on-Delaware, and now she was telling my mother and father that on Friday night Arnold had proposed to her.''</p>
        <p>Two months later, they eloped to Falls Church, Va., near the home of Arnold's sister, Cheech.</p>
        <p>''My mother was all for it,'' Marty Walzer said, ''but Dad had reservations. He came around eventually, but after Winnie and Arnold had their two daughters, Peggy and Amy, I remember Dad telling Arnold, 'You wait and see, you'll feel the same way I did.' ''</p>
        <p>In Arnold's rookie year on the PGA Tour, he and Winnie traveled to tournaments with a trailer hitched to his coral pink Ford. ''At the Masters,'' Marty Walzer said, ''the trailer park was next to a drive-in movie. I sat outside the trailer and watched the movie.''</p>
        <p>Soon after that, Palmer's charisma put him center stage as a golfer. Then he developed into a multimillion-dollar golf conglomerate.</p>
        <p>''Winnie never lost her perspective; the money never changed her,'' said Marty Walzer, who owns the Pine Barn Inn in Danville, Pa. ''She was as comfortable with Mamie Eisenhower and Barbara Bush as she was with my baker. She was so accommodating to everyone, so genuine. I don't think she had an enemy.''</p>
        <p>Winnie also knew how to surprise her husband.</p>
        <p>On his 37th birthday, the doorbell rang in their Latrobe home. ''Answer it, Arn,'' she said. ''It's the TV repairman.''</p>
        <p>But when Arnold opened the door, he saw a golf pal. ''Could you put up an old friend for the night?'' Dwight D. Eisenhower asked.</p>
        <p>Winnie Palmer had arranged for Arnold's jet to pick up the former president at his Gettsyburg, Pa., farm. She also took care of most of the other details of her famous husband's birthday party.</p>
        <p>That, too, was Winnie Palmer.</p>
