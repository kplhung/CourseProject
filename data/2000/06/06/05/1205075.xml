        <p>At the moment yesterday morning when the flat, pink glow of dawn gave way to yellow sunlight and shadow, Spencer Tunick announced that his photo shoot was complete.

        <p>At the moment yesterday morning when the flat, pink glow of dawn gave way to yellow sunlight and shadow, Spencer Tunick announced that his photo shoot was complete. One hundred fifty-two naked models, who had been lying on an empty stretch of Delancey Street, under the Williamsburg Bridge, sprang to their feet and applauded.</p>
        <p>The moment was triumphant, or at least worry free, for Mr. Tunick, who is known for his photographs of nudes in public places, and for being arrested while taking them. On Saturday, the United States Supreme Court said the city could not stop him from staging his picture, and Mr. Tunick hopes that the decision will effectively, if not technically, end a long First Amendment battle.</p>
        <p>With a handful of police officers looking on, Mr. Tunick said he was thankful that he could work without the fear of being jailed.</p>
        <p>''This is a victory for the body as an art object, not a sexual object or a recreational object,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Keith Finney, a bartender and a frequent model for Mr. Tunick, said the photographs, which often show bodies arranged in abstract forms, emphasized people's similarities.</p>
        <p>''It's like when you watch those shows on the Discovery Channel and you see a herd of antelope,'' he said. ''This is like a herd of naked people. We're so used to looking at the clothes to define a person.''</p>
        <p>As soon as the shoot was over, on went the hooded sweatshirts, the silk skirts, the bike shorts and the jeans. Many of the models, all volunteers, headed to Ratner's, a few blocks away, for a celebratory breakfast.</p>
        <p>There, Mr. Tunick, 33, moved from table to table, jittery from the morning's high-speed logistics. A federal judge had granted him only 15 minutes for the shoot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tunick began shooting public nudes in 1992, when he posed a naked man in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia. He has been arrested a handful of times, on charges including unlawful assembly and exposure of a person, but they have always been dismissed.</p>
        <p>In 1999, he sued New York City in federal court, seeking, among other things, an injunction to prevent the arrests.</p>
        <p>Michael Hess, the city's corporation counsel, acknowledged that the city had received no complaints about the shoots. But, he said, ''people who do not choose to watch it are being exposed to it.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Tunick said he knew that shooting nude people en masse was not always appropriate. ''I don't think I could do this in the middle of the day in front of Macy's,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hess said the city had not decided whether to try to block future shoots. In an earlier ruling in Mr. Tunick's case, two federal judges criticized the city for causing a ''relentless onslaught'' of First Amendment litigation.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Hess nor Ronald L. Kuby, Mr. Tunick's lawyer, would estimate the total cost of the legal proceedings. But Mr. Kuby did say his client had asked for damages and lawyers' fees that would run into six figures.</p>
