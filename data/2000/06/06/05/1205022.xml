        <p>For the first time in 30 years, the third jewel in horse racing's Triple Crown will not have either the Kentucky Derby winner or the Preakness winner in the starting gate. The trainer Neil Drysdale announced yesterday that Fusaichi Pegasus injured his right hoof and would not race Saturday in the Belmont Stakes.</p>
        <p>The injury occurred at 2 p.m. last Saturday when a blacksmith working on another horse in Barn 1 at Aqueduct dropped a tool and startled Fusaichi Pegasus, who was asleep in the back of his stall. The Derby winner jumped forward, lost his footing, slid into the door and sustained a cut about the size of a dime in his right front hoof wall.</p>

        <p>For the first time in 30 years, the third jewel in horse racing's Triple Crown will not have either the Kentucky Derby winner or the Preakness winner in the starting gate. The trainer Neil Drysdale announced yesterday that Fusaichi Pegasus injured his right hoof and would not race Saturday in the Belmont Stakes.</p>
        <p>The injury occurred at 2 p.m. last Saturday when a blacksmith working on another horse in Barn 1 at Aqueduct dropped a tool and startled Fusaichi Pegasus, who was asleep in the back of his stall. The Derby winner jumped forward, lost his footing, slid into the door and sustained a cut about the size of a dime in his right front hoof wall.</p>
        <p>''He was immediately treated and bandaged and there is no soreness,'' Drysdale said. ''He'll be fine in five or six days, but if we trained him for the Belmont, it could lead to a larger crack in his hoof wall. You have to do what is right for the horse.''</p>
        <p>The mishap occurred seven days after Frank Stronach and Joe Orseno -- the owner and trainer of Red Bullet -- decided that their lightly raced colt needed to rest after beating Fusaichi Pegasus by nearly four lengths on a wet and taxing track in the Preakness on May 20.</p>
        <p>With no stirring rematch and no inherent drama of a horse trying to capture the Triple Crown as it had the past three years, the Belmont found attention focusing on the $4 million colt with a penchant for rodeo-style bucking in the morning and effortless and overpowering speed in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>Now, the $1 million Belmont is a wide-open Grade I race with a different kind of significance. Silver Charm, Real Quiet and Charismatic each failed in his bid to become the 12th horse in 123 years to sweep the grueling series, which demands that a 3-year-old horse prevail over a mile and a quarter, a mile and three-sixteenths and the Belmont's mile and a half in a span of five weeks.</p>
        <p>But not since 1970, when Dust Commander followed his victory in the Derby with a ninth-place finish behind the Preakness winner Personality, has the Belmont been without the winner of either race. Dust Commander skipped the Belmont and Personality scratched the day before the race because of injury.</p>
        <p>''We were intending to run no matter who showed up,'' said Todd Pletcher, who trains Impeachment, the third-place finisher in both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. ''This shows you how tough it is for horses to run these races. It just makes the Belmont that much more wide open.''</p>
        <p>If Impeachment indeed makes it to the starting gate, he will be the only one of 19 Derby starters to run in all three Triple Crown races. So far there are nine probable starters for the Belmont, though with the loss of the formidable Fusaichi Pegasus as well as Red Bullet that number may grow, perhaps to as many as 14.</p>
        <p>The likely favorite now is the Derby runner-up, Aptitude, who skipped the Preakness as did other contenders like Wheelaway, the fifth-place Derby finisher, and Curule, seventh in the Derby. The trainer of Aptitude, Bobby Frankel, acknowledged that his colt could run himself into contention for winning year-end honors with a victory in the Belmont.</p>
        <p>''With Fusaichi Pegasus not running, there's a potential for more uncertainty about the 3-year-old championship,'' Frankel said. ''Obviously, we would like to make a run for that. But right now, we're taking things one race at a time.''</p>
        <p>The new Triple Crown faces include the Peter Pan winner Postponed, Globalize, Tahkodha Hills, Appearing Now and Chief Seattle. It is likely that Commendable, who finished 17th in the Derby and Hugh Hefner, the sixth-place finisher in the Preakness, will move from the possible to the probable list, along with perhaps the Peter Pan runner-up Unshaded and any other horse whose connections believe their horse can go a mile and a half for a rich purse in a significant race.</p>
        <p>One thing is certain: for the first time since 1996, when Grindstone won the Derby, Louis Quatorze won the Preakness and Editor's Note won the Belmont, three horses will hold a victory in the spring's classic races.</p>
        <p>Drysdale said the owner of Fusaichi Pegasus, Fusao Sekiguchi, was disappointed by the development but agreed that the horse be held out of the Belmont and pointed to the Breeders' Cup Classic in November at Churchill Downs, where talk of a superhorse was prompted by his impressive victory in the Derby.</p>
        <p>The trainer, however, did not seem too shaken yesterday. He will be inducted into thoroughbred racing's Hall of Fame this summer in Saratoga, N.Y., and is admired for his cautious and conservative approach to handling horses. In 1992, he scratched A. P. Indy from the Derby on the morning of the race when the colt came up with a far more serious hoof injury. A. P. Indy returned to win the Belmont, as well as the Breeders' Cup Classic and was named Horse of the Year.</p>
        <p>Drysdale acknowledged that the first two legs of the Triple Crown had taken a lot out of Fusaichi Pegasus and was waiting on a workout scheduled for yesterday before committing him to the Belmont.</p>
        <p>''Maybe this is a blessing in disguise,'' he said. ''The decision whether or not to run him hadn't been made. Well, he made the decision himself.''</p>
