        <p>On one side are the Chamber of Commerce, Consumers Union, research librarians and Charles Schwab. On the other side are the New York Stock Exchange, real estate agents and the American Medical Association. Yahoo is on one side, eBay on the other.</p>
        <p>These odd alliances of lobbyists have formed over the question of whether databases -- collections of facts like telephone directories, weather reports, stock tables and real estate listings -- can be copied, repackaged and distributed by anyone with an Internet connection.</p>
        <p>Last year, the House Judiciary Committee approved a bill sponsored by Representative Howard Coble, Republican of North Carolina, that would establish criminal penalties for the unauthorized use of material in databases. Opponents say the bill would allow companies with databases to control access to facts.</p>
        <p>The measure, held up by competing commercial interests and a jurisdictional dispute in the House, seems unlikely to be enacted this year, but few other issues before Congress this year have generated so much lobbying. Advocates on both sides say their livelihoods are at stake.</p>
        <p>The National Association of Realtors, with members in every Congressional district, is one of the capital's most formidable lobbies. Last month, at the association's Washington meeting, hundreds of real estate agents visited their senators and representatives to argue that without the Coble bill, their multiple listing services were in danger of being pirated. Tennessee's senators, Bill Frist and Fred Thompson, both Republicans, were so besieged that they had to reserve a committee hearing room so they would have space for all the agents from their state.</p>
        <p>On the other side, lobbyists for Bloomberg L. P., the financial information service, have been telling lawmakers that if the Coble bill becomes law, the stock exchanges could make it impossible for the company to publish complex calculations about stock prices and trends. ''The bill would mean they would have absolute ownership right over something as basic as stock quotes,'' said Kevin Sheekey, a Bloomberg spokesman.</p>
        <p>Michael R. Bloomberg, the company's founder, is Northeastern vice chairman of the United States Chamber of Commerce, and largely because of his influence, the chamber has thrown its considerable lobbying weight into the fray. ''Factual data is the nuts and bolts of the information age,'' said Rick Lane, the chamber's chief lobbyist on technology issues. ''If you try to control its use, you're going to stifle commerce.''</p>
        <p>Both sides may be exaggerating. But the question of database piracy is one instance in which technology has developed so rapidly that it has outstripped the laws governing commercial relationships.</p>
        <p>Before there was an Internet, the issue was pretty well settled by copyright law. Creative works could be copyrighted; facts could not. If a database was nothing but a collection of raw facts -- say, a list of countries in Europe -- then it was public property. But if the compilation involved selection and coordination -- for instance, European countries ranked in order of their wine production -- then it could be copyrighted, and no one could use the list without permission.</p>
        <p>The courts have ruled, for example, that the telephone white pages cannot be copyrighted because the only arrangement involved is alphabetical. But the Yellow Pages are protected because someone had to select the various categories.</p>
        <p>Today, the sheer volume of information on the Internet, the ease with which it can be retrieved and the size of the potential profits have blurred the line between what is acceptable and what is not. For example, is the five-digit coding system for medical services and procedures developed by the American Medical Association more like the white pages or the Yellow Pages?</p>
        <p>Companies and interest groups have chosen sides on the issue depending on whether they primarily collect data that is put on the Internet (the stock exchanges, real estate brokers, Lexis-Nexis, eBay, the A.M.A.) or use the data compiled by someone else (the Chamber of Commerce, Consumers Union, Yahoo, Schwab, research librarians).</p>
        <p>EBay, the online auction company, is a collector. It worries that an ambitious Web meister will take its listing for, say, a set of Wedgwood china and the listings on all the other auction sites for a set of the same china and provide a new list for comparative shoppers.</p>
        <p>The company, which makes most of its money from transaction fees, could suffer from the competition. Even worse, a lobbyist for eBay said, is that the prices and availability of its items change minute by minute. The competing Web site could have misinformation. And customers would blame eBay, damaging its reputation and business.</p>
        <p>In fact, eBay recently sued a company called Bidder's Edge that has just the kind of Web site it fears. Last month, a Federal District Court in California issued a preliminary injunction preventing Bidder's Edge from using eBay's data.</p>
        <p>Associations of real estate brokers who run multiple listing services have won similar suits.</p>
        <p>A few cases have gone against the owners of databases. But even the legislation's proponents say that in almost every instance, companies that have been damaged because their databases were copied have been able to get relief in court.</p>
        <p>The opponents of the Coble bill say this shows that no sweeping new legislation is needed. ''Existing law takes care of any legitimate issue of database piracy,'' said Jonathan Band, a lawyer representing a group of Internet companies.</p>
        <p>Lee Verstandig, senior vice president of the National Association of Realtors, disagreed. ''We've been pretty lucky with these cases so far,'' he said. ''But we're afraid this isn't going to hold up much longer.''</p>
        <p>The bill's opponents have endorsed a measure sponsored by Thomas J. Bliley Jr., Republican of Virginia, who is chairman of the House Commerce Committee. The bill would allow the Federal Trade Commission to issue orders preventing inappropriate reproduction of databases.</p>
