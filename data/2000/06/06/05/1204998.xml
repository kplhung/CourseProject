        <p>Passions are not often stirred in Germany, a country that has learned to mistrust the giddier emotions, but a long-simmering battle for control of the annual Wagner Festival at Bayreuth is now coming to a head with an unusual clamor. At stake is the directorship of the festival, a position held for the past 49 years by Wolfgang Wagner, the composer's 80-year-old grandson. Because Bayreuth, where Wagner introduced his ''Ring of the Nibelung'' in 1876, occupies such a central, if contested, place in German culture, the fight is bitter and widely watched.</p>
        <p>In one corner sits Nike Wagner, the niece of the current director and his bitter foe, who recently published a stinging election manifesto in The Frankfurter Allgemeine, calling the festival old-fashioned, promising a ''trend-setting, contemporary Wagner'' and blasting a style ''enslaved to 19th-century Wagnerian mysticism.''</p>
        <p>Opposing her is Gudrun Wagner, the second wife of Wolfgang Wagner and, in the words of Daniel Barenboim, the director of the Staatsoper in Berlin and a man who worked for 18 years at Bayreuth, ''the woman he intends to put in his place.'' Mrs. Wagner has been fiercely loyal to her husband throughout a wave of recent criticism that has included comparisons of the ''late Wolfgang era'' to the stagnation of late Brezhnev.</p>
        <p>Between them stands a third candidate and a third woman, Eva Wagner-Pasquier, who is Mr. Wagner's daughter by his first marriage and has worked as an opera manager in Paris and the United States as well as in a leading organizational role at the music festival in Aix-en-Provence, France.</p>
        <p>No love is lost among these family members, who now await the word of the 24-member board of the Richard Wagner Foundation in Bayreuth. ''The board agreed on May 12 that its decision on a new director would be taken on June 5,'' said Joachim Oppold, a board spokesman.</p>
        <p>But there is a catch worthy of Joseph Heller's more twisted ruminations. While agreeing, at least in principal, that it would be salutary to find a successor, Mr. Wagner has taken the view that the vote should not constitute any sort of ultimatum, or even encouragement, for him to step down.</p>
        <p>In a statement issued recently Mr. Wagner said, ''The election of a successor does not mean that the present festival director is put under pressure to announce a specific point of time for resigning.'' Because his contract is for life, this position seems legally solid if infuriating to Mr. Wagner's critics, who have grown impatient with a festival that remains hugely popular -- demand for tickets always swamps supply -- but has been described by The Suddeutsche Zeitung as treading ''the narrow path between nostalgia and decay.''</p>
        <p>Udo Bernbach, a Wagner scholar, said: ''The legal position is that Wolfgang Wagner retains his position as long as he wants. He thought that perhaps he could indicate a successor. But if the person chosen is not his wife, he will take the view that he is there for life.''</p>
        <p>Whether he can defend that position is another matter. Pressure has been growing on Mr. Wagner to move on, and the board's determination to vote on a successor suggests that he may be vulnerable. The board includes representatives of the German government, the state of Bavaria, the town of Bayreuth and the family.</p>
        <p>Two factors -- apart from his tenure of almost a half-century -- have accentuated the pressure on Mr. Wagner. The first is musical. Many critics and musicians take the view that the innovative drive that characterized the festival in the immediate postwar decades has dried up.</p>
        <p>Wolfgang's brother, Wieland, who died in 1966 after running the festival for 15 years, was the more artistic of the siblings. If innovation survived his passing -- the postmodern centennial ''Ring'' of 1976 directed by Patrice Chereau and conducted by Pierre Boulez is widely remembered -- it has generally appeared less evident in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>The second pressure is political. The cult of Bayreuth, and it is intense, retains ties to the German right. Wolfgang Wagner is generally seen as having been reluctant to encourage open debate on the family's links to Hitler, the central role of Wagner's music under the Third Reich and the composer's own often scathing attitude toward the Jews.</p>
        <p>''Bayreuth is Germany's largest single contribution to musical culture at this moment, but it is unhealthy to have the family in charge,'' said Karen Painter, an assistant professor of music at Harvard. ''What has generally been encouraged is the fetish around the festival and a whitewash on anti-Semitism.'' Because some of the funds for the festival come from the state, the center-left coalition of Gerhard Schroder is in a position to wield some influence. It seems likely that it would push to see the result of any vote respected quickly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagner declined to be interviewed, as did the three candidates to succeed him. Bavaria is a place of conservative instincts, and the passions aroused by the succession have already caused unease. But the long manifesto from Nike Wagner suggested that she scents blood. Co-signed by Elmar Weingarten, general manager of the Berlin Philharmonic, it amounted to an unprecedented reach for power.</p>
        <p>''There is no dramaturgy behind the program as it stands today,'' she said. She called for the repertory to be extended because ''nothing decreed by Wagner's widow is sacrosanct.'' So performances of ''Rienzi,'' ''Die Feen'' (''The Fairies'') and ''Das Liebesverbot'' (''The Love Ban'') should be added to the ''Ring'' and ''Parsifal.'' The directorship should be restricted to a 10-year term, she said.</p>
        <p>Strong words. But as Mr. Barenboim said: ''There is a lot of pressure to decide what happens when Mr. Wagner goes. But who defines when he goes? He has a contract for life, and God, as far as I know, is not on the Richard Wagner Foundation board.''</p>
