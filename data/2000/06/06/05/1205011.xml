        <p>Ignoring stern warnings from the government in Jakarta, separatists in the province of West Papua made a declaration of independence today, in hopes of following the lead of East Timor, which broke away from Indonesia last year.</p>
        <p>About 3,000 supporters of separation gathered in what they called a ''congress'' this past week. Today, they unanimously endorsed the declaration and called on the United Nations to recognize a new state, which it is unlikely to do.</p>
        <p>''West Papua is independent and enjoys a status of sovereignty since the 1st December of 1961,'' said the statement, referring to the date of the territory's independence from the Netherlands, its former colonial overlord.</p>
        <p>The declaration was read by a separatist leader, Thaha Alhamid, to wild cheers at the gathering in Jayapura, the provincial capital. Thousands of people packed Jayapura's streets tonight to celebrate.</p>
        <p>President Abdurrahman Wahid of Indonesia, seeking to combat the specter of disintegration for his nation of 210 million people, has flatly ruled out independence for West Papua, which lies on the western half of the island of New Guinea.</p>
        <p>The area holds some of the world's most pristine rain forest, and its two million inhabitants, mostly Melanesians, are racially and culturally distinct from people in the rest of the vast Indonesian archipelago.</p>
        <p>The declaration said that ''Indonesia must recognize the sovereignty of West Papua, based on historical, cultural, ethnic and religious rights.''</p>
        <p>While most of the province's people live a strikingly primitive existence, often hunting with bows and arrows or spears, West Papua carries disproportionate importance to Indonesia's economy because of its giant copper and gold mines.</p>
        <p>''It's economic stature is very important,'' said Hasnan Habib, a leading analyst on political and military affairs, ''and if the other regions see that it is easy to get free, I think it would break us.</p>
        <p>''The armed forces would never want to see Irian Jaya separate from Indonesia,'' he added, using the territory's former name.</p>
        <p>Dharmawan Ronodipuro, Mr. Wahid's spokesman, said late today that West Papua was an integral part of the country and dismissed the independence declaration.</p>
        <p>Akbar Tanjung, speaker of the House of Representatives, said during a visit to Sumatra Province today that he had called Mr. Wahid and the commander of the armed forces and told them the legislature supported firm actions against any move toward separatism in any part of the country. Mr. Tanjung said the president assured him that he ''holds the same stance.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wahid, who faces other separatist movements in far-flung provinces, most notable a violent rebellion in Aceh Province, said on Saturday that while some Papuans wanted independence, a vast majority wished to remain part of Indonesia.</p>
        <p>But the independence leaders in West Papua, as well as many other people living there, have been deeply angered by years of perceived economic exploitation and human rights abuses at the hands of the military, and they were unmoved by the government's warnings.</p>
        <p>The gathering also called on the United States, the United Nations and the Netherlands to mediate a dialogue with Jakarta aimed at securing the province's separation.</p>
        <p>Few, however, believe that outside parties would support such a move. Unlike in East Timor, West Papua's independence movement has little international support.</p>
