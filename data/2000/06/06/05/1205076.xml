        <p>On the last weekend before New Jersey's tumultuous United States Senate primary, the crowded field of contenders thundered across the state today to reach voters from church basements to community picnics to meeting halls to old-fashioned diners.</p>
        <p>Representative Robert D. Franks, one of the strongest contenders in the Republican field, acted like a winner already by ignoring his opponents in an appearance at the Saddle Brook Veterans of Foreign Wars hall this morning. Instead, he aimed at the millionaire he expects the Democrats to send to the general election.</p>
        <p>''You've all seen that Jon Corzine is spending $40 million of his own money to pay for the Democrat  nomination,'' Mr. Franks said, borrowing the main theme of Mr. Corzine's Democratic rival, Jim Florio. Referring to Mr. Corzine's ambitious social agenda, Mr. Franks went on, ''Well, the only thing about Jon Corzine is that he could get to Washington and start spending your money.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, whose spending has been an issue in the race, devoted part of the weekend campaigning in black neighborhoods, whose turnout he needs to counter Mr. Florio's strength in South Jersey.</p>
        <p>He spent Saturday campaigning throughout Bergen County with Martin Luther King III, the son of the slain civil rights leader, vigorously working the crowd at the African-American Heritage Parade and Festival in Montclair, and exhorting a friendly throng to turn out on Primary Day.</p>
        <p>The noisy atmosphere seemed to imbue Mr. Corzine with a relaxed accessibility that softened his sometimes wooden approach to people earlier in this, his first political campaign. He embraced a woman in a white jogging suit after she said she was voting for him, and when Frances Spencer, 71, a retired sales clerk, blurted out that she would vote for him, he clasped her hands and planted a gallant kiss on them.</p>
        <p>At the Harrison Fest 2000 today, Mr. Corzine seemed slightly more subdued as he worked his way through a crowded street festival in Newark's old industrial suburb. Harrison is strongly pro-Corzine, or rather, anti-Florio, said Robert C. Janiszewski, the Hudson County executive, who campaigned with Mr. Corzine. County party members are still angry about the near annihilation of the Democratic Party at the polls after Mr. Florio hammered through a $2.8 billion tax increase as governor in 1991, he explained, and they did not want him back on the ballot.</p>
        <p>''I really don't think it's in the interests of the Democratic Party to spend the fall campaign defending Jim Florio's tax increases,'' Mr. Janiszewski said.</p>
        <p>Outspent by Mr. Corzine 20 to 1, Mr. Florio devoted part of his weekend engaged in the same dogged, high-energy personal campaigning that has marked his long career in New Jersey politics. He, too, paid special attention to minority voters over the weekend by worshiping today at the Tabernacle Baptist Church in Burlington City, comfortably inside the South Jersey political base that he arose from as a young congressman nearly 30 years ago. Then Mr. Florio headed north into the state's crowded suburbs, the heart of Mr. Corzine's support.</p>
        <p>''I'm going out to try to energize people, to try to mobilize people,'' the former governor said, bringing up the huge fund Mr. Corzine has pledged from his personal fortune for ''street money,'' to hire vans and pay staff members to bring groups of supporters to the polls on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''The big difference, of course, is that I'm not going to be able to spend $2.5 million on Election Day,'' Mr. Florio said. ''He's going to spend in one day to try to buy votes what I spent in my whole campaign. We will rely on volunteers.'' Mr. Corzine has put the amount of get-out-the-vote money he will spend on Primary Day at $2 million.</p>
        <p>Another Republican in the race, James W. Treffinger, the Essex County executive, spent today meeting with county election coordinators, evidently focusing on the mechanics of the process referred to as ''G.O.T.V.,'' for ''get out the vote.''</p>
        <p>State Senator William L. Gormley, a Republican from Atlantic County and the man who is likely to prove Mr. Franks's closest competition, spent five and a half hours on Saturday in an exhausting door-to-door trek through the Morris County towns of Montville, Hanover and Florham Park. He left his schedule today open for only a final rally with his campaign volunteers at the American Legion Post in Absecon.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Murray Sabrin, the most conservative of the four Republicans and arguably the undermost underdog, spent Saturday focused on two groups that are giving him his strongest support. He spoke before an antiabortion group in Totowa on Saturday and then met with the Shore Shot Pistol Club in Lakewood, whose members support his strong defense of gun ownership rights.</p>
        <p>The mad pace of the last weekend before the New Jersey primary was an expression of the importance the candidates attach to reaching individual voters, particularly if, as some analysts have predicted, the turnout on Tuesday is small.</p>
        <p>Lacking the millions Mr. Corzine spent on television advertisements, most of the other candidates have tried instead to shake hands with as many potential backers as possible. As the party activists that voters in primaries tend to be, the targets of this attention tended to take notice.</p>
        <p>''I'm stuck between Franks and Gormley,'' said Sam Ribarro, a retired salesman and Navy veteran of World War II, who went to hear Representative Franks at the V.F.W. hall here. Mr. Franks's House district lies several miles south of here, in Union County.</p>
        <p>''Gormley's good,'' Mr. Ribarro said, ''but I haven't seen him around here. We had a St. Paddy's Day, Franks was here. We had some other thing, he was there. And he's here today, so I'm leaning to him.''</p>
        <p>Sam Salierno, the master of ceremonies at the candidates brunch, agreed.</p>
        <p>''Bob Franks, forget about him being a politician,'' Mr. Salierno said. ''He's a person first. He's been coming around here since before he was even running for anything.''</p>
        <p>The Republican campaign has been notable for the absence of acrimony among the four candidates, in contrast to the venom that hangs in the air between Mr. Florio and Mr. Corzine. Lacking Mr. Corzine's money, the former governor has resorted to increasingly vitriolic attacks on his opponent and Mr. Corzine's supporters. When Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat, endorsed Mr. Corzine last week, the Florio campaign added up the contributions Mr. Corzine had given Mr. Schumer over the years and accused the senator of selling his support.</p>
        <p>And on Saturday, Mr. Corzine reacted bitterly to a mailing Mr. Florio's supporters sent to black neighborhoods accusing Mr. Corzine of profiting from modern-day slavery in Africa, through investments in Sudan that his former company, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, had helped manage. Today, Mr. Florio acknowledged that the Democrats would have to work at reconciliation when the votes were in, and he spoke with an uncharacteristic note of hurt at the tone the race had taken. ''What we will have to do is get together,'' he said as he left the church. ''This has not been a campaign I have been very comfortable with.''</p>
