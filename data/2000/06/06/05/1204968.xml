        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In a May 29 Arts pages article, the  playwright David Auburn recounted a fiercely negative reaction to a comment I jokingly made in a television interview regarding playwrighting. I said I looked forward to writing a play because I could just have people talk and not worry about plot.</p>
        <p>Although I'm just a screenwriter, I'm not so simple-minded as to think that playwrighting has nothing to do with narrative. I was a college theater major, and I've been going to the theater for more than 25 years.</p>

        <p>Although I'm just a screenwriter, I'm not so simple-minded as to think that playwrighting has nothing to do with narrative. I was a college theater major, and I've been going to the theater for more than 25 years.</p>
        <p>In theater, a writer rules. Film isn't considered a writer's medium. Screenwriters have little control over how a script is produced. My comment referred to a playwright's freedom to write a play in which people just talk if the writer so desires. Not all playwrights write with a strong narrative. Surely Samuel Beckett's ''Happy Days'' and ''Endgame'' are not driven by story.</p>
        <p>It's just plain silly that the gifted Mr. Auburn took the comment literally.</p>
