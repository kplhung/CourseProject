        <p>There will be a Round 2, after all.</p>
        <p>After uncertainty about the possible consequences, ABC will again pit the hottest show of the television season, ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' against CBS's much discussed and highly promising newcomer ''Survivor'' on Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>Against all expectations, CBS scored a coup last week when ''Survivor,'' its summer series about social interaction and survival skills on a remote island, did some real damage to ''Millionaire,'' ABC's most valuable property. In a stealth move, ABC had scheduled ''Millionaire'' on that Wednesday night just to derail the new series.</p>
        <p>''Survivor'' did remarkably well with young viewers, the audience ABC usually courts. And ''Millionaire,'' which was already being denigrated by some competitors for starting to skew old in its appeal, looked extremely top-heavy with older viewers when matched against ''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>That is certainly not the message ABC wants to send this summer just before it moves from a three night-a-week to a four-night schedule of ''Millionaire'' in the fall.</p>
        <p>If ABC had wanted to avoid making a decision about a second showdown with ''Survivor,'' it got no help from the New Jersey Devils. Only a sweep in the Stanley Cup hockey finals, being carried by ABC in prime time, would have eliminated the need for ABC to think about having Regis Philbin square off again against those folks dodging rats and snakes on CBS.</p>
        <p>But the Devils lost Game 2 to the Dallas Stars, and ABC knew the hockey series would last at least five games, pre-empting this Thursday's showing of ''Millionaire.''</p>
        <p>With an extra ''Millionaire'' on its hands, ABC could have chosen to play it on Wednesday at 8 to challenge the second episode of ''Survivor'' -- or it could have slid it to the safety of, say, Friday.</p>
        <p>But after weighing the risks involved if ''Millionaire'' fared even worse this week against ''Survivor,'' ABC still opted to meet the new enemy head on again.</p>
        <p>A week ago it was CBS that was most concerned about the outcome; now the pressure has shifted to ABC. As an executive at a competing network noted, any drop in the powerhouse status of ''Millionaire'' could have serious financial implications for ABC, which has charged advertisers huge prices for the show.</p>
        <p>ABC executives profess no more concern about the future of ''Millionaire'' than they did before ''Survivor'' arrived. And at least one interested party expressed nothing but warmth for the new competition.</p>
        <p>Mark Burnett, the executive producer of ''Survivor,'' said he received one especially welcome call amid many of congratulations. Michael Davies, the executive producer of ''Millionaire'' called to say, as Mr. Burnett put it, ''welcome to the hit club.''</p>
