        <p>Amid renewed pressure in the airline industry to consolidate, British Airways has held informal merger discussions with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, executives close to both companies said today.</p>
        <p>While the executives emphasized that the discussions are in the most preliminary stage -- one executive called them talks about talks -- it underscores a sense of urgency among airline operators to seek partners, in the hope of increasing profit in an industry where many companies, particularly in Europe, have seen margins erode.</p>
        <p>The informal discussions take place amid the proposed acquisition of US Airways by UAL, parent of United Airlines, for $4.3 billion and overtures from AMR, American Airlines' parent, to Northwest Airlines about combining their businesses. Those talks have adjourned, executives said. Northwest has made it clear that it would expect a high price, with the value of the UAL-US Airways deal as a starting point. AMR is said to be considering its next move.</p>
        <p>Whatever the state of discussions, many analysts say that the airline industry is on the verge of more consolidation, as a few big carriers move to get still bigger, carving out bigger chunks of the world's flight routes.</p>
        <p>Already, airlines in the United States and Europe have entered into a hodgepodge of alliances that allow passengers to book flights on member airlines and share frequent-flier programs. In fact, if British Airways was to merge with KLM, it would put several alliances into question. British Airways is a member of the Oneworld alliance with American, and KLM has an alliance with Northwest.</p>
        <p>British Airways tried to merge many of its functions with American in 1996, but regulators have blocked the proposed deal. KLM broke off its alliance with Alitalia in April. If British Airways were to merge with KLM, it might also take on KLM's alliance with Northwest. However, some analysts think that the combined company's relationship with Northwest would have to be severed to gain regulatory approval because the group would control too many trans-Atlantic flights.</p>
        <p>Still, some analysts think that a deal between British Airways and KLM would gain approval from regulators. British Airways has reported poor financial results in recent periods, with its 1999 earnings the worst since the airline was privatized. ''We believe British Airlines accepts that its European operations will destroy shareholder value until, and unless, European consolidation happens,'' Peter Hyde, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, wrote in a note to investors.</p>
        <p>European airlines that rely on traffic on the Continent have been especially hard hit. Low-cost carriers, mimicking the success of Southwest Airlines in the United States, have forced down profit margins, undercutting intercity prices by the big carriers that have run markedly higher than on similar-length routes in the United States. Hoping to avoid being left out of the low-cost segment, British Airways and KLM have created their own low-cost carriers. British Air spawned an airline called Go, and KLM created a discount carrier called Buzz.</p>
