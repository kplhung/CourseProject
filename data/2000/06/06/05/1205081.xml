        <p>A good Samaritan subdued a man who was trying to push a woman onto the subway tracks in Morningside Heights yesterday and held him until officers arrived, the police said.</p>
        <p>The suspect, Julio DeJesus, 36, was charged with attempted murder, said Lt. Dennis Cirillo, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>The attack occurred about 4:10 p.m. on the southbound platform of the B and C lines at 110th Street in Manhattan when Mr. DeJesus tried to push a 24-year-old woman onto the tracks, Lieutenant Cirillo said.</p>
        <p>It was not clear what his motives were or if he was mentally ill, or if a train was near, the lieutenant said.</p>
        <p>The man who intervened, whose name was not released by the police, saw the attack and grabbed Mr. DeJesus, Lieutenant Cirillo said. The woman was not hurt.</p>
        <p>A token clerk at the station, Martha A. Chase, said the man led Mr. DeJesus up the stairs from the platform and through the turnstile with his hand pinned behind his back, and told the clerk to call the police.</p>
        <p>While waiting for the police to arrive, the man pushed Mr. DeJesus to the floor and pinned both hands behind his back, Ms. Chase said.</p>
        <p>''Then -- this is the part I love -- he puts his heel on the guy's hands and lights up a Newport,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''They should do something really nice for that man,'' she added. She said he had a woman and two children with him.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeJesus, of Grant Avenue in the Bronx, was also charged with attempted assault and reckless endangerment, Lieutenant Cirillo said.</p>
