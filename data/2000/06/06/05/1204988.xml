        <p>Bruce Weber reviews one-act plays offered in Ensemble Studio Theater's Marathon 2000 festival: Cannibals by Heather Dundas; The Final Interrogation of Ceausescu's Dog by Warren Leight; Birth Marks by Leslie Caputo; Alien Boy by Will Scheffer and Proof by Jeff Reich; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Leslie Caputo's ''Birth Marks,'' which closes the first half of the third and final installment of Marathon 2000, the Ensemble Studio Theater's annual festival of new plays, has enough situational complexity to make you want a second act. As it opens, a young woman named Terry -- she's maybe 18 or 20 -- has just given birth to a baby in a hospital on the Lower East Side. Played by Jenna Lamia, she's blond, lovely, Irish Catholic and alone. Her husband, who is Hispanic, hasn't shown up at the hospital, and he never will.</p>
        <p>Instead she is visited by her disapproving, bigoted and spineless father (Martin Shakar), who brings letters from his wife to read to her, letters that begin, ''To my disgraced daughter.'' She is also visited by her husband's sister, Yvonne (Nicole Gomez), who is both a spitfire party girl and a genuinely concerned friend, and by her husband's brother, Luis (Ramon de Ocampo), a dopey kid who has been dispatched to find the missing spouse and failed his mission in spectacularly dunderheaded fashion.</p>

        <p>Leslie Caputo's ''Birth Marks,'' which closes the first half of the third and final installment of Marathon 2000, the Ensemble Studio Theater's annual festival of new plays, has enough situational complexity to make you want a second act. As it opens, a young woman named Terry -- she's maybe 18 or 20 -- has just given birth to a baby in a hospital on the Lower East Side. Played by Jenna Lamia, she's blond, lovely, Irish Catholic and alone. Her husband, who is Hispanic, hasn't shown up at the hospital, and he never will.</p>
        <p>Instead she is visited by her disapproving, bigoted and spineless father (Martin Shakar), who brings letters from his wife to read to her, letters that begin, ''To my disgraced daughter.'' She is also visited by her husband's sister, Yvonne (Nicole Gomez), who is both a spitfire party girl and a genuinely concerned friend, and by her husband's brother, Luis (Ramon de Ocampo), a dopey kid who has been dispatched to find the missing spouse and failed his mission in spectacularly dunderheaded fashion.</p>
        <p>The plot issue is what will happen to the baby, and the play could stand expansion to more fully simmer the emotional stew that is cooked up in a mere 40 minutes. But the pungency of this small play is in its rendering of the cross-cultural and cross-generational conflicts in a working-class pocket of the city.</p>
        <p>From the opening conversation, in which Terry's father speaks to his daughter with an Irish accent and Terry responds in New Yawkese -- ''her'' is pronounced ''huh'' -- the ingrained obstacles to every relationship in this play are painfully and realistically evident.</p>
        <p>The dialogue is written with a sure ear, no mean feat considering the vernacular variety, and all the actors, but particularly Ms. Lamia and Ms. Gomez, give their characters the sense that for all their will to connect, they're speaking in separate tongues. By the end, an entire neighborhood, its ethnic mix thrown together by economics and circumscribed by limited dreams, has been evoked by four people in a hospital room.</p>
        <p>''Birth Marks'' is the highlight among the five bite-size plays that make up the program, which runs through June 11. The others are less ambitious, though each has its moments to recommend.</p>
        <p>Even ''Proof,'' by Jeff Reich, the play that closes the evening by running bizarrely off the track of its initially comic premise, does have a great beginning. In it a professor of neuroscience at an undistinguished college takes out the frustration of a life of academic obscurity on a classroom full of first-year students. The scene takes the form of his opening lecture, and it is hilariously, farcically bitter, complete with a slide show in which all the slides are upside down. (You wouldn't think an upside-down goldfish would look so weirdly funny, but it does.)</p>
        <p>The professor, Nathan Simpson, is played with a delicious comic sense of self-loathing distress by Brad Bellamy. But alas the play doesn't know what to make of the situation it has wrought; it devolves into a windy confrontation between Simpson and his pompous mentor (Forest Compton).</p>
        <p>The other plays include ''The Final Interrogation of Ceausescu's Dog,'' by Warren Leight, the playwright's first work on a New York stage since his ''Side Man'' won the Tony Award for best play last year. An amusing trifle, it depicts the canine companion of the deposed Romanian dictator being questioned by a suddenly liberated citizen. His efforts to crack the dog's smugly privileged demeanor cause him no end of frustration, which Ean Sheehy does a nice job of letting bubble up until he cracks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sheehy has the thankless role, here, however: as the dog, Alexander R. Scott, dressed in a houndstooth jacket and speaking in an Eastern European-accented pidgin English, is the star of the show. ''I am simple dog,'' he says, whenever he's unmoved to respond, an anthropomorphism that makes you giggle every time.</p>
        <p>''Alien Boy,'' by Will Scheffer, is a monologue about a 13-year-old coming to recognize his homosexuality. It has a vivid central anecdote -- the confused boy writes to a psychiatrist, picked out of the phone book, pleading for treatment -- and the performance, by David Greenspan, is an idiosyncratic one, well thought out both physically and verbally. But the play itself has too many familiar signposts -- mother issues, ''The Boys in the Band'' -- not to feel a bit shopworn.</p>
        <p>The play that opens the evening, ''Cannibals'' by Heather Dundas, is a comic reverie about Jane, a suburban mother who wonders how she got that way. ''Here's what I don't understand,'' she says, stepping out from behind the wheel of her car, in which she's driving her clamorous two children and their friends to school. ''Ten years ago I was a bisexual living in New Orleans.''</p>
        <p>In scenes that flip back and forth between Jane's stressed daydreams and the reality of her stressed morning, she persuasively reveals the understandable conflict between what her life might have been and what it is. The script is detailed enough to make Jane a real character, and in the lead role, Diana LaMar is singular enough to rouse a potentially hackneyed circumstance to the level of a sympathetic predicament.</p>
        <p>The switchbacks are directed with comic efficiency by India Cooper, even if the final image, Jane drawing a line down the front of her face with lipstick, is on the heavy-handed side. The main difficulty with the play is in its use of full-grown actors as 7-year-olds and a 3-year-old. Despite their ardent efforts here, the actors come across as such ill-assigned performers generally do, not as children but mentally deficient adults.</p>
