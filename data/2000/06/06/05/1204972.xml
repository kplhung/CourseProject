        <p>THE tennis star Andre Agassi once asserted in advertising for Canon EOS Rebel cameras that ''image is everything.'' Now, in a campaign for the Twinlab line of products like vitamins and nutritional supplements, he seems willing to consider that substance may be as important as style.</p>
        <p>Agassi and his recent comeback, which included winning three of the last four Grand Slam tennis events, are the focus of the campaign, by Hanft Byrne Raboy &amp; Partners in New York. The budget is estimated at $25 million, the largest ever for the Twinlab Corporation.</p>
        <p>The ads, scheduled to begin appearing on Friday, will introduce a theme -- ''Answers. For life.'' -- that seeks to link Agassi's performance with the use of Twinlab products in his training regimen.</p>
        <p>''Here's a celebrity who actually uses our products and has become a fitter, stronger player,'' said Neil Blechman, executive vice president at Twinlab in Hauppuage, N.Y. ''It's a unique opportunity for our company.''</p>
        <p>Twinlab's hiring of Agassi, who signed a multiyear contract with undisclosed financial terms, is emblematic of the continued strong appeal of celebrity endorsements as a marketing tactic. Indeed, in the category in which Twinlab competes, there are almost as many pitchstars as, to quote an old saying, Carter's has little liver pills.</p>
        <p>Agassi will face off against actors including Hector Elizondo, who promotes the Quanterra line of herbal supplements sold by Warner-Lambert, which is being acquired by Pfizer, and Annie Potts, who peddles a similar product line for One-A-Day, sold by Bayer.</p>
        <p>In deciding whether to sign celebrity athletes, marketers are increasingly looking for proven, long-term performance rather than one-time feats like, say, winning a Super Bowl or a World Series. By that standard, Agassi -- who has also worked for consumer marketers like Nike and PepsiCo in addition to Canon -- would qualify as endorser material.</p>
        <p>Centering campaigns on athletes ''could either be home runs or crash and burn quickly,'' said Adam Hanft, managing partner and president at Hanft Byrne.</p>
        <p>''Consumers have very sophisticated antennae to distinguish between genuine passion for a product and expediency,'' he added. ''The ones who are doing it for the money are so transparent.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanft said he believed that Agassi's appeal was enhanced by his story of rising to the top of the tennis world, falling to a ranking of 141st and then rising again, because ''what he represents is more aspirational for the majority of people.''</p>
        <p>''Andre is the perfect bridge from where we were to where we want to go,'' he added, referring to a goal of emphasizing the range of Twinlab vitamins, minerals and herbal products rather than just concentrating on sports nutrition items favored by body builders.</p>
        <p>The campaign includes television and radio commercials, print advertisements, Internet marketing, a sweepstakes and store displays and posters. The voice of Agassi's trainer, Gil Reyes, who helped Agassi and Twinlab hook up, is heard in the radio spots.</p>
        <p>In one television commercial, Agassi recounts his comeback to first as an announcer declares, ''When you're ready to look out for No. 1, Twinlab will show you how.''</p>
        <p>A second television spot intercuts scenes of Agassi playing tennis with footage from a program on ABC depicting him playing in 1974. An interviewer -- the former baseball star Don Drysdale -- asks, ''You want to be a tennis player when you get big?'' Young Agassi replies, ''Yes.''</p>
        <p>The second spot ends with Drysdale asking, ''Do you know how old you are?'' Young Agassi replies, ''Six.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes, though, when it comes to hiring athletes as endorsers, a funny thing can happen on the way to the stadium. Promotional materials for the campaign describe how its start is meant to coincide with the French Open, ''where Agassi is the No. 1 seed and defending champion.'' But last Thursday, Agassi lost in a second-round match to a player ranked 65th, Karol Kucera.</p>
        <p>Agassi's defeat occurred just before Mr. Blechman's telephone interview for this column. Told that Agassi had lost, Mr. Blechman said, ''I didn't think he was playing today.'' After a pause, he added: ''This is really off the cuff, but even if he doesn't win the title, Andre's resurgence in the past two years is the real story. As long as he continues to be at the top of his game, we're confident he will be a major asset to the brand in the marketplace.</p>
        <p>''We can't wait till he plays in New York,'' Mr. Blechman said, referring to the United States Open.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanft's reaction to Agassi's shocking shortfall at the French Open, attributed to a blistered right toe, was more puckish.</p>
        <p>''We have 'Answers. For life,' '' Mr. Hanft said, laughing, ''but not 'Answers. For feet.' ''</p>
