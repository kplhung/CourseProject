        <p>President Clinton and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia concluded two days of talks today with mutual praise, but without narrowing the differences over the national missile defense system the United States wants to build.</p>
        <p>The summit meeting did produce two other narrow but significant agreements. One was an undertaking by the United States and Russia each to destroy 34 metric tons (about 75,000 pounds) of weapons-grade plutonium, enough to make tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. The other called for a joint center in Moscow to share early warnings about missile launching, a center that would be the first permanent American-Russia military operation.</p>
        <p>Over all, senior administration officials described the atmosphere between the lame-duck American president and the new Russian president as correct and businesslike, though not necessarily warm. That was evident at their news conference.</p>
        <p>Although the two presidents shook hands as they entered the hall, and Mr. Clinton gently nudged Mr. Putin to pose with him for the cameras afterward, they did not look or smile at each other during their opening statements or while answering questions.</p>
        <p>The two men had met twice before, in 1999 when Mr. Putin was prime minister, but this was their first meeting since the Russian was elected president in March. And although they had a range of issues on their agenda -- including Russia's struggle to reform its economy and its unresolved war in Chechnya -- arms control dominated their talks.</p>
        <p>Seeking to temper expectations, senior administration officials had said before the trip that there would not be a substantial breakthrough on the contentious question of a national missile defense.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton is committed to decide before the end of his administration whether to move forward with a limited missile defense system against the possibility that a ''rogue state'' like North Korea might develop a missile able to reach the United States. Russia says the project would undermine the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, a cornerstone of strategic arms controls, and unleash a new arms race. The proposed American system is also opposed by China, and the European allies have expressed concern.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin evidently felt no urgency to change his position.</p>
        <p>He made that clear during the news conference, which was held in the grand, gilt-trimmed St. George's Hall in the recently renovated czarist-era Grand Palace of the Kremlin. While acknowledging that there was ''a commonality'' in foreseeing the possibility of unspecified new threats, Mr. Putin said, ''We're against having a cure which is worse than the disease.''</p>
        <p>The two sides agreed to a joint statement pledging to continue talks on further cuts in strategic nuclear weapons and terming the ABM treaty the ''cornerstone'' of global strategic security. The statement called on experts from both sides to prepare a joint report on how to tackle new threats to strategic stability.</p>
        <p>But briefing reporters after the press conference, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott stressed that Mr. Putin had not softened his position.</p>
        <p>''President Putin made absolutely clear to President Clinton that Russia continues to oppose the changes to the ABM treaty that the United States has proposed since last September,'' Mr. Talbott said. He said Russia believed that the anti-missile plan ''will undermine strategic stability, threaten Russia's strategic deterrent and provoke a new arms race.''</p>
        <p>At the news conference, Mr. Putin  insisted that he was willing to continue working on the issue, if necessary, with the next American president. ''We know that today, in the United States, there is a campaign ongoing,'' he said, adding that he was familiar with the programs of the two main candidates. ''No matter who gets to be president, we're willing to go forward.''</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Clinton has only eight more months in office, that in itself does not necessarily preclude  progress on arms control or United States-Russian relations. President Reagan spent a large part of 1988, his last year in office, pressing for improvements in Washington's relations with Moscow and pushing arms control agreements. And just two weeks before Mr. Clinton's inauguration, President Bush signed the Start II treaty, calling for the most significant rollback yet in the formidable nuclear arsenal of the cold war.</p>
        <p>Officials said that during their eight hours of talks over two days, Mr. Putin spoke some English, and each leader displayed a readiness to hear the other out. But the exchanges lacked the first-name familiarity that characterized the relationship between Mr. Clinton and Boris N. Yeltsin, the former president, where it was always ''Boris'' and ''Bill.''</p>
        <p>One American in the delegation said of Mr. Putin: ''You can see he is not a warm person; he's a cold fish. People say he's a control freak.'' But the official pointed out that on arms control issues, that may not be bad.</p>
        <p>Asked how they would describe each other's personalities and leadership styles, Mr. Putin said of Mr. Clinton, ''He's a very experienced politician.''</p>
        <p>''In my mind, we've established now not only good business ties, but also personal relations,'' he said. ''For me, President Clinton is a person who is a very comfortable and pleasant partner in negotiations.''</p>
        <p>''I think that if everyone behaves the way President Clinton has behaved, not trying to find dead ends and problems, but to seek ways of moving ahead, I think between us in the future our relations really will be successful.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton was even more formal in his assessment of Mr. Putin, saying: ''If you want to know what my personal assessment is, I think he is fully capable of building a prosperous and strong Russia while preserving freedom, pluralism and the rule of law. It's a big challenge. I think he's fully capable of doing it.''</p>
        <p>The agreement on the disposal of some 34 tons of plutonium would help prevent the material from being used for weapons, though the financing of the Russian effort remains uncertain. The joint military center is intended to help both nations avoid an accidental missile launching.</p>
        <p>In the summit meeting, Mr. Clinton raised other areas of contention besides missile defense. He urged Mr. Putin to seek a political settlement to end Russia's eight-month-long military offensive against rebels in Chechnya and to allow international monitors to investigate charges of human rights violations in the region.</p>
        <p>And he called on the Russian leader to protect the rights of a free press. Earlier this spring, Mr. Putin ordered an armed raid on Media-MOST, a major communications company that had been critical of the Kremlin. The invasion was officially described as a tax raid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton underscored his message by giving an interview to Echo Moskvy, a radio station owned by Media-MOST.</p>
        <p>The joint Kremlin news conference was also an occasion to announce the agreements that had been reached. The two presidents sat at a long gilt-trimmed white table with two sets of pens as an overpowering, disembodied voice filled the vast 40-foot-ceilinged hall relating in both Russian and English each of the agreements and statements.</p>
        <p>The voice was so powerful that Mr. Clinton and several members of his delegation -- including the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger; Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson -- could not stop themselves from smiling. Mr. Putin did not smile.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton also indulged in a bit of sightseeing, visiting the imposing new Christ the Savior Cathedral on the Moscow River embankment near the Kremlin.</p>
