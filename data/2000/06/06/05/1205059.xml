        <p>MANHATTAN: PAINTERS' STRIKE -- The group representing management in the New York City painters' union strike has rejected a request to return to the bargaining table, officials said yesterday. The union, the International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades of District Council 9, went on strike Wednesday after rejecting a contract that would have provided a 13 percent increase in total compensation over three years. In addition, the agreement would have established a new local union with a lower wage and benefits scale in hopes of winning back work being lost to nonunion painters.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: UNION DISPUTE -- The National Labor Relations Board has charged the owner of a large Brooklyn office building with forcing janitors to join a union that they had not chosen. Last week, the labor board charged Muss Development, owner of Brooklyn Renaissance Plaza, with committing an unfair labor practice by pressuring 31 janitors to join the United Construction Trades and Industrial Employees International Union. Muss denies any wrongdoing. The building's janitors have been on strike since May 16, saying Muss prevented them from joining another union.</p>

        <p>EAST HAMPTON: VOTE ON SPRAWL -- To slow what officials call a growing problem of suburban sprawl, the town board has approved a six-month moratorium on subdividing large parcels of land. Officials say 900 houses are being built in the town every year, leading to crowded classrooms, more traffic and less open space. The moratorium, which was approved in a unanimous vote on Friday, prohibits areas of 10 acres or more from being subdivided for development.</p>

        <p>STAMFORD: VIRUS TEST -- The state's Department of Environmental Protection has begun trapping mosquitoes in lower Fairfield and New Haven Counties to test for the West Nile strain of the encephalitis virus. Last fall, at least seven New Yorkers were killed by complications from the virus. Infected birds were found in Connecticut last fall, but since November, the virus has been found only in a hawk in Westchester County, N.Y., and in a few mosquitoes in Queens, N.Y.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: GAMBLING STUDY -- White professionals between the ages of 25 and 44 are a major part of the gambling market throughout the country and in eastern Connecticut, according to an annual study by an international banking firm. The study found that gamblers tended to have more education than the national average. And gambling is not just a male vice, according to Bear, Stearns &amp; Company's North American Gaming Almanac 2000. The study found that single women were as likely to gamble as single men.</p>

        <p>MANVILLE: ENDANGERED FLOOD PLAN -- A plan to buy at least 42 homes damaged by Tropical Storm Floyd may have to be scrapped because the borough in Somerset County cannot provide matching funds for a federal grant. Borough officials say they do not have the $1.6 million needed to add to the $5 million federal grant that would pay for homes in the Lost Valley section. A bill that would create a $50 million fund to help communities meet their part of the requirement is being considered by the state Legislature.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: BEAR CAPTURED -- A 200-pound black bear was captured in Trenton early Saturday, about the same time as three bear sightings were reported in nearby Ewing. A man walking his dog in Trenton's West Ward about 1:30 a.m. saw the bear and called the police, who chased it for two hours before it climbed a tree. State wildlife officials eventually shot the bear with a tranquilizer gun, roped it and lowered it to the ground. It was taken into Warren County, where it was released on state property. Bears have been popping up around New Jersey in increasing numbers. In April, three were struck by cars in northern New Jersey in one day, and in May a bear bit a camper's sleeping bag at the Allamuchy Reservation.</p>
