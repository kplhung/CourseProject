        <p>EVER since the term ''clicks and mortar'' first made the rounds last year, traditional retailers have repeated the phrase with mind-numbing regularity, vowing to anyone within earshot that by integrating their Web operations into their physical stores they would eventually bury the Internet-only merchants.</p>
        <p>So one might forgive the tax lawyers of some of these traditional retailers for being slightly confused. Even as these companies preach the gospel of Internet integration to the public, some of the best-known merchants are telling government regulators that their Internet and physical-world operations are distinct and separate businesses -- and therefore should enjoy the tax advantages of maintaining separate operations.</p>
        <p>Those advantages are sizable. Like catalog companies, Internet-only businesses can sell to customers in any state but are required to collect sales tax only in the states where they have a physical presence -- a company headquarters, for instance, or warehouse. For Web merchants, the rules regarding physical presence -- or nexus, in tax parlance -- can also be set in motion in states where the merchants operate Internet server computers, or even backup servers.</p>
        <p>But traditional retailers have a problem. If they integrate their physical stores and their Internet operations, they run the risk of causing a nexus in every state where they have a store and must then collect a sales tax in that state -- even for sales on the Internet. And the more their stores act as agents for the Web sites -- by accepting merchandise returns in their stores for purchases made on the Web, for example, or promoting their Internet sites within the bricks-and-mortar stores -- the greater the chances that states will require them to collect sales tax.</p>
        <p>When these merchants do charge sales tax, not only do they often lose price battles against pure e-tailers; they must also invest in high-price tax software, so they can calculate, collect and then disburse sales taxes for nearly every purchase.</p>
        <p>Bricks-and-mortar retailers, of course, are fighting the tax codes with every nickel of lobbying money they can scrape together, saying that tax laws unfairly favor Internet retailers. And despite the fact that the House recently voted to extend a moratorium on new Internet taxes, the earthbound retailers are hopeful that the Senate will modify the legislation so that all Web merchants could be required to collect state sales taxes.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, traditional retailers are approaching Internet sales taxes in widely varying ways. Some, like Wal-Mart Stores and the bookseller Borders, are being particularly aggressive. In both cases, the Web sites charge sales tax only in the few states where the companies have actual Internet operations -- even though they allow goods bought on the Web to be returned to all of their stores and even though they promote their sites within the stores.</p>
        <p>Some tax analysts say such an approach is pushing the boundaries of tax law in some states, even if a separate corporate division is handling the dot-com side of the business. But according to Rich Fahle, a Borders spokesman, ''Every lawyer we've spoken to said we're legally in the clear. And our competitors aren't charging tax online either, so that would put us at a serious competitive disadvantage.''</p>
        <p>Because Borders' big competitor, Barnes &amp; Noble, has spun off its dot-com operations into a separate company, Barnesandnoble .com's sales tax practices are similar to Amazon.com's and other pure Internet retailers.</p>
        <p>One industry executive, said Wal-Mart might be inviting a court case -- something he said he would welcome, ''so we could all get some clarity on this issue and maybe level the playing field'' for non-Internet companies.</p>
        <p>Les Copeland, a Wal-Mart spokesman, declined to ''speak to someone else's theory.''</p>
        <p>''When we approached this,'' Mr. Copeland said, ''we just looked at how other dot-com companies were structured, and we set up Wal-Mart.com similar to the other dot-com companies.'' He said that, to keep things at arm's length, Wal-Mart stores serve as a contractor to Wal-Mart.com, when it comes to accepting product returns from the Web site's customers.</p>
        <p>Other retailers that have set up separate companies for their online stores are taking a more conservative approach. Kmart, which, in league with Softbank Venture Partners, founded Bluelight.com as a separate business, is one example.</p>
        <p>''Are we charging taxes? Absolutely,'' said Mark H. Goldstein, Bluelight's chief executive. ''Did we buy an expensive software package to do that? Absolutely. Do we think it's right? Absolutely not.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldstein said the company might become more aggressive about taxes later this year, ''when we can focus on this issue more clearly and directly.'' But for now, ''there are municipalities that are counting on this money,'' he said. ''We don't want to be the lightening rod for holding back revenues. We don't want to do anything that's illegal. And we don't want to alienate communities where Kmart has stores.''</p>
        <p>And although charging sales tax can put his company at a pricing disadvantage, Mr. Goldstein said that gap was narrowing because Internet-only retailers have been slowly raising their prices in an effort to make a profit. ''It was a larger issue when the dot-coms were being subsidized'' by venture capitalists, he said. ''That's disappearing quickly.''</p>
        <p>For other traditional retailers, the advantages of integrating business units far outweigh the sales tax hit. ''Spinning off a piece of the company just detracts from the overall business,'' said Ken Weil, vice president of new media for Victoria's Secret, a unit of the Limited Inc. ''I recently talked to one company that separated the businesses,'' Mr. Weil said. ''They put their U.R.L. on the shopping bag in stores, and the stores division wanted to charge the Internet division. They got bogged down in a channel conflict.''</p>
        <p>Victoria's Secret charges sales tax on its Web site in any state that has a sales tax.</p>
        <p>And so far, Mr. Weil said, there is no evidence that Victoria's Secret is rankling consumers who might have expected tax-free Internet shopping. ''We get hundreds of customer service contacts a week,'' he said, ''and taxation never comes up.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weil acknowledged that because his site sells only goods bearing the Victoria's  Secret brand, customers are essentially unable to engage in price-comparison shopping, as happens with many other kinds of retailing sites. But according to a recent report by Jupiter Communications, an Internet research firm, even among goods that consumers can buy from multiple retailers, sales tax is less an issue than many retailers may believe.</p>
        <p>In a survey of 1,600 online shoppers, Jupiter found that when shopping for goods priced $50 or less, only 29 percent of respondents said they would consider rejecting the purchase if the retailer charged sales tax. That number climbed to 41 percent for goods over $100.</p>
        <p>So from a tax standpoint, companies should avoid integrating their Internet and existing retail operations ''only if they're selling high-priced, commodity products, like computers,'' said Ken Cassar, a Jupiter analyst. ''Otherwise, the opportunities for serving customers and promoting the site are big enough that even if you do have to charge tax, they're well worth it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cassar noted that 42 percent of those surveyed said that, if given the option, they would want to return products purchased online to the Web site's affiliated store -- an option that, for most retailers, includes charging a sales tax to Internet customers.</p>
        <p>That logic is not lost on Kent Anderson, president of Macy's.com, which tightly integrates the Web site and physical stores, in areas like inventory management and marketing. And it charges sales tax in any state with Web operations or Macy stores, which are owned by Federated Department Stores.</p>
        <p>''We just completed some research which told us that the ability to take merchandise back to the store is a key element for our customers,'' he said. ''It came out as number one or two in almost every customer feedback session.''</p>
        <p>And sales tax? ''It was not an issue,'' Mr. Anderson said.</p>
