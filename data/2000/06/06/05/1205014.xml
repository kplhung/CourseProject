        <p>Humanitarian disasters have emerged as  the most complex challenges facing American foreign policy. There has been strenuous debate over whether America should get involved when there is famine in Somalia or Sudan, genocide in Rwanda, mass killings in East Timor or a refugee exodus  in Kosovo. What gets less attention is the question  of how to take effective action when we do get involved. An internal State Department report  provides an unusually frank assessment of  why American action has sometimes been slow or ineffective.</p>
        <p>The study was directed by Morton Halperin, head of the policy planning staff at the State Department, and James Michel, counselor to the Agency for International Development. It examines how Washington responded to three man-made humanitarian disasters -- stemming from armed conflicts in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Sudan -- and one natural disaster, Hurricane Mitch in Central America. Although the report finds much to applaud, it is also a tale of poor coordination, missions being duplicated or falling through the cracks, and confusion inside the administration and the private humanitarian groups that sometimes cannot be sure with which agency to work. Confusion over which part of the government was leading the response to Hurricane Mitch, for example, led to delays in assessing the damage and getting aid to Central America.  Most important, at many times when American policy was made, no one was present to remind officials of the humanitarian consequences.</p>

        <p>Humanitarian disasters have emerged as  the most complex challenges facing American foreign policy. There has been strenuous debate over whether America should get involved when there is famine in Somalia or Sudan, genocide in Rwanda, mass killings in East Timor or a refugee exodus  in Kosovo. What gets less attention is the question  of how to take effective action when we do get involved. An internal State Department report  provides an unusually frank assessment of  why American action has sometimes been slow or ineffective.</p>
        <p>The study was directed by Morton Halperin, head of the policy planning staff at the State Department, and James Michel, counselor to the Agency for International Development. It examines how Washington responded to three man-made humanitarian disasters -- stemming from armed conflicts in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Sudan -- and one natural disaster, Hurricane Mitch in Central America. Although the report finds much to applaud, it is also a tale of poor coordination, missions being duplicated or falling through the cracks, and confusion inside the administration and the private humanitarian groups that sometimes cannot be sure with which agency to work. Confusion over which part of the government was leading the response to Hurricane Mitch, for example, led to delays in assessing the damage and getting aid to Central America.  Most important, at many times when American policy was made, no one was present to remind officials of the humanitarian consequences.</p>
        <p>The report can be read as a plea for establishing a single office to coordinate humanitarian assistance, with a chief who would participate in high-level meetings the next time we are faced with a Kosovo or Sudan. This is an eminently sensible recommendation for the next administration, which is sure to find itself wrestling with new famines, hurricanes and wars.</p>
        <p>The authors of this unclassified assessment have stirred grumbling inside the State Department for their public bluntness, especially because their criticisms have received most of the attention. But they could have hoped for little impact if they had kept their views classified, and the issue is one that deserves airing. Mr. Halperin and Mr. Michel have performed a service by identifying the shortcomings in America's humanitarian programs, and by allowing the public to know.</p>
