        <p>Eleven years after China turned its tanks and troops against student protesters in Tiananmen Square, more than 30,000 people gathered at a candlelight vigil here today to remember the doomed democracy movement.</p>
        <p>This year's ceremony drew far fewer people than last year's, when a crowd of 70,000 packed Victoria Park to mark the 10th anniversary of the massacre.</p>
        <p>Three years after Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese sovereignty, Tiananmen Square is no longer the emotional touchstone it once was. But as the only public commemoration on Chinese soil, the vigil is still remarkable for seeming so routine.</p>
        <p>''Eleven years ago, the Chinese government was corrupt,'' said Ang Chi-peng, who works in a trading firm. ''Eleven years later, the Chinese government is still corrupt. We have to keep coming out and saying that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ang, 51, has attended the vigil every year since 1989, when more than a million people poured into the streets to protest the violent crackdown in Beijing on the night of June 3-4. This year, he brought his 12-year-old daughter to witness Hong Kong's annual assertion of free expression.  ''Hong Kong is a political display window for China,'' Mr. Ang said. ''They allow things to happen here, but not anywhere else in China.''</p>
        <p>The police presence was light on this stifling evening as the crowd sang songs and waved softly flickering candles under a crescent moon. Giant screens at either end of the park replayed images of tanks rolling through Tiananmen Square as the sound of machine-gun fire echoed from loudspeakers.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in China, security forces fanned out to ensure that the anniversary passed without notice. In Beijing, the police arrested an activist in Tiananmen Square as he tried to scatter banners recalling the crackdown. The man, Shen Zhidao, was arrested in the square last year when he opened an umbrella covered with anti-government slogans.</p>
        <p>On Saturday night, the police broke up memorial services for the victims of the massacre in Beijing and Xian, said the Information Center of Human Rights and Democracy, a Hong Kong-based rights group. The group also said that 50 dissidents in four cities had begun a 24-hour hunger strike to honor the victims and to demand that the Chinese government reassess the crackdown.</p>
        <p>In Hong Kong, however, the anger toward Beijing has clearly ebbed. An annual survey released by the University of Hong Kong showed that  support for the group organizing the vigil had fallen to a record low -- 49 percent of those polled. In last year's survey, 56 percent of people polled said they supported the group, the Alliance in Support of Patriotic and Democratic Movement in China.</p>
        <p>In a statement, the alliance said, ''Under heavy political pressure, some people have quietly withdrawn, some people's hot blood has run cold, and some people have even betrayed their conscience by defending the massacre.''</p>
        <p>To compensate for the fading memory of Tiananmen Square, the vigil's organizers concentrated their efforts on young people. The theme was ''passing the torch of democracy'' to a new generation.</p>
        <p>Among adults here today, the subject of China's economic ties with the outside world came up repeatedly. T. C. Leung, a hotel worker, said that China's campaign to join the World Trade Organization and to establish normal trade relations with the United States would foster a new democratic movement in the country.</p>
        <p>A 44-year-old teacher nearby agreed. ''China wants to be accepted into the global economy, so it will unconsciously accept the rules of the game,'' said the woman, who would gave her name only as Au. ''The rules are set by democratic countries.''</p>
