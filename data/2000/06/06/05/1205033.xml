        <p>Goaltending and special teams are the basic ingredients for success in the playoffs, a claim made over the years by coaches and players with several championship rings. That was the first thing cited by Devils Coach Larry Robinson, who has seven championship rings as a player and coach, before this postseason. His Devils are justifying his claim in the Stanley Cup finals.</p>
        <p>Thanks to their special teams, the Devils took a two-games-to-one lead over the Dallas Stars with a 2-1 victory in Game 3 here Saturday night. The Devils killed three of the Stars' four power plays,  including a five-on-three situation for 49 seconds at a critical time in the first period. They also killed a delay-of-game penalty on Martin Brodeur with 4 minutes 15 seconds left in the game, which many considered the goaltender's best performance in this series.</p>

        <p>Goaltending and special teams are the basic ingredients for success in the playoffs, a claim made over the years by coaches and players with several championship rings. That was the first thing cited by Devils Coach Larry Robinson, who has seven championship rings as a player and coach, before this postseason. His Devils are justifying his claim in the Stanley Cup finals.</p>
        <p>Thanks to their special teams, the Devils took a two-games-to-one lead over the Dallas Stars with a 2-1 victory in Game 3 here Saturday night. The Devils killed three of the Stars' four power plays,  including a five-on-three situation for 49 seconds at a critical time in the first period. They also killed a delay-of-game penalty on Martin Brodeur with 4 minutes 15 seconds left in the game, which many considered the goaltender's best performance in this series.</p>
        <p>''Our penalty killers won the game for us,'' said Petr Sykora, whose power-play goal with 7:33 left in the second period -- a blistering shot from the slot off a pass from Jason Arnott, who scored the Devils' first goal -- was his third game-winner in the playoffs. It was the 12th power-play goal in 62 attempts in the playoffs for the Devils and the ninth for Sykora.</p>
        <p>Robinson attributed the success of killing Dallas's two-man advantage to the strategy of keeping the puck out of their zone. With Scott Stevens, Scott Niedermayer and John Madden leading the way, the penalty killers shut down Brett Hull and Mike Modano, two of the game's most deadly snipers.</p>
        <p>''Any shot from the outside, it's Marty's,'' said Madden, the best penalty killer among the Devils' forwards. ''You want a shot your goalie can see,'' he said, referring to Brodeur. ''You don't want a shot from the middle because it can be tipped or deflected.''</p>
        <p>Niedermayer, who is usually the third defenseman on the penalty-killing unit after Stevens and Ken Daneyko, said of killing the penalty to Brodeur: ''That's a huge part of the game when you're up a goal and they have a two-minute power play. Our P.K. has done a great job for us in the playoffs and all year long.''</p>
        <p>Just as in the regular season, the Devils' penalty killers have been the best in the playoffs. They killed 13 of Florida's 14 power plays in the first round, and all 20 of Toronto's power plays in the second round. When they reached the Eastern Conference finals against Philadelphia, the Devils thwarted 15 of the Flyers' 17 power plays to reach the finals.</p>
        <p>The Devils are two victories from their second Stanley Cup for other reasons, too: Stevens's crunching hits and brilliant play by several forwards. Throw in a tirade by Robinson at precisely the right time -- after three straight losses to the Flyers in the conference finals -- and the Devils are threatening to dethrone the defending champions in the four-of-seven-game cup finals.</p>
        <p>History is now on the side of the Devils, who have been the better team in this series. In the 21 times the Stanley Cup finals were tied at 1-1 after the first two games, the winner of Game 3 captured the trophy on all but three occasions.</p>
        <p>The Devils' hope that youth and exuberance would prevail over experience is starting to materialize. The Stars had difficulty keeping up with the Devils' speed on Saturday night, when their age showed for the first time in this series.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we can use being tired as an excuse,'' said Kirk Muller of the Stars, who, like the Devils, went through a grueling seven-game series in the conference finals. ''You are fighting for every inch out there, and there is no space. But I think we still have enough left in the tank.''</p>
        <p>On a day Robinson kept his players off the ice, more than half a dozen players refused to admit that they had the edge over the Stars in the finals, not even after they handed the Stars their second loss in 11 playoff games at Reunion Arena.</p>
        <p>''You cannot think you're better and get comfortable,'' said Bobby Holik, whose team is 8-2 on the road. ''You cannot for a moment think that, because they can come at you on the next shift. They have a lot of experience and have responded to pressure before.''</p>
