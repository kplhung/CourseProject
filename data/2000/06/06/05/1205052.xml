        <p>Seeking to lower expectations, Clinton administration officials had insisted that two days of talks with President Vladimir V. Putin should not be viewed as an arms control summit meeting. But they were.</p>
        <p>The main purpose was to soften the Kremlin's resistance to American plans for a limited missile defense and to pave the way for a new arms control framework by the end of the Clinton presidency.</p>
        <p>The meetings, however, failed to produce progress on either count, and the prospects for a breakthrough on Mr. Clinton's watch seem as dim as ever.</p>
        <p>There are several reasons the Clinton administration approached the summit meeting with a sense of urgency. Unlike the Reagan or Bush administrations, the Clinton administration has yet to negotiate a landmark accord on strategic arms, and it is eager to add to its legacy.</p>
        <p>The pressure also comes from the Clinton administration's schedule for deploying an antimissile system. Its goal is to install 20 interceptors and build a large battle-management radar in Alaska by 2005, a defense system the White House insists is needed against a potential North Korean threat.</p>
        <p>To meet that deadline, Mr. Clinton needs to give the go-ahead for at least some of the work by the end of year. And unless the Russians drop their objections and agree to modify the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty to allow a limited defense, President Clinton will have to consider withdrawing from the accord.</p>
        <p>That would not only create a confrontation with Moscow, but it would also seriously fray Washington's relations with its allies in Western Europe, who are nervous that the American missile-defense program will undermine the existing framework of arms agreements and set off a new arms race with Russia and China, and perhaps even new nuclear states like India and Pakistan.</p>
        <p>Despite some modest shifts in the Russian positions, however, the fundamental disagreements remain.</p>
        <p>''President Putin made absolutely clear to President Clinton that Russia continues to oppose changes to the ABM treaty that the United States has proposed,'' said Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state.</p>
        <p>The two sides did make some headway, agreeing on guidelines, grandly called the ''principles of strategic stability,'' for future talks.</p>
        <p>The guidelines take note of the emerging missile threat and allude to the possibility of amending the accord, steps American officials billed as an indication that Moscow is beginning to take account of Washington's worries about the potential missile abilities of North Korea and Iran, even if the Kremlin believes that those fears are exaggerated.</p>
        <p>The United States and Russia also signed two secondary, but noteworthy, agreements.</p>
        <p>One requires each side to dispose of 34 tons of weapons-grade plutonium during the next 20 years. While 34 tons is enough to make thousands of warheads, it represents one-fourth of the Russia's military stockpile. The disposal would not take place unless industrialized nations underwrite the $1.75 billion cost to carry out the program in Russia, a contribution yet to be arranged.</p>
        <p>Another accord would set up a Moscow-based center where the United States and Russia would exchange information on missile launchings. The purpose is to help the Russians compensate for gaps in their system of early-warning radars and reduce the chance that they might launch missiles on a false alert.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Clinton and Mr. Putin signed the accords with great fanfare, that did not mask their deeper dispute over missile defenses.</p>
        <p>Clinton administration officials are still holding out the hope that they may bring Mr. Putin around by the end of the year. And some observers have speculated the solution might be a grand bargain in which the United States would move forward on missile defense in return for arms cuts that Russia is seeking.</p>
        <p>There are, however, several reasons why the Clinton administration is unlikely to succeed. For one thing, the Clinton administration does not appear to have pursued the grand bargain with any real enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>Driven by budgetary pressures, for example, Moscow has urged that the two sides agree to slash their strategic arms to 1,500 warheads as part of a Start III treaty. That would be substantially less than the level of 2,000 to 2,500 warheads the United States has insisted on.</p>
        <p>In his news conference today, Mr. Clinton did not rule out the deeper cuts. But administration officials said later that such cuts probably could not be considered until after a Start III treaty was concluded.</p>
        <p>One reason is that the Pentagon is opposed to such deep cuts, and the White House does not want to pick a fight with the military during an election year. Also, the Clinton administration has not yet conducted the sort of wide-ranging review of its nuclear war plans and targeting policy that would be required to properly assess such a significant reduction.</p>
        <p>''We have previously agreed to a range of 2,000 to 2,500 on Start III,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''If we were to come down below it, it would require us to change our strategic plan, and we believe it would be much better, if we were going to do that, if we could also know that we were defending ourselves against a new threat.''</p>
        <p>Another reason why a breakthrough does not seem near is that Russian officials know missile defense is a campaign issue. Even if they agree to Mr. Clinton's proposal, they may end up negotiating again with George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican candidate, who is promoting a far grander plan.</p>
        <p>The more fundamental reason, however, is that Mr. Putin and his generals are still deeply concerned that a missile defense will unleash a competition in defensive technology that the financially pressed Russian state is bound to lose. Even if the United States builds a limited defense, the Russians say, it is likely to be just the first phase in a more ambitious system that would give it a strategic edge.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the summit meeting was to ease those anxieties. While administration officials sought to put the best face on the meeting, they acknowledged that there was still considerable work to do.</p>
        <p>Russia, Mr. Talbott added, still believes that an American missile defense ''will undermine strategic stability, threaten Russia's strategic deterrent and provoke an arms race.''</p>
