        <p>I have never thought writing novels was hard work. Hard work was commercial fishing out of New Bedford or Gloucester or driving a 16-wheel truck.

        <p>I have never thought writing novels was hard work. Hard work was commercial fishing out of New Bedford or Gloucester or driving a 16-wheel truck. Novels have more to do with desire -- translating desire into prose -- and a temperament that accepts concentration over the long haul, meaning the ability to sit alone in one place day by day.</p>
        <p>Writing novels bears some modest (very modest) comparison to grinding on the higher slopes of the P.G.A. tour, magical afternoons bunkered by afternoons of routine or appalling play and reminding yourself every minute to trust your swing.</p>
        <p>Middle-aged golfers watching the Houston Open on television last month turned their faces to the wall when the 46-year-old Craig Stadler, playing beautifully from tee to green, missed short putts on four consecutive playoff holes to lose the match to Robert Allenby, not yet 30. Allenby was not playing well, except on the green, where it counted.</p>
        <p>My heart went out to Stadler, gray-haired, red-faced, so weary and impatient, so eager to get it over with. During the four-day run of the tournament he had used up his ration of concentration. He needed a distraction, something droll or alarming, anything that would divide him from the task at hand and cause him to reflect. His five-foot putts had become a kind of tyranny. (And the five-foot putt is the golfer's equivalent of the true sentence that completes the chapter.)</p>
        <p>I hoped for a monstrous rainstorm so Stadler could go away, get a good night's sleep and return the following morning. Meanwhile Allenby was as steady as a metronome, completing his chapters with the authority and -- it has to be said -- the slow motion of Henry James in his late period.</p>
        <p>For many years I have tried to find an agreeable distraction, something more sideline than hobby, some avocation that was not too difficult or tyrannical or long-term. When the sentences began to fall apart, there would be this other thing to do, my equivalent of a good night's sleep: except the sleep might last for weeks. Of course there would be money in it, whatever it was.</p>
        <p>I was willing to try almost anything. The truth is, I thought of this activity as a day at the racetrack. If you forgot about hunches, if you studied the form and bet every race, the odds were good that you would cash at least one ticket. Perhaps, if you were clever enough, a win ticket or even the daily double.</p>
        <p>My children described this as dad's search for a get-rich-quick scheme. But I only wanted to get out of the office.</p>
        <p>For a long time I thought I could do voice-overs, the sort of thing that David McCullough does so well for ''The American Experience.'' I have what I have always believed was a nicely modulated baritone, perhaps riddled a little around the edges by tobacco and Scotch, but inviting nonetheless. That voice, I imagined people saying, that voice has been around. I asked a friend where I might take this undiscovered talent, and after listening to a tape, she said commercials. An arthritis remedy or something to do with heartburn or anxiety. Mr. McCullough is safe, she added.</p>
        <p>And that brings me to Paris, February 1991. A long, gray winter, the dollar falling. My wife and I had moved from one overpriced apartment to another. I had completed the novel I was working on and was unwilling to begin another right away.</p>
        <p>The worm of avocation had begun to crawl yet again, to no positive result. I spent my time watching the Persian Gulf war on television and visiting museums, never neglecting a nourishing meal at the end of the day. It was at one of these that two German friends, a diplomat and a historian, suggested we go together to see Patrick Suskind's play ''La Contrebasse,'' at the Theatre des Arts-Hebertot. The author was a friend of theirs.</p>
        <p>I very much admired his novel ''Perfume,'' and  under normal circumstances I would have agreed at once. It's always interesting when writers change hats: poets to novelists, novelists to playwrights. But circumstances were not normal. ''La Contrebasse'' was in French, and I did not speak French. My wife spoke French. She dealt with the plumbers, electricians, doctors, dentists and Le Monde. I was the one who sat in cafes and listened to conversations, inventing my own translations.</p>
        <p>Don't worry, the diplomat said. We'll translate for you.</p>
        <p>The historian seconded the motion.</p>
        <p>My wife insisted that I knew more French than I thought I did, and, en tout cas, everyone would chip in with key words and phrases.</p>
        <p>What a pleasure for those sitting around us, I thought but did not say.</p>
        <p>So we attended ''La Contrebasse'' by Patrick Suskind at the Theatre des Arts-Hebertot. It turned out to be a one-character play involving a musician and his double bass. I had matters pretty well in hand until about the fifth minute, when the narrative collapsed. I had no idea what the actor, Jacques Villeret, was saying.</p>
        <p>I inferred that he and his double bass had an extremely complicated relationship, and that things were not going well between them. The action transpired in the musician's apartment somewhere in bohemian Paris, the Marais, perhaps, or Montparnasse.</p>
        <p>The audience was laughing; my wife and our German friends were enthralled. So any idea of assistance with the salient words and phrases was forgotten. For me these were minutes of oceanic boredom until my mind suddenly slipped into another realm altogether. As I did in cafes, I began to supply my own translation. Just as suddenly, the musician and his double bass vanished. In their places appeared a newspaper reporter and his typewriter.</p>
        <p>The newspaper reporter was middle-aged, as was the musician; and the typewriter was well worn and talismanic, as was the double bass. The reporter seemed to have an affectionate relationship with the machine; it was his career that was going to hell.</p>
        <p>The set remained the same: a couch, a desk, two tables, chairs here and there, a bookcase. But Paris had become Cincinnati because in my mind's eye I saw the poster that hung on my office wall in the Rue des Saints-Peres: Edward Hopper's ''Street Scene, Gloucester,'' Cincinnati Art Museum.</p>
        <p>My newspaperman was 55. He was a soloist, a little scornful of the ensemble. Along the way he managed to win a Pulitzer Prize, a badge he thought was not entirely deserved. When the curtain rose, Act I, Scene 1, he erupted on the stage in a fury, as Jacques Villeret had done.</p>
        <p>I have no idea of the cause of the musician's agitation, but the newspaperman was returning from the funeral of a colleague, with the justified suspicion that his editor wanted to fire him. If my newsman had thought of himself as a musician, he would have chosen Bach, for the measured cadence and formality of expression. But since he thought of himself as an artist, he believed that on his best days he captured something of Hopper. His editor preferred Roy Lichtenstein, so my man was headed for the shelf.</p>
        <p>How did it go? My wife asked when ''La Contrebasse'' was over.</p>
        <p>Wonderful, I said.</p>
        <p>She looked at me with astonishment.</p>
        <p>You understood it?</p>
        <p>Everything, I said. Nothing.</p>
        <p>''Lowell Limpett'' took four days to write. Really, all I had to do was transcribe what I had written in my head during the 90-minute reverie in the Theatre des Arts-Hebertot. I had been given a free bet at the track, so the writing was a lark, as if I had decided to compose a long letter to a friend or a bedtime story for my grandchildren.</p>
        <p>I put into it all I had ever known or heard about newspaper reporters reaching the end of their one-way street, all seen through the lens of my own newspaper experience of decades before; alternative histories, as someone called it. My character was more restrained than Patrick Suskind's, at least as Jacques Villeret played him. But his double bass and my typewriter were brothers, and I can remember now the unfathomable rapid-fire French mutating into measured American idiom, and my surprise when the curtain fell and the audience broke into applause.</p>
        <p>I wrote the play, had a good laugh and thought that I had found my sideline, except that I had no expectation that anyone would want to risk a production. So it was a pro bono sideline, with some vanity thrown in.</p>
        <p>''Lowell Limpett'' had its debut in Paris in March 1991: a living room full of invited guests; many, many drinks before the curtain rose; Alan Riding, a reporter for The New York Times, in the title role. Somewhere a videotape survives, but owing to inattention or too much Bordeaux or mechanical failure, the tape is without sound. Since virtually everyone in attendance was connected to the news business, there was high hilarity. Everyone thought it had commercial possibilities. What a vehicle! And so funny!</p>
        <p>That summer I sent it around, first to friends in the theater business, then to friends of the friends, finally to theater companies. But you know this story. This is an old story without possibilities, because all unhappy theater stories are alike. Each happy theater story is happy in its own way. I put ''Lowell Limpett'' into the discard file and forgot about it, reminded only when I glanced at Hopper's picture on my office wall.</p>
        <p>And there matters stood for eight years. We returned to New England. I published four novels, did a voice-over, continued my struggles with golf, searching always for an agreeable sideline.</p>
        <p>A few months ago I got a call from the playwright Michael Weller. He had seen the manuscript of ''Lowell Limpett'' in 1991 and liked it, and he now proposed that I sign up with the mentor program for emerging playwrights at the Cherry Lane Alternative Theater in Manhattan. You get a mentor to smooth the rough edges and the promise of a 10-day run at the Cherry Lane Alternative.</p>
        <p>If I had any doubts -- and what doubts were there to have? -- they were forgotten when I learned the identity of my mentor. Wendy Wasserstein owns a Pulitzer Prize, just like Lowell Limpett. Unlike Lowell Limpett, she's young enough to be my daughter.</p>
        <p>Mentee, she said, and began to cackle.</p>
        <p>What can I expect? I asked.</p>
        <p>This is a get-rich-quick scheme, she said, and laughed and laughed.</p>
