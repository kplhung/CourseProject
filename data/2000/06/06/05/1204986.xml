        <p>In the expanding world of meta-media (translation: journalists writing about journalists) the Web site NewsWatch.org has been a relatively tiny boutique.</p>
        <p>Its offerings were limited, tailored to those interested in what was written, not who was doing the writing. Last week, it became the first casualty among the current generation of meta-media sites, as its one financial backer backed off.</p>
        <p>As Paul Mongerson, a former engineer and executive who originally offered $1 million to underwrite the site, explained on Friday, his original idea was to point out examples of distortion by the media.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't to educate people or philosophize,'' he said. ''It was to say, 'This is what is said, and it's not the case.' The purpose was to bring ordinary news consumers into the debate over media distortion that currently takes place among elites.''</p>
        <p>But in the end, he said, the audience of about 25,000 unique visitors each month turned out to be not the news consumers that Mr. Mongerson had put up $1 million to reach, but the same old elites.</p>
        <p>You know, the ones who hop from Jim Romenesko's MediaNews site (www.poynter.org/ medianews/index.cfm) to Kurt Andersen's Inside.com to the Online Journalism Review (ojr.usc.edu) -- all sites that were quick to note the death in the neighborhood last week.</p>
        <p>Trevor Butterworth, the editor of the two-year-old site, said the decision came as a shock when he heard about it last week.</p>
        <p>''We thought our success in creating an audience and winning plaudits on a minor scale,'' he said, was something Mr. Mongerson would appreciate.</p>
        <p>''But he had a different vision,'' Mr. Butterworth added, ''and what we managed to do did not please him so he pulled the plug.''</p>
        <p>S. Robert Lichter, president of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, the organization that runs NewsWatch, said on Friday that he had some hope of finding new financing. But when he spoke of the site, it was in the past tense.</p>
        <p>''We showed what you can do as a mom-and-pop organization,'' he said, ''but we also showed the limits of that.''</p>
