        <p>Telewest Communications P.L.C., Britain's second-largest cable television company, is expected to announce as early as this week that it will acquire a stake of about 10 percent in Chello Broadband N.V., executives close to the talks said tonight.</p>
        <p>Chello, which provides high-speed access to the Internet across Europe, is a unit of United Pan-Europe Communications N.V., the European cable television company.</p>
        <p>It remains unclear how much Telewest would pay for the Chello stake. Executives close to the talks also said United Pan-Europe could take a big stake in Telewest as part of the deal.</p>
        <p>If the acquisition of the Chello stake proceeds, Telewest, whose biggest shareholders include Microsoft and the Liberty Media Group, a unit of AT&amp;T, would be taking a stake in the European equivalent of the At Home Corporation, the high-speed Internet service provider in which AT&amp;T holds a controlling stake. It would also give Chello access to Telewest's cable customers in Britain. Chello's high-speed Internet service is available in nine countries served by the United Pan-Europe Communications cable network.</p>
        <p>Chello, which had been planning to offer shares to the public on May 31 on the Nasdaq and Amsterdam stock exchanges, postponed its offering. Executives close to the companies said they were working to reach a deal by the end of this week so they could proceed with the initial offering. They cautioned, however, that as with any deal, they could both still decide to abandon the effort.</p>
        <p>Executives close to the talks said it had been difficult to put a value on Chello because of the recent gyrations among technology stocks. Before Chello's initial offering was first pulled, it had planned to sell 27 million shares -- 10 percent of the company -- for 13 to 17 euros, or $12.30 to $16.08, each.</p>
