        <p>CNN celebrated its 20th anniversary in Atlanta on Thursday night with fireworks and video clips of the news organization's proudest moments: the Persian Gulf war, the space shuttle Challenger disaster, the Olympic Park bombing in 1996.</p>
        <p>But another scene perhaps better reflected the current mood at the CNN Center: reporters chasing the network's founder, Ted Turner, through hallways, up escalators and even into a public bathroom as he tried to avoid their questions.</p>
        <p>That Mr. Turner was avoiding journalists on one of his proudest days, the celebration of a milestone for his news network, underscored the many uncertainties facing CNN as it reaches young adulthood.</p>
        <p>For all of its accomplishments, CNN is currently garnering its lowest monthly ratings in nine years, a fact that has prompted its top executives to reevaluate the way the network approaches news.</p>
        <p>At the same time, CNN is expected to come under the ownership of a new company this fall, when its parent corporation, Time Warner, is scheduled to merge officially with America Online. Anticipation of that merger is creating both anxiety and hope among CNN executives.</p>
        <p>On the one hand, it is believed that AOL, the largest Internet service provider, with 22 million subscribers, can help bring CNN back to a dominant position among news organizations. On the other, the new company will have a new management structure and, possibly, new ideas about how to do things, especially when ratings are low.</p>
        <p>And, despite all declarations of harmony at the anniversary celebration, one fact is inescapable: Under the new company's flow chart, Mr. Turner, CNN's most ardent protector and champion, will still hold the title of vice chairman and senior adviser -- but he will no longer have direct, operating control of the cable properties he amassed over three decades. That role would go to AOL's president, Robert W. Pittman. Just days before the festivities in Atlanta began, The Los Angeles Times reported that Mr. Turner, Time Warner's largest individual stock holder -- who will own 4 percent of AOL-Time Warner -- was displeased about his new role and associates were warning that he could disrupt the merger. That threat was emerging just as the companies were sending voting materials to their shareholders.</p>
        <p>Executives within the two companies confirmed last week that Mr. Turner was angry, but not necessarily so much about his new role. Rather, they said, he felt he was not properly consulted as the flow chart was drafted and was caught off guard upon its release a month ago.</p>
        <p>With all of this in mind, Stephen M. Case, the AOL chairman, and Gerald M. Levin, the Time Warner chairman, went out of their way to declare publicly last week that he would play a large role in the new company and in CNN.</p>
        <p>By Thursday, Mr. Turner had apparently changed his tune.</p>
        <p>''Happy -- I'm happy!,'' he told a reporter. He added, ''You can be unhappy one week and happy another one, right?'' Then three public relations executives approached and the conversation ceased.</p>
        <p>Still, given these apparent corporate mood swings, it should come as no surprise that top executives at CNN are an uneasy lot these days.</p>
        <p>''Whenever there is change, there is uncertainty and anxiety,'' said Tom Johnson, the CNN chairman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson said his most fundamental concern was whether AOL would try to meddle with the network's journalism. He said CNN executives had similar concerns in 1996, when Time Warner merged with Turner Broadcasting. Time Warner, however, took the same hands-off approach that Mr. Turner did.</p>
        <p>''It was a very, very smooth transition because journalism is at the core of Time Warner,'' Mr. Johnson said, referring to its publications like Time. ''And up until this most recent announcement, we have really felt quite confident about the future.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson said he and others have received reassurances on two key issues from Mr. Case, AOL's chairman, and Mr. Pittman, AOL's president, that AOL will not pressure CNN to pursue racier, tabloid stories and production values that might do better in the ratings than the standard international and political news, and that it will allow CNN to cover the news impartially regardless of its affiliation with AOL. On the bright side, CNN is hoping for the exposure that AOL can give it.</p>
        <p>But, in the wake of the recent ratings declines, Mr. Johnson said there had even been discussions inside CNN about changing editorial direction.</p>
        <p>CNN has been consistently dogged by one major problem that is almost inherent to its mission: viewers will go to it in droves when major news breaks, but tend to go elsewhere when the news cycle is slow. With an average of 225,000 households tuning in each day in May, CNN's ratings are down 33 percent, compared with those of May 1999, and are at their lowest monthly level since 1991.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the network is facing new competition from cable competitors like the Fox News Channel, which is growing considerably, and NBC's offerings, MSNBC and CNBC.</p>
        <p>The ratings situation is said to be, at times, of pressing concern to Mr. Turner. Mr. Johnson said that Mr. Turner was extremely concerned in midwinter, when CNBC's early evening business show, ''Business Center,'' for the first time beat CNN's ''Moneyline'' in the monthly ratings. Mr. Turner then began conversations with Lou Dobbs, the former ''Moneyline'' anchor and CNNfn president who is respected by Wall Street but left last year in a public scene when Time Warner executives tried to limit his ownership of space.com, the space Web site.</p>
        <p>''Ted was disappointed,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''Ted wanted to bring Lou back and he initiated conversations with Lou, first by phone and then in person.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dobbs left CNN last June amid boiling tensions with the CNN United States president, Rick Kaplan, that made any collaboration between the two top executives difficult, if not impossible, and it was believed within the organization that his return would bring them to the surface once again. Mr. Johnson said that he vehemently opposed the move, but that he did so on the grounds that Mr. Dobbs would still own part of space.com, hindering his impartiality as a journalist. The idea was dropped.</p>
        <p>Of that move, Mr. Turner would only say in an interview, ''That was a long time ago.'' And, he said of the current ratings situation: ''I'm not the kind to panic. It's not so precarious as when we started,'' a reference to the earliest days at CNN when on-air personalities had to contend with dropping ceiling panels, low-rent equipment and absolutely negligible ratings.</p>
        <p>Despite the reassurances he has received from AOL, Mr. Johnson said concern was high enough that debate continued even inside CNN about whether to produce sexier programming. But, Mr. Johnson said, he and other executives concluded that the organization should resist such temptation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Case said he agreed, and that he was not concerned by the current ratings. ''I think some of these things are cyclical,'' he said. He and Mr. Levin said that Mr. Johnson and Mr. Kaplan would continue to have their full support in their positions.</p>
        <p>In fact, CNN executives said that the strategy was to bolster the news network's international coverage with more foreign bureaus.</p>
        <p>But, most important, they said, they hope to strengthen CNN's overall presence by promoting it well on the AOL Internet and interactive TV services and by making it more available on wireless devices. Specific plans, they said, are in embryonic stages, but, ultimately it is their intention to make CNN's headlines available anywhere at any time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaplan said he believes that sort of ubiquity in distribution would make the current concerns about ratings seem quaint. In anticipation, Turner advertising sales executives have held discussions with Nielsen Media Research, the television ratings service, about broadening the way it will measure CNN's audience to account for viewers who may get its headlines on their cellular phones and computers.</p>
        <p>''We're going to have to have a broader view at AOL-Time Warner about what advertising really means,'' Mr. Levin said, adding that CNN's advertising revenues are up considerably despite ratings declines.</p>
        <p>That sort of broad advertising sales approach is a main reason why, executives said, Mr. Turner's operational duties are being taken over by Mr. Pittman, the AOL executive who is to oversee all pay services of AOL-Time Warner. The task will demand close attention to the merging of old and new media, two areas where Mr. Pittman, a founder of Viacom's MTV, has considerable experience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin said that Mr. Turner would exert as much influence as ever. ''It doesn't make any difference what our prosaic reporting lines are,'' he said. ''What really matters is that he is there and that he is a transcendent figure.''</p>
        <p>Of course, with the merger pending, and Mr. Turner's displeasure now out in the open, it is in the interest of top AOL and Time Warner executives to avoid controversy and keep Mr. Turner's spirits up.</p>
        <p>That could explain why, in the minutes leading up to their big celebration on Thursday night in Mr. Turner's Philips Arena, which was to feature Diana Ross and the Supremes, CNN assigned a publicity executive to each reporter covering the event for other organizations.</p>
        <p>But, it turned out that they really did not have much to fear.</p>
        <p>As a reporter approached him at one point, Mr. Turner grabbed Mr. Case by the neck and pulled him close. ''See: I'm happy!'' he said.</p>
