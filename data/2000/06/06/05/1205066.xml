        <p>Grace &amp; Rothschild in New York, founded in 1986 by two former executives of the old Doyle Dane Bernbach agency, is closing after the loss of its largest account, the Land Rover unit of Ford Motor.</p>
        <p>The remaining accounts and 11 employees, as well as Diane Rothschild, the president, are being absorbed by Della Femina/Jeary &amp; Partners in New York.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rothschild, 51, becomes a partner and executive creative director at Della Femina/Jeary, which is being renamed Della Femina Rothschild Jeary &amp; Partners.</p>
        <p>The Omnicom Group will continue to own 49 percent of the agency, with the rest owned by top managers. Jerry Della Femina will remain partner, chairman and executive creative director and Michael Jeary will remain partner and chief operating officer.</p>
        <p>Roy Grace, who had been chairman at Grace &amp; Rothschild, is not joining Della Femina Rothschild Jeary. He is ''taking a break'' from advertising, Ms. Rothschild said.</p>
        <p>The accounts being shifted to Della Femina Rothschild Jeary are William Grant &amp; Sons and Marsh &amp; McLennan, with combined billings estimated at $30 million.</p>
        <p>The Land Rover account, which Grace &amp; Rothschild lost to GSD&amp;M in Austin, Tex., a unit of Omnicom, had billings estimated at $30 million to $40 million.</p>
