        <p>Hoping to soothe ruffled readers, the online magazine Salon.com completed its product recall last week.</p>
        <p>Salon pulled back the site redesign, which had elicited an immediate and hearty chorus of e-mail boos and hisses from readers after it was introduced on May 22. The disgruntled audience said the new site included bugs, was hard to navigate and used type that was too small to read.</p>
        <p>Within two days, Salon's editor, David Talbot, posted a note to readers saying he had heard their wails and was taking the concerns into consideration. Then, last Thursday, came another note from Talbot, entitled ''Salon to readers: you win!'' and introducing a new new design that addressed many of the readers' criticisms.</p>
        <p>The new five-column look remains in place, but the third and fourth columns effectively serve as a single column to showcase a feature article. Type sizes can be controlled by readers, and headlines for the main articles once again link directly to the reports, rather than taking readers through department home pages.</p>
        <p>Mr. Talbot said the magazine in its latest guise had accomplished the goals of promoting breaking news from news services while also featuring more of Salon's own content. But he said the latest overhaul had also removed the bugs and eliminated some of the ''horizontal sprawl'' that one reader complained about in the May 22 redesign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Talbot said the ''ear splitting'' response had indicated how deeply the readership was attached to the magazine. ''We unwittingly turned our readers into a focus group,'' he said, noting a lesson for any future redesigns. ''Maybe we'll test it out a little internally first.''</p>
