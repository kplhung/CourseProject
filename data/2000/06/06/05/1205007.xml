        <p>Israel's secret service has tightened security around Prime Minister Ehud Barak, news media reports say, as some Jewish settlers here warn that the domestic climate has the potential to turn ugly and violent quickly if the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks move forward.</p>
        <p>The alarm bells began ringing here last week, when the leader of a young, radical settlers' group issued an unsettling assessment of the feelings in his community -- feelings raised by the real prospect that some settlers would be evacuated as a result of a peace deal.</p>
        <p>''Today, when I see Barak's plans and I hear the voices around me,'' said Shimon Riklin, leader of the Next Generation settlers' organization, ''I say that if, God forbid, he carries out this dangerous plan, his days could be numbered.''</p>
        <p>To Israelis, who are only now coming to grips with the traumatic assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, this kind of language is profoundly disturbing. The country is in a far different place now, having absorbed the initial shocks of what concessions the peace effort entails.</p>
        <p>But among the political leadership and the security establishment, the fear of being caught unawares or unprepared -- much less of reliving such a trauma as the assassination -- is strong. So as the threats continued over the weekend with more inflammatory statements by an extremist settler and two rabbis, Mr. Barak's close associates seemed eager to take them at their word.</p>
        <p>''Dear friends, there will be a murder,'' Communications Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer said today on the Israeli radio. ''I am warning the security services and everyone: Don't put your heads in the sand.''</p>
        <p>The director general of the Settlers Council, an umbrella organization with a relatively moderate leadership, said today that he did not believe Mr. Barak faced any danger from his movement. The council repeatedly condemned the use of violence today, although it declined to condemn any of the statements that others considered inflammatory.</p>
        <p>And the Settlers Council's spokesman, Yeshoshua Mor Yosef, even said in an interview that he thought that the prime minister's bureau was fabricating information about supposed threats on Mr. Barak's life in order to manipulate public opinion.</p>
        <p>At the same time, an evening newscast cited unidentified security sources as saying it would be impossible to tighten security around the prime minister since it was already supposed to be air-tight. Mr. Barak's office would not comment.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Barak addressed the issue of incitement during his closed-door cabinet meeting, his bureau made some of his remarks public. As he habitually does, he expressed deep respect for ''the settlement enterprise,'' which has sought over several decades to reclaim the West Bank from the Palestinians, seeing it as the biblical Land of Israel.</p>
        <p>But he also delivered a warning of his own against any attempt to use violence, or the threat of violence, to derail his peacemaking plans -- which he sees as a continuation of the work of his mentor, Mr. Rabin. It is futile, he said, to try to block a ''historical process.''</p>
        <p>''The murder of Yitzhak Rabin was a human and national tragedy, but it could not stop the peace process,'' Mr. Barak told his cabinet, a statement released by his office said. ''This is a flawed grasp of reality.</p>
        <p>''The repercussions of any political assassination would boomerang against those fighting for the Greater Land of Israel,'' he said. ''If there is anything that deviates from the legitimacy of the settlers' struggle, it is acts such as these.''</p>
        <p>Yigal Amir, an ultra-nationalist Jew who was convicted of murdering Mr. Rabin, has said he acted to thwart plans to transfer land to the Palestinians. The assassination took place against the backdrop of increasingly vicious personal attacks on Mr. Rabin, and many here believe that an atmosphere of incitement, including some by rabbis, encouraged Mr. Amir and other extremists.</p>
        <p>As the settlers' movement gears up to battle Mr. Barak, some here worry that protest rallies could once again get out of hand as verbal hostility increases. A settler rabbi, for instance, published an article this weekend accusing the government of ''treason'' and ''crimes against the Jewish people.''</p>
        <p>As if transported back in time, many Israelis rushed to say what some wished they had said five years ago. Among them was Carmi Gilon, who was director of the General Security Services at the time of the assassination and resigned afterward. In an interview on the Israeli radio, he said, ''It behooves the rabbis to understand the weight of responsibility they bear and to be cautious in their statements.''</p>
        <p>In a similar vein, David Levy, the foreign minister, said: ''Rabbis, I call to you, be careful with your words. You are spiritual leaders, and dangerous expressions could, God forbid, bring about another blow that we won't be able to withstand.''</p>
        <p>The secret service has also stepped up its monitoring of extreme right-wing groups, officials said.</p>
        <p>To many Palestinian officials, the idea of such anxiety seems a bit premature. Although President Clinton sounded a note of optimism last week when he said a peace accord was ''within view,'' Palestinian and Israeli officials have been exchanging barbs about what they call each other's recalcitrance, and both sides say the talks on substantive issues are at an early stage.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Barak continued to break character and to criticize the Palestinians publicly, as he did last week for the first time. He described their conduct in the talks as ''a regression.'' With a September deadline for a final accord looming, he said the Palestinians were postponing discussions ''on various pretexts'' and generally dragging their feet. The Palestinians issued the same charge in the opposite direction.</p>
        <p>The Palestinians are pushing for the next land transfer, which is supposed to take place this month. Associates of Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, say he is determined to obtain as much land as possible from the Israelis in case the negotiations break down; that land will be the sole basis for a Palestinian state if he unilaterally declares one in September, as he has warned that he will do if talks do not progress.</p>
        <p>But in Israel, as opposed to the Palestinian side, where there is far deeper skepticism, the general presumption is that the peace talks are marching forward. Thus the settlers' anxiety is increasing.</p>
        <p>In a speech on Friday to his Labor Party, Mr. Barak said he aspired to keep 80 percent of the settlers under Israeli sovereignty in the final accord. He said that such a level would be an ''unusual historic achievement'' and that the settler movement would have achieved its goal of permanence.</p>
        <p>''Barak urges us to see the cup as half full,'' Shimon Shiffer said today in the newspaper Yediot Ahronot.</p>
        <p>But the settlers were not buying it.</p>
