        <p>''We have agreed to a statement of principles,'' President Clinton told a joint news conference in Moscow, ''which I urge you to read carefully.''</p>
        <p>Noting that the Russian and American sides disagreed on whether a limited missile defense against rogue states posed a threat to the mutual deterrence of the ABM treaty, Clinton added: ''The statement of principles that we have agreed to I thought reflected an attempt to bring our positions closer together . . . let me say I urge you all to read that.''</p>
        <p>O.K., let's read it. The central issue is whether the U.S. will allow Russia to hold us to the ABM treaty negotiated 30 years ago with the Soviet Union. We want to build defenses against the few missiles from terrorist nations, not the thousands held by Russia. President Vladimir Putin of Russia wants to make us pay for his permission by slashing our offensive missile forces in Start III down to levels our military leaders consider imprudent.</p>
        <p>Clinton went along with the sweeping assertion that the two nations ''reaffirm their commitment to that [ABM] treaty as a cornerstone of strategic stability.''</p>
        <p>Putin then gave Clinton a little wiggle room by agreeing that the missile threat from other nations ''represents a potentially significant change in the strategic situation . . .'' and to ''consider possible proposals for further increasing the viability of the Treaty.'' That means allowing the U.S. to defend its cities against rogue nations, terrorists and accidental launches only in ways that Moscow approves.</p>
        <p>Thrice did Clinton embrace the word viability, which means ''capable of living.'' He committed the U.S. ''to strengthen the ABM treaty and to enhance its viability'' and agreed that we ''attach great importance  to enhancing the viability of the Treaty. . . .''</p>
        <p>So here we have Clinton breathing new life into the cold-war treaty provided Putin will allow some minor amendments that may not meet future U.S. defense needs.</p>
        <p>And then the outgoing American president stepped into the incoming Russian president's trap. He paid for Putin's permission to tinker with the ABM treaty with an enormous concession:</p>
        <p>''They agree that issues of strategic offensive arms cannot be considered in isolation from issues of strategic defensive arms and vice versa. . . .''</p>
        <p>Read that again to savor its import: that is the principle of linkage. It's what Putin's military wanted and what Clinton never should have given.</p>
        <p>''Issues of strategic offensive arms'' means Start III: the reduction of the massive U.S. and Russian arsenals. The issue there is how far to cut: our military says our strength would be sapped at fewer than 2,000 missiles, while the Russians -- who can't afford to keep that many nukes -- want us to weaken our worldwide missile forces by 25 percent more.</p>
        <p>''Issues of strategic defensive arms'' means ABM and our national missile defense against dictators who could threaten us with nuclear blackmail and against a possible Chinese threat. By mistakenly linking reductions in Start III (our missile offense) to the minor modification of ABM (our missile defense), Clinton played into Russian hands, making future arms negotiation more difficult for his American successor.</p>
        <p>Now here comes the strange part. Putin must know the substantial difference in approach between candidates Al Gore and George W. Bush. Gore goes along with Clinton and presumably will embrace his ABM-Start III linkage. Bush wants a free hand with a limited anti-missile system and would set our offensive missiles at a level to suit our deterrent needs, inviting the Russians to reciprocate. Huge policy difference.</p>
        <p>And yet Putin said, ''We're familiar with the programs of the two candidates . . . we're willing to go forward on either one of these approaches.''</p>
        <p>Did he mean to ad-lib that? Was he misinterpreted? Having won his linkage with Clinton-Gore, is the inexperienced Putin willing to toss that advantage aside with Bush? Is a puzzlement.</p>
        <p>Despite Clinton's policy error, he neither embraced the K.G.B.'s man nor called him ''Volodya.'' Our president's demeanor remained coolly correct, and we can at least be thankful for that.</p>
