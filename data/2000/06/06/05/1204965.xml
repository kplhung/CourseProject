        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Mary Gordon's look back at her mother's economy of necessity (Op-Ed, May 29) expressed my own awe at the way money is spent today.</p>
        <p>I remember how my mom collected the wrappers packed around fruit to use for toilet tissue: how every piece of paper had a second function. As the fifth girl in the family, I didn't wear a brand-new garment until I went to work. Eating out meant going to an aunt's house for dinner.</p>

        <p>Mary Gordon's look back at her mother's economy of necessity (Op-Ed, May 29) expressed my own awe at the way money is spent today.</p>
        <p>I remember how my mom collected the wrappers packed around fruit to use for toilet tissue: how every piece of paper had a second function. As the fifth girl in the family, I didn't wear a brand-new garment until I went to work. Eating out meant going to an aunt's house for dinner.</p>
        <p>Although my children got more than I did, luxuries were few. When they bought homes for more than $100,000, I trembled with fear that they would lose them, trapped as I was in the Depression mentality.</p>
        <p>People talk about the good old days. They were not all that good. Now I give gifts that cost more than I once spent on a year's worth of clothes. My mother would have looked on the salaries and pensions that constitute my earnings in wonderment. I still do, but with gratitude.</p>
