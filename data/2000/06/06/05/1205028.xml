        <p>Vicky Bullett, the Washington Mystics' power forward, was not about to be fooled twice. Bullett felt she and her teammates failed to take advantage of the inside scoring chances the Cleveland Rockers gave them on Saturday. The way Bullett figured it, the Mystics should have pounded the ball down low. They didn't, and they were routed.</p>
        <p>Before today's game against the Liberty, Bullett vowed the Mystics would not let it happen again. ''We have to play well down low, and take advantage of the opportunities when we get them,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The Mystics made the most of the opportunities that came their way today: they turned 16 Liberty turnovers into 22 points, made 23 of 31 free-throw attempts and, aided by the home-court backing of 15,329 vociferous fans, defeated the Liberty, 79-67.</p>
        <p>And they did some damage down low.</p>
        <p>''They were much more physical than us down inside,'' Coach Richie Adubato of the Liberty said. ''We allowed them to get the ball in the low post. We really didn't shoot it well near the end.''</p>
        <p>The Liberty players, coming off their first victory of the season, over the Utah Starzz on Saturday, arrived at the MCI Center less than four hours before the 1 p.m. tip-off. They locked themselves in their locker room to study game tape and an offense redesigned to accommodate changes in the lineup caused by injuries to forward Crystal Robinson and center Olga Firsova.</p>
        <p>Their game plan, which worked on Saturday, faltered today. The Mystics (2-1) had five players score in double figures, including Murriel Page with 15 points and Bullett with 11. Washington led by 42-29 at halftime behind Nikki McCray's 11 first-half points. She finished with 13.</p>
        <p>The closest the Liberty (1-3) came in the second half was 76-67 with 28.1 seconds left. Vicky Johnson led the Liberty with 12 points.</p>
        <p>Chamique Holdsclaw, the native New Yorker who appears to be enjoying the intensifying rivalry between Washington and New York, led all scorers with 22 points. Holdsclaw, still hampered by the left foot she injured last fall while playing with the United States national team, shrugged off questions about the injury, saying pro players had to learn ''to play through the pain.''</p>
        <p>''This was a real big game because we knew New York was going to come out strong and play well because they want to pay us back for last year,'' Holdsclaw said.</p>
        <p>Last season the Mystics defeated the Liberty in three of four meetings, including by 83-61 at Madison Square Garden. The Liberty salvaged its only victory in the final matchup between the teams. The two teams are very likely to contend for the Eastern Conference title, which New York won last season, and have developed a growing rivalry.</p>
        <p>After today's game, some Liberty players were smarting because, they said, they had overheard Mystics Coach Nancy Darsch tell her players: ''Kill them.''</p>
        <p>''I would never say anything like that,'' said Darsch, who coached the Liberty in their first two seasons.  ''That's not me.''</p>
        <p>Darsch said she chose to reinsert her starters with less than 1 minute 30 seconds left in the game and with a 12-point lead ''because New York can score a bunch in a short time.''</p>
        <p>''Last year they took us to overtime on this court when we thought we had a comfortable lead,'' she said. ''This time I didn't hesitate to make some changes.''</p>
        <p>As for the Liberty: things won't get any easier any time soon. New York's next two games are on the road against Detroit on Wednesday and Indiana on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Adubato said he would give the team a day off to regroup. Adubato also wants to give forward Tari Phillips, starting for Robinson, and Marina Ferragut, the 6-foot-3-inch Spanish forward who plays professionally in Brazil, and did not arrive in New York until last week, more time to learn the team's offense.</p>
        <p>''It seems like we play two times a day, so it hurts our preparation,'' Adubato said. ''We need practice time. We make mistakes whenever we try to make adjustments or changes. Because Marina and Tari aren't acclimated to our system, they really don't know what we're doing, so it's very difficult.''</p>
