        <p>In a first for a director, Michael Blakemore won a doubleheader last night, capturing Tony Awards as the best director of both a play and a musical at the 54th annual ceremony honoring the best of Broadway.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blakemore won for the revival of Cole Porter's musical ''Kiss Me, Kate'' and for Michael Frayn's play ''Copenhagen.''</p>
        <p>Ten years ago the British director was also nominated twice, although he won neither for the musical ''City of Angels'' nor for the play ''Lettice and Lovage'' that year.</p>
        <p>''All I can say is, 'Thank you, America,' '' Mr. Blakemore said last night in one of his acceptance speeches during the awards at Radio City Music Hall. ''And of course by America I mean New York, and by New York I mean Broadway.''</p>
        <p>Adding to the triumph of Mr. Blakemore's two productions, ''Kiss Me, Kate'' won the Tony for best musical revival and ''Copenhagen'' won for best play. ''Copenhagen,'' which deals with nuclear physics, was a striking venture for a Broadway increasingly known for playing it safe with splashy musicals.</p>
        <p>Also significant was the choice of ''Contact'' as best musical of the season, marking a dramatic shift in the definition of the American musical. A dance show performed to recorded music with no original score or live singing and little dialogue, ''Contact'' had generated considerable controversy in the last few weeks over whether it should qualify as a musical.</p>
        <p>Jack Goldstein, the executive director of the Theater Development Fund, which runs TKTS and theater support programs, resigned from the Tony nominating committee to protest the show's eligibility.</p>
        <p>The musicians' union, Local 802, also objected on the grounds that no music had been created for the production and no newly created musical performance occurs in the production.</p>
        <p>Bernard Gersten, the executive producer of the Lincoln Center Theater, which produced ''Contact,'' has dismissed such critics as ''forces of darkness.'' But in his acceptance speech last night, Mr. Gersten simply paid tribute to the cast of ''Contact,'' calling the dancers ''the true acrobats of the gods.''</p>
        <p>''Contact'' is not the only show that has challenged the musical genre this season. In ''James Joyce's 'The Dead,' '' characters sing Irish songs to one another at a Christmas party. ''Swing'' is a musical revue with some original songs and some standards. ''The Wild Party'' comes the closest to a conventional book musical, but some argue that it is more like an opera.</p>
        <p>Susan Stroman won for best choreography for ''Contact.'' She found herself competing against herself for best choreography and best direction of a musical, since she did both for ''Contact'' and for ''The Music Man.''</p>
        <p>In accepting the choreography award, she honored her husband, the director Mike Ockrent, who died of cancer in December.</p>
        <p>''Dance has lifts and dips and unexpected turns, just as real life does,'' she said. ''Had I not fallen in love with Mike Ockrent, I could not have written 'Contact.' ''</p>
        <p>The cast of ''Contact'' also fared well at the awards. Boyd Gaines, saying that ''the Tonys have been very good to me,'' accepted the third Tony Award of his career for his performance as a depressed ad executive who finds redemption through dance.</p>
        <p>Karen Ziemba, competing against fellow cast member Deborah Yates, won for her portrayal of a repressed housewife in another segment of the show.</p>
        <p>Tom Stoppard's ''The Real Thing'' had a big night, beating out ''A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' ''The Price'' and ''Amadeus'' for best revival. Among the producers on stage to accept the Tony was Harvey Weinstein of Miramax Films; ''The Real Thing'' marked the first time the movie company had helped back a Broadway show.</p>
        <p>A star of the play, Jennifer Ehle, won for best performance by a leading actress in a play, beating out her mother, Rosemary Harris, who was nominated for her performance in Noel Coward's ''Waiting in the Wings.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ehle's co-star, Stephen Dillane, also won the Tony, in a competitive category that included Gabriel Byrne of ''Moon for the Misbegotten,'' David Suchet of ''Amadeus'' and the two actors who alternate roles in ''True West,'' Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly. The producers of ''True West'' unsuccessfully tried to get the two actors in the Sam Shepard play to be considered jointly so that they would not compete against each other or cancel each other out.</p>
        <p>The award for best original score went to Elton John for ''Aida.'' The award was something of a consolation prize, given that the Disney show was not nominated for best musical. In what may have been a response to this slight, Mr. John did not attend the awards ceremony. Nor did the lyricist, Tim Rice.</p>
        <p>Heather Headley, the star of ''Aida,'' won the Tony for best performance by a leading actress in a musical. In her speech, Ms. Headley thanked Disney, which had previously employed her as Nala in ''The Lion King.'' ''I love you so much,'' she said. ''And I'll work for you for the rest of my life.''</p>
        <p>''Aida,'' with its contemporary renditions of ancient Egypt, also won for best scenic design (Bob Crowley) and for lighting design (Natasha Katz).</p>
        <p>In presenting the award for best costume design, Dame Edna Everage planted two big kisses on Martin Pakledinaz, who won for ''Kiss Me, Kate.'' Mr. Pakledinaz tried to keep a straight face -- despite its lipstick marks -- during his acceptance.</p>
        <p>''Kiss Me, Kate'' also won for orchestrations (Don Sebesky). And Brian Stokes Mitchell won the Tony for his performance as the male lead in the show. ''The Music Man,'' the main competition for ''Kate,'' was shut out. ''The Wild Party,'' which needed a victory to survive, also won no awards.</p>
        <p>For his performance as a curmudgeonly farmer father in the revival of Eugene O'Neill's ''A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' Roy Dotrice won the Tony for best performance by a featured actor in a play.</p>
        <p>Blair Brown won for her performance in ''Copenhagen.'' Like the director, Mr. Blakemore, Ms. Brown thanked the producers for their bravery in producing a play with such complex subject matter.</p>
        <p>''The Dead'' won the award for best book of a musical for Richard Nelson. The award was bittersweet given that the show -- unable to survive a drop in ticket sales -- has already closed on Broadway, although it will be produced at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles in July and then tour the country.</p>
        <p>Among this year's presenters were Kelsey Grammer, Susan Lucci, Kathie Lee Gifford, Jack Wagner and Carol Burnett, all television stars who appeared on Broadway this season or are about to -- Mr. Grammer is to open in ''Macbeth'' on June 15.</p>
        <p>To honor television stars who have been on Broadway, the opening number of the CBS Tony broadcast featured performers like Jesse L. Martin (formerly of ''Rent,'' recently a regular on ''Ally McBeal'') singing Broadway show tunes.</p>
        <p>Al Pacino, Matthew Broderick and Bebe Neuwirth also presented awards, as did Patrick Stewart, who is starring in ''The Ride Down Mount Morgan'' by Arthur Miller.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stewart made headlines recently when he complained from the stage about what he considered inadequate promotion by his show's producers, the Shubert Organization. The producers answered by filing charges with the Actors' Equity Association, which ruled that Mr. Stewart had to write an apology.</p>
        <p>In presenting the award for best revival of a play, Mr. Stewart said: ''What can I say? Nothing.''</p>
        <p>The Tony producers were clearly relieved to have Rosie O'Donnell back as host -- along with the comedic talents of Nathan Lane as ''special guest star'' -- given that ratings dropped without the popular talk show host last year.</p>
        <p>Last year's awards show was widely criticized, particularly its effort to honor straight plays with a montage of lines performed by actors from various productions, a presentation that was generally considered an indecipherable fiasco.</p>
        <p>This year's nominees, announced on May 8, were selected by a 24-member committee. The 705 Tony voters, comprising theater professionals and journalists, cast ballots in 21 categories.</p>
        <p>The Tonys are presented by the American Theater Wing, which founded the Tonys in 1947 and runs theater education programs, and the League of American Theaters and Producers, which represents Broadway producers.</p>
        <p>The first hour of the ceremony, broadcast on PBS, included a special Tony Award for regional theater, a grant of $25,000, which went to the nonprofit Utah Shakespearean Festival of Cedar City.</p>
        <p>The remaining two hours of the presentation were shown on CBS.</p>
        <p>A special Tony Award for lifetime achievement in the theater was given to the producer T. Edward Hambleton, founder of the Phoenix Theater. Another special award was given to ''Dame Edna: The Royal Tour,'' Barry Humphries's one-man/one-woman show at the Booth Theater. After greeting the crowd with her trademark ''Hello, Possums'' in presenting the award for best costume design, Dame Edna said, ''I'm the only Broadway show to be closing voluntarily.''</p>
        <p>In addition, Tony honors for excellence in the theater were given to the actress Eileen Heckart, who has been nominated for two Tony Awards in the past and recently starred in ''The Waverly Gallery'' Off Broadway; Sylvia Herscher, a theatrical agent and manager; and ''Encores!,'' the seven-year-old series at City Center.</p>
        <p>Broadway set a box office record this season, which ended May 28. Total gross was $602,596,528, according to Variety, up 2.46 percent from the previous season, with its total of 588,126,585. The number of playing weeks for the season also rose, to 1,452 from 1,440.</p>
        <p>This season's paid attendance of 11,365,309, however, was down 2.07 percent from the figure last season, which had set an all-time high of 11,605,278.</p>
