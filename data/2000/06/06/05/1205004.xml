        <p>Two and a half months ago, flush with victory in the primaries and eager to be seen as taking the high road, Vice President Al Gore sent an e-mail message to Gov. George W. Bush, proposing a ban on ''issue ads'' paid for with unregulated soft money.</p>

        <p>Two and a half months ago, flush with victory in the primaries and eager to be seen as taking the high road, Vice President Al Gore sent an e-mail message to Gov. George W. Bush, proposing a ban on ''issue ads'' paid for with unregulated soft money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, who had raised a staggering $70 million in his primary campaign, dismissed the challenge as a ploy. But now, with Democrats dropping hints that they may soon begin a television advertising campaign on behalf of Mr. Gore, Republicans are eager to hoist the vice president on his own petard.</p>
        <p>Asserting that Mr. Gore's message amounted to a promise not to use soft money, the Republicans are trying to paint Mr. Gore as a hypocrite even before the Democrats' first commercial hits the airwaves.</p>
        <p>In a June 1 letter to Ed Rendell, general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Jim Nicholson, the Republican national chairman, suggested that Democrats were poised to renege on the promise because Mr. Bush has been running ahead of Mr. Gore in some polls.</p>
        <p>''I'd ask you to tell the truth: Al Gore meant to keep his pledge only so long as it was beneficial to him politically,'' Mr. Nicholson wrote. ''That's why he's changed his mind now that he's fallen in the polls. That's why the D.N.C. is looking for any excuse, any loophole, any fine print to serve as justification for his clear intention to violate another pledge.''</p>
        <p>The Republicans made Mr. Nicholson's letter available to reporters before it was sent. And to some who monitor the gamesmanship between the parties, it appeared that the Republicans were seeking to enlist on the side of the angels on a confusing and complex issue in which neither party could claim purity.</p>
        <p>In fact, Democratic officials point out, obscure groups with ties to the Republican Party are already running commercials in California and Washington, D.C., that are intended to tar Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''The bottom line here is that both the Bush campaign and the Gore campaign are planning to spend tens of millions of dollars on these illicit soft money ads in this election,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a Washington group that advocates campaign finance reform. ''I don't know that voters should care about this game of 'got you,' but they should deeply care about the huge amounts of six-figure campaign contributions that in the end are going to be spent.''</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Gore, though, who set the game in motion with his e-mail message to Mr. Bush on March 14.</p>
        <p>''I challenge you to accept my proposal that we both reject the use of soft money to run issue ads,'' Mr. Gore wrote. ''I will take the first step by requesting the Democratic National Committee not to run any issue ads paid for by soft money unless and until the Republican Party uses money for advertising.''</p>
        <p>Republicans are still smarting from the 1996 campaign, when the Democrats ran a pre-emptive series of issue advertisements on behalf of President Clinton well before the conventions that did substantial damage to Bob Dole's candidacy.</p>
        <p>''In a period when Dole was low on cash,'' said Nelson Warfield, a Republican consultant who served as press secretary for the Dole campaign, ''the Clinton-Gore team was able to define him as an extremist, when in fact Dole was a mainstream Republican.''</p>
        <p>This year, the large-scale use of party-sponsored commercials has yet to occur. But Republican officials are trying to hold Mr. Gore accountable for his offer, saying that in the e-mail message and in some slightly stronger statements on TV news programs, Mr. Gore has made a pledge not to use soft money.</p>
        <p>But aides to Mr. Gore said that just as in the case of a challenge to former Senator Bill Bradley to forgo commercials during the primaries, Mr. Gore's proposal was contingent on an agreement with his opponent.</p>
        <p>''Anyone who saw Bush's response to the Gore challenge knows the Bush campaign has not taken it seriously from Day 1,'' said Chris Lehane, press secretary for the Gore campaign. ''I think for Jim Nicholson to suddenly be trying to get on the moral high ground is laughable.''</p>
        <p>In the last four years, issue advertising -- ostensibly intended to promote a cause rather than a person -- has become a ubiquitous tool in Congressional and presidential races. The advertisements are often virtual echoes of the commercials that the candidates run, but they avoid terms like ''vote for'' or ''defeat.'' These words, the courts have found, constitute electioneering, and would make them subject to the strictures of the Federal Election Commission. Issue advertisements paid for with soft money have no financial disclosure requirements.</p>
        <p>Republicans clearly want Mr. Gore to pay a political price should the Democratic National Committee begin a blitz of issue advertising.</p>
        <p>''From Gore's standpoint,'' Mr. Wertheimer said, ''this is not a pledge he should have made, and obviously, it was made to score points. Now Bush is trying to use it to score points of his own.''</p>
        <p>Democrats contend that Mr. Bush and his allies long ago violated the spirit of Mr. Gore's overture. They say that over the last several weeks, the Republicans have made clear that their general-election television strategy will be to have the Bush campaign run upbeat commercials while leaving the attack advertising in the hands of little-known interest groups. (More established organizations, like the Sierra Club and the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, are running spots attacking Mr. Bush.)</p>
        <p>Democrats point, for example, to a recent $1.5 million anti-Gore campaign on television in California by Shape the Debate, a group formed by associates of Pete Wilson, the former governor and a Republican, and to a more recent series of commercials being run on cable television in Washington. Sponsored by an organization called the Coalition to Protect Americans Now, the latest 30-second commercial, unveiled this week, criticizes the administration's handling of America's nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>''Truman stood up to the Kremlin and saved Berlin,'' an announcer says. ''J.F.K. stared down Soviet missiles in Cuba. Reagan toppled a Soviet wall and empire. But Clinton and Gore would give the Kremlin veto power over American missile defenses.''</p>
        <p>Jennifer Backus, a Democratic National Committee spokeswoman, said the commercials were part of a ''stealth campaign'' by Republicans to attack Mr. Gore without having to reveal the source of the money used to pay for the advertisements.</p>
        <p>Frank Gaffney, head of the advisory board for the Coalition to Protection Americans Now, said the group was formed four months ago to invigorate discussion on security issues, not to derail a candidate.</p>
        <p>''The organization is in no way connected to the Bush campaign,'' Mr. Gaffney said. ''People that I am very close to and have worked with are advising Bush. But that is in no way translated into any kind of coordination.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 10, 2000, Saturday  An article on Monday about soft money and the presidential campaign misstated a Federal Election Commission requirement for reporting how the contributions are used in issue advertising. The national party committees must disclose all receipts and expenses arising from unrestricted soft money donations. Issue advertisements, which may be paid for in part with soft money, are not exempt from disclosure requirements.</p>
