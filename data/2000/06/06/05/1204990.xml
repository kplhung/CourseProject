        <p>The Reisinger Knockout Team Championship, long the brightest jewel in the calendar of the Greater New York Bridge Association, was played last week and ended in confusion. As a result of a complex combination of circumstances, there was, for the first time in the 71-year history of the event, no final.</p>
        <p>In bygone years 70 teams or more entered for the Reisinger. Because many other team games are now offered, that number has dwindled steadily, and only 11 expert groups began play a week ago. The final was provisionally scheduled to be played on Saturday, but that was going to present a problem. Several of the players were entered in the International Team Trials which began yesterday in Memphis.</p>
        <p>Those players, due to travel Saturday, expected that the final would be postponed, which has sometimes happened in similar circumstances. One of the players was Adam Wildavsky, whose team reached the final. With Debbie Rosenberg, John Fout, Phillip Alder, Dorothy Truscott and this writer, he won a semifinal match by 28 imps on Friday night at Honors Club against a team led by Richard De Martino.</p>
        <p>But in the other semifinal a foursome consisting of John Roberts, August Boehm, George Tornay and Saul Bronstein snatched a victory by three imps against Richard Schwartz and his team. For various reasons, the primary one being that Bronstein lives in Florida, the Roberts team was unwilling to reschedule the final at a later date. The captains agreed that the final should be deemed a draw, and there are now joint Reisinger champions.</p>
        <p>On the diagramed deal, Roberts found himself in four hearts with the opening lead of the spade queen. Since the opposing diamonds were evenly divided, three no-trump would have survived. In four spades there were nine top tricks, with a chance of a 10th in one of the black suits. The right theoretical play was to win the spade ace, draw trumps and lead the spade five. As it happens that would have produced 10 tricks immediately, with the club ace available after the spades were unblocked. But if West played low promptly on the second spade lead, South might play the king and continue the suit, succeeding with an even split or if the nine fell. Slightly better -- and clearly so if there was a fractional hesitation from West -- South could finesse the eight, gaining if West began with a holding headed by Q J 9 and still succeeding with an even split.</p>
        <p>In practice South made an imaginative play by allowing the spade queen to win the first trick. As he hoped, West understandably continued with the spade jack. Now it was easy to win the spade ace, draw trumps and cash the spade 10. The club ace and the spade king gave South his contract. In the replay the same 10 tricks were made, but the contract was three hearts.</p>
        <p>Roberts's play gave the defense a small window of opportunity. An inspired shift to clubs, with or without the play of a diamond winner or two, would have beaten the game. Instead of gaining six imps and winning the match eventually by three, his team would have lost by nine and a great deal of subsequent scheduling difficulty would have been avoided.</p>
        <p>The Flight B Reisinger Teams was won by Alfred Lewis, Eric Mock, Robert Factor and David Robinson, who defeated Franco Baseggio and his team in the final.</p>
