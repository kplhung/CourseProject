        <p>The Mets made no announcement, but Jason Tyner, a Norfolk Tides outfielder who was their first-round draft pick two years ago, was told yesterday to go to New York, where he is expected to become the Mets' leadoff hitter.</p>
        <p>''This is what I've been working for since I was 5 years old,'' Tyner said in Norfolk, Va. ''I still have a lot to learn and can get a lot better, but my game is a lot different from a lot of peoples' games. I'm about getting on base and playing defense.''</p>

        <p>The Mets made no announcement, but Jason Tyner, a Norfolk Tides outfielder who was their first-round draft pick two years ago, was told yesterday to go to New York, where he is expected to become the Mets' leadoff hitter.</p>
        <p>''This is what I've been working for since I was 5 years old,'' Tyner said in Norfolk, Va. ''I still have a lot to learn and can get a lot better, but my game is a lot different from a lot of peoples' games. I'm about getting on base and playing defense.''</p>
        <p>Tyner had 49 stolen bases for Class AA Binghamton last season and was leading the Class AAA International League this season with 27 stolen bases. Tyner, a left-handed hitter, was second in the league in batting at .347. He hit .371 when he led off innings. The 23-year-old Texan played center field until Melvin Mora recently visited Norfolk on an injury rehabilitation assignment. Tyner switched to left, and team officials thought he looked even better there than in center.</p>
