        <p>To lose to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays yesterday, the Mets had to summon demons that had been chased away long ago in the Bobby Valentine regime.</p>
        <p>The Devil Rays tormented the Mets in a 15-5 victory -- the highest score against the Mets this season, and equaling Tampa Bay's club record.</p>
        <p>Imagine yielding a home run to a pitcher who had never been to the plate in his professional career -- on the first pitch he saw.</p>
        <p>Or imagine seeing the Gold Glove third baseman Robin Ventura, distracted by a broken bat that arrived at the same time as a ground ball, throwing the ball away to start a five-run sixth inning that broke the game open.</p>
        <p>Later that inning, Ventura, as well as shortstop Kurt Abbott, bobbled balls that could have resulted in inning-saving double plays.</p>
        <p>And to top it off, the Devil Rays scored an additional five unearned runs two innings later after loading the bases on two hit batsmen and an error.</p>
        <p>But the Mets, who captured the first two games of the weekend series, get another chance tonight against another weak American League East team when the Orioles come to Shea for the start of a three-game series. And then there is the annual interborough soap opera against the Yankees next weekend.</p>
        <p>The Mets had started this series with baseball's second-best record (30-21) in interleague play. They also have been a successful home team this season, winning almost twice as often as their opposition. And the Devil Rays? Baseball's worst team, quite simply, a team that has won only once in every three games on the road.</p>
        <p>But the Devil Rays unveiled some surprises, including a hitter named Estaban Yan. He was also the starting pitcher, though he had never had an at-bat in a professional game. Not even in the minors, and certainly not in his previous 132 games in the major leagues. Sure, he said in a charming accent, he had at-bats before ''in school in the Dominican.''</p>
        <p>Before the game, Valentine was assessing Yan as a hitter. After all, what did the Mets know about this 25-year-old who had never been to the plate?</p>
        <p>''We suspect the guy today isn't a hitter,'' Valentine said. ''He's never done the National League thing and he's a young hitter.''</p>
        <p>So in the second inning, the Mets starter Bobby J. Jones could be forgiven if he thought he had an easy out, especially after Felix Martinez had launched a two-run home run (on a 1-2 pitch) to propel the visitors to a 2-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Up stepped Yan, oblivious to the fact that only 11 pitchers in the history of baseball had ever homered in their first at-bat, and none had done it in eight years.</p>
        <p>''I said to myself, 'I got a chance,' '' Yan said. ''I feel comfortable. I feel I want to swing at the first pitch. He try to throw a strike. He figures I'm an easy out.''</p>
        <p>And so on the first pitch he had seen in an at-bat in a game since his teenage years, and after seven seasons of pro ball, Yan swung at the first pitch, a fastball. He drilled it almost 370 feet over the left-center field wall.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't trying to throw a fastball down the middle by any means,'' Jones said. ''Anyone with a bat in his hands is dangerous.''</p>
        <p>That 3-0 edge, though, does not mean much for a team that struggles as much as the Devil Rays do. Jones recovered to pitch three straight scoreless innings, and the Mets scored four times to take a 4-3 lead into the sixth. Mike Piazza, in his second game back after being sidelined with a concussion, knocked home two of the runs.</p>
        <p>But then came the Devil Rays' five-run assault in the sixth. They knocked out Jones, the eventual loser, even though he said he had felt better about his fastball and slider yesterday than he had previously this season.</p>
        <p>Reliever Pat Mahomes, who followed Jones, was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the seventh. And then his relief, Rich Rodriguez, was the victim of his own and his teammates' sloppiness in the crushing eighth inning.</p>
        <p>Rodriguez hit two players. Abbott threw a ball away. That set the stage for the five unearned runs, including Bubba Trammell's third pinch-hit homer of the season, a three-run blast.</p>
        <p>Yan, who got the victory for his five-inning stint, was magnanimous.</p>
        <p>Told about Valentine's assessment, the pitcher said: ''He may be right. Maybe I got lucky this time. I'm very excited.''</p>
