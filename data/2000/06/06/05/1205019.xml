        <p>MANY of the worst photographs are kept in a red paper folder on the coffee table in the ambassador's office.</p>
        <p>As some diplomats might want to share photographs of a sun-dappled tourist resort or a new business development in their homelands, Ambassador John E. Leigh asks visitors to the Sierra Leone Embassy to inspect the evidence of the nightmare that has descended on his West African nation.</p>
        <p>He takes the first photograph from the folder. ''Here, what has she done to deserve this?'' he asks of the child in the photo, a girl not more than 3 or 4 years old. Her belly is covered with scars from blade cuts. Most of her right arm is missing, removed from above the elbow.</p>
        <p>''They just put your arm on the ground and chop it off,'' he says of the grotesque tactics of the rebels who have mutilated whole villages of people, including infants, by hacking off their limbs, in an undeniably successful effort to spread terror. A second photograph shows a pretty young woman, perhaps 20, with two stumps where her hands had been.</p>
        <p>Thousands of other civilians have been killed outright in almost a decade of fighting in Sierra Leone, a diamond-rich nation of five million whose history is bound up with that of the United States. Much of the population is descended from American slaves who fought their way off Southern plantations and returned to Africa.</p>
        <p>The ambassador, an American-educated lawyer-turned-diplomat who has run the embassy since 1996, said he did not believe the first reports of the mutilations when they began to trickle out early that year. ''I was stunned by it; I thought it was a made-up story,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But quickly enough, the evidence became overwhelming. ''When they chop off people's hands, they will say to the victims, 'Let's see how you're going to vote now,' '' Mr. Leigh explained. ''In Sierra Leone, people are in a state of shock. Nobody thought that fellow Africans could be this vicious.''</p>
        <p>The extreme violence, he said, is explained by the diamonds, which the rebels -- who have received support from Libya and neighboring Liberia -- seek to control. ''The greedier you are, the more violent you are,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Despite the scale of atrocities, the ambassador said, it has been difficult to get Americans, including officials of the Clinton administration, to listen and care. ''It's just not important to them. Sierra Leone is small, the economy is tiny.'' As for the State Department, he said, ''They listen to me but they do nothing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leigh said a possibly racist double standard became clear last year, when Sierra Leone continued its descent into chaos as the United States began its multibillion-dollar military campaign in Kosovo. ''Here is a white nation getting all of these goodies, and here is Sierra Leone, where they are cutting off the arms of women and children, and they are not paying any attention.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps worse, he said, the United States joined with other nations last year in pressuring his government to negotiate, producing a cease-fire agreement in which the government pardoned the guerrillas who had been mutilating civilians. After the deal was signed, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright traveled to Sierra Leone and met with the rebel leader, Foday Sankoh. The agreement has collapsed.</p>
        <p>''We were forced into it,'' Mr. Leigh said. ''The United States went in and pushed it on us.'' Not surprisingly, he is unpopular across town at the State Department. ''They give me dirty looks,'' he said with a throaty chuckle. ''They don't like me there because I speak out.''</p>
        <p>Asked for a response, a department official said the United States had provided more than $300 million in humanitarian aid to Sierra Leone over the last decade.</p>
        <p>''The notion that we haven't done very much is certainly erroneous,'' the official said, adding that the United States had not pressed the peace agreement on Sierra Leone but had instead been an honest broker at the request of the government there.</p>
        <p>To the 61-year-old ambassador, the anger he arouses is simply proof that he is doing his job. His government asked Mr. Leigh to take over the embassy in the hope that after spending most of his adult life in the United States, he would know how to make his voice heard.</p>
        <p>HIS family ties to the United States go back to the 18th century, when his ancestors escaped from Southern plantations and, according to family accounts, fled to Nova Scotia and eventually to Sierra Leone. ''Sierra Leone was a place for the guys who were rebellious,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leigh grew up in Freetown, his country's capital, and was educated at American-  and British-run missionary schools. His father worked for what was then the British colonial government. Like many from elite families, Mr. Leigh went to college in the West. He received an M.B.A. from New York University and a law degree from Suffolk University in Boston.</p>
        <p>Over the years, he married an American, had three children, all of them American citizens, and worked for Chase Manhattan and Xerox. When he was tapped to become ambassador, he was a lawyer in private practice in Boston.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Leigh says he has no desire for American citizenship. An American passport, he said, would dishonor the memory of relatives who had to risk their lives centuries ago to escape the United States.</p>
        <p>''My wife has been on my case,'' he said. ''But I didn't feel right doing that. My ancestors fought their way out of America's slave population. I didn't want to negate that heritage.''</p>
