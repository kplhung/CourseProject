        <p>Theodore Jay Miller reply to Cardinal Roger Mahony's June 2 letter holds right to choose means right to choose whether or not to have abortion</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Let me clarify Cardinal Roger Mahony's ''clarity'' on the right to choose (letter, June 2). This right is not just the right to have an abortion; it's the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion.</p>
        <p>A pregnant woman who chooses to have a child is exercising the same right as one who chooses to terminate her pregnancy; it's a ''seamless cloth,'' a single right protected by Roe v. Wade. If it's a woman's choice to make, then the government can't force her in either direction, no matter who she is.</p>

        <p>And if this is changed, so that it's not a woman's choice, then the government will choose whether or not a woman gets an abortion, and it may well force choices on women that someone like Cardinal Mahony will find objectionable.</p>
