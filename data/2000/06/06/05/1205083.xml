        <p>Kobe Bryant lofted it high, a lob headed for one of two places: the top of the backboard or beyond. Shaquille O'Neal leaped and caught the ball on the right side of the rim. He cocked and dunked in one ferocious motion, setting off tremors inside the Staples Center.</p>
        <p>The building was still vibrating tonight after the young supernovas of the Los Angeles Lakers passed their finals, the greatest test of their careers.</p>
        <p>Moments from suffering their most devastating playoff loss -- a defeat so agonizing it would take a National Basketball Association title to live it down -- O'Neal and Bryant showed the kind of resolve that can secure a championship.</p>
        <p>The Lakers rebounded from a 16-point deficit late in the third quarter, coming back against the Portland Trail Blazers in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals and winning a pulsating thriller, 89-84.</p>
        <p>''Well, no one remembers who finished second 10 years down the road,'' said Coach Phil Jackson, whose team will play host to Indiana in Game 1 of the N.B.A. finals on Wednesday night. ''The reality is when you get here, you're going to win it, and we may have learned enough at this point to know how to do it.''</p>
        <p>The end came so suddenly for Portland, which did not score a basket during a 7-minute-30-second stretch in the fourth quarter and failed to become only the seventh team in league history to rebound from a 3-1 series deficit.</p>
        <p>''This is what you live for,'' said Bryant, whose 25 points, 11 rebounds, 7 assists and 4 blocked shots led the Lakers.</p>
        <p>''These are the backyard-type of situations you dream about when you're young. Two minutes to go. Game on the line. Tie score.''</p>
        <p>That is about how it went. With O'Neal unable to get free inside for most of the evening, Bryant had the defining game of his career. With the score tied at 79, he made two free throws with 1:34 left and then sank a 16-footer from the left wing with 1:09 remaining to push the lead to 4 points.</p>
        <p>After Portland's Rasheed Wallace missed two free throws with 1:25, Bryant drove the middle of the lane and at the last possible second lofted an alley-oop pass for his 7-foot-1-inch, 330-pound teammate.</p>
        <p>O'Neal, who scored 9 of his 18 points in the final period, caught the ball with his right hand, cocked it and dunked maliciously -- a basket that made the score 85-79 with 41.3 seconds left and turned the arena into a state of extended delirium.</p>
        <p>''It was like Shaq dropped out of the roof when he threw that down,'' said Rick Fox, a Lakers reserve forward. ''Just devastating.''</p>
        <p>Bryant said: ''It was a pass all the way. I thought I threw the ball pretty high, and Shaq went up and got it.''</p>
        <p>That dunk sent the Lakers into the finals. But how close they came to vacationing this week.</p>
        <p>Brian Shaw made it possible. The Lakers' reserve guard hit two pivotal 3-pointers during 15-0 run in the quarter, including a bomb from the left wing with 4:02 remaining that severely damaged Portland's confidence.</p>
        <p>That shot tied the score at 75 and sent the crowd into a tizzy. Shaw, a former teammate of O'Neal's at Orlando who was traded by the Blazers to Houston as a minor piece in the deal for Scottie Pippen last summer, was picked up by the Lakers after the Rockets released him.</p>
        <p>''I realized that we sort of made cowards of ourselves in the fourth quarter,'' said Pippen, who scored 3 points and missed 6 of 7 shots after the first first quarter. ''We played like we were fatigued, and they gained the momentum that they needed to pull this game out.''</p>
        <p>The Lakers had inspiration. O'Neal pulled some of his teammates aside after Jackson spoke to the team between the third and fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>''I told them, 'We've come too far to let this thing just end like this,' '' O'Neal said. ''I said: 'Let's fight, let's scratch, let's claw and let's play. Let's play.' That was it.''</p>
        <p>Not exactly. O'Neal also mentioned that the Blazers were not going to let him shoot, so he was going to have to rely on his teammates more by distributing the ball to open shooters when he was double- and triple-teamed near the basket.</p>
        <p>''And Brian Shaw looked at me and said, 'Yeah, just like Orlando' '' O'Neal said. ''When he said, 'Just like Orlando,' I knew his shot was going to be on.''</p>
        <p>The Shaw-Shaq Redemption, the combination was once called. And it worked resilient wonders tonight in the final 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>Before the end, the Lakers, who played an awful first half, were on the precipice of being blown out. They trailed, 75-59, mostly because Wallace, who led the Blazers with 30 points, and Steve Smith could not miss from the perimeter.</p>
        <p>A Los Angeles-Indiana series -- the only matchup that could save the league from an all-small-market finals and perhaps the worst televised ratings in the modern era -- was beginning to look bleak.</p>
        <p>The Lakers missed 17 free throws, but they sank the ones that mattered. O'Neal made 8 of 12 in the game, including two with 2:44 left to help book his first trip to the finals since 1995, when he played for Orlando.</p>
        <p>''We were just letting them warm up before we got started,'' he said, smiling. ''O.K., I'm lying.''</p>
