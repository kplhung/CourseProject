        <p>As the ferry returning from Ellis Island toots its horn, pigeons take off amid their own applause, fishermen watch their lines for signs of life, and a steel drum sounds above the rushing of the tide, which roars up through manholes in the promenade.

        <p>This evening, new art will be unveiled that incorporates that variety of experience found only in the Battery -- its life and history, human and natural, above and below the surface.

Part of the recently rebuilt railing at the prow of Manhattan, the series of 37 pieces is named after the Hudson: ''The River That Flows Two Ways.''

        <p>As the ferry returning from Ellis Island toots its horn, pigeons take off amid their own applause, fishermen watch their lines for signs of life, and a steel drum sounds above the rushing of the tide, which roars up through manholes in the promenade. Skyscrapers loom behind vast open spaces of park and river.</p>
        <p>This evening, new art will be unveiled that incorporates that variety of experience found only in the Battery -- its life and history, human and natural, above and below the surface. The two-square-foot screens of cast-iron and bronze openwork were created by Wopo Holup, a Manhattan artist. Part of the recently rebuilt railing at the prow of Manhattan, the series of 37 pieces is named after the Hudson: ''The River That Flows Two Ways.'' The river flows through it, a visible, moving background to the metal forms.</p>
        <p>''We want to get people to fall in love with the Battery again, and figured one of the best ways to do it was to tell stories,'' said Warrie Price, president of the Conservancy for Historic Battery Park, which helped pay for the project.</p>
        <p>On a tour of the 1,500-foot promenade, Ms. Price pointed out panels showing Fort Amsterdam, the city's first permanent structure, built in 1643. (Even then, residents of the city spoke 18 languages.) Nearby Trinity Church, seen in another panel, had the right to any fish or whale washing ashore, bolstering its coffers with oil and meat revenue.</p>
        <p>After the War of 1812, Castle Clinton, built to defend New York Harbor, became Castle Garden, an arts center where Jenny Lind sang for 6,000 people in 1850. Five years later it served as the entry point for immigrants, before Ellis Island did. Herman Melville lived two blocks away. And not far away, the Statue of Liberty, Charles Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart, Pope John Paul II and the first men on the moon were all honored with ticker tape in the Canyon of Heroes.</p>
        <p>Under a bronze band representing the river, most panels also show the wildlife beneath the surface, swimming westward, while the human story progresses eastward. Even the river creatures have their stories. Sturgeon descended from a fish group 100 million years older than the dinosaurs, and American eels swim 1,000 miles offshore.</p>
        <p>Ms. Holup was drawn to the vitality of the spot and the people who have made history there.</p>
        <p>''I knew it was the pivotal point for the United States of America as we know it now,'' she said, recalling how lower Manhattan was part of what Henry Hudson saw when he first arrived and where the island's natives must have stood when they caught sight of the European explorer.</p>
        <p>''My inspiration was: What might anybody who stood on that point have seen over eons?'' she said. The sculptures encourage visitors to the tip of Manhattan to imagine they are joining ''a chain 400 generations long,'' according to the installation's interpretive guide.</p>
        <p>She envisioned sculptures done in open lacework.</p>
        <p>''If you stand on the promenade, you have to look through it and see the harbor,'' she said. ''And if you're on a boat when it's coming back, what you see through it is all the people on the promenade, rollerskating and walking.''</p>
        <p>Over the last decade, Ms. Holup has created several other public works of art in the city. She designed bas-relief sculptures for the elevated stations on the 1 and 9 subway line from 125th Street to 231st Street and sculptures at two public schools, P.S. 92 in Corona and P.S. 370 in Brighton Beach. And tomorrow she will be working on installing an eight-story high bas-relief on the side of a research building at the University of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington.</p>
        <p>While creating the Battery sculptures, she received guidance from the Hudson River Foundation, the American Museum of Natural History and local historians, some of whom she had over for dinner.</p>
        <p>''Kenneth Jackson had a very hard time with one of the panels,'' Ms. Holup said -- the one featuring the Flying Dutchman, the phantom ship. She recalled that Mr. Jackson, the editor of The Encyclopedia of New York City, said the existence of the ship could not be verified.</p>
        <p>Another writer who had come to dinner, Tony Hiss, responded to these concerns when he wrote the interpretive guide for the sculptures. ''Sometimes,'' he wrote, ''the stories and tall tales we tell each other more truly describes feelings buried in memory than mere facts can relay.''</p>
        <p>The sculptures will be unveiled this evening at 7 p.m., when the Conservancy for Historic Battery Park honors Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan for his support of rebuilding the park and Castle Clinton.</p>
        <p>The $300,000 sculpture project is financed in part by the Hanover Square Pilot Funds, the Greenacre Foundation, the New York State Environmental Protection Fund and the Starr Foundation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Price, the Conservancy's president, hopes the art and other improvements to the park will draw more people to the Battery, to savor its histories, myths and soul-widening vistas.</p>
        <p>''You should feel the sacred sense of this landscape after you come here,'' Ms. Price said, ''with the push and pull of what we do above the water, and what we do below.''</p>
