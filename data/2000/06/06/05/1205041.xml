        <p>With touchstone issues like death penalty challenges, school financing and changes in liability laws hanging in the balance, contests for state judgeships around the country have become bruising multimillion-dollar political affairs that critics say are threatening the independence of the nation's state courts.</p>
        <p>Millions of dollars in campaign contributions is flowing into races for top state judgeships this year, while candidates are testing the limits of ethics rules that forbid them to signal how they might vote on cases, judicial candidates, political consultants and lawyers across the country say.</p>
        <p>Attack advertising, the use of aggressive political consultants and what are often only thinly veiled promises to sustain or overturn controversial decisions are now established parts of campaigns for seats on state courts.</p>
        <p>''Judicial campaigns are getting noisier, nastier and costlier,'' said Roy A. Schotland, an expert on judicial politics who is a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. ''The amount of money being spent keeps escalating, and the number of states in which this is happening is escalating.''</p>
        <p>In Ohio this year, more than $5 million and possibly as much as $12 million may be spent in a battle for a seat on the State Supreme Court. The campaign, one of the most bitterly contested in the country, could shift the ideological balance of the court. Twenty years ago, a campaign for the same court cost $100,000.</p>
        <p>Races for State Supreme Courts in Michigan, Illinois, Alabama, Idaho and other states are also drawing national attention. Already this year, supreme court races have included accusations of race baiting, dirty politics, catering to rich trial lawyers and abdication to business interests.</p>
        <p>The intensity of the races, legal and political experts say, indicates that the big-dollar judicial politicking that gained momentum in the 1980's with campaigns that ousted top judges in Texas and California, among others, has become an entrenched part of the political system in some of the more than 40 states that elect judges.</p>
        <p>One reason may be the polarization that has affected government at all levels, creating an ever more vibrant cottage industry of political consultants and advisers. Also, as the federal government has become less ambitious in seeking solutions to social problems, in the eras of Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton, the states have become battlegrounds for emotional issues like abortion, health care and the financing of public schools. And many of those issues are now starting to land in the state trial and appeals courts.</p>
        <p>Efforts to limit liability lawsuits and damage awards in many state legislatures -- so-called tort reform  -- have also accelerated the political forces at work on state courts. The measures, which often place a maximum on damage awards and otherwise limit recoveries by people claiming injury, have spawned challenges in many state courts, which, in turn, have spawned campaigns by trial lawyers and business groups to shift those courts their way.</p>
        <p>But the issues in statewide judicial races are unpredictably diverse. In the Alabama race for chief justice of the Supreme Court, for example, a candidate who posted the Ten Commandments in his courtroom has built a huge following.</p>
        <p>In the Idaho race last month, a trial judge unseated an incumbent Supreme Court justice for the first time since 1944 after an extraordinarily bitter campaign in which the winner had declared that the theory of evolution could not be true.</p>
        <p>In Illinois, two Democratic judges vying for a seat on the State Supreme Court this spring each spent $1 million in campaigns that included pummeling each other in television advertising. One suggested the other was responsible for sending ''innocent men to death row while killers walk the street.'' The other warned voters that ''one candidate has taken the low road.''</p>
        <p>Party Battle in Michigan</p>
        <p>The Michigan race this year was superheated even before the Democratic Party had selected its three candidates to oppose three sitting Republican justices. The three conservative incumbents were originally appointed by Gov. John Engler, also a Republican, to fill vacancies.</p>
        <p>Business groups had declared the election of the incumbent justices a priority, while unions and trial lawyers had begun gathering a war chest for the Democrats.</p>
        <p>Last month, tensions exploded publicly over a flier handed out by the State Democratic Party at a dinner of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Detroit. Among other accusations, the flier declared that one of the three incumbents, Robert P. Young Jr., who is black, opposed the 1954 United States Supreme Court decision desegregating public schools, Brown v. Board of Education.</p>
        <p>The flier said that the three Republicans who are part of a majority on the court were active in the conservative Federalist Society and went on to assert that Justice Young was a ''staunch believer that Brown v. Board of Education was wrong.''</p>
        <p>Justice Young responded by releasing a scathing letter he wrote to the State Democratic Party chairman, Mark Brewer. It demanded a retraction of the accusation about his views on the opinion. ''This statement is a lie,'' intended to harm him with black voters, the justice said.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Justice Young said he had long publicly supported the desegregation ruling. He asserted that he had said he simply shared the views of some critics who say it was based ''too much on sociology.''</p>
        <p>His public response, Justice Young said, was ''a moral call to conscience about whether race baiting has any role in the political discourse in a judicial election.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Brewer, the Democratic chairman, said there would be no retraction and that civil rights would continue to be an issue. ''It is not a lie,'' Mr. Brewer said of the flier's description of Justice Young's views. ''It is true. He has told a number of people throughout Michigan that Brown v. Board of Education was 'wrongly decided.' Those were his exact words.''</p>
        <p>Some of the court's critics say that despite the vitriol over the landmark civil rights case, the real issue is the court's reputation as a harshly conservative panel that regularly sides with business, prosecutors and insurance companies. The critics say Justice Young's reaction may have been partly to distract attention from criticism of the court.</p>
        <p>One source of that criticism was an analysis of 57 of the court's rulings last year. The analysis was published in a union newspaper, Michigan A.F.L.-C.I.O. News, and then described in a newspaper for Michigan lawyers, Lawyers Weekly.</p>
        <p>In an interview, the article's author, Mary Ellen Gurewitz, the general counsel of the Michigan A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the State Democratic Party, said the results were ''stunningly one-sided'' with criminal defendants, for example, losing 15 out of 15 cases decided by the Michigan Supreme Court. People claiming injuries lost 12 out of 13 cases she examined.</p>
        <p>Several of the Republican justices have countered that Ms. Gurewitz's analysis was a politically motivated attack on the court and a manipulation of statistics.</p>
        <p>An Ouster in Idaho</p>
        <p>In Idaho this year one explosive issue in the judicial campaign was water rights.</p>
        <p>An incumbent State Supreme Court justice, Cathy Silak, who had been appointed by a Democratic governor, riled conservatives by writing the majority opinion last year in a 3-2 decision that said the federal government, not the state, controlled water rights in certain wilderness areas.</p>
        <p>Her opponent was a trial judge, Daniel Eismann, who was known for conservatism and was unusually open in expressing some views. Judge Eismann described his campaign as a challenge to judges who ''legislate from the bench.'' And in the campaign he told reporters that he was morally opposed to abortion.</p>
        <p>After Judge Eismann's lopsided victory on May 23, in which he drew 59 percent of the vote, he answered questions about remarks he made in the campaign about his views of creationism. ''I can prove scientifically,'' he said in an interview, ''that evolution has not and cannot occur.''</p>
        <p>In the election, Justice Silak, who years ago had volunteered as a coordinator for the state branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, quickly became a target of conservative critics. She was a subject of advertising by proponents of term limits and opponents of gun control and was even the target of an aggressive campaign tactic known as a push poll in which the questioner includes negative information to discourage support of an opponent.</p>
        <p>One newspaper advertisement placed by a supporter of Judge Eismann said in huge letters: ''Will partial-birth abortion and same-sex marriage become legal in Idaho? Perhaps so, if liberal Supreme Court Justice Cathy Silak remains on the Idaho Supreme Court.''</p>
        <p>Justice Silak said her record as a volunteer for the civil liberties group had been distorted. She described her judicial record as moderate and said she had never expressed views about same-sex marriage or partial-birth abortion.</p>
        <p>''You now have the active involvement of political parties and special interest groups and individuals with special axes to grind,'' she said. ''I think it is a way of getting some hand-selected judges on the court so you have judges whose opinions you have essentially bought.''</p>
        <p>Judge Eismann said Justice Silak's assertion did not merit a response. He said he had no connection to the activities of many of the groups that had opposed her.</p>
        <p>Judges as Politicians</p>
        <p>In the new judicial politics, judges sometimes appear as petty as other politicians -- and as subject to influence.</p>
        <p>In a boisterous $1.3 million campaign last year in Wisconsin, the state's chief justice, Shirley S. Abrahamson, was forced to explain, for example, why she had once allowed a late-night aerobics class in the court's ornate hearing room.</p>
        <p>Chief Justice Abrahamson said the exercise class had been a ''morale builder'' for her aides.</p>
        <p>She won re-election, although there was widespread concern that the court had been harmed by a campaign that divided the justices. Four of her colleagues broke the unspoken precedent that typically keeps justices outside the political fray, and openly supported Chief Justice Abrahamson's well-financed opponent.</p>
        <p>The four suggested they were opposed to Chief Justice Abrahamson's management style, but there was speculation that one of the four would have liked to have succeeded her.</p>
        <p>Across the country, there are significant consequences to judges taking on the persona of politicians, said Anthony Champagne, a political science professor and expert on the judiciary at the University of Texas at Dallas. In many states, until the 1980's, the appointment or election of judges was arranged through quiet agreements among politicians and bar associations.</p>
        <p>''It is a new system,'' Professor Champagne said, ''where lots of money is involved, where judges are highly dependent on their political parties and political operatives and where judges are tempted to make promises that might affect their judicial decisions. It is something that is new in America, and it has the potential of being a really corrupting force.''</p>
        <p>The politicking is becoming increasingly explicit. As the battle over liability laws has moved into the courts in the last few years, business groups and their trial lawyer adversaries have been increasingly open in describing the battle to win judgeships in bald political terms.</p>
        <p>In a newsletter last fall, for example, the Michigan Manufacturers Association told its members about the importance of this year's State Supreme Court election. The newsletter flatly outlined the group's political goal. In the last election, it boasted, contributions from the manufacturers' political action committee ''swayed the Supreme Court election to a conservative viewpoint, ensuring a pro-manufacturing agenda.''</p>
        <p>Discord in Florida</p>
        <p>In all, 42 states elect judges at some level and more than 80 percent of all state appeals judges face election, according to the American Bar Association.</p>
        <p>Members of the top courts of many states outside the Northeast are elected. In the Northeast, most states, including New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, have appointive systems for the highest courts. Scholars say the elective systems for judicial selection have their roots in the populist movement that sought to expand the power of the electorate.</p>
        <p>The new brand of open political warfare over judicial selection is also being felt this year in states like Florida, where top appeals judges are appointed.</p>
        <p>This spring, Florida Republicans proposed measures that would have given Gov. Jeb Bush and his conservative allies increased control over the State Supreme Court and over selection panels that review candidates for appointment to intermediate appeals courts.</p>
        <p>In response, Democrats filed a tongue-in-cheek amendment that they said made clear the extent of the challenge to the independence of the judiciary. It declared that the Christian Coalition ought to simply be given the power to certify who would be eligible for judgeships.</p>
        <p>The Republican speaker designate of the Florida House, Tom Feeney, said in an interview that the Democrats' little joke showed how out of touch the liberal legislators were.</p>
        <p>''The last bastion of big-government liberalism in Florida is the State Supreme Court,'' Mr. Feeney said, explaining why what the Republicans call ''court reform'' is necessary. The Republican measures were not brought to a vote in this year's session, but are expected to be introduced again next year.</p>
        <p>Judicial Impartiality Falters</p>
        <p>In interviews in more than a dozen states, judges, lawyers, legislators, political professionals and experts on the judiciary said the image of impartiality in the courts is a casualty of the new judicial politics. Even while campaign contributions were growing in the 1980's and 1990's, some of them said, judges seemed able to remain somewhat aloof from the battle. In place of those old inhibitions, judges are finding themselves full participants in the same kind of ideological warfare that has affected other branches of government.</p>
        <p>In Texas, when the watchdog group Public Citizen filed a federal suit in April challenging as unconstitutional the state's system of judicial election because of the history of huge contributions for top judges, some newspapers editorialized that it was about time. ''Texans know that the state's system of choosing its court judges is a mess,'' The Austin American-Statesman said.</p>
        <p>In one of the Illinois primaries this spring, an incumbent Republican Supreme Court justice, S. Louis Rathje, was unseated by a challenger who paid for campaign fliers that were distributed by anti-abortion groups. They described the challenger, Robert R. Thomas, as ''the only endorsed pro-life candidate.''</p>
        <p>Justice Rathje said the tactic showed that politics had fully arrived in the courthouse. People will have to get used to appearing in front of judges who have already stated their views, he said.</p>
        <p>''Would you feel more or less comfortable,'' Justice Rathje asked, ''with a judge who has already told you how he is going to rule?''</p>
        <p>Judge Thomas, a former Chicago Bears football player who now sits on an appeals court, said in an interview that the pro-life declaration was simply a statement of his personal views. ''It has nothing to do with my even-handed participation in cases.''</p>
