        <p>The Trail Blazers' collapse complete, Scottie Pippen slowly walked toward the Lakers' bench, a towel wrapped around his neck and disappointment etched in his face. One by one, he congratulated the Los Angeles Lakers, moving from Ron Harper to Kobe Bryant to Shaquille O'Neal.</p>
        <p>''I just wished them good luck and told them to go win a championship,'' Pippen said.</p>
        <p>Game 7 of the Western Conference finals appeared to belong to Portland with one quarter left to play today. After Pippen drilled a 3-point shot to give the Trail Blazers a 71-55 lead late in the third quarter, the Lakers seemed doomed to wilt under their own expectations.</p>
        <p>But Portland managed only 13 points in the fourth quarter as the Lakers emerged with an 89-84 victory after a furious comeback led by O'Neal and Bryant.</p>
        <p>''We can't take that quarter back,'' Pippen said. ''It's tough to swallow. We tried to test them and push them to the limit, and they responded. We'll see if they're crowned champions.''</p>
        <p>The Trail Blazers' defense kept O'Neal in check for most of Game 7. Through three quarters, O'Neal, the National Basketball Association's most valuable player, had 9 points and 5 rebounds and exhibited as much of a presence as an extra at a casting call.</p>
        <p>In the fourth quarter, O'Neal came alive with 9 points on 3-of-3 shooting and 3 of 4 free throws. Bryant, who led the Lakers with 25 points and 11 rebounds, also scored 9 points in the quarter as the Lakers moved on to meet the Indiana Pacers for the N.B.A. championship.</p>
        <p>Offensively, Portland had spread the court and lured O'Neal away from the basket. That strategy gave Rasheed Wallace more room to work in the lane and he delivered 10 points in the momentum-swinging third quarter. Steve Smith kept the Lakers confused from the outside and hit 4 of 5 shots for 10 points in the quarter.</p>
        <p>But the Trail Blazers suddenly went cold and shot 22 percent in the fourth quarter, making only 5 of 23 shots.</p>
        <p>''We did a lot of things right for most of the night,'' Portland Coach Mike Dunleavy said. ''It came down to the fourth quarter, and the shots just didn't fall. They beat us. We had looks, we had opportunities. Our shots just didn't go in.''</p>
        <p>Defensively, the Trail Blazers banged and flew at O'Neal from all angles. In the end, they tired before he did.</p>
        <p>''Maybe they wore us down,'' Dunleavy said. ''Maybe some of our guys were tired. I don't know. That's a tough call.''</p>
        <p>The battle in the middle became a bump-and-grind ballet as the Trail Blazers tried to put O'Neal in foul trouble. They succeeded to some extent, as O'Neal was whistled for his third foul with 6 minutes 18 seconds left in the second quarter and the Lakers trailing by 35-25. At that point, he had yet to make a field goal and was spending more time making passes to teammates than looking for ways to crash the basket.</p>
        <p>That third foul seemed to awaken O'Neal like a slap in the face. He muscled inside for two quick baskets and finished the first half with 9 points on 2-of-4 shooting and 5 of 8 free throws.</p>
        <p>Still, the Lakers' star center had three fouls. Yet curiously, the Trail Blazers couldn't force O'Neal into severe foul trouble; he was whistled for only one foul in the second half. Portland also decided not to foul O'Neal intentionally in an effort to protect its lead and slow the Lakers' fourth-quarter momentum.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't like he was the guy hurting us, so there was no reason to foul Shaq,'' Dunleavy said. ''We felt we had the game in our hands and if we could execute, we could win the game. Kobe and their other guys hit some big shots.''</p>
        <p>Although the Trail Blazers led, 23-16, in the first quarter, they fell behind early in the war of attrition against O'Neal. He took only two shots, missing both, and made 2 of 4 free throws, but whoever tried to guard him set off a chorus of whistles.</p>
        <p>Arvydas Sabonis was called for two fouls and went to the bench with 3:37 to play in the quarter. Brian Grant fared worse, picking up two fouls in one minute and being replaced by Jermaine O'Neal with 2:37 left.</p>
        <p>By the fourth quarter, O'Neal and Bryant took over, and the Lakers  prevailed.</p>
