        <p>I.B.M. in Venture With Salesforce  I.B.M. and Salesforce.com, which offers software for managing sales data like contacts, leads and follow-ups, as a subscription service from its Web site, plan to announce a partnership intended to help small businesses transform themselves into e-businesses.

        <p>Technology Deals That Went Wrong  In no sector of the technology business have more companies with less revenue been acquired for richer sums than in communications equipment.

        <p>Online Integration, Except for Taxes  Many traditional retailers have vowed that by integrating their Web operations into their physical stores, they will eventually bury Internet-only merchants. But even as these companies preach the gospel of Internet integration to the public, some of the best-known merchants are telling government regulators that their Internet and physical-world operations are distinct and separate businesses -- and therefore should enjoy the tax advantages of maintaining separate operations.

        <p>Small Booksellers Take Fight to Web  Independent booksellers, which have fought a two-decades war against chains and, more recently, online booksellers, are seeking to gain ground on the Internet with two large-scale Web sites. On June 6, the American Booksellers Association will introduce Booksense.com, a ''hub site'' for hundreds of individual sites created and maintained by local stores. Next to come, in early July, is Contentville, in which about 40 of the most respected booksellers will provide editorial content. ''Booksense.com and Contentville can all act to remind consumers that independent booksellers have a valuable voice,'' said Roxanne Coady of R. J. Julia Books in Madison, Conn., who is participating in both sites. [C11.]</p>
