        <p>It was a day for proving points while winning them at the French Open.</p>
        <p>Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario made it clear that despite all the red clay that has passed under her quick feet, she is still not to be taken lightly. Venus Williams, Monica Seles and Chanda Rubin showed that despite injuries and occasional bouts of self-doubt, they still belong in the second week of a Grand Slam event. And Yevgeny Kafelnikov, despite a visit from the trainer, proved that foot blisters do not always result in an upset.</p>
        <p>''It's normal, normal circumstances for the professional tennis player when you have blisters on your feet, and it's a matter of treatment I think,'' the fourth-seeded Kafelnikov said.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Andre Agassi faded meekly after developing the same condition against Karol Kucera in the second round. But today, Kafelnikov kept plugging and sliding away in the fourth round, coming within two points of defeat before finding a way to overcome Fernando Vicente, 5-7, 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (4), 8-6.</p>
        <p>The day's finest comeback, however, belonged to Sanchez-Vicario, the indefatigable Spanish veteran who trailed the Austrian baseliner Barbara Schett by 0-6, 1-4 before rallying for a 0-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory and reaching the 13th French Open quarterfinal of her career. She has won the title here three times and, despite the fact that a few French fans earned her wrath last week for booing her for drop-shotting so often, this remains her favorite event.</p>
        <p>''I'm still a very competitive woman; I still know that you have to play much better than me to beat me,'' the 28-year-old Sanchez-Vicario said.</p>
        <p>For her efforts, she earned a date in Tuesday's quarterfinals with Williams, who flirted with trouble late in the opening set against Anke Huber before taking firm control and winning, 7-6 (4), 6-2.</p>
        <p>''I'm feeling 80 percent now, and before I was about 50 percent,'' said Williams, who missed the first four months of the season because of tendinitis in both wrists. ''I'm still making too many errors for my taste, still inconsistent, but it's better every time.''</p>
        <p>The other women's quarterfinals, also to be played on Tuesday, will match top-seeded Martina Hingis against Rubin; the third-seeded Seles against No. 6 Mary Pierce, and the No. 5 Conchita Martinez against Marta Marrero, a fellow Spaniard.</p>
        <p>Hingis shook off a disastrous second set to defeat Ruxandra Dragomir, 6-3, 0-6, 6-1. Rubin, a Louisianian who was ranked in the top 10 in 1996 before a serious hand injury slowed her progress, defeated Natasha Zvereva, 6-4, 7-5. Seles, suffering from sinus problems and bronchitis but not from a lack of power or confidence, defeated Amelie Mauresmo of France 7-5, 6-3.</p>
        <p>Pierce overwhelmed Asa Carlsson, 6-4, 6-0. Martinez beat Ai Sugiyama, 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, and Marrero, a 17-year-old qualifier playing in her first Grand Slam event, beat Rossana De los Rios, 4-6, 6-0, 6-4.</p>
        <p>There was a time when qualifiers had little impact in the women's game, but the depth and suspense is clearly increasing. A year ago, Barbara Schwartz became the first women's qualifier to reach the quarterfinals here. At last year's Wimbledon, a record three qualifiers reached the fourth round. The 108th-ranked Marrero and 151st-ranked De los Rios reached the fourth round here this year. But while De los Rios walked off the court an exhausted loser, she could also be proud. In 1994, the Paraguayan took a five-year break from the game to get married and have a child.</p>
        <p>''I decided to play tennis again because one fine morning, I woke up feeling like I wanted to do it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Fortune has not often been Seles's friend in recent years. But she arrived at this French Open in a fine frame of mind and in good shape. She needed to be against Mauresmo's probing ground strokes. And although Seles double-faulted on her first match point, she got the benefit of a net cord on her second.</p>
        <p>''Really for me today the main thing was just to stay mentally strong out there because I had to fight so many things,'' Seles said of facing the popular Mauresmo. ''It wasn't just like a regular tennis match.''</p>
        <p>The crowd may not be quite so partisan when she faces Pierce, who represents France but now spends most of her time in the United States. Pierce beat Seles, 6-1, 6-1, on her way to the title at Hilton Head, S.C., in April.</p>
        <p>''We'll just see if I can rise up to the occasion; it's going to be up to me,'' said Seles, who missed five months of action and this year's Australian Open because of a stress fracture in her foot.</p>
        <p>A tiny stress fracture in Rubin's right hand changed the course of her career. In 1996, she reached the semifinals of the Australian Open and, at 21, was considered the next great American player. But she played little the rest of the year while doctors tried to diagnose her problem. She had not been back in the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam event again until now.</p>
        <p>''She knows fear now,'' said her coach, Benny Sims. ''From age 12 to 21, she didn't know any.''</p>
        <p>Spaniards generally have little difficulty with their footing on clay. Along with the three women who reached the quarterfinals today, two Spanish men, Alex Corretja and Juan Carlos Ferrero, also made it to the final eight. Corretja, seeded No. 10, defeated the Swiss teenager Roger Federer in straight sets. Ferrero, seeded 16th in his first French Open, eliminated Mark Philippoussis, 6-2, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3.</p>
        <p>The two Davis Cup teammates, who will face the United States on clay in the semifinal in Santander, Spain, in July, will face each other next.</p>
        <p>Kafelnikov will face No. 5 Gustavo Kuerten, who defeated 11th-seeded Nicolas Lapentti, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (4).</p>
