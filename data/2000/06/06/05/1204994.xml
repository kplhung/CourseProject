        <p>Hoping to catch the wireless Internet wave, Charles Schwab, the leading discount brokerage firm, plans to let its online customers cut the cord and do their online trading from cars, commuter trains or even the beach, using wireless devices.</p>
        <p>The move, which Schwab plans to announce today, comes more than a year and a half after one of its main competitors, Fidelity Investments, introduced wireless access. But so far, wireless brokerage services have remained such a small market niche that Schwab does not consider itself late to the game.</p>
        <p>''We're not the first, but we're early,'' said Dawn Lepore, Schwab's chief information officer. ''This is a marathon, and it's just beginning.''</p>
        <p>Schwab plans to introduce a service called PocketBroker that will enable its customers to maintain constant contact with their brokerage accounts while they are away from their homes or offices. Through two models of hand-held digital organizers made by Palm Inc., and eventually through pagers and mobile phones that can connect with the Internet, customers will be able to make trades and receive messages from Schwab about stocks they track and trades they have ordered.</p>
        <p>Schwab, based in San Francisco, burnished its image as a pacesetter in the brokerage business in the last four years, when it encouraged most of its customers to switch to trading online at a time investors were largely conducting business over the phone or in person. But many competitors beat Schwab to market with wireless trading services -- most notably the brokerage arm of Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based mutual funds giant, which began offering such a feature in October 1998.</p>
        <p>Yet, while Fidelity has aggressively promoted wireless trading and is the undisputed leader in wireless brokerage services, those activities still account for only a sliver of the company's brokerage business. More than 65,000 Fidelity customers have signed up for wireless access to their accounts, but that is less than 2 percent of Fidelity's brokerage customers.</p>
        <p>Joseph Ferra, who heads Fidelity's wireless operations, said the Fidelity Web site was visited four million times by Palm VII users in May. But only a tiny part of that activity involved stock trades, for which Fidelity collects commissions of $15 or more.</p>
        <p>Analysts see those figures as evidence that, until now, the demand for stock quotes, news and information about the financial markets has overshadowed demand for trading stocks using a wireless device.</p>
        <p>In recent months, however, a confluence of activity by wireless equipment and network companies, Internet service providers and publishers of news and information have given momentum to various sorts of wireless Internet applications. And so the online brokerage industry is stepping up its efforts. Besides Fidelity, an FMR Corporation unit, the online brokerage services TD Waterhouse, E*Trade, Ameritrade and DLJdirect have been busy linking up with Palm, pager makers and mobile phone service providers. AT&amp;T Wireless, for example, is promoting the ties between its new PocketNet wireless Internet service and Waterhouse, E*Trade and DLJdirect. Wireless access to Fidelity and Ameritrade is a featured service of the Sprint PCS Wireless Web.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferra, the Fidelity executive, said that locking up those relationships now, as the service providers promoted their offerings, would be critical to success as wireless catches on with user. Fidelity, for instance, has nailed down a potentially valuable deal with Palm, which loads wireless connection software on every one of its Palm VII's, that company's only model so far with a built-in wireless modem.</p>
        <p>When Fidelity introduced wireless access, Mr. Ferra said, it expected only the most active traders to want it, and so it offered the wireless service only to those with account balances of at least $100,000. Now, anyone with a Fidelity brokerage account can register a wireless device. Fidelity also provides delayed stock quotes and other data free to users of certain wireless devices and services who are not Fidelity customers.</p>
        <p>''The firms who get out here early and create a superior product will win this space,'' said Mr. Ferra, who calls wireless the ''second coming of the Internet.'' He said that about 70 percent of participants in a recent focus group indicated that they might switch brokers if their current broker did not provide wireless access soon.</p>
        <p>The brokerage houses have been waging an expensive fight for bigger shares of the fast-growing market for online investing. If wireless access will get customers to open accounts and move assets, firms will gladly offer it -- in the same way that traditional Wall Street firms like Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter came around last year and began offering low-commission online trading. Morgan Stanley introduced wireless access to online accounts earlier this year, and Merrill has said it will follow suit before the end of the year.</p>
        <p>By then, E*Trade hopes to have made its brand synonymous with mobile trading, said Jim Safka, general manager of E*Trade's wireless effort. The company, based in Palo Alto, Calif., wants to strike deals as quickly as it can with all of the major device makers and service providers and plans to use a big marketing budget to heavily promote wireless, starting in the fall, Mr. Safka said.</p>
        <p>''We're not focusing so much on it being a pure trading device,'' he continued. Whether an investor has a use or a need for wireless access to his brokerage firm, Mr. Safka said, ''has more to do with someone's lifestyle than it does with their trading behavior.''</p>
        <p>E*Trade's three million customers make, on average, two trades a month, Mr. Safka said. But he predicted that within four years E*Trade customers would increasingly be making connections using wireless devices rather than stationary personal computers. ''This market is going to take off like wildfire in the next 6 to 12 months,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Safka, Ms. Lepore of Schwab contends that no brokerage company has yet gained a lasting competitive edge, because the market for wireless financial services is only now developing in the United States.</p>
        <p>''The brokerage business isn't on wireless yet,'' Ms. Lepore said. ''I don't think in five years we will look back and say that in May 2000 the die was already cast. Wireless will really take off when more of the products are phone-based.''</p>
        <p>For now, Schwab's PocketBroker service will not be accessible through mobile phones. At first, it will be available for $55 a month to users of two devices, the Palm IIIx and Palm Vx, to which modems must be added for use with wireless services. But Schwab said it planned soon to extend the service to two-way pagers made by Research in Motion and later to mobile phones.</p>
        <p>Compared with this country, the more immediate business opportunity through mobile phones is in Europe and Asia, Ms. Lepore said. Through an alliance with the Swedish cellular phone giant Ericsson, Schwab is developing mobile Internet applications for use in Britain, Japan and Hong Kong -- areas in which wireless phones are already in wide use as portable data terminals.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lepore said Schwab planned to introduce wireless brokerage service for mobile phones this fall in Hong Kong, where many investors do all their stock trading through wireless connections.</p>
        <p>''This truly is a global play,'' Ms. Lepore said. ''And right now, it's very, very early in the game.''</p>
