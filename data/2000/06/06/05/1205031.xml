        <p>Hours before he flew to Moscow on Friday, President Clinton pointedly observed in a speech in Berlin that Westerners ''do not yet know if Russia's hard-won democratic freedoms will endure.'' Today, with a few muted gestures, the White House illustrated what he meant.</p>
        <p>This morning, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright visited Radio Liberty, the United States-financed broadcaster whose blunt coverage of the war in Chechnya last winter led to the Russians' detention of a top reporter, Andrei Babitsky.</p>
        <p>And this evening, Mr. Clinton gave an exclusive hourlong interview to Echo Moskvy radio, an all-news station that is part of Russia's Media-MOST empire. Long known for critical reports on the Kremlin, Media-MOST was raided last month by armed federal tax police, curiously clad in camouflage and ski masks.</p>
        <p>Despite the Kremlin's denials, the raid was widely seen here as a warning to Media-MOST -- and, for that matter, anyone else -- that opponents criticize this government at their peril.</p>
        <p>The two appearances underscored the sub-theme -- to the White House, at least -- of this arms-control meeting: the shaky state of democratic freedoms won after the Soviet Union's 1991 collapse.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton raised those concerns today in meetings with President Vladimir V.  Putin. Mr. Putin was said to have reassured the president that building a civil and democratic society was one of his priorities.</p>
        <p>But some political experts here, both Russian and foreign, are less sanguine. Mr. Putin's rise to power has brought an increasingly open effort to bring the press, religious leaders and other potential opponents to heel. That view was highlighted in recent confrontations involving government authorities that left the distinct odor, if not the reality, of a Kremlin crackdown on civil rights.</p>
        <p>In one case, customs officers searched the bags of an Amnesty International employee arriving in Moscow and confiscated  pamphlets alleging human-rights violations by Russian troops in Chechnya.</p>
        <p>In another case, potentially more serious, leaders of Russia's Jewish minority charged Thursday that the Kremlin was plotting to undermine and divide them, apparently to dilute complaints about Russian assistance to Iranian military programs. By those accounts, a Kremlin official pressured Russia's chief rabbi, Adolf Shayevich, to resign last week in favor of a Jewish leader who enjoys government support. Rabbi Shayevich refused and wrote a letter of complaint to Mr. Putin.</p>
        <p>International Jewish groups condemned  the Kremlin overture.</p>
        <p>The chief Moscow rabbi, Pinchus Goldschmidt, quoted American officials tonight as saying that Mr. Clinton had raised the incident with Mr. Putin and received a positive response. ''I can only hope that his response will be not only in words, but in deeds,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's paper commitment to civil and human rights is impeccable. In his guiding statement of principles, he wrote that ''the main threat to human rights and freedoms, to democracy as such, emanates from the executive authority.''</p>
        <p>But in the early going, Mr. Putin's passion for the strong center he says Russians need seems to have trumped other concerns. He has seeded the top ranks of his administration with former military and K.G.B. officials. And some of his farthest-reaching policies, such as a plan to tighten the Kremlin's grip on Russia's 89 regions, have come from strategists on his military-oriented security council.</p>
        <p>''Until President Yeltsin's resignation'' -- the deft move that virtually assured Mr. Putin's election victory last March -- ''it was almost evident that Putin was playing a role written by someone else,'' Nikolai Petrov, a senior analyst with the Moscow Center of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in a recent interview. ''When he replaced this team of former Yeltsin advisers with former K.G.B. guys, he looked more or less independent. But I'm not sure he still is.''</p>
        <p>By far the most visible suggestion of a Kremlin clampdown centers on the news media, which exist under the watchful eye of their own government ministry, beefed up by Mr. Putin last year. Since then, the ministry has pulled the license of one television station and threatened to auction the licenses of two others. One, Moscow's TV Center, is controlled by Yuri M. Luzhkov, a Kremlin rival and the mayor of Moscow. The other is ORT, a state-owned, avidly pro-Putin network controlled by the financier Boris A. Berezovsky. The two were accused of slanting election coverage.</p>
        <p>To no one's surprise, ORT easily recaptured its license in a one-sided auction last month. Mr. Luzhkov's TV Center, on the other hand, appears to face at least one serious bidder. It is fighting its license revocation in court.</p>
        <p>The ministry also has demanded that the news media ban interviews with or other quotations from Chechen guerrillas or opposition leaders.</p>
        <p>''Terrorists are waging a media war''  against the government, said Vladimir V. Grigoriyev, the deputy press minister. ''We are insisting that electronic and printed media not give a chance to the terrorists to address and lie to the nation.''</p>
        <p>Asked how a newspaper might be punished for violating the ban, he replied: ''That's the main problem. The mass media is probably the most democratic institution. There could be no real penalty -- probably a reprimand.''</p>
        <p>Federal law provides, however, that a newspaper can be shut down by court order after two government reprimands. And the case of the most rebellious and powerful of the Kremlin's press critics -- the Media-MOST empire run by Vladimir V. Gusinsky -- suggests that a powerful journalistic critic of the Kremlin risks an unusual run of bad luck.</p>
        <p>The company runs not just Echo Moskvy, but the daily newspaper Sevodnya, the weekly newsmagazine Itogi and the NTV television network -- the only network with a reach even approaching the coast-to-coast coverage of state-owned ORT. When his empire began attacking the war in Chechnya and refused to endorse Mr. Putin, Mr. Gusinsky said recently, retribution was swift.</p>
        <p>This spring, the government-controlled gas monopoly Gazprom decided to call due a $211 million loan to the company. The Media-MOST headquarters were raided last month in what the Kremlin says was an inquiry by the police into illegal surveillance.</p>
        <p>Days later, the Central Bank stepped in to prevent the sale of the insolvent MOST Bank, once controlled by Mr. Gusinsky. He charges that the action was taken to prevent Media-MOST from profiting from the exchange.</p>
        <p>In his radio interview tonight, Mr. Clinton was asked by a Russian journalist whether he ever had an urge to throttle a reporter or to sic his tax police on an unruly critic.</p>
        <p>''I think it's fair to say that in the history of our country, nobody has had more negative press coverage than myself,'' he said. ''But if the approach is balanced, then you have a chance to give an answer.''</p>
        <p>As for wielding the police against his enemies, Mr. Clinton said: ''I have never done anything like that. It's illegal.''</p>
