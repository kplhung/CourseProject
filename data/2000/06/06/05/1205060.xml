        <p>China's second telephone carrier, China Unicom, has confirmed that it has abandoned plans to use current wireless telephone standards known as CDMA developed by Qualcomm Incorporated of the United States.</p>
        <p>China Unicom, which is preparing to list its shares in Hong Kong soon, said it still planned to build a network using later-generation CDMA technology, the official China Daily Business Weekly said on Sunday.

        <p>China's second telephone carrier, China Unicom, has confirmed that it has abandoned plans to use current wireless telephone standards known as CDMA developed by Qualcomm Incorporated of the United States.</p>
        <p>China Unicom, which is preparing to list its shares in Hong Kong soon, said it still planned to build a network using later-generation CDMA technology, the official China Daily Business Weekly said on Sunday. But it said it cannot risk investing in current CDMA technology that may soon be obsolete.</p>
        <p>''The timing of construction of a narrow-band CDMA system has become unfavorable, so we plan to build a wide-band CDMA network,'' an unidentified China Unicom official told the newspaper. CDMA stands for code division multiple access, and Qualcomm's current CDMA technology is a narrow-band technology.</p>
        <p>The report is the latest in a wild ride for CDMA's fortunes in China and Qualcomm's fortunes back home. Talk that China would scrap its CDMA plans have plagued Qualcomm for more than a year. Last week China Unicom gave conflicting signals on its CDMA stance, hammering Qualcomm's share price.</p>
        <p>Qualcomm's stock is trading at less than half of its January high, largely because of the uncertainty.</p>
        <p>Given the size of China's potential market, the country's backing could cement CDMA as a technology standard for the future.</p>
        <p>China Unicom had been expected to build a CDMA network capable of serving 10 million subscribers by the end of this year. And the company signed a royalty agreement with Qualcomm in February. But telecommunications analysts have long argued that it made little sense for China to invest billions of dollars in a new standard when the country is already largely served by competing GSM technology and when technology standards are changing quickly in any case.</p>
        <p>China's support of the technology became a political issue during negotiations over the country's entry to the World Trade Organization. The United States lobbied heavily for China to open its markets to CDMA technology and CDMA proponents claimed China had agreed to back the technology last year.</p>
        <p>The newspaper report said the February agreement with Qualcomm ''could be canceled.'' Now Qualcomm can only hope to benefit from Unicom's use of CDMA technology in the future.</p>
