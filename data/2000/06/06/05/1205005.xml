        <p>In a noteworthy and unexpected warming of the coldest shoulder in the realm, Queen Elizabeth II this weekend met Camilla Parker Bowles, mistress to her son Charles, the Prince of Wales, for the first time since their affair began.</p>
        <p>The get-together was at a 60th birthday party Saturday for the exiled King Constantine of Greece at Charles's Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire. It ended an extended royal snub that had irritated and dismayed the prince and complicated choreographed efforts by his staff to gain gradual public acceptance of Mrs. Parker Bowles as his consort and possible queen.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Parker Bowles, who last saw the queen two decades ago, was reported by other diners to have made a low, formal curtsy. The two women then chatted briefly before the 100 guests tucked into a barbecue lunch. They were seated at different tables.</p>
        <p>For years the queen had let it be known that she disapproved of the liaison between the 51-year-old heir to the throne and the 52-year-old divorced woman whom Diana, Princess of Wales, blamed for wrecking her marriage to Charles. The prince's staff had made gaining the queen's tolerance of the relationship their No. 1 public relations priority.</p>
        <p>For royal watchers, birthday party attendance has become an important measure of whether the sovereign's thumb is up or down. Mrs. Parker Bowles was not invited to a grand party planned this summer for Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, who turns 100 on Aug. 4. In November 1998 the queen pointedly did not attend the Highgrove party marking Charles's 50th birthday because the hostess was Mrs. Parker Bowles. Next up for the guest list scrutinizers is the 18th birthday of Prince William next month.</p>
        <p>Buckingham Palace let it be known that the queen accepted the invitation for Saturday's party knowing full well who had been invited. A palace spokesman said Saturday night, ''The queen attended a birthday party for King Constantine given by the Prince of Wales at Highgrove this lunchtime, and Mrs. Parker Bowles was among the guests.''</p>
        <p>A constitutional expert, Lord St. John of Fawsley, said the meeting was a necessary healing of a long-running quarrel but did not mean that a marriage between the Prince and Mrs. Parker Bowles was likely. ''It is essentially a private meeting, but the queen is very well aware of the significance which will be attached to it,'' he told The Press Association, the domestic news agency.</p>
        <p>''The queen is cool in her judgment and she would have assessed the whole issue,'' said Lord St. John, whose name, following British tradition, is pronounced SIN jun. ''She has clearly concluded that the time has come for them to end what has been a point of contention.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''I welcome the fact that it has happened. There are so many problems which afflict families today that it is a very good thing that this potential rift between Her Majesty and the Prince of Wales has been healed.'' But he went on, ''It is a long step from that to concluding that a marriage will take place between Mrs. Parker Bowles and the prince -- but that is really a matter for them.''</p>
        <p>While there is plenty of evidence that Charles wants to step out in public with Mrs. Parker Bowles, there is little to suggest that he wants to walk her down the aisle. Members of his staff point to his statement at the time of his divorce that he would not remarry. They also assert that Mrs. Parker Bowles, to whom they refer  privately as ''Mrs. P.B.,'' has no interest in becoming queen.</p>
        <p>Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, said he believed that there would be a royal wedding and speculated that the Church of England would soon change its rules to allow remarriage for divorced men or women whose former spouses are still alive, the barrier blocking Mrs. Parker Bowles.</p>
        <p>There is little likelihood that she will be able to assume any official functions, but there may now be a place for her at private family occasions.</p>
        <p>Charles and the then-Camilla Shand first met at a London nightclub in 1972, where she is said to have told the prince that her great-grandmother was his great-great-grandfather's mistress, and then said, ''So how about it?'' She was referring to Alice Keppel, who had been the lover of King Edward VII.</p>
        <p>Their friendship bloomed into what he later described as a ''blissful, peaceful, and mutually happy relationship.'' Then he went to sea as a junior officer in the Royal Navy and she married Maj. Andrew Parker Bowles, a cavalry officer. During the 1980's, they resumed a sexual relationship, and Diana complained in a television interview that ''there were three of us in this marriage.''</p>
        <p>Plans for the public emergence of Charles and Camilla were well under way when Diana's death in a car crash in Paris in August 1997 put an end to any thought of it. The effort resumed on a night in January 1999, when photographers were alerted that Charles and Camilla would be emerging together from the Ritz Hotel after a 50th birthday party for her sister Annabel Elliott. The burst of flashbulbs turned Piccadilly into daylight during their 20-second passage from doorway to limousine.</p>
        <p>Details of Mrs. Parker Bowles's meetings with William and Harry, his younger brother, now 15, were leaked to improve her image among people who were unforgiving of her role during Charles's marriage to the boys' mother. The couple was filmed together on a Greek island cruise last summer, and she made a highly publicized trip to New York, where she was photographed with society figures.</p>
        <p>In the days in which she was accused of sinking the royal marriage, buns were thrown at her by angry shoppers in a food store and her looks were compared unfavorably with those of a horse on the front page of a newspaper. But opinion polls now indicate that most Britons are not opposed to the relationship, or even to their marriage, though there remains general opposition to the notion of her becoming queen. And now the most difficult convert has yielded.</p>
