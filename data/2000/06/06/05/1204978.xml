        <p>I.B.M. and the start-up company Salesforce.com plan to announce a partnership on Monday aimed at helping small businesses transform themselves into e-businesses.</p>
        <p>Salesforce.com, founded last year by Marc Benioff, a former senior vice president with the Oracle Corporation, offers software for managing sales information like contacts, leads and follow-ups, as a subscription service from its Web site.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, International Business Machines will make the Salesforce service available to customers of I.B.M.'s Small Business WebConnections, a monthly subscription service that provides shared Internet access for up to 100 users. I.B.M. and Salesforce also plan to jointly develop new applications, the companies said.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the deal with I.B.M. was a strong endorsement for Salesforce, particularly because I.B.M. already had a partnership with Siebel Systems, the leading supplier of traditional sales management software, commonly known as customer relationship management. Siebel has a Web offering called Sales.com that competes with Salesforce.</p>
        <p>Analysts said Salesforce benefited from a business model designed to be profitable with only a modest monthly fee, while Siebel's cost structure was based on traditional enterprise software pricing of thousands of dollars a user.</p>
        <p>The deal ''highlights one of the essential differences between an enterprise software company selling licenses and the software services model,'' said Vernon Keenan, an analyst with Keenan Vision, a San Francisco research firm. Software services, ''basically free the user from the need to hire and staff an I.T. department,'' said Mr. Keenan, referring to the information technology deparment. ''I.T. staff is a critical issue and Salesforce eliminates that.''</p>
        <p>For $99 a month, subscribers to I.B.M.'s Small Business WebConnections, get a local server computer -- the toaster-size Interjet from I.B.M.'s Whistle Communications unit -- 24-hour, seven-day-a-week technical support, and an Internet connection for up to 100 users. I.B.M. is offering two free months of WebConnections as part of the partnership agreement.</p>
        <p>On top of the WebConnections subscription, Salesforce users would pay nothing for the first five users, then $50 for each additional user.</p>
        <p>''Really we're on a mission to make every business an e-business,'' said Mike Braun, general manager of I.B.M. Global Small Business. ''Salesforce just has an outstanding application that is right in the sweet spot of the market.''</p>
        <p>Salesforce will be the first application offered for the WebConnections service. While small businesses have in the past made do with simple contact manager software for keeping track of sales information, Salesforce.com offers a program with the power of corporate applications like Siebel, but with a simple Web-browser interface that requires no user training.</p>
        <p>Even before the I.B.M. partnership, Salesforce said, it had signed 5,000 customers and was enrolling on average 200 new ones each day.</p>
        <p>''We believe we are now the fastest-growing C.R.M.,'' said Mr. Benioff, Salesforce's chairman, using industry shorthand for customer relationship management. ''For a lot of our customers, who are small businesses, we can move them into this modern age. I.B.M. will create a whole host of applications with a single sign-on, and an appliance to give them access to a full service network,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Braun said the deal did not reflect any weakening of I.B.M.'s relationship with Siebel. ''We have an excellent partnership with Siebel,'' he said. ''Siebel's offerings are really focused on the large enterprise. Marc's solution is really focused on the Web for small businesses.''</p>
