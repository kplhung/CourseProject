        <p>Yes, the plot is nutty. And yes, the music thumps along with absolutely no subtlety. But when American Ballet Theater presented ''Le Corsaire'' on Saturday afternoon at the Metropolitan Opera House, that swashbuckling 19th-century Russian story ballet kept a theaterful of children entranced and had the adult balletomanes among them cheering. And that is no small feat.</p>
        <p>The best way to see ''Le Corsaire,'' which Ballet Theater will perform again tonight and tomorrow night, is to go with the flow and not allow oneself to get lost in the crowds of fierce pirates and  nubile slave women and other local color at the Turkish bazaar and gardens and pirate cave where much of the action takes place. What is important about the production, based on versions by Marius Petipa and Konstantin Sergeyev and staged for Ballet Theater by Anna-Marie Holmes, is the opportunities it offers for unabashedly lovely and pyrotechnical dancing that for once grows out of and furthers the plot.</p>

        <p>The best way to see ''Le Corsaire,'' which Ballet Theater will perform again tonight and tomorrow night, is to go with the flow and not allow oneself to get lost in the crowds of fierce pirates and  nubile slave women and other local color at the Turkish bazaar and gardens and pirate cave where much of the action takes place. What is important about the production, based on versions by Marius Petipa and Konstantin Sergeyev and staged for Ballet Theater by Anna-Marie Holmes, is the opportunities it offers for unabashedly lovely and pyrotechnical dancing that for once grows out of and furthers the plot.</p>
        <p>Susan Jaffe and Jose Manuel Carreno epitomized the contrasting delicacy and prowling sensuality that make the ballet's most famous excerpt, the ''Corsair Pas de Deux,'' more than just ballet razzle-dazzle danced by two lead characters, Medora and the slave Ali.</p>
        <p>Marcelo Gomes's pirate Conrad, a role debut, was a man of simple passions communicated through easy, expansive classical dancing that contrasted enjoyably with the terrierlike intensity and whirligig travel of Joaquin De Luz, an endearingly villainous Birbanto. The clarity and amplitude of Maxim Belotserkovsky's dancing, a high point of the afternoon, made the slave dealer Lankendem unusually likable.</p>
        <p>Ekaterina Shelkanova, new as Gulnare, hovered between tragedy and mischief in an unsubtly danced performance. Ethan Brown was a charming Pasha, whose dream of an animated garden leads to one of the ballet's most exquisite sequences. That kind of beauty was also communicated in the dancing of Yan Chen, Michele Wiles and Anna Liceica in the Odalisque trio.</p>
        <p>The lead cast was completed by Eleena Melamed as the do-or-die head pirate woman and Carlos Molina as the Pasha's sweetly bumbling sidekick. Ermanno Florio conducted the score, a stew of music by Drigo, Delibes and three other composers.</p>
