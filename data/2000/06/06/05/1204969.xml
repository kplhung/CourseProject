        <p>The shakeout and consolidation that is sweeping Internet retailing has reached a related industry: Internet retailing trade shows.</p>
        <p>After a month of layoffs, closings and executive layoffs at Internet retailers, the publisher and show organizer, Faulkner &amp; Gray, has canceled its Internet Retailer World 2000 conference, which was scheduled later this month in Chicago.</p>
        <p>Kurt T. Peters, a group publisher at Faulkner &amp; Gray, said that Web trade shows were under the same pressures as Web retailers. More narrowly focused shows, like automobile e-commerce conferences, are now in favor, he said.</p>
        <p>''It's part of the normal shakeout and consolidation you see in any industry,'' Mr. Peters said. ''It's just happening faster on the Internet because everything happens faster on the Internet.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Peters said registration was still strong for another show, Electronic Commerce World 2000, which his firm was planning for October in Orlando, Fla.</p>
        <p>In another bad omen, the Internet Retailer World 2000 show had also planned to feature some companies that are now in deep trouble -- or out of business. ToySmart, the defunct Disney-backed toy Web retailer, had agreed to send its chief e-commerce officer, Mark Reese, to the show as a speaker. And executives from the struggling companies CDNow and Skymall.com, were among other officials who had originally agreed to speak.</p>
        <p>''I see it as another confirmation that there's a problem in the e-commerce segment,'' said Richard Smith, an Internet consultant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith knows this first-hand. In February, he agreed to speak at Internet Retailer World 2000 about balancing marketing needs with customer privacy. But in mid-May, he received a letter from the organizers  saying the show had been canceled because not enough people had signed up.</p>
