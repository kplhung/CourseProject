        <p>IN their quest for serenity and maturity, the Atlanta Braves do not permit music to be blared in their clubhouse. The Braves are one of the classy organizations in sports, and plan to remain so.</p>
        <p>''If there is a chemistry problem on this club, they've always been able to cut out the cancer,'' said Chipper Jones, choosing his words calmly and precisely.</p>
        <p>Yesterday afternoon, throughout this elite locker room, there was the silent scream of the Turner Field Men's Chorus, probably close to 24 inner voices shouting in unison: get this guy out of here!</p>
        <p>John Rocker probably blew his career in Atlanta yesterday in spectacularly oafish fashion. It is hard to imagine he will be on the Braves' roster when they travel to Shea Stadium for games from June 30 to July 2.</p>
        <p>Not only are the Braves sick of having to discuss his antics, they also see him as a threat to their safety. Kevin Millwood, hit by a flying object from some assassin-fan in Los Angeles, does not want to stand near Rocker anymore.</p>
        <p>''To tell you the truth, neither do I,'' Jones said.</p>
        <p>They give the impression they do not want to dress near him either. Yesterday, before playing their dominators from New York, the Braves had to deal with another outburst from the troubled man.</p>
        <p>Rocker, who got himself in trouble from a vicious stream of bile against gays, people with AIDS, welfare mothers, people who speak foreign languages in the United States, minorities and other urban types, spotted Jeff Pearlman, the reporter from Sports Illustrated who wrote the article quoting him.</p>
        <p>''This isn't over between us,'' Pearlman said Rocker said. ''Do you know what I could do to you?''</p>
        <p>Rocker then demanded that two stadium security agents not allow Pearlman into the clubhouse. The episode took no more than two minutes, nobody was hurt and the Braves said that Pearlman was allowed the same access as other reporters. But there was the stunning realization that Rocker has even less control of himself in person than on the mound -- 25 walks in 18 innings, including yesterday's shaky inning in the 7-6 loss to the Yankees.</p>
        <p>John Schuerholz, the Braves' executive vice president and general manager, released a statement that said, ''We immediately began to address the matter internally and are continuing to do so,'' adding, ''We will do everything in our power to insure that similar incidents do not occur in the future.''</p>
        <p>There is only one way to guarantee that. Tom Glavine, who has been here the longest, said he is not a psychiatrist, which tells a lot about what the players are thinking.</p>
        <p>Obviously, Major League Baseball accomplished nothing with the 15-game suspension to start the season. The commissioner's office merely told Rocker to stay away from work but never got through to his heart and soul. His parents, who are said to be good people, have not been able to calm his hair-trigger impulses.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Rocker gets plenty of support. What kind of a signal is it that management permits the display of the Georgia flag with the Confederate emblem directly in front of the Braves' dugout while the national anthem is being played?</p>
        <p>Many of the Yankees were stunned to see the vast majority of Braves fans roar when Rocker came running in from the bullpen.</p>
        <p>''He's home,'' said Brian Jordan, an African-American, a college man, a leader in the clubhouse, either meaning Rocker plays for the home team, or appeals to a nasty strain of Americans.</p>
        <p>Either way, Rocker does not seem to have many fans left in his own clubhouse. If the players thought this was some news media invention, they had the chance to scream at the press yesterday. Instead, they sighed when asked why the leaders have not warned Rocker to keep quiet.</p>
        <p>''That's been done already,'' Millwood said.</p>
        <p>Jones said the Braves -- ''white, black, Hispanic''-- had given Rocker a second chance.</p>
        <p>Alluding to his own history of domestic problems, Jones said, ''I've provided some distractions myself from time to time, and I'm not going to throw stones at John for saying things that may have been politically incorrect.''</p>
        <p>That view is reasonably pragmatic, but then Jones admitted: ''Yeah, it's a pain in the butt for 24 other guys. It's something we don't want to deal with.''</p>
        <p>Jones heard about Rocker's confrontation and said: ''He may feel he was misrepresented. The professional thing would have been to walk away. I haven't seen John do that yet.''</p>
        <p>One locker over, Jordan said: ''He's going to have to give this up sooner or later. The Braves will make do, with or without John Rocker. The general manager is too good. Bobby Cox is too good a manager. This is something John is going to have to deal with. I'm sure it will be soon.''</p>
        <p>''He's made his bed, now he's going to have to lie in it,'' Jordan said. ''Geez, you only get nine lives. He's using them up pretty good.''</p>
        <p>The Braves gave every impression they wanted John Rocker's life with the Braves to be over in less than four weeks -- before they go to New York.</p>
