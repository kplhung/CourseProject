        <p>Nearly 200 people were charged yesterday after the police raided a run-down movie house in the Bronx and broke up a professional cockfighting ring just as a night of gambling and bloody fighting was getting started, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Witnesses and the police said the raid, launched in near silence by scores of officers who surrounded the huge building and burst through two entrances with a battering ram, caught the gamblers entirely by surprise before the scene turned to bedlam and a chase ensued across the theater's roof.</p>
        <p>In all, the police said, 36 people suspected of organizing the spectacle were arrested. The event was held in a squalid auditorium and was attended by spectators who paid $25 admission to sit under low-hanging fluorescent lights while the birds sliced each other open and the men howled with glee or frustration over the outcomes of their bets.</p>
        <p>Those arrested were charged with one count of animal fighting, a felony under a state agriculture law. An additional 154 people were issued misdemeanor summonses for observing animal fights. The police said the investigation was still active and more charges might be filed.</p>
        <p>The theater, with street-level retail stores at 1000 Morris Avenue, was the scene of a similar raid in March 1995, when the police stopped what they said was a national championship cockfight. Nearly 300 people were arrested or ticketed that night.</p>
        <p>Deputy Inspector Michael Brooks, commanding officer of the Vice Enforcement Division, said the latest raid, which began late Saturday and continued into yesterday morning, was a bizarre episode, with roosters and men running through the building with police in pursuit. The floors were soiled with dog feces, blood and feathers. The odor was rank.</p>
        <p>''It was horrible,'' he said. ''The place was a real dump.''</p>
        <p>Within hours of the raid, fire marshals ordered the building closed, citing multiple fire code violations, including an absence of fire extinguishers, sprinklers and marked exits.</p>
        <p>Inspector Brooks said the police were still trying to determine who owned the building and who had promoted the cockfights that had returned to it. He said that one of the men charged with animal fighting, Corcino Martinez, 66, of 871 East 161st Street in the Bronx, had faced similar charges before and was believed to be among the ringleaders.</p>
        <p>''He's a career cockfighter,'' the inspector said.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, residents of Morrisania loitered outside the building, exchanging knowing winks and stories of bettors and wild-eyed birds.</p>
        <p>''Pollo, ha ha!'' a woman laughed, as she stepped from her car and pointed to a roll-up steel grate that covered an entrance.</p>
        <p>Residents said that for a while after the 1995 raid, the building was simply a mixed-use property with retail and service businesses. But they said cockfighting returned last year, just as meticulously organized as before.</p>
        <p>The fights were mostly on Friday and Saturday nights, they said. Sometimes, to sneak fighting cocks past storefronts, the rooster breeders arrived in a light-blue van. They would honk its horn and then be allowed in through a remotely operated sliding gate that opened onto a service entrance on Morris Avenue.</p>
        <p>On other occasions, residents said, men with roosters in black bags or boxes could be seen slinking from cars to a rear door, where a flight of rickety wooden stairs also leads to the cockfighting ring.</p>
        <p>Once the roosters were inside, the shows would begin. Bettors wagered $200 to $500 on the roosters of their fancy, neighbors said. Each fight lasted until one rooster collapsed and refused to fight on, a condition that often meant death. Then another pair was put in the ring.</p>
        <p>The police said they stopped the fights within an hour of the cockfight's beginning on Saturday night. Eight roosters were already dead.</p>
        <p>Inspector Brooks said the fighting pit, lined with green all-weather carpet, was about 75 feet in diameter and surrounded by two rows of chairs. A bar in the corner, which served mostly beer, kept emotions high.</p>
        <p>Residents said that when cockfights were scheduled the whole operation was guarded by lookouts who sat in cars and kept in touch by two-way radio. The streets were also watched over by video cameras, one of which was visible yesterday on the roof. Inspector Brooks said when cockfights were not taking place, the organizers allowed two pit bulls to roam free inside, guarding the place.</p>
        <p>Inspector Brooks said the police infiltrated the fights months ago when an undercover detective began attending fights to gather information on the bird handlers, guards and money collectors. The authorities said the detective's work enabled the police to pick out the organizers from the spectators after the raid.</p>
        <p>Witnesses said the raid happened so fast it seemed to catch the operation by surprise.</p>
        <p>''The police came up quietly,'' said Matthew Oscar, 31, who lives across the street and saw the action unfold. ''They didn't come up with the siren on or nothing. It was sneaky. All of a sudden, there were cops everywhere.''</p>
        <p>Inspector Brooks said the police surrounded the theater and used a battering ram to break through two doors. Then nearly 75 officers poured inside, chasing some of the cockfight enthusiasts to the roof, where the bettors tried to escape by scrambling down a ladder to a ledge.</p>
        <p>A police helicopter soon descended from overhead and used a spotlight to illuminate the men. One of the spectators jumped, landing on a ledge and breaking his ankle, Inspector Brooks said. The others were led by the police back down the service staircase with their hands in the air. It took more than four hours to catch and process every suspect.</p>
        <p>''With everything that was happening, it was pretty entertaining,'' said Mr. Oscar, who said he shrugged off sleeping and sat on his fire escape, smoking cigarettes and watching the show.</p>
        <p>Inspector Brooks said it was anything but entertaining inside.</p>
        <p>Officers with bullhorns were shouting instructions to the crowd in Spanish. Some of the birds escaped from their holding cages and were running free, including one that was outfitted with the razor-sharp metal spurs that the handlers equip the birds with before each fight. The smell was nauseating, the result of months of accumulation of blood, garbage and animal droppings.</p>
        <p>''Oh, it was bad,'' Inspector Brooks said.</p>
        <p>After getting control of the animals and the men, the vice officers confiscated $14,000, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police said 33 fighting cocks were taken from the auditorium alive. Cockfighting roosters, which are bred for ferocity, swiftness and stamina, are too evil-tempered to be adopted as pets and too tough to eat.  Many are also injected with steroids to make them meaner in a fight.</p>
        <p>The police said they took the birds to the Center for Animal Care and Control in East Harlem, where they would be humanely killed. The two pit bulls were also seized. Inspector Brooks said the dogs would probably be killed as well.</p>
