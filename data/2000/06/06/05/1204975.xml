        <p>Sandra Gibson has been named president and chief executive of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters, the largest association of arts professionals in North America.</p>
        <p>Announcing the appointment in Washington, Kenneth J. Foster, the association's chairman, said, ''After a national search which brought forward dozens of highly qualified candidates, Ms. Gibson was the clear top choice.'' Mr. Foster cited Ms. Gibson's ''vigorous leadership in several arenas, including Americans for the Arts, the Long Beach Arts Council and the American Film Institute,'' as factors in her selection.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gibson, 44, grew up in Ohio and studied music education and performance, earning a master's degree in musicology at Northwestern University. She was a doctoral student in ethnomusicology at U.C.L.A. and developed an arts program for the university's school of continuing education before deciding to forgo teaching in favor of arts administration.</p>
        <p>As president of the association, she will supervise its grant-making and continuing education programs and other activities. The association also holds an annual members' conference in New York and presents an annual Award of Merit for achievement in the performing arts. Last year's recipient was the choreographer Bill T. Jones.</p>
