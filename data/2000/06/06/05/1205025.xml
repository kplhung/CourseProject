        <p>After seven innings today, the Yankees' lead over the Braves was one run and Manager Joe Torre was absolutely determined to hold it, having seen the Yankees blow three leads on Saturday. There would be no middlemen, no finessing of the bullpen, no manipulation of matchups. Six outs remained and Torre summoned Mariano Rivera to get them all.</p>
        <p>''I wanted it very badly,'' Torre said later, cheerfully, after Rivera navigated through the final two innings, with difficulty, clinging to a 7-6 victory. Clay Bellinger gave the Yankees the lead with a pinch-hit home run in the top of the seventh in his first at-bat since May 27, giving the Yankees sole possession of first place when the Red Sox lost to the Phillies, 6-5.</p>
        <p>The Yankees (30-22) took two of three games from the team with the best record in baseball and left with the self-respect that had been stripped during Saturday's miserable defeat. Torre berated his players in a meeting right after that game, angry over their play.</p>
        <p>The timing of his rant might be construed as that of a venting manager, but some players thought Torre's outburst was more calculated than that. He singled out a handful of perceived offenders who occupy different sectors of the roster: Roger Clemens, a pitcher destined for the Hall of Fame; Jason Grimsley, a middle reliever; and Bernie Williams, the cleanup hitter, center fielder and highest-paid Yankee. If Clemens and Williams were being chastised, others perceived, then everybody has to be accountable, and Williams and Clemens seemed to understand what Torre was trying to accomplish. ''We're all family,'' Torre said today.</p>
        <p>What Torre was trying to convey, his extended family understood, was that they were not meeting their own standards; they were not playing to their own capabilities, having lost 14 of 23 games. ''We're better than that,'' Torre told his players.</p>
        <p>They responded with intense desperation today, Chuck Knoblauch forcing a 10-pitch walk to open the game and ignite a three-run burst, Tino Martinez driving in the last run with the first of his two doubles. The Yankees scored again in the third, the fourth and the fifth, though Paul O'Neill and Jorge Posada were out of the lineup.</p>
        <p>Andy Pettitte was also firmly pushing himself, Torre thought. But Pettitte's arm was not responding, and he could not command the flight of the ball. The Yankees led by 4-0 in the top of the third and Pettitte surrendered two runs in the bottom of the inning. The Yankees scored a run in the fourth; the Braves did, too. Scott Brosius slugged a homer in the top of the fifth, Atlanta matched that in the bottom of the fifth.</p>
        <p>Javy Lopez and Reggie Sanders bashed back-to-back homers in the bottom of the sixth inning, tying the game at 6-6. It felt like Saturday's Yankee loss all over again, the blown leads, the inability to contain the Atlanta offense. Torre felt his team had fought, battled. He wanted this game, badly.</p>
        <p>Bellinger batted for Pettitte with two outs in the seventh, just hoping to reach base.</p>
        <p>There was no reason to anticipate a home run; Bellinger rarely plays, and no Yankee had hit a pinch-hit homer since May 29, 1999.</p>
        <p>Terry Mulholland threw a fastball, a strike. He threw another fastball, same speed, same spot, and Bellinger slammed it, knowing on contact it would clear the left-field fence. He jogged around the bases, head down, stifling his smile until he reached the dugout, where teammates gave him high fives and hit him on the helmet.</p>
        <p>Grimsley pitched the bottom of the seventh, striking out Brian Jordan. Two innings remained. Torre turned to the pitching coach, Mel Stottlemyre. ''What about Mo for two?'' Torre asked, using Rivera's nickname. Stottlemyre smiled slightly when speaking. ''It's very tempting,'' he replied to Torre.</p>
        <p>What Stottlemyre did not say was no, and with that, Torre's decision was made. He wanted his closer, right then, one inning earlier than normal. ''We fought hard,'' Torre said. ''I didn't want it to slip away.''</p>
        <p>Rivera retired the first two batters in the eighth easily. Bobby Bonilla, a switch-hitter, batted for Walt Weiss -- right-handed, against the right-handed Rivera, figuring it would be easier to combat Rivera's cut fastball that way. He drove the ball to the right-field corner, and catcher Chris Turner and Torre and others thought it would land safely.</p>
        <p>But Shane Spencer motored in pursuit, extended his glove, caught the ball and took two more steps before bouncing off the fence. Rivera and others waited in front of the dugout to congratulate him.</p>
        <p>Rivera got two easy outs in the ninth. Then Andruw Jones singled. Rivera jammed Chipper Jones with a cutter, but Jones looped the ball over Brosius' head. Andruw Jones reached third and Chipper Jones stopped at first, ensuring that Rivera would have to pitch to the next hitter, Andres Galarraga.</p>
        <p>It was as if jeopardy yielded to adrenaline in Rivera's fastball: Turner could feel the velocity increase. Galarraga took a big swing, fouling the ball straight back; 96 miles an hour, the radar guns flashed. Another fastball, another foul, straight back; 97 m.p.h. Rivera threw a ball outside. Turner called for a four-seam fastball, a high fastball. Galarraga swung and missed the 97 m.p.h. pitch, and the Yankees spilled out of their dugout to congratulate their closer.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>DEREK JETER had three more hits and is 20 for 37 since returning from the disabled list. . . . CHUCK KNOBLAUCH, the second baseman, was replaced in the ninth inning after aggravating his sprained wrist. Knoblauch will take batting practice Monday in Montreal before deciding whether he can play. Catcher JORGE POSADA (bruised knee) could play Monday, while Manager JOE TORRE may give PAUL O'NEILL (lower leg strain) another day off. . . . The Yankees have the 28th pick in Monday's amateur draft, which scouts consider among the most confusing in recent memory, with no clear pecking order of selections. Baseball America, which analyzes the draft in depth, has speculated that the Yankees will take a catcher with their first pick -- either TONY RICHIE, from Bishop Kenny High School in Jacksonville, Fla., or California's MIKE TONIS.</p>
