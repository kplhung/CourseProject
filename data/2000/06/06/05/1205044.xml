        <p>SAY what you will about the shake-up in New York's Senate race -- and there is so much to say that we'll be reading about it in the history books -- Rudolph W. Giuliani's withdrawal has given the public a choice.</p>

        <p>SAY what you will about the shake-up in New York's Senate race -- and there is so much to say that we'll be reading about it in the history books -- Rudolph W. Giuliani's withdrawal has given the public a choice.</p>
        <p>We had one before, but on personality much more than on substance, because Hillary Rodham Clinton and the mayor agreed on most major issues. Not so Mrs. Clinton and Rick A. Lazio, Mr. Giuliani's successor as the Republican candidate. The first lady and the congressman from Long Island do share some of the same positions and give themselves similar labels: he calls himself ''mainstream'' and she calls herself a ''centrist.'' But you get the impression that these two candidates would often vote differently in the Senate.</p>
        <p>Why? Well, he is ''mainstream'' enough to get the support of the Conservative Party, which rejected Mr. Giuliani as too moderate. And Mrs. Clinton is ''centrist'' enough to win support from the Liberal Party, which is mainly in business to pursue patronage jobs, not an ideology. But this time the old label fits.</p>
        <p>Except for her support for the death penalty and lukewarm embrace of welfare reform, it is difficult to find an issue on which the first lady is not liberal -- which she cannot acknowledge because her opponents use the ''l'' word as a synonym for extremist.</p>
        <p>The Conservatives line up for patronage, too, but the Conservative Party also embraces a strong eponymous ideology, marked by opposition to abortion, to gay rights and to affirmative action.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio does not agree with the Conservatives on every issue, but if he wins it is logical for voters to at least expect the party to have access to him and a claim on loyalty, just as liberals would to Mrs. Clinton. And he does support the party's position on an issue of the greatest concern to the party and its leader Michael Long -- opposition to what critics of the procedure call partial-birth abortion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio supports both fundamental abortion rights and many curbs on abortion. For instance, he voted to ban Medicaid coverage for abortions, against abortions for women in federal prisons, against allowing military women to get privately financed abortions in military hospitals overseas, against human embryo research.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio strongly objects to so-called partial-birth abortions, often inaccurately described as dealing only with a rare, gruesome-sounding procedure used in late-term abortions. Critics want the procedure banned; supporters argue that Congressional legislation is so vaguely written that it could prohibit common procedures early in a pregnancy.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has no voting record, of course, but says she supports abortion rights without restrictions, and she won the endorsement of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. On the other issue where the two candidates differ most starkly, gun control, Mrs. Clinton backs comprehensive gun control measures, Mr. Lazio supports some regulations, but not others.</p>
        <p>He voted for the Brady Bill, which put a five-day waiting period on the purchase of guns, and for a ban on the sale of assault weapons. But he also has reservations about gun licensing and registration, which he calls ''speculative.''</p>
        <p>THIS is interesting because his Congressional district is in Suffolk County, which has some of the strongest registration and licensing regulations in the country. Suffolk requires anybody purchasing a handgun to register with the county Police Department or the sheriff, and to undergo an initial background check and another to renew every five years. County officials say that there are 30,900 licensed gun owners in Suffolk and that the regulations work well.</p>
        <p>Gun control advocates say that national registration would help cut down on gun trafficking -- critical to states like New York, where most crimes, including the recent massacre at Wendy's in Flushing, are committed with guns originally sold out of state. There seems little doubt that the issue will be coming before the next Congress.</p>
        <p>The legislative future of the abortion debate is more complicated, related to a pending Supreme Court decision on abortion, on who wins the presidency and who he might nominate to fill Supreme Court vacancies.</p>
        <p>Maybe -- in fact, probably -- New Yorkers will vote less on ideology than on intangibles, like temperament. But at least for the purists, Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton will be able to debate those positions on which they disagree. From the perspectives of mainstream centrists, that is.</p>
