        <p>One of the leading sources of mortgage loans for buyers of high-priced Manhattan co-op apartments dropped out of the business two weeks ago, and the ramifications are already starting to be felt in the city's mortgage industry.</p>
        <p>On June 7, Mellon Bank pulled the plug on new mortgages written through its subsidiary, the Boston Company. Since that date, said Ed Klotzbier, a spokesman for Mellon, the company's mortgage business throughout the country has been written through a new entity called Mellon Private Mortgage. The big difference: to get a mortgage now, a borrower must be a customer signed up with Mellon's asset management ($1 million in liquid assets required) or its private banking division ($1 million in net assets required).</p>
        <p>Melissa Cohn, president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, one of New York's largest mortgage brokerages, said that since Mellon's decision, ''We're seeing a number of banks step up to the plate to take over the Boston Company's niche.''  Ms. Cohn said the move would have particular impact on customers seeking mortgages of $400,000 to $1 million. She named First Republic and Fleet as two banks that have been actively campaigning for the new business.</p>
        <p>Janice DiMarino, managing director of lending for the New York office of First Republic, a San Francisco-based bank, said that the change was an opportunity for the bank, ''not only in New York but on the West Coast.'' Ms. DiMarino said the bank specialized in the ''super jumbo'' mortgage, over $650,000. Last year, it wrote $1.9 billion in mortgages nationally; the New York office, which opened only in October, did $54 million. (''But this year, we expect to write a lot more,'' she said.)</p>
        <p>While bankers said yesterday that the impact of the Mellon move was not yet fully understood, it seemed clear that it was getting more complex to take out a jumbo loan in today's banking marketplace. Ms. DiMarino said future mortgage-holders at First Republic would be pressured to establish the same kind of ''relationship'' that Mellon requires.</p>
        <p>She said that borrowers with substantial accounts at the bank would receive favored interest rates: anywhere from a tenth to a quarter of a point less on their loan.</p>
        <p>The Boston Company, which will continue its business in institutional asset management, wrote $1.9 billion in mortgages in 1998 and 1999 combined, Mr. Klotzbier said. Twenty-five percent of those loans were written for properties in New York, 30 percent in California, 25 percent in Boston, and the rest were scattered throughout the country.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cohn of Manhattan Mortgage said that last year her company wrote about $50 million in loans with the Boston Company, which was purchased by Mellon in 1993. Of the loans, she said, more than half were in the $400,000 to $1 million range.</p>
        <p>Both Ms. Cohn and Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Real Estate, a Manhattan-based brokerage, said they were informed of the change abruptly. ''One of my brokers heard from one of the loan officers they simply weren't able to do loans anymore,'' Mr. Peters said.</p>
        <p>Both Ms. Cohn and Mr. Peters agreed that the Boston Company would be missed. ''They were a player,'' Mr. Peters said.</p>
        <p>The Boston Company was one of New York City's major writers of the so-called negative pledge loans, which have been called ''the dirty little secret'' of Manhattan co-op financing. The negative pledge loans are basically mortgages written for strict co-op buildings with policies that prohibit such loans.</p>
        <p>As real estate and banking experts describe the practice, the would-be buyers who take out these loans keep them secret from the co-op board, which requires listing of all debts and financing details. This allows the buyers to free their own money, despite co-op rules for ''all-cash'' and ''half-cash'' purchases. Accountants, meanwhile, said the home buyers can and do deduct the payments as with any home mortgage.</p>
        <p>The Boston Company, said Mr. Peters, was ''the first big player with the negative pledge loans, and negative pledge loans became very significant in the last dozen years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Klotzbier of Mellon and Ms. DiMarino of First Republic said they would continue to offer the negative pledge loans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klotzbier insisted that Mellon was not ''jettisoning'' or ''divesting ourselves'' of the luxury mortgage business. He said that Mellon had not closed down Boston's mortgage business because of lack of business, as some in the industry have speculated. ''No, no, quite the contrary,'' he said. ''It's because Mellon wants to focus on wealth management: asset management and trust accounts. The mode we're in today, we want to invest in high-growth, high-return business.''</p>
        <p>And writing residential mortgages for clients who don't have the rest of their sizable wealth on deposit is not a high-growth, high-return business, he said.</p>
