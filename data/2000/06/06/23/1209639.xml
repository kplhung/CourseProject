        <p>A-ROD! A-Rod! A-Rod!</p>
        <p>This chant could be heard from the famous First Base Dugout a Cappella Choir during batting practice.</p>
        <p>Having been taught to take nothing for granted, a journalist ambled over to inquire, ''Say, just who is this A-Rod, anyway?''</p>
        <p>New Yorkers know when they are being twitted. The fans did not dignify the question with a response.</p>
        <p>''But you already have a shortstop,'' the journalist persisted.</p>
        <p>''He's broken,'' one fan said.</p>
        <p>''Time to move on,'' another fan said.</p>
        <p>Cold. Very cold. But realistic, nevertheless. Even before Rey Ordonez was injured, the Mets were already a logical candidate for the future services of Alex Rodriguez, known to all and sundry as A-Rod.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Mets did more than make do last night, as Melvin Mora hit a home run and made all the plays at shortstop as the Mets held off the Phillies, 5-4, with the fans' hopes for the future hanging in the muggy air.</p>
        <p>There are trade rumors all over town, what with the Yankees making feints toward Juan Gonzalez of Detroit and fakes toward Sammy Sosa of the Cubs.</p>
        <p>The Yankees probably cannot afford A-Rod, currently in the employ of the Seattle Mariners, but soon to become a free agent. He is a friend of Derek Jeter, but the two are not likely to wind up together on the left side of the Yankee infield. Meanwhile, the cold, cold hearts behind the first base dugout at Shea are on the case: A-Rod! A-Rod! A-Rod!</p>
        <p>Alex Rodriguez has, however, just become even more expensive because of the broken left ulna suffered by Rey Ordonez on May 30. The arm is not healing, and a plate and screws must be installed on Monday, which will keep him out for the rest of the season.</p>
        <p>Ordonez is currently in the first year of a four-year, $19 million contract. Rodriguez, who can actually hit, will come even higher.</p>
        <p>Before Ordonez was hurt, his batting average had regressed from .258 last year to .188 this year, but the Mets' players appreciate his fielding skill.</p>
        <p>''He is the best I've ever seen,'' said Todd Pratt, who started at catcher last night. ''I saw Ozzie Smith when I started in '92. Rey makes plays look ordinary that great for other shortstops. He's got great feet, great hands.''</p>
        <p>Pratt added: ''He's been struggling with the bat, but if he gets a little more confidence, he could be among the greatest shortstops. He's worth 15 or 20 wins a season. I don't know if you can say that about anybody else. I see it when I catch especially. He lowers the earned run average for every pitcher.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Ordonez, who may be several years older than his listed age of 27, does not come across as a student of the game. If he could bunt at all, the Mets might have won their uphill struggle against the Braves last October.</p>
        <p>Tiger Woods, who can keep a golf ball in the air by tapping it with his wedge, could probably bunt better than Ordonez. In fact, Woods has so much free time on his hands that he was out caddying for his college roommate in a tournament near Las Vegas on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Mets do not seem locked in to Mora and Kurt Abbott, and may even have been on the phone yesterday.</p>
        <p>''They've done an adequate job but we're not committed to anything,'' said Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager. ''We're continuing to evaluate the alternatives, to see if we could upgrade what we already have.''</p>
        <p>Mora looked like a regular last night.</p>
        <p>''I like playing short or second or center because I like control,'' the Venezuelan player said in very serviceable English. ''I am thinking I am a regular, but shortstop belongs to Rey Ordonez, and we just cover for him until he comes back. I'd like to be a regular but I love this team more than anything because of the way everybody treats me.''</p>
        <p>Mora brings positive energy to the field and the clubhouse. Everybody remembers his dashing presence in the Mets' fall charge. No matter what management says, it must remember that the Mets are close to futile with Ordonez batting eighth in a National League lineup, rarely getting fat pitches with the pitcher behind him.</p>
        <p>There are surely teams that would be thrilled to have Ordonez scooping up just about everything -- if his arm heals at a healthy angle, that is. Could the Mets live without him? It's a thought.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Melvin Mora leads off with power, and can handle shortstop, even with the chorus that chants, quite rightfully, A-Rod! A-Rod! A-Rod!</p>
