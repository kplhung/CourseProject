        <p>John Anderson reviews Julie Kent and Angel Corella leading American Ballet Theater in performance of Taming of the Shrew (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Katherina and Petruchio are the leads in John Cranko's ''Taming of the Shrew.'' But they're not the whole show, as American Ballet Theater demonstrated on Tuesday night at the Metropolitan Opera House. Julie Kent and Angel Corella were the leads, but several dancers had vivid debuts in supporting roles.</p>
        <p>Ekaterina Shelkanova played Bianca, the tempestuous Katherina's goody-goody sister. She looked sweet and pretty and danced very smoothly. But Ms. Shelkanova invested Bianca with touches of smugness as well as charm. One could also detect traces of smugness in Gennadi Saveliev's characterization of Lucentio, the handsome suitor who wins Bianca. These fashion plates deserved each other. And they were well matched in their pas de deux, which included an airborne solo by Mr. Saveliev.</p>

        <p>Cast as Bianca's other suitors, Sascha Radetsky made Hortensio a finicky fop, and Brian Reeder bumbled farcically as the foolish Gremio. Ethan Brown was the long-suffering and occasionally exasperated Baptista, father of Katherina and Bianca. Eleena Melamed and Marian Butler were unquenchably energetic as the Whores, who could dance and pick pockets with equal glee.</p>
        <p>David Briskin conducted.</p>
