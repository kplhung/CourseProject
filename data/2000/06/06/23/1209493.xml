Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on Page 8.</p>
        <p>Now Playing</p>
        <p>''BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE,'' starring Martin Lawrence. Directed by Raja Gosnell (PG-13, 97 minutes). This fitfully amusing film, starring the comic whirligig Mr. Lawrence, could best be described as ''Stakeout'' goes ghetto, with a touch of ''Tootsie'' for flava -- er, flavor. Mr. Lawrence plays Malcolm, an F.B.I. agent with a penchant for doing undercover work in full body makeup. Here he impersonates Big Momma, a stubborn old Southern woman. Why? Big Momma's granddaughter is on the run because her ex-boyfriend, Lester, a murderous bank robber, has escaped from prison. Malcolm believes he can use her to get to Lester. This isn't much of a movie; it looks like a series of baseball card shots and may have the worst rhythms ever in a film directed by a former editor (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''DINOSAUR,'' with the voices of D. B. Sweeney, Alfre Woodard and Ossie Davis. Directed by Ralph Zondag and Eric Leighton (PG, 90 minutes). Reputedly the most expensive animated feature ever made, Disney's showcase of computer animation technology begins with a breathtaking sequence, a visual and sonic extravaganza that the rest of the movie never quite lives up to. The story, of a young dinosaur raised by lemurs who must lead a herd of his fellow reptiles to safety after an asteroid strikes the earth, is cobbled from other Disney plots. But the effects -- the dinosaur's movements and their nearly seamless insertion into real locations -- will impress skeptical grown-ups. Despite some potentially upsetting scenes of carnivorous mayhem, the film will delight children (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>''FANTASIA/2000,'' with James Levine and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Various directors (G, 75 minutes). The millennial version of Disney's 1940 groundbreaking fusion of animation and classical music includes seven new segments and keeps one from the original film (the wonderful ''Sorcerer's Apprentice,'' starring Mickey Mouse). ''Fantasia/2000'' is more backward-looking than futuristic. The two best segments are ''Rhapsody in Blue,'' a witty Manhattan-in-the-Jazz-Age homage to the caricaturist Al Hirschfeld set to the music of Gershwin, and the finale (set to Stravinsky's ''Firebird'' Suite), in which a cometlike sprite whooshes around the globe explosively creating, destroying and renewing the planet's life forms. (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''FREQUENCY,'' starring Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel. Directed by Gregory Hoblit (PG-13, 100 minutes). ''Back to the Future'' meets ''Field of Dreams'' meets ''It's a Wonderful Life'' meets ''The Sixth Sense'' in this entertaining but shamelessly sentimental supernatural soap opera with a macho heart. Mr. Caviezel is a morose young policeman who makes contact with his dead father, a firefighter, on a ham radio and contrives to save him from the accident that cost him his life. The two collaborate on changing other aspects of the past and on catching a serial killer. There are enough testosterone tears to soak Shea Stadium (Holden).</p>
        <p>''GLADIATOR,'' starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott (R, 150 minutes). This movie is the answer to a question no one bothered to ask: what would happen if someone decided to film the imminent extreme football league as if it were a Chanel commercial? Mr. Scott subjects action-packed bouts of mayhem and decapitation in the Roman Colosseum to his glossy, inhuman directing style; it is admirable but repellent. As the noble Roman general who ends up fighting for his life, Mr. Crowe gives a performance with ball-of-fire intensity, suffused with a movie star's impatience. He holds the movie together, such as it is (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''GONE IN 60 SECONDS,'' starring Nicolas Cage, Giovanni Ribisi, Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall. Directed by Dominic Sena (PG-13, 119 minutes). A remake of a movie so insubstantial that its title seems to refer the length of time it would linger in memory. Mr. Cage, who has gone prematurely blond, is the world's best car thief, dragged out of his apparently lucrative go-cart business and returns to auto theft to save the life of his brother (Mr. Ribisi). With a magnetic cast of crooks and cops, it's mindless hot-rodding entertainment, a film so glossy and impersonal that you will sympathize more with the cars than the people (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''HAMLET,'' starring Ethan Hawke and Liev Schreiber. Directed by Michael Almereyda (R, 112 minutes). Mr. Almereyda has rooted his voluptuous and rewarding new adaptation of Shakespeare's play in today's Manhattan. The city's contradictions of beauty and squalor give the movie a sense of place, and New York becomes a complex character in this vital and sharply intelligent film. Often shaded in lush, soothing hues of blue, ''Hamlet'' exudes an intoxicating masochism in which half the cast is battling despondency and the other half has the glint of imminent insanity. Here the melancholy of Hamlet (Mr. Hawke) over the death of his father is almost a state of grace: it gives him a sense of purpose that the other characters lack. The director's rigorous trimming has a boldness and vivacity that make this version exhilarating while leaving Shakespeare's language and intent intact (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''HIGH FIDELITY,'' starring John Cusack, Jill Peterson, Iben Hjejle and Joan Cusack. Directed by Stephen Frears (R, 107 minutes). Although its setting has been moved from London to Chicago, the screen adaptation of Nick Hornby's best-selling 1995 novel is wonderfully true to the spirit of the book. Mr. Cusack has one of his juiciest roles in Rob, a 30-something record store manager and vinyl fanatic sorting through the ''Top 5'' breakups in his disastrous romantic history while trying to salvage his latest relationship. The movie hilariously captures the mind-set of not-so-young men for whom pop music is a kind of religion and hip musical taste an ultimate measure of a person's worth (Holden).</p>
        <p>''LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST,'' starring Kenneth Branagh, Nathan Lane, Matthew Lillard, Alessandro Nivola and Alicia Silverstone. Directed by Mr. Branagh (PG, 95 minutes). Mr. Branagh has decided, for no particular reason, to festoon an early Shakespeare comedy with classic show tunes and classic Technicolor movie-musical cinematography. His cast consists mainly of attractive young movie actors, most of whom are not terribly adept at singing, dancing or reciting Shakespeare. But the stumbling amateurism is not without charm. Mr. Branagh throws it all together with the gusto of a man playing a tuba with a bass drum strapped to his back while his pet monkey leaps around with a squeeze box. It's not art exactly, or even music, but it's occasionally entertaining (Scott).</p>
        <p>''M:I-2,'' starring Tom Cruise, Thandie Newton and Sir Anthony Hopkins. Directed by John Woo (PG-13, 120 minutes). Mr. Cruise returns as the daredevil secret agent Ethan Hunt in Mr. Woo's loud, flashy, incoherent new blockbuster. The film is jampacked with movie references -- to Hitchcock, to the first ''Mission: Impossible'' movie and to Mr. Woo's superior Hong Kong action films -- but it's at once overheated and flat. The plot, involving killer viruses, is baffling rather than twisty. The introduction of a love interest (Ms. Newton) who also happens to be the bad guy's ex-girlfriend adds an element of melodrama that's more grating than affecting. Some good car chases and explosions, though (Scott).</p>
        <p>''SHAFT,'' starring Samuel L. Jackson, Vanessa Williams, Jeffrey Wright, Christian Bale, Toni Collette, Richard Roundtree and Mekhi Phifer. The always dependable and indomitable Mr. Jackson stars as John Shaft, nephew of the seminal freelance crime fighter (Mr. Roundtree). A Manhattan police detective when introduced, Shaft leaves the force to bring to justice a wealthy, heartless WASP racist (Mr. Bale) who has beaten a black man (Mr. Phifer) to death. Aware that racial politics have changed since the 1971 original, the picture wants to trade on the not-so-subtle differences between stereotype and archetype, and breaks a sweat trying to shatter each. When ''Shaft'' scores at the box office, it will be a cheap, opportunistic victory, but an enjoyable one (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''SHANGHAI NOON,'' starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. Directed by Tom Dey (PG-13, 110 minutes). Mr. Chan is one of the great physical comedians, and this martial arts western spoof is a high-spirited, marvelously silly showcase for his talents. Mr. Chan plays Chon Wang, an Imperial Guard dispatched from Beijing to the Old West to rescue a princess played by Lucy Liu. But the heart of the movie is the interplay between Mr. Chan and Mr. Wilson, who depicts his inept outlaw sidekick with goofy, spacey charm. After the glum bullying of ''Gladiator'' and the noisy bombast of ''M:I-2,'' it's refreshing to see a movie so good-natured, so confident in its ability to provoke not queasy awe or numb exhaustion but pure delight (Scott).</p>
        <p>''SUNSHINE,'' starring Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Jennifer Ehle, Rosemary Harris and James Frian. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 180 minutes). In Mr. Szabo's tale of 20th-century Hungarian history, Mr. Fiennes plays three members of a wealthy Jewish Budapest family -- grandfather, father and son -- who endure the corruption of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the viciousness of fascism and the brutality of Communism. Mr. Fiennes's performances, and those of Ms. Ehle and Ms. Harris (playing the same character at different stages of life) help save the film from melodramatic excess. ''Sunshine'' is a serious, humane and thought-provoking attempt to make sense of complicated and painful historical experiences (Scott).</p>
        <p>''TITAN A.E.'' With the voices of Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore and Bill Pullman. Directed by Don Bluth and Gary Coleman (PG, 90 minutes). This animated sci-fi fantasy, set in the 31st century, imagines that Earth has been destroyed by aliens and what is left of  humanity is scattered about the universe in drifter colonies. Guided by a magic ring left to him by his father, Cale (Mr. Damon), a teenage space explorer, searches for the Titan, a hidden spaceship with the key to humanity's future. The technology is innovative, and there are some gorgeous special effects. But the screenplay and characters are too bland for the story to catch fire (Holden)</p>
        <p>''U-571,'' starring Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Jon Bon Jovi, David Keith and Harvey Keitel. Directed by Jonathan Mostow (PG-13, 120 minutes). Mr. Mostow, whose previous film, ''Breakdown,'' was a marvel of B-picture minimalism, shifts from the wide-open spaces to the cramped interior of a World War II submarine movie. Mr. McConaughey, whose knotted-with-unease face makes it look as if he were cramming for finals, is part of a secret mission to capture a Nazi code-encryption machine and get it back to the Allies. He and his crew have to do so on a Nazi U-boat they have hijacked. Mr. Mostow does a fine job of building tension, given that he is working in a minor genre whose climactic notes you will know if you have ever seen a movie set on a sub (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''THE VIRGIN SUICIDES,'' starring Kirsten Dunst, James Woods and Kathleen Turner. Directed by Sofia Coppola (R, 97 minutes). Ms. Coppola's directorial debut, adapted from Jeffrey Eugenides's 1993 novel about the self-destruction of five sisters in a 1970's Michigan suburb, shows her to be a filmmaker with fine visual and emotional instincts, adept at matching the book's hypnotic, sensual black humor. The movie's best moments have an inspired feeling of playfulness and freedom matched by Ms. Dunst's smart, beguiling performance as Lux Lisbon, whose sexual awakening propels her and her sisters to their doom. But despite Ms. Coppola's keen instincts, and the beautifully understated acting of Mr. Woods and Ms. Turner as the Lisbon parents, ''The Virgin Suicides'' is marred by the self-conscious aestheticism and emotional detachment of its source (Scott).</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>''A GIFT FROM MEDIASET: 10 ITALIAN FILM CLASSICS'' -- The riches of Italian cinema of the 1950's and 60's are on display at the Museum of Modern Art, where a new series is devoted to 10 films restored in a collaborative effort by the museum's department of film and video and Cinema Forever, a preservation program of the Italian communications and broadcasting company Mediaset Group.
