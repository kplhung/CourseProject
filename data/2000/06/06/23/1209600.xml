        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton eagerly toured the lair of her former opponent, Mayor Rudolph W.

        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton eagerly toured the lair of her former opponent, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, yesterday, and for the first time engaged in a New York City political institution, a news conference on the City Hall steps. But she assiduously avoided the mayor, who slipped into his office moments before she arrived and stayed put as she walked the hallways and visited with the Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone.</p>
        <p>''Have a good day!'' Mr. Giuliani said to reporters who asked how it felt to have his former opponent in the race for United States Senate park on his steps and create the biggest splash at City Hall since the mayor withdrew from the Senate race in his own media melee. Earlier in the day, at a news conference in Brooklyn, Mr. Giuliani had said that Mrs. Clinton ''has every right to have press conferences'' at City Hall and that ''actually, I'm surprised it hasn't happened up until now.''</p>
        <p>The agenda of Mrs. Clinton's steamy noon news conference was an attack on her new opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, for what she said was his sluggish response to a reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act now before Congress. Mrs. Clinton also asserted that Republicans had put the bill on ''the back burner.'' Although Mr. Lazio supported the act, which was part of the Clinton administration's crime bill in 1994, Mrs. Clinton took issue with him for not being one of some 200 co-sponsors of the bill this year.</p>
        <p>''If he supported it in '94, why hasn't he co-sponsored?'' Mrs. Clinton said in the middle of a throng of cameras, reporters, mayoral aides, City Council members and onlookers. ''He's co-sponsored more than 140 bills; why has this one escaped his notice? I think it's a very telling omission on his part.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's campaign spokesman, Dan McLagan, responded: ''One does not have to be a co-sponsor of a bill to support it. There is a big difference in the two candidates in this race. Rick Lazio worked for and voted for the Violence Against Women Act. He's actually done something. Mrs. Clinton's held press conferences.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's news conference took place before Robert W. Ray, the independent counsel investigating the first lady and President Clinton, said that Mrs. Clinton's involvement in the 1993 firing of seven longtime White House travel office employees was more extensive than she had acknowledged. But Mr. Ray said he would not prosecute her, concluding that the evidence was insufficient to show that she knowingly lied.</p>
        <p>Outside on the City Hall steps, where she was joined by C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, and City Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge, Mrs. Clinton called the recent sexual assaults on women in Central Park a ''disgrace'' and ''horrifying.'' But she refrained from joining critics who said that the New York City Police Department was lax in its response.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton also sidestepped a question about whether she thought the mayor had been too mild in his initial reaction to the attacks -- a striking contrast from two months ago, when she would have jumped at an invitation to criticize him.</p>
        <p>''You know, I'm going to keep focusing on what we're doing here today,'' she said. ''Which is to try to get this act in Congress reauthorized.''</p>
        <p>Asked if she would try to meet with Mr. Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton cheerily replied, ''I'm always up to, and open to, meeting with the mayor.''</p>
        <p>Then she left for a fund-raiser in Detroit.</p>
