        <p>Forty years of familiarity have not taken the strangeness out of ''Porgy and Bess'' and ''Sketches of Spain,'' two albums that Miles Davis made with arrangements by Gil Evans from 1958-60. The beauty of the concert versions presented by the JVC Jazz Festival on Sunday night at Carnegie Hall, with Maria Schneider conducting her orchestra and Jon Faddis as trumpet and fluegelhorn soloist, was that they illuminated details while leaving the mystery intact.</p>
        <p>On both albums, Evans arranged other composers' works to his own very different ends. ''Porgy and Bess'' (Columbia) transmuted Gershwin's rendition of loving, gambling and fighting in New Orleans into a subdued, faraway speculation on the power of yearning. ''Sketches of Spain'' (Columbia), using folk melodies and pieces by Joaquin Rodrigo and Manuel de Falla, placed Mr. Davis's trumpet in a mirage of Andalusia, awash in memories of flamenco songs and echoes of parades. The group also performed Evans's arrangement of Weill's ''My Ship'' from ''Miles Ahead,'' with Miles Evans, Gil's son, joining Mr. Faddis on trumpet.</p>

        <p>Forty years of familiarity have not taken the strangeness out of ''Porgy and Bess'' and ''Sketches of Spain,'' two albums that Miles Davis made with arrangements by Gil Evans from 1958-60. The beauty of the concert versions presented by the JVC Jazz Festival on Sunday night at Carnegie Hall, with Maria Schneider conducting her orchestra and Jon Faddis as trumpet and fluegelhorn soloist, was that they illuminated details while leaving the mystery intact.</p>
        <p>On both albums, Evans arranged other composers' works to his own very different ends. ''Porgy and Bess'' (Columbia) transmuted Gershwin's rendition of loving, gambling and fighting in New Orleans into a subdued, faraway speculation on the power of yearning. ''Sketches of Spain'' (Columbia), using folk melodies and pieces by Joaquin Rodrigo and Manuel de Falla, placed Mr. Davis's trumpet in a mirage of Andalusia, awash in memories of flamenco songs and echoes of parades. The group also performed Evans's arrangement of Weill's ''My Ship'' from ''Miles Ahead,'' with Miles Evans, Gil's son, joining Mr. Faddis on trumpet.</p>
        <p>Evans was a virtuoso of ambiguity, creating music as trackless as an ocean or a wilderness. On ''Porgy and Bess'' and ''Sketches of Spain,'' he replaced the crisp attacks of big-band horns with apparitions that wafted out of silence. Rhythm dissolved into an almost subliminal pulse or undulation; chords took on so many added notes that their identity grew blurred.</p>
        <p>Melodies became tentative, as if they might disappear at any moment into the haze of harmony. Even standard forms, like the blues tunes Gershwin wrote in ''Porgy and Bess,'' were destabilized with overlays of other harmonies, other rhythms.</p>
        <p>At times, the trumpet solo set off ripples of response in the band: a reflected aura of muted trumpets, or an isolated, swinging saxophone line that soon disappeared. More often, the trumpet wandered through lush abstractions. Davis's solos became the voice of a man lost in an unfamiliar landscape and trying to make his way to an unknown destination, suffused with the melancholy dignity of a hero adrift.</p>
        <p>Davis and Evans had performed the music at Carnegie Hall in 1961. Then the parts were thought to be lost, leaving musicians puzzling over exactly how Evans created his spectral combinations. But three years ago the scores reappeared in a warehouse, and Ms. Schneider, an Evans disciple, was the clear choice to lead a repertory performance of them. Mr. Faddis was a far less obvious candidate; his usual extroverted style, shouting the high notes, is a far cry from Davis's smoldering introspection.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Faddis reshaped his playing in Davis's image: not copying exact solos but capturing both Davis's nearly vibrato-free tone and his characteristic inflections. It was a concentrated, selfless performance, impressive for both its restraint and its quiet fervor.</p>
        <p>The recordings of ''Sketches of Spain'' and ''Porgy and Bess'' both had a gauzy sound, calibrated to the music's delicacy. Onstage, without the flexibility of a recording studio, Ms. Schneider did a remarkable job of maintaining the instrumental blend, even in Evans's combinations of extremely high and low sounds. Seeing the music performed opened up some of its secrets: the moment when rhythmic castanets turn into an atmospheric rattle in ''Concierto de Aranjuez,'' the low trills that obscure the roots of the chords in ''I Loves You, Porgy.''</p>
        <p>For the phantom processional of ''Saeta,'' Ms. Schneider placed the trumpets backstage, fading them in and out with an opening and closing door. Yet even with its mechanisms in plain view, the music's serene inscrutability was undisturbed.</p>
