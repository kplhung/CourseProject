        <p>Bound and Unbound  601 West 26th Street, Chelsea  Through June 30</p>
        <p>Charlotte Moorman (1933-1991) was famous as the ''topless cellist'' arrested for indecent exposure during a performance of Nam Jun Paik's ''Opera Sextronique'' in New York City in 1967. But her career amounted to very much more than a single sensational run-in with American morality.</p>
        <p>A pioneering performance artist, Moorman was an important collaborator with many vanguard figures from the United States, Europe and Asia. Juilliard-trained (she was a cellist in Leopold Stokowski's American Symphony Orchestra), she gave premiere presentations of work by John Cage, Morton Feldman and Karlheinz Stockhausen. To the composer Edgard Varese she was ''the Jeanne d'Arc of new music.''</p>
        <p>In 1963, she founded the Annual New York Avant-Garde Festival, an anarchic, multimedia gathering of artists, musicians, dancers and filmmakers, both famous and unknown. Festival sites ranged from the Staten Island ferry to Shea Stadium, and the event grew larger and wackier by the year. Moorman's own participation often entailed acts of physical derring-do: one piece found her playing the cello while suspended from balloons; another while submerged in a tank of water.</p>
        <p>Although the festival ran out of steam, it helped introduce unorthdox forms like performance and installation to the New York art world, as well as new electronic media that presaged the widespread use of computer technology today. And by the time Moorman died of cancer at age 57, her niche, modest but distinctive, in the history of postwar art was secure.</p>
        <p>The show at Bound and Unbound is drawn from the immense archive she left behind, which the gallery's director, Barbara Moore, an executor of the estate of Moorman's husband, has begun to sort out and selectively offer for sale. The first cut has yielded a fascinating cache of material, historical and personal: inscribed musical scores, posters from the festivals (most of them designed by Jim McWilliams, a long-time Moorman collaborator) and works made for Moorman by artists she knew, including a felt-covered cello with a disputed attribution to Joseph Beuys.</p>
        <p>Also on hand is a wealth of photographs and a winsome video about Ms. Moorman's career created by Mr. Paik and Howard Weinberg. It catches both the good-humored daring of her accomplishments and the evanescent spirit of an American vanguard moment whose history is just beginning to be sorted out in exhibitions like this one. A few institutions have apparently expressed interest in acquiring and preserving a representative chunk of Moorman's estate. (Bound and Unbound is selling, for the most part, work that exists in duplicate form.) One hopes somebody will move on this soon.</p>
