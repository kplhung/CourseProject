        <p>SUZZY ROCHE: -- ''Songs From an Unmarried Housewife and Mother, Greenwich Village, U.S.A.'' (Red House Records). Suzzy Roche still wears leg warmers -- colorful striped ones on the cover of her second album away from the Roches, the trio of singing sisters who have helped define modern-day female bohemianism for 20 years. The Roche sisters, like those leg warmers, are loudly and wittily themselves, unworried about the fashion value of their eccentricities. Suzzy, the youngest, fully finds her subject matter on this carefully produced selection of folksy songs.</p>

        <p>SUZZY ROCHE: -- ''Songs From an Unmarried Housewife and Mother, Greenwich Village, U.S.A.'' (Red House Records). Suzzy Roche still wears leg warmers -- colorful striped ones on the cover of her second album away from the Roches, the trio of singing sisters who have helped define modern-day female bohemianism for 20 years. The Roche sisters, like those leg warmers, are loudly and wittily themselves, unworried about the fashion value of their eccentricities. Suzzy, the youngest, fully finds her subject matter on this carefully produced selection of folksy songs.</p>
        <p>It's all about lumpy love: prickly middle-aged couples and never-quite-lovers, babies on roller coasters and too-young expectant moms on commuter trains. Ms. Roche's clean, conversational voice sounds just like a friend's on the phone, telling idle stories that turn out to be unforgettable. With her sister Maggie and daughter Lucy on harmonies, and help from her friends Loudon Wainwright 3d, Jules Shear, David Mansfield and Curtis Stigers, Ms. Roche is still a sister anyone would want but one with a stance all her own. Suzzy Roche and friends play the Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, at Mercer Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880, tomorrow at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m.; admission is $20.</p>
