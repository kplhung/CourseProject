        <p>Herbalife International was built on Mark Hughes's story.</p>
        <p>As a teenager who had spent time in a reform school, Mr. Hughes saw his mother die from an accidental overdose of prescription diet pills and set out to find a safer, better way to help people lose weight. At 23, with only a ninth-grade education and after stints with two direct-sales weight-loss companies that went out of business, he went out on his own.</p>
        <p>He found a formula and started selling. His grandmother was his first success, and her example brought in friends as new customers. ''Lose Weight Now, Ask Me How,'' became the mantra for Herbalife, which started in the trunk of Mr. Hughes's car in 1980. It found its footing in a small storefront in Beverly Hills, Calif., and grew into a weight-loss, nutrition and personal care products company with worldwide sales of nearly $1.7 billion last year.</p>
        <p>But on May 21, the Hughes story came to a tragic, almost ironic end when Mr. Hughes was found dead in the bedroom of the $25 million Malibu beachfront house that he shared with his third wife, Darcy LaPier. The company said he had drunk alcohol at a birthday party for his 87-year-old grandmother at his home and later took the antidepressant Doxepin, which had been prescribed to help him sleep. Officials ruled the death an accident, noting that neither the drugs nor the alcohol in his system would have been fatal alone. But the combination was lethal.</p>
        <p>The death of the handsome and charismatic Mr. Hughes at 44 is a serious blow for the company -- both because he was Herbalife's head cheerleader and because of the possibility that his message of a better life through herbal products might be diminished by the way he died.</p>
        <p>''It's obviously an image problem,'' said Scott Hood, portfolio manager at First Wilshire Securities Management, which has owned Herbalife shares since late 1989. ''But how bad is it? It's not like he was taking their own products.''</p>
        <p>Beyond image, though, a number of other issues face the executives who now run the company. A new team has taken up the challenge of motivating and expanding a vast network of distributors who buy the products from the company and in turn recruit new distributors. Other worries include a slumping domestic market for herbal products, a tight job market that could make it more difficult to draw in distributors, a damaged relationship with Wall Street after a failed attempt to take the company private, and stock transactions that left investors crying foul.</p>
        <p>Nearly 58 percent of the stock is now held in a trust. The trustees are Christopher Pair, formerly the chief operating officer of Herbalife and now the president and chief executive; Conrad Klein, the chief business affairs officer and a longtime legal adviser to the company; and Jack Reynolds, Mr. Hughes's father. (As a young man, Mr. Hughes took his mother's maiden name.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Pair, who was a counselor at the reform school that Mr. Hughes attended and later became a friend, said in an interview at company headquarters in Los Angeles that he had no intention of trying to substitute for Mr. Hughes, who at his death was chairman, president and chief executive of the company..</p>
        <p>''I could never fill his shoes,'' he said, adding with a chuckle, ''I don't have his looks.''</p>
        <p>That is not to say he does not have a story to share with distributors. When Mr. Pair was a young man, overweight and struggling with back problems, Mr. Hughes persuaded him to try his product, a weight-loss powder that was so new it came in plastic bags rather than cans.</p>
        <p>He said he dropped 50 pounds in four months and became a distributor for a short period before returning to the University of Redlands in California to get his business degree. Though he says his experience as a distributor will help him in managing the company, he intends to focus more on operations and on mending the relationship with Wall Street.</p>
        <p>To motivate distributors, he said, there are plenty of other stories to be told and thousands of hours of tapes of Mark Hughes selling his vision.</p>
        <p>On Herbalife's Web site (www.herbalife.com), the voice of Mr. Hughes still tells how his mother ''totally destroyed her life just trying to lose 30 pounds'' as the company promotes its vision of realizing monetary dreams through selling its vast array of products. Beyond its core weight-loss and nutritional supplements, it features a wide variety of skin care items, vitamins, shampoos, even a natural sleep product. Among the company's competitors are Amway, Nature's Sunshine and Weider Nutrition International.</p>
        <p>To keep Mr. Hughes's message fresh, Herbalife will rely more on the stories of its top sellers. Members of the Chairman's Club and the President's Team, who have networks bringing in hundreds of thousands of dollars a month, already train new distributors and conduct seminars, and those elite categories give distributors a goal to strive for.</p>
        <p>''Our success is just a reflection of his power,'' said Paco Perez, who was a bellboy at an airport hotel in Los Angeles before becoming Mr. Hughes's first employee and is now a member of the President's Team. ''He taught us all by example. We're committed to his dream.''</p>
        <p>To realize that dream, the network must keep growing. Despite setbacks, it has always done just that.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1980's, the company came under intense scrutiny by regulators. The company paid $850,000 to settle a lawsuit by the state of California that accused it of having made false medical claims and having run an illegal marketing scheme. The Food and Drug Administration forced it to remove two products from the market for relabeling.</p>
        <p>Business issues have been of more concern in recent years. Currency turmoil in Asia and Russia resulted in a steep drop in the stock price, and Wall Street developed concerns about how the company, which went public in 1986, was handling its stock and how it was preparing to go private again.</p>
        <p>Though officials say the product and marketing issues of the 1980's did not amount to much and of are no concern now, Mr. Pair said he would focus on rebuilding the company's relationship with Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Mike Crawford, an analyst with B. Riley &amp; Company, a Los Angeles brokerage house, said, ''There's one significant hurdle standing in the way of Herbalife regaining the trust of Wall Street, and that's showing management is there for shareholders and not for themselves.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Crawford, whose firm stopped covering Herbalife last year, noted that in 1998 management stock options with original strike prices of about $14 were reset between $6.63 and $8. Such a move is not uncommon when a company's stock price drops, as Herbalife's did then, but this adjustment would have meant large profits for executives had Mr. Hughes's buyback attempt gone through at $17.81 a share. That effort, which would have repurchased all the company's stock, was terminated because of bond market turmoil and increased interest rates.</p>
        <p>Also of concern was a complex transaction in 1998 in which Mr. Hughes ultimately received $18 a share for five million shares. Add to that the buyback attempt, which led to a lawsuit by shareholders who felt the offer was too low, and Mr. Pair has plenty to talk about.</p>
        <p>''While we've had some very valid issues internally,'' he said, referring to the legal fees and other costs of the buyback attempt, ''the company is extraordinarily sound, the distributor base is absolutely committed to building the business, and we've got a management team in place that is going to continue to do what Mark started.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pair said he would try to increase the price of the stock, which he says is greatly undervalued. It closed at $8 a share yesterday on Nasdaq, down from a 52-week high of $16.375 on Jan. 14.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pair declined to offer specifics before sharing them with shareholders in July, but he said plans call for continuing overseas expansion and adding new products and new technology to aid distributors.</p>
        <p>''There's over 130 countries in the world; we're in 49,'' Mr. Pair said. ''We haven't even touched China yet, which is going to be potentially the biggest market in the world for direct selling.''</p>
        <p>He said at least a dozen products were being developed for the United States, probably six to eight of which will come on the market next year. Extensive new products are also to be introduced in Japan and Europe.</p>
        <p>Some institutional investors agree that the stock is undervalued. They note that the company, with nearly $100 million in cash (over $3 a share) and no long-term debt, trades at 4.6 times earnings and pays a 7.8 percent dividend.</p>
        <p>Mr. Crawford said Herbalife's new team could send Wall Street a strong message by buying back shares and returning the value to shareholders.</p>
        <p>At such a low price, he said, the company is an attractive takeover target, particularly to a company looking for a strong distribution base. Herbalife has about 750,000 distributors throughout the world and recently began operations in Ireland and India. Though analysts say Herbalife has been able to maintain its domestic sales while sales have slid at other companies selling herbal products, there are concerns that with the job market tight Herbalife will have a hard time holding distributors and finding new ones.</p>
        <p>Herbalife said that it had not found that to be a problem and that the strong economy was resulting in more sales.</p>
        <p>Still, there are challenges.</p>
        <p>Diane Boesenberg, a Los Angeles distributor who was called at random last week, said she would stop selling Herbalife in August after 24 years. She said her decision was made before Mark Hughes's death and was based on lack of sales.</p>
        <p>''People are very fickle about vitamins, and I'm tired of having people order thousands of dollars of vitamins only to get stuck with them,'' she said. ''There's too much other stuff out there to choose from.''</p>
        <p>She also cited an increase, to 7 percent, in shipping and handling charges, which she said she had to pay even if she drove to a warehouse to pick up supplies. In addition, she said, distributors who had brought her in, as well as those she had recruited, were gone.</p>
        <p>''I've signed up a total of five or six distributors in the time I've done this, and they've all dropped out,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Hughes's death, she did not expect that to have any negative effect ''for the people who believe in Herbalife.''</p>
        <p>A conference in Philadelphia the weekend after the coroner's report about Mr. Hughes's death supported her speculation.</p>
        <p>John Tartol, a Malibu-based distributor who is part of the Chairman's Club, said 3,500 distributors turned out. He said he had expected to get phone calls after the release of the coroner's report. Only one came. He also expected distributors at the conference in Philadelphia to have questions about it.</p>
        <p>''They're not concerned,'' he said, adding that Mr. Hughes had struggled with pneumonia and asthma this year, perhaps coming back to work too quickly and weakening himself. ''It's kind of interesting there's been a new commitment. We're going to go out there and do it for Mark.''</p>
