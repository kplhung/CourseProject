        <p>MANHATTAN: MORE PARK ARRESTS  Five more suspects in the Central Park attacks were arrested yesterday, bringing to 25 the number accused of sexually abusing women after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade on June 11.

All three were charged with one count of sexual abuse and one count of riot.

        <p>ALBANY: WEST NILE TESTS  The State Health Department said yesterday that two more birds from Rockland County had tested positive for West Nile virus. An infected crow was found in Clarkstown and an infected blue jay was found in Orangetown. Earlier this month, the virus was found in three crows from Rockland County and New Jersey. Last year, dead birds, especially crows, were present in areas where people were found carrying the West Nile virus. Officials said Rockland County residents should use mosquito repellent outdoors at night.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: PATAKI'S BALKANS TRIP  Gov. George E. Pataki will lead a four-day, fact-finding delegation to Kosovo, Montenegro and Bosnia next week, his office announced yesterday. Others in the delegation will include members of policy-study groups, journalists, academics and business people. The group will meet with government and other leaders in the Balkans to assess security and economic concerns. The trip is being organized by the American Enterprise Institute, a policy group.

        <p>MANHATTAN: MUSLIM FIREFIGHTERS SUE  A group representing Islamic firefighters filed a lawsuit against the city in federal court in Manhattan yesterday, asserting the Fire Department discriminated against Muslim firefighters. The Fire Department's Islamic Society said the department ignored requests to add an Islamic representative to the staff of six departmental chaplains. The society also said that the department inspected mosques on Fridays, the Muslim sabbath, and that other religions were provided with prayer rooms at headquarters. A Fire Department spokesman declined to comment.</p>

        <p>SYRACUSE: ONEIDA RULING  A federal judge ruled yesterday that attempts to reach a settlement in the land-claim lawsuit filed by the Oneida nation against two counties in upstate New York had failed, forcing a trial. Judge Neal McCurn of Federal District Court in Syracuse handed down the written ruling but did not set a trial date. In their suit, the Oneidas are seeking sovereignty over 250,000 acres of land in Oneida and Madison Counties, while the counties said they would cede only 25,000 acres. As part of a deal, the state sought a quarter of revenues of an Oneida casino, which the Oneidas refused. The Oneidas have asked the court to add 20,000 landowners as defendants.</p>

        <p>YONKERS: SCHOOL PROTEST  The police arrested nine people in front of Yonkers City Hall on Wednesday as about 30 people protested the firing of the city's first black schools superintendent, Andre J. Hornsby. Singing ''We Shall Overcome,'' the protesters criticized what they called the racist policies of Mayor John Spencer, left, who appointed the school board that fired Dr. Hornsby on Friday. Nine protesters lay down on the street, snarling traffic for about 10 minutes.</p>

        <p>PATERSON: BABY DEATH  The Passaic County prosecutor's office said yesterday that it would seek an adult murder trial for a 17-year-old Paterson woman charged with throwing her 16-month-old son into the Passaic River on June 3. If a judge eventually transfers the case from New Jersey Family Court to Superior Court and the woman is convicted of murder, she will face a sentence of 30 years to life instead of the Family Court maximum of 20 years.</p>

        <p>NEWARK: WHITE SUPREMACISTS  Morris County can deny a white supremacist group permission to use the courthouse steps and lawn for a July 4 rally in Morristown, a federal judge ruled yesterday. But if the group uses another location, the county cannot force it to take out liability insurance or pay to police the event. The Nationalist Movement, based in Forsyth County, Miss., wants to protest the firing last year of Carl Williams as superintendent of the State Police after he linked drug crimes with minority groups.</p>

The Trust for Public Land, a conservation group, paid $1 million of the purchase price. The state paid $3.1 million and will own the property, which will be part of the Wildcat Ridge Wildlife Management Area.</p>
