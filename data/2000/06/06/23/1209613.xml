        <p>The independent counsel investigating President and Hillary Rodham Clinton said today that he would seek no criminal charges against Mrs. Clinton for her involvement in the firing of seven longtime White House employees in 1993.</p>

        <p>The independent counsel investigating President and Hillary Rodham Clinton said today that he would seek no criminal charges against Mrs. Clinton for her involvement in the firing of seven longtime White House employees in 1993.</p>
        <p>But the prosecutor, Robert W. Ray, said substantial evidence indicated that she played a greater role in the affair than she had portrayed in her sworn testimony.</p>
        <p>In announcing that he would not prosecute Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Ray made a point of asserting that she ''ultimately influenced'' the decision to fire the employees by repeatedly expressing her ''concerns'' to senior White House officials.</p>
        <p>The seven employees in the White House travel office were summarily dismissed a few months after the Clintons first occupied the White House and were replaced with supporters and relatives of the Clintons from Arkansas. In sworn testimony, Mrs. Clinton insisted that her role in the firings had been only peripheral.</p>
        <p>Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said tonight that the completion of the investigation of the travel office firings after several years only confirmed ''what the president and first lady have always said about this matter.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lockhart strongly objected to Mr. Ray's statement, which summarized a final report on the investigation. Mr. Ray filed the report today under seal with a three-judge panel that oversees the operation of the independent counsel.</p>
        <p>''By inappropriately characterizing the results of a legally sealed report through innuendo, the Office of Independent Counsel has further politicized an investigation that has dragged on far too long,'' Mr. Lockhart said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton first gave her version of what part she played in the firing when questioned by Congressional investigators in 1996. She depicted her role as marginal, saying she had been only vaguely aware of the situation in the travel office, which makes arrangements for the White House press corps to accompany the president on trips.</p>
        <p>She testified that she had informally asked to be kept abreast of developments but that she was preoccupied with other matters and had no idea how and why the shake-up was initiated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ray said in his statement today that his investigation demonstrated that Mrs. Clinton's conversations with several White House officials about problems at the travel office produced the climate that resulted in the dismissals of the employees by David Watkins, a senior White House administrator.</p>
        <p>He listed several senior officials with whom she shared her concerns about the travel office, including Mr. Watkins, and said ''these officials discussed her concerns among themselves, which produced a momentum to take immediate action.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ray said, ''Thus, Mrs. Clinton's concerns ultimately influenced Watkins's decision to fire the travel office employees.''</p>
        <p>In deciding not to prosecute Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Ray did not use the kind of generous exculpatory language that he used three months ago in declaring her innocent of any wrongdoing in the investigation of the White House's improper acquisition of hundreds of F.B.I. files. Instead, his words clearing Mrs. Clinton today were spare.</p>
        <p>He said that despite Mrs. Clinton's role as disclosed by the investigation, ''the evidence was insufficient to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that any of Mrs. Clinton's statements and testimony regarding her involvement in the travel office firings were knowingly false.''</p>
        <p>''Accordingly,'' he said, ''the independent counsel has declined prosecution of Mrs. Clinton.''</p>
        <p>The report filed with the special three-judge panel contains a fuller narrative of Mrs. Clinton's involvement in the firings and the testimony of several other witnesses, including Mr. Watkins.</p>
        <p>The report will be kept under seal by the judicial panel for at least three months in which time Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Watkins and any other people mentioned in it are given a chance to review portions about them and respond if they choose. Its contents might then be disclosed in the final weeks of Mrs. Clinton's senate campaign in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ray said his office had also declined to prosecute Mr. Watkins for any false statements to investigators, particularly those in which he said that he had been pressured by Mrs. Clinton to dismiss the employees.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Watkins who initially raised questions about Mrs. Clinton's statements under oath. While she had depicted herself as marginally involved, Mr. Watkins wrote a memorandum to Thomas F. McLarty III, who was then the White House chief of staff, giving a different version.</p>
        <p>The memorandum, which Mr. Watkins said was an effort to cleanse his soul about the matter, said that ''we both knew there would be hell to pay'' if ''we failed to take swift and decisive action in conformity with the first lady's wishes.''</p>
        <p>In a chronology he wrote of events leading up to the firing, Mr. Watkins quoted Mrs. Clinton as saying, ''We need those people out and we need our people in.'' He also wrote that he spoke directly to Mrs. Clinton about his efforts to dismiss the travel office employees.</p>
        <p>In addition, a week before the dismissals, he was told by Harry Thomason, a Hollywood producer and an Arkansas friend of the Clintons, that Mrs. Clinton told him she was ''ready to fire them that day.''</p>
        <p>The White House initially said the travel office employees were dismissed because of evidence of financial improprieties, but none were ever proved.</p>
        <p>White House political aides arranged for the F.B.I. to conduct an investigation after the shake-up. The head of the travel office, Billy R. Dale, was prosecuted for misuse of funds but was acquitted by a jury.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ray also said in his statement that the White House was disappointingly uncooperative in the investigation.</p>
        <p>''In contrast to the cooperation received from the White House in the F.B.I. files investigation concluded in March of this year, this office experienced substantial resistance in its efforts to obtain relevant evidence in the travel office matter,'' he said in his statement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ray's words three months ago praising White House cooperation seemed to signal a possible softening of relations between the independent counsel and the White House. Mr. Ray's predecessor, Kenneth W. Starr, was regularly assailed by White House aides and Clinton supporters as someone trying to harm the president for political reasons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ray's statement, and Mr. Lockhart's response, suggest that his office's relations with the White House remain strained.</p>
        <p>The final reports about the F.B.I. files case and the travel office are two of the last three reports Mr. Ray is planning to make before he shuts down the office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ray is expected to complete a report this fall on Mr. and Mrs. Clinton's activities in connection with the Whitewater real estate development, which gave its name to the collective investigation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ray also said he had yet to decide whether Mr. Clinton should be indicted, after his term in the White House expires, for any offenses in connection with his concealment of a relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky.</p>
