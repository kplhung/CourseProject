        <p>AS chairwoman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, Jennifer J. Raab cuts skyscrapers, and even arrogant moguls of the real estate rat race, down to size. Neighborhood character, architectural integrity: tamper with them and you answer to her; honor them and she's a friend forever.</p>
        <p>She has Woody Allen in her debt because her sepia-toned vision of the historic Carnegie Hill street where he lives -- cue the clarinets -- is right in step with his.

        <p>AS chairwoman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, Jennifer J. Raab cuts skyscrapers, and even arrogant moguls of the real estate rat race, down to size. Neighborhood character, architectural integrity: tamper with them and you answer to her; honor them and she's a friend forever.</p>
        <p>She has Woody Allen in her debt because her sepia-toned vision of the historic Carnegie Hill street where he lives -- cue the clarinets -- is right in step with his. When Citibank tried to erect a 16-story bully on the corner of 91st and Madison, she pulled the plug on the project until the developers shrink it into harmony with its surroundings.</p>
        <p>She has Harry Macklowe by the short hairs because the final piece of the puzzle at his blockbuster on Second Avenue and 53rd Street happened to be a tiny tinderbox relic built in 1866: ''I appealed to his conscience -- and his sense of public relations,'' she says, chuckling about her strategy. On Tuesday the house joined the 22,000 sites on the landmarks list. Sorry, Harry. But you did the right thing. The preservation lady says so.</p>
        <p>She has Donald Trump's ear: when he bought 40 Wall Street (buildings over 30 years old can be registered), she nixed the garish marble he sought for renovations and steered him toward an appropriate gray granite with the sympathetic savvy of a woman helping a color-blind spouse select a suit. When he wondered if he could gild the roof, she set him straight on that, too.</p>
        <p>Ms. Raab is a lawyer, so builder beware: her client -- be it a brownstone, a bridge, a water tower, a geriatric tree -- is always innocent.</p>
        <p>''People who say the preservationists are going to stop the growth of this city are dead wrong,'' insists Ms. Raab, whose agency keeps the 2 percent of city property under its jurisdiction pristine. To those who complain that the commission, particularly its 44-year-old chairwoman, guards landmarks with the bark and bite of junkyard dogs, well, bow wow.</p>
        <p>New York without a Landmarks Commission? She shudders to think, then does: ''They tore down Penn Station; it's gone forever,'' she says. ''Grand Central would either be gone or have a tower on top of it, and do you think Greenwich Village would all be rows of charming brownstones? I don't think so.''</p>
        <p>She loves her job, loves the psychic charge -- not to mention the ego boost -- from making decisions that will impact ''the built city'' forever.</p>
        <p>''It's the only job I can think of where I never minded Monday mornings,'' she says. Ms. Raab is a workaholic who got around before and since picking up her Harvard law degree: the South Bronx Development Organization, the City Planning Department, two law firms, Manhattan's Community Board 5, Joseph Rose's Senate campaign.</p>
        <p>ELEVEN years ago, coerced by a colleague, she agreed to brief Rudolph W. Giuliani, then a Republican mayoral candidate, on everything from the pro-choice platform to carriage horse etiquette. He needed to get hip to the issues of '89, and who better to fill him in than a brainy, Democratic lawyer in pony-skin pumps?</p>
        <p>Ms. Raab, an upwardly mobile product of working-class Washington Heights, a confirmed city girl who was 35 when she learned to drive and wore heels every day of her undergraduate exile upstate at Cornell -- ''No down parkas for me!'' -- never worried about defying odds.</p>
        <p>Not even when she found herself backing Mr. Giuliani against David N. Dinkins. (She had expected Mayor Edward I. Koch, of whom she had tired, to be the Democratic nominee.) She stayed the course with Mr. Giuliani, who struck her as John Lindsay-ish in his eagerness to play white knight to the city. An ambition she could relate to.</p>
        <p>In 1994, again ignoring party politics, Mr. Giuliani suggested she might make a perfect chairwoman for Landmarks: a preservationist with a pulse. With a litigator's gift of glib and spin, Ms. Raab had the tools to not only stave off the wolves at the door (developers like Mr. Trump and Mr. Macklowe) but also make converts of the preservation-wary.</p>
        <p>Ms. Raab's mother expressed some alarm at the appointment: how would her go-getter daughter, the first family member to graduate from college, first female associate at Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore to wear pants to the office, keep busy?</p>
        <p>''She pointed out that the Empire State Building was already a landmark, and Grand Central, so what was there left to do,'' says Ms. Raab, who lives in a 1929 stucco house in Riverdale, the Bronx, with her husband and 7-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>This year the commission has registered 22 sites and has 7,000 more applications to check. Along with pet projects like Bridgemarket beneath the Queensboro Bridge, Ms. Raab added modern icons like the Ford Foundation and CBS's headquarters at 51 West 52nd Street. Next week the commission will designate a swathe of Harlem. She's busy, mom.</p>
        <p>Ms. Raab oversees a $3 million municipal preservation agency, the largest in the country, with a bird's-eye view of Governors Island and a tongue-in-cheek collection of snow globes (83, none antique). ''It's a lawyer thing,'' she says. Just like the upside-down Manhattan skyline circling her neck is ''a sister thing.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Raab intended the necklace for her sister, a former ''Sex and the City'' producer, but they decided it was more about architecture in the city than sex, so it resides on the preservation lady's neck. Like the job, a swell fit.</p>
