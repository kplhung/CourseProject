        <p>Responding to published reports in several British newspapers, Mike Tyson today denied that he recently punched and broke the ribs of Frank Warren, the promoter of Tyson's fight with Lou Savarese on Saturday night, during a scuffle said to have taken place at a London hotel earlier this week.</p>
        <p>Some newspapers reported the fight as only a rumor while one London daily newspaper reported that sources said Tyson attempted to throw Warren out a window and that the fight was over money Tyson believed Warren owed him.</p>
        <p>Other reports said that Tyson broke Warren's jaw and that Warren was treated at a London hospital.</p>
        <p>Today, Tyson was asked if he hit Warren.</p>
        <p>''No, sir,'' Tyson said. ''I love Frank Warren.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he threatened to push Warren out a window, Tyson said, ''No, sir.''</p>
        <p>A reporter then asked, ''Why not?''</p>
        <p>''Because there's a long line ahead of him,'' Tyson said.</p>
        <p>Although it is highly unusual for a promoter not to attend the biggest and last media event to promote his own fight, Warren did not appear at today's news conference, which had been scheduled for weeks.</p>
        <p>Also not in attendance was Jay Larkin, a Warren associate and the executive producer and senior vice president of Showtime, the American network broadcasting the fight from Glasgow.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Warren said that he missed his plane from London to Glasgow and was busy with some legal matters. The spokeswoman also said that the promoter was preparing to sue several British newspapers for ''false and libelous statements.''</p>
        <p>A Showtime spokesman said Larkin was in a production meeting.</p>
        <p>The questioning of Tyson about whether he did or did not scuffle with Warren added a sense of chaos to a news conference that was bizarre even by the eccentric standards that boxing has set.</p>
        <p>Tyson, for example, alternately said he knew he was well liked by the boxing public, then said he did not care if the public liked him.</p>
        <p>''I'll tell you why I don't care,'' Tyson said. ''I enjoy what I do. I enjoy hurting people. That's what you come to see: to see me hurt people.</p>
        <p>''Actually, I don't know if they want to like me. Sometimes I don't like myself.''</p>
