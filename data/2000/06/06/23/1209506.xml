        <p>To have stayed alive and healthy for 30 years is no small feat for a modern dance company. But Philadanco, also known as the Philadelphia Dance Company, has done just that, and the program presented by the troupe on Tuesday at the Joyce Theater suggested why.</p>
        <p>Founded by Joan Myers Brown, a steel-willed visionary, Philadanco has grown from a grass-roots enterprise to a nationally recognized institution. With Ms. Brown, it has played an important role in promoting dance by predominantly black troupes like hers and in helping to give them a stronger voice as shapers of American dance today.</p>

        <p>To have stayed alive and healthy for 30 years is no small feat for a modern dance company. But Philadanco, also known as the Philadelphia Dance Company, has done just that, and the program presented by the troupe on Tuesday at the Joyce Theater suggested why.</p>
        <p>Founded by Joan Myers Brown, a steel-willed visionary, Philadanco has grown from a grass-roots enterprise to a nationally recognized institution. With Ms. Brown, it has played an important role in promoting dance by predominantly black troupes like hers and in helping to give them a stronger voice as shapers of American dance today.</p>
        <p>The program ''On the Shoulders of Our Ancestors'' pays homage to American dance artists who have had a particular influence on black choreographers and dancers. Its four choreographers address that influence in their dances and in their comments on the good-looking videos that precede each piece.</p>
        <p>Walter Nicks talks of Katherine Dunham. His somewhat thin ''Trance Atlantic,'' set to a musical collage, takes its performers through processionals and ensemble choreography drawn from the kinds of African, Cuban, Haitian and Brazilian dance that Ms. Dunham has put to such brilliant theatrical use.</p>
        <p>Milton Myers pays tribute to Alvin Ailey and Joyce Trisler in ''Echoes: A Celebration of Alvin Ailey,'' set to propulsive music by John Adams. There are direct quotations from Ailey dances in Mr. Myers's fast-moving stage crosses and gatherings of dancers. One can also see the influence of Trisler and Lester Horton, her mentor, as well as of the ground-skimming late jazz dances of Talley Beatty. The dynamic lead dancers were Tracy Vogt, Francisco Gella, Dawn Marie Watson and the electric Hope L. Boykin and Dion Wilson.</p>
        <p>David Brown pays cheerful lip service to Martha Graham, with whom he danced. But his ''Labess II,'' set to a cappella music by Zap Mama, is essentially just stylish, breezy play in handsomely shifting ranks created by Mr. Brown for eight dancers (Ms. Watson, Kim Y. Bears, Ms. Boykin, Ms. Vogt, Willia-Noel Montague, Mr. Wilson, Mr. Gella and Gabriele Tesfa Guma).</p>
        <p>Ronald K. Brown talks of Eleo Pomare and the writer and social activist Audre Lorde as the inspirations for his ''Gate Keepers,'' performed by Ms. Bears, Ms. Boykin, Ms. Montague, Hollie Wright, Mr. Guma and a compellingly tough Candace A. Whitaker. This is a dance whose challenges are hard to meet at the end of a program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown has described the performers as ''soldiers walking toward heaven,'' clearing a path for those who will follow. But the music, by Wunmi Olaiya, is harshly assertive, and A. Christina Giannini's drab pants and shirts suggest prison fatigues. The lighting by William H. Grant III evokes prison bars and unyielding city streets. ''Dance with me,'' a woman's voice intones. One hesitates to accept the invitation.</p>
        <p>Yet ''Gate Keepers'' and the entire suite do epitomize one important aspect of Philadanco. Ms. Brown is known for producing well-trained, go-for-broke dancers who are full of heart. Philadanco's repertory can raise the roof with the best of them. But Ms. Brown and her performers and choreographers also suggest that dance can, and perhaps should, provoke thought.</p>
        <p>Watching ''Gate Keepers,'' one thinks of the oppression Mr. Pomare addressed in his signature works and how much has changed and how much has remained the same since the late 1960's, when those dances were created. Mr. Myers's ''Echoes'' suggests the great impact ballet training has made on modern dance over the last two decades, for better and for worse.</p>
        <p>Some aspects of the program do not live up to Philadanco's highest standards. The video commentary has some surprising factual errors, and the voice-overs are distractingly overenergetic. And why, one wonders, are the four choreographers all men?</p>
        <p>But ''On the Shoulders of Our Ancestors'' brims with fine performing, food for thought and provocative choreography. And that is quite an achievement. The program will be repeated through Sunday night at the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea.</p>
