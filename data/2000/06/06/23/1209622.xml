        <p>William S Kessler letter says significance of George W Bush's C average at Yale, which Kessler also attended, is that Bush felt free to squander opportunity as just another amenity to which he was entitled; adds that Bush's smug complacency contributes to his cavalier stands toward those less fortunate</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Ally of an Older Generation Amid the Tumult of the 60's'' (front page, June 19):</p>
        <p>I entered Yale as a freshman in 1967, the year that George W. Bush was a senior, but I did not know him there. As a Jewish kid from New York, I was far removed from his social circle.</p>
        <p>The significance of Mr. Bush's C average is not lack of intelligence but that when presented with the opportunity of a Yale education, he felt free to squander it. Yale was just one of the amenities those of his background expected as a matter of course, not necessary to take seriously.</p>
        <p>The smug complacency Mr. Bush showed then has apparently continued in his cavalier stands toward those less fortunate, and is far more relevant in choosing a president than intelligence.</p>
