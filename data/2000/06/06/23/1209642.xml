        <p>The search for a star to make ABC's ''Monday Night Football'' distinctive again required 106 days and the return of the show's former producer.</p>
        <p>It included a flirtation with handing the job to Rush Limbaugh.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, after more than three months of secrecy -- astonishing for the entertainment industry -- ABC Sports introduced the irreverent comedian Dennis Miller as its choice to occupy the chair of outrageousness inaugurated by Howard Cosell.</p>
        <p>ABC also hired Dan Fouts to be its conventional analyst, but Miller will be the name discussed and debated for his appropriateness for the position.</p>
        <p>Just why is the man best known for anchoring Weekend Update on ''Saturday Night Live'' and who now specializes in rants on his HBO show working between Fouts and Al Michaels on the National Football League's flagship show?</p>
        <p>''He has one of the most perceptive comedic ways of looking at life and, in particular, of looking at football,'' said Don Ohlmeyer, who produced ''Monday Night'' in the 1970's and returned in March with a mandate to overhaul it. ''In his workout sessions, Al and I were knocked out by the depth and breadth of his knowledge of football and his ability to communicate it.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''His role is not to do X's or O's or definitive analysis of the nickel defense or to do stand-up comedy. He will bring an extremely knowledgeable fan's point of view and look at the sport with a smile.''</p>
        <p>Besides Miller and Fouts, Ohlmeyer hired two sideline reporters: Melissa Stark, a reporter for ESPN, and the former running back Eric Dickerson.</p>
        <p>Hiring Miller is the boldest gambit the show has taken since Roone Arledge, then the president of ABC Sports, hired Cosell in 1970. Cosell brought a unique, polarizing style, but he was nonetheless from the sports division.</p>
        <p>Importing Miller underscores how far ABC was willing to go to revive the notion that ''Monday Night'' can generate water cooler talk -- or postgame e-mails -- in a far more competitive entertainment environment than the 1970's.</p>
        <p>Miller, who auditioned nearly three weeks ago, said: ''I'm reasonably stunned. I think I'm a pretty quirky hire. I think I can do the job. To paraphrase a great announcer, 'Do you believe in miracles?' ''</p>
        <p>Fouts, the former San Diego Chargers quarterback, has rarely shown the star qualities associated with ''Monday Night'' during his stints calling N.F.L. games for CBS and, most recently, college football for ABC. Of course, not every star, like Joe Namath or O. J. Simpson, shone on ''Monday Night.''</p>
        <p>Ohlmeyer called Fouts a ''competent professional'' who is capable of doing far better. After analyzing tapes of Fouts's work, Ohlmeyer told him: ''The Dan Fouts I see on these tapes is not the one I want on 'Monday Night.' I want more.''</p>
        <p>Ohlmeyer said today, ''When I pushed him in the workout session, I saw sparks.''</p>
        <p>Fouts benefited because the best people at CBS and Fox, like Phil Simms, John Madden and Terry Bradshaw, are tied to ironclad contracts. Ohlmeyer was also unable to lure Jimmy Johnson out of his comfortable Florida retirement.</p>
        <p>Shortly after ABC fired Boomer Esiason as Michaels's partner on March 8, Ohlmeyer began drawing up lists of commentators. Ohlmeyer held auditions with 15 to 20 candidates for each booth slot, testing each one with Michaels on a tape of the Tennessee-Buffalo American Football Conference playoff game.</p>
        <p>Each candidate arrived at a small, nondescript studio in Burbank, Calif. Ohlmeyer asked the engineers to stay quiet about the parade of voices walking in and out, although one, Limbaugh, eagerly spoke publicly about his audition.</p>
        <p>Miller was on Ohlmeyer's list of candidates, but as someone who could provide a guest rant twice during the season. Eventually, Miller asked to be considered for a full-time gig. His audition stunned Ohlmeyer and Michaels.</p>
        <p>''I walked out of there thinking that Dennis knew as much about the National Football League as anybody we've brought in,'' Michaels said. ''Don and I walked out during a break in the session and we were speechless.''</p>
        <p>In addition to Limbaugh, Steve Young, the newly retired 49ers quarterback, was among the applicants.</p>
        <p>''I considered Rush very seriously,'' Ohlmeyer said. But he did not believe Limbaugh could devote the time to the show.</p>
        <p>The fast-talking Miller said: ''I know football like a nerd. I don't know what kind of intestinal fortitude it takes to go across the middle. So I won't try to pontificate about what someone should or shouldn't do.''</p>
        <p>Ohlmeyer insisted the changes in ''Monday Night'' were not to revive the rambunctious, contentious spirit of the series in the 1970's and 80's, when Cosell, Frank Gifford and Don Meredith transformed televised football.</p>
        <p>''Howard is gone and Don is counting his money in Santa Fe,'' he said. Gifford's last season calling games was 1997; in 1998, he played a minor role in an ill-conceived pregame studio show. Dierdorf left after the 1998 season.</p>
        <p>Ohlmeyer knows that the buzz generated by hiring Miller will evaporate if his reconstituted team does not deliver. ''There's nothing wrong with buzz,'' he said. ''I can't remember the last time people talked about 'Monday Night Football' in May or June.'' But he added, ''I'm not creating something just to have buzz for a month, then to have four months of unendurable pain.''</p>
