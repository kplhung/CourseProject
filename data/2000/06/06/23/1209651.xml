        <p>Salander-O'Reilly Galleries  20 East 79th Street  Through June 30</p>
        <p>A self-taught artist who was inspired to paint by seeing van Gogh's ''Starry Night'' and works by Klee and Picasso at the Museum of Modern Art, Gandy Brodie (1825-1975) never really went with the flow. Abstract Expressionism, Pop, Minimalism and other trends of his time brushed lightly by him or vice versa. For his unreconstructedly sensuous painting, he drew his subjects from the life around him.</p>
        <p>In this show, those subjects range from the Rembrandtesque ''Kosher Tag'' (1961), a view of a butchered animal hanging from a meat hook, to ''Demolition'' (1964), an almost abstract, mural-size grid of brick and other worn geometric segments in motley colors. Brodie reveled in the materiality of paint, stroking or palette-knifing it on in thick, rich impastos to form a surface that turns the viewer's eye into an organ of touch.</p>
        <p>In ''Saxophone Player'' (1961-63), the dark-suited performer and his bright brass instrument seem coaxed from a close-valued ground heavily brushed in blues, greens and blacks. In a lovely near-abstraction, ''Birches'' (1967), two mottled white tree trunks slowly emerge from a cool density of green-gray forest with a mysterious hint of red. No innovator, Brodie found his own strengths and stuck with them in a razzle-dazzle art scene.</p>
