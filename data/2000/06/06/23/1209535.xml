        <p>Rick Lazio, the current Republican Senate candidate from New York, once told a reporter that his favorite movie was the old Jimmy Stewart film ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' This is always a popular choice among people who hope to go to Washington themselves. But it had particular reverberations back in 1992 for Mr. Lazio, who was running for Congress as an idealistic young hero bucking the entrenched forces of corrupt politics as usual.</p>
        <p>The parallels weren't perfect. For one thing, Mr. Smith was a professional scoutmaster, while Mr. Lazio was a lawyer and longtime protege of the Suffolk County Republican Party. Mr. Smith was a perfect political virgin, who managed to get appointed to an interim Senate seat without ever having noticed that his home state had been in the grip of a corrupt machine for several decades. Things like that do not generally occur on Long Island.</p>
        <p>We digress, however. The idea of ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' was very much the theme of Mr. Lazio's career-defining House campaign in 1992. His battle cry was ''No perks, no privileges, no pay raises,'' and his pitch was that the incumbent,  Tom Downey, had become an out-of-touch, junket-taking insider.</p>
        <p>After his upset victory, the new Congressman demonstrated his determination not to join the Washington establishment by embarking on a perpetual commute. Every Monday Mr. Lazio, his pregnant wife and 1-year-old daughter crammed into the family Infiniti and drove five hours from Long Island to Washington. Every Thursday, they drove back.</p>
        <p>''It's uninterrupted family time,'' he said. ''You can talk about life.''</p>
        <p>That was then. Now Mr. Lazio is running against Hillary Rodham Clinton, and he seems to have adjusted his view on perks, privileges, etc.:</p>
        <p>* Newly released financial records show that Mr. Lazio led the New York delegation in number of trips taken on other people's tabs in 1999. A good-government group called one outing to Virginia that was paid for by the Mortgage Bankers Association ''a good example of a trip that a member shouldn't take'' when he happens to be head of a subcommittee that regulates home mortgages.</p>
        <p>* He turns out to have voted for a Congressional pay raise after all. Recently Mr. Lazio told The Washington Post it was because the bill included a provision that would help find missing children.</p>
        <p>* Last week Mr. Lazio skipped a close vote on a bill to create a home heating oil reserve for the Northeast to rush home to campaign. A spokesman said he needed to catch the last shuttle out.</p>
        <p>* The New York Times recently revealed that in 1997 Mr. Lazio made an uncharacteristically risky investment in stock options in a company that was controlled by some of his contributors. He realized a 600 percent gain after it became a takeover target two weeks later. ''Some stocks you get lucky on and some you're unlucky on,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>This was all in the last week or so -- a Senate campaign start-up worthy of the early Hillary Clinton. There was also a flap over a CBS report in which  Mr. Lazio vowed to run a clean campaign without acting like ''a pansy.'' When a gay journalist objected, the Lazio campaign said he was referring to the flower.</p>
        <p>I think I am speaking for everyone in saying that it was a relief when Mr. Lazio stopped dragging his family up and down the Northeast Corridor. But you'd think he'd have hung around to support that heating oil bill and taken the opportunity to get re-acquainted with the federal highway system. (Defenders quickly pointed out that five members of the New York City delegation also left before the vote. But the New York City delegation, which has the average intelligence of a large turnip, is not the ideal we want to shoot for.)</p>
        <p>If you win your seat by running pictures of the incumbent Jet Skiing in the Caribbean, as Mr. Lazio did in 1992, you really should not let the Developers Tax Credit Conference fly you to Florida, as he did in 1999. And a guy like Mr. Lazio, who never made a fancy investment until he was appointed to two committees that regulate the securities industry, must have known this was not the time to start playing the stock market.</p>
        <p>At minimum, he ruined his chance to make an issue of Mrs. Clinton's cattle futures deal. At worst, he opened the door for us to point out that Jimmy Stewart would have put his investments in a blind trust.</p>
