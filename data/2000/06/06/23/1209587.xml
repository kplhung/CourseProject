        <p>She came to Albert J. Pirro Jr.'s tax fraud trial, nudging him to fix his tie and shaking her head when he got too friendly with the reporters. Even as embarrassing details spilled out about his illegitimate child and their lavish lifestyle, she remained at his side.</p>
        <p>If Jeanine F. Pirro, Westchester county's ambitious district attorney, ever lost faith in her husband, she did not show it. Not even today. She was there again at the federal courthouse, subdued in a coral-hued silk shirt, tan suit and three-inch heels as Mr. Pirro was convicted on 34 counts of tax evasion and conspiracy.</p>
        <p>But as the Pirros huddled together afterward, the most frequently asked questions were not about him, but about her and whether her career could rebound from his downfall. Would she continue to stick by him? And, at what price?</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Pirro who answered, speaking about their futures -- his and hers -- in separate terms. ''Jeanine's career and what Jeanine has ahead of her is distinctly different,'' Mr. Pirro said. ''This is my problem, it has been my problem, and it is my responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Pirro herself dodged those questions as she disappeared into a black sports utility vehicle that sped away from the courthouse. But several observers said that she could not so easily escape the damage wrought by the trial.</p>
        <p>''He may lose his law license but he's going to be a businessman forever,'' said Bennett Gershman, a law professor at Pace University who attended the trial.''I think her prospects are bleak,'' he said. ''This is a devastating blow to her career. I mean this is not a case where she was a peripheral figure. She had to know something.''</p>
        <p>Sharp-witted and ever stylish, Mrs. Pirro, 49, has long been considered a serious Republican contender for New York's top elected offices. She has earned the requisite credentials, first as a county court judge and then as a district attorney crusading against domestic violence.</p>
        <p>She also embodies a winning demographic makeup. She is a woman in a party that has trouble fielding strong female candidates, a leader in a key suburban county that could swing either Republican or Democratic, and, unlike another high-profile woman currently running for office, she is a native New Yorker, born in Elmira.</p>
        <p>Not so long ago, Mrs. Pirro was the one that many Republicans had hoped could defeat Hillary Rodham Clinton in the United States Senate race.</p>
        <p>Yet no small part of Mrs. Pirro's appeal has been her husband of more than 20 years -- a real estate lawyer, big-ticket Republican fund-raiser, and one of Westchester's leading dealmakers. Although the Pirros scrupulously maintained the appearance of separate professional lives, Mr. Pirro made no secret of trying to advance his wife's career.  But in the fickle world of politics, where voters must be wooed over and over, any shortcomings -- even those of a spouse -- can doom a political career.</p>
        <p>That was learned the hard way by another New Yorker, Geraldine A. Ferraro, the one-time Democratic vice presidential nominee who lost her party's nomination for Senate in 1992 and 1998 after her opponents made allegations that her husband, John A. Zaccaro, had ties to organized crime.</p>
        <p>For female politicians, the appearance of a misbehaving spouse can be especially hard to overcome in a society that has traditionally defined a woman's place in life by her husband's successes, or his failures.</p>
        <p>Take former Congresswoman Enid Greene Waldholtz. A once-promising Republican from Utah, her career was cut short in 1996 after it was revealed that her husband illegally financed her campaign. She offered weepy apologies and filed for divorce, but public disapproval swelled.</p>
        <p>''Women face enormous difficulties just on their own,'' said Judith Saidel, director of the Center for Women in Government at the State University of New York at Albany. ''And now you layer on that complication caused by one's spouse and it does really jack up the odds against women's progress as candidates.''</p>
        <p>While Mrs. Pirro was not charged with any wrongdoing, she was a persistent figure in the prosecution's case. It focused relentlessly on the family's spending and lifestyle and tax deductions on items like their $13,250 Chinese rug, the $1,800 wrought-iron pen for their Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs and the $4,450 portrait of their children, which Mrs. Pirro wanted in time for a dinner party.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Pirro's loyal supporters -- and she still has many -- say that voters today are savvy enough to recognize Mr. Pirro's legal transgressions as his own. ''Once this is all behind her, no matter how it turns out, she will continue to be an outstanding public figure in Republican politics,'' said State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Republican from Westchester County.</p>
        <p>And Gerald Benjamin, dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the State University of New York at New Paltz, added that voters were more open and forgiving than they used to be.</p>
        <p>''She has shown absolute loyalty to her husband,'' Mr. Benjamin said. ''To me, that counts. I put great stock in keeping your commitments. It's revealing of character.''</p>
        <p>The most obvious testament of a wife rising above her husband's misfortunes may be the one that Mrs. Pirro least cares for. Less than a year after President Clinton's impeachment, Mrs. Clinton has rebounded from stoic wife to standard-bearer for the state's Democratic Party -- without leaving her husband far behind.</p>
