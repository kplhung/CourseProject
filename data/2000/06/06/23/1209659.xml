        <p>DETAILS of the case, at least those that have been made public, are skimpy, but maybe that's just as well. It is hard to imagine that they are anything but sickening.</p>
        <p>What we know is that the life of Nia Gay, all eight months of it, came to an end last week at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. We know that a young man living on the Grand Concourse took Nia to the hospital two days earlier, saying she had fallen off a bed. We know she was unconscious at the time, and never recovered.</p>
        <p>We know this as well: the Bronx district attorney's office does not believe that the baby happened to tumble from a bed. It says her death was caused by ''fatal child abuse syndrome with whiplash from shaking said baby and multiple impacts to the baby's head, torso and extremities.'' Even the soulless language of officialdom cannot camouflage the image of an infant being thrashed mercilessly into lifelessness.</p>
        <p>There is one more thing that we know. The man who took Nia to Montefiore, Miguel Martinez, was her mother's boyfriend. Mr. Martinez, 22, now stands accused of killing the baby, charged formally with first-degree manslaughter and endangering the welfare of a child.</p>
        <p>Whether he is guilty remains, of course, to be determined. But the known facts in this case are already enough to revive an issue that has surfaced with disturbing regularity in recent years. Call it, if you will, the boyfriend-as-menace syndrome.</p>
        <p>Whatever Mr. Martinez's fate, child-welfare experts say it has been amply clear for a while that, in general, having the mother's boyfriend around the house is one of the greater safety threats that small children can face. That is especially true if the man is a layabout with a temper. All too often, he resents the children -- because they were fathered by someone else, because they cost money and because they compete with him for mommy's attention.</p>
        <p>''The presence of an unrelated male in the home is considered a very high-risk factor, and caseworkers across the country are trained to keep an eye out for it,'' said Nicholas Scoppetta, commissioner of the city's Administration for Children's Services.</p>
        <p>No one, Mr. Scoppetta included, suggests viewing with suspicion every young man who moves in with a woman raising children on her own, the natural father having taken an all-too-familiar powder. All that's being said is that the potential for harm increases greatly when mommy brings home a new ''uncle.''</p>
        <p>Statistics that shore up this point are not easy to come by, for there are few studies. But two Canadian psychologists, Martin Daly and Margo O. Wilson of McMaster University in Ontario, have concluded after examining murder rates in Chicago and Detroit that American children are 40 times more likely to be killed by a step-parent than by a natural parent.</p>
        <p>They use ''step-parent'' for any ''marital-like relationship.'' What they mean, in practical terms, is a live-in boyfriend. ''The extra risk looks undeniable,'' Dr. Wilson said. If anything, the problem seems to be growing, said Kevin Kirkpatrick, a spokesman for Prevent Child Abuse America, a group based in Chicago.</p>
        <p>CERTAINLY in New York, the anecdotal evidence is there, with one stomach-wrenching case after another in the last few years.</p>
        <p>A Brooklyn man beat his girlfriend's 15-month-old daughter into unconsciousness. A mother's boyfriend in the Bronx sent a 2-year-old girl to the hospital by kicking her sharply in the stomach. A Manhattan man shook his girlfriend's 4-month-old boy so hard that the baby's eyes bled. The baby's offense: crying while the boyfriend tried to watch the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>The obvious question is how to stop the horror. Answers, sadly, are not so obvious.</p>
        <p>Social conservatives suggest making it a stigma, as it once was, for couples to live together out of wedlock. They urge mothers of small children to shut the door on those ''uncles.'' Sounds good. The problem, others say, is that fathers who stick around are in short supply in many neighborhoods, and they ask if you can blame a lonely, needy woman for turning to another man for financial, emotional and physical support.</p>
        <p>''You want to encourage women to provide father figures, but not at a risk to the child,'' said Dr. Jacqueline Campbell, a specialist in family violence at the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>Finding the right balance is hard. But one thing is for sure. In this city, it has eluded the mothers of too many children who now lie in the ground.</p>
