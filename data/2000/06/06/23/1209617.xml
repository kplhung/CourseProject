        <p>Adopting the highest increases since 1996, the New York City Rent Guidelines Board last night approved 4 percent for one-year leases and 6 for two-year leases.</p>
        <p>The increases cover the city's one million rent-stabilized apartments and apply to leases renewed between Oct. 1, 2000, and Sept. 30, 2001.</p>
        <p>The board also adopted a $15-a-month surcharge on all apartments  renting for less than $500. Tenant advocates, who had hoped to see that provision dropped, called it a ''poor tax'' on the people least able to pay. But landlords said it was needed to help them meet the basic overhead costs of operation.</p>
        <p>For lofts, the board approved increases of 3 percent for one-year leases and 5 percent for two-year leases. It also adopted a 2 percent increase for one-year leases for residents of hotels, rooming and lodging houses and single-room-occupancy apartments.</p>
        <p>Although the board went through its ritual series of failed motions for bigger and smaller increases, in the end the adopted resolutions closely followed the preliminary proposals the board issued last month.</p>
        <p>A tenant-dominated crowd of about 300 booed and jeered the board's actions, which were taken in the auditorium of Cooper Union. But tensions were much reduced compared with last week's public hearing, when board officials ordered the police to eject several people for outbursts, and four were arrested.</p>
        <p>''Freeze our rents, freeze our rents,'' the crowd began chanting last night. Overpowered in decibels, the board decided to take a strategic recess. Then 15 or 20 demonstrators occupied the stage and even commandeered the board's chairs and microphones. Some carried signs saying: ''Rudy don't raise our rent.''</p>
        <p>The board chairman, Edward S. Hochman, took the protest in stride and even posed briefly with some  demonstrators for news photographers. After a few minutes, plainclothes police officers gently ushered the protesters off the stage, and eventually the board members reappeared and resumed the meeting.</p>
        <p>Landlord groups had sought far bigger increases -- 9 percent for one year and 15 percent for two -- citing soaring fuel oil prices and other costs.</p>
        <p>''We tried to convince some board members that the soaring oil prices that some say is a temporary spike is not a temporary spike,'' said Joseph Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents apartment-building owners.</p>
        <p>But tenant advocates had called for no rent increases, contending that rising landlord profits meant that owners were already overcompensated.</p>
        <p>''Disgraceful -- the whole process was disgraceful,'' said Michael McKee, the associate director of the New York Tenants and Neighbors Coalition. ''Tenants can't get a break from the Giuliani administration.''</p>
        <p>Before the voting began, Mr. Hochman said, ''This has obviously been a difficult year for the board.'' Anticipating both the board's decision and the reactions to it, he said, ''If we upset both sides, we have probably done the best job we can.''</p>
        <p>For five of the last six years, the board has echoed the economy's low-inflation trends by approving modest increases of 2 percent for one-year leases and 4 percent for two-year leases.</p>
        <p>The one exception came in 1996, when the board approved increases of 5 percent and 7 percent. The major issue this year -- as in 1996 -- was soaring prices for fuel oil for heat and hot water.</p>
        <p>Tenant advocates contended that oil costs fluctuate and complained that although the 1996 rise in prices proved to be temporary, rents were never lowered to make up for it. Landlords countered that they had  already suffered this year by paying high oil prices not covered by the last rent increase. They also cited predictions of continued high prices.</p>
        <p>Over the years, the board's increases have tended to moderate the swings in operating costs, restraining rent increases during high inflation and making up for that with modest increases during low inflation, Mr. Hochman said.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully, things have worked out in the long term as fairly as possible,'' Mr. Hochman said.</p>
        <p>Studies by the rent board's staff showed that operating prices experienced virtually zero increases in 1997 and 1998, although the board raised rents anyway. But the latest study showed that operating prices had jumped by 7.8 percent.</p>
        <p>Another issue is profits. Board studies showed that landlords had reaped record income coupled with the smallest increase in expenses in nearly a decade, based on tax department data for 1998, the most recent available.</p>
        <p>Net operating income rose by 11.8 percent, which exceeded the previous year's record of 11.4 percent. The board has been tracking net income for nine years.</p>
        <p>Tenants said that the statistics showed that any increase was unwarranted. But owner representatives said the numbers were misleading because their industry was still recovering from a collapse in the real estate market in the late 1980's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hochman caused fear in tenants earlier this year when he proposed adopting formula calculations that could have produced increases of 8.5 percent for one-year leases and 12 percent for two-year leases.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who appoints the board, immediately distanced himself from that proposal, calling such increases ''very, very high.''</p>
