        <p>The Pentagon announced yesterday that it would award the most lucrative fighter jet contract in history, totaling over $200 billion, to one company -- either Lockheed Martin or Boeing.</p>
        <p>The decision ends months of speculation that the Pentagon might split the contract and give a portion to each company. In a letter to Congress yesterday, William S. Cohen, the defense secretary, emphasized that the program, as originally planned, would continue. Then, in a later news conference, Jacques Gansler, the defense under secretary for acquisition and technology, was more explicit, saying that the winner-take-all approach ''makes the most sense to us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gansler did say, however, that the Pentagon had been evaluating ''in-house a set of alternatives'' to this single-company approach before making yesterday's statement.</p>
        <p>The move highlights the Pentagon's highly unusual decision to introduce commercial-world practices in the design and production of the next generation of fighter jets, the Joint Strike Fighter, a plane that is being made in three versions, one for each branch of the military. The Pentagon envisions that the plane, a low-cost fighter with stealth capability, will be used by the United States and its allies and expects that more than 2,800 of these aircraft will be made domestically.</p>
        <p>By awarding one contract the Pentagon is not only introducing a greater level of competition, but it is also eliminating the possibility that the plane would be constructed by two companies at two production sites -- which might have saved jobs at military contractors but would have increased the program's overall cost.</p>
