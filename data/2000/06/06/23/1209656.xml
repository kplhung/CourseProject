        <p>Few artists are as gifted at comic self-portrayal as the ceramicist Robert Arneson (1930-1992), whose mission was to model his own likeness in a multiplicity of guises. A dozen versions appear in this first commercial gallery survey of Arneson self-portraits, concentrating on work done in the 1970's and 80's, from a very pink Santa Claus to a scary, scowling mask in black and white that suggests a searcher scratching at his own dark soul.</p>
        <p>''Brick With Cigar/Brick With Nose'' (1975) takes a narrow view by putting one brick on top of another, their lengthwise ends carved separately; one with eyes and a nose, the other with a cigar-chomping mouth. (A cigar was a feature of Arneson's face.) A more expansive Arneson is seen in a huge, rube-ish head called ''Cheek'' (1977), mounted on a pink base labeled with that title and wearing a ''What, me worry?'' smile. A Band-Aid adorns one cheek.</p>
        <p>The tiniest work in the show is a maquette for ''Smorgi Bob, the Cook'' (1971), a Roman-type bust in shiny white glazed ceramic in which he wears a chef's toque and sticks out a wee red tongue. The funniest is the 1975 ''Trophy (For Soap Box Derby),'' a goggled and helmeted hunkered-down head with a mean out-to-win expression and the usual cigar. The jester-type pointed helmet is adorned with silver racing car models.</p>
        <p>This show barely hints at the many personas Arneson conjured up: since the mid-60's self-portraiture was his preoccupation. But it does give the sense of a maverick talent, in total command of his medium, who in his cartoony explorations hit not only on himself but on everyman as well.</p>
