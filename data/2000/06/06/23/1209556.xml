        <p>Diageo P.L.C., the expansive British food and spirits company, said yesterday that it planned to sell a 20 percent stake in Burger King, the fast-food chain. The sale could be a first step in an eventual spinoff, a goal of Diageo for years.</p>
        <p>Diageo officials said that the offering of Burger King stock on the New York Stock Exchange could be made by spring 2001, and that the remainder could be sold as early as December 2002, when the company's tax liabilities would fall significantly.</p>
        <p>The announcement came as Diageo also announced the surprise departure of Dennis Malamatinas, Burger King's chief executive. Mr. Malamatinas, who left his family in Britain four years ago to run Burger King from its Miami headquarters, said he was unwilling to remain for the extra time needed to take Burger King public.</p>
        <p>Diageo said that Mr. Malamatinas would take a job in Europe at an unspecified American company and that Colin Storm, head of Diageo's Guinness division, would temporarily replace him at Burger King.</p>
        <p>Since the food giant Grand Metropolitan and the beer maker Guinness merged to create Diageo in 1997, company officials have talked about selling Burger King. But they have been hampered by the prospect of paying roughly $1.5 billion in taxes if they did so before 2002. Analysts have estimated the entire value of Burger King at somewhere between $2.4 billion and $4.5 billion.</p>
        <p>Last October, company officials say, United States tax law was changed to allow foreign companies to sell up to 20 percent in an American subsidiary at a lower rate. That change provided Diageo with the window it was seeking.</p>
        <p>With such widely recognized names as Haagen-Dazs, Smirnoff and Pillsbury, Diageo has come under investor pressure to strengthen its stock by taking some brands public. Analysts say Burger King, a retail chain that never quite fit within the company's rubric of packaged goods, is a logical choice, particularly because conflict with owners of franchises has made it increasingly difficult to manage.</p>
        <p>Angered by an increase in royalty rates scheduled for July and an expensive refurbishment plan, franchise owners, who run more than 90 percent of Burger King's restaurants, pressed for a separation from Diageo in April.</p>
        <p>''The renovations could cost well over $100,000 per store,'' said Mitchell Speiser, senior analyst at Lehman Brothers. ''That's a lot of money for someone who owns a couple of stores and is trying to put their kids through college, especially since it's not proven it will work.''</p>
        <p>Burger King lost market share to competitors last year, slipping from 20.4 percent of the American market to 19.6 percent, according to Technomics, which tracks the industry. Sales were also flat, compared with increases of 3 percent at McDonald's and 8 percent at Wendy's.</p>
        <p>Burger King offered a challenge to McDonald's in the mid-1990's, but a slowdown in marketing, promotions and new products last year has kept it in second place. ''It's not fun competing against McDonald's,'' said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with ING Barings. ''It's sort of like taking on the Lakers in the Forum.''</p>
        <p>The prospect of a Burger King spinoff raised speculation yesterday that a spinoff or sale of Pillsbury could follow. Company officials did not rule out that possibility, but stressed that the Burger King sale should not be interpreted as a ''dry run'' for its Pillsbury division.</p>
