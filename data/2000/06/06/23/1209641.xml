        <p>They scored 22 runs on Monday, beat Pedro Martinez on Tuesday, and yet the Yankees walked out of here barely in second place tonight, over the cracked foundation of Fenway Park, with nothing more than a split of the four-game series with the Boston Red Sox.</p>

        <p>They scored 22 runs on Monday, beat Pedro Martinez on Tuesday, and yet the Yankees walked out of here barely in second place tonight, over the cracked foundation of Fenway Park, with nothing more than a split of the four-game series with the Boston Red Sox.</p>
        <p>It is the nature of the Yankees right now, an inconsistency that is becoming the most consistent aspect of the team. Ramiro Mendoza and Andy Pettitte might have been spectacular Monday and Tuesday, but tonight, the 22-year-old rookie Jake Westbrook was knocked out before the end of the third inning in a 4-2 loss to the Red Sox.</p>
        <p>Nomar Garciaparra keyed two Boston rallies with doubles, and Ramon Martinez pitched six and two-thirds solid innings in getting the victory for the Red Sox.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, now a half-game behind Boston and in a virtual tie with Toronto, begin a three-game series Friday night in Chicago, and once again, they will be forced to plug their injury-plagued rotation. Ben Ford, 25, has eight major league appearances and two professional starts after 282 relief appearances, and he will be promoted from Class AAA Columbus to start against the White Sox. Westbrook was informed after tonight's game that he is being sent back to Columbus, as expected.</p>
        <p>The Yankee players became aware of a possible trade for Juan Gonzalez after the game. Ricky Ledee, one of the players who would go to Detroit for the slugging outfielder, was surrounded by reporters, and his teammates whispered among  themselves, asking why. Players spoke carefully in response to news of the pending deal.</p>
        <p>Gonzalez ''is an m.v.p.-type player,'' said David Cone, the Yankees' pitcher. ''We have a great clubhouse that could really help him.''</p>
        <p>Jorge Posada is a friend of Ledee's and seemed sad to hear the Yankee outfielder's name mentioned in the trade talks. But Posada acknowledged Gonzalez's potential.</p>
        <p>''He's very special,'' Posada said. ''He's one of those people that brings a presence every time he goes to the plate. He would fit right in the lineup. He's a good hitter. He drives in 120-plus runs every year, hits 30-plus home runs. We'll see what happens.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees ate, showered and dressed, unsure of who will be playing the outfield in Chicago Friday and disappointed at the outcome of the series here.</p>
        <p>''After beating Pedro on Tuesday, we had visions of winning three and maybe four games here,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager. ''Winning two is a disappointment. We need to put together a streak for confidence. I thought we had something going after winning the first two.''</p>
        <p>They could have won three, but fell behind early tonight. Westbrook lasted only one and two-thirds innings in his first start against the White Sox last week, allowing six runs. But Westbrook came back the next day and, at the end of a one-sided defeat, pitched two and one-third scoreless innings, and the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre hoped Westbrook could build off the confidence gleaned in that second appearance.</p>
        <p>Westbrook did look good early tonight, striking out the leadoff hitter Jose Offerman on a called third strike before retiring Jeff Frye and Trot Nixon for a 1-2-3 inning. The fact that John Hirschbeck, who calls one of the most generous strike zones in baseball, was the umpire behind home plate was good fortune for Westbrook.</p>
        <p>Bernie Williams had bashed a very long two-run homer in the top of the first inning, his 16th, and the Yankees had a 2-0 lead.</p>
        <p>But the Red Sox began smashing line drives in the second inning and drove Westbrook from the mound before the end of the third. ''His fastball was good,'' Torre said. ''I think he just got in trouble with his secondary pitches.''</p>
        <p>Garciaparra began the second with the first of two doubles against Westbrook, and Carl Everett singled home Garciaparra and eventually scored on a sacrifice fly.</p>
        <p>Frye doubled inside the first-base line with one out in the third inning. Westbrook walked Nixon and Garciaparra pushed Frye across with a double. Jason Grimsley quickly jumped to his feet in the bullpen and started throwing, while Stottlemyre walked slowly to the mound; it was evident that Westbrook's outing was going to end soon.</p>
        <p>Everett was walked intentionally, and with the count 1-0 on Brian Daubach, Grimsley nodded in the bullpen that he was ready. The bullpen coach Tony Cloninger relayed word to Jeff Nelson, who picked up the phone to inform Stottlemyre and Torre in the Yankees' dugout.</p>
        <p>But Torre did not make a change immediately, possibly because he had watched Grimsley walk three in a span of five hitters Wednesday night and did not want to call on him with the bases loaded.</p>
        <p>Daubach singled to left field, driving home Nixon with Boston's fourth run. Ledee threw home and the ball beat Garciaparra, who appeared to elude the tag but was called out.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees were down by 4-2, would never recover and took that long walk out of Fenway after the game, into the muggy Boston night.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>CHUCK KNOBLAUCH, the Yankees' second baseman, made his 14th error of the season with another wild throw. He fielded several grounders early in the game, making one nice play and throwing tentatively on a couple of others, but always completing the play. However, Knoblauch fielded a routine bouncer by JOSE OFFERMAN with two outs in the fourth, turned and fired the ball far to the right of the first baseman TINO MARTINEZ. As the throw skipped off a side wall and bounced behind home plate, with JORGE POSADA in pursuit, Knoblauch spun around, disgusted. The Boston fans roared. When the inning was over, fans behind the Yankees dugout stood and screamed at Knoblauch, and the shortstop DEREK JETER stopped and appeared to be answering some of the fans. Knoblauch's error -- his 10th throwing error -- did not cost the Yankees a run.</p>
        <p>The Red Sox had a major scare in the top of the seventh inning. The All-Star shortstop NOMAR GARCIAPARRA backpedaled for a popup by RICKY LEDEE. As he made the catch, Garciaparra collided with the center fielder CARL EVERETT. Garciaparra's legs were cut out from under him, and he lay on the ground for several minutes. But Garciaparra eventually rose and remained in the game.</p>
