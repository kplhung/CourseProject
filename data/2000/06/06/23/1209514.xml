        <p>''Twelfth Night'' is something of a community affair in the version mounted by the Gorilla Repertory Theater in Fort Tryon Park.

        <p>''Twelfth Night'' is something of a community affair in the version mounted by the Gorilla Repertory Theater in Fort Tryon Park. This is the second year that Gorilla, a late-summer fixture in Washington Square Park, is taking its free Shakespeare to this spectacular setting almost at the northern tip of Manhattan. The company presents ''Macbeth'' on Thursdays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. and ''Twelfth Night'' on Fridays and Sundays, also at 8.</p>
        <p>Feste the clown begins drawing the audience into the action early on, pulling children from the crowd to join in his songs and dances. Very soon almost everyone but Malvolio treats the onlookers, including dogs, like part of the ensemble.</p>
        <p>The audience goes wild for this. The action is arranged to swirl around it in a great circle so no one has to move around to follow the play, but in no time viewers are jumping up and running around to follow the actors as scenes change. Altogether, the atmosphere is a good deal more like that of a 19th-century Viennese comic operetta than a conventional presentation of Shakespeare.</p>
        <p>It works better for ''Twelfth Night'' than one might expect; the play's constant refocusing to resolve all the confusion of identities, passions and purposes is more transparent and effective than usual. In fact, the charming, good-natured foolishness of the plot seems well suited to the approach taken by the director, Christopher Carter Sanderson, and the performers -- so casual it often seems ad-libbed.</p>
        <p>The neighborhood is also perfect for it. When Antonio (Bruce Barton), Sebastian (Jo Benincasa) and Viola (Katherine Gooch) start swapping tales of getting lost on the water and washing up on the Illyrian coast, one thinks, ''Why not?'' Directly behind the lawn that is their stage the park drops almost perpendicularly to the edge of the Hudson, where the lights of boats and barges twinkle up and down the estuary. And this must be Illyria, since the baseball cap worn by the top man (Michael Colby Jones as Orsino) has the name of the country emblazoned on the front (and you know he's the boss since the band on the back reads ''The Duke'').</p>
        <p>Sometimes this approach is way over the top. The clown (Doron Toister) can get on your nerves. Sir Toby Belch (Russell Marcel) and Sir Andrew Aguecheeck (John Walsh) often seem to be working too hard for laughs. Antonio's puzzlement over the two Sebastians is not persuasive, and Olivia (Julie Thaxter-Gourlay) may live in a palace, but she is seldom a lady. However, in this friendly uproar it is easy to ignore such small annoyances.</p>
        <p>But one result of this transformation of the play cannot be ignored: Malvolio (Brian Olsen) becomes the principal character. The fact that he is the only person in the play who is deliberately made a victim of fraud stands out much more clearly here than in most productions and leaves one with the distinct impression that the playfulness of all the other characters is not as innocent as one would like. The impression is strong enough to make you read the play carefully again to see if Shakespeare might have thought of that, too.</p>
        <p>TWELFTH NIGHT</p>
        <p>By William Shakespeare; directed and designed by Christopher Carter Sanderson; stage manager, Kina Bermudez. Presented by the Gorilla Repertory Theater Company. At Fort Tryon Park, at West 190th Street, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>WITH: Michael Colby Jones (Orsino), Katherine Gooch (Viola/Cesario), Nick Janik (Maria), Doron Toister (Feste), Julie Thaxter-Gourlay (Olivia), Brian Olsen (Malvolio), Bruce Barton (Antonio), Russell Marcel (Sir Toby Belch), John Walsh (Sir Andrew Aguecheeck) and Jo Benincasa (Sebastian).</p>
