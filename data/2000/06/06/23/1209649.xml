        <p>Nancy Margolis  560 Broadway, at Prince Street  SoHo  Through June 30</p>
        <p>Jack Earl's small, off-beat, lovingly detailed ceramic narratives center on a hapless Everyman named Bill, a rubbery-limbed bumpkin in blue jeans, a red work shirt and a red billed cap. Bill is a down-to-earth fellow in a terrestrial world -- a rural denizen of his creator's home state of Ohio, one imagines -- but his adventures tend to the surreal.</p>
        <p>In this, Mr. Earl's sixth New York solo show since 1972, the most impressive piece combines several scenes into one funny, in-the-round retelling of the Faust myth. Bill takes a stray dog into his extravagantly slovenly home (note the socks drying on the furnace in the living room), whereupon the dog turns into a miniature Bill who declares himself to be Mephistopheles and asks to stay; Bill opens the screen door and kicks him out. (The story is also narrated in words inscribed on a faux-carved stone pedestal that supports the section of earth on which Bill's house is built.)</p>
        <p>With its muted colors, matte surfaces and funky realism, the sculpture looks like the work of a zany hobbyist and has the uncanny air of a ''Twilight Zone'' episode.</p>
