        <p>In 1993 Lecreca Duffy of Alaska was in an auto accident. In 1992 Cindy Robinson of Idaho was in an auto accident. Each woman's doctor diagnosed activity-reducing injuries and suggested extensive treatment. Each woman's auto insurance company required a second medical opinion before authorizing payment.</p>
        <p>Each company -- actually, the same company in both cases -- sharply reduced compensation based on that second opinion, each time from evaluators who had never met the patient and based their report solely on a review of medical records.</p>
        <p>The practice, known as a ''paper review,'' falls under the critical gaze of ''Dateline NBC'' tonight in a segment that proves network news magazines can still produce compelling reports in a genre that has lately seemed desperate for material.</p>
        <p>This ''Dateline'' segment, titled ''The Paper Chase,'' is based on a 15-month investigation. The correspondent, John Larson, narrates the bureaucratic and apparently profit-minded system that denied payment for vital treatment to Ms. Duffy, Ms. Robinson and, by implication, many other policyholders.</p>
        <p>Each woman had a policy with State Farm Insurance, which often employs outside companies, as do other large insurance companies, for objective analyses of medical information when it evaluates claims. The ''Dateline'' report acknowledges that such analyses may be medically useful, but not in the chilling practices of two such paper review companies, Comprehensive Medical Review and Medical Claims Review Services.</p>
        <p>In Ms. Duffy's case, for instance, ''Dateline'' interviews a former employee of Comprehensive Medical Review. He is a journalist who acknowledges he has no medical training; he says he basically cobbled his reports from stock paragraphs suggested by the company, almost all intended to minimize injuries. In fact, injury is a word that company policy suggests writers avoid because it is ''inflammatory.'' Pain is also risky, the policy says; it suggests discomfort.</p>
        <p>These reports are supposed to be approved by doctors, but another company insider, interviewed on camera with features obscured, says such approvals amount to little more than ''autograph sessions'' by often uninterested doctors handling 30 or more files an hour. Worse, Ms. Duffy's report bears the approval of a doctor who says his signature was forged; ''Dateline'' suggests the evaluation was approved not by a medical expert, but by management.</p>
        <p>''Could this really be true?,'' Mr. Larson asks after one such revelation, a hype-inducing moment atypical of this mostly sober, authoritative report. ''The Paper Chase'' concentrates on the larger systemic issues of its subject, focusing on the human consequences of paper reviews and their apparent motivation: money. ''Dateline'' interviews a former State Farm executive who says, ''There's only one motivation for using a paper review, and that's to increase profits by reducing costs.''</p>
        <p>The disturbing comment resonates in the context of the struggles of Ms. Duffy and Ms. Robinson, who are shown grappling with pain, debts and despair. Both women have since reached settlements, but they retain reason to distrust their insurance. After seeing this report, many viewers may feel the same way.</p>
        <p>REEL NEW YORK  Channel 13, tonight at 10</p>
        <p>Tonight's segments of ''Reel New York,'' inspired by gay and lesbian pride month, have the feel of community television, in a good sense of the word.</p>
        <p>The pair of video documentary shorts, collectively titled ''Breaking Gay Ground,'' don't aim for professional polish; they aim to serve a specific audience as a gentle advocate. Both segments etch faces, great time-worn faces, onto ideas that seek not to impress but to affect, to work. The delight of ''Breaking Gay Ground'' is its simplicity.</p>
        <p>The second segment, ''Gay and Gray in New York City,'' has the more overt concern: the value and needs of older lesbians and gay men. The directors, Julie Englander, Nicholas Chesla and Cindi Creager, introduce several New Yorkers who recall their pasts and discuss their legacy to a new generation. A lesbian couple, Ellen Ensig-Brodsky and Nancy Spannbauers, explain their efforts in organizations like Pride Senior Network, which seeks to meet the needs of the gay elderly. Rex Wilder, rather shyly, shares the hundreds of letters he and his lover exchanged in the 1940's, letters he hopes to donate to a worthy archive.</p>
        <p>They and others interviewed remind viewers that gay and lesbian youths don't have enough role models for aging, and that American gay history needs to retrieve truths and dramas of its pre-Stonewall generation.</p>
        <p>That history gets a personal anchor in the tale of Blue Lunden, the subject of the first segment, ''Some Ground to Stand On.'' Ms. Lunden describes her hard introduction to gay life as a teenager in the 1950's, when her name made the newspaper after her visit to a New Orleans women's bar that was raided by the police.</p>
        <p>Using a mix of archival and contemporary material, the director, Joyce Warshow, documents the journey of this woman, who had precious little support in her struggles to live openly as a lesbian -- and as a mother, an employee and a citizen.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lunden succeeds in those struggles. The documentary shows her range of work for the antinuclear movement, the women's movement and other causes. A postscript notes that she died in 1999, after this documentary was completed. ''Some Ground to Stand On'' feels incomplete, but it asserts that while Ms. Lunden's death is a loss, the tale of her unpretentious heroism is the viewer's gain.</p>
