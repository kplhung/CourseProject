        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate in New York, violated insider trading laws when he made a nearly 600 percent profit in less than seven weeks by investing in securities of a company controlled by some of his biggest campaign contributors.</p>

        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate in New York, violated insider trading laws when he made a nearly 600 percent profit in less than seven weeks by investing in securities of a company controlled by some of his biggest campaign contributors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio released a statement last night saying that the commission had asked him for copies of ''account statements and trading records.'' He said he would provide all information requested and would answer any questions from the commission.</p>
        <p>''I reiterate today what I stated last week: that there is no incidence in my financial transactions that involve any improprieties,'' he said. ''I have repeatedly conducted myself, privately and publicly, with the highest degree of integrity and professionalism.''</p>
        <p>The commission's inquiry seems to be at a preliminary stage, and many such requests for information do not lead to charges. A commission spokesman, Chris Ullman, said, ''We can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, asserted that the commission was undertaking the investigation at the behest of the campaign of Mr. Lazio's Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mr. Dal Col said the Clinton administration had a history of ''abusing federal authority'' for political purposes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ullman, while emphasizing that he was not confirming that an investigation had begun, said: ''We're an independent regulatory agency. Any action we do or don't take is based on the merits.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dal Col questioned why word of the inquiry surfaced on the same day that the independent counsel, Robert W. Ray, announced that he had found substantial evidence that Mrs. Clinton had played a role in firings at the White House travel office, though he declined to file charges.</p>
        <p>Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, responded by saying that ''desperate campaigns make desperate charges.''</p>
        <p>The inquiry appears to have been opened by the commission's enforcement division, which is headed by Richard Walker, a lawyer who joined the panel in 1991. The commission is composed of five members appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. No more than three members can be from one political party.</p>
        <p>On Monday, one of Mrs. Clinton's staunchest supporters, H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, asked the commission to investigate Mr. Lazio, citing an article about Mr. Lazio's investments in The New York Times last Friday. But it appears that the commission began its inquiry before being contacted by Mr. McCall. Mr. Lazio's campaign said Lazio aides were contacted by the commission on Monday or Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said last week that he did not have inside information when he earned a profit of roughly $13,500 in 1997 from speculative options trades in the stock of the company, Quick &amp; Reilly, his first such options purchase. He said that he had merely made a wise bet and that he was a modest investor who had had mixed luck in the stock market.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has declined to release his brokerage records or tax returns, though his campaign says he will eventually release the tax records. He reported the outlines of the Quick &amp; Reilly trades on disclosure forms that he is required to file with the House of Representatives.</p>
        <p>Charles Salmans, a spokesman for Quick &amp; Reilly, which was an independent brokerage company before being acquired by the Fleet Financial Group, declined to comment on whether Quick &amp; Reilly executives had been contacted by the S.E.C.</p>
        <p>Two members of the Quick family who have been executives at the company, Peter and Christopher C. Quick, have said they did not discuss the firm's stock with Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Executives of Quick &amp; Reilly have been among Mr. Lazio's biggest supporters, having donated at least $35,000 to his Congressional campaigns.</p>
        <p>The largest contributor is a senior executive, Pascal J. Mercurio, who with his wife has given $7,750 to the campaigns. The Mercurios live in Mr. Lazio's district in Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>Reached by telephone last week, Mr. Mercurio hung up when asked about his relationship with Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio first bought Quick &amp; Reilly stock in early 1997 and then added more shares in June 1997, on the same day Quick &amp; Reilly hired an investment banker to seek buyers.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Aug., 1 of that year, Mr. Lazio bought options on Quick &amp; Reilly stock -- prompted, he now says, by rumors that the company might be a takeover target. On Monday, Aug. 4, in a transaction that Mr. Lazio acknowledged last week but had failed to report on his disclosure forms, he bought more options.</p>
        <p>He spent a total of $2,300 on the options, which are securities that allow an investor to buy shares at a specified price for a limited amount of time. If the price does not rise, the options become worthless.</p>
        <p>A week later, on Aug. 11, news leaked out that the company had hired investment bankers, and the prices of the stock and options jumped. The company was later acquired by Fleet Financial.</p>
        <p>A review of public information and trading records shows that speculation about Quick &amp; Reilly being a takeover target had just started to grow when Mr. Lazio made his first options purchase on Aug. 1.</p>
        <p>Total volume in options to buy Quick &amp; Reilly stock came to 1,500 contracts on Aug. 1, nearly triple the volume of the previous day, and 1,542 contracts the following Monday, according to figures from the Options Clearing Corporation, which overseas the settling of all options trades.</p>
        <p>Both figures represented just a quarter of the activity on Aug. 12, when volume soared after news of the potential takeover surfaced.</p>
