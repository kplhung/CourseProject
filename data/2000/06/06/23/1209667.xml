        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>U.A.W. STRIKES BACK OVER CHINA  The United Automobile Workers has retaliated against a longtime friend who defied the union and supported the China trade bill. Not only has the union decided against endorsing the longtime ally, Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, but it has thrown its support behind his Republican opponent, Bart Baron. The U.A.W. and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters persuaded the Michigan A.F.L.-C.I.O. to remain neutral, instead of supporting Mr. Levin. Some labor leaders are criticizing the union arguing that if a Republican is elected in the district, it will be harder for Democrats to regain control of Congress.</p>

        <p>THE CONVENTIONS</p>
        <p>AN ALTERNATIVE TO TWO PARTIES  A bipartisan coalition of advocacy groups and celebrities is planning an alternative to the Republican and Democratic national conventions in Philadelphia and Los Angeles this summer. The coalition said its ''shadow conventions'' would highlight three issues: the gap between rich and poor, campaign finance reform and the ''failed'' war on drugs. Among those sponsoring the event are Common Cause, Public Campaign and the syndicated columnist Arianna Huffington. Those participating will include Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona; the actors Warren Beatty and Ron Silver, the television talk show host Bill Maher and the comedian Al Franken. The group said the shadow conventions, to be broadcast on its Web site, www.shadowconventions.com., will last for three days.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>A WILLING RUNNING MATE  Most Democrats or Republicans feign modesty and decline to comment substantively if they win speculative mention as a possible vice-presidential choice. Not Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo. Asked yesterday on a trip to Israel whether he would agree to be Al Gore's running mate, if asked, he shot back in a New York second: Yes. Or, Mr. Cuomo went on, he might follow in the footsteps of his father, Mario, and run for governor of New York in 2002. Meanwhile, back in Minnesota, Mr. Gore was asked how the search was progressing for a running mate. ''Don't have a short list yet,'' he replied.</p>
