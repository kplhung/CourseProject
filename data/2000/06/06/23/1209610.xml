        <p>They stayed up past midnight chitchatting about ''everything under the sun.'' Their wives went horseback riding together. They chuckled at each other's jokes, took turns poking fun at reporters and even dressed alike, in chinos and polo shirts.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore visited a junior high school here today with Gov. Jesse Ventura, combining the earnestness of a policy forum with the forced joviality of a buddy movie, to promote a proposal to increase federal aid for special education. (Mr. Ventura's 16-year-old daughter, Jade, has a learning disability.)</p>
        <p>But the broader political point Mr. Gore seemed intent on hammering home was his growing closeness to Mr. Ventura, a former professional wrestler who won election on the Reform Party line in 1998 and remains a favorite of independent voters across the nation.</p>
        <p>''It's no secret that I'm reaching out to independents and independent-minded Republicans,'' Mr. Gore said at a joint news conference.</p>
        <p>Many polls suggest that Mr. Gore needs a boost with those unaffiliated voters. Two weeks ago, for instance, a Los Angeles Times survey showed him trailing his likely Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush, by 23 points among independents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has met three times with Mr. Ventura in the last four months, once to discuss campaign finance reform. Paradoxically, government officials said today that a Justice Department official had recommended an investigation of Mr. Gore's role in 1996 campaign fund-raising.</p>
        <p>In a joint appearance on NBC's ''Today'' show, Mr. Ventura described their budding friendship this way: ''I think the vice president looks at me more as a break, getting away from the rigors of the campaign trail.'' He added: ''We really don't talk that much on issues when we get together. We talk on other things. We tell old war stories. We, you know, enjoy the company of each other and have fun.''</p>
        <p>When asked if he would endorse Mr. Gore, Mr. Ventura said he would consider that a betrayal of the third party movement. But he added that if the vice president came up ''with a policy that I agree with, like the one on special ed, I will come out and endorse that policy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore jumped in, saying: ''I'm not working on his endorsement. I'm working on his vote.''</p>
        <p>The cheerful patter continued in a joint interview on MTV, where the famously stiff vice president said he had been trying to teach the famously bawdy governor how to loosen up, while the bald governor said he had given the balding vice president hair-styling tips.</p>
        <p>''I'm even thinking about a feather boa,'' Mr. Gore said, referring to one of Mr. Ventura's favorite accouterments as a wrestler.</p>
        <p>Later, in a joint news conference, Mr. Gore praised Mr. Ventura for bringing a ''spontaneous, freewheeling, candid style'' to governing. Moments later, as if on cue, Mr. Gore grabbed the cell phone that a CBS producer had just been talking on. ''This is the vice president,'' he said. ''Do you have a question?''</p>
        <p>The caller asked to speak to Mr. Ventura, so Mr. Gore passed the phone to him. Just then, a phone belonging to a CNN producer rang, and Mr. Gore answered it. ''Gore news conference,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In his visit to North Junior High School here, Mr. Gore said he would increase federal aid for special education to $1.5 billion in his first year in office, from $700 million. He also called for protecting a portion of the federal surplus each year to use exclusively on education, including money for expanding preschool programs and recruiting new teachers.</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. Gore flew to Denver to speak at two fund-raisers for the Democratic National Committee that raised a total of $1.1 million.</p>
