        <p>HERE'S a stretch: one of the more improbable pairings in recent exhibition history. It puts the work of Andy Warhol (1928-1987) with that of the Social Realist painter Robert Gwathmey (1903-1988), the idea being that the under-appreciated Gwathmey and the canonized Warhol shared an outlook as ''social commentators'' on American life.</p>
        <p>At the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, each is given a separate show, ''Robert Gwathmey: Master Painter'' and ''Andy Warhol: Social Observer.'' But each is meant to complement the other in this ill-conceived double feature. The Academy's aim in mounting the two together, it says, is nothing less than reshaping conceptions of postwar American art.</p>
        <p>Well, O.K. It's not a bad idea to reshape conceptions from time to time, and the pairing is certainly well intentioned. But it's more than a little on the silly side. Gwathmey's earnest, injustice-hating paintings about the hardscrabble lives of black sharecroppers in the rural South and his later meditations on the human condition are on a different wavelength from Warhol's campy infatuation with the sensations and celebrities of the media-saturated American scene. Moreover, although only a generation apart in age, he and Warhol had totally different notions of the premises of art.</p>
        <p>True, Warhol caught the meretriciousness of late 20th-century life, and his repetitive paintings of dollar signs, for instance, could be construed as an indictment of our society's prime priority. But in Warhol -- nevertheless a far more complex and interesting artist than Gwathmey -- there is more cynical acceptance than social criticism.</p>
        <p>Although Gwathmey's work, like that of his better-known colleagues Philip Evergood, Jacob Lawrence and Ben Shahn, found a ready audience in the protest era and aftermath of the Great Depression -- the 30's, 40's and 50's -- it fell out of fashion when the doctrine of art for art's sake came in. Social protest, too, ran low on fuel as the United States surmounted the Depression. The reformist 60's saw some renewal of interest in Gwathmey, but from 1972 to the late 90's, no museum show was held. Trying to introduce Gwathmey to a new generation, the Butler Institute of American Art in Youngstown, Ohio, has organized this touring survey of his work, including more than 60 oils, drawings and watercolors, now making its final stop.</p>
        <p>Gwathmey, an eighth-generation white Virginian, grew up in modest circumstances in Richmond. As a child, his visits to relatives in the Tidewater countryside acquainted him with the struggles of rural black people. Their striving, which had its full impact on the artist only years later, became a major theme of his spare, highly stylized paintings, works that deal with the rigors of sharecropping and racial inequities, but also -- more positively -- with the flavor of black family life.</p>
        <p>His work developed, it's worth noting, at the same time and with similar content as that of photographers like Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange and Marion Post Wolcott, who worked for the federal government's Farm Security Administration documenting American life during the Depression. Gwathmey himself often took inspiration from photographs of sharecroppers and tenant farmers  by his wife, Rosalie, also a Southerner.</p>
        <p>A graduate of the Pennsylvania Academy and then for years a teacher -- including a long stint at the Cooper Union in New York City -- Gwathmey was an innovative colorist and a clever designer of pictorial space. His primary influences were Picasso and Cubism, from which he learned respect for the flat, two-dimensional canvas surface. A less felicitous source of imagery was medieval stained glass windows, which inspired the bold linearities that define Gwathmey's forms and give his compositions an overly schematized, at times even cartoonish, look. His figures, as in the unusually lighthearted beach scene ''Winter's Playground'' (1947), more than occasionally suggest the anatomical dummies used in art classes.</p>
        <p>His subjects, too, while often moving and tender, like ''Children Dancing'' (1948), a view of mother, father and children in a sweet family celebration, can be sentimental and derivative, like ''The Ballad Singer'' (1939-40), a Picassoid study of a black guitarist, mouth open in song. Set within a geometric space, the singer's presence is asserted -- and assaulted -- by the heavy lines that accentuate his body.</p>
        <p>Some of Gwathmey's most effective work deals with contrasts between his have-not subjects and their materialistic surroundings. In ''The Hitchhiker'' (circa 1936), one of his earliest surviving paintings, the figure of a man presumably in search of work thumbing a ride is backed by an array of billboards advertising out-of-reach consumer goods. The more satirical ''Poll Tax Country'' (1945) pits a posturing group of white Southern racists against a crowd of black laborers. As a pompous speaker exhorts the laborers, they go unheedingly about their chores. A black bird, Gwathmey's ubiquitous symbol for Jim Crow, is perched above the speaker.</p>
        <p>Gwathmey, who was under surveillance by the F.B.I. from 1942 to 1969 because of left-wing sympathies, took up other subjects in his later years, like the horrors of war, exemplified in ''Homo Sapiens, Late Twentieth Century'' (1973). In it two battling figures struggle while a solar eclipse goes on above. The barren ground they fight on is a horrific no man's land. But Gwathmey was more at home exploring his native turf than wallowing in apocalypse, and paintings like these are not the works to remember him by. If he was not a great artist, he was certainly a committed one.</p>
        <p>The Warhol show, organized by Jonathan P. Binstock, assistant curator at the museum, is a bigger one, with more than 80 paintings, photographs, prints and a film ranging over the artist's entire career. This reprise is arranged in seven sections that include death and disaster, politics, celebrities, advertising and symbolism. On view, yet again, are famous icons like his ''Self Portrait'' (1986), the artist as a mystery guru with feathers jutting from his head and amorphous abstractions playing across his face; the repetitive close-ups of Jacqueline Kennedy taken at the time of the president's assassination in 1963, the four-image ''Electric Chair'' series and ''Race Riot'' (both 1964), the screenprints of Mao and Nixon (the latter is titled ''Vote McGovern'') from 1972, and so on.</p>
        <p>The attempt is to show that the artist's famous facade of blandness and disengagement from social issues was a giant miscue; that the chosen seven themes characterized his involvement ''with what he perceived as socially relevant issues in art and life,'' Mr. Binstock writes in his catalog essay. To make this exhibition a tad more relevant to the Gwathmey show, a photograph of an early Gwathmey work, ''Street Scene'' (1938), is included in the Warhol catalog, which notes that a 1970 monograph by the art historian Rainer Crone described Warhol as  ''socially conscious, politically motivated, and heir to the tradition of American social realists such as Ben Shahn and Robert Gwathmey.'' But by Gwathmey's standards, Warhol had the social conscience of a grasshopper.</p>
        <p>Mr. Binstock's shilly-shallying arguments are unconvincing. He himself admits in his essay that Warhol leaves us with feelings of ambivalence. ''In the end, Warhol did care about people, politics and current events,'' he writes, ''and from time to time he did choose sides. But it is also fair to conclude that he probably would have preferred not to.''</p>
