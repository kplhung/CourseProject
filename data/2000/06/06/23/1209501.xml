        <p>The deal was this: periodically the actors would vote on whether to let the filmmakers back into rehearsals; if the vote was no, the film would be burned.

        <p>The deal was this: periodically the actors would vote on whether to let the filmmakers back into rehearsals; if the vote was no, the film would be burned. Under that not altogether comfortable set of conditions, D. A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus began work on ''Moon Over Broadway,'' their acclaimed documentary about the putting together of the 1995 play ''Moon Over Buffalo.''</p>
        <p>When Docurama releases the film on tape and DVD on July 5, there should be none of the unsettling elements that surrounded either the documentary or the making of the troubled Broadway comedy, which starred Carol Burnett and Philip Bosco. Noted for a cinema-verite approach that allows the camera to observe but never intrude, Pennebaker documentaries have famously watched show-business scenes unfolding. For this assignment he and Ms. Hegedus appeared with their cameras at the start of rehearsals.</p>
        <p>''You can't take anything for granted,'' Mr. Pennebaker said the other day. ''You're going into private areas of people's lives.'' Ms. Burnett had not been on Broadway in 30 years. ''No matter how engaging they might be initially when they shake hands and tell you how much they like your films,'' Mr. Pennebaker continued, ''when you start to poke around, you aren't sure how they're going to take it.''</p>
        <p>On the disc, a number of particiants -- Mr. Bosco; Tom Moore, the play's director; Ken Ludwig, the playwright; and Rocco Landesman, one of the producers -- indicate that they took the documentary makers' presence well enough to join in the director's commentary several years later. Ms. Burnett's reflections, recorded separately, are stirred in.</p>
        <p>During rehearsals they spoke their minds, and they do so again on the disc, which is one reason DVD commentaries can be fun and instructive even if they are about an old Broadway show that had its problems from the start but lasted 9 months and 301 performances.</p>
        <p>In the commentary, Mr. Bosco is as critical of the play as he was during rehearsals, when he reacted angrily to what he perceived as the director's and the playwright's attempts to stifle the actors' interpretations of their roles. Mr. Bosco initially joined the project because he thought the comedy, about the farcical troubles of a flamboyant and once-renowned older theatrical couple, had been written for him.</p>
        <p>In fact, it had been, but other elements crept in -- Hollywood, he says, by which he means the necessity in the end to create a star vehicle. But he joins the others in lauding Ms. Burnett, who worked hard to adjust from her years in television.</p>
        <p>The real hero of the documentary is Mr. Ludwig. ''Time and 'Moon Over Buffalo' have also reinforced my long-held suspicion that Ms. Burnett can locate a laugh in an empty laundry hamper,'' Vincent Canby wrote in his review in The New York Times, a not exactly rave referral to the play's humor. The playwright, rewriting like mad all through the rehearsal process, , takes criticism in stride.</p>
        <p>''If I met them all at the same birthday party, they wouldn't be a happy group,'' Mr. Pennebaker said. ''I liked them all individually because I see the terrible ordeal they go through.''</p>
        <p>New Video Releases: Liberty Heights</p>
        <p>Barry Levinson's fourth Baltimore-based film chronicles the rise of 50's television, rock 'n' roll and the teenage car culture. Avoiding ''Happy Days'' stereotypes is no mean trick, but here is a fresh perspective from two young brothers (Ben Foster, above, and Adrien Brody) growing up in a middle-class Jewish family in a gentile-dominated world. Luckily they have solid, caring parents (Joe Mantegna and Bebe Neuwirth). The director, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, ''shows a special knack for capturing the boastful, clinging camaraderie and cultural fetishes of innocents trying to invent themselves in a more restrictive era.''</p>
        <p>1999. Warner. $107.37; DVD, $24.98. 127 minutes. Closed captioned. R.</p>
        <p>Beautiful People</p>
        <p>In a London hospital after a brawl with a Serb, a Croat winds up in the bed next to his opponent, and they fall to arguing over who started it all. Jan Dizdar's film follows an agglomeration of Balkan characters and others around the multicultural city, trying to find some sense in a situation that has none. But his movie, crammed with disparate stories, is anything but grim. Mr. Dizdar ''directs with extraordinary exuberance and self-confidence, in a style that combines documentary realism with a playful, improvisatory sense of possibility'' (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>1999. Trimark. $69.99; DVD, $24.99. 117 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date June 27.</p>
        <p>Leila</p>
        <p>Learning that her daughter-in-law, Leila (Leila Hatami), is infertile, an imperious mother-in-law (Jamileh Sheikhi) systematically undermines the marriage of her only son (Ali Mosaffa). Dariush Mehrjui's heartbreaking film is set in Iran, but the parents' selfishness and pride put her in the same elite league with some of Hollywood's most formidable Gorgons.</p>
        <p>Born to wealth and privilege, Leila is thrown by the relentless campaign to have her husband take a second wife who can bear him a son.</p>
        <p>While he remains devoted, She gradually falls apart in a film that ''is, in a word, devastating'' (Holden).</p>
        <p>1999. First Run Features. $79.95; DVD, $29.95. 129 minutes. Farsi with English subtitles. No rating.</p>
        <p>Gun Shy</p>
        <p>''You need to share more than anyone I've ever known,'' an undercover Fed named Charlie Mayo (Liam Neeson) is told by his psychiatrist (Michael Mantell).</p>
        <p>During an operation Charlie was caught and tortured face down in a pile of watermelon and ever since he has been looking for his lost nerve. His new assignment lands him between a yuppie Colombian thug (Jose Zuniga) and a violent cohort, Fulvio (Oliver Platt).</p>
        <p>Charlie's stomach growls like a Rottweiler, but comfort comes from a nurse named Judy (Sandra Bullock) in ''one of the most subtle and inspired comedies you'll see this year'' (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>2000. Hollywood. $104.16; DVD, $29.99. 102 minutes. R. Closed captioned.</p>
        <p>Straight to Video</p>
        <p>Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in earlier editions.</p>
        <p>TOO JEWISH? Avi Hoffman's delightful musical revue does its best to keep Yiddish and Yiddish theater alive, evoking the past when it flourished from the shtetls of Eastern Europe to the Bronx. ''A warm and winning mixture of nostalgia, song, comedy and cultural and social history,'' Lawrence Van Gelder wrote in The New York Times. 1995. Ergo Media. $29.95. 100 minutes. Information: (800) 695-3746.</p>
        <p>FREEDOM SONG. Keeping sentimentality largely at bay, Phil Alden Robinson's film recounts a time of mounting racial violence in the South in the early 1960's. A disillusioned idealist (Danny Glover) tries to deal with his angry son (Vicellous Reon Shannon), who allies himself with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee as tensions lead to murder, demonstrations, beatings and jailings. Mr. Robinson, William McDonald wrote in The New York Times, ''has avoided falling into the trap of peopling his microcosm with representative types.''</p>
        <p>DRUNKEN ANGEL; I LIVE IN FEAR. Two films by Akira Kurosawa are available for the first time. In ''Drunken Angel'' (1948, 102 minutes), with Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura, a gangster with tuberculosis and a bullet lodged in his hand relates to the alcoholic doctor who treats him. In ''I Live in Fear'' (1955, 105 minutes), an aging foundry owner (Mifune) terrified of nuclear conflict, moves to Brazil. Home Vision. $19.99 each. Japanese with English subtitles.</p>
