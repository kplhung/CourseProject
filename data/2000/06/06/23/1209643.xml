        <p>Re ''George Bush's 60's Were Real, Too'' (Op-Ed, June 22):</p>
        <p>David Frum misses the point of the recent coverage of George W. Bush's lack of campus activism at Yale. As president of the Yale Political Union in 1994, I came into contact with visiting 1960's alumni of the organization who, like Mr. Bush, were not campus radicals. But unlike Mr. Bush, they were full participants in the debates of that era. What is surprising about Mr. Bush, given the fact that he is now a leading politician, is not that he wasn't a Yippie; it's that he wasn't even your average politically aware Yalie.</p>

        <p>If, as Mr. Frum argues, the radicals had not really emerged yet at Yale in 1968, then why did Mr. Bush not follow the lead of William F. Buckley Jr., who had begun his crusade against liberalism in New Haven 20 years earlier? The answer seems to be that Mr. Bush was too busy branding freshmen at his fraternity house.</p>
