        <p>Saying that Europe was poised between ''hope and fear'' over the future of democracy in Belarus, a delegation from the European Parliament today severely criticized President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko's assault on his political opponents and threatened to withhold a team of observers for elections he is trying to orchestrate for the fall.</p>
        <p>The election struggle puts the country of 10 million wedged between Russia and Poland at a crucial junction. Mr. Lukashenko is seeking to restore the legitimacy of his hard-line nationalist government after he disbanded a democratically elected Parliament in 1996, installed his own rump Parliament and extended his presidential term to 2001 in a referendum widely condemned as rigged.</p>
        <p>The opposition, which includes many leading figures who helped separate Belarus from the Soviet Union in 1991 and establish an independent state, is simply trying to eject Mr. Lukashenko from office by forcing him to submit to a fair election, which they say he will lose. And if he refuses to conduct such an election, a number of opposition leaders say, they will carry on the battle as best they can, even in the streets, where some warned that a confrontation was looming.</p>
        <p>Mikhail N. Chigir, who was Mr. Lukashenko's first prime minister and who broke with him over the 1996 dissolution of Parliament, said today that he intended to run for Parliament this fall and for president next spring if Mr. Lukashenko would allow genuine elections.</p>
        <p>''I am going to continue this struggle, and I have no intention of stopping halfway,'' he said in an interview, after enduring eight months of imprisonment and a political trial that left him stripped of any right to run for office. He hopes that decision can be reversed by pressure from Russia, Europe and the United States.</p>
        <p>Twice this spring, tens of thousands of antigovernment demonstrators took to the streets here to protest Mr. Lukashenko's authoritarian rule. Thousands of riot police broke up the largest of the rallies on March 25, arresting and beating hundreds of protesters, including dozens of journalists who were covering the peaceful march.</p>
        <p>''The goal is Lukashenko himself,'' said Pavel Zhuk, an independent newspaper editor whose publishing enterprises have twice been shut down. ''I don't think it will end quietly,'' he said. ''The pressure just keeps getting higher and higher. Something is going to happen. There will be an explosion.''</p>
        <p>Today's rebuke from the visiting Europeans, who have been trying to urge Mr. Lukashenko into talks with the opposition to guarantee fair elections, comes as both the United States and Russian leaders are stepping up their pressure on Mr. Lukashenko. They also want him to come to terms with opposition forces and to allay the climate of fear that critics say has smothered the nascent democratic institutions that brought Mr. Lukashenko to power in 1994. His presidential term ended in July 1999, and many Western countries, including the United States, have downgraded their official contacts with his government.</p>
        <p>In Washington, the House of Representatives last month passed a nonbinding resolution condemning human rights violations and the suppression of democracy in Belarus. A number of members of Congress are urging Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright to meet with Belarussian opposition leaders at a conference on democracy in Poland next week. In Moscow, three prominent political figures, including former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and the Yabloko Party's leader, Grigory Yavlinsky, signed an appeal to Mr. Lukashenko this week to liberalize the election process by allowing opposition access to state-controlled news media and to election oversight. So  far Mr. Lukashenko has refused both. He declined requests for an interview.</p>
        <p>Instead of responding to his critics, Mr. Lukashenko flew to Moscow this week to meet President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the other leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States in their first summit meeting since Mr. Putin's election in March. In the Russian capital -- where last December Mr. Lukashenko signed a treaty of union between Russia and Belarus to merge the two countries' currencies and foster military coordination in a crisis -- the Belarussian leader indulged in his favorite sport of baiting NATO and the West, which he said feared a ''strong competitor'' on the territory of the former Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>For that reason, he said, ''Belarus will do all it can to speed up integration with Russia rather than slow down.''</p>
        <p>''Belarus,'' he said, ''will not turn away from our Russia -- there is no other great nation in the world -- I mean the Soviet entity.''</p>
