        <p>Vivendi S.A., the French conglomerate that is buying the Seagram Corporation, said yesterday that it planned to make no significant changes in top management at Seagram's Universal film and television operations.</p>
        <p>Although there had been speculation that Ron Meyer, the president of Universal Studios, would leave his post, Pierre Lescure, the chairman of Canal Plus, the French pay television company that Vivendi has a large stake in and plans to fully own, said he was intent on keeping Mr. Meyer and his top executives. Mr. Lescure will be in charge of the combined company's film units.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meyer has 5 years left on a 10-year contract, and if Hollywood settlements are any indication, it would cost Vivendi millions of dollars to terminate it early. Mr. Meyer declined to comment.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview yesterday from Italy, where he was traveling on business, Mr. Lescure said that he knew Mr. Meyer and thought highly of him. He said the two had spoken by phone yesterday and that Mr. Meyer would travel to Paris next week for meetings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lescure also spoke highly of Stacey Snider, the chairwoman of Universal Pictures. ''I have heard a lot about her, and she has the way to become a kind of Sherry Lansing,'' Mr. Lescure said, referring to the chairwoman of Paramount Pictures, who is widely respected in the industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lescure said he expected to visit Los Angeles, where the studio is based, after the Fourth of July weekend, and would eventually spend about a quarter of his time there.</p>
        <p>Universal Pictures, which has had some difficult years, has done well recently with hits like ''Gladiator,'' a joint venture with DreamWorks, and ''Erin Brockovich,'' with each of them taking in more than $100 million at the box office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lescure was quick to say that he is ''10,000 kilometers from the Universal lot, so it would be ridiculous and pretentious to say that I know what is going on there.''</p>
        <p>After Vivendi's acquisition of Seagram, it will control 43 percent of USA Networks Inc. USA Network's chairman, Barry Diller, will not report to Mr. Lescure. But Mr. Lescure made it clear that he had high regard for ''one of the top American executives.''</p>
        <p>''He is the main asset of the TV business in this company,'' Mr. Lescure said, adding, ''and I am the one in this company who knows a lot about TV.''</p>
        <p>''He needs shareholders who trust him,'' Mr. Lescure said, a seeming indication that Mr. Diller would receive support to expand his company. There have been reports that Seagram, which could veto any USA Networks deal that represents an investment larger than 10 percent of USA Network's market value, had opposed Mr. Diller's bid for NBC. That move move reportedly created tension between Edgar Bronfman Jr., the chief executive of Seagram, and Mr. Diller.</p>
