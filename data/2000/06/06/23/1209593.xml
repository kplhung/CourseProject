        <p>There is intense concern (nay, even agita, if such an unrefined state were considered acceptable) in certain lofty altitudes of Manhattan's Upper East Side.

        <p>There is intense concern (nay, even agita, if such an unrefined state were considered acceptable) in certain lofty altitudes of Manhattan's Upper East Side. The Carlyle Hotel is for sale, and the seriously soigne are worried that this oasis of sophistication -- the preserve of presidents, prime ministers and popular legends -- will fall into, well, the wrong hands.</p>
        <p>''So many guests come up to me and say, 'I hope they don't change things,' '' said Ronald Hector, standing behind the reception desk in his role as executive assistant manager. ''They all know about the sale, and they are all worried.''</p>
        <p>Annexation by a boorish newcomer ''would be such a shame,'' said Brooke Astor, the 98-year-old society cynosure who celebrated her 95th birthday at the Carlyle. ''I would feel so sad if it were no more.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, it would be ''terrible'' if the Carlyle were sold ''to anyone who didn't respect its inherent characteristics,'' said Woody Allen, the filmmaker and sometime Carlyle guest who has played jazz clarinet in the Cafe Carlyle nearly every Monday night for two years. ''There are certain things that are just better left alone, and the Carlyle is one of them.''</p>
        <p>The 70-year-old hotel at 35 East 76th Street has long been a palace of secrets, well before it became the New York White House for President John F. Kennedy, who made it a fulcrum of world, and possibly other, affairs. It is the grand residence where Diana, Princess of Wales, discreetly stayed whenever she visited New York, and it is the establishment where John F. Kennedy Jr. last ate breakfast before his plane crashed.</p>
        <p>In true Carlylish tradition, the parties to the sale have been exquisitely private about hawking the property, and few reliable details have leaked about the complex negotiations that have now dragged on for more than a year. In an interview, Norman L. Peck, the managing partner of the Carlyle, who heads its ownership group, insisted that he would not think of permitting an unqualified suitor to buy ''this very high-bred animal.''</p>
        <p>The sale comes as the occupancy rate in the city's 60,000 hotel rooms is the highest in 20 years: 89.1 percent in April, according to estimates by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm.</p>
        <p>''There are times of the year, and days of the week, when hotels could charge virtually anything they want because the city is so tight,'' said Arthur Adler, a managing director for Jones Lang LaSalle Hotels, a real estate brokerage firm that is not involved in the deal.</p>
        <p>Average room rates citywide are $245.27, 11.7 percent higher than a year before, but hardly in a league with the Carlyle. Its cushy, and much-becushioned, antique-rich rooms go for $425 to $695 per night for a single; suites range from $650 to $3,250.</p>
        <p>And although more than 3,000 new hotel rooms are opening in Manhattan this year (potentially creating a room glut at midrange establishments), ''the New York hotel market at the luxury and ultraluxury level is on fire,'' said Brendan P. Sullivan, president of InterBank/Brener Hospitality, a hotel advisory company that is not involved in the deal.</p>
        <p>Brad Grey, the Hollywood producer of ''The Sopranos'' and ''Politically Incorrect,'' who has been a Carlyle regular for nearly 20 years, hopes the torrid hotel market will not consume his home away from home. ''One would hope that they would find a buyer who will respect the character of the Carlyle and the level of service,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The savior, however, will not be Mrs. Astor, who sold off the St. Regis Hotel after her husband, Vincent, died. ''I'm afraid I'm not going to bid on it,'' she said of the Carlyle, adding, with a laugh: ''I'm not going to start doing that again.''</p>
        <p>Concern among Carlyle acolytes runs high, since ''practically everyone in the neighborhood on Park Avenue or Fifth who was ever getting divorced or separated has stayed here,'' Mr. Peck said. ''They've stayed at the Carlyle during their renovations -- not to mention their wedding nights!''</p>
        <p>In the annals of urbanity, the opulent Carlyle is perhaps best known to non-10021ers for the presence of Bobby Short, the high-end saloon singer who has served up Cole Porter and George Gershwin at the Cafe Carlyle since 1968.</p>
        <p>But habitues say they adore the state-of-the-art cosseting by the work force of 437. Above and beyond the staff's paparazzi protection, ''there seems to be a cone of privacy around celebrities at the hotel,'' said Charles Dean, a restaurant captain and the assistant maitre d'hotel. Discretion is so cherished that soon after the breakup of the Beatles, two of the Fab Four were guests in the hotel in different suites at the same time but did not realize it until after they had left, according to employees who were there. Even now, they will not say which Beatles they were.</p>
        <p>Other patrons have included Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and every American president back to Harry S. Truman, who was famous for galloping out of the hotel on his morning constitutionals, ''forcing the reporters to run after him into the park,'' said Michael O'Connell, 69, the bell captain, who witnessed it with glee.</p>
        <p>During his presidency, Kennedy regularly visited the Carlyle, and his suite was never rented to another guest until the staff first checked with him. Carlylers still debate the details of ''the whole Jack Kennedy myth, you know, did Marilyn Monroe get smuggled in with the meat?'' said Mr. Peck, asking, but not answering, the question.</p>
        <p>If the Carlyle's aura of intimate civility has not yet proved popular among nouveau-riche dot-commoners, the devoted Hollywood contingent includes Jack Nicholson, Robin Williams, Warren Beatty and Annette Bening.</p>
        <p>More than a few upper-crust guests have been smuggled into the hotel through the inelegant garage elevator. Diana, dodging hordes of paparazzi one afternoon, made her Carlyle escort laugh by giving the elevator a very long look, then saying, ''You've certainly rolled out the red carpet for me.''</p>
        <p>The intention to sell the Carlyle was announced in March 1999 by the hotel's managing partner at the time, Jerome L. Greene, the 93-year-old lawyer, real estate investor and benefactor who was an underwriter of the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center. Mr. Greene had bought the hotel in 1967 for $15.5 million with Mr. Peck and Peter Jay Sharp, the hotelier and real estate developer whose family owned the Stanhope Hotel.</p>
        <p>By all accounts, the partners enjoyed one another's company, and drew up a survivorship agreement, passing the hotel to living owners. When Mr. Sharp died in 1992, Mr. Greene, as the majority partner, inherited control; last year, he put the Carlyle up for sale.</p>
        <p>Only two months later, on May 27, 1999, Mr. Greene died in his suite at the hotel, and ownership was transferred in a manner that was totally Carlyle. Dan Camp, the hotel's managing director, paid his respects to Mr. Greene's family in the suite, then walked to Mr. Peck's Manhattan apartment near the hotel with the sad news. ''It was like a royal succession, and Dan came with the crown and said that I was the new managing partner,'' Mr. Peck said.</p>
        <p>For all his soft-spoken gentility, the 64-year-old Mr. Peck has survived four decades as a player in the cut-and-thrust of Gotham's real estate wars. He halted the sale process, reformulated the prospectus, and resumed the bidding on Sept. 9. ''If it was just up to me, I'm not sure I'd sell this hotel; it's a unique asset,'' Mr. Peck said. ''But the Sharp and Greene estates have to be liquidated. That is the reality.''</p>
        <p>The Carlyle prospectus was sent to a select coven of several dozen potential buyers ''because we didn't want to see a hotel like this involved in a marketing process like a common commercial property,'' said the Carlyle's broker, Benjamin V. Lambert of Eastdil Realty in Manhattan. But word spread, and soon more than 50 bidders were clamoring to kick the tires.</p>
        <p>The intense secrecy imposed by the Carlyle has forced the customarily gab-happy real estate clan to clutch at gossipy straws; parties to the negotiations have refused to name names. In December, a tabloid newspaper reported that the Carlyle was to be bought by the Sultan of Brunei for $150 million, but several parties close to the deal emphatically deny this, including Mr. Peck, who said that ''the Sultan of Brunei was never in the picture.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Camp put it: ''It will take a lot more than money to buy the Carlyle.''</p>
        <p>The Carlyle did have a near-buyer (nonroyal) in December, until the deal fell through.</p>
        <p>It is likely that the Carlyle will be sold as a trophy property to ''a strong foreign hotel company that is looking to enhance its visibility throughout the world,'' said Sean Hennessey, director of the hotel consulting business of PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p>
        <p>Hotel and real estate executives, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said that a serious suitor, until it was trumped by a higher bid, was Orient-Express Hotels, based in London. A company spokesman would not comment.</p>
        <p>Several executives with knowledge of the Carlyle negotiations say there is, as yet, no deal. Aside from trophy bidders, there are believed to be foreign investors seeking a safe place to park their money. A potential buyer could also be a wealthy individual not unlike Ty Warner, the inventor of Beanie Babies, who bought the Four Seasons Hotel on East 57th Street and Madison Avenue in 1999 for $275 million. This was about $750,000 per ''key,'' or residence unit, the record sale price for a Manhattan hotel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peck confirmed speculation among hotel executives that two groups are now competing for the Carlyle, and added that the hotel hoped to have a deal ''in 60 days.''</p>
        <p>But ''if it were an easy deal, it would have been done by now,'' said Mr. Adler, who added that a sticking point has involved the hotel's unusual ownership structure.</p>
        <p>The exterior-landmarked Carlyle is actually a cooperative, consisting of 180 hotel rental units plus 68 residential suites that are privately held. Potential owners must buy controlling shares in the cooperative rather than directly purchasing the buildings and land.</p>
        <p>Despite this eccentric setup, the Carlyle could command at least $100 million (or more than $500,000 a ''key'') thanks to its location, history, devoted clientele and the value of its retail space. ''It will command a very high price -- how high that is, is yet to be determined,'' said John A. Fox, a senior vice president of PKF Consulting, a hospitality specialist. He represents a potential buyer that he refused to name.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peck said softly, but flatly, that ''this house will not sell for less than the Four Seasons,'' referring to the ''key cost'' of $750,000 per suite, placing the asking price in the $130 million range.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the sale is a preoccupation of both staff and patrons.</p>
        <p>''I don't like the idea of it, and the guests tell me they don't, either,'' said Mr. O'Connell, the bell captain, who has worked at the Carlyle for 50 years and has vivid memories of Caroline and John-John Kennedy playing among the 18th-century mirrors and Gobelins tapestries in the lobby, when they lived upstairs in a suite with their mother for the year after their father's assassination.</p>
        <p>''I'll stay here,'' Mr. O'Connell said definitively, ''as long as things don't change.''</p>
