        <p>President Clinton has sought to boost the political fortunes of his wife and his vice president by condemning Republican tax cut proposals -- the ''Bush-Lazio tax plan,'' in his words -- as dangerous to the country's prosperity.</p>
        <p>At a fund-raiser in Washington on Wednesday night that raised $200,000 for Hillary Rodham Clinton's bid for a Senate seat from New York, Mr. Clinton lashed out at Representative Rick A. Lazio for the first time since he replaced New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani on the Republican side of the race for the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has yet to endorse Texas Gov. George W. Bush's proposed tax cut. ''The first casualty of any Clinton campaign has historically been the truth,'' said Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>The president said he was confident his wife would, in time, overcome questions from critics about why she was running for office in New York. He portrayed her pursuit of the Senate seat as a sacrifice -- a decision to put public service ahead of getting ''real rich'' after life in the White House.</p>
        <p>''For 30 years, she's worked for me and worked on the side. The whole time we were in Arkansas, she gave away lots of potential income every year just to do public service, because it's what she wanted to do,'' he said. ''And I can just tell you that in a lot of ways, she's better than I am on a lot of this stuff, and she knows things I don't know.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said he was amused that Republicans have circulated statements he has made praising Mr. Lazio for supporting various legislation.</p>
        <p>''It was a gas that he would try to give the people of New York the impression that I'd prefer him to my wife in the Senate,'' Mr. Clinton said, ''because she would have voted for my economic plan, not against it. And she would have voted against the contract on America, not for it. She wouldn't vote to shut the government down and get rid of the Department of Education, or get rid of the 100,000 police that lowered the crime rate in New York and other places.''</p>
        <p>Even as he jabbed at Mr. Lazio, the president made the case that Mrs. Clinton's Senate race and Vice President Al Gore's bid for the presidency should be decided on issues, not attacks.</p>
        <p>''It's no longer necessary to have one of these sort of mudslinging campaigns where everybody tries to convince everybody else that their opponent is just one step above a car thief,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said Republican proposals to grant large tax cuts would go so far that they would endanger the economy.</p>
        <p>''I believe if you have a Bush-Lazio tax plan, and it passed, you'd all be better off the day after because all of you can afford to come here today,'' Mr. Clinton told the 25 donors gathered at a Georgetown home for seafood canneloni, veal medallions and lemon souffle. ''But you wouldn't be better off if it led to an increase in interest rates. In two years, the impact it would have on the markets, on the overall economy, on the unemployment rate: you'd be worse off. And the overall economy would be worse off, and we wouldn't have the money to do things.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, who made a fund-raising trip yesterday that took him from Washington to Phoenix to San Diego, said the outcome of the presidential election, and the Senate race in New York State, would hinge on whether voters realized how much was at stake.</p>
        <p>''People ask me all the time, 'Well, who's going to win?' '' Mr. Clinton said. '' 'Do you think the vice president is going to win?' I say yes. 'Do you think Hillary is going to win?' I say yes. And I do -- on both counts. 'Do you think the Democrats will win back the Congress?' Of course, I say, yes. But here's the real truth -- who will win this election depends upon, more than anything else, what the people of America think the election is about. The question you ask may determine the answer you get.''</p>
        <p>That question, Mr. Clinton said, ought to be: Who is best suited to keep the prosperity going?</p>
