        <p>BIG changes are coming to the small but intensely competitive world of agencies that specialize in creating theatrical advertising.</p>
        <p>G-Whiz Entertainment in New York, a unit of the Grey Global Group, is getting out of the business of producing campaigns for Broadway and Off Broadway shows to concentrate on larger assignments in entertainment marketing. And Wilner Advertising in New York, a Broadway show specialist, is closing.</p>
        <p>The changes come as efforts to sell tickets to live theater grow in complexity and scope as it becomes increasingly challenging to gain the attention of consumers in an environment saturated with entertainment options that range from new reality series on television to a glitzed-up revival of professional wrestling to so-called extreme sports.</p>
        <p>''The theater business itself has never been better, but it's very labor intensive,'' said Nancy Coyne, chairwoman at Serino Coyne Inc. in New York, which handles shows like ''Aida,'' ''Beauty and the Beast,'' ''Cats,'' ''Footloose,'' ''Kiss Me, Kate'' and ''The Lion King.''</p>
        <p>''It's hard to make a go of it unless you have a lot of clients,'' she added. ''With one or two, it's hard to do.''</p>
        <p>G-Whiz Entertainment is forming an alliance with the Eliran Murphy Group in New York, which specializes in theatrical advertising, to serve the needs of producers of plays and musicals whose accounts had been handled by G-Whiz Entertainment. Those billings were estimated at $3.5 million out of a total of $110 million.</p>
        <p>''The formation of G-Whiz Entertainment resulted in a change in our mission,'' said Barbara Martino, president and chief executive. Her reference was to a move made in February by Grey Global, formerly Grey Advertising, to merge two specialty units.</p>
        <p>That merger brought together G-Whiz, founded in July 1999, which focused on marketing to children and teenagers, with Grey Entertainment, founded in 1974, which focused on traditional entertainment campaigns like the promotion of shows on and off Broadway as well as films. Ms. Martino had been president at G-Whiz before the merger that produced G-Whiz Entertainment.</p>
        <p>''The entertainment slant is becoming more of a youth-marketing slant,'' Ms. Martino said. ''The Broadway effort pretty much did not fit under where we were headed.''</p>
        <p>The shift in emphasis, she added, would benefit the youth-focused clients of G-Whiz Entertainment like Aeropostale, a retailer of apparel aimed at teenagers; Delsner/Slater, concert promoters; SFX Entertainment; the Warner Brothers unit of Time Warner; and Youtopia.com, a Web site focused on teenagers.</p>
        <p>Eliran Murphy, an agency with 27 employees handling accounts with billings estimated at $25 million, will assume the theatrical accounts now handled by G-Whiz Entertainment, assuming of course that clients agree to the switch. The shows affected include the current production of the long-running revue ''Forbidden Broadway,'' called ''Forbidden Broadway Cleans Up Its Act''; ''Late Night Catechism''; the coming production of ''Little Women''; and ''Tony 'n Tina's Wedding.''</p>
        <p>''We're hopeful they're interested in working with us,'' said Barbara Eliran, chief executive at Eliran Murphy. Ann Murphy, the president and creative director, described the alliance as ''a referral'' of the clients to Eliran Murphy.</p>
        <p>The 10 employees at G-Whiz Entertainment who work on theatrical advertising, out of a total of about 110, are to be interviewed for positions at Eliran Murphy, which now works for productions that include ''A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' ''Cabaret,'' ''Dame Edna,'' ''Dinner with Friends'' and ''I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change'' as well as the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Manhattan Theater Club, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the New York City Opera and the Roundabout Theater Company.</p>
        <p>Turning to Wilner, its closing was described yesterday in interviews with several top executives at other theatrical agencies. Telephone calls to Jon Wilner, president, were not returned.</p>
        <p>Last fall, Mr. Wilner said he was owed more than $500,000 by Livent Inc., the producer of the musical ''Ragtime,'' which his agency handled until Livent filed for bankruptcy protection.</p>
        <p>The sole Broadway production now handled by Wilner is the musical ''Saturday Night Fever.'' That show is shifting its account to Serino Coyne, said Bill Evans, a spokesman, after receiving ''a memo from Jon Wilner resigning the account.''</p>
