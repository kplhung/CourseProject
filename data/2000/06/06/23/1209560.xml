        <p>The United States Embassy in Jordan issued a warning this morning that it has ''information concerning terrorist targeting'' of the embassy and ''cannot rule out'' the possibility of terror attacks on American citizens.</p>
        <p>An embassy spokeswoman in Amman, the capital, said the embassy could not divulge the nature of the feared attack, the identity of the suspected terrorists or the source of its information.</p>
        <p>''While the United States has full confidence in the government of Jordan's demonstrated ability and willingness to address security threats, the full dimensions of the threat are not known,'' the embassy said in its statement.</p>
        <p>Though Jordan has no recent history of terrorist attacks on Americans or other foreigners, 28 people are currently on trial in Amman for what Jordanian prosecutors say were planned bombings and assaults on local hotels and tourist sites timed to coincide with Christmas and millennium celebrations at the end of last year.</p>
        <p>American tourists were to have been singled out in those attacks, prosecutors contend. The defendants are said to have been enlisted and trained by associates of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Muslim militant now based in Afghanistan, who is accused of responsibility for the 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
        <p>''American citizens traveling or residing in Jordan should exercise prudence, and are urged to review their security practices, and to remain alert to changing situations,'' the embassy said. ''American citizens should avoid large crowds and gatherings, keep a low profile and vary routes and times of all required travel.''</p>
