        <p>ABYSSINIAN CHRONICLES  By Moses Isegawa  462 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $26</p>
        <p>Like many first novels, Moses Isegawa's ''Abyssinian Chronicles'' is a first-person account of a young man's coming of age: a discursive tale of familial struggles, thwarted romances and picaresque adventures. Mr. Isegawa's book, however, takes place in the 1970's and 80's in Uganda, a country wracked by Idi Amin's brutal reign of terror and the fallout of civil war; and his story not only traces his hero's loss of innocence but the dissolution of his entire family and by implication that of an entire country and way of life.</p>
        <p>Mr. Isegawa's narrator, Mugezi, is a latter-day descendant of Fielding and Thackeray's blackguards, transported to the peculiarly lawless landscape of Mr. Amin's Uganda. A malcontent and sometime scoundrel, Mugezi has learned to manipulate and dissemble in the course of surviving a Dickensian childhood of alarming violence and barbarity. He tells the story of his life in a blunt, rough-hewn narrative devoid of anything resembling rationalization or emotional censorship. He does nothing to conceal the rage he feels against his parents and refuses to sentimentalize, or justify, his own unsavory actions. As a result his story has a strange amoral power, an immediacy and raw energy that capture the chaotic mood of his times.</p>
        <p>The tone of the book is remorseless, its language overheated. ''Uganda was in a state of siege, writhing like a dying moth on the floor,'' Mr. Isegawa writes. ''The bugles of defeat were poised, waiting to blow the walls down. The inside of the country was like a grenade whose pin had already been drawn. There was an explosive feeling in the air.''</p>
        <p>In the course of two decades of political and social turmoil Mugezi's family suffers a succession of violent losses. His grandfather's sister, who worked as the village midwife, is killed during the coup in which Idi Amin seized power in 1971. One of his aunts is gang-raped by soldiers during a clash between Mr. Amin's forces and the guerrillas. Another aunt, who was tortured for her work with anti-Amin forces, comes to power in the aftermath of his overthrow but soon dies of AIDS.</p>
        <p>As for Mugezi's other relatives, they will succumb to the centrifugal forces of history and domestic discord, leaving their small ancestral village for the alienating streets of Kampala, and in the case of Mugezi,  eventually leaving Kampala for a life of exile abroad.</p>
        <p>Mugezi repeatedly refers to his parents as ''the two dictators,'' drawing implicit comparisons between their tyrannical rule over their children and Mr. Amin's tyrannical rule over Uganda. Mugezi's mother, Padlock, is a former nun who was expelled from the convent for beating her students, and her six children bear the brunt of her frequent and irrational rages. His father, Serenity, tends to hold himself apart from their domestic wrangles but on one occasion beats Mugezi so severely that the boy thinks he is going to die.</p>
        <p>To get back at his parents, Mugezi contrives a series of cruel practical jokes. He forges a love letter from one of his mother's admirers, causing his father to suspect a heated love affair; he steals the bobbin from his mother's sewing machine, undermining her business as a seamstress. (Such is the economic reality of Uganda that it takes her 90 days to get a new one through the black market.) His pranks continue when he is sent away to a seminary school: he vandalizes a car belonging to one of the priests and defaces the boat of another school official.</p>
        <p>It is at the seminary that Mugezi inadvertently discovers a love of books: in a mercenary effort to get an easy white-collar job at the school, he finagles himself a position in the library and stumbles into the realization that books offer a respite from the dog-eat-dog world around him: they offer ''a reliable escape route into a safer reality crammed with fantasy and ideas.''</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for the reader, Mugezi's accounts of his travails at home and school quickly grow long-winded. Though his darkly comic descriptions of his parent's abusive behavior are initially shocking, they soon devolve into a repetitive pattern of complaint, and the reader begins to tire of his crude put-downs and even cruder vows of revenge. When Mugezi looks beyond the suffocating world of his own travails, however, he proves himself a perceptive observer, setting down the stories of friends and family members with a mixture of nostalgia, sadness and regret.</p>
        <p>There's his uncle Kawayida, a meter reader for the local energy company and a master storyteller, who loses a girlfriend and his youngest child to AIDS. There's his former schoolmate Lwendo, who persuades Mugezi to join him in a get-rich-quick scheme involving piracy and blackmail. And there's his grandfather, who warned of the political ''powder keg'' created by colonialism, and who dies a violent death during the turmoil surrounding Mr. Amin's downfall in 1979.</p>
        <p>Together with Mugezi's own tale, the stories of these characters provide a window on recent Ugandan history, a window that enables us to understand the terrible ways in which public history can intrude upon private lives, the ways in which the political becomes the personal.</p>
