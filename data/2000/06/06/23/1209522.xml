        <p>In the mind of your average theatergoer, the musical ''Footloose,'' which posted a July 2 closing this week, bears many of the hallmarks of a long-running Broadway hit.</p>
        <p>By the end of its run, after all, it will have staged 737 performances, playing at the Richard Rodgers Theater for well over a year and ahalf; it will have been seen by hundreds of thousands of people; and it will have spawned a cast album, a national tour (with another planned) and promises of future companies in London, Australia and points beyond.</p>

        <p>In the mind of your average theatergoer, the musical ''Footloose,'' which posted a July 2 closing this week, bears many of the hallmarks of a long-running Broadway hit.</p>
        <p>By the end of its run, after all, it will have staged 737 performances, playing at the Richard Rodgers Theater for well over a year and ahalf; it will have been seen by hundreds of thousands of people; and it will have spawned a cast album, a national tour (with another planned) and promises of future companies in London, Australia and points beyond.</p>
        <p>But despite all that, it is to date, and without a doubt, a financial flop.</p>
        <p>As such, the show is a case study in the always daunting risks and unseen pitfalls faced by today's producers of Broadway musicals, a group often faulted for their taste but never their checkbooks. It also re-emphasizes, despite the faith in the power of marketing, the steep climb faced by shows with bad reviews trying to return their investment.</p>
        <p>''Footloose'' opened in October 1998 at an estimated cost of $6.5 million and to a bushel of poor notices,  with a few good ones mixed in. Still, producers pushed ahead, and their effort was not without precedent. In recent years, after all, shows like ''Annie Get Your Gun'' and ''Smokey Joe's Cafe'' have overcome negative reviews to build audiences with newfangled demographic direct mail and old-fashioned advertising blitzes. For ''Footloose,'' producers aimed at suburban radio outlets and newspapers, hoping to tap into fans of the musical's source material, the hit 1984 film that starred Kevin Bacon.</p>
        <p>The musical's backers were also banking on another time-tested strategy: brand building. Producers are often willing to take a loss in New York with hopes of making it back on the road, where costs are lower, and any ''Broadway musical'' is often the biggest -- and only -- show in town. Indeed, ''Footloose'' begat a tour almost immediately, sending a troupe out just two months after the show's Broadway debut.</p>
        <p>The producers' strategems showed some early success, and weekly sales in New York reached the $550,000 range in November 1998, a profit of roughly $150,000 a week. At the end of the year, during the Christmas rush, the sales topped $700,000.</p>
        <p>But there were also problems. One was that the costs were more than expected because of advertising in New York, which often reached $400,000 a week. Initial projections called for operating costs of $350,000 or less. The show's brand also proved less lucrative than expected on the road, with half-filled houses in some cities. And unlike musicals or plays that might become films, ''Footloose'' did not hold out the hope of a sale to another medium; the movie, after all, was already made.</p>
        <p>Michael David, the president of the Dodger Theatricals, which produced ''Footloose,'' did not return several calls for comment. But an investor who has seen the show's financial statements said that by last December it had returned only 5 percent of its initial investment, a figure that might have grown to about 20 percent by its closing. Still, producers soldiered on, some weeks losing money, others earning some.</p>
        <p>By this spring a new show, ''Seussical,'' a musical based on the canon of Dr. Seuss, announced it would take over the Richard Rodgers Theater in the fall, meaning ''Footloose'' would have to fold or move. In recent months producers retooled parts of the show and began a new ''Footloose Five'' advertising campaign, featuring the five young male leads, a strategy aimed at cashing in on the current boy-band craze. It showed some effect, but in recent weeks box-office grosses dropped precipitously.</p>
        <p>In the end, there was simply no more gas in the tank. As one producer not connected to the show said, '' 'Footloose' burned, but never exploded.''</p>
        <p>Many a New Day</p>
        <p>There were subtle signals this week that the production of ''Oklahoma!,'' tentatively scheduled to open on Broadway on Dec. 7, was inching closer to fruition, and that its theater of choice would very likely be the Ford Center for the Performing Arts, home to ''Jesus Christ Superstar.''</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for neither show would confirm the rumors, but sales for ''Superstar'' have not been, well, stellar. Last week it sold 54 percent of its seats. A ''Superstar'' cast member who spoke on condition of anonymity said rumors were flying backstage that the show would close shortly after Labor Day, adding, ''It has certainly not been lost upon us that attendance is not great.''</p>
        <p>Asked about the possibility of making way for ''Oklahoma!,'' Adrian Bryan-Brown, a spokesman for ''Superstar,'' said the producers were about to ''launch a very aggressive advertising and marketing campaign, because they believe the show has a very large summer audience.''</p>
        <p>But what about the fall, when ''Oklahoma!'' is due?</p>
        <p>''We have supreme confidence 'Superstar' will find a summer audience,'' Mr. Bryan-Brown reiterated.</p>
        <p>Arbor Day</p>
        <p>The last time Jeffrey Wright performed in Central Park, in 1991, the city was in a recession, Christopher Walken and Raul Julia were playing Iago and Othello, and Mr. Wright was playing, in his own words, ''the third cyprus tree from the left.''</p>
        <p>Much has changed. Beginning on Aug. 8, Mr. Wright will be playing Marc Antony in ''Julius Caesar,'' at the Delacorte Theater, alongside Jamey Sheridan (Brutus) and David McCallum (Caesar).</p>
        <p>The production is nicely timed, Mr. Wright said. ''There's something perfect about doing this Roman play in the middle of this Roman city,'' he said, referring to New York's imperial pre-eminence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wright's transition from tree to leading man has been a steady one, including performances on Broadway (''Angels in America,'' ''Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk'') and on film (''Basquiat''). Currently most people probably associate him with his film-stealing performance in ''Shaft,'' in which he plays a drug dealer named Peoples Hernandez, prone to mangled English (''You can't turn off the dogs of war'') and menace.</p>
        <p>Since the movie opened last week Mr. Wright has been besieged with offers, but he said he couldn't pass up the chance to play a man ''who becomes the very thing that he despises.''</p>
        <p>''Going back onstage,'' he said, ''is a chance to control what I have.''</p>
