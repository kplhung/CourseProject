        <p>Flavors of Spain</p>
        <p>The popularity of Spanish restaurants in New York is not surprising because Spanish foods are so satisfying and full of lusty, robust flavors. Here are 11 places in Manhattan to sample them. (These summaries are taken from dining reviews, columns and articles in The Times by William Grimes, Eric Asimov and others.)</p>
        <p>1. Bolo  ** (Rating -- Two Stars)  (212) 228-2200  23 East 22nd Street  Manhattan  $$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Bolo's Spanish-accented design, with graphic collages adorning the walls and dizzy tiles dancing around the oven, is a feast for the eyes rivaled only by the bold Spanish-inspired fare of the chef, Bobby Flay. Little brown rings of fried squid come with a lemony parsley pesto and a lively anchovy vinaigrette, both so good that you soak them up with bread. Other appetizers include a sprightly salad of octopus and sweet onion, served warm and dressed in vinaigrette with sage, and roasted garlic littleneck clams with serrano ham. Among main courses, there are a roast pork tenderloin stuffed with walnut romesco, served with caramelized date-shallot sauce and roasted garlic potato gratin; pepper-crusted Black Angus sirloin with sherry vinegar steak sauce and smashed fingerling potatoes with cabrales blue cheese; and whole cracked lobster served in the shell with sherry vinegar-tarragon sauce and salsa verde risotto.</p>

        <p>1. Bolo  ** (Rating -- Two Stars)  (212) 228-2200  23 East 22nd Street  Manhattan  $$$ All major cards</p>

        <p>2. Cafe Riazor  +  (212) 727-2132  245 West 16th Street  Chelsea  $ American Express</p>
        <p>This Spanish hideaway, four steps down from an otherwise residential block, seems as if it has been there forever. The dim lights, the old travel posters and the stucco walls all look like remnants of the 1950's, when a place like Riazor might have been a bohemian thrill. In fact, it opened in the early 70's and serves an unchanging menu of Spanish classics, like chunks of cold octopus, marinated until tender and spiced with red pepper; rounds of sizzling chorizo in red-wine sauce; shrimp in a bubbling sauce of garlic and olive oil; and wonderful caldo gallego, the Galician soup with meats, greens, white beans and potatoes. Paella, unfortunately, is a disappointment.</p>
        <p>3. Dalia's  +  (212) 865-9541  984 Amsterdam Avenue, near 109th  Street Manhattan  $ All major cards</p>
        <p>Restaurant choices around Columbia University improved greatly when this dimly lighted, attractive taperia opened last summer. While some of the choices are inconsistent, tiny clams steamed in a garlic-laden broth are excellent, as are briny grilled sardines served over toast with an excellent little green salad. Potatoes cut into cubes, fried until crisp and served with aioli are irresistible, while grilled chorizo is always a crowd-pleaser. Service can be scattered and charming at the same time, if only because a restaurant like this strives more to be pleasant than serious.</p>
        <p>4. Kna  +  (212) 343-8180  324 Spring Street, near Greenwich Street  South Village  $ All major cards</p>
        <p>Kna is a tapas bar, with the accent more on bar than on restaurant. Expect music, smoke and all the other accouterments of gathering spots. The tapas are not spectacular, but they are just right for this casual good-time place. The best choices include boquerones, anchovies pickled in a sweet-and-sour marinade; shrimp in a sizzling green garlic sauce just right for mopping up with bread; pickled sardines; and octopus in smoked paprika sauce.</p>
        <p>5. Marichu  +++  (212) 370-1866  342 East 46th Street  Manhattan  $$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Unusual Spanish and Basque dishes in an unusual location, near the United Nations, draw a crowd of diplomats and others interested in dishes like clams in a garlic-and-wine sauce, and tender baby squid served in a sauce of leeks, onions, tomatoes and ink. With the exception of several unappealing salmon dishes, it is best to stick with seafood: try the crowd-pleasing shrimp in sizzling garlic sauce, the fillet of red snapper in a garlic vinaigrette with scalloped potatoes, or red peppers stuffed with a creamy puree of cod in an intense sauce made with dried red peppers.</p>
        <p>6. Meigas  * (Rating -- One Star  (212) 627-5800  350 Hudson Street, at King Street  South Village  $$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Meigas, in a former industrial building, is very large with high ceilings and a light, beachy color scheme, dominated by sand and aqua, which gives it the feel of a giant bathhouse. A long bar near the entrance serves tapas, and in the main dining room, well-spaced tables and wraparound windows add to the feeling of lightness and buoyancy. The flavors at Meigas sing clearly. Ingredients taste exactly like what they are, and in combination they interact without getting lost. This sense of clarity and definition helps elevate rustic dishes like rabbit loin wrapped in salty bacon and surrounded by sauteed scallops, pearl onions, scallions and garlic confit, or the juicy and flavorful rib-eye steak, served with potatoes and piquillo peppers. The dessert menu includes bread pudding, crunchy at the edges with baked sugar, and topped with a wonderfully dense, sourish ice cream made from torta del Casar, a runny sheep's milk cheese from Extremadura; and laminas de chocolate: layers of chocolate, coffee-brandy mousse and walnuts served with chocolate flan and a foam made of parsley.</p>
        <p>7. N Crosby  +  (212) 219-8856  33 Crosby Street, near Broome Street  SoHo  $ Cash only</p>
        <p>At N Crosby, a small but stylish tapas bar, you can pick and choose among small dishes, like shrimp sauteed in olive oil with garlic and spicy red pepper; octopus and steamed potato cubes; and of course the ubiquitous Spanish omelet with onions and potatoes. N Crosby is also one of the best places in New York City to taste sherries, the fortified wines made in the Andalusia region of southern Spain. Try a delicate, flavorful manzanilla with boquerones, anchovies that taste like pickled herring. It's a classic combination.</p>
        <p>8. La Paella  +  (212) 598-4321  214 East Ninth Street  East Village  $ Mastercard and Visa</p>
        <p>Dim, small, crowded, smoky and loud with urgent flamenco guitar, La Paella looks like an American fantasy of a little Spanish tapas bar. Tapas are the specialty, despite the name (though the paella is quite good, too). About 20 selections are available daily, like the classic Spanish potato omelet; wedges of dense, rich Manchego cheese served with apple slices; breaded asparagus wrapped in slices of smoked salmon; and marinated anchovy fillets. La Paella makes a mean sangria, but the small selection of sherries is the perfect accompaniment to tapas.</p>
        <p>9. Solera  ** Rating -- Two Stars  (212) 644-1166  216 East 53rd Street  Manhattan  $$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Solera looks so cozy it is almost impossible not to be drawn into the long room, with its terra-cotta tiles and romantic lighting. From the moment a waiter arrives with dishes of cool, bracing green olives and warm roasted almonds, you know you are in good hands. The menu, which has changed since The Times reviewed Solera, offers many interesting contemporary Spanish choices, like spicy grilled chops and leg of lamb tagine served with couscous and sheep's cheese; grouper grilled a la plancha (a Spanish-style flat grill) and then poached in a potato and scallion bouillon; and paella for two. Appetizers include fried calamari with pimento ali-oli; serrano-style ham, chorizo and sweet and hot salchichon served with tomato bread; and ceviche-stuffed piquillo peppers with beet tartare.</p>
        <p>10. Taperia Madrid  +  (212) 794-2923  1471 Second Avenue, near 77th Street  Manhattan  $ All major cards</p>
        <p>As credible a tapas bar as is likely on the Upper East Side, Taperia Madrid has its priorities right. It's a bar first, with noise, smoke, a lack of creature comforts and a casual attitude that is winning unless you expect a quiet, leisurely meal. It has a nice list of sherries, Spanish wines and beers, and the tapas are quite good, particularly boquerones (fine marinated anchovies), big, meaty grilled sardines, and sauteed scallops served on the shell with roe intact.</p>
        <p>11. Xunta  +  (212) 614-0620  174 First Avenue, near 11th Street  East Village  $ All major cards</p>
        <p>This boisterous, exuberant bar sticks close to the Spanish tapas bar tradition, capturing the animated spirit without fear of smoke and high decibels. The owner and staff of Xunta (pronounced SHOON-tuh) are all Spanish, as is the music. The dim room has a long bar and several upended barrels with two chairs each, as well as a few picnic tables for larger groups. The best among the 40 listed tapas are richly delectable grilled sardines, octopus broiled with paprika, and littleneck clams in a marinade of wine and garlic.</p>
