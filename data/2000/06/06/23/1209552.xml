        <p>Profiting from gains in stock trading and investment banking, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Company reported yesterday that net income in its fiscal second quarter rose 27 percent from the period a year earlier but fell 6 percent from the first quarter.</p>
        <p>Morgan Stanley, the biggest securities firm measured by market value, said it earned $1.46 billion, or $1.26 a diluted share, in the quarter that ended May 31, compared with $1.15 billion, or 97 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1999.</p>
        <p>Although the results exceeded the analysts' consensus estimate of $1.13, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, Morgan Stanley's stock dropped $2.4375, to $83.1875. Its shares are more than $10 below the high mark they hit in April.</p>
        <p>''Their trading profitability was much stronger than most people thought it could be'' in a quarter that was interrupted by a sharp decline in Nasdaq stocks, said Guy Moszkowski, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst.</p>
        <p>Morgan Stanley benefited from a trading strategy that positioned the firm to gain whether stocks rose or fell, Mr. Moszkowski said. As long as stock prices were volatile, which they were, the firm would profit, he said.</p>
        <p>Robert Scott, the firm's chief financial officer, said it made more money trading stocks, oil and other commodities last quarter than in any other quarter. ''Having lots of volume, lots of uncertainty, lots of price volatility fits our trading style very well,'' Mr. Scott said.</p>
        <p>Revenue from the firm's securities businesses rose 28 percent, to $5.45 billion and total net revenue -- revenue minus interest expense -- rose 25 percent, to $7.07 billion. The money it took in as investment banking fees and commissions, much of it from customers of its Dean Witter brokerage unit, increased by more than 30 percent from a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Return on shareholders' equity was 33 percent, up from 31 percent a year earlier, but down from an unusually high 36 percent in the first quarter.</p>
