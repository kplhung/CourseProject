      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In Mike Milbury's five seasons as general manager, his Islanders never have made the playoffs but they usually lead the National Hockey League in excuses, many of them legitimate. Various owners lacked the money or the commitment to revive what was once a dynasty. Budget demands forced Milbury to trade good players and to slash his payroll.</p>
        <p>But major developments recently have both encouraged Milbury and increased pressure on him. First, the Islanders won the draft lottery. Although they finished with the third-worst record in the 28-team league and two new teams will enter with an expansion draft of veterans on Friday, the Islanders will choose ahead of everyone on Saturday in the entry draft for young prospects in the Saddledome here.</p>

        <p>In Mike Milbury's five seasons as general manager, his Islanders never have made the playoffs but they usually lead the National Hockey League in excuses, many of them legitimate. Various owners lacked the money or the commitment to revive what was once a dynasty. Budget demands forced Milbury to trade good players and to slash his payroll.</p>
        <p>But major developments recently have both encouraged Milbury and increased pressure on him. First, the Islanders won the draft lottery. Although they finished with the third-worst record in the 28-team league and two new teams will enter with an expansion draft of veterans on Friday, the Islanders will choose ahead of everyone on Saturday in the entry draft for young prospects in the Saddledome here.</p>
        <p>The other boost was the sale of the team to Charles Wang and Sanjay Kumar, formally approved this week by the N.H.L. Board of Governors. The new owners have promised to provide the funds needed to compete. The Islanders' payroll last season of approximately $16 million was about one-quarter that of the Rangers. Although they represented extreme ends of the sport's salary spectrum, neither team made the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Milbury, whose team went 24-49-9, has several highly regarded prospects already on his roster or about to sign. He can use the top pick to add in this area or to trade for an established veteran or two, before or after the draft. Whatever moves Milbury makes, he senses a mood of accountability and reckoning.</p>
        <p>''A big part of me says, 'Stay patient, stay patient,' '' Milbury said. ''Another side of me says 'How much longer can everybody take it?' I'm not an idiot, contrary to what some people will tell you. Sooner or later, the finger has to stop elsewhere and point at me. That time is coming and I accept it.''</p>
        <p>Conceding that many teams have contacted him about trading his draft choice, Milbury said: ''We really have thrown around some wild scenarios that we actually think we could make happen. I'm entertaining offers not only for the pick but for certain of our players.''</p>
        <p>The gathering begins Friday when the Columbus Blue Jackets and the Minnesota Wild each draft 26 veterans. All established teams except Nashville and Atlanta, the recent expansion teams, will lose two players. The entry draft, predominantly for amateurs who are 18 years old, occurs on Saturday and Sunday. A trade embargo will be lifted after the expansion draft Friday.</p>
        <p>One significant player who could affect the dealings around the draft is Aleksei Yashin, the center and former captain of the Ottawa Senators, who did not play in the N.H.L. last season because of a contract dispute. The Senators suspended Yashin, who was a finalist in the voting for most valuable player in 1999. The team and the league are pursuing a grievance, charging that Yashin owes them another year of service and should not become a restricted free agent on July 1. An arbitrator's decision is expected before then.</p>
        <p>No matter the resolution, the Senators might trade Yashin, who is requesting a yearly salary of up to $10 million, for draft choices or players. The Islanders might be among the teams considering Yashin.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the Rangers, under the leadership of their new president and general manager, Glen Sather, have no first-round draft choice, because they traded it to Tampa Bay in a deal that allowed the Rangers to draft both Pavel Brendl and Jamie Lundmark in the first round last year. The Rangers have a second-round pick this time, but no third-round selection.</p>
        <p>Comparing his team to the veteran-laden Rangers, who have missed the playoffs for the last three seasons, Milbury said of Sather: ''He'll keep it amusing. He's got a lot of work ahead of him. I'd much rather be in my shoes than his in terms of playing personnel. I have a lot more hope for the future.''</p>
        <p>The Stanley Cup champion Devils are usually among the league's shrewdest drafters and have stockpiled choices this year. They will choose 22nd as a result of a deal that brought Claude Lemieux to New Jersey for Brian Rolston early last season. The Avalanche will get the Devils' pick, at No. 27. In addition, the Devils have three picks in the second round and two in the third round. It adds up to six choices among the first 75 players.</p>
        <p>Among the top amateurs, Milbury seemed particularly impressed with Marian Gaborik, a left wing from Slovakia who scored 25 goals in 50 games in a major league in his home nation. ''I saw him play more than any player in the draft,'' Milbury said. ''I saw him play at least a dozen times. He's going to be fine.''</p>
        <p>The top-rated player by the N.H.L.'s Central Scouting Bureau is Dany Heatley, a left wing from the University of Wisconsin. Among other highly rated prospects are Rick DiPietro, a goalie from Boston University, and Rostislav Klesla, a Czech defenseman.</p>
        <p>In the expansion draft, Columbus and Minnesota must choose at least 3 goalies, 8 defensemen and 13 forwards. They can draft up to six free agents or restricted free agents and get compensatory choices if those free agents sign elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Among the most attractive names in the expansion pool are unrestricted free agents like Mark Messier of Vancouver, Mathieu Schneider of the Rangers and Lemieux of the Devils. Other available Rangers, under contract, are forward John MacLean and goalie Kirk McLean.</p>
        <p>Doug MacLean, general manager of the Columbus Blue Jackets, and Doug Risebrough, general manager of the Minnesota Wild, have worked together on mock drafts and have shared information about possible trades with established teams after they make their selections.</p>
        <p>When asked whether he had informed team and league lawyers about this to avoid questions of collusion, Risebrough said they were discussing only what teams were fearful of losing certain players.</p>
        <p>Milbury, counting on returning players like Mariusz Czerkawski and Tim Connolly, among others, said the Islanders were ''not far away from an expansion-type level.''</p>
        <p>''But we think we're in a position to move ahead pretty quickly,'' he said.</p>
