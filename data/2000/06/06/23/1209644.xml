      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Oil and gas money has been the essential lubricant of Gov. George W. Bush's political career.</p>
        <p>It financed his unsuccessful run for Congress in 1978, it helped him win the governor's office in 1994 and it is now fueling his run for president.</p>
        <p>In the current presidential contest, Governor Bush has raised 15 times more money from oil and gas interests than Vice President Al Gore; his biggest lifetime patrons are employees of the Enron Oil Company and at least 25 of his top fund-raisers, the Pioneers, are connected to the oil business.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has received financial support from many of the biggest names in the Texas ''oil patch'': the Hunt brothers, the Bass family, A. R. Sanchez Jr., Kenneth Lay, Roy Huffington and David and Charles Koch. The second largest source of contributions for his presidential campaign is the Houston law firm Vinson &amp; Elkins, which prides itself on the size and reach of its oil and gas practice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has remained largely mute on the recent spike in gasoline prices, even as Mr. Gore loudly accuses oil companies of price gouging, antitrust violations and collusion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush blames the Clinton administration for environmental and energy policies that discourage oil exploration and that have contributed to the high prices consumers, particularly in the vote-rich Midwest, are paying at the gas pumps. While he supports a new Federal Trade Commission investigation, Mr. Bush has not even hinted that oil industry greed could be at the root of the recent price increases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said that the administration has shown a lack of leadership on the issue and called on President Clinton to lean harder on oil-producing countries to ''open the spigots'' to bring gasoline prices down.</p>
        <p>His attitude reflects his background in West Texas oil business, as well as the views of his friends and financial backers in the industry.</p>
        <p>''He himself came out of the oil and gas business in Midland, so his soft stance on the current oil crisis is understandable,'' said Craig McDonald of Texans for Public Justice, a watchdog group in Austin. ''Bush's financial support comes heavily from the oil industry. They are the kingmakers that put him in the governor's mansion and are the kingmakers that will try to put him in the White House because his policies coincide with their interests.''</p>
        <p>In the current campaign, Mr. Bush has received $1.54 million from people employed in the oil and gas business and related industries. According to Federal Election Commission filings compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, individuals from 670 oil-related interests contributed to the Bush campaign, from $250 contributions from Texas gas station owners to scores of $1,000 donations from executives of the nation's biggest oil companies, gas pipeline concerns and oil field service companies.</p>
        <p>Among the largest contributors are Enron ($92,250), El Paso Energy ($39,834), Koch Industries ($32,200), Exxon Mobil ($30,575), Coastal Corporation ($22,475) and Bass Brothers Enterprises ($21,000).</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has received less than $100,000 in contributions from people associated with the oil business. No single energy-related organization provided as much as $10,000 to the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>The center also tallied oil industry contributions to individual candidates and the two major political parties. It found the industry gave a total of $10.7 million to Republican candidates and committees and $3.2 million to Democrats.</p>
        <p>According to another study published earlier this year, four of Mr. Bush's top five career patrons are in the oil and gas business. The study, by the Center for Public Integrity, looked at Mr. Bush's campaigns for Congress, the governor's office and the presidency, as well as donations for renovations of the Texas governor's office and Mr. Bush's inaugural celebrations.</p>
        <p>The four concerns are Enron, the Sanchez family of Laredo, Tex., Vinson &amp; Elkins and the Bass family of Fort Worth. Together they have given more than $1.5 million to advance Mr. Bush's political prospects.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush drew substantial support from oil interests in his unsuccessful run for Congress from West Texas in 1978. According to federal campaign reports and local newspaper accounts, roughly half of Mr. Bush's campaign treasury came from friends and acquaintances in the Texas oil business.</p>
        <p>That year, The Midland Reporter-Telegram, in the heart of the West Texas ''oil patch,'' enthusiastically endorsed the young Mr. Bush, citing his experience in the oil fields.</p>
        <p>''He has first-hand knowledge of the oil and gas business, gained through his work as an independent land man and oil producer,'' the paper said.</p>
