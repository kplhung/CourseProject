        <p>The Project  427 West 126th Street, Harlem  Through June 30</p>
        <p>A play of layered vision animates this clean, low-key, three-person show. The British artist Glenn Brown, short-listed for the next Turner Prize, is represented by photographs of paintings by Goya and Picasso that he shot from book reproductions, then blurred into soft focus. The new images are abstract but suggestively organic, different from but still attached to the paintings they came from.</p>
        <p>The New York artist Peter Rostovsky also moves between media, but in the opposite direction. His oil-on-canvas paintings appear to be abstract but they actually depict special-effects scenes from science fiction films -- a flood of light from ''Star Trek II,'' a starburst from ''2001'' -- that the artist photographs from a television screen. Here, abstract painting arrives filtered through two separate popular media to find its rarefied transcendentalist reputation both sullied and sustained.</p>

        <p>The Project  427 West 126th Street, Harlem  Through June 30</p>
        <p>A play of layered vision animates this clean, low-key, three-person show. The British artist Glenn Brown, short-listed for the next Turner Prize, is represented by photographs of paintings by Goya and Picasso that he shot from book reproductions, then blurred into soft focus. The new images are abstract but suggestively organic, different from but still attached to the paintings they came from.</p>
        <p>The New York artist Peter Rostovsky also moves between media, but in the opposite direction. His oil-on-canvas paintings appear to be abstract but they actually depict special-effects scenes from science fiction films -- a flood of light from ''Star Trek II,'' a starburst from ''2001'' -- that the artist photographs from a television screen. Here, abstract painting arrives filtered through two separate popular media to find its rarefied transcendentalist reputation both sullied and sustained.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Rostovsky tackles the spiritual realm, Julie Mehretu seems intent on creating an elaborately stratified social cosmos in a diptych titled ''Arcadia and Bushwick Burning.'' Bars of modernist color float like continents against a neutral ground. Drawn over them in ink are webs of images: topographical maps snarled with architectural forms, sooty clouds of dots and dashes like aerial views of population centers. The results suggest a conceptual version of history painting, with hand-wrought depictions of loose data shifting and weaving through cyberspace.</p>
