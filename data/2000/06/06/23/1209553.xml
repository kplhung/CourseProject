        <p>In a major test case, a federal appeals court has upheld a Texas law allowing patients to sue health maintenance organizations in state court for medical malpractice.</p>
        <p>But the judges struck down a part of the law that gave patients the right to an independent review of H.M.O. decisions denying benefits or coverage.</p>
        <p>In the decision on Tuesday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, ruled on the first of a new wave of state laws expanding the legal liability of H.M.O.'s.</p>
        <p>The court upheld the liability provisions of the Texas law by construing them narrowly, allowing patients to sue an H.M.O. for providing substandard care, but holding that they may not sue when a health plan denies care altogether on the ground that it is not a covered benefit or is not medically necessary.</p>
        <p>The ruling was not a complete victory for either patients or insurance companies. The plaintiffs, all units of Aetna Inc., said today that they were pleased with the decision. Consumer advocates said the ruling showed why Congress must define patients' rights, including the right to sue.</p>
        <p>The court struck down a part of the Texas law that allows patients to seek review, from an independent panel of medical experts, when they are denied specific benefits. Federal law prescribes the exclusive remedies for a denial of benefits, and states may not supplement those remedies with ''a quasi-administrative procedure for the review of such denial,'' the court said.</p>
        <p>The appeals court ruling applies only to states in the Fifth Circuit: Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. But the reasoning could have broad implications. Thirty-eight states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, have laws authorizing independent, or external, review of health plan decisions.</p>
        <p>Consumer groups, H.M.O.'s and insurance companies all support such review as a way to resolve disputes without litigation. H.M.O.'s can still provide such review voluntarily, and Aetna said it would do so.</p>
        <p>The Texas law allowing patients to sue H.M.O.'s was the nation's first, adopted in 1997. Since then at least six states -- Georgia, California, Washington, Arizona, Oklahoma and Maine -- have passed laws permitting patients to sue on various legal theories.</p>
        <p>Most of the state laws are broader than the Texas statute and allow suits in a wider range of disputes.</p>
        <p>The House and the Senate have passed bills to define patients' rights, including the right to an independent review of H.M.O. decisions. The House bill would also make it easier for patients to sue, but Republican senators say it would increase the cost of health insurance. Negotiators from both houses are deadlocked.</p>
        <p>Jill Griffiths, a spokeswoman for Aetna, said: ''We are pleased with the decision by the court of appeals in the Texas case. The decision confirms federal pre-emption of all state law claims for benefit administration and coverage disputes.''</p>
        <p>Stephanie W. Kanwit, a lawyer who represents insurance companies and H.M.O.'s, said the ruling on the Texas law was important. ''This was the first major challenge to one of the seven states that have laws allowing a person to sue an H.M.O. for medical malpractice,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Joanne Hustead, a lawyer at the National Partnership for Women and Families, a consumer advocacy group, said the ruling ''underscores the need for Congress to change'' a 1974 federal law regulating employee benefits.</p>
        <p>Under the court decision, a patient may sue an H.M.O. in Texas for providing care in a negligent way. But the patient may not sue if the H.M.O. refused to furnish any care at all, on the ground that the care was not covered or not necessary.</p>
        <p>Clearly, Ms. Hustead said, this distinction is untenable. The United States Supreme Court observed last week that, in the real world of medical practice, many decisions involve questions of both treatment and coverage.</p>
        <p>Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer group, said: ''This is the most harmful federal court decision to date affecting patients' rights. If the Supreme Court does not reverse it, consumers will be left virtually helpless when H.M.O.'s improperly deny or delay needed health care.''</p>
        <p>Judge Patrick E. Higginbotham wrote the opinion for a three-judge panel in the Texas case, Corporate Health Insurance v. Texas Department of Insurance. The other members of the panel were Judges Robert M. Parker and Nancy F. Atlas.</p>
        <p>Judge Higginbotham upheld the liability provisions of the Texas law as an exercise of the state's ''police power to protect its citizens'' by regulating ''the quality of medical practice.'' The law, he said, imposes liability on an H.M.O. for certain negligent acts committed by doctors acting as agents of the health plan.</p>
