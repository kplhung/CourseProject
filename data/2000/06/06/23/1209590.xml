        <p>Oil prices showed no sign of retreating a day after OPEC decided to increase production, and lawmakers stepped up calls for investigations into ''price gouging'' in the gasoline market.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers are especially concerned about the Midwest. While pump prices are at record levels in much of the nation, they have had an astounding rise in the Midwest. Retail prices in Milwaukee and Chicago have soared as much as 70 cents a gallon in the last two months because of pipeline disruptions and a federally mandated switch to a new cleaner-burning fuel that incorporates ethanol.</p>
        <p>Despite the 2.6 percent rise in crude oil prices yesterday, the price of gasoline in the Midwest may have finally leveled off, some officials said. New supplies are coming on the market, refiners have increased production of the new gas and wholesale prices have fallen.</p>
        <p>The Federal Trade Commission, which is investigating whether the soaring prices could be a result of industry collusion, expects to report its findings to Congress by the third week of July, said Robert Pitofsky, the agency's chairman. The F.T.C. is expected to begin issuing subpoenas within days, and some lawmakers want industry chief executives to be required to testify on the matter.</p>
        <p>President Clinton, facing a political firestorm over the issue, said he believed there was ''no economic explanation'' for the high Midwest prices. Vice President Al Gore, the presumed Democratic presidential candidate, reiterated his belief that industry collusion may be stoking the problem.</p>
        <p>But industry officials blame supply problems, low inventories of gasoline and the June 1 switch to the cleaner fuel, and they point to a recent Congressional Research Service report suggesting that the cleaner-gas mandate and pipeline problems had added 50 cents to the price of a gallon of gas in some parts of the Midwest.</p>
        <p>Gasoline prices have been high this year, after OPEC's move in March 1999 to reduce oil production. But since the beginning of May, average pump prices for regular gasoline have soared almost 30 cents nationally, while Chicago and Milwaukee, two of the cities required to use the new cleaner-burning fuel as of June 1, have had far higher increases.</p>
        <p>In futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange today, crude oil for August delivery rose 82 cents, to $32.19 a barrel. And gasoline for July delivery, which reflects wholesale prices, soared more than 4 cents, to $1.0813 a gallon.</p>
        <p>The runup has become a major political issue, as Mr. Gore and officials at the Environmental Protection Agency have sought to deflect criticism that the high prices are because of the mandate for cleaner-burning reformulated gas. They have suggested some companies may be making too much money at the expense of drivers.</p>
        <p>For certain, industry profits are soaring. About three months ago, Wall Street analysts were predicting second-quarter profits of $5.5 billion for the seven major United States oil companies, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks corporate earnings. Now analysts are predicting combined profits will be about $6.5 billion. That compares with about $3 billion during last year's second quarter.</p>
        <p>But many analysts are skeptical that federal officials will find evidence of illegal behavior. ''This is a political sop,'' said Philip K. Verleger, who has served as a consultant to the F.T.C. and the State of California on past investigations into high gas prices and is now a senior adviser at  the Brattle Group, an economic consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. ''They aren't going to find anything.''</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed Republican presidential nominee and a former oilman who has taken almost $1.5 million in political contributions from the oil and gas industry, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, has said he welcomes the investigation into possible industry collusion. But he blames the Clinton administration for not doing a better job in cajoling OPEC to increase production. Some lawmakers in Congress also took a swipe at OPEC today, saying they would introduce a bill to allow the Justice Department to look into possible antitrust violations by the cartel.</p>
        <p>But OPEC ministers in Vienna, who met this week and agreed to raise production by 708,000 barrels a day, complain that the United States is at fault for the high prices. They blame the new cleaner-burning gas rules, which affect about one-third of the nation, and they also contend that American refiners cut back purchases drastically last year to avoid buying oil at prices they considered temporarily high.</p>
        <p>''It is not an OPEC problem,'' said Ali Rodriguez, Venezuela's oil minister and the current president of OPEC. ''In the last year, refinery runs have been very low and we saw a great decline in'' inventories.</p>
        <p>Sheik Saud Nasser Al-Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister, said: ''This is also a responsibility of the major consuming countries. They should get their own houses in order.''</p>
        <p>Top Saudi officials, who have been the leading advocates of production increases, are genuinely alarmed about what they view as prices that are too high to be stable. But they argue that the supply of crude oil is only a peripheral part of the problem.</p>
        <p>One Saudi official contended that United States oil companies refused to invest in added capacity even when refining margins were high, and though the Saudis do not want to be drawn into the political debate about the mandate for the new cleaner fuel, this official asserted that the rules were imposed without paying attention to the situation of United States refiners.</p>
        <p>Since their initial decision to increase production three months ago, OPEC ministers have said they want to keep oil trading roughly within a band of $22 to $28. But Saudi officials believe the price band is being constantly tested by the markets, and they now say they should not be held hostage by short-term price movements, especially if those are being driven by speculation.</p>
        <p>But Iran's oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, was more conciliatory. Having angrily denounced Energy Secretary Bill Richardson in March, Mr. Zanganeh went out of his way today to note that there was no external pressure on OPEC this time, and that was the reason that Iran had no difficulty in joining the OPEC action.</p>
        <p>''You and me and Mr. Richardson have all learned a lesson,'' Mr. Zanganeh told reporters. ''It was a very good test for the market. Many sources expected the volume of production would decrease the price of oil significantly, but it hasn't happened. It means we have some new factors in the market.''</p>
        <p>Asked what he thought the biggest culprit behind high oil prices is, he said, ''RFG,'' referring to the new cleaner-burning reformulated gasoline.</p>
