        <p>Legislators in New Jersey today joined the growing list of state lawmakers trying to give drivers a break from rising prices at the gasoline pump by moving to postpone a July 1 increase in the gas tax.</p>
        <p>The higher tax at the pump would amount to only pennies at first, but without today's action, it would have increased as prices rose. The amount of the increase would have depended on the average price of a gallon of gas in the state in the first six months of the year, a figure that will not be reported until next month.</p>

        <p>Legislators in New Jersey today joined the growing list of state lawmakers trying to give drivers a break from rising prices at the gasoline pump by moving to postpone a July 1 increase in the gas tax.</p>
        <p>The higher tax at the pump would amount to only pennies at first, but without today's action, it would have increased as prices rose. The amount of the increase would have depended on the average price of a gallon of gas in the state in the first six months of the year, a figure that will not be reported until next month.</p>
        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has approved the postponement, and it is headed for enactment on Thursday.</p>
        <p>The tax, which is adjusted every six months, is now 4 cents per gallon. The state also charges an excise tax of 10.5 cents per gallon; it would not be affected by the measure.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we would be doing drivers in New Jersey any favors by raising gas taxes with prices as high as they are,'' said Assemblyman Leonard Lance of Flemington, vice chairman of the Assembly Appropriations Committee, when the measure was approved without dissent.</p>
        <p>Massachusetts also faces a price-triggered tax increase. Some legislators there want to block a law that raises the state tax to 22 cents per gallon, a 1-cent increase, if the price per gallon reaches $1.68, and 24 cents if it reaches $1.80.</p>
        <p>Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon of Indiana announced on Tuesday that he was suspending his state's 15-cent-per-gallon tax for 60 days because of high prices in the Midwest, now routinely over $2 per gallon. Legislatures in Michigan, Illinois and Ohio are talking about similar moves.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey tax, the Petroleum Products Gross Receipts Tax,  amounts to 2.75 percent of the price of refined petroleum products, from grease to diesel fuel, with a minimum tax of 4 cents a gallon on gasoline, based on a price of $1.44.</p>
        <p>The law contained a trigger: if the six-month average price exceeded $1.44, the tax would rise to 2.75 percent of the price. If the Board of Public Utilities reported that the average price was $1.50, for example, the tax would increase by one-tenth of a cent. If gas reached $2 per gallon, the tax would rise to 5.5 cents.</p>
