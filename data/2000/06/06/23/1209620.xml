        <p>You remind us of how Al Gore's generation was affected by the Vietnam War. What I found particularly striking in the article was the reminder that events forced some of us to make a choice to do something we did not want to do.</p>

        <p>Re ''On Campus Torn by 60's, Agonizing Over the Path'' (front page, June 21):</p>
        <p>You remind us of how Al Gore's generation was affected by the Vietnam War. What I found particularly striking in the article was the reminder that events forced some of us to make a choice to do something we did not want to do.</p>
        <p>I received my draft notice in 1970, while in my senior year of law school. I was opposed to the war and took part in numerous demonstrations. But I knew that if I avoided induction, I could never be admitted to practice. I was inducted into the Army about 10 days after graduation. I was lucky: I was not sent to Vietnam.</p>
        <p>Now, some 30 years later, I still wonder whether my decision to submit to military service was right.</p>
