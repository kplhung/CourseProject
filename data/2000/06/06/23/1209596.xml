        <p>Bill Mechanic, the top executive at the 20th Century Fox movie studio, unexpectedly resigned this afternoon on the eve of the release of what could be the studio's biggest hit in more than a year following a string of box-office disappointments.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Mr. Mechanic said that he was leaving Fox after seven years to start his own ''more independently structured motion picture entity,'' to produce movies without the encumbrances and infrastructure of a major studio.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mechanic said, ''I feel now is the time to pursue other personal ambitions. Although these plans are not yet firm enough to discuss, I am pretty far along a track that will grant me creative freedom.''</p>
        <p>No replacement for Mr. Mechanic was named.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mechanic was chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, the unit that oversaw all films released under the 20th Century Fox banner as well as under the Fox 2000 and Fox Searchlight banners. Fox is releasing ''Me, Myself and Irene,'' starring Jim Carrey as a highway patrolman with a split personality.</p>
