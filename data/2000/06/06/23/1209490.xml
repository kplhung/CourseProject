        <p>It's hard to stroll through the Great Hall of the New York Hall of Science in Queens and not feel as if you've been left in Jurassic Park after the inhabitants have been let loose. You're surrounded by huge and hungry-looking creatures, and while they may not be prehistoric, almost all are dinosaurs' descendants.</p>
        <p>They are among the denizens of ''Reptiles: Real and Robotic,'' a new exhibition created by the San Diego Natural History Museum and a company called Kokoro Dinosaurs. It is intended to inspire respect for species that are often dismissed with shudders. And it's difficult not to be respectful when confronted with an alligator snapping turtle and a Western diamondback rattlesnake that look as if they got an overdose of test-bomb radiation in a 1950's science fiction movie: the turtle is 10 times life size, and the snake is 36 feet long.</p>

        <p>It's hard to stroll through the Great Hall of the New York Hall of Science in Queens and not feel as if you've been left in Jurassic Park after the inhabitants have been let loose. You're surrounded by huge and hungry-looking creatures, and while they may not be prehistoric, almost all are dinosaurs' descendants.</p>
        <p>They are among the denizens of ''Reptiles: Real and Robotic,'' a new exhibition created by the San Diego Natural History Museum and a company called Kokoro Dinosaurs. It is intended to inspire respect for species that are often dismissed with shudders. And it's difficult not to be respectful when confronted with an alligator snapping turtle and a Western diamondback rattlesnake that look as if they got an overdose of test-bomb radiation in a 1950's science fiction movie: the turtle is 10 times life size, and the snake is 36 feet long.</p>
        <p>Of course, they are robots, but the real ones are no less impressive. Creatures from gila monsters to bearded dragons to blue-tongued skinks are shown alive and kicking, or, in some cases, alive and licking. You will learn, for instance, that the leopard gecko uses its long tongue to clean itself, including its eyeballs.</p>
        <p>Children will enjoy ''Reptiles Revealed'' shows each day in the hall at 1 and 3 p.m. At noon and 2 p.m., they can see demonstrations of NASA's use of robotics. They can even take a reptile home -- as a craft, that is -- by making a gecko glider or a snake mobile. (There is a $1 materials fee.)</p>
        <p>From July 1 through Aug. 26, the Hall of Science will also offer shows of live reptiles every Saturday at 2 p.m. for $2. The stars may not be able to sing and dance, but they do have a talent for survival: they have been around for 300 million years.</p>
        <p>''Reptiles: Real and Robotic,'' through Sept. 17 at the New York Hall of Science, 47-01 111th Street, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 699-0005. Hours: Monday through Wednesday, 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Thursday through Sunday, 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; in July and August, Monday from 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Tuesday through Sunday, 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $7.50; the elderly and ages 4 to 17, $5; 3 and under and members, free; free Thursdays and Fridays in June from 2 to 5 p.m.</p>
        <p>Field Days</p>
        <p>Strawberry fields will soon seem to be part of Queens as well as of Liverpool, England, and Central Park. Not forever but for the weekend.</p>
        <p>This time the cause for celebration is not the Beatles, but the berry. The Queens Country Farm Museum in Floral Park will hold its third annual Strawberry Festival, which will offer treats for all sorts of appetites.</p>
        <p>''The most intriguing thing is that you are on a genuine working farm while you're in the city,'' said Amy Fischetti, the museum's executive director. ''We're completely planted, and some of the early crops might be being harvested -- lettuce, asparagus and, of course, strawberries.''</p>
        <p>Most of the festival's strawberries will be from Long Island (the farm doesn't produce enough for large crowds), but families can visit the museum's new greenhouse complex and see how the plant is cultivated. They can also tour the Adriance Farmhouse, built in 1772. ''The tours will be directed to kids, if we have enough of them,'' Ms. Fischetti said.</p>
        <p>Children will also be invited to feed sheep and goats, go on hayrides, dance to a country-and-western band and take part in relay races and games like hot potato -- played with a fake strawberry, of course.</p>
        <p>Strawberry Festival, tomorrow and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Queens Country Farm Museum, 73-50 Little Neck Parkway, Floral Park, (718) 347-3276, extension 10. Admission: $2; 12 and under, free.</p>
        <p>Homing Instincts</p>
        <p>Many a builder would admire the ingenious architectural models just erected on Staten Island: one is for a home with walls of recyclable material; another has a secret tunnel; a third is designed for millions of tenants. Still, none of them will ever be in House and Garden or Architectural Digest, and if they were, their creators would have nothing to say.</p>
        <p>Snobs? No, they're just not human.</p>
        <p>The designs are part of ''Animals as Architects,'' a new exhibition at the Staten Island Children's Museum. Created by the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, the exhibition shows that animals are also concerned about energy efficiency and comfort. Wasps, for instance, have air-conditioning: they fill empty spaces in their nests with water and fan them with their wings.</p>
        <p>Preschoolers are invited to open compartments in the model dwellings to find hidden nests. They can also do a jigsaw puzzle of a beaver dam and nest in a huge pile of straw.</p>
        <p>Older children can examine building materials and tiny tenants with a microscope, analyze blueprints and match species to their dwellings.</p>
        <p>If animal housing reminds you of the three little pigs, go next door to ''Pigtails and Hard Hats.'' Prepared by the Muncie Children's Museum and Blair O Rama, an exhibits developer, this show uses the storybook characters to teach about the construction industry.</p>
        <p>Young visitors can step inside model houses and install their wiring, plumbing and insulation; they can also shingle roofs and build chimneys. The idea is to make them sound enough to withstand the scrutiny of the building inspector, a blowhard by the name of B. B. Wolf.</p>
        <p>''Animals as Architects,'' through Sept. 3, and ''Pigtails and Hard Hats,'' through Aug. 28, at the Staten Island Children's Museum, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, (718) 273-2060. Hours: Tuesday through Sunday, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $4; under 2 and members, free.</p>
