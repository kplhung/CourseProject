        <p>New Jersey's Fish and Game Council voted unanimously tonight to resume hunting black bears in the state for the first time in 30 years, but on a far smaller scale than it proposed in March.</p>
        <p>Bowing to pressure from Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, animal-protection groups and foes of hunting, the council approved a two-day hunt -- Sept. 18 and Sept. 22 -- for a maximum of 175 bears.</p>
        <p>The council's earlier plan, which touched off broad protest, had called for the killing of up to 350 bears in a three-part season: Sept. 16 to 23, Sept. 30 to Oct. 27, and Dec. 4 to 9.</p>
        <p>The council's reduction in the number of bears to be killed matched a proposal that Governor Whitman made eight days ago.</p>
        <p>Before the council voted -- 9 to 0, without comment -- for the more modest hunt, Charles Suk, chairman of the game committee, noted the unpopularity of the original proposal: about 2,300 people wrote to the council or testified at a hearing earlier this month about the plan; 1,300 opposed it and about 1,000 supported it.</p>
        <p>After the vote, an official of the Humane Society of the United States denounced the resumption of the hunt. ''We don't want a hunt period,'' said Barbara Dyer, the program coordinator for the society's mid-Atlantic regional office. ''We don't want one black bear killed.''</p>
        <p>Patrick Carr, senior wildlife biologist with the state's division of fish and wildlife, called the scaled-down hunt a ''very conservative'' measure that was designed to protect the state's black bear population.</p>
        <p>New Jersey banned bear hunting in 1970, when its bear population had become all but extinct. Once protected, the few remaining native bears, and some from the Catskills in New York and the Poconos in eastern Pennsylvania, started the species' recovery in the wooded hillsides of Sussex County, at the state's northwestern tip.</p>
        <p>Now the population is robust. State wildlife officials estimate that New Jersey has about 1,000 black bears in the countryside east of Interstate 287 and north of Interstate 78. And increasingly, the officials say, the bears are getting into all sorts of trouble with residents.</p>
        <p>In the last five years, wildlife control officials say they have received steadily increasing complaints about bears getting into houses, poking around backyard decks, disrupting barbecues, rummaging around campsites and picnic areas, killing goats and sheep, attacking dogs, and getting into garbage cans and beehives.</p>
        <p>John W. Bradway, chairman of the fish and game council, has said that the primary reason for the hunt is public safety. Although no black bear attacks or injuries have been reported, Mr. Bradway said recently that people living in bear country were worried that children would be attacked.</p>
        <p>Until mid-June, Governor Whitman had said little publicly about the proposed hunt. But in a letter to Mr. Bradway on June 14, she said she and state environmental officials had received hundreds of anti-hunt letters since March. And she noted that scores of opponents turned out at a council hearing on the hunt on June 6. In response to the outcry, she asked the council to approve the killing of 175 bears this year, half the number the council had proposed.</p>
        <p>In her letter, Governor Whitman said the bears posed ''very real public safety issues.'' But she also asked the council for a deeper study of nonlethal means of reducing the population. The plan enacted tonight recommended that the Division of Fish and Wildlife analyze ways to reduce the bear population through various methods of birth control.</p>
