        <p>Delta Air Lines, Air France, Aeromexico and Korean Air announced an alliance yesterday that would stretch across three continents and try to compete with pacts already formed by rivals.</p>
        <p>The airlines will be able to pool frequent-flier programs and coordinate schedules in the alliance, called SkyTeam.</p>
        <p>Industry analysts who follow Delta, the No. 3 airline in the United States, said its participation is primarily a marketing strategy to help Delta catch up to its larger domestic rivals, United Airlines and American Airlines, which have established global partners. The alliance should also help Air France compete with Lufthansa of Germany, a United partner, and British Airways, an American partner.</p>
        <p>''It's a defensive position,'' said Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. ''They're banding together to preserve market share.''</p>
        <p>Currently, the strongest group of carriers is the Star Alliance, which includes United, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines.</p>
        <p>For passengers, the advantage of flying an airline that participates in an alliance is the convenience. Passengers need to book only one ticket and check in baggage once, regardless of how many times they change carriers.</p>
        <p>''We recognize that Star Alliance is the best-functioning alliance today,'' Leo F. Mullin, Delta's chief executive, told reporters in New York. ''We believe that we are going to start close to second place Day 1.''</p>
        <p>Other airline alliances said they saw little significant threat. Chris Chiames, a spokesman for American, said, ''We're pleased to finally welcome this grouping of airlines to the world of alliances.''</p>
        <p>Like the Star Alliance, SkyTeam will offer frequent-flier perks like priority check-in and luxury lounges. Passengers with more than 100,000 miles will be guaranteed an economy-class seat.</p>
        <p>Although SkyTeam is entering the game at a later stage than its major competitors, analysts said it should be able to compete effectively with United's Star Alliance, American's One World, and Continental's Wings Alliance.</p>
        <p>''They start out behind the other three major alliances which have been in operation for a while,'' said Philip Baggaley, a managing director at the Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation. ''However, both Delta and Air France are strong across the Atlantic. At least it has gotten Delta and Air France more firmly into the alliance game.''</p>
        <p>But SkyTeam could face problems in Asia, where it lacks a strong hub. Neither Delta nor Air France has booked passengers on Korean Air since April 1999 , when safety issues led both airlines to suspend dealings with the airline.</p>
