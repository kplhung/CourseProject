        <p>Two months ago, at a tribute concert to Joni Mitchell, Diana Krall surprised everyone by forsaking her crisply emphatic jazz piano style to perform Ms. Mitchell's impassioned folk-pop ballad ''A Case of You'' without the usual support of bass and drums. Freed from the austere jazz settings she favors, Ms. Krall's sharply accented, blues-embellished piano relaxed into a minimalist pop mode, and her voice took on a startling dramatic intensity. Certain lines were punched out (''Constantly in the darkness/Where's that at?''), while other words and phrases (especially the word ''darling'') found her trailing off into a smoky whisper.</p>
        <p>Coming from a performer as diffident as Ms. Krall, the shift in mood and style was a small revelation. Exploring the musical world of her fellow Canadian, Ms. Krall exposed a vulnerability that had only been hinted at in her recordings, most notably in the title song of her recent best-selling album, ''When I Look in Your Eyes'' (Verve).</p>

        <p>Two months ago, at a tribute concert to Joni Mitchell, Diana Krall surprised everyone by forsaking her crisply emphatic jazz piano style to perform Ms. Mitchell's impassioned folk-pop ballad ''A Case of You'' without the usual support of bass and drums. Freed from the austere jazz settings she favors, Ms. Krall's sharply accented, blues-embellished piano relaxed into a minimalist pop mode, and her voice took on a startling dramatic intensity. Certain lines were punched out (''Constantly in the darkness/Where's that at?''), while other words and phrases (especially the word ''darling'') found her trailing off into a smoky whisper.</p>
        <p>Coming from a performer as diffident as Ms. Krall, the shift in mood and style was a small revelation. Exploring the musical world of her fellow Canadian, Ms. Krall exposed a vulnerability that had only been hinted at in her recordings, most notably in the title song of her recent best-selling album, ''When I Look in Your Eyes'' (Verve).</p>
        <p>Ms. Krall's JVC Jazz Festival concert on Wednesday evening at the Supper Club offered two such moments. Once again, she performed ''A Case of You'' as the unguarded meditation of someone dreaming out loud. During her encores, she recaptured the same mood in a performance of the Sinatra-identified ballad ''I Fall in Love Too Easily.'' Again, the piano faded into the background, and Ms. Krall's clear, dark alto transformed a sugarcoated valentine into a love junkie's piercingly critical self-assessment.</p>
        <p>The rest of the concert found Ms. Krall leading a quartet (featuring the spiky blues guitar of Dan Faehnle) through a program dominated by the 1940's and 50's material she has always favored, but interpreted from a wised-up perspective that makes her suggest a jazz-oriented answer to the rock singer Chrissie Hynde. Even at her softest, Ms. Krall never tries to be sweet and ingratiating. What emotion she reveals tends to leak through a tough, assertive facade as her voice momentarily cracks into a quivering vibrato.</p>
        <p>Ms. Krall's vocal style is really a reflection of her spare, hard-driving pianism, whose very austerity reinforces a certain defensiveness. When singing songs associated with that sorcerer of seduction, Peggy Lee (the concert included ''I Love Being Here With You'' and ''I Don't Know Enough About You''), Ms. Krall divested them of the flirtatiousness that Ms. Lee employs to soften her toughness. Throughout the concert, Ms. Krall maintained a rhythmic tension by phrasing songs like an acrobat swinging from bar to bar, using consonants to build momentum for the many quick tumbling leaps. It was all quite impressive, if a little forbidding.</p>
