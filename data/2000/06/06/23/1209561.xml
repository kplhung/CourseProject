        <p>Editorial says State Department may invite ridicule by replacing the evocative term 'rogue nations' with the more diplomatic 'states of concern,' but it is right to recognize that the world has changed in ways that require new approaches to countries like North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan and Cuba</p>

        <p>It is easy to ridicule the State Department for replacing the evocative term ''rogue nations'' with the more diplomatic and touchy-feely ''states of concern'' when referring to trouble spots like North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan and Cuba. But beyond the blurring of semantic clarity lies a welcome recognition that the world has changed in ways that make the ''rogue'' category a poor guide to intelligent foreign policy.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine Albright unveiled the new terminology in a radio interview Monday. Like rogue nations, states of concern have unpredictable, authoritarian leaders, histories of sponsoring terrorism and, Cuba excepted, programs for building biological, chemical or nuclear weapons. But as the department's new language recognizes, the strategy of lumping all these countries together as international rogues, unreachable through normal tools of diplomacy and fit only for isolation and military containment, has grown out of date.</p>

        <p>It is easy to ridicule the State Department for replacing the evocative term ''rogue nations'' with the more diplomatic and touchy-feely ''states of concern'' when referring to trouble spots like North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan and Cuba. But beyond the blurring of semantic clarity lies a welcome recognition that the world has changed in ways that make the ''rogue'' category a poor guide to intelligent foreign policy.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine Albright unveiled the new terminology in a radio interview Monday. Like rogue nations, states of concern have unpredictable, authoritarian leaders, histories of sponsoring terrorism and, Cuba excepted, programs for building biological, chemical or nuclear weapons. But as the department's new language recognizes, the strategy of lumping all these countries together as international rogues, unreachable through normal tools of diplomacy and fit only for isolation and military containment, has grown out of date.</p>
        <p>North Korea is an obvious case in point. Its once-reclusive leader just held a successful meeting with his South Korean counterpart, and both sides now talk of national reconciliation and economic interchange. Pyongyang has honored its agreements with Washington to suspend nuclear weapons development and flight-testing of long-range missiles. In response, Washington has eased economic sanctions and made North Korea Asia's largest recipient of American assistance.</p>
        <p>Other nations formerly known as rogues have not come that far. But for years Washington has been engaged in a delicate courtship with reform-minded elected officials in Iran. Indirect diplomacy with Libya, through the United Nations, helped bring the Lockerbie bombing suspects to trial. Many members of Congress have begun to recognize that a less restrictive policy toward Cuba could increase America's ability to influence political change there as the Castro era draws to a close.</p>
        <p>Some states of concern still require ostracism, containment and military threats. One clear example is Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which defies United Nations Security Council resolutions, reneges on its diplomatic promises and would quickly divert any export revenues it could get its hands on into weapons programs. Every serious foreign problem facing America requires its own specific policy prescription. No longer talking about rogue states will make that easier to explain.</p>
