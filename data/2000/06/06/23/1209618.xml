        <p>UNIVERSAL DISPLAY, Ewing, N.J., a developer of flat-panel displays, was named the prime contractor of a $1 million contract from the Department of Defense to make flexible, lightweight display materials.</p>
        <p>LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES, Murray Hill, N.J., the maker of phone equipment, said it would invest $110 million and add 250 workers to increase production at its optical fiber plant in Brondby, Denmark.</p>
        <p>RAILAMERICA, Boca Raton, Fla., the largest holder of regional railroads in the United States, said it would sell as many as 10 small rail properties and other assets as part of a plan to reduce debt by more than $100 million.</p>
        <p>AVENTIS, France's largest drug maker, said it would shut its Virogenetics vaccine-research laboratory in Troy, N.Y., because the cost of operating the 26-worker site had become too high. The Virogenetics research will be moved to the Aventis Pasteur laboratory in Toronto.</p>
