        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature today agreed to adopt the nation's most far-reaching package of gun controls and a sweeping overhaul of sex crimes laws that imposes tougher penalties and provides new services for victims.</p>
        <p>Racing to close this year's legislative session, the lawmakers also agreed on a package of measures to improve school safety. One would require that schools fingerprint job applicants, including prospective teachers, and conduct criminal background checks on them. Another would increase penalties for students who assault teachers and teachers who assault students, and yet another would make it easier for teachers to remove disruptive students from their classrooms.</p>
        <p>The fate of a hate crimes law remained uncertain late into the evening as the Democratic Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, and the Republican Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, continued to squabble over the packaging of a bill whose contents they have agreed on.</p>
        <p>And it appeared very unlikely that the Assembly would pass a bill backed by the Senate and the governor to reform the rules for Republican presidential primaries, over fears about how the bill would affect Democratic primaries.</p>
        <p>Dozens of deals were struck and hundreds of bills passed on what had been billed as the last day the Legislature would be in session this year, after frenzied, nearly round-the-clock negotiations in the last week by the governor, the legislative leaders and members of their staffs. Today's actions decided several important issues, including these:</p>
        <p>*The Assembly declined to pass either the Senate's or Mr. Pataki's version of a bill that would have required legislative approval for a proposed Indian casino in Monticello, in the Catskills. Mr. Silver said the Assembly could decide to return in a special session in December to vote on the Senate bill.</p>
        <p>*The governor and both houses agreed to a bill that greatly broadens state laws against money-laundering, including applying those laws to wire transfers.</p>
        <p>*The Assembly passed a Senate bill that would make it legal for mothers of newborn infants to abandon their babies in safe places, like hospital emergency rooms or police stations. Similar laws have been enacted in Texas and in Germany, and advocates say they reduce the number of newborns killed by their mothers. The Assembly vote sends the bill to the governor, who has not said what he will do with it.</p>
        <p>*All three sides agreed on a measure to aid the New York Stock Exchange's expansion plans, including authorizing a city agency to sell $255 million in bonds and authorizing a state agency to acquire property across the street from the current exchange.</p>
        <p>*All three sides agreed to a bill allowing towns and villages to regulate, or even ban, the use of personal watercraft, a provision long sought by some communities and by environmentalists.</p>
        <p>*The Assembly refused to pass a bill permitting $125 million a year in tax cuts by New York City because it included a decrease in hotel taxes that the Democrats opposed.</p>
        <p>The gun control bill agreed to tonight closely mirrors the one that Mr. Pataki, a Republican, proposed earlier this year, stunning Republicans and Democrats alike, and prompting gun control advocates to declare him a leader in their cause. Gun owners' groups and the firearms industry have derided the measures as either an intrusion on their rights or meaningless posturing.</p>
        <p>''This important legislation will help make our streets safer by reducing gun violence in communities across the state,'' Mr. Pataki said tonight.</p>
        <p>The governor, while never opposed to gun controls, had shown little interest in the issue until this year, and he and several Senate Republicans have said they were motivated to act in part by a series of highly publicized mass killings at schools around the country. The Assembly, controlled by Democrats, has passed a variety of gun control measures over the years, while the Republican majority in the Senate has generally opposed them and agreed to parts of today's deal with great reluctance.</p>
        <p>The bill will make New York the first state in the country to require ''ballistic fingerprinting'' of all new guns sold. Each gun will be test-fired before sale so that the telltale markings it leaves on bullets and shell casings can be recorded and entered into a state computer database for later comparison to slugs and shells found at crime scenes.</p>
        <p>The bill requires background checks on all gun buyers at gun shows to weed out people with criminal records who are prohibited from owning buns. Federal law requires licensed gun dealers to conduct background checks on buyers, but most of the sales at gun shows are by private citizens who are exempt from that rule. Sixteen other states have requirements.</p>
        <p>New York will become the fifth state to ban assault weapons. A 1994 federal law banned them, but local prosecutors need a state law to bring charges in state courts.</p>
        <p>The bill requires that every new handgun be sold with a trigger lock, making New York one of six states to do so. It raises the minimum age for obtaining a handgun permit and buying a handgun from 18 to 21, the age required by 10 other states. And it requires that owners report lost or stolen guns to the police within 24 hours.</p>
        <p>Under the bill, the state police must study evolving gun technology to determine whether it would be feasible for the state to require that a handgun ''recognize'' its owner -- most likely through reading a fingerprint -- and fire only for that person. The state will also conduct a study of how many guns used in crimes in New York were bought in other states.</p>
        <p>Republican lawmakers have long called for tougher criminal penalties for sex crimes, and this year, Mr. Silver said that he agreed but insisted that they be tied to broader services for victims of those crimes. Talks on the issue languished until given new impetus by the June 11 assaults on women in Central Park after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade.</p>
        <p>By revising laws that mostly date to the 1960's, Mr. Bruno said, lawmakers ''will bring our laws into the 21st century by giving law enforcement the tools they need to keep sexual predators off our streets and protect the most vulnerable people in our society.''</p>
        <p>The bill agreed on and passed today creates a crime of ''forcible touching,'' a felony, to apply to cases like the ones in Central Park, which until now have often been treated as misdemeanors. The bill explicitly applies the laws against rape and sodomy to cases of ''date rape,'' a connection that prosecutors have been allowed to try to make but that juries have often been hesitant to accept. And it increases penalties for repeat sexual offenders.</p>
        <p>It eliminates state law's ''marital exemption,'' an old provision that shields people from prosecution for some sex crimes committed against their spouses. It raises the maximum age for a victim of statutory rape from 14 to 15, increases penalties for repeat sex offenders and prohibits bail for people accused of the most serious sexual offenses against minors.</p>
