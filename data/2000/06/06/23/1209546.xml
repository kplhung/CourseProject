        <p>FRANCE: DE GAULLE RUNNING  The head of the far-right National Front, Jean-Marie Le Pen, announced that the grandson of Charles de Gaulle will head a list of candidates vying to represent the 20 districts of Paris in municipal elections next year. Mr. Le Pen said he was proud to be able to count on such an ''emblematic figure'' as the grandson, above, who is also named Charles de Gaulle. Other family members have been outraged at Mr. de Gaulle's affiliation with the National Front, a party long accused of fostering racism and anti-Semitism. Mr. de Gaulle, a lawyer, represents the party in the European Parliament.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: CULT CRACKDOWN  The National Assembly has unanimously passed a bill to make it easier to crack down on cults. The legislation, which still has to pass the Senate, creates a specific criminal offense of ''mental manipulation,'' or brainwashing. It also sets up procedures for courts to ban a group regarded as a cult and it provides for cults, as well as individual members, to be punished for fraud, illegal practice of medicine, wrongful advertising or sexual abuse. The bill has set off protests by the Church of Scientology and the Unification Church, among others.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: KOHL'S 'GAFFE'  Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl was accused of trivializing the Nazi persecution of the Jews after he invoked it to describe his treatment by the ruling Social Democratic government. In a television interview, Mr. Kohl said calls for a boycott of his fund-raising campaign to pay for fines imposed on the Christian Democrats for his acceptance of secret donations resembled the Nazi-era boycott of Jewish shops. Jewish leaders said this was an ''inexcusable gaffe,'' and politicians called the comparison ''horrendous'' and ''incredibly embarrassing.''</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: ROYAL UPKEEP  Taxpayers spent $22 million maintaining royal palaces last year, a saving of $1.2 million from 1998. An auditors' report itemized the upkeep costs on Buckingham Palace; Windsor Castle; St. James's Palace, where Prince Charles has his office and London apartments; Clarence House, home of the Queen Mother; and Kensington Palace, former home of  Diana. Sir John Bourn, the chief auditor, noted some delays and overruns but said, in general, ''They are managing this work well.''</p>

        <p>IRELAND: ARMY MUSIC  A British Army band will perform in Dublin today for the first time since Irish independence from British rule in 1921. The appearance at a charity event was taken in London and Dublin as a sign of improved British-Irish relations, but Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, said it would protest outside the hall.</p>

        <p>SWITZERLAND: KREMLIN CHARGES  An investigating magistrate said he planned to indict five people next week in a continuing inquiry into possible bribery in lucrative Kremlin renovation contracts. The magistrate said he would indict two heads of construction firms based in Lugano. Also to be charged are a Geneva lawyer and two asset managers. The charges follow the indictment of former President Boris Yeltsin's Kremlin property manager.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: CHRISTIAN EVACUATION  Navy ships evacuated more than 700 Christian refugees from the remote Maluku Islands, days after Muslims killed dozens of people in an attack on their village. More sectarian fighting flared in other parts of the eastern Malukus despite increased patrols by security forces, accused earlier of doing little to stop the violence. Church workers said up to 187 people have died since Monday; the military puts the toll at 111.</p>

        <p>LEBANON: ISRAELI VIOLATIONS  Israeli warplanes flew over Beirut, violating Lebanese airspace for the first time since Israel pledged to respect its neighbor's sovereignty and ended a 22-year occupation of the south. Two planes broke the sound barrier as they flew south after flying over north Lebanon, witnesses said. In the southern port of Tyre a Lebanese security official said two Israeli planes broke the sound barrier when they flew over that city.</p>

        <p>IRAN: JEWS' FATE  A prosecution official has backed defense assertions that none of the 13 Iranian Jews accused of spying for Israel will be sentenced to death. Hossein Ali Amiri, the judiciary chief of Fars Province, where the trial is being held, said the death penalty applies only to charges of fighting against God and the state, which the 13 are not accused of.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: STUDENT CLASHES  At least 15 people were hurt in clashes at the National Autonomous University of Mexico after a rally for Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, a left-leaning presidential candidate. Students who supported a recent strike at the university attacked Cardenas followers with burning flags, paint, eggs and chicken entrails, causing a 10-minute brawl.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: REBEL PLEDGE  Zapatista guerrillas announced that they would not disrupt voting in Chiapas State in July 2 elections. In an open letter, Subcomandante Marcos, the Zapatista leader, acknowledged that elections are part of the democratic process. In legislative elections in 1997, Zapatistas did not allow polling stations in areas they control.</p>

        <p>UGANDA: EARLY VIEW OF AMIN  Idi Amin, whose dictatorial rule from 1971 to 1979 left 500,000 dead, was a ''splendid type,'' good at rugby but ''not very bright,'' according to 1964 British records released by the Public Records Office in London. Dominions Office officials agreed that Mr. Amin, who commanded a Ugandan Army battalion in 1964, was essentially a good person. He lives in Saudi Arabia.</p>
