        <p>Re ''At a Slaughterhouse, Some Things Never Die'' (''How Race Is Lived in America,'' June 16):</p>
        <p>The meat and poultry industry employs nearly half a million workers in jobs that are often among the highest paying in the community. Many of those jobs provide on-the-job training for unskilled workers, often workers who have recently arrived in this country seeking new opportunities.</p>
        <p>As the work force in plants has become more diverse, employers have developed programs to help their workers assimilate. Many companies offer child care, literacy programs and tax assistance.</p>
        <p>The meat and poultry industry does not actively recruit illegal immigrant workers. In fact, the industry has worked with the Immigration and Naturalization Service to promote legal work forces in meatpacking plants.</p>
