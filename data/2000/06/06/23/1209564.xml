        <p>Not in My Buffalo, Official Protests</p>
        <p>REPRESENTATIVE JACK QUINN, Republican of New York, has two words for the playwright TERRENCE McNALLY, who is adapting the British film ''The Full Monty'' for Broadway: Why Buffalo?</p>
        <p>Mr. Quinn is upset that the stage version of the 1997 film will use his hometown as the setting for the story of six unemployed factory workers who make ends meet by becoming striptease performers. Not wanting his constituents exposed to headlines like ''Buffalo in the Buff'' -- which The Associated Press used yesterday -- Mr. Quinn wrote to Mr. McNally, demanding that the town in the play be given a made-up name.</p>
        <p>The film version of ''The Full Monty'' was set in Sheffield, England, which was depicted as a gritty industrial town whose once-mighty factories had been shut down. For the stage, the producers decided to Americanize the setting.</p>
        <p>''Your current treatment of our city is both incorrect and irresponsible,'' Mr. Quinn said in his letter to Mr. McNally. He argued that Buffalo was on the rebound, ''following in the footsteps of other cities like Baltimore and Cleveland'' in redeveloping its waterfront.</p>
        <p>Mr. McNally did not return a call for comment yesterday. But he told a reporter earlier in the year that he had checked with the playwright A. R. GURNEY, a Buffalo native, who assured him that he had Buffalo right.</p>
        <p>''People ought to come and take a look at what's going on onstage before they jump to conclusions,'' said TOM HALL, a McNally producer. ''Although it takes place in Buffalo, it in no way demeans the city or anyone in it. It's about a bunch of people who overcome adversity.''</p>
        <p>Praising Trump As Visionary</p>
        <p>First ALEC BALDWIN hugged DONALD J. TRUMP. ''I'm all for New York iconography,'' Mr. Baldwin said, ''and Donald is a New York icon.''</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Trump, who dropped out as a potential Reform Party candidate for presidency, had his say about the conservative commentator PATRICK J. BUCHANAN. ''Buchanan is not the right candidate,'' Mr. Trump said. ''The concept of the Reform Party is great. But Buchanan does not represent what the Reform Party, or any other party for that matter, should be about.''</p>
        <p>Then he headed into the ballroom at the Pierre Hotel for the main event, a dinner honoring the ''hotel and real estate visionary of the century'' -- guess who -- sponsored by the UJA Federation. ''I hope they mean the last century,'' Mr. Trump said. ''If they mean the new century, it's only six months old. I couldn't have done much.''</p>
        <p>What followed was one part award ceremony, one part celebrity roast.</p>
        <p>''This award proclaims Donald as a visionary,'' said the actor and radio personality JAY THOMAS. ''Does it mean he looked into the future and saw huge buildings filled with people that paid him rent? I look into the future and I see one of his condo boards that's not going to let me into the building.''</p>
        <p>FRAN WEISSLER, who with her husband, Barry, has produced such Broadway hits as ''Annie Get Your Gun,'' said that getting into a Trump building was not her problem -- she already lives in one.  ''Barry and I are thinking about producing a play about Donald's life,'' she said.  ''We're considering some working titles: 'Fiddling on the Roof,' 'A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Foreclosure' and 'Hair.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ubiquitous, By the Numbers</p>
        <p>DICK CLARK seemed to be everywhere yesterday: he had a morning meeting in Purchase, N.Y. (''It's unimportant,'' he said when asked the purpose. ''Business.'') That was followed by a noontime appearance at the CBS building on the Avenue of the Americas at 52nd Street. That was followed by a flight to Europe for a vacation.</p>
        <p>But he keeps tabs on things. He said that he had flown 9 million miles, produced more than 7,000 hours of television programs, and signed more than 800,000 autographs. ''That estimate was made three years ago,'' he said. ''Thank God I have a short name.''</p>
