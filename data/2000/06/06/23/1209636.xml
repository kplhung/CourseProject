        <p>The union representing 9,200 workers at Consolidated Edison warned yesterday that there was a strong chance of a strike on Sunday because the two sides remained ''miles apart.''</p>
        <p>Con Edison officials said they were confident that if the workers struck,  thousands of managers could supply power without interruption to the utility's 3.2 million business and residential customers.</p>
        <p>But union officials said a walkout would not just cause delays in repairs and reaching customer service representatives but would also create problems in the daily maintenance of the system, increasing the chance of power failures.</p>
        <p>Manny Hellen, president of Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers of America, said the negotiations were going badly because Con Ed continued to insist on concessions on health care coverage and pensions.</p>
        <p>''It's not a good situation,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''The best way I could classify it is they're on one end of the spectrum and we're on the other. We're still miles apart. It's kind of bleak right now.''</p>
        <p>Union officials negotiated yesterday with officials from Con Ed and three other power companies -- KeySpan Energy, Orion Power Holdings and the NRG Energy unit of Northern States Power, which have entered New York's energy market in recent years as part of a deregulation effort for more competition in producing electricity.</p>
        <p>Con Ed officials acknowledged that the bargaining was tense. Brenda Perez, a utility spokeswoman, said, ''We are at a critical stage in our negotiations.'' The contracts with Con Ed and the other companies expire at 12:01 a.m. Sunday.</p>
        <p>Because Con Ed is so much larger than the other companies, many labor experts predict that it will set the pattern in the bargaining. Orion has 186 workers in the union; KeySpan, 131; and NRG, 15.</p>
        <p>A strike would involve cable splicers, power plant workers, meter readers, repair workers and customer service representatives. The union members' average salary is $50,000 a year, union officials said.</p>
