        <p>Shortly after the second anniversary of the day their 19-year-old son, Brandon, was killed in an automobile accident a few blocks from their home, Amy and Tony Blount received a phone call from the county transportation department.</p>
        <p>The small white cross erected at the scene of his death, and the shrine of flowers and photographs that his friends had maintained around it, needed to come down, an official gently explained. It was, after all, illegally placed on a public right of way. But that was eight months and about 70,000 pro-memorial petition signatures ago. The cross is still there, and the Blounts have no intention of allowing it to come down. Mr. Blount has even vowed to chain himself to the cross if a road crew tries to remove it.</p>
        <p>Encouraged by friends and bolstered by their drive to gather the signatures needed to get an initiative on the state ballot this fall that would make such memorials legal, the Blounts have forged a crusade out of their grief that has generated a vigorous debate here. But the Blounts'  campaign also points up the quandary facing officials in every state: What, if anything, should be done with such memorials?</p>
        <p>No one has an exact count, of course. But state officials estimate  there are tens of thousands of memorials to the dead on roads and highways across the nation. Officials in charge of these traffic arteries agree that the number of such memorials has soared in recent years, a phenomenon generally attributed to the myriad ways in which grieving has become an evermore public process -- and even, as at the Vietnam War Memorial or the huge impromptu shrine at Columbine High School, a communal one.</p>
        <p>The roadside memorials often come in the form of small wooden crosses, erected at the scene of a traffic accident, in some cases within hours. Some bear the initials of those killed, or a personal message from  family members or friends, and some are much more elaborate, with flowers or mementos of the dead.</p>
        <p>Such memorials, if placed on public property, are almost always illegal, though some states, including Washington, have programs to erect signs at the spot of traffic deaths with safety messages or warnings against drinking and driving. Often, the memorials are left alone, unless they pose a clear safety hazard.</p>
        <p>And, as Lloyd Ensley, the traffic regulations specialist for the Washington State Department of Transportation, puts it, ''Over time, most of these seem to come down on their own without us getting involved.''</p>
        <p>But the cross memorializing Brandon here in North Bend, just beyond the fringe of Seattle's eastern suburbs, has not come down. And what is really unusual about it is the way the memorial ignited the petition drive, which is aimed at making it legal for roadside memorials up to two feet high and two feet wide to be placed near the scene of any traffic death.</p>
        <p>The Blounts are deeply angered by any suggestion that the memorial be removed from the small hill near where Brandon, a passenger in a car driven by a friend, died in a head-on accident with another vehicle as the two youths were headed to the local McDonald's early one evening.</p>
        <p>''Our son was cremated,'' Mrs. Blount, a retired owner of a mobile delicatessen, said of Brandon, who was rated as a one of the state's top chess players and had graduated from Mount Si High School a few months before his death. ''That's all we have left of him, and this memorial is so important to us, it's just not right to remove it.</p>
        <p>''I go down there and there are always new little flowers, or sculptures or necklaces. It makes me feel really good when I see all that. It makes me feel Brandon has not been forgotten by his friends. We raised a decent enough kid that a lot of other people still love him, too, and he won't be forgotten.''</p>
        <p>The Blounts would need to gather a total of about 175,000 signatures of registered voters by next month to get an initiative on the November ballot. Such a law could raise thorny constitutional issues, because so many of the memorials are in the  Christian symbol of a cross. It was for this reason that Oregon lawmakers shelved discussion of a measure to legalize small roadside memorials, after it was pointed out that so-called hate groups or fringe religious sects could assert their right to erect memorials. Even as the Legislature was discussing the issue, some swastika symbols and placards with ''K.K.K.'' and the satanic mark ''666'' were placed, anonymously, alongside cross memorials on a few Oregon roads.</p>
        <p>The issue of what to do with memorials has flared up in other ways.</p>
        <p>In Texas, state transportation officials announced this month that they would stop, at least temporarily, a policy under which road crews removed all roadside memorials except those involving a victim in a drunk-driving incident.</p>
        <p>The policy was intended to highlight the dangers of alcohol on the road, but friends and family members of people killed in accidents not involving alcohol were offended at the differential treatment accorded their memorials.</p>
        <p>A spot check of states around the nation indicates that most officially discourage roadside memorials, but often, in deference to the bereaved, take their time in removing them.</p>
        <p>''They are against the law,'' said Deborah Fehr, a spokeswoman for the Tennessee Department of Transportation. ''But we are sympathetic to the reason people put them up. So we don't drive around the state trying to take them down. Generally, unless we feel they're unsafe, we leave them in until we have some mowing or some maintenance to do.''</p>
        <p>Florida, after banning the unofficial memorials in 1997, instituted a program in which road crews would replace crosses with special highway safety markers noting the accident site. In Montana, the state has long had an informal agreement with the American Legion, allowing that organization to erect small crosses at fatal crash sites.</p>
        <p>Here in King County, which includes North Bend, officials are clearly hoping to defuse the controversy, and have backed off plans to take the memorial down. Originally a wooden cross, the memorial was vandalized and set afire, and it is now made of steel, imbedded in about 250 pounds of concrete.</p>
        <p>But in the case of the Blount memorial, some neighbors have phoned in complaints, and Linda Dougherty, acting manager of the road services division for the County Department of Transportation, said of the memorial, ''It will need, eventually, to come down.''</p>
        <p>There has been little solid research on whether highway memorials constitute a safety hazard, said Julie Rochman, vice president for communication at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a nonprofit organization in Arlington, Va.  Some defenders of the memorials suggest they are a boon to safety, encouraging people to slow down, but Ms. Rochman said she was skeptical.</p>
        <p>''I don't think, for most drivers, that it changes their behavior,'' she said. ''Most people think they're good drivers and aren't going to be involved in crashes. The people who died at the spots where those memorials are placed didn't think they were going to be involved in fatal crashes.''</p>
