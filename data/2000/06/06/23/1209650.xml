        <p>Murray Guy  453 West 17th Street, Chelsea  Through June 30</p>
        <p>Brooke Alexander  59 Wooster Street, SoHo  Through June 27</p>
        <p>Matt Mullican has been producing intricate self-invented visual systems since the beginning of his prolific career, in the 1970's. These concurrent gallery shows, which dovetail with others in Munich, Zurich and Los Angeles, offer a representative sampling of his interests.</p>
        <p>The Brooke Alexander installment, ''Drawings 1973-2000,'' mostly works on paper, covers nearly a quarter century. Anyone familiar with the artist's output will have encountered much of this or similar material before. But seeing it together in one place gives a good sense of the range and shape of a body of work that has deftly walked the line between being accessible and arcane.</p>
        <p>Early drawings establish the artist's no-frills diagrammatic style and the basic vocabulary of emblematic forms -- stick figures, houses, maps -- that take on social and metaphysical implications. These forms are often combined on a monumental scale, as in the case of a mural-size rubbing made from one of the artist's sculptural reliefs. And early on Mr. Mullican was using digital technology to plot and generate imaginary architectural forms and cityscapes.</p>
        <p>''Bulletin Boards'' at Murray Guy finds the artist in different formal terrain. Each is a slab of wood about the size of a large door covered with materials reconfigured many times over the years. One holds hundreds of matchbook covers, another stick-figure drawings, a third snapshot-style photos, some of which document a performance the artist did in the 1970's using a human cadaver as a prop.</p>
        <p>The bulletin boards are among the most immediately engaging things Mr. Mullican has done. Their tactile surfaces warm up an art that often seems physically cool and remote. Their varied images suggest darker undercurrents that flow through the work overall: mechanistic dystopian thinking, panic in the face of flux and change.</p>
        <p>They also round out the picture of an idiosyncratic career that looks particularly pertinent, even prescient, at the moment. Mr. Mullican's obsession with fictional systems, often expressed in terms of architecture and design, long ago broke ground being explored by many younger artists today.</p>
