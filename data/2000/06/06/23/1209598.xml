        <p>More than a year after the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Serbia, the United States and China officially declared today during a visit by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright that the interlude of bitterness had given way to an era of improved relations.</p>

        <p>More than a year after the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Serbia, the United States and China officially declared today during a visit by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright that the interlude of bitterness had given way to an era of improved relations.</p>
        <p>Even so, both sides said that with their relationship on firmer footing after the recent passage in the House of Representatives of a broad trade bill dealing with China, they were now focused on the sensitive issue of Taiwan and the Clinton administration's plans for an antimissile defensive shield.</p>
        <p>On human rights, an area where Washington and Beijing remain far apart, an official traveling with Dr. Albright said the Chinese leaders remained noncommittal on her request to restart an official dialogue broken off after the bombing.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright, who is on a lightning visit to China of less than 36 hours, said at a news conference that she had encouraged Chinese leaders to resume talks with Taiwan.</p>
        <p>''Our major goal is that there be a resumption in the cross-strait dialogue,'' Dr. Albright said. ''More will be gained through flexibility and appeals to shared interest than could possibly be achieved through efforts to intimidate.''</p>
        <p>But the officials she met, including Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and President Jiang Zemin, deflected her suggestion.</p>
        <p>The Foreign Ministry said at its weekly news briefing today that relations between China and the United States had ''greatly improved'' because of efforts by both sides. But the Foreign Ministry's spokesman, Zhu Bangzao, focused most of his comments on Taiwan and said that Washington must not include Taiwan in a regional missile defense system ''in any capacity.''</p>
        <p>This week, after the successful summit meeting between the two Koreas, Taiwan's new president, Chen Shui-bian, called on Beijing for a similar meeting with him. But the Chinese Foreign Ministry swiftly rejected the idea, saying that Taiwan must first agree to the ''One China'' policy, which holds that Taiwan and the Chinese mainland China are one country under Beijing's authority.</p>
        <p>Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province and has not renounced the use of military force to achieve eventual reunification.</p>
        <p>The differences between Washington and Beijing over Taiwan will persist as long as Washington supports a regional missile defense system that could be used as a shield for Taiwan, a Chinese foreign policy analyst, Chu Shulong, said today.</p>
        <p>''Theater missile defense is a total national security issue for China, and China wants a clear commitment from Washington not to provide theater missile defense to Taiwan,'' said Mr. Chu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations.</p>
        <p>Chinese leaders fear the proposed system would result in what Mr. Chu called the integration of American and Taiwanese armed forces.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chu said the proposed defense system would continue to roil Chinese-American relations because, for domestic political reasons, Washington would not give the assurances the Chinese were seeking regarding Taiwan.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright had arrived expecting a full dose of criticism about the Clinton administration's plans for a national missile defensive shield, something China strongly opposes because it could neutralize China's nuclear arsenal. But the Chinese chose not to dwell on that issue today, American officials said.</p>
        <p>One of Dr. Albright's goals on this visit was to glean the Chinese interpretation of the summit meeting between the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, and the South Korean leader, Kim Dae Jung. China and the United States share a strong interest in seeing reconciliation between the two Koreas, and administration officials have gone out of their way to note Beijing's help in encouraging North Korea to be more flexible.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright offered little new tonight on details of the Korean summit meeting. The Chinese, she said,  described Kim Jong Il as jovial, forthcoming and knowledgeable, all familiar adjectives from the past week. Tonight, one of Dr. Albright's aides said that President Jiang had noted the North Korean leader's wit and had said that he was very polite.</p>
        <p>A persistent irritant in Washington's relationship with Beijing, China's transfer of missiles and missile parts to Pakistan and other countries, was discussed, but no progress was made, officials said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright gave the Chinese qualified praise for ''the overall record'' of ''becoming part of various arms control regimes,'' including the Chemical Weapons Treaty and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. This appeared to be encouragement to get the Chinese to tighten export controls on nuclear-related materials at a time when the administration is facing criticism from Congress for being too lax toward the Chinese on this matter.</p>
        <p>Two senior nonproliferation officials, including Robert Einhorn, the assistant secretary of state for nonproliferation, visited Beijing last week to try to resolve a problem involving China's transfer of M-11 ballistic missiles to Pakistan nearly a decade ago.</p>
        <p>A report by the Central Intelligence Agency to Congress last year stated that Pakistan acquired the missiles from China, the first time that the United States had publicly stated that China was responsible. Under United States law, such a transfer requires the administration to impose economic sanctions, a move that the White House would like to avoid in this new era of improved relations.</p>
        <p>A senior administration official traveling with Dr. Albright said tonight that the problem of the transfer of weapons to Pakistan remained unresolved, and that the State Department's senior adviser on arms control, John Holum, would come to Beijing next month for further talks.</p>
        <p>The national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, has said that the administration would like China to become a full member of the Missile Technology Control Regime, the main global missile nonproliferation pact, but that China has resisted, arguing that Washington should first stop selling advanced weapons to Taiwan.</p>
