        <p>The board of directors of the Martha Graham Dance Center voted yesterday to remove Ron Protas, the artistic director of the Martha Graham Trust, which licenses dances created by Graham.</p>
        <p>Mr. Protas, who inherited the rights to Graham's work when she died in 1991, revoked the licensing agreement with the Graham Center on May 26, a day after the institution announced that it was suspending activity of the company. The company estimated that it would have a $500,000 accumulated debt if it continued through the summer.</p>

        <p>The board of directors of the Martha Graham Dance Center voted yesterday to remove Ron Protas, the artistic director of the Martha Graham Trust, which licenses dances created by Graham.</p>
        <p>Mr. Protas, who inherited the rights to Graham's work when she died in 1991, revoked the licensing agreement with the Graham Center on May 26, a day after the institution announced that it was suspending activity of the company. The company estimated that it would have a $500,000 accumulated debt if it continued through the summer.</p>
        <p>Thirteen board members voted to remove Mr. Protas. There was one abstention. Two members of the board who were not at the meeting have resigned in protest.</p>
        <p>Robert Solomon, a board member who voted for Mr. Protas's removal, said yesterday that a $250,000 challenge grant was established yesterday by a member, to be matched two to one by other board members. ''This will help us to pay off significant debt, to continue to perform and to move into new premises on East 63rd Street,'' Mr. Solomon said. Mr. Solomon said he believed that the licensing agreement was still valid.</p>
