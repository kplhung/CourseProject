        <p>IN the long run, the experts say, new technologies that prevent crashes will be crucial for improving safety. But two technologies that showed great promise on the test track have not produced statistically measurable results on public roads.</p>
        <p>One of these technologies is the dynamic stability system, which applies the brake to a single wheel and simultaneously slows the engine. Fairly new to the market, it may yet show benefits. But some engineers are wary because of their experience with the other, older technology that seemed promising, antilock brakes. When first installed in cars, the brakes actually seemed to increase the risk that the driver would die in a crash.</p>
        <p>''Their real-world performance doesn't match the promise of the test track,'' said Julie A. Rochman, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an industry group here that crash-tests cars and keeps tabs on accident statistics. Asked why, she said, ''The world is a messy place.''</p>
        <p>The institute reported in 1996 that people driving cars with antilock brakes were more likely to be involved in single-vehicle fatal crashes -- or, in plain English, running their cars off the road.</p>
        <p>Antilock brakes can sense when the wheels have been brought to a halt but the car is still moving, meaning that the car is skidding. They release and apply the brakes over and over, many times a second, to keep just enough force on the wheel to keep it from locking; the tires thus get maximum traction on the road. On test tracks, cars with such systems can stop shorter with less chance of skidding out of control.</p>
        <p>Why does the ability to stop shorter create higher risks? Experts offered several theories, none of which can be verified.</p>
        <p>One is that a driver, feeling the computer's on-off, on-off pumping of the brakes, fears that something is wrong and takes his foot off the pedal. Another is that drivers know they have a computerized system and become overconfident, driving faster.</p>
        <p>In April 2000, the institute said that later data showed that cars with antilock brakes were ''no longer disproportionately involved in certain types of fatal crashes,'' but that they did not produce any reduction in the risk of a fatal crash, either.</p>
        <p>The updated study, covering 1996-98, looked at cars that were identical except for the presence or absence of antilock brakes.</p>
        <p>''The poor early experience of cars with antilocks have never been explained, so the changes suggested by more recent data are puzzling,'' the institute said. The reason might be that drivers were learning how to use them, the group said.</p>
        <p>Bob Green, a senior instructor at Skip Barber Racing School in Lakeville, Conn., said the problem was that untrained drivers used antilock brakes incorrectly. Jam on the brakes and cause a skid in an old car, he said, and the car will go straight no matter how you turn the wheel; do the same with antilock brakes, and the car will turn the way the front wheels are pointed. That may lead to some cars ''vaulting off into the bushes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>About two-thirds of new cars now have  have become available on high-end luxury cars in recent years, and are now available on less expensive models, including the BMW 3-Series, Mercedes C-Class and M-Class, Lincoln LS and Volvo S80.</p>
        <p>Such systems keep track of the position of the steering wheel and the ''yaw rate,'' or rate at which the car is actually turning. If the two do not match, the computer steps in.</p>
        <p>Philip M. Headley, chief engineer at Continental Teves, an auto supplier that makes such a system, gave the example of a car coming to a sharp right curve on the road, too fast to take it. If the steering wheel is turned but the car doesn't turn, he said, ''we would apply a brake to the inside rear wheel, to help bring the rear end around.'' The system would also cut engine power.</p>
        <p>If the rear end starts to spin out, the system brakes an outside rear wheel, to help get it back into line.</p>
        <p>In a demonstration here last year, in a parking lot marked with orange cones and slicked with water, the system seemed to rescue the car from certain spinouts.</p>
        <p>But for now, at least, stability systems are no better endorsed by the statistics than are anti-lock brakes.</p>
        <p>''We are starting to see the manufacturers introduce devices and systems to try to improve stability,'' said Rosalyn G. Millman, acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. ''But we haven't seen that translate into improvements on the roads.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Millman spoke at a public announcement in April of proposed regulations for measuring the rollover potential of sport utilities and light trucks by comparing their center of gravity to their width, a formula called the static stability factor, that gives no credit for stability systems. ''We don't have a lot of data on how those systems are performing in the real world,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Nor will such data exist in the near future, if her agency follows the statistical system it used to derive the static stability factor; in that case, it studied car models that had been on the road for five years.</p>
        <p>Safety experts agree that the systems should reduce crashes, but they are cautious. Ms. Rochman, of the insurance institute, said, ''I have a stability system on my car, and I like it a lot.'' But, she said, there was a chance that just as some people whose cars have antilock brakes may become overconfident and drive too hard, ''people might also overdrive the stability system, and think, 'I can really fly now.'
