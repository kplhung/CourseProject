        <p>Court Rules in AT&amp;T's Favor Over Sharing of Cable Lines  A federal appeals court ruled that local governments may not force companies that offer Internet access to share their telecommunications lines with rival cable modem providers.</p>
        <p>But in ruling in favor of AT&amp;T in its case against Portland, Ore., the court defined the cable broadband business as a ''telecommunications service,'' a distinction some industry experts say may ultimately force such businesses, including AT&amp;T, to open their lines to competitors on a national level.

Although the results exceeded forecasts, the company's shares dropped $2.4375, to $83.1875. [C5.]</p>

        <p>Icahn Raises Bid for Nabisco Group  Carl C. Icahn, the financier who owns 10 percent of Nabisco Group, sweetened his offer for the company, the second time in two days he has raised his bid. On Wednesday, Mr. Icahn offered $28 a share for Nabisco Group. He then increased that bid, saying he was prepared to pay 88 percent of the after-tax cash price that Nabisco Group received for its food company, Nabisco Holdings. Both Philip Morris and a joint venture of Danone and Cadbury Schweppes have bid on the food unit. [C2.]</p>

        <p>No Big Changes Seen at Universal  Vivendi, the French conglomerate that is buying Seagram, said that it planned to make no significant changes in top management at Seagram's Universal film and television operations.

Mr. Lazio's campaign manager called the inquiry politically motivated. [B1.]</p>
