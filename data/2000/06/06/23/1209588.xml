        <p>The president of the Suffolk County Off-Track Betting Corporation, who has been a behind-the-scenes adviser to Republican leaders on Long Island for more than 30 years, resigned today after accomplishing the nearly impossible: running a gambling house and losing money.</p>
        <p>The OTB president, Walter M. Conlon, was pressured by his own party to resign after audits showed that the corporation lost nearly $275,000 in the first quarter of this fiscal year and that the losses could swell to more than $1 million by the end of the year despite receipts that increased by more than 2.5 percent over the same period.</p>
        <p>The Suffolk County Legislature began looking last week into allegations that Mr. Conlon had given expensive parties and handed out superfluous jobs and contracts to friends and relatives.</p>
        <p>When the rumors began swirling two weeks ago that he was about to be given his walking papers, Mr. Conlon, 73, said he was untouchable.</p>
        <p>''I'm an old political dog,'' he said at the time. ''And it takes a lot to put an old dog out of the house.''</p>
        <p>But on Wednesday, the Republican-controlled OTB board of directors informed Mr. Conlon that it had the votes to remove him from his position, which pays $149,000 a year. He cleaned out his desk today.</p>
        <p>''I'm leaving with my head held high,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But there is little to be proud of, county Republicans said. ''The auditors said the money was going out the back door,'' said Paul Tonna, the Republican presiding officer of the Suffolk County Legislature. ''We don't want another Nassau here. We need to reform the process.''</p>
        <p>This year's losses were the worst since OTB came to Suffolk County 26 years ago. During Mr. Conlon's 19-month term, the corporation awarded a $100,000 contract to a private security company that employs Mr. Conlon's son Michael to take receipts to the bank. The job was formerly done by the county police at no cost to the corporation.</p>
        <p>OTB, which took in $5.4 million in receipts last year, also awarded large consulting contracts to Robert Creighton, the former county police commissioner, and Howard DeMartini, the former Suffolk County Republican chairman. Last year it spent $25,000 on holiday parties and more than $5,500 on Christmas turkeys for the 375 OTB employees.</p>
        <p>''The story here is the incredible extravagance,'' said Steve Levy, a Democrat and chairman of the Legislature's Ways and Means Committee, which is investigating the corporation. ''There is too much authority in the president of the OTB to hire any person and any firm he wants for any price he chooses. It's outrageous.''</p>
        <p>OTB has always been considered a patronage mill for the faithful of both parties; the president has unilateral power to hire and fire and to award contracts. But it is a patronage mill that is supposed to make money.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of old goats feeding at the trough,'' said Richard H. Schaffer Jr., the Democratic supervisor of the Town of Babylon. ''The Republicans are showing that the old way of doing business, of just taking care of your friends, is passe and will no longer be acceptable, and that's a good thing.''</p>
        <p>It is unclear whether Mr. Conlon's resignation signals the end of a long political career because he has risen from the ashes before. When he was a state tax commissioner in charge of the state lottery under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, Mr. Conlon was convicted of bribery in 1973 in connection with a rezoning deal in the Town of Islip, and was disbarred. Even so, he successfully lobbied the State Legislature to return his license to practice law.</p>
