        <p>Ricky Ledee was grinning and pulling on a gold necklace tonight when a reporter told him about a conditional trade that would abruptly end his association with the Yankees, an organization that signed Ledee when he was only 16.</p>
        <p>Ledee stopped fiddling with the necklace for a few seconds after hearing how the Yankees had almost agreed to a trade that would bring Juan Gonzalez from the Tigers for Ledee, the Class AA infielder Drew Henson and the Class AA pitcher Randy Keisler. But, almost as soon as Ledee stopped, he returned to getting dressed. Ledee apparently wanted to show that the distressing news did not affect him.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing I can do,'' Ledee said. ''I don't know what's going to happen. When something happens, it happens.</p>
        <p>''Whoever's coming here isn't here and I haven't left yet.''</p>
        <p>It was obvious that Ledee, who has been the subject of trade speculation for a few years and has been part of intense rumors in the last few weeks, was jolted. He usually gives short answers and he usually looks questioners in the eyes, but after the 26-year-old Ledee found out that his Yankees career could be over in a day or two, he stared at the carpet and he rambled.</p>
        <p>Ledee mentioned how Jeff Moorad, his agent, had spoken to Mark Newman, a Yankees vice president, and how Newman had told him that the Yankees were considering several deals and that everyone was interested in Ledee. Ledee softly conceded that he did not want even to talk about the uncertainty, but he kept talking. Either he was too distraught or too polite to realize it, but Ledee kept going.</p>
        <p>''It would be a sad day, very sad,'' he said. ''I've been here a long time. They signed me when I was 16. That's a long time.''</p>
        <p>As Ledee buttoned his green shirt, he seemed oblivious as the details of the trade were mentioned. The Yankees are trying to sign Gonzalez to a contract extension in a 72-hour window to finalize the deal, and there was doubt as to whether the two-time American League most valuable player wanted to play in New York. Ledee, who, like Gonzalez, is from Puerto Rico, showed how benevolent he is by ignoring the doubts about whether Gonzalez wants to be with the Yankees and focusing on how it would help the team.</p>
        <p>''The thing is I know for a fact that if Juan came over here, he would be a great addition,'' Ledee said. ''I don't want to be selfish. If he came over, I'm sure he would help. If he came over here and I had to go, well, I wouldn't want to go. I'd want to stay.''</p>
        <p>When Chuck Knoblauch was told that Ledee had actually said it would help the Yankees to have Gonzalez and he did not want to be unselfish about staying with the team, Knoblauch said: ''That's shows you how good a kid he is. That also shows you that he has no control over the situation.''</p>
        <p>Derek Jeter initially declined comment about the possibility of obtaining Gonzalez out of respect for Ledee, who was Jeter's teammate during Jeter's first minor league season. Jeter shook his head, said that there have been other trade rumors that fizzled and seemed saddened by Ledee's situation.</p>
        <p>''That's got to be a tough situation for Ricky,'' said Jeter. ''He doesn't know if he's staying or going. You try to block it out, but it's tough.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch, who has hundreds of people advising him to forget about his throwing problems whenever he is playing second base, sympathized with Ledee. Knoblauch wondered how Ledee would be able to play against the White Sox on Friday night, unsure if he would still be a Yankee on Saturday.</p>
        <p>''He's going to have a sleepless night,'' Knoblauch said. ''All he's known is the Yankee organization. You have people telling you to block this out like it's easy. I should know. It's never easy.''</p>
        <p>One reporter interviewing Ledee turned to three, then four and then there were a dozen reporters in front of his locker, asking questions about something he did not control.</p>
        <p>Ledee, who went 0 for 3 in a 4-2 loss to the Red Sox to drop his batting average to .239, had his toughness challenged by George Steinbrenner last month. When Ledee was asked then what he would tell Steinbrenner if he had the chance, Ledee said, ''I'd ask him to believe in me.''</p>
        <p>It seems too late for that. Ledee walked out of the clubhouse wearing an olive suit and with a leather briefcase slung over his shoulder. He went past a security guard at the door and then along the wet, barren bowels of Fenway Park, alone and uncertain. It might have been the last time that Ledee wore a Yankees uniform, which was left behind him in the clubhouse, bunched up on the floor.</p>
