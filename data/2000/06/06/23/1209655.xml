        <p>'Hommage a l'Art'  Achim Moeller  167 East 73rd Street  Through July 7</p>
        <p>Andre Raffray, a French conceptualist born in 1925 and well-known in Europe, makes faintly amusing but visually enervating art about art. In works here from the late 70's to mid-90's he takes two basic approaches.</p>
        <p>On the one hand, using pencil, colored pencil or oil paint, he carefully copies images by Seurat, van Gogh, Mondrian and other modern masters, producing lifeless simulations of photographic reproductions; up close you can see that he has rendered details of brushwork, texture and color variation with painstaking precision.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Raffray will make a photorealist picture of the exact scene depicted by an earlier work: his contemporary painting of the Eiffel Tower, for example, matches a composition by Robert Delaunay. Often, he will present these two approaches together in diptychs. In one case, he pairs a copy of a Mondrian grid of plus and minus signs with a picture of the actual church facade it represents, with every brick and window pane neatly recorded.</p>
        <p>Mr. Raffray's project is not unlike Roy Lichtenstein's translation of modernist icons into the language of comic books or Saul Steinberg's paradoxical play with incompatible systems of representation. With his blandly meticulous technique, Mr. Raffray does not generate as much visual excitement as those artists do, but he does raise interesting questions about seeing and the construction of reality.</p>
