        <p>The House Ways and Means Committee today approved along party lines a Republican-written bill to require tax-exempt groups that conduct political advocacy to disclose their donors and spending.</p>
        <p>Efforts to broker a bipartisan bill collapsed this afternoon, and Democrats criticized the committee's legislation as unworkable, unwieldy and unconstitutional. The vote was 23 to 14.</p>
        <p>Today's vote clouds the outlook for Congress approving legislation this year that would at least end a provision in the tax law that permits a growing number of secretive groups to raise money, buy television and radio advertisements and conduct polling, but not report their contributors or spending.</p>
        <p>In a surprising vote two weeks ago, the Senate approved legislation sponsored by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, that imposed such a disclosure requirement on scores of groups formed under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
        <p>Under pressure from House Republican moderates and the Senate vote, the House Republican leadership reversed itself and promised to allow a vote before the July 4 recess on a broader political advocacy disclosure bill.</p>
        <p>The bill approved today fits that description, Republican leaders said, because it goes well beyond the narrow issue of the Section 527 organizations to cover other tax-exempt groups, from labor unions and trade associations, to the Christian Coalition and the National Rifle Association.</p>
        <p>''Voters have a right to know what groups are running ads or writing letters, and who is paying for them,'' said Representative Bill Archer, a Texas Republican who is the committee's chairman. ''It shouldn't be disclosure for some and secrecy for others.''</p>
        <p>Under the bill, organizations that spend more than $10,000 on political activities would have to disclose contributions of $1,000 or more. Currently, there is no such requirement. The bill would require all Section 527 organizations to disclose contributions and expenses of $200 or more.</p>
        <p>The legislation would take effect upon enactment, leaving open at least the possibility it could be used in the current election cycle.</p>
        <p>But Democrats immediately complained that the legislation was overly broad in defining what type of political activity or advocacy would require disclosure. Democratic leaders also criticized the bill for singling out labor unions, traditional Democratic benefactors, but not for-profit corporations, whose political leanings run Republican.</p>
        <p>''By covering educational activities clearly beyond electioneering activities, the bill would trigger very intrusive donor disclosure for all advocacy groups, including those not inherently political,'' said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader.</p>
        <p>But Republicans rejected that criticism, saying the Ways and Means Committee did not have jurisdiction over corporations in what would amount to wide-ranging campaign finance legislation. Republican leaders retorted that Democrats were hypocrites for opposing broad disclosure requirements they have been demanding.</p>
        <p>''When push comes to shove, their vote clearly shows that these Democrats are all for disclosure for their political enemies, but not for their big labor campaign contributors nor their political allies,'' said Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, who opposes the bill on the grounds it violates constitutional free-speech rights.</p>
        <p>Advocates of bipartisan legislation to tighten the nation's campaign finance and disclosure laws expressed concern over the sharp party-line attacks traded over the issue today.</p>
        <p>''Any response to this problem needs to be even-handed and bipartisan,'' said Representative Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut. ''This base bill should be a good starting point, but we need to work toward a consensus and build a bipartisan solution.''</p>
        <p>Senator McCain, in a telephone interview, said he was disappointed by the committee's vote: ''My recommendation is to go back and if they can't agree on full disclosure, at least attack the Section 527's, the most egregious manifestations of campaign finance abuses.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain is to meet on Friday morning with House Republicans, including, Representatives Michael N. Castle of Delaware and Amo Houghton of New York, who drafted the bill passed today, to try to work out a compromise that can win a majority in both chambers.</p>
        <p>Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Gordon H. Smith of Oregon, both Republicans, have proposed their own broad-based political advocacy disclosure bill. Senate Democrats and Mr. McCain oppose it, in part because it does not cover corporations.</p>
        <p>''We're prepared to expand the scope so long as everybody is included,'' said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader.</p>
        <p>When the House bill comes up next week, probably on Tuesday, Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat on the Ways and Means panel, said the bare minimum should be addressing the shadowy political groups.</p>
        <p>''We can't clean up all the mess in the campaign finance system, but we should deal with the most horrendous consequences,'' Mr. Doggett said.</p>
