        <p>Privacy advocates asked Congress today to investigate the use of Internet tracking technologies by a White House Web site, saying the use of so-called cookies by the Office of National Drug Control Policy violated White House policy and might have been illegal.</p>
        <p>The advocates, the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington, and Junkbusters Corporation, which develops consumer protection tools, said the practice might have violated the Privacy Act of 1974.</p>

        <p>Privacy advocates asked Congress today to investigate the use of Internet tracking technologies by a White House Web site, saying the use of so-called cookies by the Office of National Drug Control Policy violated White House policy and might have been illegal.</p>
        <p>The advocates, the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington, and Junkbusters Corporation, which develops consumer protection tools, said the practice might have violated the Privacy Act of 1974.</p>
        <p>The groups also asked Congress for an audit of the advertising agency that placed the tracking devices to ensure that all the data collected about visitors to the drug policy office's Web site was deleted.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the White House said its drug policy office might have violated its privacy policy by using an advertising firm, DoubleClick, to use the monitoring software to measure which of the office's antidrug Internet advertisements were most effective.</p>
