        <p>THE Internet economy may allow consumers to leave their cars in the driveway as they shop online, but every time they point and click to buy something, a delivery truck will come to their door, adding to pollution on its way.</p>
        <p>Looking for another way to clean up the air, the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Coalition this week received a $262,000 grant from the Transportation Department to build a superclean prototype delivery van. Other project participants will kick in another $262,000 for the project, which should be completed by fall.</p>
        <p>The van will use a micro-turbine, a jet engine about the size of a beer keg, to turn a generator and charge batteries that will drive the wheels. An earlier effort, a battery-electric version, weighed 8,300 pounds. But 800 pounds were cut by removing most of the batteries and substituting the turbine, built by Capstone Turbine of Chicago, and a tank of compressed natural gas with which to run it. Turbines are cleaner and more efficient than internal-combustion engines.</p>
        <p>With a 30-kilowatt generator (about 40 horsepower) continuously charging the batteries, and an electric drive of 70 kilowatts, or 94 horsepower, the Hybrid CitiVan will reach 55 m.p.h. and travel 140 miles a day. The electric drivetrain will be built by the Solectria Corporation of Arlington, Mass.</p>
        <p>The van will by used by the United States Postal Service and then by Massport, the Massachusetts Port Authority.</p>
        <p>Capstone, whose turbines provide electricity for buildings, has already supplied several for buses. The technology is probably too expensive for private cars, experts say, but may be practical in commercial vehicles that run many more hours a day. And the turbines are far less expensive than fuel cells, another proposed power source for electric drives.</p>
