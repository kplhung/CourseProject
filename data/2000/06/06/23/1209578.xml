        <p>Embracing an approach to computing it once scoffed at, Microsoft unveiled a strategy today that will increasingly move its business away from the personal computer the company has championed since the mid-1970's.</p>
        <p>The company said it would retool its product line to shift the very focus of computing away from hardware devices and toward a new generation of Internet-based software allowing people to interact with data and one another whether they are using computers, digital cell phones or interactive televisions.</p>
        <p>William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, portrayed the long-awaited move as ''more ambitious than anything we've done'' adding, ''There is no Microsoft product that isn't touched by this activity.''</p>
        <p>The fanfare surrounding the announcement here today signaled that Microsoft considered the move as momentous as its decision in December 1995 to ''embrace and extend'' the Internet after being caught flat-footed by the rise of the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's subsequent integration of a Web browser directly into its Windows operating systems led to the antitrust case that has resulted in a federal judge's ordering the company split in two and imposing severe curbs on its business practices.</p>
        <p>But those restrictions have now been suspended while appeals proceed, probably for a year or more, lifting what Microsoft said would be a serious impediment to the strategy it announced today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates showed no signs of being intimidated by the antitrust case, saying the browser, which he called a ''universal canvas,'' would become the principal user interface for all interaction with a variety of new services.</p>
        <p>In demonstrations and videos, Mr. Gates and his top executives introduced what they portrayed as a vision of a new software platform -- called .NET -- in which users will be surrounded by a range of devices providing access to a universe of information, including business and personal data. ''It's not quite like the past where there was a single device that defines all of this,'' Mr. Gates said. ''There will be many different devices.''</p>
        <p>The strategy will involve repackaging some of the company's core products, like its Office software, as subscription-based services obtained over the Internet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates said the new products would be rolled out in increments beginning next year, when Microsoft plans to introduce a version of its Windows operating system to be called Windows.Net 1.0.</p>
        <p>He also demonstrated a natural- language interface that would permit people to interact with a machine via voice, handwriting or commands entered in natural human language.</p>
        <p>Paul Maritz, a Microsoft group vice president, said the overall effort would be ''a long march'' that could take a decade or longer.</p>
        <p>Microsoft emphasized that the centerpiece of its new approach would be an increasingly popular Internet standard, XML, that eases the automatic interchange of information.</p>
        <p>In each example the company tried to show how the data-sharing facility of XML would allow people who work and play together to share information like scheduling, homework, music and videos to collaborate seamlessly whether they were connected by PC's, cell phones or tablet computers -- notebook-sized devices that can be activated by pen, voice or keyboard, or read as books.</p>
        <p>One example of the power promised by the .NET world was a video scenario in which a family posed for a digital portrait while on a trip to the zoo. A child then transmitted the photo via his cell phone to his grandparents, who were watching television. Without leaving their couch they were able to view the image on the television set, and then, with a simple command using the remote control, they transferred the image to a nearby digital picture frame.</p>
        <p>The new strategy is striking because Microsoft's executives once strongly resisted the notion that the personal computer might be supplanted by competing products, from hand-held devices to set-top boxes to cell phones. In the mid-1990's the company was under assault from competitors like Sun Microsystems,  Netscape Communications and the Oracle Corporation, which were advocating an approach called network computing that would have moved processing power from the desktop to a centralized computer.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Microsoft's new view of computing calls for processing to be done everywhere, from the desktop to the cell phone to powerful network computers somewhere on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Microsoft took pains today to make the case that the new strategy would be inclusive rather than exclusive and that it would offer the new .NET services on competing platforms.</p>
        <p>''Are we a company that is going to suck everything up into itself?'' said Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's president, defending against critics who have challenged the company's strategy as being proprietary. ''Because of XML you can have a device on the Internet that does not run .NET software but through XML it can participate in .NET services.''</p>
        <p>But while he and Mr. Gates insisted that those services would be based on an open Internet standard, enabling users with non-Windows-based platforms like the Palm computer and Apple Computer's Macintosh to take advantage of them, the executives acknowledged that such users would be second-class citizens.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates said the ''richest'' interactions with the new .NET services would require the new Windows.NET operating system.</p>
        <p>And despite the vision the company sketched today with videotaped endorsements from executives of hardware and software companies like Compaq Computer, Dell Computer, Arriba, Loudcloud and others, there was skepticism among some industry analysts that Microsoft would be able to rapidly attract other software developers to its vision.</p>
        <p>''They're leading a parade and asking developers to come with them, but what happens if nobody joins?'' said David Readerman, a managing director at Thomas Weisel &amp; Partners, a San Francisco investment firm.</p>
        <p>But other industry analysts said they were impressed with the vision the company articulated.</p>
        <p>''This shows that despite all the problems they're dealing with in the courts they still have a vision of the future,'' said Walter J. Casey, a technology analyst at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Ballmer occupied himself with making the case that there was a workable business strategy in the array of new products he said the company would introduce as part of the .NET strategy.</p>
        <p>He said that the company would increasingly try to move to a subscription basis for selling its products but that the existing packaged software and royalty and licensing programs would continue for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>He outlined a series of Internet-based services the company is creating, including its MSN online service; a version of its Office software to be called Office.NET; bCentral, a Web portal offering services to small business; and a version of its Visual Studio development environment for software developers.</p>
        <p>The company hedged its bets only slightly during the day. Mr. Gates said that the bet on .NET was equivalent to the 100 percent bet the company placed on its shift to the Internet strategy in 1995.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ballmer said he was confident, but he realized that the strategy was still a gamble.</p>
        <p>''It's a bet I feel very confident about,'' he said. ''But it's a bet.''</p>
