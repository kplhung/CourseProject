        <p>Hatless in the heat and humidity that sent spectators cozying up to shade trees, 70-year-old Arnold Palmer took a different walk down memory lane yesterday.</p>
        <p>For the first time in 40 years he played a round of golf without using an Arnold Palmer club. Instead, he has signed on with Callaway, and experimented with many of the clubs on the practice tee this morning before going out to play in the Pro-Am portion of the Cadillac N.F.L.

        <p>Hatless in the heat and humidity that sent spectators cozying up to shade trees, 70-year-old Arnold Palmer took a different walk down memory lane yesterday.</p>
        <p>For the first time in 40 years he played a round of golf without using an Arnold Palmer club. Instead, he has signed on with Callaway, and experimented with many of the clubs on the practice tee this morning before going out to play in the Pro-Am portion of the Cadillac N.F.L. Golf Classic on the Senior Tour in Clifton, N.J.</p>
        <p>On the driving range, Palmer also revealed, ''I'm dating again.''</p>
        <p>His wife of 45 years, Winnie, died last November of abdominal cancer. But he said today that he was seeing someone, a longtime friend of Palmer and his late wife.</p>
        <p>''It was a very emotional time,'' Palmer said of Winnie's illness, adding that he was touched by the many tributes to his wife. Meanwhile, Palmer is recovering from prostate cancer surgery three years ago and a flare-up that sidelined him briefly last year.</p>
        <p>Palmer is obviously still enjoying the adulation he receives. He smiles and stops walking the fairway when he spots a man with a camera. He autographs a cap for a 10-year-old boy. A Cadillac dealer takes his wife onto the tee to shake hands with him.</p>
        <p>Still, he works. His partner for 30 years in golf-course designing, Ed Seay, said they are working on 72 courses around the world, including one in Thailand.</p>
        <p>Palmer has not won a senior event in seven years, and his charges come early, rather than late -- such as yesterday's birdies on three of the first four holes. He had six birdies that made up for the 9 he took on the fifth hole. He finished with a 72.</p>
        <p>Palmer reflected that becoming the most popular golfer in the world may have come at the expense of winning.</p>
        <p>''When I was still playing really good, I did something to my game to make it on the fairway and on the tee,'' he said. ''I stopped taking chances. It affected my overall play and that's when it became more of a social thing -- my game started deteriorating. I wish it didn't happen. It was in the late '70's. I didn't devote myself. I played a lot of events to enhance the senior tour.''</p>
        <p>He became a walking legend who stopped to shake hands. He also stopped to smell the azaleas.</p>
        <p>But Palmer is comfortable in that role. ''I've got the best caddie,'' he said of Beth Kaufman, who occasionally totes his bag. ''I've got the best clubs, best rooting section. All I've got to do is learn how to play.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Carolina tight end Brian Kinchen and Tennessee punter Craig Hentrich led the N.F.L. qualifiers into today's 18-hole event at three over par for the two days of the Pro-Am.</p>

        <p>THREE SHARE ST. JUDE LEAD: David Toms, David Peoples and Joe Ogilvie shot six-under-par scores of 65 in near-perfect morning conditions yesterday to share the first-round lead in the St. Jude Classic in Memphis.</p>
        <p>Peoples had his lowest round this year but missed a chance to take sole possession of the lead when he three-putted from 15 feet on his final hole.</p>
        <p>Toms, who won twice last year, matched Peoples with seven birdies and a bogey. Ogilvie had six birdies. (AP)</p>
        <p>ACE LIFTS TORRANCE TO LEAD: Sam Torrance, the European Ryder Cup captain, helped by a hole in one on the 179-yard 14th hole, shot a six-under-par 66 yesterday and took a one-shot lead after the first round of the European Grand Prix in Hexham, England. (AP)</p>
        <p>WOODS LOSES MAGIC TOUCH: Days after winning the United States Open by 15 shots, Tiger Woods lost his magic while toting a bag.</p>
        <p>Woods, wearing shorts and a golf shirt, sunglasses and no hat, served as a caddie for Jerry Chang, his former college roommate at Stanford, as Chang tried to qualify for the United States Amateur Public Links on Wednesday at the Black Mountain course in Henderson, Nev.</p>
        <p>Having the world's best golfer on the bag did not work for Chang. He missed one of the two qualifying spots after a two-round total of one-under-par 143. (AP)</p>
