        <p>After Jane Geddes made a hole in one, she figured that her day might be special.</p>
        <p>There was no way that Geddes expected to lead the McDonald's L.P.G.A. Championship after today's first round. At 40, without a victory since 1994, Geddes had already begun to prepare for life after golf. She has founded her own Internet company. She has reduced her playing schedule. Golf had become more frustrating and less fun, a signal to Geddes that it was time to focus on other things.</p>

        <p>After Jane Geddes made a hole in one, she figured that her day might be special.</p>
        <p>There was no way that Geddes expected to lead the McDonald's L.P.G.A. Championship after today's first round. At 40, without a victory since 1994, Geddes had already begun to prepare for life after golf. She has founded her own Internet company. She has reduced her playing schedule. Golf had become more frustrating and less fun, a signal to Geddes that it was time to focus on other things.</p>
        <p>But today at DuPont Country Club, Geddes looked like the player she was in her prime, when she won two major championships. There was the hole in one at the 17th hole, when Geddes hit a gorgeous 7-iron from 168 yards that landed a few feet from the hole, then disappeared into the cup. There was a beautiful par-saving chip at No. 4, when Geddes lofted the ball from 30 yards in front of the green, getting it to stop a foot from the cup. There was the birdie on her final hole, when Geddes hit a wedge from 84 yards to 6 feet, then made a solid putt to end an uplifting day.</p>
        <p>And when the day ended, there was Geddes, leading the second women's major of the year. Shooting a five-under-par 66, Geddes held a two-stroke lead over four players tied at 68 -- Pat Bradley, Betsy King, Tracy Hanson and Gloria Park.</p>
        <p>Was Geddes surprised? Of course she was. But no matter what happens during the next three rounds, she will remember how she felt today.</p>
        <p>''This might be the last day I ever lead a major,'' said Geddes, who won her two majors during the 1980's -- the 1986 United States Open and the 1987 L.P.G.A. Championship. ''That's what's making me smile. I'm out there thinking, 'Enjoy this day.' Who knows? Nobody knows.''</p>
        <p>Geddes proved today that she still knew how to play golf, on a demanding course where only 19 of 144 players finished under par. Her round included five birdies, the hole in one eagle at No. 17, and just two bogeys. With long and accurate driving, Geddes avoided the deep rough that could lead to deep trouble, and she thoroughly enjoyed the challenge.</p>
        <p>''You don't feel like you have to make a zillion birdies,'' she said. ''I generally play well when courses are tough and pars are good scores. It's great for the tour and great for people to shoot a zillion under, but that doesn't necessarily suit my game. When one-under is on the leader board, or two-under is on the board, it just seems easier to look at.''</p>
        <p>It was also easier for Geddes to look at her scorecard than it has been. She has only two top-10 finishes in 13 starts this year, and the last time she contended in a major was 1996, when she tied for third at the Open.</p>
        <p>The Internet company that Geddes founded is called Planesia.com., a site that helps streamline Internet shopping. Much of Geddes's time off the course has been put into her new business, but while she has enjoyed that challenge, golf has become more stressful.</p>
        <p>''The more pressure you put on yourself, the harder it gets, and there's where I've been the last few years,'' she said of her golf game.</p>
        <p>But today, Geddes made a conscious effort to relax. After starting at No. 10, Geddes was one over par after four holes when her caddie, Dan Saleb, told her that she was too tense. Geddes loosened up, and the hole in one, the third of her career, definitely helped.</p>
        <p>Even Geddes is not sure if she can remain in contention, but at least she has a chance to try. What would winning a major at this stage of her career mean to her? ''It would be over the top,'' she said, smiling. ''For me to when another major right now? Then I could quit.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>KARRIE WEBB, the world's No. 1 player, who is trying to win her third major, struggled to a one-over-par 72. Among other notable players, LAURA DAVIES, ANNIKA SORENSTAM, MICHELE REDMAN and SHERRI STEINHAUER all shot 70; PAT HURST and DOTTIE PEPPER had a 71; the defending champion, JULI INKSTER, and MEG MALLON shot 72; and NANCY LOPEZ shot 74. . . . CRISTIE KERR, No. 22 on the L.P.G.A. money list, withdrew because of illness.</p>
