        <p>My earliest memories of Los Angeles are the wisecracks of the old radio comedians. Fred Allen, as I recall, described this as ''a nice place to live, if you happen to be an orange,'' and Oscar Levant said that when you stripped away the tinsel here, you uncovered more tinsel.</p>
        <p>I formed an indelible picture of L.A. noir from Bogart and Bacall in ''The Big Sleep,'' Howard Hawks's sardonic, hard-boiled tale of spoiled rich girls, con men, gunmen and other rogues, which William Faulkner and others adapted from Raymond Chandler's novel. Later, on television, I watched Jack Webb, as the laconic Sgt. Joe Friday in ''Dragnet,'' probe the city's underbelly.</p>
        <p>More than anywhere else in America, Los Angeles has been defined by popular culture -- that is, by the entertainment industry, which is based, after all, in Hollywood. Most of us, even people who live here, carry show-business images of Southern California around in our heads. But they are mere fragments of reality, snippets of grainy black-and-white or gaudy Technicolor, and splicing them together into an accurate picture is a tall order.</p>
        <p>One might begin with the idea of the place. For several generations of Americans it has been a 20th-century Eden, a garden at continent's edge where almost anything seemed possible. Today much of it is a paradise defiled, spoiled by sprawl, smog and selfishness. Fires and mudslides, repeated riots and the Northridge earthquake have scarred landscapes and psyches.</p>
        <p>Splendors remain -- and not just the chicks on Melrose Avenue and the biceps boys on the beach at Venice. Contemplate the Santa Monica mountains at dusk, wade into the surf at Malibu, glide through the tunnel of lavender-blue jacaranda blossoms on Palm Drive in Beverly Hills in May and June or walk along the placid residential streets of Pasadena, past glorious Arts and Crafts houses by the brothers Charles and Henry Greene, set on broad lawns maintained only by heroic irrigation and the sweat of Mexican gardeners, and you will understand the lasting allure of this vast, inchoate metropolis by the Pacific.</p>
        <p>There are days when hibiscus, jasmine and oleander scent the air, and you imagine yourself in Grasse, the perfume town on the Riviera, as my wife, Betsey, did on our last visit. There are days when the air is so acrid with exhaust fumes that your eyes sting.</p>
        <p>Los Angeles has always traded in glamour and illusion, ephemeral merchandise that is here today and gone tomorrow, like movie sets and the sex appeal of leading ladies. ''The back lot was 30 acres of fairyland,'' wrote F. Scott Fitzgerald in ''The Last Tycoon,'' ''not because the locations really looked like African jungles and French chateaux and schooners at anchor and Broadway at night, but because they looked like the torn picture books of childhood, like fragments of stories dancing in an open fire.''</p>
        <p>Yes, this is a fairyland, the home of hype and hyperbole, and it was also the home of two of the important presidents of the latter half of the last century, Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan. Their libraries are nearby, Mr. Nixon's in Yorba Linda, where he was born, Mr. Reagan's in Simi Valley.</p>
        <p>Colonized in 1781, as El Pueblo de Nuestra Senora la Reina de los Angeles de Porciuncula, Los Angeles had but 102,479 people in 1900. A half-century later, it had 1,970,358 and by 1996 the city and the satellites that surround it, spilling over mountains and stretching out into the desert, were approaching 16 million. By 2025, demographic experts say, the region will grow by another six million people, roughly twice the present population of Chicago.</p>
        <p>Metropolitan Los Angeles already covers 34,000 square miles.</p>
        <p>Explosive growth is creating a radically different society. While the area's black and non-Hispanic white populations remain relatively stable, its Asian and Hispanic populations are skyrocketing. Drive down the streets in and around the center of the city -- yes, ye skeptics, there is one -- and you see signs written in a Babel of languages and alphabets: Korean and Hindi, Lao and Japanese, Thai and Vietnamese, Russian and Spanish and Portuguese.</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District is the nation's second biggest, after New York's, with 713,000 pupils; for 70 percent, English is a second or third language, if spoken at all. In the lifetime of most of those students, whites will be a minority in the city and in the state.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, Mayor Richard J. Riordan has made education his top priority. He succeeded last year in gaining control of the school board, but pushing through reforms has proved harder than building the new Staples Arena or landing the Democratic National Convention, which will take place there in August. The dropout rate in the district is twice the statewide average.</p>
        <p>As did immigrants in New York in the 20th century, newcomers give Los Angeles much of its kinetic energy. But they present tremendous challenges. For the foreseeable future, the region will need to build 25,000 new housing units a year, and partly because of the city's seemingly unstoppable expansion, the state needs 300,000 new teachers almost at once.</p>
        <p>Castles, Real and in the Air</p>
        <p>''People here are more insecure than most,'' said Allison Silver, the New Jersey-born opinion editor of The Los Angeles Times. ''They come here in search of new identities, and they sense that this place out at the end of the line is the last chance that they will ever get to reinvent themselves.''</p>
        <p>That has its good side and its bad side. When Tom Bradley was mayor, he said Southern California provided people with ''a place where they can be free, where they can do things they can't do anywhere else.'' Such as wearing purple hair or founding sects, both religious (like Aimee Semple McPherson's) and political (like the John Birch Society). They cut themselves loose from the restraints of tradition, obligation, even family.</p>
        <p>Not everyone makes it, and not very many who make it keep it. For every fabulous fortune, there are graveyards full of shattered dreams. So people don't hold back. If you have a body, you flaunt it; if you have money, you spend it. Buy a Bentley (and take it to the Bel Air or the Peninsula for lunch so people can see it) and build a narcissist's castle.</p>
        <p>Angelenos create and they innovate. They launch fads. Eccentricity reigns, as Ogden Nash observed: ''Yes, it is true, Los Angeles is not only erratic, not only erotic, Los Angeles is crotchety, centrifugal, vertiginous, esoteric and exotic.'' Carey McWilliams, who knew the place well, described it as ''a circus without a tent.''</p>
        <p>The zaniest zaniness of all is the city's love-hate relationship with its cars. ''Hand wash'' shops are everywhere. People drive two blocks to buy a loaf of bread; go slowly, exquisitely mad in freeway traffic jams and show up an hour and a half late (or a half-hour early) for dinner. Hertz feels compelled to warn those who rent its vehicles here, ''Unfortunately, many Californians are in a hurry and usually ignore yellow lights (and sometimes red lights).''</p>
        <p>In ''L.A. Story,'' Steve Martin had a hilarious go at the car culture, putting pedestrians in gas masks. He lampooned the city's mania for decaf, diets and nose jobs, its compulsive consumption and its linguistic primitivism. He made even the traffic signals speak Valley: ''Uh, Like, Don't Walk.''</p>
        <p>But nutty or not, the place still makes converts. Michael Karnow, a comedy writer, grew up in Washington, the son of a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and journalist, Stanley Karnow, and graduated from Harvard. Since he moved here nine years ago, he has become an improbable Jamba Juice junkie -- ''I have their number on my speed dial'' -- and guzzles power boost and wheat grass drinks ''to increase mental agility.'' He's into yoga and he's learning to surf.</p>
        <p>So Hard to Unify</p>
        <p>But with so many people panning for gold here, so many people from somewhere else, Los Angeles itself suffers from an identity crisis. It is not so much a city as a concatenation of cities, from Anaheim to Azusa and Cucamonga, as they said on Jack Benny's show. Now more than ever, under the pressure of demographic and economic change, it is hard to unify.</p>
        <p>The oil and aircraft industries have all but disappeared as bulwarks of the regional economy, and most of the formerly influential banks have been merged into out-of-town institutions. Even The Los Angeles Times, once a pillar of the city's civic architecture under the stewardship of the Chandler family, has been sold to the Tribune Company, a Chicago media conglomerate.</p>
        <p>These seismic shifts have weakened the city's power structure. Barry Munitz, president of the J. Paul Getty Museum, probably the pre-eminent local cultural institution, compared today's Los Angeles to a ball poised at the top of an incline -- stuck up there because of ''a lack of enough educational, artistic, civic, economic and social leaders ready to shoulder the burdens.''</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles Police Department, its once-mythic reputation in tatters, is struggling to eradicate rampant corruption. Already battered by evidence of officers' planting evidence, lying in court and shooting unarmed suspects, Chief Bernard C. Parks suffered an additional tragedy and humiliation recently when his granddaughter was murdered in the city his men protect.</p>
        <p>With expansion of the city's rudimentary subway system stalled, several sections of the city are studying the possibilities of secession.</p>
        <p>Some say that the vernacular architecture, indeed the only architecture, of Los Angeles is the ticky-tacky bungalow. But in fact this is a place full of architectural fascination, ranging from things that look exactly like what they are -- the Tail o' the Pup hot dog stand, an oversize stucco and sheet-metal wiener, and the Capitol Records tower, shaped like a stack of 45's -- to things that evoke a world that never was, like Mann's (formerly Grauman's) ornate Chinese Theater, whose like never graced the streets of Old Cathay.</p>
        <p>In the old downtown, along Broadway, which is as animated as the new downtown is sterile, stand the Bradbury Building (1896), chaste tan brick on the outside, lacy metalwork and skylighted sparkle inside, and the Grand Central Market (1917), a survival of the city's past, where the ethnic stew of its present simmers. Lawyers and construction workers, African- and Mexican- and Asian-Americans, crowd the aisles, buying tin toys and purslane and chop suey and (if they're smart) following the crowds to Roast to Go, which has been dispensing the city's best tacos since 1952 -- soft tortillas filled with hand-chopped pork (or hog maw or tripe, as you will) with hot red sauce.</p>
        <p>The Gamble House in Pasadena (1908), with its Japanese-influenced woodwork of unmatched elegance, is the Arts and Crafts masterpiece of the Greene brothers. Art Deco landmarks stand along Wilshire Boulevard, including the zigzag Moderne tower of the old Bullocks department store (1928). For the Public Library downtown (1930), topped with a gilded hand holding aloft the torch of truth, Bertram G. Goodhue adopted a more pared-down if richly allusive Deco style, and in the Textile District, Robert Derrah produced a streamlined Moderne icon for Coca-Cola (1937), a bottling plant masquerading as a cream-and-scarlet ocean liner, complete with portholes, gangways and a flying bridge.</p>
        <p>Frank Lloyd Wright did some of his best work in the hills and canyons on the north side of town. Two of his buildings are open episodically to the public: the low-lying Hollyhock House (1920), containing much of its original furniture, and the Ennis-Brown House (1924), a ''Mayan'' temple in patterned concrete block, clinging to a cliff overlooking the city, whose preservation has been the life's work of Gus Brown, a former labor union official.</p>
        <p>A pair of Viennese-born architects, Richard Neutra and Rudolph Schindler, created what we know as the California style. Neutra's Lovell House (1929), near the Ennis-Brown House, is a stack of gray-and-white steel-and-stucco planes jutting from a hillside, perhaps as good a modern building as California has. It remains a private residence, but the innovative little house that Schindler designed for himself in Hollywood in 1921, a series of rooms made of cheap, utilitarian materials (concrete, canvas, composition board) with sliding walls that open onto gardens has been turned into a museum house.</p>
        <p>Seminal Gehry Buildings</p>
        <p>Frank O. Gehry, the architect of the moment, triumphant in Bilbao, planning great things for New York, lives here and has done some of his seminal buidings here, starting with a minimalist Hollywood studio for Lou Danziger (1964) and continuing with the Dutch-gabled cottage in Santa Monica that he rebuilt in 1978 (what must the neighbors have said?), using plywood and chain-link.</p>
        <p>Flamboyant though he sometimes is, Mr. Gehry can also work almost anonymously. He turned a police department garage into the Geffen Contemporary, a highly successful branch of the Museum of Contemporary Art, with a simple series of baffles and platforms, and he opened the formerly dark and disorganized Norton Simon Museum into a sunny, free-flowing series of galleries. His Disney concert hall, some critics think, may well cap his career.</p>
        <p>But until the hall is completed, the building all Los Angeles wants to see is Richard Meier's Getty Center, a series of interconnected travertine and enameled aluminum pavilions on an isolated hilltop near the western end of Sunset Boulevard. From afar, it looks like a village on a Greek island; up close, it, too, evokes the mystique of an ocean liner. Different levels linked by railed gangways feel like different decks, and fountains project the sound of splashing water everywhere.</p>
        <p>About 1.75 million people a year visit the Getty, and many of them come just to see the gardens and the views. It is chic in certain circles in Los Angeles to say that the pictures aren't up to the building, but people who have bothered to look at them don't say that. Not people who like Masaccio and Mantegna, or F. X. Winterhalter, that sadly underesteemed portraitist of empire. Surely not students of Rembrandt, represented here by two of his most vibrant portraits. And van Gogh's ''Irises'' could seduce a stone.</p>
        <p>In Pasadena, the great names march with no less majesty through the halls of the Simon: Giovanni di Paolo, Bellini, van Gogh again (his best ''Mulberry Tree''), Cezanne, Klee; reaching a climax in Zurbaran's exquisite ''Still Life With Lemons, Orange and a Rose.'' It is one of the world's choice small collections. A mile or so away, in manicured San Marino, the Huntington Library offers great manuscripts, a Greene and Greene collection, thousands of roses and Gainsborough's famous ''Blue Boy.'' Some year soon it will place on view this continent's greatest assemblage of works by the English designer and polymath William Morris, purchased last year from a California collector.</p>
        <p>The biggest museum in town, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, is a work in progress, with a major building program incomplete. Only 36 years old, it has put together an encyclopedic collection of some 150,000 works of art, including an extensive group of German Expressionist paintings, but it of course cannot match the Getty's staggering finanical resources. The Museum of Contemporary Art, whose red sandstone headquarters was the Japanese architect Arata Isozaki's first American commission, has acquired more than 120 works in the last year in a bid to keep pace with its rival up north, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, which has spent $125 million in two years.</p>
        <p>Locals bemoan the fact that Los Angeles, almost alone among world-class cities, failed to mount a gala celebration of the new millennium. They decry the city's lack of a professional football team, which in the eyes of some puts L. A. behind Charlotte, Nashville and Jacksonville. And they complain about the teams the city does have, which lose so often that sports columnists call the city Loss Angeles. [This year's N.B.A. championship, won by the Lakers under the avuncular coach Phil Jackson, was the city's first title in 11 years.]</p>
        <p>The Hollywood Industry</p>
        <p>Of course there is always Hollywood. The city's most visible industry is film, its natural vocabulary melodramatic. From D. W. Griffith to Marilyn Monroe to Steven Spielberg, film has carried Hollywood values around the globe. Television joins in the pop culture wars, portraying an unreal world filled with youth, beauty and virility.</p>
        <p>Legions of gawkers flock to Hollywood Boulevard, hoping like the hicks in Nathanael West's memorable Hollywood novel, ''The Day of the Locust,'' to catch a glimpse of a celebrity. As the critic Shelley Fisher Fishkin writes in a forthcoming book, ''Landmarks of American Literature,'' these are people, ''cheated out of their dreams by the illusions Hollywood held out to them,'' for whom ''movies and the world that surrounds them are more real than life itself.''</p>
        <p>But the city need make no apology for its grander artistic life, even if New Yorkers and San Franciscans often talk as if culture in Southern California were confined to yogurt. Hollywood actors and directors do not often lend their talents to the legitimate stage in Los Angeles; many limit their work to the movies, and some prefer the London or New York theater. But there are exceptions. Last summer, stars like Donald Sutherland, Al Pacino and Kelly McGillis were seen at the Mark Taper Forum and Ahmanson Theater in productions of plays by Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt, O'Neill and Shakespeare.</p>
        <p>Not until the arrival in 1984 of Peter Hemmings, a gentlemanly English arts administrator, did the city have an opera company. Mr. Hemmings, 65, is retiring as general director of the Los Angeles Opera at the end of this season, to be replaced by Placido Domingo, who will carry the title of artistic director, as he does in Washington. He is bowing out with Francesca Zambello's eye-filling production of Benjamin Britten's mordant ''Billy Budd.''</p>
        <p>Though criticized for excessive caution, Mr. Hemmings nurtured the company through adolescence and lured some big Tinseltown talents, including the painter David Hockney and the director Herb Ross, to the Chandler Pavilion as designers and directors. And he did it on an annual budget of $20 million, compared with  San Francisco's $50 million and the Met's $170 million.</p>
        <p>Philharmonic's New Home</p>
        <p>The disconnnect between high culture and pop culture in Los Angeles has been most visible in the 10-year struggle to build the Walt Disney Concert Hall -- another fascinating swirl of titanium designed by Mr.  Gehry. The money has finally been raised, the foundations are going in,  and the Los Angeles Philharmonic is scheduled to take up residence in 2002. But except for the Walt Disney Company, none of the studios, whose executives make hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and very few of the stars contributed a single dime.</p>
        <p>Without the exertions of the city's No. 1 supporter of the arts, Eli Broad, who heads the SunAmerica company, the fund-raising drive might well have foundered. Mr. Broad (the name is pronounced to rhyme with ''road'') made his money on annuities, not movies, and he collects modern art.</p>
        <p>Conducted by the glamorous young Finn Esa-Pekka Salonen, managed by the highly regarded Deborah Borda, who resigned from the New York Philharmonic to come here, the Philharmonic plays 30 weeks in downtown Los Angeles and 12 weeks under the stars in the Hollywood Bowl in hillside Griffith Park. It ranks among the best orchestras in America, a worthy challenger to the traditional Big Five bands in Boston, Philadelphia, New York, Cleveland and Chicago. Musical life in the city deepened during the war years and afterward, when both Igor Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg lived here. The orchestra has had a long series of truly outstanding conductors, among them Otto Klemperer, Zubin Mehta and Carlo Maria Giulini.</p>
        <p>''There are fine high-culture facilties here,'' said Tom Werner, the producer, with his partner Marcy Carsey, of many of the most wildly successful situation comedies of the last decade. ''But it isn't really that sort of place. When I was growing up in Manhattan, when it rained on Saturday, my mother took me to the Metropolitan Museum. When it rained on Sunday, she dragged me to hear Leonard Bernstein's concerts. Here, it never rains on weekends.''</p>
