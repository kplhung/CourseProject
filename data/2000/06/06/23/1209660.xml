        <p>Costco, the national warehouse club, has abandoned its plan to build a large supermarket at West 55th Street and 10th Avenue in Manhattan and has sold the property to a developer, the buyer confirmed yesterday.</p>
        <p>Neighborhood groups had vigorously opposed the project, saying it would bring in too many cars.</p>
        <p>Jeff T. Blau, president of Related Companies, a real estate developer, said yesterday that his company bought the 55th Street lot from Costco last week, as well as a parking structure on 23rd Street between 10th and 11th Avenues that Costco had also planned to convert into a store. That plan was dropped because it did not conform to new zoning rules.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blau said the 23rd Street property would be developed as an apartment building. He said there were no plans yet for the 55th Street site.</p>
        <p>Costco had also hoped to lease space for a supermarket at the former site of the 14th Street Armory. Last month, several community groups and political leaders filed a lawsuit seeking to block the store, and yesterday, Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried's office said that it had learned that it was unlikely that the lease would go to Costco.</p>
        <p>Costco officials did not answer repeated requests for comment.</p>
