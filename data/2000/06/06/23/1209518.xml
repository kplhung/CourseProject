        <p>One of the main reasons Robert Rodat, screenwriter of 1998's ''Saving Private Ryan,'' decided to set his follow-up film during the American Revolution was that it was a period and a setting that movie audiences had not seen, at least not in many years, and not in such an epic, sweeping format.</p>
        <p>''For some reason, there haven't been a lot of films about the American Revolution, and I don't know why,'' Mr. Rodat said. ''I thought about it a lot lately. I think part of it may be the degree to which the Western mythology, beginning in the 1860's and coming right up to the modern day, became so dominant in American mythology. The Revolution doesn't tap into that classic American mythology; it feels more like an English conflict, with the wigs and people talking about principles.''</p>

        <p>One of the main reasons Robert Rodat, screenwriter of 1998's ''Saving Private Ryan,'' decided to set his follow-up film during the American Revolution was that it was a period and a setting that movie audiences had not seen, at least not in many years, and not in such an epic, sweeping format.</p>
        <p>''For some reason, there haven't been a lot of films about the American Revolution, and I don't know why,'' Mr. Rodat said. ''I thought about it a lot lately. I think part of it may be the degree to which the Western mythology, beginning in the 1860's and coming right up to the modern day, became so dominant in American mythology. The Revolution doesn't tap into that classic American mythology; it feels more like an English conflict, with the wigs and people talking about principles.''</p>
        <p>In ''The Patriot,'' directed by Roland Emmerich, Mel Gibson plays a South Carolina landowner who decides to sit out the war to protect his motherless brood but is eventually forced, by circumstances and the prodding of a patriotic son, to take up the musket. At 2 hours and 40 minutes, it is the most epic in scope of the three big movies set to open in time for the July 4 weekend, probably the most competitive of the summer. (The others are ''The Perfect Storm'' and ''The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle.'')</p>
        <p>This holiday promises to be particularly lucrative because it falls on a Tuesday. The long Fourth of July holiday weekend is always a major period at the box office, with big films often opening the previous Wednesday (''The Patriot'' opens on Wednesday, the other films on Friday) and running strongly through the weekend. But with the holiday on a Tuesday, there is a strong chance that the moviegoing will continue at a holiday pace for two extra days, providing a movie that opens the previous Wednesday with a full week of holiday weekend box-office steam.</p>
        <p>Mark Gordon, one of the movie's three producers (there were also three executive producers and two associate producers), said he remembered sitting down with Mr. Rodat, with whom he has worked on several films, right after the release of ''Saving Private Ryan'' and trying to decide what backdrop they would choose for their next project. ''Bob mentioned the American Revolution,'' Mr. Gordon said, ''and we both thought, yes, this was something that hadn't been seen in a while, something that would feel fresh.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodat and Mr. Gordon sold the idea for the film to Columbia Pictures and developed the screenplay over 18 months. Initially they thought they would use an actual historical figure (Francis Marion, the legendary Swamp Fox, who bedeviled British troops from the marshes of the coastal Carolinas), but eventually they turned their character into an amalgam of several guerrilla fighters from the Southern campaign, most particularly Andrew Pickens, who, like Mr. Gibson's character, had a large family and tried to stay out of the war.</p>
        <p>''I like watching big-canvas movies and I enjoy writing them, but the essence of a big-canvas movie has to be a tiny story,'' Mr. Rodat said. ''That's certainly what David Lean taught us. So I find when I'm writing a big, sweeping sort of screenplay, I am wearing two hats. I'm the miniaturist and the painter of the big canvas, all at the same time. I must write something that has scope and scale, but at the same time has that little human window that allows us to enter that big world.''</p>
        <p>A Nod to Wireless</p>
        <p>When executives from the French conglomerate Vivendi announced this week that they were purchasing Seagram and its Universal Studios, they hung their prospects upon the economic viability of the coming generation of wireless hand-held devices that many in Hollywood believe will be the entertainment industry's next big thing.</p>
        <p>Vivendi's device, called Vizzavi (as in vis-a-vis), is just one of many being developed in hopes that people will very soon be able to connect to the Internet from wherever they are, without phone lines, to download music, video games, short films, television-like programs and even, some think, feature films.</p>
        <p>''I think it's absolutely true that wireless is going to be big,'' said John Hegeman, who has long straddled the worlds of the Web and the movie industry, first helping put together Internet marketing campaigns for films, including last summer's ''Blair Witch Project,'' and now as a partner with Joe Roth, a former Disney executive, in Distantcorners.com, an Internet entertainment site aimed at young science-fiction and horror fans.</p>
        <p>''But I'd say it's going to be something more like a radio or a portable television set than a portable movie theater,'' he said. While Mr. Hegeman said he could certainly see people whipping out their hand-held devices to watch a five-minute short, or check the news, or send e-mail, he had a harder time imagining that many people would want to watch big Hollywood movies on something that could fit into their hand.</p>
        <p>Whatever the results, there is certainly growing ferment in Hollywood over how the Internet will affect the way movies are distributed. This is, of course, a matter of some concern to those who have based their strategies on the long-established way of doing things, in which movies are first released in theaters and only then sent out to subsidiary venues like television and videotape. Will the Internet somehow threaten the primacy of the theatrical release?</p>
        <p>In part to bolster this theatrical primacy, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences issued a statement this week clarifying its rules about what films are eligible to compete for the Academy Awards, making it clear that only those films that have their first showings in a Los Angeles movie theater can compete.</p>
        <p>''The board just wants to make it crystal clear so that in the rush to embrace new technologies, a legitimate theatrical motion picture doesn't inadvertently jeopardize its eligibility,'' said Bruce Davis, the academy's executive director.</p>
        <p>In other words, if Universal or any other studio decides in the future to release a film initially on the Internet -- perhaps to show off some new technological advance -- the film will be treated in the same way as one shown for the first time on television.</p>
        <p>In response, IFilm, one of the leading companies offering streaming video on the Internet, scrambled and put together a deal with the AMC theater chain to allow some of Ifilm's shorts to be shown to paying audiences for three consecutive days in a Los Angeles cinema before being released on the Web. This is all that is required to qualify for the Oscars, said IFilm's chairman, Kevin Wendle.</p>
        <p>The official 73rd Academy Awards booklet will be sent to members in early August. If you want to mark your calendar, nominations for films released in 2000 will be announced on  Feb. 13 and the Oscar ceremonies will be, once again, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on March 25.</p>
