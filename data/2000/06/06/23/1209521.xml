        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>BEIJING OPERA COMPANY. This is probably not the sort of thing most people have in mind when they head for Atlantic City, and all credit to the Sands Hotel for venturing into the rich but still exotic world of Chinese opera, which continues to make substantial inroads in the West. This variety of the genre, with its magnificent costumes and crack acrobatics and martial arts, should divert even the most luckless gambler. There is also a free exhibition of Beijing Opera costumes open to all. Tonight at 10 and tomorrow night at 9, Sands Hotel and Casino, Indiana Avenue and Brighton Park, Atlantic City, (609) 441-4137. Tickets: $28 to $68 (James R. Oestreich).</p>
        <p>''CARMEN.'' The first production of the Opera Festival of New Jersey is Bizet's ''Carmen,'' one of the most popular operas ever written. But this inventive company, which performs only in the summer at the McCarter Theater at Princeton University, has more unusual fare in store for later in the season, including Hugo Weisgall's ''Six Characters in Search of an Author'' and ''Burning Light,'' by  Frank Lewin, a Princeton native. ''Carmen'' features Suzanna Guzman in the title role, Gerald Powers as Don Jose and Kristopher Irmiter as Escamillo. Michael Ching conducts and Elizabeth Bachman, in her festival debut, is the stage director. Catered dinners are available for picnics before the performances on the grounds of the Princeton Theological Seminary. McCarter Theater, 91 University Place, Princeton, N.J. Tonight at 8. Tickets: $24 to $82. Tickets, information and directions: (609) 258-2787 (Anthony Tommasini).</p>
        <p>''THE CORONATION OF POPPEA.'' Monteverdi's great final opera, ''The Coronation of Poppea,'' works well in English translation for American audiences. The story is a shocker, and the intrigue in the court of the Emperor Nero is fascinating. Hearing the dialogue in one's native language can certainly enhance the dramatic immediacy. The Connecticut Early Music Festival presents the 1643 work in English, in a fully costumed, semi-staged production directed by John Metz at Harkness Chapel on the campus of Connecticut College. This is the one opera where the ''bad guys'' (Nero and the conniving Poppea) win, having  vanquished their political opponents, the law and morality. Harkness Chapel at Connecticut College, 270 Mohegan Avenue, New London, Conn. Sunday at 6 p.m. Tickets: Reserved seats, $20; general admission, $15. Information: (860) 444-2419 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>''FALSTAFF.'' The bass-baritone Mark Delavan has impressed critics and audiences at the Glimmerglass Opera festival and the New York City Opera for his vocally splendid and dramatically vivid portrayal of Verdi's Falstaff. This native of Morristown, N.J., will sing the role this summer season with the Opera Festival of New Jersey, a production that opens tomorrow night. The strong cast includes Victor Benedetti as Ford, Juliana Rambaldi as Alice Ford, Jonathan Boyd as Fenton and, in her company debut, Kristen Plumley as Nanetta. Willie Anthony Waters conducts. McCarter Theater, 91 University Place, Princeton University, N.J. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. Tickets: $24 to $82. Information and directions: (609) 258-2787 (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>''RIGOLETTO'' AND ''MADAMA BUTTERFLY.'' This summer is the 34th consecutive year of the Met in the Parks, the Metropolitan Opera's popular free series of operas in concert performance. This weekend the traveling company goes to New Jersey, starting tonight at Brookdale Park in Montclair, N.J. A highly touted Hungarian soprano, Georgina Lukacs, will sing the title role of ''Madama Butterfly,'' with Paul Charles Clarke as the callow American naval lieutenant B. F. Pinkerton. Julius Rudel is to conduct. Verdi's ''Rigoletto,'' which opened recently in Central Park with a fine cast led by Carlo Guelfi in the title role, will be presented tomorrow night at Cooper River Park in Pennsauken, N.J. Nello Santi conducts. ''Madama Butterfly,'' Brookdale Park, Montclair, N.J., tonight at 8. ''Rigoletto.'' Cooper River Park, Pennsauken, N.J., tomorrow at 8 p.m. Free (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>BALTIMORE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA. The music of Shostakovich suddenly abounds everywhere, but Baltimore especially seems primed to become a mecca now that Yuri Temirkanov has taken over as music director of the orchestra. Mr. Temirkanov is a thorough master of the composer's symphonies, as New Yorkers know particularly from his indomitable accounts of the Seventh over the years. Here he offers one of the finest, the 13th (''Babi Yar''), to poetry by Yevgeny Yevtushenko, who is to be on hand to read and discuss his work before the performances. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, 1212 Cathedral Street, Baltimore, (410) 783-8000. Tickets: $22 to $57 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC. There are few better places in the city to hear chamber music than on this barge floating on the East River, with its live, intimate acoustics and its spectacular view of Lower Manhattan. Good weather will only enhance the experience, and the performances are often as fine as the setting. Here, in programs coordinated by Toby Hoffman, a violist, he is joined by other performers, including Peter Nagy, a pianist, and Charles Neidich, a clarinetist. The big piece tonight and on Sunday in a Mozart program is the Clarinet Quintet; tomorrow, it is Schumann's Piano Quintet, with works by Bach and Gyorgy Ligeti. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, and Sunday at 4 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-4061. Tickets: $27; $25 for the elderly; $15 for students (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>CARAMOOR. Set on a large estate with beautifully kept gardens and some extremely quirky architecture, Caramoor is one of the more pleasant locations for outdoor summer performances. The 55th season of the festival opens tomorrow evening at 7 with Peter Oundjian conducting the Orchestra of St. Luke's with the cellists Yo-Yo Ma and Edward Arron as the soloists. Mr. Ma and Mr. Arron open the performance with a Vivaldi Concerto for 2 Cellos (RV 531), as a kind of curtain-raiser to Mr. Ma's performance of the sumptuous Elgar Cello Concerto. The program closes with Stravinsky's ''Firebird'' Suite. During the weekend the pianist Misha Dichter is to offer a recital of the Romantic works that have become his specialty. Included on the program are Beethoven's Sonata No. 7, Schumann's ''Faschingsschwank aus Wien,'' two Scriabin Etudes, Prokoviev's Sonata No. 3 and a closing group of Rachmaninoff Etudes and Pre ludes. On Sunday at 4:30 p.m., with a pre-concert interview an hour earlier. Caramoor, Katonah, N.Y., (914) 232-1252. Tickets: Tomorrow night's concert is sold out, but returned tickets may be available; the Sunday concert is $25 and $35 (Allan Kozinn).</p>
        <p>HUDSON VALLEY CHAMBER MUSIC CIRCLE. The Orion String Quartet, which recently played all the Beethoven quartets in New York, seems to be weaning itself from the composer's music. Here it settles for his Quartet in E minor (Op. 59, No. 2), along with Wynton Marsalis's First Quartet (''At the Octoroon Balls'') and Mozart's Piano Quartet in E flat (K. 493). The pianist in the Mozart is Blanca Uribe, a fine performer born in Colombia. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Olin Hall, Bard College, Route 9G, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (914) 338-1172. Tickets: $20; $15 for the elderly; $5 for students (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>MAVERICK CONCERTS. This enterprising chamber music series, now in its 85th season, offers concerts in an open-sided barn where the sounds of nature and the music of man interact freely. Generally it offers programs on both Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons, but its season is still gearing up: this week it is presenting a single concert by the Broyhill Chamber Ensemble, which is to play works by Dvorak, Shostakovich and Frank Bridge. Sunday at 3. Maverick Concerts, Maverick Road, one mile from the junction of  Routes 28 and 375, West Hurley, N.Y., outside Woodstock. (914) 679-8217 Tickets: $15; $5 for students. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>Dance</p>
        <p>DANCE 2000: FELICE LESSER DANCE THEATER.

Tonight through Sunday at 8 p.m. Tickets: $20. Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street; (212) 334-7479 (Jennifer Dunning)</p>
        <p>DOUG ELKINS DANCE COMPANY.

        <p>OPERAWORKS. The promising young choreographer Ryan Kelly has created the dance for Igor Stravinsky's ''Nightingale,'' part of an operatic double-bill program by Operaworks that also includes Vaughan Williams's ''Riders to the Sea.'' Tyler Udall, like Mr. Kelly a member of the New York City Ballet, is to perform.
