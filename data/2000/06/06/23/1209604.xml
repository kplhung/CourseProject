        <p>Matt Ghaffari's 18-month-old son, Jake, shifted anxiously in his father's arms Wednesday night, looking like a gumdrop wedged between Ghaffari's hulking shoulder and proud chest.</p>
        <p>Everything about Ghaffari, starting with the bald pate glistening atop his 6-foot-4-inch, 286-pound frame, is big. He engulfs people with his passionate personality. He dreams in sweeping panoramas, talks in motivational-length speeches. Cries in waterfalls.</p>
        <p>That was the enduring image -- at least the initial one -- of Ghaffari at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. The Iranian-born Greco-Roman heavyweight who moved to Paramus, N.J., at 15 stood on the podium feeling as if he had let down the United States. The silver medal hung around his neck, a tarnished reminder, while his nemesis, the Russian Aleksandr Karelin, stood above, grinning in gold again.</p>
        <p>Ghaffari did not disappear with his second-place medal, though. Instead he took it with him everywhere -- visiting the bombing victims of Atlanta's Centennial Park in the hospital the next day; appearing on ''The Tonight Show'' four times -- promoting wrestling as he stretched his 15 minutes of fame into days.</p>
        <p>Now it is years. At 38, having had 17 major surgeries on knees and elbows and taken nearly two years off to provide money for his family, Ghaffari is back to make his third and final Olympic team and erase one image. He has never beaten Karelin in 23 matches, nor has any other wrestler in international competition. Ghaffari wants to be the first, sending the indomitable Russian into retirement with one defeat.</p>
        <p>Before he can do that, Ghaffari has another dream to realize, one that would place him in the spotlight in his largest venue yet. ''I have big ambitions,'' Ghaffari said today. ''I want to carry the flag into the Olympic stadium.''</p>
        <p>Even as Ghaffari spoke, he realized that he was marching ahead of himself. He must first make the Olympic team at these United States Olympic wrestling trials.</p>
        <p>Today, he took his first step, defeating his protege, 18-year-old Paul Devlin, of Livingston, N.J., 7-0, in the second round of the Greco-Roman heavyweight challenge tournament. ''O.K. One down, two to go,'' Ghaffari said afterward, ''four from Olympic team.''</p>
        <p>The summer after Ghaffari won his silver medal, Devlin attended his wrestling clinic at Edinboro (Pa.) University. ''I saw him as this big celebrity,'' Devlin said. ''He became my mentor. Ever since I met him, he was like a dad. He would always introduce me to people as his student. He was very personable, he was not above it all.''</p>
        <p>Ghaffari knows there are some who do not believe that and disprove of his promotional bent. Today, he appeared in his red-and-black singlet, with a passel of logos of sponsors and friends: Nascar to the mat.</p>
        <p>''I'm trying to teach the young wrestlers,'' he said. ''If you're a softball player, you have shoes, bats and contracts. It doesn't matter what sport you are, you have to sell it. It can help my kids; the young kids have a chance to compete with the world. More money, more medals, that's the bottom line.''</p>
        <p>After the Olympics, Ghaffari scrambled for money to support his family that grew from one daughter to three when his twins were born in February 1997 and expanded with Jake a year later.</p>
        <p>He has taken out three mortgages and four home-equity loans, and for one year he worked as an assistant coach at his alma mater, Cleveland State, for a $16,000 salary. Ghaffari briefly tried working as a talk-radio host, but found employment giving motivational speeches and working for the Brennan Financial Group in Cleveland as a financial consultant.</p>
        <p>He does work now for an Internet company, GlobalAxxess.com, which paid to fly him, his four children and wife, Amy, to the trials.</p>
        <p>''The majority of the guys want to learn how to do it,'' he said. ''I tell them you can be your company spokesperson. William Shatner is a spokesman for Priceline.com. A wrestler could have done that.''</p>
        <p>Ghaffari spoke after his match today because he is seeded second in his weight class and did not have the luxury of a bye until Saturday. Rulon Gardner does. Gardner, 28, is the unknown first seeding, having beaten Ghaffari, 1-0, in the rubber match in April's national championships. If Ghaffari wins his two matches tomorrow, the two will meet in the two-of-three finals on Saturday.</p>
        <p>The more Ghaffari talks, especially about Karelin, the more it motivates Gardner. ''It helps you get up for the match,'' Gardner said. ''You see the way he acts. I don't act that way. It's great for him; he won't shy away from anything.''</p>
        <p>Then he added, ''I'd hopefully like to be known for the way people think of Americans.''</p>
        <p>So does Ghaffari. ''I'm just trying to prove to everybody I'm the best representative this country has,'' he said. He came out of retirement after the 1997 world championships in which the Greco-Roman wrestlers did not earn a medal. When he returned, Ghaffari placed second at the 1998 worlds. To Karelin.</p>
        <p>Ghaffari knows he cannot lose focus. ''It's harder to get up for matches, especially for guys you've beaten,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In 1998, he narrowly defeated his opponent in today's quarterfinal, Billy Pierce, in overtime to get to the world championships. Ghaffari reminded himself today that he is one loss from finishing his Olympic career, unfulfilled. ''At this tournament, everybody is tough,'' he said. ''Everyone is Karelin for me.''</p>
        <p>Championships in New York</p>
        <p>USA Wrestling's executive director, Jim Scherr, confirmed Thursday night that New York City would play host to the 2001 world wrestling championships, an early victory for a city hoping to win the 2012 Olympics. Finals are tentatively set for Madison Square Garden on Sept. 30.</p>
