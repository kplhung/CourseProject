        <p>The preparations have begun for John Rocker's visit to Shea Stadium next week, and the Mets are taking some unprecedented measures to protect the confrontational Atlanta Braves reliever.</p>
        <p>The Mets have already installed tall black fences on two sides of a section of bleachers in left field, obscuring fans' views of the mounds and bench in the Braves' bullpen. The Mets also plan to add a plywood roof over the mounds -- a screen is always there -- and a canopy over the bullpen bench, which normally has no covering.

        <p>The preparations have begun for John Rocker's visit to Shea Stadium next week, and the Mets are taking some unprecedented measures to protect the confrontational Atlanta Braves reliever.</p>
        <p>The Mets have already installed tall black fences on two sides of a section of bleachers in left field, obscuring fans' views of the mounds and bench in the Braves' bullpen. The Mets also plan to add a plywood roof over the mounds -- a screen is always there -- and a canopy over the bullpen bench, which normally has no covering. There will also be a significant police presence along the left-field line and in the Braves' bullpen and dugout.</p>
        <p>''We feel confident that the very large majority of our fans will behave appropriately, and that they will voice their displeasure but won't do anything that is inappropriate or illegal,'' said Dave Howard, the Mets' vice president for business and legal affairs.</p>
        <p>''But you have to protect against the lowest possible denominator. You have to protect against that fringe element that may get carried away.''</p>
        <p>Howard said the Mets took some of these security measures last October during the National League Championship Series. Rocker was a controversial figure then, but his inflammatory comments in a magazine interview last December -- and a series of incidents since then -- have caused the Mets to increase security for the four-game series beginning next Thursday.</p>
        <p>''It's just being supplemented and augmented because of the emotional nature of this visit,'' Howard said.</p>
        <p>There is always a police presence at Shea; before last night's game against Philadelphia, five uniformed officers stood on either side of the field during pregame festivities. But once the game begins, the police leave the dugouts.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said there would be 450 to 500 police officers at the park for the series compared to a normal complement of 45.</p>
        <p>''We certainly don't have any police in the dugout'' in an ordinary game, Howard said. ''That would be unique.'' When the Mets play host to the Yankees next month, Howard said, police officers will be in the adjoining photographers' box.</p>
        <p>For the Braves, ''there will be an extensive police presence throughout that whole area, both uniformed and undercover,'' Howard said, referring to the area from third base dugout to the left-field bullpen. ''Their mission and goal will be to ensure that people behave themselves, that they don't step over the line, even with their verbal comments. We'll be taking a no-tolerance policy.''</p>
        <p>Mets first baseman Todd Zeile has seen violent interactions between fans and players; when he played for the Chicago Cubs in 1995, a fan charged pitcher Randy Myers on the mound at Wrigley Field. The fan, who was drunk, ended up wrapped in a Myers headlock and slammed to the ground.</p>
        <p>Zeile said there was always the chance something dangerous could happen, but he was hopeful that fans would distract Rocker only with words.</p>
        <p>''He offended people with words,'' Zeile said. ''The fans, I think, have every right to let him know what they think. That seems to be distracting enough for him. Fans can get under his skin with words the same way he did -- with words.''</p>
        <p>Zeile, who often rides the No. 7 train to Shea Stadium, was skeptical of Rocker's plans to take that train.</p>
        <p>''The only reason he would even bring that up is to attract more attention to himself,'' he said. ''That's exactly what he says he's trying to avoid.''</p>
        <p>Looking at Bordick?</p>
        <p>The Baltimore Orioles were expected to discuss shortstop Mike Bordick with the Mets soon, and the Orioles planned to look at Eric Cammack, a closer at Class AAA Norfolk.</p>
        <p>The Mets, who learned Wednesday that shortstop Rey Ordonez would need season-ending surgery on his broken left forearm, are interested in Bordick. They are also evaluating their interest in Orioles starter Scott Erickson, a 10-year veteran who will have five years of service as an Oriole in a week or so and can then veto a trade.</p>
        <p>But Erickson has not pitched well this season, and with three years left on his contract, the Mets may deem him too risky. The Dodgers right-hander Darren Dreifort is a far more attractive option for the Mets, and a major league official said yesterday that Dreifort was available.</p>
        <p>The Mets are interested in Kansas City left-fielder Johnny Damon, a left-handed hitter and proven lead-off man who would be perfect in their lineup. But while the Royals would listen to offers, they are not trying to trade Damon, said their new general manager, Allard Baird.</p>
        <p>Damon is eligible for arbitration this winter and the Royals want to re-sign him. They are not planning to negotiate an extension until after the season.</p>
        <p>''As far as shopping him or saying we're looking to move him, I can assure you, I have not done that and I will not do that,'' said Baird, who also has no intention of trading shortstop Rey Sanchez.</p>
        <p>One shortstop who could emerge as a candidate for the Mets is Rich Aurilia of the Giants. Aurilia is a New York native and was originally signed for Texas by Omar Minaya, who is now the Mets' assistant G.M.</p>
