        <p>Dr. Howard Rosen, a New York orthopedic surgeon who helped introduce the technique of mending broken bones with metal plates to American operating rooms, died on Sunday at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. He was 75 and lived in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The cause was cancer, his office said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rosen's association with the Hospital for Joint Diseases at New York University began in 1948, and since 1978 he had been the chief of its problem trauma service. He was an attending surgeon for the department of orthopedic surgery, which serves both N.Y.U. Medical Center and the Hospital for Joint Diseases.</p>
        <p>He had also remained in private practice and was a clinical professor of orthopedic surgery at New York University School of Medicine and Mount Sinai School of Medicine.</p>
        <p>In 1960, during a visit to the Cleveland Clinic, Dr. Rosen learned about osteosynthesis, a medical procedure that joined the ends of a fractured bone by metal plates and screws. He then went to Davos, Switzerland, and took a course in the method.</p>
        <p>In Davos, he met a manufacturer of the repair devices and bought basic instruments and implants, which he brought back to New York. From then on, he began treating the most difficult fractures, which were often referred to him by other specialists.</p>
        <p>He trained generations of orthopedic surgeons in the techniques and lectured in this country and overseas. He wrote 15 chapters of medical textbooks and scores of articles in professional journals.</p>
        <p>A native of New York, he graduated magna cum laude from N.Y.U. in 1944 and received his medical degree from the school three years later. He completed his internship and residency in orthopedic surgery at the Hospital for Joint Diseases.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rosen is survived by his wife of 46 years, Constance; two daughters, Terry and Aileen Rosen, both of Manhattan; and three grandchildren.</p>
