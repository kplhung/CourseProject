        <p>The head of the Justice Department's campaign finance unit has recommended that Attorney General Janet Reno appoint a special counsel to investigate Vice President Al Gore's political fund-raising activities during the 1996 presidential campaign, government officials said today.</p>
        <p>Robert J. Conrad Jr., who heads the agency's campaign finance team, told Ms. Reno in a meeting late last week that new evidence had revived questions about whether Mr. Gore had been truthful to investigators about his fund-raising activities. Mr. Gore has been questioned five times under oath, most recently in a four-hour interview on April 18 at the vice-presidential residence.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors were dissatisfied with Mr. Gore's answers during the interview, which was conducted in a far more confrontational manner than previous sessions had been, the officials said. At times, Mr. Gore reacted angrily to the questions, which covered an array of issues related to his fund-raising.</p>
        <p>Of the interview, one official said: ''It was sure as hell a different approach. It was real confrontational and put him on the spot.''</p>
        <p>The inquiry has rekindled a long-running internal battle in the Justice Department over the issue and, according to several current and former officials, has pitted Mr. Conrad against powerful advisers to Ms. Reno. Among them is Lee J. Radek, the head of the unit in the Justice Department that investigates public corruption.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conrad, several current and former Justice Department officials said, has expressed frustration over what he views as resistance from his superiors in the Justice Department. The officials said that Mr. Conrad had been told to avoid putting his views in writing and at times felt stymied in his efforts to communicate directly with top officials.</p>
        <p>Politically, the resurgence of an issue that had seemed to be running out of steam could not come at a worse time for Mr. Gore, who has been trying to reinvigorate his presidential candidacy. The reemergence of campaign finance problems could hobble the vice president with legal trouble and provide a potent weapon for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican nominee, who has vowed to make Mr. Gore's fund-raising a central issue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, campaigning in Minnesota today, was asked by a reporter whether he knew about the special counsel's recommendation. ''You're privy to news I don't have,'' he said, seeming a bit startled by the question.</p>
        <p>James F. Neal, Mr. Gore's personal lawyer, did not return calls placed to his law office in Nashville.</p>
        <p>At the White House, James E. Kennedy, a vice-presidential spokesman, said his office had ''received no word from the Department of Justice about the reported campaign finance development.''</p>
        <p>''As you know, the vice president has cooperated fully with the investigation every step of the way,'' Mr. Kennedy said.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department spokesman, Myron Marlin, declined to comment today on the matter.</p>
        <p>''The campaign finance task force has been investigating irregularities in the 1996 election cycle since 1996,'' Mr. Marlin said. ''That investigation is still ongoing and has prosecuted 25 people to date. It is inappropriate to comment on ongoing matters or internal deliberations.''</p>
        <p>So far, there is no indication that Ms. Reno has reached a decision on Mr. Conrad's recommendation. In 1997 and then again in 1998, she would not appoint an independent counsel to investigate Mr. Gore, over the objections of F.B.I. Director Louis J. Freeh and several senior Justice Department officials.</p>
        <p>The rules have changed since then. In place of the independent counsel law, which expired in 1999, the Justice Department has adopted regulations that give Ms. Reno the sole authority to appoint an outside prosecutor if she determines that her department would have a conflict of interest in an investigation, or if she decides that an outside inquiry is in the public interest.</p>
        <p>The resurgent inquiry is focused on several issues that the Justice Department has investigated for years. These include a fund-raising appearance by Mr. Gore at a Buddhist temple in California in 1996; fund-raising coffees for campaign donors at the White House; and whether Mr. Gore was truthful when he told investigators he was unaware that fund-raising telephone calls he made from the White House in 1995 and 1996 were intended to raise both soft money, for general campaign purposes, and hard money, for specific re-election expenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conrad is the fourth lawyer to head the Justice Department's Campaign Financing Task Force. In late December, he replaced David Vicinanzo, a former New Hampshire prosecutor. Mr. Vicinanzo succeeded Charles G. LaBella, who had repeatedly and unsuccessfully pressed for the appointment of an independent counsel in 1998 and quit in frustration. Laura Ingersoll was the first task force leader.</p>
        <p>From January 1992, Mr. Conrad had been a federal prosecutor in Charlotte, N.C., where he was the chief of the office's criminal division. He has prosecuted a variety of criminal cases, including public corruption, white-collar fraud, money laundering, organized crime and drug-trafficking cases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conrad would not discuss the matter today. In testimony before a Senate panel on Wednesday, he was asked whether he had discussed the appointment of a special counsel related to Mr. Gore or the questions that he posed to Mr. Gore in the interview.</p>
        <p>''The matters that I inquired into on April 18 are pending matters,'' he replied. ''I don't feel at liberty to discuss the subject matter of the examination.''</p>
        <p>On Capitol Hill today, Republican lawmakers welcomed the call for a special counsel. But Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, called for an inquiry into the timing of the ''leak'' about the special counsel recommendation. ''It is standard Justice Department procedure during a national election to stand down,'' Senator Torricelli said in an interview tonight. ''It raises some questions about the integrity of the entire process.''</p>
        <p>The investigation has remained a highly confidential matter in the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Freeh, who has long urged an independent investigation of Mr. Gore, has met privately in recent weeks with lawmakers in the House and Senate to avoid being asked to appear as a witness.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeh, whose relationship with the White House and with Ms. Reno has eroded badly over the issue, told the lawmakers that he did not want to be drawn into a public discussion of a pending inquiry, and that he did not want give the White House further cause for complaint. F.B.I. officials would not comment on the matter today.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno's refusal to appoint an independent counsel to investigate campaign finance has proven to be one of the most controversial issues of her tenure. Republicans have at times demanded her resignation, accusing her of trying to protect the White House from a politically perilous inquiry. House and Senate committees are continuing to investigate the matter.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, the controversy has resurfaced with the release of memorandums from Mr. Freeh and Mr. LaBella in which they urged the appointment of an independent counsel.</p>
        <p>Although the vice president attended the fund-raising event at the Hsi Lai Temple on April 29, 1996, investigators did not ask him about it until the April 18 interview.</p>
        <p>The event, a luncheon attended by about 100 community leaders, became one of the first important campaign finance controversies to embroil the vice president. It is unclear what Mr. Gore has told investigators about the event that has drawn renewed scrutiny. In public statements, Mr. Gore at first said the event was community outreach, not fund-raising. Later he said it was ''finance related.''</p>
        <p>An official with knowledge of the interview today said that Mr. Gore had also been asked about more than 100 coffee sessions held at the White House to reward past donors. Mr. Gore insisted in the interview that the coffees had not been fund-raisers, an official said today.</p>
        <p>The event at the temple was not among the subjects the Justice Department was investigating in late 1997 when Ms. Reno first considered seeking an independent counsel to investigate Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno instead pondered a single question: Did 45 fund-raising phone calls that Mr. Gore had made from his White House office violate an 1883 civil service law that barred elected officials from using government offices to raise donations covered by federal election law?</p>
        <p>Over Mr. La Bella's and Mr. Freeh's strong objections, Ms. Reno concluded that Mr. Gore's actions had been lawful. ''Evidence found by the investigators shows that the vice president solicited only soft money in these calls, not hard money,'' she said. Soft money donations fall outside federal election law.</p>
        <p>The next year, campaign finance prosecutors focused on whether Mr. Gore had lied to investigators in the initial inquiry into his fund-raising phone calls. Most of Ms. Reno's advisers, including Robert S. Litt, an  influential political deputy at the department, urged her to appoint an independent counsel. But again, Ms. Reno declined to do so.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conrad's aides are continuing to investigate whether Mr. Gore lied when he insisted that he did not know the difference between regulated ''hard money'' and unrestricted ''soft money.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore had repeatedly told investigators that he believed his White House telephone calls were only used to raise soft-money donations, which are not limited by campaign law. But a belatedly disclosed fund-raising memo by David M. Strauss, a deputy chief of staff to the vice president, suggested to investigators that in the 1997 inquiry, Mr. Gore might not have been truthful about what he had known about his phone calls.</p>
        <p>According to the memo and other recently released documents, the former White House chief of staff, Leon A. Panetta, and three other witnesses recalled that the hard money/soft money breakdown was discussed at a meeting where Mr. Gore was present. Ten or eleven other participants in the meeting could not recall that discussion. Mr. Panetta also recalled that the vice president seemed attentive when there was a discussion of how money would be split among party accounts.</p>
        <p>In a 1998 interview with the F.B.I., Mr. Gore said he had often been inattentive to detail at fund-raising meetings and that he sometimes missed parts of them, notes from the interview show. He told the F.B.I. that ''he drank a lot of iced tea during meetings, which could have necessitated a restroom break.''</p>
        <p>An official with knowledge of the inquiry said that some investigators were ''punching holes in the iced tea defense.'' Another official said some F.B.I. investigators ''are really pushing the perjury stuff, because they are convinced he lied to them.''</p>
        <p>After the vice president's April 18 interview with investigators, Mr. Gore played down the significance to reporters, saying he was not a focus of the investigation. ''I answered every question,'' he said.</p>
