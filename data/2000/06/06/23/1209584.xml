        <p>Senate Democrats tonight abruptly forced the first vote of the year on their prescription drug plan, a politically potent issue on the campaign trail, but the measure was swiftly defeated by Republicans.</p>
        <p>The bill, which would lower drug prices for all Medicare beneficiaries, was rejected by a vote of 53 to 44. Two Republicans voted in favor of the measure; one Democrat voted against it.</p>
        <p>At a time when public opinion polls show the rising prices for prescription drugs as a priority among voters, Senate Democrats seized on a parliamentary trick today to force a vote on their bill. In so doing, they accomplished two political goals: They got the chance to talk about their plan for making prescription drugs more affordable to senior citizens and they forced Republicans to cast a difficult vote, perhaps the only one of the year, on the issue.</p>
        <p>''When Medicare was passed, there was a fundamental commitment by the government to senior citizens,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who accused Senate Republicans of stalling on a bipartisan plan. ''Every day we fail to pass a prescription drug program, we are violating that commitment.''</p>
        <p>Republicans scoffed at the maneuver, calling it an unadulterated political stunt that was rushed, short-sighted and counterproductive. The prescription drug bill was brought up as part of a larger appropriations bill to provide money for the departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, and was allowed on the floor with no notice and with less than one hour of debate.</p>
        <p>''This is a politics-first amendment,'' said an outraged Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas. ''Nobody knows what it costs, how it works, what it does to the solvency of Medicare. This is politics at its worst. This body is offended by it. I'm offended by it. I don't think voters will be impressed by circumventing the process.''</p>
        <p>The Senate also voted to approve a contentious and heavily lobbied amendment to delay by one year federal regulations that would require employers to take steps to prevent repetitive motion injuries. The House already approved the measure.</p>
        <p>The amendment, which was bitterly contested by labor unions who want these worker protections as soon as possible, passed by a vote of 57 to 41, after Democrats spent the day filibustering the measuring.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration said it would recommend a veto of the spending bill if the measure is not removed. Business groups vigorously pushed to delay the regulations,  which would make the workplace ergonomically correct -- rules they say are too broad and too expensive and could cost employers, by their estimate, $60 billion a year.</p>
        <p>''This will have the most dramatic effect upon business and the economy ever promulgated by a federal agency,'' said Senator Tim Hutchinson, Republican of Arkansas. ''We are talking about $60 billion a year imposed upon the business community.''</p>
        <p>But the most surprising turn of events involved prescription drugs, which descended on the Senate seemingly out of the blue.</p>
        <p>For months, Democrats have accused Senate Republicans of stalling on the issue of prescription drugs, and some predicted today's vote could be the only Senate vote of the year on the matter.</p>
        <p>The Senate Finance Committee, whose chairman is Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, is working on a bipartisan bill that would address concerns about prescription drug prices. But Democrats say the committee is inching along and is unlikely to move at all on the issue this year.</p>
        <p>''Prescription drugs is a matter before the finance committee,'' Mr. Roth told Democrats on the floor. ''It is undoubtedly the most important domestic legislation that will be considered this year. Nothing will happen if we permit this legislation to become partisan.''</p>
        <p>House Republicans voted their own drug plan out of committee on Wednesday, but Democrats called it faulty, saying it should be better integrated into the Medicare system.</p>
        <p>Under today's Democratic bill, written by Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, drug insurance companies' premiums for Medicare beneficiaries would be $35 to $40 a month, the same as under the House Republican measure.</p>
        <p>The beneficiary would have to pay the first $250 a year in prescription drug expenses. The government would share costs beyond that amount, paying a larger proportion as drug expenses increased.</p>
        <p>Liberal Democrats signed on to the bill once Mr. Graham agreed to drop a provision that would have forced people with high incomes to pay higher premiums. Now, premiums will not be dictated by income.</p>
        <p>This is significantly different from the proposal offered by House Republicans. Under that plan, Medicare would pay half of drug costs from $250 to $2,100, but the patient would then be solely responsible for several thousand dollars of drug costs, and the insurer would not step in again until the beneficiary had incurred $6,000 of costs.</p>
        <p>''It is clearly a part of modern medicine today,'' said Senator Charles S. Robb, Democrat of Virginia, referring to the drug plan. ''It is not a luxury.''</p>
