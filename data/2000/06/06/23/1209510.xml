        <p>Mallett, the 135-year-old London antiques dealer, recently snared a major collection of neo-Classical English furniture from an American Anglophile who decided to ''repatriate'' his antiques.

The collection includes works by Robert Adam (1728-1792), the architect and designer of country houses in England and Scotland; the royal cabinetmakers Mayhew &amp; Ince (circa 1770); and Matthew Boulton (1728-1809), a lesser-known designer who was called the ''master of English ormolu.''</p>

        <p>Auction houses may make a lot of news but they don't score all the coups in acquiring private collections to sell.</p>
        <p>Mallett, the 135-year-old London antiques dealer, recently snared a major collection of neo-Classical English furniture from an American Anglophile who decided to ''repatriate'' his antiques. They went on view in Mallett's Bond Street gallery last week in an exhibition titled ''The Age of Matthew Boulton: Masterpieces of Neoclassicism.'' The collection includes works by Robert Adam (1728-1792), the architect and designer of country houses in England and Scotland; the royal cabinetmakers Mayhew &amp; Ince (circa 1770); and Matthew Boulton (1728-1809), a lesser-known designer who was called the ''master of English ormolu.''</p>
        <p>The consigner wants to remain anonymous, said Lanto Synge, chief executive of Mallett. ''We've known him for a long time,'' he said. ''For the past 30 years he has acquired from us, at auction and all sorts of places. He is an industrialist who is approaching retirement. He has been very discerning, even persnickety. He built up a collection of superlative standards and condition. Now he is having a change of direction.''</p>
        <p>The collection includes a pair of torcheres that Adam supplied for the Earl of Bathurst, the first owner of Apsley House in London, which was donated to the Duke of Wellington after he defeated Napoleon. Adam designed the interiors of Apsley House, now open to the public.</p>
        <p>The exhibition reminds visitors how neo-Classical taste goes in and out of style. As Mr. Synge put it, ''It seems to have come in waves ever since the Renaissance.'' After the discovery of Herculaneum in the 1700's, designers from England, France, Sweden and even America flocked to Italy for inspiration. Adam went to sketch temples, tombs, monuments and the walls of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Those motifs then showed up in his design repertory. ''Adam was the greatest Grand Tourist of them all,'' Mr. Synge said.</p>
        <p>Adam's George III giltwood and gesso torcheres and candelabra, from about 1780, are in the exhibition. They have triangular plinths on claw feet, with oval medallions depicting women in classical dress playing music. The corners have ram heads. Seated griffins are separated by a classical urn.</p>
        <p>Another Adam piece is a stand he designed for his friend George Keate. It is made of tulipwood and satinwood, to complement a precious 1711 Italian pietra-dura medals cabinet that Keate had bought in Rome. The small oak box has ebony veneers inset with colorful hardstone fruits and flowers. On the top, a toucan perches on a cherry branch.</p>
        <p>''There are very few miniature jewel-like boxes like this,'' Mr. Synge said, ''and we know Adam designed its stand because we found his drawing for this very piece in the Sir John Soane Museum.'' The museum has 9,000 Adam drawings, which Soane bought from Adam's daughters years after his death, when they desperately needed the money.</p>
        <p>The stand is in Adam's Etruscan style, with neo-Classical motifs on an ebony ground. Each side has a frieze with a pair of ormolu griffins flanking a vase. Beneath are ormolu laurel swags and bows. ''There was a big following for neo-Classical taste in the late 1700's,'' Mr. Synge said. ''But Adam was its grandest proponent.''</p>
        <p>Mallett is selling an equally neo-Classical George III roll-top desk attributed to the fashionable London cabinetmakers Mayhew &amp; Ince, contemporaries of Adam. The ladylike roll-top was made about 1775. The frieze on the front of the single drawer also has griffins, but they are done in penwork, on partridgewood panels. The tambour top has satinwood and yew bands decorated with inlaid wavy lines. The four tapering legs are decorated with zigzag, so-called shark-tooth marquetry. It was on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art until January.</p>
        <p>''Mayhew &amp; Ince probably invented the roll-top desk,'' Mr Synge said. ''There are two or three known, but this is the greatest one. It must have been inspired by the French cylinder desk.''</p>
        <p>He said he had unearthed some of the desk's history: ''It was acquired by Archibald, fifth Earl of Rosebery, and his wife, Hannah de Rothschild, of Mentmore, in 1875. Lord Dalmeny, Rosebery's heir, looked it up for us in the family records and found the bill -- it was $:500.''</p>
        <p>England was suffering through an agricultural depression at the time, and land prices had collapsed. ''The Roseberys took advantage of the dispersal of collections formed during the 18th century,'' Mr. Synge said.</p>
        <p>But the Earl of Rosebery (1847-1929) had his own financial concerns. Mr. Synge said he had insisted on inserting a proviso into the bill for the desk, which was an expensive piece of furniture even then. The earl was a famous horse breeder. He stipulated that he could forfeit the desk and return it if his racehorse did not win the English Derby that year. Fortunately for the cabinetmakers, the horse won and he paid his bill. Mallett is asking about $983,000 for the desk.</p>
        <p>Mallett is also selling 20 pieces by Boulton, a 19th-century engineer from the Midlands of England who was a pioneer in the development of early locomotives and made a fortune. At some point he decided he would design items like clocks and candelabra in bronze gilded to look like solid gold.</p>
        <p>Because Boulton was an engineer, not a classicist, his ''repertoire of ornament was drawn from books, models borrowed from other makers, plaster casts, other artifacts, architects, indeed from anywhere and anyone,'' Nicholas Goodison writes in the Mallett catalogue. ''He set out to rival the French bronziers.'' It is rare to have 20 pieces on display at one time, according to Mallett.</p>
        <p>One perfume burner has a plinth with a medallion showing an allegory of the death of Adonis. Beneath it, a mourning Venus and crying Cupid are putting out the Flame of Love, as a Dove of Peace looks on, perched on a quiver of arrows. Another piece, a clock, shows a gilded Minerva in armor and helmet, carrying a spear. The shield of Medusa rests at her feet.</p>
        <p>Boulton works can often be identified because he used local stones with his ormolu mounts. He especially liked Derbyshire ''blue john,'' a type of amethyst fluorspar. But the Boulton story has an unhappy ending. ''He tried to cash into the luxury market and ended up going bust,'' Mr. Synge said. ''But he did great work.''</p>
        <p>Proust Galleys</p>
        <p>The 52 long-lost galley sheets for Proust's ''Swann's Way,'' auctioned at Christie's in London on June 7, sold for $1,012,218, a world record at auction for a work of French literature. The buyer was the Martin Bodmer Collection in Switzerland.</p>
        <p>Felix de Marez-Oyens, director of Christie's international book department, said the manuscript was acquired for the Martin Bodmer collection at the Bibliotecca Bodmericana, a library in French-speaking Switzerland, which will make it available to literary scholars.</p>
