        <p>Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy announced a plan yesterday to speed up the licensing of nearly 600 uncertified teachers working in New York City's most troubled schools. But state education officials, who have simmered with impatience at the city's inability to staff those schools with fully qualified teachers, said that they were not yet ready to embrace the plan.</p>
        <p>The plan affects only the 585 unlicensed teachers who were hired last fall when the city could not find enough teachers to work in 99 failing schools known as ''schools under registration review,'' or SURR schools. In hiring those teachers, the Board of Education violated a new state requirement to hire only certified teachers at those schools. Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, has repeatedly warned that the uncertified teachers cannot continue working in the SURR schools next year without licenses.</p>
        <p>In a memorandum to the district superintendents, Mr. Levy said that the teachers would have to take state certification exams next month and participate in a summer training program that has yet to be developed if they wanted to keep teaching in SURR schools. Then, in the fall, the teachers would begin an alternative certification program at the City University of New York, which they would have to finish within two years. He acknowledged that the alternative certification program had  yet to be fully developed and approved by the Board of Regents.</p>
        <p>''This is not making it easier to become a certified teacher,'' Mr. Levy said in an interview yesterday. ''It's simply a different route to get there.''</p>
        <p>Alan Ray, a spokesman for Mr. Mills, said the Board of Regents would vote next month on whether to allow school districts to offer an alternative certification program -- one that allows aspiring teachers to compress the traditional menu of courses in teaching techniques. But the program would have to be rigorous and require up to two years of pedagogical coursework, he said. To participate in an alternative certification program, teachers would need a bachelor's degree in the subject area they planned to teach and possibly a 3.0 grade point average, Mr. Ray said.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Levy's plan for alternative certification ''appears to be consistent'' with the statewide program that the Regents are considering in response to the teacher shortage, state education officials have not yet seen the details, Mr. Ray said. So it is still unclear whether they will approve Mr. Levy's plan.</p>
        <p>''As long as it conforms to what the Regents are considering, it's fine with us,'' Mr. Ray said. ''But the commissioner has not approved anything yet.''</p>
        <p>The plan to eliminate uncertified teachers at SURR schools is supposed to be the first step toward eliminating unlicensed teachers throughout the system under guidelines adopted by the Regents in 1998 and 1999. New York City has the largest number of uncertified teachers, with roughly 11,000, or 14 percent of the total.</p>
        <p>This school year, 60 percent of the 9,000 teachers hired by the city were uncertified because so few licensed candidates were available. The Board of Education violated the new state policy prohibiting uncertified teachers in SURR schools out of desperation, Mr. Levy said.</p>
        <p>The pressure to increase the number of certified teachers comes as the city and the state face a serious teacher shortage. The union representing New York City teachers predicts that 14,000 of the city's 75,000 teachers plan to retire over the next 18 months alone.</p>
        <p>Vacancies most often occur in districts that have the greatest number of failing schools, like those covering Brooklyn's East New York and Brownsville neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said yesterday that if any of the 585 uncertified teachers affected by the new Regents policy did not take the certification exams in July and sign up for the alternative certification program, they could not teach in SURR schools next year. But those teachers can still teach in other city schools, he said.</p>
        <p>An additional 600 uncertified teachers now working in SURR schools are not affected by the new Regents policy, because they were hired before the 1999-2000 school year. Under state law, those teachers and other unlicensed teachers throughout the system have up to six years to get certified.</p>
        <p>Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, praised Mr. Levy's plan for alternative certification yesterday but said he should have released it sooner.</p>
        <p>''It's good because it averts a massive dislocation of teachers,'' Ms. Weingarten said. ''But to announce it a few days before school ends is not very respectful to these teachers. And ultimately it's not going to solve the massive long-term problem of finding qualified teachers.''</p>
