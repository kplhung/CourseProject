        <p>Susan Jaffe, who has just celebrated her 20th anniversary with American Ballet Theater, and a new partner, Carlos Molina, stepped into the leading roles of John Cranko's ''Taming of the Shrew'' on Monday night at the Metropolitan Opera House. They danced with fine spunk, in more ways than one.</p>
        <p>Mr. Molina, in fact, replaced Jose Manuel Carreno, whose injury, one of an unusual number suffered by members of the troupe this season, does not allow for all the acrobatic moments in Cranko's duets.</p>
        <p>Like Shakespeare's comedy, from which it is adapted, Cranko's ballet depends on the kind of intense rapport that Ms. Jaffe and Mr. Molina understandably have not yet developed. Nonetheless, their individual performances were vigorous and coherent. Ms. Jaffe's Katherina was an independent spirit tamed by Mr. Molina through three different duets and a series of pratfalls. Especially mean, her heroine was fierce in her attack. Kate's sister, Bianca, portrayed too much as a cipher by Yan Chen, was taunted aggressively by Ms. Jaffe. This assertiveness gave her duets with Mr. Molina a charged forcefulness that was enhanced by his superb partnering.</p>
        <p>Mr. Molina is still only in the corps, but he has distinguished himself in a variety of roles this season. If this major assignment left him too preoccupied with difficult partnering to concentrate on power in his dancing, his solos were still polished and his merry Petruchio in character. It was an outstanding debut.</p>
        <p>Vladislav Kalinin as Lucentio, Bianca's favorite suitor, and Ms. Chen had some awkward moments in their big pas de deux. But Mr. Kalinin's solos had an impressive classical style, imbued with a noble lightness. Herman Cornejo was too brilliant a dancer to play a fop (Hortensio): one can't help admiring the way he sails through the air. John Gardner as the doddering Gremio, Carmen Corella and Jennifer Alexander as the town whores, and Andrew Robertson as the priest, had the right comic spirit.</p>
        <p>Among the season's many injuries, tribute should be paid to those who have done extra duty. On Saturday afternoon in Antony Tudor's ''Jardin aux Lilas,'' Angel Corella was the forsaken youth, pining for the woman he loves. It was a perfect performance, full of suddenly released dynamics, expressing the emotional anguish of youth. Erica Fischbach as the abandoned mistress, should also be applauded: her dancing has amplitude and forcefulness, telegraphing her character's desperation.</p>
