        <p>Los Angeles is 2,780 miles west of New York City. Here is a sampling of attractions, along with travel information:</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>BEL AIR, -- 701 Stone Canyon Road, Bel Air, (310) 472-1211. Britain's Tatler magazine chose this as its Hotel of the Millennium, which is not far off the mark. The Bel Air never, ever lapses into Hollywood-style ostentation, creating instead the illusion that you're staying with rich, relaxed friends. Gardenias and birds-of-paradise bloom in 12 lush acres of gardens. Superb food on a terrace overlooking a swan-filled pond, and superb management by Frank Bowling. Double: $375 to $485.</p>
        <p>CASA DEL MAR, -- 1910 Ocean Way, Santa Monica, (310) 581-5533. Built in 1926, this was a favorite playpen of the stars in Hollywood's heyday. Flawlessly restored, it faces the Pacific across a broad beach near the Santa Monica Pier. Nothing here is commonplace. The 129 guest rooms, decorated in sherbety Mediterranean tones, are outfitted with wood-slatted Venetian blinds, VCR's and pictures in the vein of Matisse. Rubber duckies wait beside Jacuzzi tubs to soothe the road-weary. Double: $335 to $495.</p>
        <p>L'ERMITAGE, -- 9291 Burton Way, Beverly Hills, (310) 278-3344. Tucked into a residential neighborhood, L'Ermitage is sleek, serene and stylish after a four-year renovation. Guest rooms have three phone lines, plus a cell phone, 40-inch television set, DVD player and bar with free soft drinks; openwork sycamore panels slide shut to divide sleeping areas from dressing rooms and bathrooms. From the rooftop pool, you can see the Hollywood Hills -- sometimes. Double: $330 to $780.</p>
        <p>PENINSULA, -- 9882 South Santa Monica Boulevard, Beverly Hills, (310) 551-2888. Bentleys and Ferraris crowd the courtyard, and weird and wonderful people populate the lobby; this is a prime show-biz port of call. But even lowly folk get Frette sheets on their beds, oversize towels, breakfast served on Limoges china and still lifes of fresh fruit. The service never misses a beat, and the concierge desk works wonders. Order a Cobb salad to eat on the plane. Double: $395 to $450.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>CHINOIS, -- 2709 Main Street, Santa Monica, (310) 392-9025. This is the restaurant where I embellished my reputation as a pop-culture guru by failing to recognize either Gwyneth Paltrow or Brad Pitt. More important, it is where Wolfgang Puck, an Austrian, put California in a wok and begat dishes like Shanghai lobster with ginger curry sauce. After 16 years, the gold-faced Buddha behind the bar still surveys a noisy, well-fed crowd nightly.</p>
        <p>GINZA SUSHIKO, -- 218 North Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills, (310) 247-8939. This may be the most expensive restaurant in America; I don't know. I do know that the food is sublime -- full of pure, miraculously fresh flavors. Fugu, or blowfish, is potentially poisonous in the hands of lesser mortals, but in those of Masa Takayama, in this tiny, tidy room, it is poetry. Served only from November to March, it will set you back $400, with tax, tip and sake.</p>
        <p>LUCQUES, -- 8474 Melrose Avenue, West Hollywood, (323) 655-6277. An offshoot of Campanile, which is itself enjoying a deserved new vogue, Lucques is hot, hot, hot. In Harold Lloyd's old brick-walled carriage house, Suzanne Goin whips up hearty, satisfying dishes like a Technicolor salad of heirloom tomatoes and a bone-in rib-eye steak with reduced pan juices and a gratin of microscopically thin potatoes. Seth,, the head barman, mixes the town's best martini.</p>
        <p>MATSUHISA, -- 129 North La Cienega Boulevard, Beverly Hills, (310) 659-9639. From this unprepossessing little place grew Nobu Matsuhisa's worldwide empire. The sushi is perfect; notice the marbling of the pale pink toro and the subtle crunch of the fried soft shell crab roll. But innovative hot dishes made Nobu's name. So try the cod marinated for three days in miso, or the fabulous fried oysters bathed in a spicy, garlicky sauce. Go at off-hours, sit at the bar and order the Hoku Setsu sake.</p>
        <p>PHILLIPE, -- 1001 North Alameda Street, Los Angeles, (213) 628-3781. Phillipe (say fill-EEP-ay) sells a million French dip sandwiches a year to a motley cast of customers. The sandwich was invented here in 1918. Stand in line, shuffle your feet in the sawdust on the floor, order a twice-dipped beef with cole slaw and potato salad, both delicious, on the side. Then slather the sandwich with the house's hot house mustard and dig in.</p>
        <p>LA SERENATA DE GARIBALDI, -- 1842 East First Street, Los Angeles, (323) 265-2887. Reborn after two years of renovation, La Serenata is again the city's favorite Mexican haunt. Once a hole-in-the-wall, it now boasts handsome tiles, carved beams and bright textiles. The food remains light, authentic, greaseless and glop-free; vegetables in the fajitas, for example, are fresh and gently cooked.</p>
        <p>SPAGO BEVERLY HILLS, -- 176 North Canon Drive, Beverly Hills, (310) 385-0880. Wolfgang Puck's surprisingly unsnobby, unshowbizzy flagship has no weaknesses. Lee Hefter has shaped a winning menu ranging from authentic wienerschnitzel to sweet-corn agnolotti. Sherry Yard prowls farmers' markets for fruit in peak form for her succulently simple desserts (boysenberries and sugar-lipped peaches on our last visit). And Michael Bonaccorsi, possibly the best young sommelier in the country, springs surprises from California, Italy, France and Austria. Eat under the sky amid the trees in the courtyard if you can.</p>
        <p>VALENTINO, -- 3115 Pico Boulevard, Santa Monica, (310) 829-4313. Like my friend David Shaw of The Los Angeles Times, I know no better Italian restaurant in the United States, nor any better (and more fairly priced) wine list. Forget about the menu; put yourself in the hands of Piero Selvaggio, the suave, warmhearted, Sicilian-born owner. He will give you a taste of this and a sip of that: for instance, subtler bresaola and richer Chianti than you ever imagined.</p>
