        <p>WHAT makes a dancer stand out from the crowd? A dazzling technique helps, though multiple turns and high jumps are par for the course today. Beautiful bodies and appealing faces draw the eye.</p>
        <p>But stages are full of performers who fit the prescibed notion of physical perfection. There are so many dancers to claim the heart and mind and eye, yet only a few do each season.</p>
        <p>Ease, physical eloquence and quiet daring are common denominators among seven outstanding new or unfamiliar performers who will dance this weekend in New York, as well as the three former Alvin Ailey dancers whose new modern-dance troupe has made its debut this week at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in the Berkshires.</p>
        <p>All occupy the stage with a look of unassuming ownership. Each catches the eye with something more than skill or physical beauty, an often elusive quality that remains in the mind, like a flash of bright unexpected color on a bustling city street, long after the curtain falls.</p>
        <p>Take Hope L. Boykin, who performs with Philadanco at the Joyce Theater this weekend. Ms. Boykin would be the first to admit that she does not have a typical dance body. Compact and round, she was told for years that she would never become a dancer. Onstage, however, she is so fully engaged in every moment of dancing that the vibrant performing around her pales a little in comparison.</p>
        <p>Adam Hendrickson has a strong, often dazzling technique, but it is the undercurrent of sly subversiveness in his dancing that makes him fascinating. Janie Taylor, like Mr. Hendrickson a City Ballet corps dancer who is cast in major parts, brings a fugitive, synesthetic perfume to all that she dances.</p>
        <p>Michael Thomas scorched the stage with his quiet intensity during his years with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Elizabeth Roxas was a cool, still, lyrical center of the Ailey storm. And Karine Plantadit-Bageot's dancing was suffused with an understated wit. The three dancers see their new company RhythMEK -- a name formed in part from the first initials of their own given names -- as a response to their lives in dance.</p>
        <p>At American Ballet Theater, which seems to have more than its share of attention-grabbing young performers, four corps dancers stood out this season in a variety of roles.</p>
        <p>Sean Stewart is the rare classical dancer who is equally believable and committed-looking in modern dance and ballet. Like Mr. Stewart, Michele Wiles seems to extend and expand everything she dances so that the shape of a step or gesture and the line of her body and its rhythmic response to music look unbounded. Herman Cornejo brings out the fine detail in choreography without fussiness, his quick light attack making the most of every moment. And although Marcelo Gomes is Brazilian, he looks like the quintessential American classicist, a dancer who just dances, big and boldly, without a hint of ornamentation.</p>
        <p>How did they get where they are today? Each has a story to tell.</p>
        <p>Marcelo Gomes</p>
        <p>Marcelo Gomes, who has just been promoted to soloist, began his training at 6, studying jazz dance at a school in Manaus, in northwest Brazil, where he was born. ''I was always dancing around the kitchen and living room,'' said Mr. Gomes, who is 20. ''My parents thought dance classes would be nice as an activity thing.'' By 9, when he had begun training with Helena Lobato and Dalal Aschar in Rio de Janeiro, Mr. Gomes knew he wanted to be a ballet dancer. ''Not anything else, and that was that,'' he said, laughing. ''My family had been 100 percent there for me. Always, always.''</p>
        <p>He studied at the Harid Conservatory in Boca Raton, Fla., for three years before leaving for a year's study at the Paris Opera Ballet school on a Prix de Lausanne scholarship. ''I wanted to go there because of the great tradition and training. I learned French a little bit and ate some cheese.''</p>
        <p>He joined Ballet Theater in 1997. ''I love the repertory. I love the classical stuff, Petipa, everything about it. But contemporary ballet and modern dance is very important for a dancer. You have to be able to roll on the floor and then the next day become a prince.''</p>
        <p>Asked about his big, unadorned way of dancing, Mr. Gomes said that Brazilian dancers tend to be exaggerated about their technique but they also give their all. ''I do that,'' he said. ''Maybe the bigness is what Brazil gave me. In Paris, they cleaned me up. I felt so confident about my dancing afterward.''</p>
        <p>Even though he will not be repeating his performance of one of two major male roles in ''Etudes,'' Mr. Gomes recommends seeing the Harald Lander ballet on Ballet Theater's closing weekend at the Metropolitan Opera House, June 30 and July 1. ''If you really like ballet, it's a great way of seeing how ballet technique has developed.'' He is moved, he said, watching the journey from basic tendus or foot stretches to bravura dancing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gomes will be seen in Twyla Tharp's new ''Brahms-Haydn Variations'' on closing night, July 1. ''Twyla's stuff is very hard, even though it looks like we're having a hell of a time. Everything needs to be very precise in the big group. If we're not together, you can really see it. But it is enjoyable. You can get a lot from working with Twyla. And we're at the point now where we have fun with the ballet.''</p>
        <p>Herman Cornejo</p>
        <p>Herman Cornejo, also just promoted to soloist, began ballet at 8 in his native Buenos Aires, where he was accepted two years later into the Teatro Colon school. ''At first it was like a game, but when I got into Teatro Colon I knew that I loved to dance,'' said Mr. Cornejo, who is 19. ''I just loved the music.'' His first ballet hero was Maximiliano Guerra. ''I loved him. He jumped a lot.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cornejo, who himself has one of those dream jumps that seem to pause at the top and hover in mid-air, was spotted by Julio Bocca for his Ballet Argentina troupe. In 1997 Mr. Bocca entered his young dancer in the international ballet competition in Moscow, where he won a gold medal in 1995 in the senior category even though he was only 15. In 1998, Mr. Cornejo joined Ballet Theater, where his sister Erica, another promising newcomer, also dances.</p>
        <p>He will perform the Bronze Idol in ''La Bayadere'' on Saturday night. ''Wow, that variation is amazing,'' Mr. Cornejo said of his solo, a killer exercise in pyrotechnics. He may also be seen in the Tharp ballet.</p>
        <p>Sean Stewart</p>
        <p>Sean Stewart dances with the silken restraint and fastidiousness of English ballet classicism. His performing suggests that dancing is, for him, a great private pleasure that he is willing to share with his audiences.</p>
        <p>The unforced fullness of his dancing allows him to let the choreography grow and breathe with him on the stage, an ability he put to revelatory use this season as the Fourth Man in Martha Graham's ''Diversion of Angels.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stewart started training in ballet at 12 to improve his jazz dance technique. Dance -- both frequent performing as a child and the physical demands even classes made -- was an escape from problems at school in his hometown of Vacaville, in northern California.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stewart's face shines with that delight in the physicality of dance when he talks of the energy of ballets like ''Etudes'' and George Balanchine's ''Theme and Variations,'' in which he will dance next weekend.</p>
        <p>He moved to New York City at 15 to perform for two years with the Joffrey II ballet, the Joffrey Ballet's junior ensemble, then went to Paris for a year on his own to study at the Paris Opera Ballet school. ''I just wanted to see a different kind of training and work on my technique,'' Mr. Stewart, who is 21, recalled. Performing in Ballet Theater, which he joined in 1997, was ''kind of like a big fantasy, the place to be in.''</p>
        <p>Two other dreams are to dance Romeo and the slave in ''Le Corsaire.'' ''It's really soft and powerful,'' he said of the latter role, describing neatly his own look. ''And Romeo is so free, the character and the movement.''</p>
        <p>Michele Wiles</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Stewart, Michele Wiles started ballet training to improve her jazz dance technique. She still takes jazz classes to loosen up stiff muscles. Ms. Wiles enrolled at 10 in the Kirov Academy of Ballet in Washington. Soon after, dancing in a children's role in ''Swan Lake'' with the Royal Ballet of London at the Kennedy Center for the Peforming Arts, she knew she wanted to dance ballet professionally. ''I guess because the ballerina is put on such a pedestal,'' she said. Ms. Wiles, who has just been promoted to soloist, joined Ballet Theater in 1998.</p>
        <p>She will dance the third solo in the ''Kingdom of the Shades'' scene in ''La Bayadere'' tonight, tomorrow afternoon and on Tuesday. ''It's one of the most difficult variations,'' she said. ''So slow and controlled. You have to be right on your leg. And you can't make any mistakes. It shows.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wiles, who is 20, has won a number of jazz dance and ballet awards, among them a gold medal at the international competition in Varna, Bulgaria, in 1996. It takes aplomb to compete, and hers shows in all that she dances. She likes to become someone else on the stage, she said, and feel a part of a fantasy. But her primary goal is ''to give people a good show'': ''I want them to see how I'm enjoying myself. I'm happy in what I do. I don't even think about it, I just let my body do it.''</p>
        <p>RhythMEK</p>
        <p>''The truth is that I was bored altogether with what I was doing and what was out there for me,'' Karine Plantadit-Bageot said with a throaty laugh when asked why she helped to found RhythMEK. ''I was always very interested to see if dancers could actually collaborate and change the recipe around a little bit.'' Her sentiments were not unlike those of Michael Thomas and Elizabeth Roxas. All had performed with the Ailey troupe in the 1980's and 90's, leaving at the same time in 1998. All went on to perform freelance with other modern troupes, a ballroom company and on Broadway. Ms. Plantadit-Bageot is on leave from ''Saturday Night Fever.''</p>
        <p>The character of the company and its repertory evolved through endless get-togethers in the dancers' apartments. Ms. Roxas initially thought of a company for dancers over 40, but their ages ranged from 33 to 42. RhythMEK, it was decided, would show off its 12 dancers, who include the three founders and Desmond Richardson, Elizabeth Parkinson, Sarita Allen and Roger Bellamy. They would be seen initially in a suite of seven dances created by a wide range of choreographers. There is ballroom dance by Gary Pierce, Broadway dance from Bill Hastings, jazz dance by Mia Michaels and modern dance by Mr. Thomas, Zvi Gotheiner, Dwight Rhoden and Ulysses Dove, who will be represented by excerpts from ''Episodes.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Roxas said of Dove: ''He'd say that 'Episodes' was about relationships in the moment, and then move on to the next stage,'' Ms. Roxas recalled. That seemed peculiarly appropriate for RhythMEK. Collaborating with living choreographers has had its nervous moments, she added. But such collaborations were a part of the plan.</p>
        <p>''Could we actually do it?,'' Mr. Thomas remembered the three dancers asking themselves early on. ''It's one thing to be a dancer and totally another to be a director, especially when you're still dancing.</p>
        <p>''I've never worked so hard in my life. But this is ours, and it feels so good. We know who we are and no one is trying to prove anything.''</p>
        <p>Janie Taylor</p>
        <p>Janie Taylor began her ballet studies at 4 with Gilbert Rome in Houston, where she was born, and continued with Richard Rholden and Joseph Giacobbe in New Orleans when her family moved there. At the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet, where she trained in two summer sessions before enrolling full time, she was singled out as the 1998 recipient of the Mae L. Wien Award for promising students. That same year she joined City Ballet and soon attracted attention in challenging featured roles like Dewdrop in ''The Nutcracker'' and the doomed young girl in ''La Valse,'' both choreographed by Balanchine.</p>
        <p>She cherished the latter role. ''It's fun to do acting as well as the dancing,'' said Ms. Taylor, 19. ''And I get to die. It's so creepy, watching the ballet from the front.'' Ms. Taylor will be seen tonight in Peter Martins's new ''Harmonielehre,'' set to famously difficult music by John Adams. ''The partnering is really awkward, though my partner, Jared Angle, is amazing. Peter never really said anything to all of us about it, but it seems to be about three different worlds.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Taylor seems dubious when asked about her seemingly total confidence on stage. ''I know you should look like you're confident,'' she said. ''I always want to reach the audience, affect them somehow, on some sort of level.''</p>
        <p>Adam Hendrickson</p>
        <p>For Adam Hendrickson, dancing classical ballet has been more of an internal struggle. First there was the battle to come to terms with ballet after the ''boot camp'' experience of nine years at the Central Pennsylvania Youth Ballet, where Mr. Hendrickson, a native of Harrisburg, trained with Marcia Dale Weary. Next came the relatively relaxed but still difficult demands of the School of American Ballet.</p>
        <p>Does he feel himself a dark or subversive presence on the stage? ''Yeah,'' Mr. Hendrickson said, laughing. ''It's not so much the ballet that I like doing; it's the energy that it requires. A lot of my dancing is driven by anger rather than by love of it. It's not that I'm not happy. That's just what it takes to get me going. I was always told my body's terrible, and I have this whole short complex. I try to dance as big as I can.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hendrickson, who is 19 and is a corps dancer like Ms. Taylor, joined City Ballet in 1998. His sister Jessy, also considered promising, dances with the company, too. He suffered through the misery that hits new company members who have been acclaimed in school but now have few challenges in the corps. Then he began to get featured roles and was told by the company, though encouragingly, that he would have to clean up his dancing and make it more classically pure. Dancing the technically demanding role of Bluebird in ''Sleeping Beauty'' was his reward.</p>
        <p>Was there a moment when he realized he wanted to dance professionally? ''When it happens,'' he said, ''it's really weird. Dumb times, like when I almost get hit by a cab. I think, Oh my God, this is my body and that's what I use. My brain is almost worthless in my job. I'm carrying around my whole career with me. Other people can leave it in their computers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Martins's new ''Harmonielehre,'' he adds, does require an active brain. It is ''a cool ballet'' but difficult because of its complex score by John Adams: ''My calves are swollen from tapping my foot to the music in the wings,'' he said, laughing. ''Trying to hear the beat.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hendrickson will spend his week off, before City Ballet opens on July 5 in Saratoga, N.Y., teaching at the Central Pennsylvania Youth Ballet. He talks of Stanley Williams, a much-admired teacher at the School of American Ballet who died in 1997. ''I loved Stanley no end. I want to teach his way. If he hadn't been there, I wouldn't be here. And just the struggle I had keeping things up after he died that last year made me feel like I needed to go back home and teach there.''</p>
        <p>Hope L. Boykin</p>
        <p>Hope L. Boykin is, like Mr. Hendrickson, the rare dancer who loves to teach. It was not a skill she noticed much as a student in Nina's School of Dance in Durham, N.C., where she was born. She was just happy that she, a black child with her share of baby fat, was accepted as a dancer by Nina Wheeler, the school director, and her teacher Jennifer Potts. They encouraged her to go on to the American Dance Festival in Durham, where she trained on a work scholarship and came to know and be influenced by such choreographers as Pearl Primus, Talley Beatty and Donald McKayle.</p>
        <p>To calm her mother's worries about her interest in dancing, she enrolled in Howard University, where she majored in psychology before dropping out. ''I wanted to dance, but I didn't really know it,'' Ms. Boykin, who is 28, recalled. She began performing with the New World Dance Company in Washington and then came to New York.</p>
        <p>She landed a job with Mr. Rhoden's Complexions company where, dancing with Mr. Richardson, a dance hero of hers, she suddenly understood that she wanted a career in dance. ''I was just having a good time at Nina's,'' she said. ''At Ailey, I was just seeing how far I could get. Four pirouettes tomorrow instead of three today. But standing next to Desmond I thought: 'I can do this. I could live my life like this.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Boykin joined Philadanco, her first major dance troupe, six years ago. She will leave after the Joyce season to join Ailey, just in time for the Lincoln Center Festival. ''I learned so much at Philadanco,'' she said regretfully. ''There is no dancing like the dance there.'' Much of her life and those of other black performers of her generation will be reflected in the program in which she will perform. Called ''On the Shoulders of Our Ancestors,'' it pays tribute to pioneers like Mr. McKayle and Primus and Beatty.</p>
        <p>She attributes her look of being entirely present in the moment to her struggles to become a dancer. ''When you see something you like, take it, try to nurture it,'' Ms. Boykin said. ''Take everything you've learned and lay it on the line. I also pray for guidance before every show. I want people to know that it is not me but my Lord that has helped me overcome the obstacles.''</p>
        <p>She recognizes the same struggles in her students at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia: ''I know that times are hard for them. Dancers are a dime a dozen. You have to have your special thing. A lot of them can't finish school, or have been told they can't dance, that they are too heavy. I want them to know that if they really want this, it's theirs. They can give it away, but no one can take it from them. They made me know what I want to do after the dance is done.''</p>
        <p>Will these performers make it into the first ranks of dance? To be a professional dancer in a major company is to sink or rise with equal unexpectedness. Anna Liceica, a big-eyed and piquant ballerina who arrived at Ballet Theater via the National Ballet School in Bucharest, Romania, and the City Ballet, was surprised when she was summoned recently by Kevin McKenzie, Ballet Theater's artistic director.</p>
        <p>''It's nice of you to talk to each of your dancers during the crazy Met season,'' she told Mr. McKenzie. But he had not called her to his office for a chat, he said. Her heart sank. Was she about to be fired? But the news was good, though a total surprise. She was being promoted.</p>
        <p>''You work for it,'' Ms. Liceica said. ''It's your dream. But it's not going to change much. It's nice to be acknowledged, but now I'll work even harder.''</p>
