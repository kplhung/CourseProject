        <p>When Mike Tyson arrived at his hotel in downtown Glasgow on Wednesday evening, his affable Scottish hosts were too polite to protest.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the local rape crisis center had gone to court to bar Tyson's entry to the country; the one-year-old Scottish Parliament had petitioned to have his Saturday fight with Lou Savarese denied a license; and a poll of readers in the local newspaper -- where Tyson is continually referred to in print as ''the convicted rapist'' -- had made it obvious that an overwhelming majority of Scots did not welcome Tyson's presence.</p>
        <p>But when Tyson was finally here in this revived port city, there was the shrug of indifference, hiding perhaps an aggrieved disdain and a frustration tinged with nationalism.</p>
        <p>As a matter of immigration law in the United Kingdom, it was Jack Straw, the home secretary in London, who had the power to grant Tyson permission to fight in Scotland's national soccer stadium, Hampden Park.</p>
        <p>It was a decision that rankled some locales as the most recent example of England's flaunting its will over Scotland, and it eventually touched off a lengthy debate in the Scottish Parliament that devolved into the centuries-old debate about Scottish independence.</p>
        <p>The discussion is easily stirred up in Glasgow's streets and pubs, where the patrons acknowledge that Tyson's visit has everyone ''a wee bit off-temper.''</p>
        <p>Even if they are trying not to show it.</p>
        <p>''I think we all are very disappointed,'' said Mary Mulligan, a member of the Scottish Parliament and head of that body's education, sports and culture committee. ''To actually see somebody like Mr. Tyson brought here and put up as a sporting hero is unacceptable. Because of his prior conviction for rape and because he's not made any efforts to say he's sorry. It flies in the face of what we're trying to stand for. The people I talk with are all very uneasy about this.''</p>
        <p>Others are just plain perturbed.</p>
        <p>Peter Kelvin of Glasgow sized up the bevy of police officers and bodyguards surrounding the entrance to Tyson's hotel today as he worked to repave a nearby street.</p>
        <p>''Look at the security for one man in there,'' Kelvin said, scoffing as he nodded toward the hotel. ''Come on now; he's a boxer, not a royal.''</p>
        <p>And yet, at Hampden Park, where seating capacity for boxing is 51,500, nearly 40,000 seats, priced from $50 to $850, have already been sold. There were at least 40 people who cheered Tyson on Wednesday and called out for autographs. As in most places Tyson visits, there always seems to be some kind of a love-hate relationship.</p>
        <p>But there are theories to explain the huge expected gate as well. Some Scots believe it is the English fans who are buying up the tickets, turning Saturday's fight into an exhibition for out-of-towners in a revered Scottish sporting venue.</p>
        <p>''I don't know anybody who is actually going to buy a ticket,'' Mulligan said.</p>
        <p>Tyson, meanwhile, in an interview Tuesday with The Evening Times of Glasgow, likened himself to Scotland's national hero William Wallace.</p>
        <p>''I feel my situation has been very similar to his,'' the newspaper quoted Tyson as saying. ''Wallace was betrayed by nearly everybody he trusted, and in many ways I feel that is similar to my fate.''</p>
        <p>Today, in his only news conference of the week, Tyson was asked how he felt about those opposing Saturday's fight -- organizations like the Glasgow Rape Crisis Center, which plans a protest rally outside Hampden Park on Saturday night.</p>
        <p>''I love them,'' said Tyson, who later in the day donned a kilt during a public appearance and insisted that most Scots were supportive of him.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't matter if I can understand what they're saying,'' Tyson said, referring to Scottish accents. ''I understand their heart and their heart is with me.''</p>
        <p>But a week ago, there were protesters at the building that houses Glasgow's city government bearing placards and wearing T-shirts with the slogans, ''Tyson: Money Before Justice.''</p>
        <p>It was the promise of economic gain for city businesses that many Glaswegians consider the real reason that the fight, which was twice postponed, ended up in Glasgow. Some officials originally estimated that the local boon could be as high as $12 million.</p>
        <p>Few now believe -- even with Tyson's enormous entourage -- that Glasgow will see such a windfall. Still, the pursuit of profit with Tyson in the mix, irritated Sandy Brindley, the development officer at the Glasgow Rape Crisis Center.</p>
        <p>''That was particularly angering, that it came down to economic gain,'' Brindley said. ''Because we felt that was prioritizing economic concerns over the pain and the suffering women have experienced because of sexual violence.''</p>
        <p>Tyson's arrival in Glasgow is also oddly timed. Ten or 15 years ago, about the time Tyson was calling himself ''the baddest man on the planet,'' people were referring to Glasgow as one of Europe's roughest cities.</p>
        <p>Once the principal dropping point in the British Isles for American tobacco and cotton during the 17th and 18th centuries, Glasgow was later known for its lynchpin role in the Industrial Revolution. Scotland's biggest city with more than a million residents, it was also where, along the River Clyde, that the mammoth and fabled ocean liners Queen Mary and QE II were constructed.</p>
        <p>But by the early 1980's, the city's renowned Victorian architecture, and the prescient, ground-breaking work of a local architect, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, were enveloped in a blackening soot from years of smoking industrial buildup.</p>
        <p>A massive clean-up operation -- aimed at more than just the building exteriors -- was organized in 1983. The civic and cultural renaissance took root. It was designated the cultural capital of Europe in 1990 with more architectural and art awards following throughout the decade, recognition usually reserved for its eastern urban neighbor, Edinburgh.</p>
        <p>Today, Glasgow, built on blue-collar values, is also chic, vibrant and highly progressive.</p>
        <p>It is into this setting that Tyson has come, to earn a purse of about $8 million, bringing with him the controversy that has accompanied him wherever he goes for a decade. This time, in some measure, he has even spawned a nationalistic furor in a people to whom he would seem to have no connection -- Tyson's William Wallace analogies aside.</p>
        <p>But Mulligan, a member of the first parliament to sit in Scotland since 1707, does not see the discord Tyson's presence has provoked as another battle over national rights.</p>
        <p>''If people are unhappy, they should make that understood loud and clear to the home secretary in London,'' Mulligan said. ''But this isn't about borders; it's an issue of principle. This man is someone who shouldn't be allowed in Scotland, to fight in a sport's stadium, or to do anything else.''</p>
