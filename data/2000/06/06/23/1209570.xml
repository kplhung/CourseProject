        <p>A federal law intended to shield children from online pornography was dealt a second setback today, as an appellate court upheld a lower court order against its enforcement and declared that the statute was probably fatally flawed.</p>
        <p>Calling the case an agonizing conflict between the cherished right of free speech and the profound duty to watch over children, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit let stand an injunction issued by a federal district judge.</p>
        <p>The unanimous appeals panel in Philadelphia made clear that it saw a struggle not just between the First Amendment and a society's moral obligation to its young, but also a struggle to devise laws compatible with the Internet's instant access and global reach.</p>
        <p>In the end, the panel said, the 1998 Child Online Protection Act falls well short of meeting First Amendment standards, as the American Civil Liberties Union and other plaintiffs contended.</p>
        <p>''We will affirm the district court's grant of a preliminary injunction because we are confident that the A.C.L.U.'s attack on C.O.P.A.'s constitutionality is likely to succeed on the merits,'' the circuit court said.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department had appealed the district judge's injunction and declined to say tonight whether it would appeal today's ruling. ''We will review the decision and take appropriate action,'' a spokeswoman said.</p>
        <p>The protection act would require commercial Web sites to collect a credit card number or some other access code as proof of age before allowing Internet users to view on-line material deemed harmful to minors. First-time violators would face criminal penalties of six months in jail and $50,000 in fines. Repeat violators would face an additional $50,000 a day in fines. The law also provides for civil penalties of up to $50,000 a day.</p>
        <p>The law has never been enforced. Soon after it was passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton it was challenged by a coalition of 17 groups and businesses represented by the American Civil Liberties Union. The plaintiffs include a condom dealer, an online art site, a gay and lesbian online service and the Internet Content Coalition. The coalition consists of about two dozen publishers with online ventures, including Time Inc., MSNBC and The New York Times.</p>
        <p>The Child Online Protection Act was introduced in Congress after an effort to regulate children's access to Web pornography, the Communications Decency Act of 1996, was ruled unconstitutionally broad by the Supreme Court in 1997. The Supreme Court held, among other things, that the Communications Decency Act had not defined its key terms sufficiently, and noted that it was aimed not just at commercial speech and entities but at nonprofit organizations and individuals.</p>
        <p>Backers of the Child Online Protection Act argued that the latter law was far narrower, zeroing in on commercial Web-pornography traffickers and their ''teaser ads.'' Opponents of the law argued that it could be applied to high-minded Web ventures that carry sexually explicit material -- those dealing with gynecological issues, for instance.</p>
        <p>Judges Leonard I. Garth, Theodore A. McKee and Richard Lowell Nygaard praised the efforts by Congress to protect children. But turning to the concept of ''community standards'' of decency in defining pornography, they noted the virtual impossibility of a Web site meeting the standards of, say, Chicago, Amsterdam and Tehran at the same time.</p>
        <p>Today's ruling upheld District Judge Lowell A. Reed Jr. of Philadelphia who, as a father and grandfather, had expressed ''personal regret'' at having to issue an injunction against the child-protection act.</p>
        <p>The appellate judges said they shared his sentiments. They said, too, that ''in light of rapidly developing technological advances, what may now be impossible to regulate constitutionally may, in the not-too-distant future, become feasible.''</p>
