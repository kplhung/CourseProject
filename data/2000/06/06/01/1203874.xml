        <p>Road warriors who get that syncing feeling with their Palm organizers can now safely back up their data, even when there is no desktop in sight. JKS Technologie, a German company, has created the FlashPlug, a small device that adds 8 megabytes of storage.</p>
        <p>Palm owners have traditionally backed up data by syncronizing the unit with a desktop or laptop computer via a Palm cradle attached to it. FlashPlug users can connect the gadget to the Palm and back up files onto the unit with the device's file manager software.</p>
        <p>The lightweight FlashPlug does not require extra batteries and will run on the Palm operating system, version 2.04 or higher. It connects easily to most models of the Palm organizer, although the Palm V and Vx require an adapter. Storage space on the FlashPlug can also be partitioned. More information can be found on the FlashPlug Web site (www.flashplug.de). The FlashPlug costs about $120 and can be purchased in the United States from the PDA Life Web site (www.pdalife.com).</p>
        <p>The FlashPlug is also being promoted as a  storage drive for large Palm databases like files containing medical reference materials. (Files have to be copied back to the Palm before they can be used.) Better yet, the FlashPlug might  make room for the really fun stuff, like electronic texts, games, digital maps and graphic images, which are handy to have but are voracious space hogs when you have only a couple of megabytes of memory.</p>
