        <p>''Usually, I cry when I lose,'' Dominique Van Roost said through tears on her 27th birthday after beating Lindsay Davenport.</p>
        <p>It was a day for the unusual at the French Open. A day when a record 80 singles matches had to be crammed into the schedule at Roland Garros stadium to make up for the rain that washed out play completely on Tuesday. A day when the former clay-court masters Carlos Moya and Marcelo Rios were sent skidding out of the tournament in the first round. A day, above all, when Davenport, one of the two women who have dominated the game in 2000, was beaten by the unseeded but hardly unmotivated Van Roost, 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-3.</p>

        <p>''Usually, I cry when I lose,'' Dominique Van Roost said through tears on her 27th birthday after beating Lindsay Davenport.</p>
        <p>It was a day for the unusual at the French Open. A day when a record 80 singles matches had to be crammed into the schedule at Roland Garros stadium to make up for the rain that washed out play completely on Tuesday. A day when the former clay-court masters Carlos Moya and Marcelo Rios were sent skidding out of the tournament in the first round. A day, above all, when Davenport, one of the two women who have dominated the game in 2000, was beaten by the unseeded but hardly unmotivated Van Roost, 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-3.</p>
        <p>Davenport had not lost her opening match at a Grand Slam event since 1993, and she had a valid excuse in the injured back that forced her to withdraw from the Italian Open two weeks ago and began bothering her significantly again late in the second set today.</p>
        <p>''I really wanted to play here, and I gave it my best effort,'' Davenport said. ''You know that's bad timing and bad luck.''</p>
        <p>It was left to others to reinforce some order on the day. Venus Williams, who missed the first four months of the season with tendinitis in both wrists, fared better today, beating Jana Kandarr of Germany, 6-0, 6-3. The defending men's champion, Andre Agassi, also advanced, shrugging off three set points in his first-round match against the Frenchman Anthony Dupuis, winning by 7-6 (7), 6-3, 6-4. In the second round, Yevgeny Kafelnikov downed the Argentine Mariano Zabaleta, 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (8), 6-4, 6-4, Michael Chang defeated Thomas Johansson in four sets to earn a date with Gustavo Kuerten, and Mark Philippoussis, who beat Pete Sampras in four sets on Monday, eliminated the American Paul Goldstein.</p>
        <p>The second-seeded Davenport was gracious in defeat, conceding that Van Roost's spirited baseline play had a great deal to do with the outcome. ''It's a tough call to make about retiring or trying to play through it,'' said Davenport, who cannot recall retiring from any match. ''She was playing well. I could have been 100 percent healthy and still lost. You never know.''</p>
        <p>One month ago, Van Roost, distraught by the death of her mother, Louise Anne, from cancer on March 26, was not sure she wanted to play the game anymore. ''I was mentally struggling,'' she said. ''I had many questions going through my mind.''</p>
        <p>A former member of the top 10, her ranking dropped to 20 after early losses in Rome and Strasbourg, and her draw in Paris did not lift her spirits. ''I arrived here and said, 'Well, God is not really nice with me in this moment,' '' Van Roost said.</p>
        <p>But Van Roost's confidence and game plan began to evolve. Like Davenport, she does not particularly enjoy playing on clay, but she knew that if she could get enough first serves in play and keep the Californian off balance by mixing flat, deep groundstrokes with drop shots she had a chance. By the time the match reached its critical phase, with Davenport moving gingerly and wincing on most shots, Van Roost's chances had grown immensely.</p>
        <p>Not that the slender Belgian was in perfect shape herself. She received treatment for cramps in her right forearm and legs three times in the final set. ''I must admit that I could see she was not moving all that well, but I was not moving very well at the end either,'' Van Roost said.</p>
        <p>The question now is whether Davenport will be able to move well enough to defend her Wimbledon title. ''One thing about losing so early is that now I have a lot of weeks,'' Davenport said. ''Normally there's only two weeks before Wimbledon; now I've got three and a half. I think that will be enough. But obviously grass represents another challenge for backs.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to walk out in my first match at Wimbledon thinking, 'I can win this thing,' '' she added. ''Unfortunately, here, that wasn't the mind-set coming in.''</p>
