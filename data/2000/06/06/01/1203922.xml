        <p>Vice President Al Gore called today for legislation that would require health insurance companies to provide children with mental health benefits comparable to coverage for physical ailments.</p>
        <p>Appearing alongside his wife, Tipper, before a group of mental health professionals and advocates in suburban Washington, Mr. Gore pledged to make mental health care a priority in his administration. He described his proposal for children as a first step toward eliminating disparities in coverage for adults.</p>
        <p>''People still have insurance plans that actively discriminate against mental health,'' Mr. Gore said. ''They still don't recognize it as a treatable illness, just like diabetes or high blood pressure or heart disease.''</p>
        <p>The proposal was part of a package of mental health programs, some of them not new, that the vice president outlined today. Those measures included training teachers and police officers to identify mental illness, expanding community mental health services and creating a $3,000 tax credit for families to pay for long-term care, including in mental institutions.</p>
        <p>Achieving parity in insurance benefits for mental and physical illnesses is a leading legislative goal of mental health advocates, who contend inadequate insurance coverage has discouraged many sick people from seeking treatment.</p>
        <p>Under a 1996 law, group health plans are forbidden to set annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental health care that are lower than the limits for general medical and surgical services. But a Congressional report released two weeks ago found that thousands of companies were violating the law. Some companies have skirted the 1996 law's requirements by replacing dollar limits on mental health care with numerical limits on outpatient visits, treatment sessions or days in the hospital.</p>
        <p>Legislation with bipartisan support in Congress would attempt to close such loopholes by prohibiting insurers from setting limits on the number of outpatient visits or days in the hospital for treatment of mental disorders that are more stringent than those for the treatment of physical illnesses.</p>
        <p>In an interview today, Mr. Gore suggested that he would support a version of that legislation, but focused only on children. ''We want to close any loopholes that allow insurers to shirk their obligations under the law,'' he said, without offering specifics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's Republican presidential opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, signed legislation in Texas in 1997 requiring health insurers to provide coverage for mental disorders comparable to that for physical diseases.</p>
        <p>But Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said the Texas governor has not said whether he would support similar federal legislation. Mr. Bartlett added, ''Governor Bush understands the importance of mental health parity.'' Opponents of Mr. Gore's proposal, including many business groups, argue that it would significantly increase the cost of health insurance, potentially causing some employers, particularly small ones, to drop their policies. Mr. Gore estimated that his plan for children would increase premiums by less than 1 percent, but the opponents said the increases could be much greater.</p>
        <p>''Every time you increase costs, you cause people to drop coverage, and the end result is more people without insurance,'' said Frank Coleman, vice president for media relations of the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''The question is, do we want Cadillac coverage, or do we want to find ways to insure the 40 million people without coverage, who mostly work for small businesses?''</p>
        <p>Mental health advocates heralded Mr. Gore's proposal as a crucial step toward eliminating discrimination against the mentally ill.</p>
        <p>''He's put his finger on a major problem,'' said Laurie Flynn, executive director for the National Alliance of the Mentally Ill, a nonprofit group. ''The lack of adequate coverage brings enormous economic hardships to families. They can quickly run through savings, forcing them to re-mortgage houses and dip into college funds.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore refrained from criticizing Mr. Bush, or even mentioning him, at this morning's event. In sharp contrast to his gloomy attacks on Mr. Bush in recent weeks, Mr. Gore was upbeat, describing the times as exciting, optimistic and hopeful for people with mental illnesses.</p>
        <p>''I truly believe there has never been a more hopeful time for mental health care in America,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The vice president asked the crowd for its votes, saying that he wanted a ''mandate'' to make mental health a priority in his administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said the shootings at Columbine High School last year showed that the federal government needed to help schools train teachers to identify mentally ill students and to hire mental health counselors. ''As Columbine taught us, we can't wait until tragedy strikes to reach out effectively to troubled young people and give them help and hope,'' he said.</p>
