        <p>The Organization of American States agreed today to address accusations of fraud in Peru's presidential election when foreign ministers meet in Canada this weekend.</p>
        <p>Representatives adopted a cautious posture, refusing a United States-backed move to formally convene the ministers on an emergency basis.</p>
        <p>The State Department said it was satisfied with the outcome, even though Luis J. Lauredo, the American ambassador to the O.A.S., had to withdraw a motion to invoke a resolution that would have added symbolic urgency to the response.</p>
        <p>A State Department spokesman said the plan to add Peru to the agenda in Windsor, Canada, beginning Sunday showed ''this registered as a serious problem with hemispheric implications.''</p>
        <p>The State Department had issued mixed signals on whether the accusations of fraud render invalid the re-election of President Alberto K. Fujimori on Sunday. Philip Reeker, a department spokesman, said today that Peru's ''electoral process was obviously flawed,'' but refused to repeat a colleague's charge Monday that Mr. Fujimori could not legitimately claim another term.</p>
        <p>The United States is not contemplating unilateral action against Peru, Mr. Reeker said.</p>
        <p>O.A.S. officials and diplomats predicted that hemispheric governments would move carefully. Some noted that electoral fraud was a different threat to democratic rule than, say, a military coup, and some feared inciting violence in Peru. The issue of stability in Peru ''has a great weight on how they will proceed,'' a Latin American diplomat said..</p>
        <p>Ambassador Lauredo surprised some officials by sounding a vigorous defense of democracy, considering that American anti-narcotic officials are deeply uneasy over the prospect of losing Mr. Fujimori as one of the region's few reliable allies on that issue. Envoys from Canada, Costa Rica and Argentina took stands similar to Mr. Lauredo's.</p>
        <p>''The attacks on democracy today are more subtle than ever,'' Mr. Lauredo said. ''The thing that unites us is our common embrace of democratic values and our shared responsibility to defend them when they are threatened.''</p>
        <p>Peru's neighbors are especially wary of strong action, as were Mexico and Brazil, officials said. Brazil's ambassador, Carlos Alberto Leiti Barbosa, spoke of ''maintaining the necessary delicate balance between the defense of democracy and respect for sovereignty.''</p>
        <p>But Odeen Ishmael, the ambassador of Guyana, said that elections in that small nation north of Brazil had been rigged for many years and that  Guyana owed a debt of gratitude to O.A.S. observers who helped safeguard subsequent elections.</p>
        <p>The diplomats received a preliminary report today from Eduardo Stein, who monitored the elections for the O.A.S. The report detailed irregularities in Peru's system to compute vote tallies, a lack of candidates' equal access to the mass media, the use of public resources for political gain and improper investigations into various complaints.</p>
        <p>Peru's ambassador, Beatriz Ramacciotti, accused Mr. Stein of exceeding his mandate, saying he ''transformed himself into a political actor.''</p>
