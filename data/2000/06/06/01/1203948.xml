        <p>The authorities said yesterday that they were considering filing manslaughter or perhaps murder charges against a Queens woman whose son died this spring from injuries she inflicted on him 14 years ago.</p>
        <p>The case is an extremely rare instance in which a long-ago assault becomes fodder for a homicide investigation.</p>
        <p>The city medical examiner said yesterday that Joshua Slaughter, 14, died on April 11 from complications related to injuries he received during his first weeks of life, when his mother, Mitzi Slaughter, aggressively shook him in their home in Jamaica, Queens. Because of the shaking, the police said, the boy suffered a brain injury, developed cerebral palsy and required continuous care.</p>
        <p>Ms. Slaughter, now 36, pleaded guilty in 1988 to second-degree assault and endangering the welfare of a child. She was sentenced to six months in prison and five years' probation, and lost custody of her son. She appeared to have fully served her sentence for a crime she committed as a young mother.</p>
        <p>But the case against Ms. Slaughter was revived last week when the medical examiner, after rounds of tests, determined that Joshua died of bronchial pneumonia, blood poisoning and neurological disorders related to shaken-baby syndrome. ''The complications that occurred are a consequence of the shaking that occurred in 1986,'' said Ellen S. Borakove, the medical examiner's spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Ms. Slaughter was being questioned last night by investigators at the 103rd Precinct in Jamaica, where the authorities said they were considering filing fresh charges against her. ''We're conferring with the Queens district attorney to determine charges,'' said Sgt. Brian Burke, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>The state's criminal procedure law allows for renewed prosecution of assault cases when injuries received in the assault later cause the victim's death. Mary DeBourbon, a spokeswoman for the Queens County district attorney, said that if the investigation found grounds, the prosecutors could file charges. ''It's not impossible,'' she said. ''It's legally permissible.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. DeBourbon also said yesterday that prosecutors were still gathering records from the 1986 case and had not reached a decision. Ms. Slaughter's circumstance is rare but not unprecedented. In a similar case last year, the Bronx district attorney, Robert Johnson, considered but ultimately declined the bringing of new charges against a woman who attacked Rodney Irby, a Bronx man who died 25 years after being shot and stabbed in a dispute over drugs in the South Bronx. Mr. Irby was left a paraplegic by the assault.</p>
        <p>The authorities said the attack against Joshua Slaughter had caused brain injuries and palsy disabling enough to eventually require institutionalization. Cerebral palsy is a chronic condition affecting body movement and muscle development. Most cases are caused by damage to a fetus's brain, but injuries to an infant's developing brain -- like  those from violent shaking -- can also cause the condition, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Jennifer Banks, a spokeswoman for the Administration for Children's Services, said that Ms. Slaughter had lost custody of Joshua after she attacked him. The boy was placed in foster care and under the administration's supervision from 1986 to 1997. During that time, Ms. Slaughter remained in contact with her son and sometimes spent time with him. ''The record indicates that the mom did visit periodically,'' Ms. Banks said.</p>
        <p>She said that in 1997, the agency had transferred Joshua to an institution run by the city's Department of Mental Health. The boy also received treatment from the United Cerebral Palsy center in Queens.</p>
        <p>The police said yesterday that on the evening of April 11 Joshua was taken to Mary Immaculate Hospital from the United Cerebral Palsy center at 110-35 164th Place in Queens. He died shortly after arriving.</p>
        <p>United Cerebral Palsy declined to comment yesterday. A spokesman for the city's Department of Health, reached late in the day, said the agency was unable to immediately locate records on Joshua 's case.</p>
