        <p>Re ''Campaigning on Social Security'' (editorial, May 29):</p>
        <p>You say the comparison of the projected returns on private Social Security accounts versus the return on money deposited as taxes in the trust fund is ''highly misleading'' because the ''economy is expected to slow over the next several decades.'' But predicting large swings in the economy is as uncertain as guessing how the Mets will do in 20 years.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Campaigning on Social Security'' (editorial, May 29):</p>
        <p>You say the comparison of the projected returns on private Social Security accounts versus the return on money deposited as taxes in the trust fund is ''highly misleading'' because the ''economy is expected to slow over the next several decades.'' But predicting large swings in the economy is as uncertain as guessing how the Mets will do in 20 years.</p>
        <p>Second, changing the law to allow the government to invest in the stock market is a horrendous idea. With the amount of money that flows through Social Security, the trustees of such enormous accounts could destroy companies that rely on the capitalization of the stock market.  Furthermore, one of the government's main responsibilities is to regulate corporate America to ensure a fair playing field. A stake in the game would erode that ability.</p>
