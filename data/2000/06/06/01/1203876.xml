        <p>If the battery in your cell phone is about to die, get a grip.</p>
        <p>That is the underlying message in a new charger called Aladdinpower, a portable power generator that lets cell phone users reinvigorate their batteries by squeezing a small, handheld pump.</p>
        <p>Diane Collins, advertising director for the Bridges Equipment Company, an outdoor-power company in Brandon, Fla., that distributes the chargers, said she pumps the grip while she is on and off her cell phone and has found that the time it takes to recharge the battery varies. Her husband had a dead cell phone battery, she said, and it took him about three minutes of steady pumping to recharge it halfway.</p>
        <p>Designed by Japanese engineers, Aladdinpower works by converting each squeeze of the grip into electricity that replenishes the cell phone battery. The brushed aluminum device weighs 11 ounces and is 5 1/4 inches long.</p>
        <p>To work with the variety of cell phones on the market, it must be used with a DC power adapter designed for your particular phone. Cell phone users who charge their phones through their car's cigarette lighter probably already have the adapter, Ms. Collins said.</p>
        <p>For now, the device is sold only through Magellan's, a travel supply catalog (www  .magellans.com), and through a branch of the Bridges Equipment Web site (www  .aladdinpower.com).</p>
        <p>Magellan's site sells the power charger for $75, including a leather carrying case. On the Bridges site, the charger can be purchased alone for $59.95.</p>
        <p>On both sites, the power generator comes with a small flashlight that can be squeezed into action in an emergency.</p>
