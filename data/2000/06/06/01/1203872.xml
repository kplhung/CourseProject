        <p>Re ''Risk of Arms Race Seen in U.S. Design of Missile Defense'' (front page, May 28):</p>
        <p>Shouldn't Russian and American engineers be working together to develop a workable antiballistic missile system? Ideally, the system should be financed, owned and operated by an international body, possibly the United Nations. In fact, having a system that could be used to protect people worldwide against the common nuclear enemy would be something worth trying to achieve.</p>

        <p>Re ''Risk of Arms Race Seen in U.S. Design of Missile Defense'' (front page, May 28):</p>

        <p>Failing to build an antiballistic missile system for fear of another arms race merely preserves the outdated cold-war paradigm until the inevitable day when the bomb is used again. Ultimately, no amount of diplomacy is going to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Why don't we try to address this problem?</p>
