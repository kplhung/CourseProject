        <p>The Big Bang of telecommunications is now on the horizon, the long-awaited moment when a third generation of Internet-based mobile phone applications and services will sweep across the world. It will change personal communications in a more profound way than the arrival of the personal computer changed computing two decades ago.</p>
        <p>At least that is what they say at Nokia in Finland and at Ericsson in Sweden, two of the largest makers of wireless telecommunications equipment in the world. But the third-generation phones they are talking about, so-called 3G phones, are still several years away for most of the world, according to research scientists and wireless services developers here and in Helsinki. The first-generation analog phones are still in widespread use, after all, especially in the United States, and second-generation digital phones are still gaining in popularity.</p>
        <p>When the 3G mobile Internet devices do arrive, they may not even be recognizable as phones, because voice conversations will be just one of their many capabilities. In fact, the researchers here do not even call them phones, preferring instead to call them mobile communicators or mobile terminals. Eventually they will replace cell phones, the researchers say, allowing people to tap into a seemingly endless array of personal services, at any time, anywhere.</p>
        <p>But there are daunting technical, commercial and regulatory issues to resolve before the Big Bang is reality. Consumers, especially in the United States, will have to wait through a succession of interim steps -- requiring a change of phones at each step, of course -- and wade through a morass of confusing terms and services to get from 2G to 3G.</p>
        <p>There is a seemingly insatiable demand for new mobile Internet  services here in Scandinavia, where most people over the age of 15 carry wireless phones, and in Japan, where more than 20,000 people a day are signing up for Internet access through their phones. The new 3G services will roll out first in these areas, where the ''wireless lifestyle'' is  already well established. In the United States, where the Internet is closely associated with the personal computer and where mobile standards  are fragmented, the wireless future is still slightly out of focus. But, the researchers here point out, the early years of personal computing were also confusing and frustrating, yet today the Internet and e-mail have become indispensable to tens of millions of people.</p>
        <p>The key to 3G is speed, the ability to transmit and receive digital data at rates of about two million bits per second, more than 35 times faster than today's fastest dial-up personal computer modems and more than 200 times the speed of most current handheld wireless data devices.</p>
        <p>At 3G speeds, a pocket-size communicator could zoom beyond simple voice calls and messaging to include mobile video conferencing, the routine use of video postcards, the delivery of CD-quality music, the storage and retrieval of personal information, as well as potentially endless  variations on mobile electronic commerce, or m-commerce.</p>
        <p>''Just as we did not foresee the development of e-mail, the World Wide Web or other popular services when the PC was first introduced, we do not know what services will eventually emerge for 3G,'' said Yrjo Neuvo, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Nokia's mobile phones division in Helsinki. ''But we do know that they will come faster'' than they did for the PC, he said.</p>
        <p>Shown in nonworking prototype form at Nokia's research center in Helsinki, the 3G phones are small enough to slip in a pocket. They will be held not up against the ear as today's cell phones are, but in the hand and operated either by tapping on the touch-sensitive screen or by voice commands. The screen will display icons that represent a calendar, an address book, stored files and other information familiar to people who today carry a handheld computer like a Palm or Pocket PC device.</p>
        <p>The phones will allow high-speed  perusing of the Web, with pages modified to be displayed on a small color screen -- Web Lite, as some people here call it. They will also enable instant access to news, impulse ordering of goods and services, personal banking and stock trading, multiplayer games and the ability to send and receive multimedia messages easily with people all over the world.</p>
        <p>Unlike today's crazy quilt of incompatible wireless standards, which prevent most American cell phones from working elsewhere in the world and even in different parts of the United States, the goal of 3G developers is a single, unified global standard, known as the Universal Mobile Telephone System, or U.M.T.S.</p>
        <p>A handful of licenses for providing 3G services have already been granted in Japan and Europe, for astonishing amounts of money. ''This is the second coming for the telecom companies,'' said Zaheed Hague, chief executive of Room33.com, a wireless application developer here. ''They missed the Internet, and this time they don't want to miss out.''</p>
        <p>Like hundreds of companies in Scandinavia, Room33 is focusing on an interim technology called Wireless Application Protocol, or WAP, an evolving international standard for delivering Internet data services  and advanced telephony to WAP-enabled phones, pagers, handheld computers and other wireless devices.</p>
        <p>The first WAP-enabled phones are just beginning to show up in the United States, after a slow start in Europe. Motorola, the largest American maker of cellular phones, said all of its new phones will be WAP-capable by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>A somewhat similar but incompatible service called i-Mode is wildly popular in Japan, attracting more than 7 million users in 15 months. Encouraged by such enthusiasm, hundreds of companies here are developing WAP applications for everything from banking and stock trading to ticketing services, control of industrial robots, Internet search engines and entertainment.</p>
        <p>For example, Codeonline, a start-up company in Espoo, Finland, is preparing to introduce a mobile entertainment application that will let people play trivia games on their WAP phones. PicoFun, a Stockholm-based start-up, has a WAP-based game that lets phone users compete in fantasy soccer leagues.</p>
        <p>The idea of playing games on a phone may be curious to Americans, where cell phones are still relatively rare compared with Finland. But at Nokia, down the road in Espoo, executives proclaim with almost religious fervor that more people worldwide will be reaching the Internet through wireless devices by 2003 than through personal computers. That is already the case in Japan.</p>
        <p>Americans accustomed to browsing the Web on a big color computer screen over a high-speed link will find the WAP browser to be agonizingly slow and spare, with a clumsy, thumb-controlled user interface and a display that is suitable for only a few lines of text and perhaps a small crude graphic.</p>
        <p>The key to WAP, however, is the development of services that are exclusively for mobile users who need  snippets of information or who want to make simple transactions or requests from a mobile handset. Making a credit card payment or booking a train ticket from a WAP screen, for example, does not require a fancy graphical interface.</p>
        <p>Early WAP users in Europe have complained that their wireless phone bills leap when they use the system, because it takes extra time to connect to the Internet and navigate through a WAP service.</p>
        <p>WAP will really take off, the developers say, when phones make the transition from today's circuit-switched system, in which the user has to dial into an Internet service, to a packet-based system that is always  connected to the Internet.</p>
        <p>In a circuit-switched system, like the one used for most phone calls today, a private line is established between the caller and the recipient, and it remains open until the phone is hung up. It is like having a road reserved just for your car as you drive to the store and back. The user is typically billed for the length of time the private circuit is being used.</p>
        <p>In a packet-based system, which is the basis of the Internet, voice and data traffic is broken into chunks of digital bits, or packets, that travel over a shared common network by taking the most efficient -- and thus least costly -- route. Using the car analogy, any number of cars can share your lane, yet you arrive at your destination just the same. The  roads are always open, whether you are driving or not.</p>
        <p>In a packet-based wireless system, the user would pay either according to the volume of bits that are sent and received or on a subscription basis for a fixed monthly fee. The pricing models are still being decided.</p>
        <p>''The shift from circuit to packet systems is far more significant to consumers than was the shift from analog to digital,'' said Bjorn Norhammar, manager of market development for 3G communicators at  Ericsson.</p>
        <p>This transition to packet-based services is expected to begin later this year in Europe, through a technology called General Packet Radio System. Based on 2G networks, G.P.R.S. is often called ''two and a half G,'' signaling its status as a step between 2G and true 3G networks.</p>
        <p>Although it is technically feasible that G.P.R.S. systems will have a connection speed of up to 170 kilobits (thousands of bits) per second, Nokia says the first packet-radio systems will have a maximum rate of 26 or 39  kbps. Still, that is faster than 2G phones, which are generally 9.6 kbps.</p>
        <p>A variant of the packet-based system called Cellular Digital Packet Data, or C.D.P.D., is being introduced in the United States by AT&amp;T Wireless Services, under the Digital Pocket Net brand name. Users of the Pocket Net service have free, unlimited access to about 40 Web sites for tasks like finding directions, shopping for books and CD's, trading stocks, making flight reservations and checking news headlines. But the Pocket Net system has a speed limit of about 19 kbps and is seen as a transition step toward G.P.R.S., now primarily limited to phones based on  European and Asian standards.</p>
        <p>One of the more intriguing features of 3G communicators will be locality, that is, the ability of the network to ''know'' where the user is  whenever the phone is on. Location-based services are being developed here, for example, to notify a subscriber to an online dating service whenever another subscriber who matches a certain profile is nearby.</p>
        <p>Or a subscriber could sign up for a service that would let shops or restaurants beam the digital equivalent of discount coupons to the mobile device whenever the 3G customer is in the area. In another example, a 3G  device installed in a car would allowthe police to track it down if the  car was stolen. Obviously, many privacy issues remain to be resolved.</p>
        <p>Although 3G communicators are still years away, researchers here are hard at work on 4G, which promises data rates of 100 megabits per second -- sufficient for video teleconferencing -- and wireless networking with televisions, garage door openers and other devices using a technology called Bluetooth. But when Nokia officials were setting up a computer presentation on Bluetooth and other future mobile technologies, they still had to fumble with cables and wait for Windows to boot up.</p>
        <p>''If our phones took as long to turn on as Windows,'' Martin Sandelin, a senior vice president at Nokia, said with a sigh, ''we wouldn't make as many phone calls.''</p>
