        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio sought today to build momentum in his campaign for the Senate, riding his newly christened ''Mainstream Express'' across upstate New York as he greeted supporters and stepped up criticism of his opponent.</p>
        <p>Fresh from the Republicans' state convention Tuesday at which he was chosen as the nominee to face Hillary Rodham Clinton in November, Mr. Lazio strolled hand in hand with his wife, Patricia, through a winery and a glass museum and along a downtown street in rustic Watkins Glen.

        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio sought today to build momentum in his campaign for the Senate, riding his newly christened ''Mainstream Express'' across upstate New York as he greeted supporters and stepped up criticism of his opponent.</p>
        <p>Fresh from the Republicans' state convention Tuesday at which he was chosen as the nominee to face Hillary Rodham Clinton in November, Mr. Lazio strolled hand in hand with his wife, Patricia, through a winery and a glass museum and along a downtown street in rustic Watkins Glen. He made five stops, traveling from Syracuse to Binghamton and stopping overnight in Newburgh, from which he will continue a tour that will travel through the New York metropolitan area before ending Friday on Long Island.</p>
        <p>Before setting off, Mr. Lazio said the bus title was meant to emphasize what he considered his mainstream voting record in the House and ''to reinforce this is a grass-roots campaign, that we are going to be out and open and among the people.''</p>
        <p>''I'm going to be answering your questions like I am right now at every stop,'' he told reporters. The campaign, he said in a reference to security for the first lady, ''should not be about rope lines and checking credentials and scripted responses.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio did not seem aware that his own campaign staff had issued credentials to reporters to ride on the bus trailing his, which is modeled after Senator John McCain's ''Straight Talk Express'' used during this year's presidential primary season, though Mr. Lazio is not granting reporters the same freewheeling access as the senator had.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Lazio's penchant to answer questions at stops meant for meeting and greeting people appears to grate on his staff. ''Guys, no more walking avails,'' a campaign aide cautioned reporters, using jargon for a news conference. This came after reporters jostled for access to Mr. Lazio after he toured a crammed milk bottling factory in Syracuse.</p>
        <p>And despite his vow of a less structured campaign style, there were ample signs that Mr. Lazio's appearances were as scripted as any other candidate for a major office. At the stop in Watkins Glen, a teenage volunteer from Representative Amo Houghton's office told supporters rounded up by phone, ''You just follow me when I start cheering, O.K.,'' before Mr. Lazio's bus pulled up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio also repeated variations of what sounded like a stump speech that he had been offering at stops for the last week, talking about the ''need to earn this'' and to find ways to stop a brain drain of young people to other states that amounted to ''exporting our children from this state.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's staff issued a statement today, taking issue with Mr. Lazio's criticisms of ''scripted responses.'' It said the prepared text of Mr. Lazio's convention speech at one point contained a note ''(smile)'' as if to remind him to do so when he commented on the ''low wages'' his father paid him for helping out in the family store. Mr. Lazio did smile.</p>
        <p>''Candidates in glass buses shouldn't throw stones,'' Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, said. ''Once again, Rick Lazio's rhetoric doesn't match reality.''</p>
        <p>In one of a series of 15-minute interviews that he has begun giving reporters traveling with him, Mr. Lazio denied that he had a prepared stump speech, challenging reporters to watch for one. ''I've got to sort of depend on you guys to set the record straight because you are out there and you've seen what's real,'' he said. ''If you think I'm reading questions and reading a stump speech every time I go out, then I think you have cause for making a point.''</p>
        <p>Told of the similarity in remarks heard at several stops, Mr. Lazio replied, ''I think these are things that I believe.'' In the interview, he also reiterated his strategy ''to stay focused on the positive'' and avoid being drawn into'' a tit-for-tat with Mrs. Clinton or her surrogates. But he struggled to differentiate himself without criticizing her.</p>
        <p>Offering an example of the overreach of government that he ascribes to Mrs. Clinton's ''far left'' philosophy, Mr. Lazio cited her failed effort to develop a universal health care program in the early 1990's. He said she and the Clinton administration ''ended up with a product that was a disaster and probably helped contribute to her party losing control of the House.''</p>
        <p>In public for the most part, Mr. Lazio toned down the subtle attacks he had sprinkled in his convention speech. But addressing supporters in Watkins Glen, he talked of himself and his wife raising his two children, who are now in the first and second grade, and added, ''I will tell you we worked real hard, especially Pat, to make sure those children were raised right, and no village is going to teach them what parents can.''</p>
        <p>As the day drew to a close, after a rally at Elmira College and before another at a Binghamton golf club, Mr. Lazio made an unscheduled stop -- at a video store in a mall to select something for the long trips. Was this a bid for spontaneity and grass roots? Perhaps the answer was in his choice. He picked ''Analyze This.''</p>
