        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>INQUIRING MINDS WANT TO KNOW  Twenty-two Senate Democrats jumped into the debate over Social Security yesterday, writing to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for more details on his proposal to create individual investment accounts ''so that the American public, elected officials and other policy makers can evaluate your proposal.'' The letter, circulated by Senators Charles E. Schumer of New York and Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, asked questions intended to show some of the hard choices that might be involved in reshaping the retirement system. Among them: Would the government do anything to limit investment choices to minimize risk? Would the proposal cut Social Security benefits? Would the cuts have a disproportionate impact on women? ''We feel strongly that as we debate any change to our Social Security system, the public needs the full details of any proposals,'' the Democrats wrote. Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said Mr. Bush welcomed bipartisan input and supported a proposal by a bipartisan group of senators to have a commission study changes to the retirement system.</p>

        <p>KNOWING NOTHING, TELLING ALL  Gov. George W. Bush often revels in not being a know-it-all, but when Gov. Gary E. Johnson of New Mexico tried to join in that celebration on Wednesday, he may well have taken it just a tad too far. ''I'll tell you a story,'' Mr. Johnson said to scores of people who had turned out to meet Mr. Bush in Albuquerque. ''At one of these governors' conferences, George turns to me and says, 'What are they talking about?' I said, 'I don't know.' He said, 'You don't know a thing, do you?' And I said, 'Not one thing.' He said, 'Neither do I.' And we kind of high-fived. And my point here is -- is that -- when it comes to politics, it's really hard to find somebody who will rather admit -- or rather talk about -- the things they don't know and make that really evident.'' Mr. Bush has certainly been known to do that.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>DELIVERING VENOM  Bob Mulholland, a consultant to the California Democratic Party, is celebrated for his unsparing verbal assaults on Republicans. But last week, in a gesture that seemed over the top even for him, he sent former Speaker Newt Gingrich and his fiancee, Callista Bisek, a $12 gift from their online wedding registry at Williams-Sonoma: a half-dozen dish towels and a cheery note. ''Newt: Here's a set of dishcloths to clean up the mess with your second wife,'' Mr. Mulholland wrote, adding: ''Callista: In 5 years he'll be w/another younger woman. That's his pattern.'' That was too much for the California Republican chairman, John McGraw, who issued a statement calling on the state Democratic chairman, Art Torres, to dismiss Mr. Mulholland, and sent along a can of Lysol to disinfect Mr. Mulholland's office. ''Your flunky's latest despicable, hate-filled act of venom sinks lower than a snake's belly in Death Valley,'' Mr. McGraw wrote. Mr. Mulholland was unfazed. ''I'm happy to see the California Republicans defending Newt Gingrich,'' he said. ''This man is despicable. He owes an apology to the American people for attacking Bill Clinton while he was carrying on his own affair.''</p>
