        <p>The Milstein real estate family has lost a bruising battle with Prince Faisal ibn Khalid of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan International Airlines over the historic Roosevelt Hotel, near Grand Central Terminal.</p>
        <p>The Milsteins must repay Prince Faisal and the airline $23 million of the $59.5 million they paid for the 1,013-room hotel on Madison Avenue in 1999, according to a decision in State Supreme Court last Friday.</p>
        <p>Judge Ira Gammerman ruled that the Milsteins must adhere to their  1979 agreement to sell the hotel to the investors for $36.5 million, which is one-seventh of its current value, hotel analysts say. The Milsteins had forced the airline to pay off a $23 million mortgage on the hotel before they would agree to the sale.</p>
        <p>It was a good deal gone bad for the Milsteins and a windfall for the Pakistanis, who had lost money on the hotel nearly every year since they took it over in 1979, under a lease with an option to buy in 20 years. They now own a major hotel at one of Manhattan's best corners, Madison Avenue and 45th Street.</p>
        <p>''It was a battle,'' Aslam R. Khan, managing director of Pakistan Airlines Investments, said yesterday. ''They didn't want to let it go. I'm grateful that justice prevailed.''</p>
        <p>Edwin V. Petz, general counsel for Milstein Properties Corporation, declined to talk about the decision. ''We expect to appeal,'' he said yesterday.</p>
        <p>To press his case, Mr. Khan had hired Chadbourne &amp; Parke, the law firm that represented the airline in the original deal with the Milsteins.</p>
        <p>In his decision last Friday, Judge Gammerman said that he was left with the impression that the litigation was ''the culmination of the Milsteins' efforts to find a loophole in the lease in the hope of escaping an agreement which, with the passage of time, appeared to be less favorable than originally anticipated.''</p>
        <p>Built in 1924 by a predecessor of the Penn Central Railroad to serve  passengers at Grand Central Terminal, the 20-story Roosevelt was one of the first hotels in the world to offer a health club, child care and a kennel for guests' dogs. In its heyday, Guy Lombardo broadcast ''Auld Lang Syne'' over the radio from the Roosevelt Grill.</p>
        <p>But the hotel and Penn Central had fallen on hard times by 1978, when the Loews Corporation bought the Roosevelt, as well as the Barclay and the Biltmore Hotels, for $55 million. Loews promptly resold the Roosevelt to Paul Milstein, a major New York developer, for $30 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milstein leased the hotel to the Pakistani airline for $2.7 million to $4 million a year. He also gave it an irrevocable option to buy the hotel, court papers show. The city was wracked by a fiscal crisis, so it seemed a good deal for the Milsteins.</p>
        <p>But when the Pakistanis moved to buy the hotel in 1999, a real estate boom was under way. The 1979 agreement had specified a sale price of $36.5 million. Paul's son, Howard Milstein, was no longer eager to sell a hotel that was now worth more than $250 million.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Prince Faisal, who had invested in the original deal, and the airline had lost more than $70 million operating the hotel, where the carpets were threadbare and the brass was tarnished. The Pakistanis closed the hotel in 1995 for a $65 million renovation and hired a new management company, Interstate Hotels. The hotel reopened in 1997 and began making money in the next year, when the investors moved to buy the hotel for $36.5 million.</p>
        <p>The Milstein family stalled, and later demanded that the airline also pay off a $23 million mortgage, which the Milsteins had taken out. At the same time, building, fire and health inspectors swarmed over the hotel, issuing citations.</p>
        <p>''We were putting out fires every day,'' Jim Heineman, a former manager of the Roosevelt, said in an interview last fall. ''We certainly felt there was pressure on us.''</p>
        <p>The airline bought the hotel for $59.5 million last year and went to court. Last week, Judge Gammerman said he found most of the testimony on behalf of the Milsteins ''to be contrived or lacking in meaningful detail,'' and ordered the real estate family to reimburse the investors.</p>
