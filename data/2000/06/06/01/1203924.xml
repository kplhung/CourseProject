        <p>Anthony Becht has moved quietly around the Jets' locker room for a month all but ignored, the spotlight cast on the Jets' extraordinary class of four first-round draft picks barely casting a glow on him.</p>
        <p>On draft day, Becht, a tight end, was the fourth of the first-round picks, and his turn came while the buzz about the Jets' surprise selection of a quarterback was still at full volume. At the rookie minicamp a month ago, Becht sat near his locker, talking with reporters who wandered by waiting for quarterback Chad Pennington, or one of the other two picks, the pass rushers Shaun Ellis and John Abraham, to arrive.</p>
        <p>But last week, during the veterans' minicamp, Becht managed to steal a bit of the attention. He made several superb catches and, in the final moments of the camp on Friday, made a spectacular diving catch in the end zone. As high as hopes are for Ellis and Abraham to shore up the pass rush, Becht may be the rookie with the best chance of having an immediate impact.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, I need to pick the offense up quickly,'' Becht said today, during the Jets' second rookie minicamp. ''It's the only way I'll be able to compete. As early as it is, I feel comfortable.''</p>
        <p>Becht was the second tight end selected in the draft and, on some teams' draft boards, was rated nearly equal to Bubba Franks, the tight end chosen ahead of him. Becht signed a five-year deal worth $5.5 million last Friday.</p>
        <p>Tight end, a source of nearly constant bewilderment for the Jets in recent years, was one of their most pressing needs this off-season. They spent a first-round pick on Kyle Brady in 1995, and he is now playing in Jacksonville. Last year they signed the former Pro Bowl selection Eric Green, only to release him after a disappointing season. On draft day, Coach Al Groh sounded hopeful that Becht -- hailed for his versatility as a pass catcher and blocker, as a tight end who can be stationary or go in motion -- would fill the Jets' needs.</p>
        <p>''As part of his position, his value comes in the red zone, goal-line areas,'' Groh said on draft day. ''That's when the running game gets sticky, so you've got to be able to knock guys off the line.''</p>
        <p>Fred Baxter, now in his eighth year, has heard all this before. From his corner locker, he has watched tight ends come and go. Last season, Baxter caught 8 passes for 66 yards and 2 touchdowns. Then he endured the off-season talk of the team's desperate need for a tight end.</p>
        <p>''They picked him in the first round, eventually he'll have to start,'' Baxter said of Becht. ''I know that. I don't worry about that. I worry about what I have to do to stay in place if they need me. It's a business. I don't get caught up in all that about starting. They've been trying to get rid of me since I got here. It hasn't worked yet.''</p>
