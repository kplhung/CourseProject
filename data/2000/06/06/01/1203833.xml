        <p>On May 22, when Ingo Maurer, the German lighting designer, gave a happening for 600 people called ''Harlem Lights: A Night at the Alhambra,'' he was a groundbreaker. It was the first time that the 1905 Alhambra Theater, at Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and 126th Street, where Billie Holiday performed in the 1930's, had come alive since it was abandoned in the 1960's. And for Mr. Maurer, right, it was a first-time exhibit in Harlem. He illuminated the theater with an aluminum heart sprouting his Lucellino light bulbs, with goose feather wings, far left. At one end, more than 100 candles suspended on thin steel wires hung as if floating in air over a shallow trough of water. When guests put on special glasses, left, and looked at a point of light, they saw paired hearts. ''I like the vitality, the tenderness that is there in Harlem,'' said Mr. Maurer, who created the evening with Cheryl Hill, a film producer. ''I wanted to create an atmosphere and use light as a fluid element.'' He and Ms. Hill plan to stage more events at the Alhambra.</p>
