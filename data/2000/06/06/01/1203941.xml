        <p>The will of Cardinal John J. O'Connor was filed in court yesterday. He left the majority of his personal holdings to the Archdiocese of New York, his siblings and an order of nuns he established.</p>
        <p>The cardinal also ordered that all his personal papers marked confidential or ''pontifical secret'' be destroyed.</p>
        <p>It was not clear from the documents released yesterday how much the cardinal's estate might be worth, but he ordered the bulk of it given to his siblings.</p>
        <p>The will, which was filed in Manhattan Surrogate's Court yesterday, mandates that the cardinal's chalice and all earnings from the publication of his papers be donated to the Sisters of Life, the order he founded.</p>
        <p>Its 30 members devote themselves to protecting the sanctity of life, whether by running shelters for unwed mothers or by ministering to the sick and elderly.</p>
        <p>And a $1,000 bequest was left to pay for the celebration of 50 Masses in the archdiocese.</p>
        <p>The will also contained detailed instructions for conducting his funeral. He requested specific speakers and also mandated that one reading be performed by a person chosen by the archdiocese's Office of Black Ministry and one by the Office of Hispanic Affairs.</p>
        <p>The cardinal asked that his coffin be ''as simple as possible for burial in a crypt.'' He asked that the price be ''between the lower one-third and the mid-range average cost.''</p>
