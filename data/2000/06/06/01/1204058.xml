        <p>SUNSHINE-Albert A., Dr. Age 78, died May 30, 2000 in Boca Raton, FL. Beloved husband of Victoria, devoted father of Randi Sunshine of Los Angeles, CA, and Dr. William Sunshine of Boca Raton, FL. He is survived by two sisters, Naomi Trigg of Stony Brook, NY and Caryl Hillelson of Pittsburgh, PA. His joys were his four grandchildren, Jacob Sherkow, Abigail Sherkow, Benjamin Sunshine and Jonathan Sunshine. Dr. Sunshine maintained a private practice in Mattituck, NY for 40 years and upon retirement became a professional bridge teacher and Director. He will be interred in the Veteran's Cemetery in Calverton, NY. A memorial service will be held at a later time. Donations: The Mattituck/Laurel Library, Box 1434, Mattituck, New York 11952.</p>
        <p>SUNSHINE-Al. We will miss his zest for life, his restless probing intellect, and his critique of our bridge skills. Barbara and Ralph Shapiro</p>
