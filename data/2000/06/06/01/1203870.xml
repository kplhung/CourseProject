        <p>The dancers of the Martha Graham Company, which suspended operations suddenly on Friday because of financial problems, have declined an invitation to perform independently at the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C. The troupe had been scheduled to open the festival next Thursday.</p>
        <p>The decision to suspend activity in the Graham company, school and junior ensemble came during a battle between Ron Protas, whom Graham named as her successor and who leads the Martha Graham Trust, and board members and administrators, including the acting chairman, Francis Mason and Marvin Preston, executive director of the Graham company.

        <p>The dancers of the Martha Graham Company, which suspended operations suddenly on Friday because of financial problems, have declined an invitation to perform independently at the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C. The troupe had been scheduled to open the festival next Thursday.</p>
        <p>The decision to suspend activity in the Graham company, school and junior ensemble came during a battle between Ron Protas, whom Graham named as her successor and who leads the Martha Graham Trust, and board members and administrators, including the acting chairman, Francis Mason and Marvin Preston, executive director of the Graham company. Board members on both sides say the feud has made donors reluctant to help the company, which has a deficit of $500,000.</p>
        <p>The dancers said in a strongly worded statement on Tuesday that ''to work as a pickup company hired by individual presenters having to license the Martha Graham ballets like any other company in the world only profits Ron Protas and the Martha Graham Trust and not the Martha Graham Center or the company, which Martha herself founded and which has been in existence for nearly 75 years and in which place lives Martha's technique and ballets.''</p>
        <p>Responding to the dancers, Mr. Protas said yesterday that he receives no special fees for performances. Under the terms of his agreement with the Martha Graham Dance Center, which oversees the school and companies, he receives $1 a year in royalties, though he is a paid artistic consultant to the center.</p>
        <p>The dancers also said that accepting the offer to perform would be short-sighted and not a solution to ''the inherent problems that plague the inner structure of the Martha Graham Dance Company.'' Performing at the festival, they said, would ''not in any way address the larger concerns for the future or truly answer the question of who is responsible for bringing the company to this tragic point or why.''</p>
        <p>''The dancers wish to work cooperatively with the board and with Ron Protas to allow the company to remain together and to continue Martha's legacy,'' said the dancers. ''There is no justification based on ego, pride, money or power to suspend operations of a company of such great stature and significance as the Martha Graham Dance Company.'' The dancers agreed to meet Mr.  Preston and Mr. Mason at the troupe's temporary headquarters at 440 Lafayette Street in the East Village on Tuesday, the day they were to have begun rehearsals. Mr. Protas did not attend. When Mr. Preston and Mr. Mason left to talk with the students, a vote on the festival performances was taken with 13 dancers of the 17-member company voting no. Two dancers abstained and two did not attend the meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Protas, who would have had to license the dances to the festival for the performances, also turned down the invitation to avoid possible conflicts with the center. ''The leadership of the board and Ron deserve each other,'' said Charles Reinhart, who directs the festival with Stephanie Reinhart. ''Other companies and arts institutions have financial difficulties to a greater extent than this and are able to continue. This is a war, and the real casualties are the dancers and the Graham public.''</p>
        <p>In declining the invitation, the dancers lost three weeks of work, including rehearsals. A European tour, appearances in California and performances at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts have also been canceled. The company was also to perform at the Joyce Theater in Manhattan in November. Linda Shelton, executive director of the Joyce, said yesterday that the Joyce was exploring other possibilities for the Graham dates.</p>
        <p>Despina Diamantopoulou, speaking for the Graham students, issued a statement on Tuesday asking the public for emergency  financing to keep the school open. The suspension of the Graham school programs, which have drawn students around the world, has been a particular problem for the foreign students who make up half the annual enrollment of about 500 students. With all employees owed a month's pay, school administrators, class accompanists and teachers have volunteered to keep the school going day by day during the summer term while a search goes on for space and money.</p>
        <p>''Three accompanists showed up,'' Pearl Lang, a former Graham star who teaches at the school, said yesterday about a class this week. ''I had an orchestra!'' Among the offers of financial support to the school was a promise of $1,000, enough for one day's operation of the school, from a dancer who performed with Ruth St. Denis, Graham's teacher.</p>
        <p>''Theoretically we're closing up,'' Mr. Preston said yesterday. ''But I say 'theoretically' because we're still trying to figure out how to start it up. Nobody wants this thing to go away. We just have to be careful to be responsible.''</p>
