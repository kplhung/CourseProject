        <p>After nearly 25 years in the business, Randolph Walker knew better than to bank on an audition. Still, when he headed home last week after trying out for a bit part in a movie called ''Dummy,'' he could not help feeling a little hopeful.</p>
        <p>Life as a New York actor demands a difficult combination of realism and optimism, and Mr. Walker had perfected it, scraping by on the odd bits of work that define daily existence for so many people in the profession.</p>
        <p>It was on his trip home to West 43rd Street last Monday that Mr. Walker was fatally struck by a double-decker tour bus at Ninth Avenue and 45th Street, setting off a wave of outrage against the operator of the bus, problem-ridden New York Apple Tours.</p>
        <p>The reaction in theater circles was more than anger or sadness at seeing a 71-year-old man struck down. New York's acting rank and file, who live the rare highs and relentless lows of the city's performing arts, had lost one of their own.</p>
        <p>To some workaday actors Mr. Walker was a familiar face from countless casting calls for ''mature man, 60 to 75.'' To others he was a gracious fellow cast member, happy to mentor and befriend younger colleagues. To the actors who knew him as Ran, and even those who didn't know him at all, Mr. Walker embodied their struggle: a working actor aiming for the big break even as he tries to make ends meet, a devoted performer willing to take roles in remote dinner theaters or obscure downtown workshops because of a love of the stage, a survivor who -- with the exception of a couple of Christmases on the sales floor at Brooks Brothers -- proved it was possible to tough it out without waiting tables or working for a temp agency.</p>
        <p>''There are so many actors who don't work at all, and here was a guy who supported himself as an actor,'' said Todd Heughens, 38, who became close friends with Mr. Walker 14 years ago while working on a Boston production of ''1776.'' ''So I think he took great pride in that.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Walker in many ways typified the life of a certain tier of New York actor. He lived in Manhattan Plaza, the government-subsidized apartment complex mainly for performing artists on West 43rd Street where tenants pay 30 percent of their income as rent, an amount adjusted annually. Generally, a friend estimated, Mr. Walker paid about $500 a month for his 18th-floor studio overlooking the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>He went to the theater whenever he could, availing himself of the occasional discounts available to members of the profession. Sometimes Mr. Walker would be invited to final dress rehearsals, known as gypsy runs, by friends in the cast.</p>
        <p>Aside from playing a minor role in one Broadway show, Mr. Walker worked at a level that included dinner theaters, which generally pay $300 to $600 a week; print advertisements, which can pay $100 to $500; and workshop productions, which often don't pay at all. Despite painful dry spells, Mr. Walker always got another job eventually. His income, though, fluctuated from year to year.</p>
        <p>''He could land a tour and have a good year,'' Mr. Heughens said, ''but he could have a year where he earned under $30,000.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker had to work 20 weeks of the year to get unemployment insurance. His main concern was reaching that cutoff -- and, with the exception of one year, he always did. This hurdle aside, Mr. Walker was consumed with getting auditions and then making the most of them. Even knowing the odds, friends say, he would get his hopes up every time.</p>
        <p>''He had a lot of auditions but also a lot of rejections,'' said Stephen J. Morello, 82, his companion of 21 years. ''You know how the theater is -- you have to be a certain age and have a certain look.''</p>
        <p>Because his survival depended on working, Mr. Walker never turned anything down. Six feet tall and 165 pounds, with gray hair and brown eyes and a resonant voice, he was generally cast in small character parts. Butlers, undertakers and Scrooges were his bread and butter.</p>
        <p>In a regional production of the musical ''Annie,'' for example, he played Drake, the head butler; in a regional ''Man From La Mancha,'' the innkeeper. He also did a few turns on soap operas like ''As the World Turns'' and ''One Life to Live.'' Mr. Heughens, now an art director, described this as ''under-five work,'' when actors are hired for the day and have fewer than five lines.</p>
        <p>Robert Petito, who directed Mr. Walker in plays produced by his former Off Off Broadway acting company and now runs La Stanza Verde, a restaurant on Theater Row, said that ''people like Ran get lost in the shuffle.''</p>
        <p>''He should have been doing so much more dramatic work or sophisticated comedy,'' Mr. Petito said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker was happy to travel to Muskegon, Mich., to play a couple of roles in ''Camelot'' or to be a judge in a background scene in one of the ''Godfather'' movies or to portray a man who founded an evaporated-milk company in a television commercial or to be the taped tour guide for the Museum of the City of New York.</p>
        <p>''He usually played funeral directors,'' said Michael Hartig, Mr. Walker's agent, who represented the actor for about 20 years. ''He had a very charactery look, right out of the movies in the 40's. If he had gone to Hollywood, he would have had a big career.''</p>
        <p>There are many different union contracts for actors based on a production's venue, and Mr. Walker usually worked at one of the lowest pay scales. Casting directors, who ultimately send their recommendations on to the director of a production, say that Mr. Walker seemed to feel that nothing was beneath him.</p>
        <p>''The money was less important,'' said Steven DeAngelis, a casting director at Grey Worldwide, the advertising agency, who cast Mr. Walker in various parts. ''He was willing to audition for every kind of job. A lot of actors' first words are: 'What contract is it? How much is it paying?'  His were: 'Who wrote the music? Who is the director?' ''</p>
        <p>What made all the anonymous bit parts worthwhile were the occasional meaty roles Mr. Walker landed in serious plays -- even if they were produced in out-of-the-way places for no pay. ''Ran was the kind of performer for whom the work was the reward, the process was the reward,'' Mr. DeAngelis said.</p>
        <p>Friends say that Mr. Walker was particularly proud of the performance he gave in the Heritage Theater Company's production of ''Taking Sides'' last month at the United States Custom House in Lower Manhattan, where, for $3 a day in car fare, he played Wilhelm Furtwangler, the controversial German conductor who did not join the Nazi party but sympathized with aspects of the totalitarian regime.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker apparently found the experience of having a leading role was disorienting. ''He hadn't done a role of that size in so many years,'' Mr. Heughens said. ''He kept saying, 'How am I going to remember the lines?' ''</p>
        <p>It was a workshop production for invited guests. In a letter to the theater company's founder and artistic director, Thomas Luce Summa, Rhoda Nathan, president of the Bernard Shaw Society, wrote: ''I thought that Randolph Walker's Furtwangler was extraordinary. He managed to break your heart and generate skepticism about his behavior at the same time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker had been a charter member of the Heritage, an Off Off Broadway company, for 30 years. Mr. Summa said his company had for the last five years been planning to do ''The Merchant of Venice" with Mr. Walker in the role of Shylock, but Mr. Walker kept having to pass in favor of projects that paid the rent. ''Every time we'd start, Ran would get a part,'' Mr. Summa said.</p>
        <p>''He did so many small parts in musicals. His part in 'The King and I' on Broadway was a small part. It wasn't a challenge.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, appearing on Broadway once -- as Mr. Walker did as Sir Edward Ramsay in the 1976 revival of ''The King and I,'' with Yul Brynner -- can be a mixed blessing, Mr. Heughens said, ''like your career peaked.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Hartig sent Mr. Walker out on various casting calls, friends say Mr. Walker also hustled on his own, combing the trade papers for auditions, keeping in touch with directors he had worked with about whether there might be a role for him in their future projects.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker was tough on himself. ''He wished he was a little more ambitious,'' Mr. Heughens said. ''Maybe he could have made a little more of a name for himself or worried about money a little bit less.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker belonged to a small circle of older men who go up for the same parts, regularly running into one another in the waiting room outside the casting room door. Nevertheless, the people who were part of this group say Mr. Walker was noncompetitive in the extreme, that he told his friends about roles he was seeking so they could try to get them also, that he was happy for them even when they won parts he had wanted.</p>
        <p>''We competed a couple of times for roles,'' said Keith Perry, 69, a fellow actor who became a friend. ''We shared disappointments. There was never a jealousy in Ran.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker also gained a reputation for mentoring younger cast members. ''When he worked on shows, they would gravitate toward him,'' Mr. Hartig said. ''He was kind of like Santa Claus. He always had time to talk to them, to share his knowledge and his expertise.''</p>
        <p>In large part, those who knew Mr. Walker say, this generosity stemmed from the fact that Mr. Walker simply felt lucky to be working in the theater after so many years of having stayed away. Soon after his 1951 marriage to a fellow drama student he met during freshman year at Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla., Mr. Walker left the theater to become a banker. ''I think he realized it was almost impossible to make a living that way,'' said Eleanor Walker, the actor's former wife.</p>
        <p>The Walkers had two children, a son who died at 16 in a fire and a daughter, Katharine Hoffman, who lives in a Chicago suburb with her husband, Richard, and their two teenage sons.</p>
        <p>After his divorce in 1976, Mr. Walker came to New York to try to return to professional acting. ''I think he felt like his whole life had started all over again,'' said Nagle Jackson, former artistic director of the McCarter Theater Center in Princeton, N.J., who in 1990 directed Mr. Walker in his adaptation of ''A Tale of Two Cities.'' (Reviewing the play for The New York Times, Wilborn Hampton said Mr. Walker ''presents a detestably wheedling Barsad.'')</p>
        <p>Although years ago he had a triple bypass operation, Mr. Walker had a youthful spirit and seemed strong. He and Mr. Morello traveled every year together and had been planning a trip to Venice in September.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Walker did not look at his acting career as a model for up-and-coming actors, friends say it was a shining example to many of them nonetheless.</p>
        <p>''This is a life you choose, and he chose this life and he was going to make it work,'' Mr. Heughens said. ''Sure, he would rather be doing a Broadway show, but if that didn't come his way, he wasn't going to chuck it all, either.''</p>
