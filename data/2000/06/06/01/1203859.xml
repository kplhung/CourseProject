        <p>CAREY HOFFMAN describes himself as a weather nut.</p>
        <p>Twice in the last three years, Mr. Hoffman, a public information officer at the University of Cincinnati, has taken off from work to attend a severe-weather symposium at Ohio State University ''for fun and entertainment,'' he wrote in an e-mail note. Since he was 9 years old and a tornado touched down one block from his house in the suburbs of Cincinnati, Mr. Hoffman has been in hot pursuit of information about the weather.</p>
        <p>''The day we got cable TV was a great day,'' said Mr. Hoffman, who saw his first radar screen displaying weather information on a local cable channel. The debut of the Weather Channel in 1982 was another bright day for Mr. Hoffman.</p>
        <p>But it is the Internet that has made Mr. Hoffman and others like him feel as if they are in weather paradise. Using several elaborate sites, a weather fanatic can keep tabs on the temperature, the barometric pressure, the wind speed, even the movement of storm clouds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoffman now pursues his hobby by checking a half dozen sites on a stormy day. He particularly enjoys exploring the Web site of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (www.noaa.gov).</p>
        <p>NOAA, part of the Commerce Department, is the parent agency of the National Weather Service, and its site is a favorite among meteorologists and weather fanatics.</p>
        <p>On the site, Mr. Hoffman said, he finds forecasters discussing severe storms with one another. ''It's somewhat scientific, but they talk more openly than what they're going to tell the public,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoffman's obsession does not surprise those who provide weather information. Weather, they said, is simply fascinating. ''It's a 24-hour story,'' said Joel N. Myers, president and founder of AccuWeather, a forecasting service.</p>
        <p>Decker Anstrom, chief executive of the Weather Channel, said, ''The unpredictability of weather and forecasts' being wrong is what keeps people interested in the weather.''</p>
        <p>Organizations ranging from the National Weather Service to private forecasting companies and television stations are trying to muscle in on the Weather Channel and grab the attention of weather enthusiasts with their Web sites. The advantage of the Internet, the organizations said, is instantaneous, updated, personalized weather information.</p>
        <p>The sites, including AccuWeather, (www.accuweather.com), Weather Services International (www.intellicast.com) and Automated Weather Source (www.aws /instaweather.asp), are providing more detailed, more colorful and more graphic information. Not to be outdone, the Weather Channel also has an elaborate site, www.weather.com.</p>
        <p>These sites are useful to people whose interest in the weather starts and stops with wanting to know if they need an umbrella that day. But for weather fanatics, the sites are the mother lode. They show real-time satellite weather photos, current temperatures for cities around the world, wind speeds on the ocean, tornado watches on the plains.</p>
        <p>Unlike television broadcasts -- even the Weather Channel -- and radio reports where you have to wait for a forecast, the Web sites offer continually updated information.</p>
        <p>Many sites offer what has been referred to as now-casting or personal weather views. At intellicast.com, for example, weather reports are intended for hobbyists with weather-related interests, like sailors, golfers and amateur astronomers.</p>
        <p>While National Weather Service forecasts (which can be found on these sites as well) depict what the weather is at the airport, the commercial sites can take microviews, zeroing in on a particular town or a street. The sites are designed to allow users to get information quickly; travelers, for instance, can easily find the 10-day forecast for their destination.</p>
        <p>One such service is AWS's WeatherBug (www.weatherbug/aws), a free service that PC users can download onto their computers. When severe weather has been forecast, a weather icon alerts the user. The service is about a month old and has about 31,000 subscribers. The average user has been clicking in 13 times a day, said Stephanie M. Blozy, a meteorologist at AWS, formally known as Automated Weather Source. Users of Web-enabled cell phones and organizers like the Palm VII can download the free AWS WeatherNet software for access to weather information on the go.</p>
        <p>A particular favorite with weather hobbyists is weather.gov, the National Weather Service page that says 10,000 weather sites link to it. Here, users can scan for warnings of severe weather around the world and  check the latest satellite pictures and even 3-D images of potential hurricanes. The site is extensive. As Mr. Hoffman found, the deeper into the site you go, the more technical the information becomes.</p>
        <p>To prepare forecasts, the National Weather Service and the Federal Aviation Administration collect data from weather stations at most airports and other sites once every hour. Weather instruments -- everything from thermometers and barometers to satellites, weather ballons and Doppler radar -- are used to gather information. Doppler radar detects the location and intensity of rain, snow and other forms of precipitation.</p>
        <p>Meteorologists at the National Weather Service and some independent weather companies, like AccuWeather and the Weather Channel, run the weather service information through computer models that generate forecasts. Meteorologists then interpret the data. The information is packaged and sent to media organizations and is also put on Web sites.</p>
        <p>Local meteorologists often gather additional information to compile forecasts. The data is culled from instruments, including Doppler radar owned by the broadcast stations, and from local weather stations, including one or more of roughly 4,000 schools set up with instruments through a program sponsored by AWS through its School WeatherNet program.</p>
        <p>Despite the vast amount of information, weather forecasting is still inexact.</p>
        <p>''The average user doesn't understand the degree of uncertainty behind this,'' said Dr. Mark S. Monmonier, professor of geography at Syracuse University and author of ''Air Apparent: How Meteorologists Learned to Map, Predict and Dramatize Weather'' (University of Chicago Press, 1999).</p>
        <p>Dr. Monmonier likened weather forecasting to a horse race where one forecaster places all bets on one horse (one weather prediction model) while other forecasters use different models.</p>
        <p>Linda Church, a longtime television meteorologist in Manhattan, said, ''Models of the atmosphere include wind speed, humidity, and temperature of the atmosphere at different heights.'' One model might indicate rain in the morning, Ms. Church said, while another might predict rain later in the day.  Accuweather.com is testing a streaming feature called ''point-counterpoint,'' in which meteorologists debate forecasts.</p>
        <p>When the forecasts are wrong, some people get angry, Dr. Monmonier said. ''The difficulty stems from the tendency of the general public to think that because we are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on high tech that it will remove uncertainty,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mel Goldstein, a meteorologist, said, ''Accuracy is around 85 percent today, and it was 85 percent accurate 85 years ago.'' Dr. Goldstein is a former professor of meteorology at Western Connecticut State University, a meteorologist at WTNH television in New Haven and the author of ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Weather'' (Alpha Books, 1999).</p>
        <p>''We're talking about a 24-hour forecast,'' Dr. Goldstein said. ''Most of the time it's easy to predict the weather -- you look out the window. But during rapidly developing weather situations the forecast accuracy falls far below that 85 percent, and unfortunately, those are the occasions when most people are watching.''</p>
        <p>Some elements of forecasts, however, have become more accurate. A five-day forecast today is as accurate as a three-day forecast 10 or 15 years ago, said Jim Candor, a vice president of AccuWeather. And these forecasts are far more detailed, far beyond the old ''clear and sunny tomorrow, temps in the high 60's.''</p>
        <p>Dr. D. James Baker, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said even more accuracy and detail are in the offing. ''Better and more accurate data and higher speed and better computers to take in all the data and tell us where weather will happen'' will result in better forecasts, he said.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, weather enthusiasts will have to choose from the information that is already available, unless, of course, they prefer to make their own forecasts, like Roger Perry. Mr. Perry, an eighth grade science teacher at the Plymouth Community Intermediate School in Plymouth, Mass., has a weather station at the school.</p>
        <p>Along with the standard instruments, Mr. Perry has two receivers for NOAA weather satellite information, a live weather radar feed, five weather stations with logs for data, lightning detection antennas and all-day connections to the Internet. And a television in Mr. Perry's weather station is tuned in to the Weather Channel.</p>
        <p>''We have a live weather radar image running in real time,'' Mr. Perry said. With all of this kind of data, he added, ''anybody can make a forecast.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Perry and his students extend their weather activities beyond the classroom. They serve as spotters for the weather service, a loosely knit group of enthusiasts who watch for severe weather and report their observations. They also offer weather information to local cranberry growers and the nuclear power plant in town.</p>
        <p>Despite his interest and his equipment, Mr. Perry said he would still like more information. To him, there can never be enough weather information. That, he says, makes him a true weather nut.</p>
        <p>The Tools</p>
        <p>Equipment for Amateur Forecasters</p>
        <p>ACCORDING to Roger Perry, a science teacher at the Plymouth Community Intermediate School in Plymouth, Mass., weather forecasting is simple, once you have set yourself up with the right equipment and access to information.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perry said that ''a good Internet connection and a list of weather information Internet sites,'' starting with  weather.gov, a National Weather Service site, can point an amateur forecaster in the right direction.</p>
        <p>The following equipment is also helpful:</p>
        <p>* An outdoor thermometer that will record the minimum and maximum temperatures for the day.</p>
        <p>* Wind speed and direction instruments.</p>
        <p>* A barometer to measure air pressure.</p>
        <p>* A four-inch plastic rain gauge.</p>
        <p>* A yardstick or meter stick to measure snowfall.</p>
        <p>* A shelter to protect the instruments from heating up on sunny days.</p>
        <p>* A weather log chart.</p>
        <p>* A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather radio, which can receive high-frequency weather broadcasts.</p>
        <p>Thermometers and rain gauges can be found for as little as a dollar, but Mr. Perry suggested using sturdier equipment. These can be found on the Web at sites of companies that sell weather instruments, including Maximum Inc. (www.maximum-inc.com); the Weather Store (www.wxstore.com), a folksy site offering weathervanes and weather stations; and Davis Instruments (www  .davisnet.com), which sells home weather stations, some of which can be linked to a personal computer. Lightning detectors are for sale at Stormwise (www.stormwise.com), a site specializing in these instruments.</p>
        <p>For the true weather fanatic, individual weather satellite receivers and other weather information systems can be purchased through Zephyrus Electronics (www.big-z.com), DTN Kavouras Weather Services (www.dtn.com  /weather) and Alden ELectronics (www.alden.com), among others. These sites cater mostly to industrial and commercial users but will sell to individuals.</p>
