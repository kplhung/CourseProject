        <p>The audience and the temperature had fallen precipitously since their last meeting, but the United States and China played another riveting match in women's soccer early yesterday morning in Canberra, Australia. Again, the match was decided by penalty kicks. This time, however, China prevailed.</p>
        <p>Four minutes from the end of regulation, the Chinese forward Sun Wen got tangled with defender Danielle Slaton and the two fell down in the penalty area. China was awarded a penalty kick, and Sun calmly placed her shot in the upper right corner for a 1-0 victory.</p>

        <p>The last time these teams played, July 10, 1999, they drew the largest audience ever to watch a women's sporting event -- 90,185 at the Rose Bowl for the final of the Women's World Cup. This match, held in the first round of the Pacific Cup tournament, was played before an estimated 550 fans. And those summer temperatures that had risen above 100 degrees on the Rose Bowl turf had dipped to freezing in the Southern Hemisphere's late autumn.</p>
