        <p>Of all the stock characters in 20th-century English literature, few have survived in the public's imagination with greater tenacity than the inebriated Irishman, and the Irish Arts Center is offering a model of the stereotype with a revival of J. P. Donleavy's stage version of ''The Ginger Man'' by the Dublin Theater Company. Unfortunately, the specimen we encounter in the play, especially in the current production, emerges more as a garden-variety drunk than the boozy charmer Mr. Donleavy created first in a novel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donleavy's enchantment with Ireland began after World War II. The American son of well-to-do Irish immigrants, he attended Trinity College, Dublin, on the G.I. Bill.</p>
        <p>His novel follows the fortunes of Sebastian Dangerfield -- the ginger man of the title and an upper-middle-class Irish-American studying at Trinity -- as he carouses around Dublin in the late 1940's. It is pretty tame stuff by today's standards, but the book was briefly banned when it came out in 1955, and it made Mr. Donleavy something of a celebrity. His own stage version of the novel ran for a few weeks on Broadway in 1963.</p>
        <p>When we first meet Sebastian in the play, he is already saddled with an English wife, Marion, and an infant daughter whose milk money he spends on gin. He is ostensibly studying law, but his main occupation is avoiding the landlord and other creditors while sponging off a fellow Irish-American, Kenneth, also in Dublin to attend college and, at 27, to finally lose his virginity.</p>
        <p>Most of the first act is given to rows between Sebastian and Marion, many of which in this staging by Ronan Wilmot inexplicably take place offstage in the wings. When Marion finally gets the gumption and wherewithal to leave Sebastian, he follows and sweet-talks himself into her new flat.</p>
        <p>But the short-lived reunion is spoiled by the presence of a boarder Marion has taken in named Lily Frost who is more than willing to be seduced by Sebastian. It's hard to imagine that any of this was once shocking to readers or theatergoers.</p>
        <p>Among the many problems with the Dublin Theater Company staging is David Murray's portrayal of Sebastian as an obnoxious lout rather than a romantic dreamer. One would assume that Sebastian had a certain beguiling way about him -- why else would Marion take him back? -- but in Mr. Murray's performance he is simply a bounder who speaks either loud or louder. Even his shouted threats at his wife are difficult to take seriously despite references to his having beaten her and thrown her downstairs during her pregnancy.</p>
        <p>With the exception of Julie Hale, who has moments as Marion, the rest of the cast is equally unconvincing. Neither Karl Hayden as Kenneth nor Mary McEvoy as Miss Frost bring energy to their performances. In fact, the entire staging by Mr. Wilmot is as flat as day-old stout and has all the polish of an acting-class exercise. This is a ''Ginger Man'' that seems to have forgotten to add the ginger.</p>
