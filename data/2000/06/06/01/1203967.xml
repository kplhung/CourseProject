        <p>In the tax-fraud trial of Albert J. Pirro Jr. and his brother and accountant, Anthony G. Pirro, federal prosecutors have focused almost entirely on Albert, the Westchester County lawyer and power broker whose high-flying life style has been the subject of much of the testimony so far.</p>
        <p>But today Anthony Pirro briefly emerged from the shadows as prosecutors drew testimony from Albert  Pirro's executive assistant, Debra Cain, about Anthony Pirro's appearances at his brother's White Plains law office.</p>

        <p>In the tax-fraud trial of Albert J. Pirro Jr. and his brother and accountant, Anthony G. Pirro, federal prosecutors have focused almost entirely on Albert, the Westchester County lawyer and power broker whose high-flying life style has been the subject of much of the testimony so far.</p>
        <p>But today Anthony Pirro briefly emerged from the shadows as prosecutors drew testimony from Albert  Pirro's executive assistant, Debra Cain, about Anthony Pirro's appearances at his brother's White Plains law office.</p>
        <p>The brothers are accused of improperly deducting more than $1.2 million in personal expenses as business expenditures on Albert Pirro's tax returns from 1988 to 1997. Albert Pirro is the husband of Jeanine F. Pirro, Westchester County's district attorney.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cain testified today that until prosecutors began issuing subpoenas in 1997, Anthony Pirro showed up once a week at the law firm and typically spent a half-day going over check stubs, invoices and ledgers.</p>
        <p>Elliott B. Jacobson, the lead prosecutor, said: ''All of those checks were made available to Anthony Pirro when he came to the office weekly. So if there was a personal notation on the check, it was there for him to see?''</p>
        <p>''Correct,'' Ms. Cain said.</p>
        <p>Those notations were Ms. Cain's jottings in the memo line of a company check or on a ledger, indicating that the payment was for a personal or household item. In one instance, Ms. Cain's testimony suggested, Albert Pirro directed her to pay the $3,993 bill for a private flight in 1994 to his child's summer camp in Maine, using a check from one of his 33 companies.</p>
        <p>But in another instance, Ms. Cain said she had deposited $900 from Mr. Pirro's personal account into a company account and then used a company check to pay a painter for work done on the Pirro house in Harrison, N.Y. Ms. Cain said she could not recall who had directed her to do that.</p>
