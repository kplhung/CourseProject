        <p>Palestinians prisoners in Israeli jails ended a monthlong hunger strike today, averting a further round of street protests that many here had feared could derail peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.</p>
        <p>In a compromise forged by the authority's Ministry for Prisoners' Affairs, Israel granted the inmates more liberal family visitation and moved five out of solitary confinement, among other concessions. Some 500 prisoners who had been on a liquid diet for 31 days called off the protest, though they continued to demand that other inmates be freed from solitary confinement.</p>
        <p>Demonstrations in the West Bank and Gaza in favor of the prisoners erupted into violence last week, leading to a suspension of peace talks and to gunbattles with the Israeli military that left six Palestinians dead.</p>
        <p>The peace talks, which had been held in Stockholm, are to resume in an unannounced location ''in the Middle East'' as soon as Thursday, Israeli state radio said. President Clinton and Prime Minister Ehud Barak are to discuss the talks Thursday in Portugal, in a meeting that was originally planned for Berlin.</p>
        <p>Palestinian officials hailed the deal today as a belated Israeli recognition of the extreme sensitivity of the prisoners issue. But they repeated demands for the release of some 500 Palestinians who have been held in Israeli prisons for crimes of political violence since before the May 1994 start of land-for-peace negotiations with Israel.</p>
        <p>''I am not fully satisfied, but the significant thing is that this was a clear message from the Palestinian people that the prisoners' cause is fundamental and needs to be resolved,'' said Qadoura Fares, a Palestinian legislator who helped negotiate the compromise. ''I believe the Israelis understood the message.''</p>
        <p>Hundreds of protesters encamped for the past month in plazas throughout the Palestinian territories had also been fasting in support of the striking prisoners. The protests were called off today, Issa Qarake, a chief organizer, announced in Bethlehem.</p>
        <p>''The solidarity activities in the street helped the prisoners to achieve their main demands,'' Mr. Qarake said.</p>
        <p>Among the concessions extracted by Palestinian negotiators was the right of young children to have brief visits with imprisoned parents unimpeded by barred barriers. Prisoners will also now be allowed to make telephone calls to families on special occasions like weddings and funerals, and to pursue studies with Palestinian universities, officials said.</p>
        <p>Israel released some 360 long-term prisoners over the past year in accord with agreements negotiated with the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian negotiators are asking Israel to release 230 more pre-1994 prisoners who they say were not directly involved with fatal attacks against Israelis -- the key Israeli criterion for their possible release.</p>
