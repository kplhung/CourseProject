        <p>Feeling the effects of rising interest rates, DaimlerChrysler announced today that it would eliminate most low-rate loans on new Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth automobiles on Thursday and instead offer bigger cash rebates to consumers and new discounts to dealers.</p>
        <p>For most models, DaimlerChrysler currently offers customers a choice of a cash rebate or a loan at a subsidized rate of 1.9 percent to 6.9 percent. The company plans, however, to stop offering low-rate loans nationally, although it will still offer them in some highly competitive markets, notably in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler's shift in strategy is an indication that the Federal Reserve's six increases in short-term interest rates are beginning to put pressure on the auto industry. Economists say that one reason the Fed's rate increases have not had more effect on auto sales until now is that automakers have been offsetting the higher rates. Automakers make low-rate loans available by paying subsidies to banks and other providers of car loans.</p>
        <p>Automakers say that the Fed's rate increases have begun to slow auto sales, however, with the industry likely to post May results on Thursday that will show the first drop in year-to-year sales since the summer of 1998, when a strike crippled General Motors. While the drop is expected to be just 2 percent or so, and while sales remain at a level that would have been considered extremely strong until the last couple of years, the drop could nonetheless be a sign that the auto market has turned.</p>
        <p>The Fed's rate increases have led to increases in retail loans, making it very expensive for automakers to hold down rates on auto loans through subsidies to lenders, according to Theodor R. Cunningham, DaimlerChrysler's executive vice president for global sales and marketing. DaimlerChrysler anticipates that short-term rates will rise another half a percentage point to a full percentage point by the end of this year, which could have made low-rate loans even more expensive if the company had not switched to a greater reliance on rebates, he added.</p>
        <p>''This is part of a long-term strategy of shifting to get our investment in incentives directly into the hands of consumers instead of financial institutions,'' Mr. Cunningham said during a telephone conference call with reporters this afternoon. The new policy on incentives will be in effect throughout June, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cunningham said that it was not possible to calculate the effect of the new policy on the company's total costs for discounts. The discounts will be based on how many more vehicles each dealership sells in June than in previous months.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler had very few incentives in May, and sales plunged 15 percent in the weeks leading up to the Memorial Day weekend. Joseph S. Phillippi, an auto analyst at PaineWebber, said that while DaimlerChrysler's new approach would raise the company's costs, it might be cheaper than a return to the discount programs that DaimlerChrysler had earlier this year and which the Ford Motor Company and the G.M. continue to offer.</p>
        <p>''You have to scratch your head and wonder what's going to happen when we have even a 5 percent downturn, which is not that big -- it's going to get ugly out there,'' Mr. Phillippi said.</p>
        <p>G.M. and Ford officials said that they would study DaimlerChrysler's approach. Foreign automakers offer fewer rebates, preferring to set prices in line with market demand instead of setting prices high and then discounting them.</p>
        <p>The new DaimlerChrysler rebates for consumers are largest on models that have not been updated for several years and are about to be replaced. The rebate on the Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivan, for example, rises to $2,000 from an already hefty $1,750. DaimlerChrysler also announced a $1,000 rebate on Dodge Durango sport utility vehicles with 4.7-liter and 5.2-liter engines and a $2,000 rebate on Durangos with 5.8-liter engines. There would be rebates on all models except the Chrysler PT Cruiser, Dodge Viper, Dodge Dakota Quad Cab and Plymouth Prowler.</p>
        <p>Until recently, consumers were snapping up the biggest sport utility vehicles. Mr. Cunningham said rising gasoline prices had begun to erode demand for the largest sport utilities and increased demand for small cars, but that the Fed's rate increases had been a bigger factor.</p>
