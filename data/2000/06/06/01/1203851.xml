        <p>The three angels wear shorts and Hawaiian print shirts and carry luggage. They sing nice harmony too, but that's not their special appeal. These angels are of particular interest to audiences at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven because one of them is fixated on getting to the trolley museum.</p>
        <p>Although the angel never spells it out, he means the Shoreline Trolley Museum, a popular tourist attraction in nearby East Haven. ''The Good Person of New Haven,'' which concludes its five-week run on June 4, is the Long Wharf's affectionate if slightly left-handed tribute to its home city, and on its own unusual terms the production generally succeeds.</p>
        <p>When Bertolt Brecht wrote ''The Good Woman of Szechwan'' during World War II, the play's central question -- is it possible to be a good and moral human being in a world that is neither? -- seemed like a global issue rather than a local one. In 2000 that's no longer the case. So even if ''The Good Person of New Haven'' sometimes comes off as just an exercise in boosterism, it is at least a timely one.</p>
        <p>In the original play, set in China, a prostitute is the only person in town willing to give overnight shelter to three strangers who turn out to be gods. As a reward for her unselfishness, they present the woman, Shen Te, with a thousand silver dollars; at least this way she will be able to leave her unsavory line of work.</p>
        <p>With the money Shen Te buys a tobacco shop but soon finds herself so bombarded with freeloaders that she has to invent a much tougher alter ego (an imaginary male cousin, Shui Ta) to deal with them. She falls in love with Yang Sun, an out-of-work pilot, and gives her money to him. She is soon pregnant, alone at the altar and deeply in debt. The moral test continues.</p>
        <p>In the Long Wharf's version, Alison Carey's adaptation for a monotheistic culture, the gods are angels, and the prostitute is Tyesha Shore (Patrice Johnson), a young black woman dressed all in red (leather jacket, microminiskirt and ankle boots). With the $10,000 the angels give her, Tyesha buys a minimart. Pretty soon a family of eight is sleeping there and customers are demanding free cigarettes.</p>
        <p>To become her hard-nosed, business-savvy cousin, Taiwo Highwater, she simply puts on men's clothes and ties her hair into a ponytail. The water seller, who functions as a narrator of sorts in the original play, has become Quinn (Christopher Liam Moore), a homeless man with a grocery cart full of cans. The man Tyesha loves is Eddie (Raul E. Esparza), an out-of-work railroad man who never really cares about her. Just like Shen Te, she ends up abandoned and pregnant with big money problems and deep conflict over how to behave honorably without losing everything.</p>
        <p>To make ''The Good Person of New Haven'' a genuine community project, the Long Wharf has cast local residents rather than professional actors in 24 of the 34 roles. So, along with regular members of the company, the program lists people like Adelaida Nunez of Fair Haven, Conn.; Milton R. Cohen of Wooster Square; and Daniel John Kelly of East Norwalk. The use of the amateurs is smartly handled. Bill Rauch, the director, has put them in crowd scenes and musical numbers, and to his credit and that of Cornerstone Theater Company, which specializes in community theater projects like this, the novices never stand out like the sore thumbs they could have been.</p>
        <p>Among the professional actors in smaller roles, two stand out: Carol A. Honda, as Mrs. Shin, who manages to be adorable while casually stealing the minimart blind; and Jeffery V. Thompson, as the Reverend Marsh, the oversize ''man with real estate'' who wants to save Tyesha by marrying her. He makes his first entrance in a leprechaun-green suit, a yellow shirt and bright yellow shoes.</p>
        <p>The music that punctuates the show is pleasant but undistinguished, with messages like ''Frankly it's just not a real good night'' (the other townspeople's excuse for not giving three angels a bed) and ''Scare me up some junk food; it feels good going down'' (a paean to the minimart's inventory).</p>
        <p>The audience's real favorites are the local jokes, about the likes of ''enterprise zones,'' a wall at the waterfront and dinner at Rumba. The audience also gives a hearty laugh to the reminder that Black Panther rallies were once held at Yale University, a juxtaposition that can make even an out-of-towner smile, and think.</p>
