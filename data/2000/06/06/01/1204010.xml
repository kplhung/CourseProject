        <p>For eight hours after his arrest last week, John Taylor sat with investigators in a second-floor squad room at the 111th Precinct in northern Queens, unwinding the spool of his life, from his childhood in a Brooklyn housing project to what prosecutors charge was his role last week in the execution-style slayings of five people in the basement of a Wendy's on Main Street in Flushing.</p>

        <p>For eight hours after his arrest last week, John Taylor sat with investigators in a second-floor squad room at the 111th Precinct in northern Queens, unwinding the spool of his life, from his childhood in a Brooklyn housing project to what prosecutors charge was his role last week in the execution-style slayings of five people in the basement of a Wendy's on Main Street in Flushing.</p>
        <p>In a voice devoid of emotion, Mr. Taylor detailed the killings, explained how he had acquired the gun, a .380-caliber bought on the streets of Jamaica, and traced his escape route home, cab by cab, investigators said. But they said he never came close to answering the critical question that hung in the interrogation room all night: how a 36-year-old man who once displayed a devoted work ethic, a love for his children and an engaging smile had evolved into someone capable of the carnage that ended an armed robbery.</p>
        <p>''I spoke to a psychiatrist this afternoon, and even with all the information we have, who can say?'' an  investigator said. ''Maybe he thought there was an easier way than working.''</p>
        <p>Even as police and prosecutors amass what they characterize as an overwhelming volume of evidence against Mr. Taylor and his accomplice, Craig Godineaux, law enforcement officials acknowledge that they have gained little insight into what motivated the cold viciousness of the murders, aside from the pair's concession that they had sought to eliminate all witnesses.</p>
        <p>John Taylor's previous crimes, one burglary and a few fast-food-store robberies that the authorities say he admitted to, were brazen, but never violent. The law-breaking began recently, only a few years ago, after Mr. Taylor had built a reputation as a dutiful manager who spent 14 years working in the same McDonald's franchise in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Several investigators acknowledged that perhaps no amount of  psychological theorizing could ever make sense of what happened in the Wendy's in Flushing last Wednesday. But they said the involvement of Mr. Taylor, who is thought to have been the architect of the crime, is particularly baffling. By all outward appearances, his crimes had been aberrations in an adult life unaffected by mental illness, drug addiction or burning grudges.</p>
        <p>He filed his income taxes. He paid Social Security taxes for his baby sitter. He took an accident prevention course last year sponsored by the New York Department of Motor Vehicles. He was known around his former home in Lefrak City as the sort of person who took his four children, two boys and two girls, 5 to 13 years old, to the video store to rent movies like ''The Big Green,'' a family soccer story, and Jackie Chan's latest high-action thriller.</p>
        <p>''John seemed like the kind of guy you would trust with your kids,'' said Edward Wills, who supervised him  for 8 of the 14 years that Mr. Taylor worked as an assistant manager at a McDonald's in Midtown. ''I don't think this is the same John.''</p>
        <p>Those who worked with Mr. Taylor in five fast food stores said that in recent years he had grown sullen and withdrawn, with few close friends. They said he became a strict manager, intolerant of small mistakes, even as he was accused several times by his bosses of filching cash.</p>
        <p>But, as the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, tries to decide whether these killings warrant the death penalty, several investigators said they were most struck by Mr. Taylor's chilling ability to distance himself from the crime. On the day after the killings, for example, he went back to work at a clothing store in Queens, where he was a salesman. That afternoon, he called a 26-year-old woman he had begun courting just nine days before.</p>
        <p>The woman, a receptionist at a tax preparation business in Queens, said Mr. Taylor had seemed to be a decent person but his phone call, in hindsight, was hauntingly odd. He talked briefly about the Knicks, she said, and then he made plans to meet her for dinner either Friday or Saturday night.</p>
        <p>''You figure maybe somebody would act different if they just killed somebody,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Although the authorities have said that Mr. Taylor has confessed to shooting one of the seven people shot that night, he has yet to enter a formal plea in the case. A trial to determine his guilt is still many months away.</p>
        <p>John Benjamin Taylor, who often uses the nickname Benji, was born March 10, 1964, in Kings County Hospital, the first of four children of John and Audrey Taylor. He, his younger brother, Vaughn, and two sisters were raised in an apartment in the Ocean Hill Houses, in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>His parents, who divorced in 1993 after being separated for at least 10 years, declined to be interviewed for this article, as did Mr. Taylor's lawyer, John Youngblood. But the parents have told others that they were stunned by their son's arrest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor's mother, who now uses her birth name, Audrey Saddler, had recognized the Flushing Avenue Wendy's on the news as the place where her son had worked, according to Roy Earl, her boyfriend. Within hours, she was confronted by detectives seeking to question Mr. Taylor.</p>
        <p>''I tried to comfort her and things like that, but she's still in shock,'' Mr. Earl said.</p>
        <p>After his arrest, Mr. Taylor spent hours talking to Detectives Louis Pia, Brian Quinn and Elizabeth Curcio. By his own account, Mr. Taylor has always been closer to his father. He moved from his mother's apartment in Brooklyn to his father's apartment in Lefrak City in 1982 after graduating from East New York Vocational High School. He did not attend the ceremony, he told investigators, because he did not have the money for a cap and gown.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor told detectives that the move was prompted by an argument with his mother, who feared he was  involved in gang activity and might lure his younger brother into trouble. But residents of the Ocean Hill Houses said they recalled that, during an era when gang violence in the projects was growing, John Taylor was routinely seen walking off to work in the uniform of a fast food worker.</p>
        <p>For years, John Taylor seemed to be the more stable of the two brothers. While John was working as an assistant manager at a McDonald's at 34th Street in Manhattan, his brother, Vaughn, was being arrested repeatedly for minor crimes in Suffolk County, where he lived. Since 1992, Vaughn Taylor has been arrested more than three dozen times, according to police records, in most cases on charges of petty larceny or drug use.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor's relationship with both of his parents has deteriorated in recent years.</p>
        <p>Last summer, when he left jail after his arrest on a robbery charge, Mr. Taylor filed a complaint with the police, accusing his father of having stolen all the furniture from his Lefrak City apartment while he was incarcerated.</p>
        <p>He also told the police that he had not seen his mother in at least two years. Mr. Earl said Ms. Saddler kept pictures of her other children, but not of John.</p>
        <p>In the fast-food industry, in which  workers often change jobs frequently, Mr. Taylor was a study in permanence, commuting daily for years from Queens to his job as an assistant manager at the McDonald's at 341 Fifth Avenue, near 34th Street, in Manhattan. He was punctual and polite, and several friends recalled that he talked often of owning his own store.</p>
        <p>But something seemed to change in 1996. There were whispers among co-workers that Mr. Taylor had placed ghost employees on the company payroll. He was transferred to another location at 22 East 42nd Street, although Mr. Wills said the only problem had been that Mr. Taylor's performance had slumped a bit and he wanted to give him a new challenge.</p>
        <p>Several months later, Mr. Taylor was discovered at the Fifth Avenue store at 6 a.m., trying to break into the safe. Mr. Taylor, who said he needed the money for his children, was sentenced to five years' probation. It was his first offense.</p>
        <p>By 1998, he was working as an assistant manager at the Wendy's in Flushing. Some former employees said he was pleasant to work for, but the authorities said he was caught stealing in May 1999 and transferred to another Wendy's in Jackson Heights for several weeks.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the police say they believe that Mr. Taylor, armed with a starter's pistol, embarked on a spree in which he robbed or tried to rob five fast-food restaurants in Queens, beginning with a Burger King at 78-03 Queens Boulevard. In that incident, on June 15, a supervisor went for the phone to call the police and the robber ran off.</p>
        <p>''I guess we were lucky,'' said Edward Bryck, the store manager, ''because this guy doesn't seem to be playing with a full deck.''</p>
        <p>Eight days later, Mr. Taylor was arrested, the police said, after he robbed a McDonald's in Sunnyside for the second time in four days. He was held until August, when he posted $3,500 bail and returned home to Lefrak City to find that his apartment had been emptied of furniture, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Neighbors said he still had a job, however, as a manager at a Wendy's on Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst.  One neighbor, George Gross, said Mr. Taylor amiably helped his daughter get a job at the same store, but she soon found him unsettling.</p>
        <p>''She never complained about anybody the way she complained about him,'' he said. ''She just said: 'He's not right. He is too serious.' ''</p>
        <p>Last October, within a few weeks, Mr. Taylor was evicted from his apartment in Lefrak City and dismissed from his job at Wendy's, the authorities said. At the same time, out on bail in his robbery case, in which prosecutors were pushing for a 12-year prison sentence, he failed to show up for court.</p>
        <p>He then hid in plain sight, taking a room at $85 a week in a private house on 171st Street in Jamaica, only three miles from Queens Supreme Court, where a bench warrant was issued for his rearrest. His landlady, Ruth Hancock, said that during his first weekend at her home, Mr. Taylor's children came to visit him. Otherwise, she said, he lived quietly and neatly and paid his rent promptly.</p>
        <p>He quickly found work a few blocks away, first at a leather goods store and later as a salesman at S C&amp;R Clothing, Mr. Taylor told detectives. He and Mr. Godineaux were both working at the store last week when, the police say, they robbed Wendy's of $2,400 and left seven people for dead in the basement.</p>
        <p>The next day, Thursday, Mr. Taylor showed up for work, leaving at 7:30 p.m. to watch the Knicks game.</p>
        <p>On Friday morning, according to Mr. Taylor's statement to the police, he heard his name broadcast on television as a suspect in the killings, and he decided to flee.</p>
        <p>But first, in an unusual move for a suspect in a multiple murder, he called in sick at the clothing store, said the owner, Anna Biton. She said he told her that his father had died and he had to bury him in South Carolina.</p>
        <p>He then went to the home of his brother's wife in Brentwood, N.Y.,  where he was arrested that day.</p>
        <p>On the way back to Queens, Mr. Taylor began telling the first of several accounts of the killings, a law enforcement official said. It was a story full of facts, but one that shed little light on how Mr. Taylor had come to participate in such violence, the official said.</p>
        <p>Another investigator on the case said he could not imagine any account that would adequately explain the killings.</p>
        <p>''If I could think and understand how someone could do something like that,'' he said, ''then it's time to quit.''</p>
