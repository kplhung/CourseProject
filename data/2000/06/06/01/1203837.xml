        <p>The New 42nd Street Studios, opening June 21, proves that a glass building can have a 21st-century reason for its transparency and not just be a nod to old-fashioned Modernism. The 10-story building, left, is 84,000 square feet, including offices, the Duke on 42nd Street Theater, and studio space for actors, dancers, musicians -- the people who make theater. The glass walls allow passersby to see dancers leaping, actors emoting, and musicians playing their horns.</p>

        <p>The New 42nd Street Studios, opening June 21, proves that a glass building can have a 21st-century reason for its transparency and not just be a nod to old-fashioned Modernism. The 10-story building, left, is 84,000 square feet, including offices, the Duke on 42nd Street Theater, and studio space for actors, dancers, musicians -- the people who make theater. The glass walls allow passersby to see dancers leaping, actors emoting, and musicians playing their horns.</p>
        <p>''Artists are one of New York City's richest resources,'' said Cora Cahan, president of New 42nd Street Inc., the nonprofit agency that oversaw construction of the $29.6 million building, at 229 West 42nd Street. ''Yet, it's increasingly difficult for artists to find affordable places to work. If we get subsidizing, we can rent space for $10 an hour to any dance company with a budget of under $1.5 million.'' At night, each floor will be illuminated by theatrical lights attached to a slender steel armature, above. Colors will wash across perforated steel blades, so that the facade will be ''layered in light and color, and function almost as a lighting fixture,'' said Ray Dovell, of Platt Byard Dovell Architects, the Manhattan firm that designed the building. Anne Militello, from Los Angeles, created the lighting. Super-graphic signage, below, will wrap doors, floors, walls and ceilings ''like a package,'' said Paula Scher, a partner at Pentagram in Manhattan, which designed it.</p>
