        <p>A team of physicists has made a giant leap in understanding a prime scourge of audiences for opera, theater and concerts -- the crinkling and crackling of candy wrappers.</p>
        <p>But the physicists' work will be scant help to audiences maddened by the noise. The team showed what plenty of dismayed concertgoers have already intuited: the noise is inevitable no matter how the candy is opened.</p>
        <p>The research, which will be presented tomorrow in Atlanta at a meeting of the Acoustical Society of America, is the most detailed examination ever of just how and why the mood-destroying noise is generated in the materials that wrap candy.</p>
        <p>The researchers, Dr. Eric Kramer, a physicist at Simon's Rock College in Massachusetts, and Dr. Alexander Lobkovsky of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md., asked why even the most careful, painfully deliberate extraction of a piece of hard candy from its wrapper does not seem to reduce the amount of sound produced as a desperate audience member tries to relieve a dry throat, invariably just as Tosca reaches the sublime pathos of ''Vissi d'Arte.''</p>
        <p>By recording crinkled wrappers as they were slowly stretched out in an otherwise silent chamber, and then digitizing and analyzing the sound emissions on computers, the team found that the noise was not continuous, but consisted of individual bursts or pops just thousandths of a second long. Their loudness, the researchers found, has nothing to do with how fast wrapping is undone. Rather, the pops occur at random volumes as tiny, individual creases in the paper suddenly rearrange  themselves while the candy is unwrapped.</p>
        <p>The physics of wrappers turned out to be surprisingly complex, said Dr. Kramer, who found parallels in the different shapes that large protein molecules can assume in the human body and the properties of magnetic materials. But because the series of minute shape changes from wrapped to unwrapped is unavoidable, the work's implications were tragic news for every alas-poor-Yorick moment of great drama.</p>
        <p>''You can follow that sequence as slowly as you want, but each step in the sequence is accompanied by a click,'' Dr. Kramer said. ''And there's nothing you can do about it.''</p>
        <p>On Broadway, where announced reminders to turn off cell phones and beepers are accompanied by the suggestion that hard candy be unwrapped before the curtain rises, the results may be about as welcome as a bad review. But this parsing of the intricate behavior of such a familiar object will find a ready audience among scientists who study neither atomic nor cosmic realms, but rather the middle ground between the very small and the very large.</p>
        <p>''One, I think, should not confuse familiarity with comprehension,'' said Dr. L. Mahadevan, a mechanical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''This is a rather everyday system, but it has almost any of the complexities that one could care for in any physical system.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Kramer said he no longer remembered exactly why he and Dr. Lobkovsky began recording crinkling plastic. But he said they became intrigued by a fact that most people take for granted: smooth, unwrinkled plastic has only one ''stable'' configuration, since no matter how it is bent (as long as it is not creased), the plastic will fall flat again. But crushed and wrinkled plastic has innumerable stable states: deform it, and it holds the shape or something close to it.</p>
        <p>So the researchers recorded the noises emitted during the slow stretching of a common plastic that they had crushed and recrushed many times. ''As far as we know, no one had ever looked at this sound before,'' Dr. Kramer said. They were surprised to find an irregular series of extremely brief pops with unpredictable energies that varied by a factor of hundreds of thousands.</p>
        <p>In creating a theory of wrappers, the researchers found a parallel in the rolling of a boulder over a hilly, irregular landscape. Different wrapper conformations correspond to the boulder's rolling into different depressions in the landscape. And like a theatergoer gradually opening a wrapper, someone might push the boulder very slowly up a hill. Nevertheless, at some point it will tumble quickly down the other side -- and, in the case of the wrapper, emit that irritating snap.</p>
        <p>As homely as that process is, it has much in common with a large drug molecule that behaves differently in the body, depending on what shape it takes, said Dr. James Kakalios, a physicist at the University of Minnesota. ''If we understood that, it would have a revolutionary impact on everybody's life,'' since a new generation of therapeutic drugs could be engineered, he said.</p>
        <p>But what does the research say about how to unwrap a piece of hard candy when, horribly, a tickle in the throat arrives during the final, fading bars of Tchaikovsky's ''Pathetique''?</p>
        <p>''Unwrap it as quickly as possible and get it over with,'' Dr. Kramer said.</p>
