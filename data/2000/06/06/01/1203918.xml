        <p>The Nets are having discussions with Rod Thorn, the National Basketball Association's executive vice president of basketball operations, about his becoming their president and director of basketball, according to a YankeeNets official. Thorn joins a list of candidates that includes John Thompson, Isiah Thomas and Mitch Kupchak, but has emerged as the team's top choice, according to the official.</p>
        <p>Neither Thorn nor Lewis Katz, the Nets' principal owner, could be reached for comment, and Harvey Schiller, the YankeeNets chairman, was vague when asked about Thorn. Schiller did say, however, that he expects the team to reach a hiring decision soon.</p>
        <p>''My guess is that it's going to move pretty quickly in the next couple of days,'' Schiller said. ''That really is up to Lewis in terms of the final decision.''</p>
        <p>The Nets approached Thorn last fall about becoming their president. In order to keep Thorn in the league office, the N.B.A. promoted him from senior vice president to his current position.</p>
        <p>An official in the Eastern Conference who has a close relationship with Thorn said he had second thoughts about his decision to reject the Nets' offer and may now join the team. ''That's very viable,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''The Nets' job is his if he wants it.''</p>
        <p>If Thorn becomes the Nets' president and director of basketball, he would bring the league-wide credibility the club has been seeking to attain with this hire. One YankeeNets official stated recently that the franchise's history of failure and mismanagement was somewhat of an obstacle in obtaining legitimate candidates for its front office positions. Hiring Thorn would immediately change that perception.</p>
        <p>David Kahn, the general manager of the Indiana Pacers, was in the running for the president's job, but he removed his name from consideration yesterday.</p>
        <p>''The timing just isn't right for myself or for my family,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Nets have also been speaking with Thompson about a position in their basketball operations department, but if Thorn takes the job, Thompson would not seem to fit into the picture. Michael Jackson, who played for Thompson at Georgetown and spent a couple of seasons in the N.B.A., will have a small role in the basketball operation before moving to the television side when the YankeeNets' new network is in place.</p>
