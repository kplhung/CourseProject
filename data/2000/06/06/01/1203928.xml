        <p>Syria is ready to accept Israel's retreat last week from southern Lebanon as a complete withdrawal, a United Nations envoy said today, a move that could lessen the possibility of renewed violence along the Israeli-Lebanese border.</p>
        <p>After a meeting in Damascus, the envoy, Terje Roed-Larsen, said he and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara of Syria were in ''full agreement on every matter'' concerning the withdrawal and could decide soon how to deploy more United Nations peacekeeping troops in southern Lebanon.</p>
        <p>Specifically, he said, the Syrians agreed with a United Nations report issued last week that said Israel did not have to give up a contested piece of territory of about 10 square miles at the far southeastern corner of Lebanon -- called Shabaa Farms -- to comply with Security Council Resolution 425.</p>
        <p>That resolution dates from the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and calls for Israel's withdrawal from land it occupied at that time.</p>
        <p>Most of Shabaa Farms was captured by Israel in 1967, after its war with its Arab neighbors, Israel has argued, and is therefore not covered by Resolution 425.</p>
        <p>The announcement from Mr. Roed-Larsen suggests that Syria, which exercises ultimate military and political control over Lebanon, has decided to avoid a potentially costly increase in tensions in the Middle East by not challenging the United Nations over verification of Israel's withdrawal.</p>
        <p>The reaction in Lebanon was confused. The government and the armed Hezbollah militia have threatened to continue attacking Israelis if Shabaa Farms is not returned.</p>
        <p>Lebanon's prime minister, Selim al-Hoss, issued a statement saying he had also talked with Mr. Shara and had been told that Syria supported Lebanon's claim to Shabaa Farms. The official Syrian press agency SANA also reported that Mr. Shara called on Israel to withdraw from Shabaa Farms, either unilaterally or in accordance with other United Nations resolutions related to land it gained in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.</p>
        <p>A Hezbollah spokesman in Beirut said the militia was not ready to comment on the statement by Mr. Roed-Larsen.</p>
        <p>The apparent conflict over whether Syria does or does not back the Lebanese and Hezbollah position is more than a matter of semantics.</p>
        <p>Leaders of Hezbollah, the main guerrilla movement in the south, have said they will not abandon their war until Israel gives up Shabaa Farms, a mountainous stretch of land at the base of Mount Hermon in the Golan Heights, and releases all Lebanese held in Israeli jails.</p>
        <p>The Lebanese government, which has permitted the Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim militia to operate freely in the south and has lauded it as a national liberation force, has echoed the Hezbollah threats.</p>
        <p>But at the same time, the government and Hezbollah are tightly tied to Syria, which has some 30,000 soldiers and an undisclosed number of intelligence agents in Lebanon. So a Syrian decision to accept Israel's withdrawal as full compliance with Resolution 425 would obligate Lebanon and the militia to follow suit.</p>
        <p>As far as the United Nations resolutions are concerned, Shabaa Farms is part of the land Israel seized from Syria along with the Golan Heights. Lebanese officials have said they want all their land restored, regardless of when it was occupied.</p>
        <p>United Nations officials, including Mr. Roed-Larsen, have said recently that the ownership of Shabaa Farms is a matter to be decided between Syria and Lebanon. The two countries have never agreed on an international border between them.</p>
        <p>Shabaa Farms is a rocky, mountainous tract along Lebanon's southeastern border, strategic because it overlooks the Golan Heights and also southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa region along Lebanon's border with Syria. Seven small rivers that feed into the Jordan all converge in a depression of the Shabaa Farms land.</p>
        <p>Before the June 1967 war, the land contained a series of family-owned farms where Lebanese peasants grew wheat and grazed their livestock. But two weeks after the war ended, Shabaa Farms became a new battleground, its farmers driven from their fields and homes by Israeli soldiers seeking a vantage point to watch for incursions by Palestinian militants operating from southern Lebanon.</p>
        <p>Ahmed Ali, now 75, lived through the Israeli invasion. In an interview in his home in Shabaa, a village perched on the hillside just west of the farms, Mr. Ali said he remembered that he and his relatives had been harvesting their summer wheat when Israeli soldiers appeared and sprayed the fields with machine-gun fire.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Ali's cousins was killed. ''Then they made everyone leave their homes and they destroyed them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His nephew, Yehiya Ali, has been collecting deeds and other documents from the displaced owners of land in Shabaa Farms for 15 years -- an effort that so annoyed the Israeli occupation forces in southern Lebanon that they threw him in prison for a week in 1987.</p>
        <p>Yehiya Ali, who moved from Shabaa to Beirut two years after his imprisonment and returned home only last week, has now revived his effort to reclaim his family's land.</p>
        <p>He said some 10,000 Lebanese used to live year-round on the land, including his own extended family, and another 1,000 families farmed plots there but lived in the town of Shabaa.</p>
        <p>''We know this land is ours and it belongs to Lebanon,'' he said today as he spread the documents out on a table in his uncle's home.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 2, 2000, Friday  An article yesterday about a United Nations envoy's statement that Syria is ready to accept Israel's retreat from Lebanon as a complete withdrawal misstated the timing of Security Council Resolution 425, calling for Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon. It was adopted in 1978, after Israeli occupied part of southern Lebanon, not in 1982, after Israel's full-scale invasion of Lebanon.</p>
