        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: RESHAPING POLICE  Tom Constantine, 61, a former New York State police chief and head of the Drug Enforcement Administration until his retirement last year, is to take charge of reshaping Northern Ireland's police. The British government said he would be responsible for overseeing proposed reforms to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the 93-percent Protestant force that is to be renamed the Police Service of Northern Ireland and employ more Catholics.</p>

        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: PAISLEY ROADBLOCK  The hard-line Democratic Unionists of the Rev. Ian Paisley said their party would fill its two seats in the 10-man cabinet of the power-sharing government as long as Sinn Fein, political wing of the Irish Republican Army, was permitted to keep its two seats. The party's deputy head, Peter Robinson, said the arrangement was intended to frustrate the work of the legislature and bring down the peace accord by denying the two seats to any supporters of the agreement.</p>

        <p>CHECHNYA: TOP RUSSIAN KILLED  A senior Russian official, Sergei Zverev, was killed along with the deputy mayor of Grozny, Nusreda Khabuseyeva, when their car struck a mine on the outskirts of the Chechen capital. The blast also hurt Grozny's mayor, Supyan Makhachayev, and Russian officials speculated the attack was an assassination attempt against the city's political leaders, who are cooperating with Russian forces there.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: VISA PLAN APPROVED  Chancellor Gerhard Schroder said his cabinet approved a disputed plan to overcome a shortage of computer experts by offering temporary visas for up to 20,000 specialists from outside the European Union. The Christian Democrats say Germany should concentrate on integrating currentimmigrants rather than letting more come in. The bill will go to the upper house on July 14 and if passed will take effect Aug. 1.</p>

        <p>CANADA: E. COLI TOLL RISES  The death toll from an E. coli outbreak has risen to seven, and autopsies are being conducted on the bodies of two other people who died before the contamination became known on May 21. Dr. Murray Quigge, health official for Waterton, the infected town in Ontario, has charged that Stan Koebel, manager of the town's water company, knew about the contamination on May 18.</p>

        <p>HONG KONG: 'BOAT PEOPLE' CAMP CLOSED  Hong Kong closed its last camp for Vietnamese refugees, ending the 25-year saga of ''boat people'' who fled after the fall of Saigon. The territory announced in February that it would shut the camp, offering local residency to the 1,070 people still inside. By nightfall only 164 holdouts were left. Despite warnings, the authorities seemed willing to give the refugees -- some of whom have been in the camp for more than a decade -- a few more days to find new lodgings.</p>

        <p>JAPAN: WARTIME COMPENSATION  After a long period of neglect, Parliament approved legislation to compensate Korean and Taiwanese veterans wounded while serving in the Imperial Army in World War II. About 3,000 people will receive about $37,500 each, while about $18,750 will be paid to bereaved families. Until now, Japan has denied such claims on the ground they were not citizens of Japan.</p>

        <p>PAKISTAN: FIRM ON TAXES  The military ruler, Pervez Musharraf, told businessmen he would not back away from a plan to raise sales taxes and require tax evaders to pay up despite a continuing strike by shopkeepers in most major markets. Pakistan is deeply in debt and trying to convince international lenders that it is increasing tax collections.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: WOMEN AND THE WALL  A bill that passed Parliament in a preliminary reading would make it illegal for Jewish women to wear prayer shawls, don phylacteries or blow ram's horns at the Western Wall. The bill, which requires three more readings to become law, is intended to bypass a recent High Court ruling that said women should be allowed to pray at the wall just as men do.</p>

        <p>IRAQ: U.N. PANEL RE-ELECTED  Iraq's oil minister said in Baghdad that the government of Saddam Hussein would not deal with a new arms inspection commission being organized at the United Nations. The chief inspector, Hans Blix of Sweden, is about to submit to the Security Council his first report on the start-up of the body, the United Nations Monitoring Verification and Inspection Commission, which is interviewing experts to monitor Iraq. Under council resolutions, sanctions on Iraq cannot be lifted until it cooperates with the panel.</p>

        <p>IRAN: 4 MORE REFORMERS  The conservative election watchdog body, the Council of Guardians, confirmed the victories of four more reformers in the second round of parliamentary voting on May 5, Iranian television said. The elections bring to 202 the number of seats reformers hold in the 290-seat Parliament. The council must still confirm 25 seats.</p>

        <p>ETHIOPIA: WAR'S END DECLARED  Prime Minister Meles Zenawi declared the two-year-old border war with Eritrea at an end, saying Ethiopia had recovered all its territory. But he warned that Ethiopia would take appropriate action if there was any provocation from Eritrea. Ethiopians captured huge swaths of territory in a ground and air offensive begun on May 12 to reclaim lands it says Eritrea occupied at the start of their border war in May 1998.</p>

        <p>SIERRA LEONE: REBELS RETAKE TOWN  Rebels struck back against government forces, recapturing the strategic town of Lunsar two days after it was taken, loyalist fighters and officials said. The recapture was the latest twist in a crisis that began when Revolutionary United Front rebels took hostage hundreds of United Nations peacekeepers. Although the last of the hostages were freed last weekend, 258 peacekeepers remain surrounded in eastern Sierra Leone.</p>

        <p>Correction:  June 2, 2000, Friday  Because of an editing error, a heading in the World Briefing column yesterday referred incorrectly to efforts to form a new United Nations arms inspection commission for Iraq. The Iraqi oil minister rejected the panel, saying his government would not cooperate. The heading should have read, ''U.N. Panel Rejected,'' not ''Re-elected.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 3, 2000, Saturday  Reports in the World Briefing column on Thursday and on May 26 about an outbreak of illness in Ontario caused by E. coli bacteria misstated the name of the town where it occurred. It is Walkerton, not Waterton.</p>
