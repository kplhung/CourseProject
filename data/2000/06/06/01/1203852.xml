        <p>''Anonymous,'' a comedy at the McGinn/Cazale Theater on the Upper West Side, is about an unappreciated and lonely writer who finds happiness in the conventional pleasures of living in a civilized society and pays the price for it. It's a play that tries to make the case for being true to yourself, but its more cogent accomplishment is to ask the question: Why would a man need a good job and a loving woman when he can suffer with his art in obscurity?</p>
        <p>As written by Glen Merzer and directed by Pamela Berlin, this is a play that couldn't be less self-aware. It means to condemn the conventional expectations that society holds for an individual, but it does so with precisely the kind of yuppie presumption it holds in disdain and with characters and dialogue that seem like outtakes from prime-time television. If you can believe it, the pivotal figure in the plot is a Mafia gangster in search of a ghostwriter.</p>

        <p>''Anonymous,'' a comedy at the McGinn/Cazale Theater on the Upper West Side, is about an unappreciated and lonely writer who finds happiness in the conventional pleasures of living in a civilized society and pays the price for it. It's a play that tries to make the case for being true to yourself, but its more cogent accomplishment is to ask the question: Why would a man need a good job and a loving woman when he can suffer with his art in obscurity?</p>
        <p>As written by Glen Merzer and directed by Pamela Berlin, this is a play that couldn't be less self-aware. It means to condemn the conventional expectations that society holds for an individual, but it does so with precisely the kind of yuppie presumption it holds in disdain and with characters and dialogue that seem like outtakes from prime-time television. If you can believe it, the pivotal figure in the plot is a Mafia gangster in search of a ghostwriter.</p>
        <p>The situation is this: Harris Harbison (Chip Zien) is the author of three novels (they're called ''Here and There,'' ''Back and Forth'' and ''To and Fro'') that few read and that are demeaned by his own editor as not being profound. As we first see him, he is so broke and so isolated living in a squalid Manhattan apartment that he has been reduced to reading and rereading the adoring letters of a single fan, a woman from Flaxton, Mo.</p>
        <p>To his ostensible rescue comes his old friend Tim (David Arrow), who gets him a job writing advertising copy and sets him up with Donna, his wife's nutritionist. In the play's two best scenes, neither Donna (Betsy Aidem) on the blind date, nor Harris's potential boss (Kevin O'Rourke) in his job interview, pays the slightest attention to Harris's attempts to turn them off.</p>
        <p>It's sitcom stuff -- characters defying expectations with their quirks -- but it's effectively amusing, and Ms. Aidem and Mr. O'Rourke are engaging actors. Before long Harris is happily employed and sexually active. And we're happy for him; Mr. Zien makes Harris an appealingly foolish grump.</p>
        <p>But the good will that has begun to accrue to the play becomes irrevocably undone with the introduction of Roy Canelli (Peter Appel), the mobster who hires Harris to rewrite his illiterate, bloody novel about -- guess what? -- the mob. Donna puts them together; he's her client.</p>
        <p>''He's very rich, macho but sweet, and low in potassium,'' she explains.</p>
        <p>That as a plot this is idiotic is almost beside the point; that's what suspension of disbelief is for. But in this play, Roy is the device for teaching Harris the lesson that he is, to the exclusion of any other responsibility, an artist. Roy is, of course, not sweet; he's vicious and moronic, but that doesn't seem to bother Harris too much once he gets paid and the book becomes a best seller. Nor does the fact that he himself has become a criminal; these are ill-gotten gains after all.</p>
        <p>No, what finally gets under his skin -- with significant help from his letter-writing muse (Rosemarie DeWitt) -- is the fact that he's not getting any credit for his work. In the end, Harris loses everything -- his job and Donna -- but not his sense that he deserves recognition. Some lesson. Me, me, me.</p>
        <p>This is a strange moral universe, indeed, and it's puzzling that so many accomplished actors (including Elizabeth Franz, a Tony winner for ''Death of a Salesman'' a year ago, who appears on videotape as a talk show host) would go along with it. In this play anyone who makes money is conniving or hypocritical, and decency is quickly and easily undone by mistrust.</p>
        <p>A good man is condemned to suffer and die, a woman who seeks to make a troubled relationship work is dispatched as unworthy, and another woman who travels halfway across the country for a one-night stand (leaving her infant with a neighbor) is a heroine, even after her betrayal of the protagonist ends up emptying his bank account.</p>
        <p>A dedication to art is the only solution to compromise and corruption in this play, which may be the funniest thing about it.</p>
