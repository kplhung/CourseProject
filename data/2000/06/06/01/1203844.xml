        <p>A group of Texan stars finished strongly in the Women's Team Trials in Raleigh, N.C., on Tuesday night, earning the right to represent the United States in the world championships in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in August. Mildred Breed, Shawn Quinn, Petra Hamman, Peggy Sutherlin, Joan Jackson and Robin Klar began the final 16 deals leading by just 1 imp, then surged to win by 42 imps. Breed and Quinn both have world titles, while the other players will be hoping for their first international honors. They will face strong opposition from European teams.</p>
        <p>The losers in Raleigh were an experienced New York squad: Judi Radin, Gail Greenberg, Jacqui Mitchell, Sylvia Moss, Stasha Cohen and Irina Levitina. Radin has long been known for thinking as fast as anyone in the game. The average time she devotes to planning the play when her dummy appears is perhaps five seconds, but on the diagramed deal from a qualifying match it was closer to five minutes.</p>

        <p>A group of Texan stars finished strongly in the Women's Team Trials in Raleigh, N.C., on Tuesday night, earning the right to represent the United States in the world championships in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in August. Mildred Breed, Shawn Quinn, Petra Hamman, Peggy Sutherlin, Joan Jackson and Robin Klar began the final 16 deals leading by just 1 imp, then surged to win by 42 imps. Breed and Quinn both have world titles, while the other players will be hoping for their first international honors. They will face strong opposition from European teams.</p>
        <p>The losers in Raleigh were an experienced New York squad: Judi Radin, Gail Greenberg, Jacqui Mitchell, Sylvia Moss, Stasha Cohen and Irina Levitina. Radin has long been known for thinking as fast as anyone in the game. The average time she devotes to planning the play when her dummy appears is perhaps five seconds, but on the diagramed deal from a qualifying match it was closer to five minutes.</p>
        <p>As South, she landed in four hearts after East had opened three diamonds and West had shown a spade suit. The opening lead was the diamond jack, making a 7-2 split in that suit probable. She had to assume a 3-2 trump split, and a bad division in either black suit would surely be fatal. She therefore played for East to have 2-2-7-2 distribution, and after much thought found a way to succeed in that situation barring double-dummy defense.</p>
        <p>After winning with the diamond ace, she ducked a club. East won and led a trump, taken by the ace. Now, at the right moment, South ruffed a diamond and drew trumps. A club to the ace and another club established dummy's suit. The spade king was the entry, permitting South to discard her remaining diamond on a club winner, making a game that failed in the replay.</p>
        <p>All the obvious defenses were due to fail, but there was a remarkable possibility. The defense would have prevailed if, after winning the second trick, East had shifted to the spade three. West could then have played the jack, forcing the king. This would have removed dummy's entry prematurely and left East with an entry. The effect is similar if West plays a club honor at the second trick and shifts to a low spade if she is allowed to win.</p>
