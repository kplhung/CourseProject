        <p>The federal government and many of the nation's leading telephone companies agreed today to a reshuffling of phone rates that would reduce the bills of tens of millions of less-affluent consumers.</p>
        <p>The reductions, described by officials of the Federal Communications Commission as the largest rate cut in the history of federal telephone regulation, should lead to less-significant cuts for other consumers and businesses. And the changes could ultimately lead to a flat rate for long-distance service, much like fees paid by mobile phone users.</p>
        <p>Government officials said they had a commitment from the long-distance companies to pass on to consumers the benefits of $3.2 billion in savings from a reduction in the payments they make to local telephone companies to connect calls to customers, known as access charges.</p>
        <p>Officials said the cuts would have the biggest effect on the poor and those who use their phones the least. Rates would be reduced as much as 50 percent -- to $4.68 from $9.39 a month in a typical case -- for Americans who make few or no long-distance calls.</p>
        <p>For consumers and businesses that make more long-distance calls, the government predicted reduced costs, though some consumer groups and Wall Street analysts disagreed with the government's estimates, suggesting they were too rosy.</p>
        <p>The consumer groups and analysts questioned whether the significant savings recognized by the long-distance companies would ultimately be passed on to consumers. They also said that the government could not force the companies to pass the savings on to the consumers, who would have to rely on the good faith of the long-distance companies.</p>
        <p>But officials said that when access charges were last reduced three years ago, the long-distance companies began engaging in a price war that drastically lowered overall phone rates.</p>
        <p>The critics and analysts said, however, that long-distance companies had been slow to pass on all of the savings when the access charges were cut and that the benefit to consumers from the price wars was offset by new fees tacked on to their bills.</p>
        <p>Critics and officials agreed that today's action would fundamentally reshape the economics of the telephone industry and that it was another big step toward deregulation. It is also part of an evolution toward a price structure in which long-distance rates will ultimately be like wireless and Internet service rates -- either a flat monthly fee or a fee that entitles the customer to a bundle of minutes.</p>
        <p>''Today's announcement is a giant step forward in rationalizing pricing,'' said William E. Kennard, the chairman of the F.C.C. ''This is the most dramatic reduction in telephone service prices in the history of this agency.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennard said the price changes would take effect in July. He said the commission's action was an effort to accelerate competition by ending several implicit subsidies.</p>
        <p>Today's moves involved an agreement and an order by the F.C.C. They were the products of more than a year of intense negotiations among local and long-distance companies and federal regulators on issues that have divided the local and long-distance providers from the moment they were created with the breakup of AT&amp;T 16 years ago.</p>
        <p>Telephone executives from most of the nation's top companies applauded the order.</p>
        <p>''When the results of today's action start showing up on customer bills in a month or so, consumers will see that the total cost of local and long-distance telephone service will be down,'' said Duane Ackerman, the chairman and chief executive of BellSouth.</p>
        <p>''At the same time,'' he said, ''those customers who live in rural areas that are expensive to serve and those people who need help paying their phone bills will be ensured affordable service well into the future.''</p>
        <p>Officials said that the companies had ultimately reached an agreement with one another and regulators because of several important trends, including the blurring of the lines between local and long-distance companies, the competitive threats posed by the emergence of telephone service on the Internet and the heavy pressure put on regulators by a Republican Congress to reduce regulations and let the marketplace play a greater role in setting prices.</p>
        <p>As part of the agreement, AT&amp;T said it would eliminate the $3 minimum monthly fee that it charges to millions of customers who make few or no long-distance calls.</p>
        <p>Combined with other changes announced today, a typical monthly bill for an AT&amp;T customer who makes no long-distance calls would be cut in half. For a customer who made 10 minutes of long-distance calls, total monthly charges would decrease 27 percent, to $6.87 from $9.39.</p>
        <p>The order simplifies telephone bills by folding two separate charges -- one for the cost of telephone lines and the other a special access charge -- into one. It reduces an earlier announced rate increase for the combined items by 66 cents a month.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece of the agreement, spelled out in the summary of the  order that will soon be issued by the commission, reduces by $3.2 billion the access charges that long-distance companies like AT&amp;T and Sprint pay to local telephone companies like Bell Atlantic to use their lines at the beginning and end of a call. The reduction amounts to a cut of about 25 percent in access fees paid to the local companies.</p>
        <p>Commission officials said they could not precisely quantify the reduction for heavy users of long-distance services, and some analysts and consumer groups said they doubted that many of the savings would result in significantly lower bills.</p>
        <p>''We hope that the F.C.C. will monitor this process to ensure that the $3.2 billion in long-distance company savings are translated into demonstrable price reductions for consumers,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union.</p>
        <p>''Today's decision is a clear benefit for people who make few or no long-distance calls,'' he said. ''But it still leaves consumers paying inflated monthly charges.''</p>
        <p>Scott C. Cleland, a telecommunications analyst at the Legg Mason Precursor Group, said that experience had shown that the companies had not passed on savings from reductions in access charges.</p>
        <p>''The companies have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders to not necessarily pass them on,'' Mr. Cleland said. ''To the extent that prices don't fall, these savings increase long-distance profits. The companies may pass them on, but it will be over time.''</p>
        <p>Industry executives said the decision was part of a trend that will lead to long-distance fees' resembling the fees charged by Internet companies and cell phone providers.</p>
        <p>''The pricing structure that these rules permit allows us to move more in the direction that will ultimately lead to Internet pricing or wireless pricing in the long-distance market,'' said John Nakahata, a former top official at the F.C.C. and spokesman for the coalition of telephone companies that signed the agreement.</p>
        <p>As a result of the fee changes, local telephone companies stand to get a short-term shortfall of as much as $500 million over the next year. But industry executives and analysts said that lower prices should increase demand more than enough to offset the shortfall.</p>
        <p>''This industry is growing at a rapid rate, and we're all realizing significant cost reductions,'' said Frank Gumper, vice president for regulatory and long-range planning at Bell Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Traders on Wall Street shrugged off the announcement of the rate changes. There was no uniform movement in the stock prices of telephone companies, and changes were modest.</p>
        <p>In a partial dissent to today's order, a commissioner accused the F.C.C. staff of making improper side deals with the telephone industry to gain its support for the order.</p>
        <p>The commissioner, Harold Furchtgott-Roth, said that in exchange for the industry's support, the staff had agreed to waive certain onerous depreciation rules and rule favorably in a separate access fee proceeding. Both proceedings involve billions of dollars for the companies.</p>
        <p>''To be clear, I do not believe that any employee of this agency acted in bad faith'' Mr. Furchtgott-Roth wrote. ''But I cannot escape the conclusion that the process by which this notice has been promulgated falls short of certain fundamental principles that govern the behavior of administrative agencies.''</p>
        <p>Both industry lobbyists and staff officials denied that any separate deals had been reached.</p>
