        <p>Letter by Elizabeth C Gorski responds to May 25 article on cyberspace news; says article failed to mention the decades-long interactive feature of print newspapers: crossword puzzle</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a crossword puzzle maker (including some for the daily and Sunday New York Times), I'd like to point out that the May 25 article about online newspapers did not mention a decades-long interactive feature of print newspapers: the crossword puzzle. No other part of the newspaper invites the reader to  interact with the page.</p>
        <p>Though I'm able to download The New York Times puzzle and solve it offline, I wouldn't dream of it. Each morning I buy the newspaper and turn to the puzzle page. I need that tactile interaction with the printed page to get my brain going. I have a high-risk tolerance, so I use ink. The handwritten letters indicate whether my solving journey was smooth (neat, with no cross-outs) or awful (in which the case the grid is gooped-up enough to be re-used as a Rorschach test). The computer screen leaves no such evidence. It's too clinical for real puzzle solving.</p>

        <p>Upon finishing the puzzle in the morning, I'm convinced that I've accomplished something. Illusion or not, I'm on a roll. I then turn on my  computer and begin my workday -- and that may include making a puzzle or two.</p>
