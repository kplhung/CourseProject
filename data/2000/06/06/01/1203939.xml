        <p>When Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel meets President Clinton in Lisbon today, he will report his expectation of a deal with Yasir Arafat that can be signed on the White House lawn in time to affect the U.S. elections. It is a great political gift and a greater security gamble.</p>
        <p>Key to the establishment of a Palestinian state in almost the entire West Bank is Barak's startling decision that the Jordan Valley is no longer needed for Israel's defense.</p>
        <p>Even in Labor's dovish ''Allon plan'' of generations ago, that buffer behind the West Bank of the Jordan River was considered essential to slow an Arab attack. But Barak, along with another former army chief of staff, just made a military decision that changed today's negotiating equation.</p>
        <p>In the new military thinking, it would be unwise to continue to station Israeli forces in the valley between the Kingdom of Jordan and the new state of Palestine. If those two states were in alliance, goes the convenient analysis, Israeli troops would be in a crossfire. If those two states came into conflict, then Israel would be in the middle, unwillingly involved.</p>
        <p>Nobody likes to admit this, but Israel's abandonment of the historic valley presages the end of minority Hashemite rule in Jordan. The new king is pleading with Barak to retain at least a sliver of territory along the river to shield his regime from Palestinians bent on avenging their bloody defeat in ''Black September'' of 1970; they still want a trans-Jordanian ''Greater Palestine.'' ''With a common border,'' says Ariel Sharon, leader of Israel's opposition, ''the end of the existence of the Hashemite Kingdom is only a matter of time.''</p>
        <p>Barak's military reassessment clears the way for the kind of pre-emptive territorial concession Arafat cannot refuse. For years, realistic deal makers have been talking about a final settlement that would give the Palestinians two-thirds of the West Bank, with Israeli settlements not close to Jerusalem or Tel Aviv in security zones. The addition of the Jordan Valley means that some 93 percent would go to the new Palestinian state.</p>
        <p>However, casualty-weary Israel's badly organized retreat from its buffer zone in Lebanon, betraying longtime local allies, has whetted Palestinian appetites: if Hezbollah can force the Jews out of ''every inch,'' why can't we?</p>
        <p>''I hear that Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem,'' says the Likud's Sharon, ''will get a Zone B status, with municipal administration by the new Palestinian entity. That means the division of Jerusalem.'' He calls the overlapping jurisdiction and befuzzing of sovereignty -- a sure source of future friction -- ''foolish and irresponsible.''</p>
        <p>Barak and Arafat will call it peace. In his farewell October surprise, with his wife campaigning at his side, Clinton will confidently give America's promise to underwrite the cost.</p>
        <p>Barak has also promised Israelis a referendum on both this deal and his giveback of the Golan Heights to Syria. He will argue that such a Lesser Israel is not necessarily weaker; on the contrary, that a time of peace in the region will let Israel strengthen its alliances with the U.S., the Europeans (already offering inducements in the U.N.) and the technology-hungry Chinese.</p>
        <p>The political presumption is that if he can set the rules for a referendum to require only a majority of those voting, Barak's sweeping concessions are likely to prevail. Diplomatic cheering, economic incentives and global media enthusiasm provide momentum; the despair of Israel's battle-fatigued and the hopefulness of its forgetful add to the campaign against caution.</p>
        <p>Is acceding to a Lesser Israel a dangerous gamble? Yes. Are these leaks about the extent of Israel's concessions intended to shock so they can be reduced? Probably. Should Israel seek evidence of Arab trustworthiness before rolling its security dice? Definitely.</p>
        <p>People with views like mine call themselves shtarkers. That's based on the German word for ''strong,'' with a self-mocking Yiddish connotation of ''hard-line, insufferably resolute.'' Israel started out as the land of shtarkers. Maybe that's changed.</p>
