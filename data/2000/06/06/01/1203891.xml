        <p>Russia's lower house of Parliament ignored misgivings by political analysts and democracy advocates today and resoundingly endorsed a first draft of President Vladimir V. Putin's plan to concentrate state power in the Kremlin.</p>
        <p>The wave of support strongly suggests that Russia's upper house of Parliament, the Federation Council -- which stands to lose much of its power to the Kremlin should the plan pass -- will be more or less helpless to do anything about it.</p>
        <p>The lower house, or Duma, passed the first reading of Mr. Putin's three-law proposal by a vote of 362 to 34.</p>
        <p>Nikolai Petrov, an expert on Russian regional political structure at the Moscow Center of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said tonight that the vote showed that Mr. Putin had control of Parliament firmly in his hands.</p>
        <p>''His calculation was rather correct, and the Duma is clearly backing the president in this,'' he said. ''It means it's very easy for him to deal with the Federation Council.''</p>
        <p>Two more readings will occur in late June before the bills reach a final vote, and once amendments are offered, the support for the plan might split. But as long as the Kremlin keeps 300 votes in the Duma, it can override any changes that the Federation Council might attempt.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's proposals take dead aim at the governors who lead Russia's 89 regions, a group that gained considerable independence under President Boris N. Yeltsin and represents the major challenge these days to Kremlin authority.</p>
        <p>His legislation would remove the governors from their guaranteed seats on the Federation Council, where they hold 50 percent of the vote, and would also remove the local legislative leaders -- often the governors' allies -- who hold the remaining seats. They would be replaced by senators chosen by local legislatures in a secret ballot.</p>
        <p>Today in the regional capital of Yaroslavl, Mr. Putin went a step further, suggesting that a region's representation in the Federation Council should be proportional to its contribution to the federal till. Currently the council is composed of two representatives from each region.</p>
        <p>In his proposal to Parliament, Mr. Putin also seeks the authority to remove governors if they pursue policies counter to federal law, and to name a replacement of his own choosing. Some of these firings would require a court hearing.</p>
        <p>Among other initiatives, the proposed laws would give governors and regional legislatures the power to fire local officials who violate laws -- but would give the president the right to name replacements until new elections can be held.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin has made restoring central authority a centerpiece of his new presidency, and almost everyone here agrees -- in principle -- that the Kremlin grip on the levers of federalism is too weak. But many are just as adamant that the latest plan moves much too far toward making Mr. Putin or any successor not a democratic president, but a Latin American style strongman.</p>
        <p>The Kremlin's plans are politically potent not just because they would dilute the governors' influence in Moscow but also because they would give Mr. Putin powerful weapons to use against them. If the threat of removal from office is not enough, the governors would also lose the current immunity from criminal prosecution should they lose their legislative seats.</p>
