        <p>Murray Sabrin is waving a maroon-bound pocket-size version of the United States Constitution to make a point.</p>
        <p>''This is our contract with the people,'' he said. ''This is my agenda, if you will, to restore the principles here, to put a fire wall around the Bill of Rights.''</p>
        <p>Try as he might, Mr. Sabrin still sounds like a Libertarian, even though he is running for the United States Senate as a Republican.</p>
        <p>He wants to eliminate the federal income tax, and while other politicians decry urban sprawl, he sees no problem with it. He has had it with demands for political correctness and affirmative action and gun control.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sabrin, 53, ran for governor three years ago on the Libertarian Party ticket, raised enough in contributions to qualify for public funds, and picked up more than 100,000 votes, something that no other third-party candidate for statewide office in New Jersey had ever done. He still came in a distant third, but not before worrying Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who won a narrow re-election victory, that he was taking away some of her more conservative constituents.</p>
        <p>And now he is back, in a new incarnation as a Republican, but sounding very much like the old Murray Sabrin.</p>
        <p>''The theme of this campaign is that we want to end political correctness,'' he said recently. ''The government shouldn't be establishing or mandating preference programs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sabrin, a professor of finance at Ramapo College in Mahwah, may have changed parties, but he is clearly still the odd man out in this race, a crowded one with four candidates vying in Tuesday's primary. The other Republicans are State Senator William Gormley, United States Representative Robert D. Franks and the Essex County executive, James W. Treffinger.</p>
        <p>If the outcome is determined in part on ties to party leaders, it is clear that this will be a party to which Mr. Sabrin was not invited.</p>
        <p>''I don't consider Murray Sabrin a Republican,'' said Chuck Haytaian, the chairman of the state Republican Party, practically sputtering.</p>
        <p>''I think he's a Libertarian with some very outlandish views. He should not be running in this primary,'' Mr. Haytaian said.</p>
        <p>But party rules say anyone who gathers 1,000 names on a petition can run in a primary, and Mr. Sabrin did just that.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sabrin may have won 114,000 votes in the 1997 election for governor, but that was less than 5 percent of the total, said Tom Wilson, Mrs. Whitman's campaign manager then. Mr. Wilson said Mr. Sabrin remained a fringe candidate with no real chance of winning the nomination.</p>
        <p>''New Jersey Republicans are, for the most part, open-minded, inclusive, progressive, mainstream, middle-of-the-road, moderate type Republicans,'' he said. ''Will he get some votes? Of course he will. There are people who choose to use their vote to send a message to the establishment or whoever that they don't like the status quo.''</p>
        <p>So far, Mr. Sabrin has raised $328,000, but that is small compared with what his opponents have raised. One of them, Mr. Gormley, has raised $2.4 million. Mr. Wilson said that was another strong indicator of the limited support for Mr. Sabrin.</p>
        <p>''Murray Sabrin is the Lyndon LaRouche of New Jersey,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''He can put his name on the ballot any time he wants, but he's making a joke of the whole electoral process.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sabrin says the Republican Party needs the kind of agenda he is offering. ''Last time around, the Republican candidate didn't get that marginal voter that's going to elect a Republican in the state, the pro-lifers and the Second Amendment voters,'' he said. ''That's who will vote for me.''</p>
        <p>His supporters tend to sound a lot like he does.</p>
        <p>''He's developed a following of people like me who are just fed up to their ears with what's going on in Washington,'' said Frank Reick, an inventor and businessman in Washington Township who, along with his wife has donated about $15,000 to Mr. Sabrin's campaigns since 1997. ''I'm a firm believer in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and so is Murray.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sabrin has been endorsed in this race by New Jersey Right to Life  and by the Association of Rifle and Pistol Clubs. He wants to legislatively overturn the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, and is very much against any gun controls.  But he is not, he insists, anti-government. If he must be reduced to a label, he said he was for limited government.</p>
        <p>''If I were truly anti-government, I would be in the hills somewhere opting out, and I'm not,'' he said recently, sitting in his campaign office in a shopping mall here, an American flag behind him, and an autographed photograph of Rush Limbaugh in front of him on his desk. ''I am the only candidate who has true conservative grass-roots support. ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sabrin was born in Germany to parents who were the only ones in their family to survive the Holocaust. He grew up in the Bronx and attended the Bronx High School of Science and Hunter College. His first job was as a teacher in New York City.</p>
        <p>He went on to get his Ph.D. in economic geography from Rutgers University, and worked as an analyst and economist. He has taught at Ramapo College since 1985.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sabrin bristles at criticism that while he calls for limited government and low taxes and no social safety net, he has benefited from attending a tuition-free college, and he works for a public college.</p>
        <p>''To criticize me is extremely mean-spirited,'' he said. ''I went to college before I had read anything about Libertarian ideas. It was an opportunity that was available.'' The public college he teaches at, Mr. Sabrin adds, raises a significant part of its budget from tuition.</p>
        <p>He also said he was not surprised that many of his opponents were criticizing his change of parties after he lost as a Libertarian. He is merely returning to the party he belonged to in his youth, he said.</p>
        <p>''I joined the Republican Party in 1969 with the views of freedom and individual liberties and free enterprise and an adequate national defense,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Those were my core beliefs then, and they haven't wavered one bit. I was a Republican long before I even heard the term Libertarian.''</p>
        <p>He is stung that he is sometimes the only one of the four candidates not invited to take part in some of the debates or forums that have been held throughout the state. And he knows the Republican Party leaders would rather he not be running under their banner.</p>
        <p>''This is part of the process of the people in the Republican establishment wanting to make sure that the Republican Party is not much different than the Democratic Party,'' he said.</p>
