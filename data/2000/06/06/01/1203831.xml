        <p>DON DAMICO, vice president and general manager of an industrial holding company in New York, visits three of his company's offices, in New York City and Pennsylvania, during the week. Even though he carries a cellular phone, it can be difficult to get in touch with him. Sometimes he turns off his phone for meetings, and he can find it hard to get cell phone coverage in some places.</p>
        <p>''I always have salespeople trying to find me,'' Mr. Damico said. ''With all the travel I do, it's tough to get me in one place.''</p>
        <p>A friend suggested that he try Message point, a service that handles voice, e-mail and fax messages. He signed up with the service for $19.95 per month and was instantly hooked.</p>
        <p>Messagepoint, like other unified messaging services, gives users like Mr. Damico individual telephone numbers they can call to check their messages -- all their messages. Since calls to Mr. Damico's other telephone lines are forwarded to his Messagepoint number if he does not answer them, he has to check only one number for voice mail. All of his e-mail and faxes also go to the same Messagepoint mailbox, and he can check them when he checks his voice mail.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Damico cannot use the phone to find out what is in his faxes, he is  notified when faxes are waiting for him. He can then log on to the Internet to view them at a Web site. E-mail is read to him over the phone, and he can dictate e-mail replies. That saves him hours every month, he said.</p>
        <p>''If one of my guys has an important question for me,'' he said, ''they can send me an e-mail and I can respond to it right away, even if I don't have my laptop.''</p>
        <p>Unified messaging services have been available for more than six years, said Megan Gurley, a research analyst at the Yankee Group, a research firm based in Boston, but they did not catch on until recently because there was not a real need for them. And consumers did not understand what the services could do.</p>
        <p>But as more people try to keep up with home-based, office-based and cellular phones, as well as with multiple e-mail addresses, unified messaging may be on the verge of becoming a mass market product. Demand for the service has also been fueled by technological improvements in voice recognition systems.</p>
        <p>In addition to Messagepoint, companies like General Magic, Onebox.com, Ptek Systems and Webley Systems offer unified messaging, and each has its own take on the service. Some let users dial a local number to retrieve messages, while some offer the option, for an additional fee, of a toll-free number. Some services, like Onebox.com, are free; Onebox. com plans to make money by licensing its technology to telephone companies and cellular carriers. Others, like the Portico service from General Magic, cost $9.95 per month or more and offer news and stock quotations over the phone in addition to message services.</p>
        <p>Once unified messaging services catch on, free services may become hard to find.  For example, Telebot.com, a free service of Portelco, based in Hayward, Calif., recently closed. Nader Rahimizad, the company's chairman and chief executive officer, said Telebot.com would reopen soon as a service designed for cellular carriers.</p>
        <p>All the services let users listen over the phone to their e-mail; the text is ''spoken'' by text-to-speech software. If a user wants to reply to an e-mail note, that person can dictate a response; the service will send an e-mail reply that contains an audio file attachment with the dictated message. Anyone who gets one of these replies can listen to the message by double-clicking on the attachment. Since most PC's today come with the Windows Media Player, which handles WAV files, recipients do not need any additional software to play the messages.</p>
        <p>Message services let people like Mr. Damico roam without a laptop computer and still remain connected to the office.</p>
        <p>''I was traveling once and there was a decision that had to be made on whether we could meet a certain quote for a very large piece of business,'' Mr. Damico said. ''The client e-mailed me. I was able to get his message and listen to it, which I wouldn't have until later that night. I was able to work out a deal with him, and I never saw the e-mail.''</p>
        <p>Some services, like Webley from Webley Systems, Orchestrate from Ptek and Portico, have a ''find me, follow me'' feature that bounces an incoming call from one of the user's phone numbers to the next until the user is located. Even if the user is found in this way, the user can still choose to screen the calls and send to voice mail.</p>
        <p>If a user listens to an e-mail or a voice mail message and wants to respond, there are several services that can handle outbound calls. Webley, for example, lets users dial by name or number and connects the calls at a flat rate of 14.9 cents per minute (expected to drop soon to less than 10 cents). Depending on the service, the fee for outbound calls is in addition to what users pay for calling the messaging center.</p>
        <p>Unified messaging can eliminate the need for a fax machine. Senders can dial a phone number provided by the service to send a fax to one of the service's customers. That fax is then stored as an image file on the Web. Customers can use their computers to view and print their faxes directly from the Web site. That feature proved valuable to Jan Weiss, a vice president at a large commercial bank in Chicago.</p>
        <p>Ms. Weiss was in Washington on business when she ran into a small problem. She was waiting for a fax from her office, but the business center in the hotel she was staying in had already closed. Using Onebox.com's  service, she was able to receive her fax  when she needed it.</p>
        <p>''The documents I needed were for a conference call,'' Ms. Weiss said. ''A client wanted an answer on something. I wouldn't have been able to give them the answer if I didn't get that fax.''</p>
        <p>To sign up for a messaging service, users usually fill out an online form and choose a toll-free telephone number. Generally, the telephone numbers are available for use within minutes.</p>
        <p>The process will become even simpler in the next 6 to 18 months as local telephone companies and cellular carriers start offering versions of unified messaging, Ms. Gurley said. Instead of having customers go through the sign-up process manually, the carriers will do all of the setup. Pacific Bell already offers its customers the Wildfire service from Wildfire Communications, while Bell Atlantic is also working on a unified messaging system.</p>
        <p>Even with the many benefits, there are several problems with unified messaging services. For one thing, a user generally cannot transfer a home or office number to a message service, so dialing the service means another number to remember. Only customers who sign up for a messaging service through a telephone or cellular carrier can make their regular phone numbers their message numbers (although many services let users have calls forwarded from their regular numbers to their message services). And users may have to give out one more number to business associates if they want things sent via fax to services when they are out of their offices.</p>
        <p>In addition, none of the companies offer local telephone numbers for customers to use to call the message center directly in all areas of the country. So unless users are willing to take on the added expense of having services provide them with toll-free numbers, they may end up incurring long-distance charges.</p>
        <p>Users say the extra trouble is worth the result: simplified communications.</p>
        <p>''This is definitely bringing things together for me,'' said Meg Luttrell, a Onebox customer in Palo Alto, Calif. ''Right now we're transitioning offices, and I'm moving in my personal life. Having one number to check is a godsend.''</p>
