        <p>Barring a sudden change of heart, President Vladimir Putin of Russia will do the United States a great service when he sits down with President Clinton this weekend and refuses to modify the Antiballistic Missile Treaty to allow the United States to deploy a limited missile defense.</p>
        <p>Why does Russian opposition work in America's interest? We are still in the early stages of a serious debate over a national defense against missile attacks and, more broadly, over our nuclear strategy in the new century. Without a consensus on these important points, it is simply wrong to cut a deal with Moscow, either now or in the remaining months of the Clinton presidency.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration, of course, does not see it that way. Mr. Clinton does not want to be the first president in decades to fail to sign a significant arms control agreement with the Russians. When the summit meeting was announced several weeks ago, officials hoped to make an arms-control agreement its centerpiece, and saw reasons for optimism.</p>
        <p>In April, Mr. Putin pushed the long-delayed ratification of the second strategic arms reduction treaty, known as Start II, through the Russian Parliament. The Clinton administration took this as a sign that he was prepared to deal. American officials were also encouraged that Sergei Ivanov, director of Russia's national security council and a close Putin confidant, had not flatly opposed amending the ABM treaty, which bans missile defense systems, during a visit to Washington in February.</p>
        <p>Subsequent discussions, however, have shattered the administration's optimism, and it has since tried to lower expectations. Last week, Samuel Berger, the White House national security adviser, stated that he did not expect arms control issues to be resolved this weekend. Rather, he said, the summit would be ''a good opportunity for us to explain our view of the problem, and for President Putin to express his view of the problem.''</p>
        <p>The administration still hopes to cut a deal before Mr. Clinton leaves office, but that remains wishful thinking. The Russians have little incentive to negotiate. The debate in the United States over the reliability of the missile-defense technology and the scope of the system we should build is growing. Our European allies are becoming more concerned, and China is adamantly opposed to missile defense systems. This only encourages Mr. Putin to stand his ground.</p>
        <p>The Russians are also concerned that an American missile defense could eventually undermine the effectiveness of their own nuclear arsenal, arguably their last remaining claim to great power status. The problem is not the limited system the Clinton administration wants to deploy against the threat of missile attacks from North Korea.</p>
        <p>The Russians know that the White House's proposed system would pose no defense against their arsenal. But over the next decade, as the technology improves, they fear that without the ABM treaty's controls, a more effective system could be built.</p>
        <p>Also worrying the Russians are the economic constraints that will force them to reduce their nuclear arsenal, as weapons can no be longer be maintained or replaced, to below 1,500 warheads, regardless of what the United States does. The last thing they can afford is a new high-tech arms race.</p>
        <p>To overcome Moscow's resistance, the Clinton administration could be tempted to sweeten the pot further in its last months by promising to reduce the capabilities of a national defense system. That would be the wrong approach at this time.</p>
        <p>As Gov. George W. Bush and others have noted, there is a new world out there: the nuclear equation has changed radically. The challenge has expanded beyond maintaining  stability between two nuclear-armed superpowers. Arsenals in Russia and the United States may be reduced, but others, notably in China, will increase. Nuclear-weapons and ballistic-missile technology will almost inevitably continue to spread to rogue states.</p>
        <p>While it would be folly to lightly  discard the strategic arms treaties  that have maintained stability for the last 30 years, it would be equal folly not to reassess these treaties in light of the changes over the past decade. In this environment, we do not need a quick decision on whether to deploy a national missile defense system. Instead, we need to forge a domestic consensus about anything we might build, and we must persuade our allies in Europe and East Asia to endorse whatever path we choose.</p>
        <p>Yes, we should be talking all along to the Russians to assess their views and reactions. But until we have done our work at home and with our allies, we should be wary of signing any treaty  with Moscow.</p>
        <p>Logically, only the next administration can conclude this debate. And that is why, if events unfold as expected, Americans should be prepared to thank Vladimir Putin for looking out for their interests by saying no to President Clinton on missile defense.</p>
