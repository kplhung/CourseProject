        <p>The Kaye Playhouse is devoting its annual 20th Century Masters series to Aaron Copland, a natural choice in his centenary year. In some ways, the series is more expansive than usual. Where past installments (Shostakovich, Faure and Barber have been the earlier honorees) have been concentrated at the end of the season, the Copland series continues into the fall, with a concert version of ''The Tender Land'' promised for September.</p>
        <p>Programmatically, though, the series is also more diffuse than those of past years. An orchestral concert on May 24 was all-Copland, but the composer was the focus of only the second half of the program by the Pearl Lang Dance Theater, which opened the series last week. And a concert by the New York Festival of Song on Tuesday evening, called ''Aaron Copland and His Circle,'' also included works by Nadia Boulanger, Paul Bowles, Marc Blitzstein, Leonard Bernstein, Benjamin Britten and Ned Rorem. Copland was, at least, the majority shareholder: 11 of the 20 songs on the program were his.</p>

        <p>The Kaye Playhouse is devoting its annual 20th Century Masters series to Aaron Copland, a natural choice in his centenary year. In some ways, the series is more expansive than usual. Where past installments (Shostakovich, Faure and Barber have been the earlier honorees) have been concentrated at the end of the season, the Copland series continues into the fall, with a concert version of ''The Tender Land'' promised for September.</p>
        <p>Programmatically, though, the series is also more diffuse than those of past years. An orchestral concert on May 24 was all-Copland, but the composer was the focus of only the second half of the program by the Pearl Lang Dance Theater, which opened the series last week. And a concert by the New York Festival of Song on Tuesday evening, called ''Aaron Copland and His Circle,'' also included works by Nadia Boulanger, Paul Bowles, Marc Blitzstein, Leonard Bernstein, Benjamin Britten and Ned Rorem. Copland was, at least, the majority shareholder: 11 of the 20 songs on the program were his.</p>
        <p>There was both a conceptual and a practical rationale for this patchwork. In practical terms, Copland's vocal music -- his Emily Dickinson settings, the folk songs and excerpts from his operas -- is barely enough to sustain a song recital. The other composers here, from Copland's teacher, Boulanger, to his sometime student, Bowles, and a handful of close colleagues, created a framework for the biographical commentary provided between songs by Michael Barrett, the pianist and a director of the Festival of Song.</p>
        <p>There were few surprises in the music itself. Two Boulanger songs, ''Le Couteau'' and ''Chanson,'' had an inviting assertiveness, and the songs by Bowles (''A Little Close, Please'' and ''Lonesome Man''), Blitzstein (''The Rose Song'' from ''Reuben Reuben'') and Bernstein (''The Winner'' from ''Trouble in Tahiti'') touched on the passion for both jazz and theater music that American composers shared. Britten's English folk song settings (''The Trees They Grow So High'' and ''O Waly, Waly'') had natural counterparts in Copland's songs from rural America.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett collaborated with two superb singers, Monique McDonald, a soprano, and Scott Hendricks, a baritone. Each produced a powerful, warm-hued sound that melted easily into subtlety and gentleness when that was required, as in Mr. Rorem's beautiful ''What if Some Little Pain,'' sung by Ms. McDonald, and Mr. Hendricks's account of Copland's ''All the Little Horses.'' But they were at their best in the most passionate music. Mr. Hendricks's reading of ''Zion's Walls'' and Ms. McDonald's performance of ''At the River,'' both Copland songs, were electrifying.</p>
