        <p>The decision came after a six-week review that had been narrowed to Thompson and two other agencies in New York: BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, and Bates Worldwide, part of the Cordiant Communications Group.</p>

        <p>The worldwide assignment is a new one for KPMG, which had used Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide in New York, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, as its agency since 1997. Lowe Lintas resigned the American account earlier this month by withdrawing from the review for the worldwide assignment.</p>
