        <p>SUSSMAN-Roslyn. We extend our sincerest condolences to Marvin Sussman and Judy Sokolow on the passing of their beloved mother. Throughout her life, Roslyn exemplified the values of kindness, modesty and dignity, and was a true ''woman of valor.'' Silver Founders of the Medical Center, Marvin and his wife, Aviva, personify the values of tzedakah and chesed, which they learned from this special woman. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Amer. Comm. For Shaare Zedek Jerusalem Med. Ctr. Erica Jesselson, Chair Menno Ratzker, Pres. Sidney Adler, Treas. Lee Weinbach, Pres., Nat'l Women's Div. Stuart Tauber, Exec. Dir.</p>
