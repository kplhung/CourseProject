        <p>Negotiations to end an impasse between Gov. George Pataki and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman that has blocked major new projects by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey are nearing a successful conclusion, associates of both officials said today.</p>
        <p>Charles Gargano, New York's chief negotiator and the vice chairman of the agency, would not discuss details of the talks, but said, ''We are at the point of submitting something to the two governors.''</p>
        <p>Lewis Eisenberg, chairman of the Port Authority board and New Jersey's chief negotiator, would say only that ''we are close to a comprehensive agreement.'' While none of the negotiators for the two states would confirm that a final agreement was set, many who have been close to the efforts to end the 18-month logjam said in private that the final details were being worked out, paving the way for a long-sought meeting between the two governors. That largely symbolic meeting would be followed within days by a board meeting to ratify the accord.</p>
        <p>At stake in the long dispute is the fate of a proposed 30-year lease to Maersk-Sealand, a major container cargo company at the Elizabeth Marine Terminal, that New Jersey insists is necessary for the port to remain competitive with other East Coast ports.</p>
        <p>New York representatives on the Port Authority board, charging that the deal would amount to a deep subsidy for New Jersey, have refused to approve it, and New Jersey representatives have retaliated by refusing to approve two projects New York covets: privatization of the World Trade Center and the leasing of air rights over Manhattan's Port Authority Bus Terminal.</p>
        <p>But all of those projects would get a go-ahead, said officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity, if the details of the emerging agreement were approved.</p>
        <p>Six elements of that evolving agreement would appear to provide something for everyone. In an effort to assuage New York's concerns that New Jersey disproportionately benefits from agency spending, a $250 million pool of money, or ''development bank,'' would be set aside for New York to spend on port- and transportation-related items over the next three years.</p>
        <p>New Jersey would also agree to let the Port Authority lease space in, and thus help finance, the transportation and office center proposed for Manhattan's main post office building. In addition, New Jersey would end its opposition to a study of an increase in the $1 PATH fare, which New York has long considered to be unfairly subsidized by the Port Authority. Sources in both states conceded that this was likely to mean a fare increase by year's end.</p>
        <p>They said the Port Authority would also invest development funds in South Jamaica, where a new terminal is planned to connect subway and commuter trains to a Kennedy International Airport rail link.</p>
        <p>The deal being hammered out  would provide New Jersey with the $120 million it had planned to spend to dredge major port channels, and with other concessions in the much-disputed valuation of the Maersk-Sealand lease. And it would require that guidelines be set to distinguish subsidies from investments in the region's transportation and commercial infrastructure -- a clarification that both governors have sought.</p>
        <p>Kayla Bergeron, a spokesman for the agency, said it would have no comment on the ongoing talks.</p>
        <p>The reports of a possible settlement come just a week after the agency's monthly board meeting, in which commissioners unanimously approved a $3.9 billion budget for this year in what Mr. Eisenberg and Mr. Gargano conceded was a sign of progress in the effort to end the impasse.</p>
        <p>At the previous month's meeting the board failed to even vote on the budget, a sign that talks were faltering. Then as now, officials had suggested privately that an agreement was imminent.</p>
