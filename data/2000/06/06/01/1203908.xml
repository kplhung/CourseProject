        <p>Married, Advising Singles</p>
        <p>''Smile, Sarah, smile,'' shouted a man in the herd of photographers snapping away at SARAH JESSICA PARKER at a party for the HBO comedy series ''Sex and the City.'' Ms. Parker's smile turned into a laugh when she realized that the shout had come from CHRIS NOTH, one of her co-stars, who had borrowed the camera.</p>
        <p>To celebrate another season of ''Sex and the City,'' which begins Sunday, HBO rented a movie theater (the United Artists 64th Street, on Second Avenue) and showed the first two episodes to an invitation-only crowd. The rest of the cast, including CYNTHIA NIXON, KRISTIN DAVIS and KIM CATTRALL, was in the audience. There was also a contingent from the HBO series ''The Sopranos'' that included JAMES GANDOLFINI, LORRAINE BRACCO and AIDA TURTURRO.</p>

        <p>Married, Advising Singles</p>
        <p>''Smile, Sarah, smile,'' shouted a man in the herd of photographers snapping away at SARAH JESSICA PARKER at a party for the HBO comedy series ''Sex and the City.'' Ms. Parker's smile turned into a laugh when she realized that the shout had come from CHRIS NOTH, one of her co-stars, who had borrowed the camera.</p>
        <p>To celebrate another season of ''Sex and the City,'' which begins Sunday, HBO rented a movie theater (the United Artists 64th Street, on Second Avenue) and showed the first two episodes to an invitation-only crowd. The rest of the cast, including CYNTHIA NIXON, KRISTIN DAVIS and KIM CATTRALL, was in the audience. There was also a contingent from the HBO series ''The Sopranos'' that included JAMES GANDOLFINI, LORRAINE BRACCO and AIDA TURTURRO.</p>
        <p>''Sex and the City'' is about women dealing with noncommittal relationships, but at least two of the actresses on the show are in committed relationships: Ms. Parker celebrated her third wedding anniversary two weeks ago, and Ms. Nixon has lived with the professor and photographer DANIEL MOZES for 13 years. As the wife of MATTHEW BRODERICK, not as the  single sex-advice columnist she plays on the show, Ms. Parker offered this advice for single women in the city: ''Don't settle,'' she said. ''No compromises. Manhattan is rife with potential, full of unchartered, unexplored men.''</p>
        <p>So is Mr. Broderick comfortable with the on-screen frankness? ''My scenes tend to be less racy than some of the others,'' she said. ''He doesn't find too much to object to about what I do or what I've been asked to do on the show. He enjoys it. It's very whimsical and not gratuitous. And, frankly, he would never complain about the show. Matthew enjoys the perks and fringe benefits from HBO too much to have any complaints. That would mean no free tickets to the boxing matches and no early tapes from 'The Sopranos.' ''</p>
        <p>Talk Is All Business At Tea With Queen</p>
        <p>NELL MERLINO invited the queen over for tea yesterday -- QUEEN RANIA of Jordan -- and they talked about loans to women who own businesses. Nobody said anything about the little etiquette problem.</p>
        <p>Ms. Merlino is a founder of Count-Me-In.org, which lends money to women in smallish chunks ($500 to $10,000) and is based in her duplex apartment in Chelsea. ''I was standing in the kitchen because I had catered the thing,'' her sister, KATE, said, ''and the queen walked in and said, 'Hello, I'm Rania.' She asked for a cranberry juice, which, luckily, we had.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, Nell Merlino and the queen sat down to talk about their loan programs. Nell Merlino said that the queen described a lending program she had started in southern Jordan. Other guests, including KAY KOPLOVITZ, the cable-television executive, and MARIANNE  SPRAGGINS, the investment banker, joined the discussion.</p>
        <p>''The reason we started Count-Me-In and the reason she's doing what she's doing in Jordan are very similar,'' Nell Merlino said. ''We have a micro-lending program that's online. She's interested in expanding the reach.''</p>
        <p>Later, Nell Merlino gasped -- she said that she had addressed the queen incorrectly. ''I think I called her 'Your Highness,' '' she said. ''It's really 'Your Majesty.' ''</p>
        <p>Letters From Ron</p>
        <p>It's a history book. No, it's a romance. Maybe it's both. Random House said yesterday that it would publish a volume of letters from RONALD REAGAN to NANCY REAGAN that run from when they were dating in 1950 through 1994, when he announced that he had Alzheimer's disease. Random House said that the Reagans were giving their share of the money from the book to charity, including the Alzheimer's Foundation.</p>
        <p>''It is important, I think, to remember the happy times and the value of a life lovingly led, particularly now, given Ronnie's illness,'' Mrs. Reagan said in a statement.  KATE MEDINA, the vice president and executive editor of Random House, gave Mrs. Reagan credit for keeping the letters and for wanting to publish them. ''It was an idea of hers that gradually evolved,'' she said. ''I didn't talk her into it or anything.''</p>
