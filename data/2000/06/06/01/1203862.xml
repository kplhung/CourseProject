        <p>Creative Labs has upped the ante in the MP3 sweepstakes with the release of the new Nomad Jukebox.</p>
        <p>It can play music in most downloadable formats, including MP3 and WAV files and is about the size and shape of a heavy portable CD player, but it has a hefty six gigabytes of hard drive space. That's more than 90 times that of most smaller MP3 players.</p>

        <p>Creative Labs has upped the ante in the MP3 sweepstakes with the release of the new Nomad Jukebox.</p>
        <p>It can play music in most downloadable formats, including MP3 and WAV files and is about the size and shape of a heavy portable CD player, but it has a hefty six gigabytes of hard drive space. That's more than 90 times that of most smaller MP3 players.</p>
        <p>That means the Jukebox can hold up to 100 hours of music in the MP3 format, which is equal to the music on 150 music CD's.</p>
        <p>''One of the limitations in the MP3 player market has been lack of storage space.'' said Hector Martinez, a company spokesman.</p>
        <p>Those many audiophiles who do not believe the commonly heard claim that MP3's produce ''near CD sound quality'' can use the Nomad Jukebox to store less music but at higher speeds, up to 320 kilobits per second.</p>
        <p>The Jukebox can be plugged into a home computer through a U.S.B. port and can be played through car stereo systems or used with headphones.</p>
        <p>At a suggested retail price of $499, however, the cost matches a hefty hard drive.</p>
