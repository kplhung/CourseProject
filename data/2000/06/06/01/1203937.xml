        <p>U.S. and Phone Companies Agree to Some Rate Cuts  The federal government and many of the nation's telephone companies agreed to a reshuffling of phone rates that would reduce the bills of tens of millions of less affluent consumers and lead to less significant cuts for other consumers and businesses.</p>
        <p>Officials said the reductions, part of an agreement and an order by the Federal Communications Commission, amounted to the largest rate cut in the history of federal telephone regulation. [Page A1.]</p>

        <p>U.S. and Phone Companies Agree to Some Rate Cuts  The federal government and many of the nation's telephone companies agreed to a reshuffling of phone rates that would reduce the bills of tens of millions of less affluent consumers and lead to less significant cuts for other consumers and businesses.</p>
        <p>Officials said the reductions, part of an agreement and an order by the Federal Communications Commission, amounted to the largest rate cut in the history of federal telephone regulation. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>Daimler Ending Low-Rate Loans  DaimlerChrysler said it would eliminate most low-rate loans on new Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth cars and instead offer bigger cash rebates to consumers and new discounts to dealers. DaimlerChrysler's shift in strategy shows that the Federal Reserve's six increases in short-term interest rates are beginning to put pressure on the industry. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Kmart Names New Chief Executive  Kmart, which has been struggling to revive its sagging sales and stock price, reached outside the company for a new chief executive, selecting Charles Conaway, 39, left, the president and chief operating officer of the CVS Corporation, the drugstore chain. He succeeds Floyd Hall, who is stepping down after a search for his replacement that Kmart announced a month ago. [C10.]</p>
        <p>Nasdaq Gains Early but Ends Lower  After adding modestly to Tuesday's record advance, the Nasdaq composite index turned lower in the final hour and closed down 58.57 points, or 1.7 percent, at 3,400.91. The Dow Jones industrial average edged down 4.80 points, to 10,522.33, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.85 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,420.60. [C10.]</p>
        <p>Softbank Has Setback in Bank Bid  Softbank, Japan's leading Internet company, was dealt a setback in efforts to acquire Nippon Credit Bank, which was nationalized by the government, after a deadline for reaching an agreement passed. The Financial Reconstruction Commission said that it intended to keep talking to Softbank but that it would also talk to other potential bidders. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Hyundai Founder Vows Revamping  Hyundai Group's chairman announced radical changes that will severely diminish his family's management role and help South Korea's biggest conglomerate repay billions of dollars in debt through asset sales. But the announcement was nearly overshadowed by the refusal of the chairman's son to relinquish control of Hyundai's automaker. [C4.]</p>
        <p>New-Home Sales Slide 5.8%  New-home sales fell 5.8 percent in April, to an annual rate of 909,000 units. Purchasing managers in the Chicago area also reported that their factory index fell this month, and the Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators dropped in April for the second time in three months.

        <p>Invensys to Buy Software Maker  Invensys, a British manufacturer of factory controls, agreed to buy Baan, the Dutch software maker, for $802 million, promising to turn around the company, which has lost money and share value for nearly two years. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Managing Online Security Risks  Computer security researchers have tended to focus on cryptography and system design while neglecting the use of computers by ordinary people and incentives for avoiding fraud and abuse. It is time to legally assign liability for breakdowns in online security to those best able to manage the risks, which will lead to shifting most of those risks to insurers. Hal R.
