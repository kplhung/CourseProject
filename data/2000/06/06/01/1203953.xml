        <p>Ignoring the judge's assertion that he wanted no more briefs, Microsoft filed a detailed criticism of the government's breakup plan today, the last filing for the record before the judge rules on how to deal with the company's antitrust violations.</p>
        <p>The company's proposal significantly modifies nearly every element of the government's remedy plan, lengthening the amount of time the company would have to comply with the order and scaling back many proposals.</p>
        <p>The government proposal ''is defective in numerous respects, making the document vague and ambiguous'' and therefore ''void and unenforceable,'' the company's brief said.</p>
        <p>An earlier brief, filed on May 10, laid out Microsoft's broad objections to the remedy proposal. This one is a technical critique, attacking individual points in the plan, including e-mail retention rules, joint-venture restrictions and a requirement that Microsoft's senior managers certify within 90 days that they have read and understood the remedy ruling.</p>
        <p>Reacting to the Microsoft filing this evening, the Justice Department said: ''This is another effort to posture for appeal. The filing does not come to grips with the fact that Microsoft has been found to have repeatedly engaged in serious legal violations, and serious remedies are required.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft says it intends to appeal as soon as Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson rules on the remedy, a ruling that is expected Thursday or Friday. The judge has already suggested that he is inclined to  accept the government's recommendation that the company be broken up.</p>
        <p>Included in the Microsoft filing was a justification for the company's decision to place a long document called an offer of proof in the record during a court hearing on May 24, just before the judge ended the proceedings. The document included statements from witnesses the company would have called or quoted, had the judge held a hearing on remedies, as Microsoft requested.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department, also ignoring the judge's no-more-briefs edict, argued in a brief filed last Friday that the offer-of-proof filing was cynical and irresponsible. Today Microsoft called the government's accusations baseless and submitted an additional offer of proof.</p>
        <p>The latest offer includes statements from seven academic experts and corporate leaders who say they oppose the government's breakup plan and related remedy proposals. Among them are Michael Capellas, chief executive of Compaq Computer; Jeffrey Katzenberg, a founder of the DreamWorks motion picture studio; Olza M. Nicely, chairman of Geico, the insurance company; and John Whitacre, chief executive of Nordstrom, the department store chain based in Seattle, Microsoft's hometown.</p>
        <p>Among Mr. Capellas's complaints is the general concern that Microsoft would not be allowed to accord Compaq special treatment in pricing and partnerships.</p>
        <p>''Compaq is several times the size of the 20th-largest'' manufacturer, he wrote, and ''there is no reason why Compaq should not receive more resources from Microsoft, given our greater investment in testing, distributing and promoting Microsoft's technology.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Katzenberg wrote: ''If Microsoft were broken up -- as the government proposes -- Microsoft's operating systems, applications and other products over time would become less and less compatible, both with each other and with the various hardware products used by DreamWorks.''</p>
        <p>Before it critiqued the government's remedy proposal, Microsoft stressed once again that ''the relief requested by the government is extreme and unjustified.'' But while the company objected to the proposal in its entirety, it also picked apart nearly all of its parts, beginning with the first paragraph.</p>
        <p>There, the government gave Microsoft four months after the judge's ruling to submit a plan for breaking the company into two parts (though the actual breakup would be stayed until legal appeals are complete). Microsoft countered by lengthening the time to 12 months.</p>
        <p>The company notes that numerous federal agencies and foreign governments, in places where Microsoft has subsidiaries, would have to approve the breakup plan, and ''obtaining such approvals would be a time-consuming process.''</p>
        <p>The government plan would create two new companies; one would hold the Windows operating systems, the other everything else, including the Office suite of programs like Word for word processing and Excel for spreadsheet calculations.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, the applications company would have rights to Internet Explorer, the company's Web browser, and could license it back to the operating system company. But in today's brief, Microsoft makes the same argument it has put forward since 1997, that there is no such thing as a Web browser; Internet Explorer is merely a feature in Windows. Judge Jackson forcefully rejected that argument in his rulings.</p>
        <p>Along with the breakup plan, the government has proposed a long list of rules that would modify Microsoft's conduct. The company picked those apart, too. For one, it deleted a provision prohibiting Microsoft from making special marketing deals with computer makers -- the provision Mr. Capellas of Compaq also opposed. During the trial, the government showed that Microsoft sometimes used the special deals to reward companies that followed Microsoft's lead on issues of importance to the company.</p>
        <p>Among other changes, the company proposed to charge other companies ''a reasonable royalty'' for access to technical data about Windows needed to design programs that run with the operating system.</p>
        <p>The company also deleted a requirement that it retain all of the e-mail written by senior company managers for four years, calling the proposal ''overly broad and unduly burdensome.'' It was e-mail messages from company managers, including William H. Gates, the chairman, that formed the basis for the government's successful suit against Microsoft.</p>
