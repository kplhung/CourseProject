        <p>Patrik Elias was one of the architects for the Devils in the demolition of the Dallas Stars in the opening game of the Stanley Cup finals. Elias's passing skills helped Jason Arnott and Petr Sykora, his partners on the Devils' premier line, score two goals each in the 7-3 rout Tuesday night.

        <p>Patrik Elias was one of the architects for the Devils in the demolition of the Dallas Stars in the opening game of the Stanley Cup finals. Elias's passing skills helped Jason Arnott and Petr Sykora, his partners on the Devils' premier line, score two goals each in the 7-3 rout Tuesday night. And Elias helped get the Devils to this stage as he produced both goals in the deciding game against the Flyers in the Eastern Conference finals.</p>
        <p>Elias starred in the regular season as well, posting career highs in goals (35) and points (72), leading the team in both categories despite missing 10 games at the start of the season because of a contract dispute. The crafty and elusive left wing has simply picked up in the playoffs where he left off in the regular season, leading the team in points with 18, 1 more than Sykora and 2 more than Arnott.</p>
        <p>''We're clicking well right now,'' Elias said today after a team meeting to plan strategy for Game 2 against Dallas on Thursday night. ''None of us shy away from the puck,'' Elias said, sharing credit with Arnott and Sykora.</p>
        <p>Elias has shown a remarkable ability to mesh with Sykora, his countryman from the Czech Republic, and his pass for Sykora's first goal in the victory over Dallas in Game 1 had his teammates in awe.</p>
        <p>Collecting the puck on the left flank, Elias went behind the goal and seemed headed to the opposite side, but he surprised everyone by back-passing the puck to Sykora at goalie Ed Belfour's right doorstep for Sykora's first goal of the night.</p>
        <p>''It helps from the way we're raised and from the style of hockey we've played,'' Elias said of his combining with Sykora. ''On that play, I just happened to pass it to the near post and Petr was there.''</p>
        <p>Slava Fetisov, the former defenseman who is now an assistant to Coach Larry Robinson, has been particularly impressed by Elias.</p>
        <p>''He reminds me so much of Sergei Makarov,'' Fetisov said of his former teammate on the Soviet national team. ''He's an extremely intelligent hockey player.''</p>
        <p>Elias combined with Arnott and Sykora to produce the kind of numbers expected from Brett Hull and Mike Modano of the Dallas Stars. The Devils' threesome combined for 11 points from 4 goals and 7 assists.</p>
        <p>But the Devils do not want to look back.</p>
        <p>Bobby Holik spoke for nearly everyone when he said: ''Forget yesterday, it's done. We have another game tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Holik and others on the Devils said there was no overconfidence after knocking Belfour out of Game 1 and keeping the Stars' top line off the scoring sheet.</p>
        <p>''We know they didn't play their best game and they are capable of raising it a notch or two,'' Holik said.</p>
        <p>''The important thing for us is to play our game,'' Holik added, referring to the Devils' penalty-free performance.</p>
        <p>Martin Brodeur said the Devils were determined to capitalize on their chances the way they did in the first game. ''It seems that everything we threw at them went in,'' Brodeur said. ''We started with the home-ice advantage and if we don't win tomorrow we lose it.''</p>
        <p>Claude Lemieux said the Stars would be more physical in Game 2 and he did not expect another lopsided victory.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure they don't want to disappoint themselves two games in a row, but we're desperate, too,'' Lemieux said. ''What matters is that you're ready for the next game and you stick with the game plan. The plan is to get the puck in deep and do the things we can do best.''</p>
