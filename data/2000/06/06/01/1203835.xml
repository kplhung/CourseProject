        <p>At Eppraisals.com, a new Web site, it is possible to have antiques appraised online. It was started this spring by Leslie Hindman, who sold her Chicago auction house to Sotheby's in 1997. She has 700 experts who will evaluate digital photos of objects for a $20 fee.</p>
        <p>The House &amp; Home section sent digital photos of a majolica plate and McCoy tea set, below, to Eppraisals.com, which acknowledges that an item's condition is hard to judge in photos. Its experts evaluated the tea set at $100 and the majolica plate at $300, assuming both were in good condition.</p>

        <p>At Eppraisals.com, a new Web site, it is possible to have antiques appraised online. It was started this spring by Leslie Hindman, who sold her Chicago auction house to Sotheby's in 1997. She has 700 experts who will evaluate digital photos of objects for a $20 fee.</p>
        <p>The House &amp; Home section sent digital photos of a majolica plate and McCoy tea set, below, to Eppraisals.com, which acknowledges that an item's condition is hard to judge in photos. Its experts evaluated the tea set at $100 and the majolica plate at $300, assuming both were in good condition.</p>
        <p>Eric Silver, senior vice president at William Doyle Galleries, which provides free appraisals on Tuesday mornings, saw the tea set in person. ''How ugly,'' he said cheerfully, pointing out air bubbles and pitting. He referred us to Terry Kovel, co-author of ''Kovels' Antiques and Collectibles Price List'' (Crown, $15), who said that one in good condition was worth $100 but that she couldn't appraise it sight unseen. Majolica is hard to appraise, she said, because there are so many makers and patterns. But Eppraisals.com was at least willing to make a stab at it.</p>
