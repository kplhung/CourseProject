        <p>It is a case that has all the elements of a Dickens novel: an aspiring young lawyer with a helpful uncle and great expectations; a raft of poor relatives hoping to reclaim their inheritances; and a tangled legal snarl that would make the Jarndyce v. Jarndyce lawsuit of ''Bleak House'' seem as uncomplicated as a parking ticket.</p>
        <p>Concepcion Sauceda v. Gilbert Kerlin et al. -- the case that began today in State District Court here -- pits 500 relatives of Padre Jose Nicolas Balli, an 18th-century Roman Catholic priest, against a 90-year-old New York lawyer named Gilbert Kerlin.</p>
        <p>The Balli family members say Mr. Kerlin, described even by the opposing counsel as ''a brilliant lawyer,'' cheated some unsophisticated rural Hispanic families out of as much as $11 million in mineral revenues for ancestral lands he obtained from them more than 60 years ago. Mr. Kerlin says that the lands, on Padre Island near here, were never theirs to begin with and that he never needed to pay them any revenues.</p>
        <p>Once a desolate spit of sand and scrub brush, the 120-mile-long island is rich in oil and gas and is now home to dozens of high-rise condominiums, hundreds of residents, and the resort city of South Padre Island.</p>
        <p>''There was nothing to see but a Coast Guard station at the south end and a fishing shack that had been knocked apart by storms,'' recalled Mr. Kerlin in a 1996 deposition about the first time he saw Padre Island. ''Otherwise it was just a barren barrier reef with nothing out there but an occasional fishing expedition.''</p>
        <p>That was in 1938, and Mr. Kerlin, fresh out of Harvard Law School, had just been hired by a rich uncle, Frederic N. Gilbert, to buy the island after hearing about it from a Brownsville lawyer.</p>
        <p>The island is named for Padre Balli, who received the title to the land from King Carlos III of Spain for his work managing church funds. Padre Balli died in 1829, leaving the majority of the land to a nephew, Juan Jose Balli, and his descendants.</p>
        <p>In 1830, Juan Balli sold the land to Santiago Morales for $700, but Mr. Morales apparently suffered buyer's remorse and soon wanted his money back. Juan Balli repaid the $700, but the reversal of the sale was never officially recorded.</p>
        <p>Almost 100 years later, Mr. Kerlin set about trying to buy as much of the land as he could for his uncle, though in the intervening century, the island had been split into many smaller parcels as members of the Balli family married and died.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerlin hired a member of the family, Primitivo Balli, to reconstruct the family tree and eventually signed 11 contracts with various  Balli descendants and others in which they gave Mr. Gilbert 60,000 acres of Padre Island and the Laguna Madre, the strip of water that separates the island from the mainland, in exchange for a share of any revenues from oil and gas wells, according to court records.</p>
        <p>In the 1950's Mr. Kerlin acquired the Padre Island interests of his uncle, who has since died.</p>
        <p>The families may also have received some cash for the deeds, but the heirs are unsure how much. Mr. Kerlin's lawyer, M. Steve Smith, told jurors this morning only that Mr. Gilbert and his partners had lost $80,000 in the transactions.</p>
        <p>''Juan Balli had sold his share of Padre Island to Santiago Morales in the 1800's,'' Mr. Smith said. ''The Ballis sold Mr. Kerlin nothing in 1938 because they had nothing to sell. Their deeds are worthless.</p>
        <p>''There was fraud and deception here all right, but it was on the part of the Ballis.''</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs angrily disagree.</p>
        <p>''They stole that land,'' said Bertha Reyes, 56, who married into the Balli family, as she waited outside the courtroom. ''Those poor people they got the deeds from couldn't even read and write English, much less understand a legal contract.''</p>
        <p>Court records are filled with examples of Balli family members questioning Mr. Kerlin about the original deal and about whether or not any oil and gas revenues were due them, but for more than six decades he has managed to put them off, arguing that their titles to the land were questionable.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the Balli descendants produced evidence today, however,  that Mr. Kerlin had used the titles at least twice in earlier court cases to defend his rights to the property.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Smith told the court that Mr. Kerlin had used other subsequent transactions perfected with ''superior titles'' to prove his claim to the land over the years.</p>
        <p>On Friday, the judge in the case, Pat McDowell of Dallas, ordered lawyers and plaintiffs not to discuss the lawsuit, and outside the courtroom today both Mr. Kerlin and Mr. Smith said they did not have time to talk about the case.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Reyes, whose mother-in-law is a direct Balli descendant, was outspoken. She said her mother-in-law told her that the family ''owned Padre Island and they were to be paid $50 a month rent for their land.''</p>
        <p>'' That's all they thought they were doing, renting the land,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Family members say they never received any oil or gas revenues from Mr. Kerlin, and one branch of the family filed a lawsuit in 1993 to collect at least $11 million in oil royalties they believe they are owed.</p>
        <p>As news of that lawsuit spread, other family members began questioning the terms of the deeds and filed other suits that were combined into the single court case now being heard in Brownsville.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerlin sold most of the surface rights in 1971, according to the Balli family lawyer, Britt Monts, but kept the mineral rights and continues to earn money from them.</p>
        <p>After describing Mr. Kerlin as ''a charming man, and sharp as a tack,''  Mr. Monts told jurors: ''He has been paid substantial sums of money from oil wells on that property that he should have shared with the Balli family.''</p>
