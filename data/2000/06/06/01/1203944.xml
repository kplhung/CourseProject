        <p>The crash of bowling pins. Fifty-cent Budweisers. The Jersey Devils on the big television beating the pants off their Stanley Cup rivals.</p>
        <p>Life doesn't get much better at the Knights of Columbus lounge, a dark and smoky cocoon where generations of stevedores, crane operators and refinery workers have drunk away their daily aches.</p>
        <p>During a break in the hockey game, it was time again for the politicians to sell their wares. Like clockwork, the guy with the bold ideas and the bottomless bank account appeared on the bar's half-dozen screens.</p>
        <p>Lou Rodrique, 75, drained his glass of beer as Jon S. Corzine, the Wall Street multimillionaire, took over the room. Through the din, an announcer could be heard saying something nasty about former Gov. Jim Florio, Mr. Corzine's opponent in next Tuesday's Democratic primary for the United States Senate. Mr. Rodrique, a World War II Navy veteran who worked at the Exxon refinery until it followed the other oil companies out of town, turned away and nearly spat with disdain.</p>
        <p>''I just don't get it,'' he said. ''I don't trust a guy who's spending this kind of money for a job that pays so little. There's gotta be something in it for him.''</p>
        <p>In a few short weeks, Mr. Corzine's $30 million juggernaut has transformed him from an obscure hopeful into a household name who, recent polls say, is the man to beat. But if the diehard Democrats in this fraying blue-collar town are any indication, Mr. Corzine may be overdoing his lavish spending campaign, one that is quickly making this Senate race the most expensive in American history.</p>
        <p>There is little love expressed for elected officials here in Bayonne, and many residents still curse the tax increase championed by Mr. Florio a decade ago when he was governor. But even though Mr. Corzine bills himself as the independent outsider, his relentless advertising blitz and bottomless war chest are spurring a quiet backlash in some quarters.</p>
        <p>Despite the support Mr. Corzine has won from Bayonne's Democratic leadership and the state's largest labor unions, many voters here say they will cast their lot with Mr. Florio, a man some now see as an embattled underdog, someone who might understand what it's like to be frustrated by a changing world.</p>
        <p>''They're all a bunch of lying crooks,'' said Mr. Rodrique with the swat of his hand. ''But I go for the little guy.''</p>
        <p>Then there is Joe Paszek, 44, a local postal worker who admits he is not following the race but is sure of one thing: ''I'm sick of all those Corzine ads.''</p>
        <p>Sipping a beer at the Big Apple, a popular sports bar studded with 30 television screens, Mr. Paszek did not have to wait long before his gripe was borne out. ''You see, you can't avoid the guy,'' he said. ''Yuck.''</p>
        <p>In interviews, it was not hard to find those enchanted by Mr. Corzine and his commercials, although many confessed they had little sense of what the former Goldman Sachs executive stood for.</p>
        <p>For some, it is enough to cheer on the person who is not Mr. Florio, a man many blame for the $2.8 million tax that was enacted while he was governor. For others, like George Bowe, 66, Mr. Corzine's self-generated wealth is to be admired. ''It's not like he robbed a bank,'' said Mr. Bowe, a truck driver. ''Either way, he's coming from nowhere, so he's got to get his name out there.''</p>
        <p>And then there are those like Tommy Akel, 40, a shaggy-haired longshoreman, who says Mr. Corzine's riches make him a free man. ''No one can tell him what to do,'' said Mr. Akel, who plays the drums in a heavy-metal band called Attacker. ''If he wins, they can't hold nothing over his head.''</p>
        <p>Still, up and down Broadway, the town's ailing commercial strip, most people held little hope that either candidate would have any impact on their two-square-mile peninsula.</p>
        <p>Once a working man's paradise, Bayonne has lost nearly all of its big employers in recent years, from Texaco, which left behind 40 acres of tainted land, to the Army, which last year abandoned the Military Ocean Terminal, a huge complex that once employed 2,500 people.</p>
        <p>Despite all the changes, Bayonne has weathered its economic traumas relatively well. Taxes are high, but crime is low and the schools are still among the best in Hudson County. The city of 61,000 has always been cushioned from the outside world by the water on three sides.</p>
        <p>Unlike most of urban New Jersey, and especially its closest neighbors, Newark, Jersey City and Elizabeth, Bayonne is still dominated by ethnic whites, mostly the children of Polish, Italian and Irish immigrants. It is the kind of town where American flags flutter on every other porch. Democrats here outnumber Republicans 10 to 1, although voters will gladly cross party lines for the right candidate.</p>
        <p>Leonard P. Kiczek, a former mayor who produces and is the host of a cable program called ''Bayonne Today,'' predicted that few residents would vote in Tuesday's primary. ''Folks here are busy working,'' he said. ''Unless there's a burning issue, they're not going to the polls.''</p>
        <p>Robert Bailey, an associate professor of public policy at Rutgers University at Camden, said that he, too, sensed widespread apathy among working-class voters. He said he believed that the indifference would only grow as more people learned about Mr. Corzine's $400 million personal fortune and unprecedented spending habits.</p>
        <p>''I think it reinforces the perception that the entire political process is a money game, not a political game,'' he said. ''I think this really busts the scale.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's strategists might be heartened to meet Mark Minski, a refinery worker and part-time student who was hanging out with some friends in front of Showcase Hairstyling on Broadway. At 25, Mr. Minski hasn't seen too many Senate campaigns, but he knows a thing or two about life in Bayonne. Jobs are scarce, taxes are high and politicians rarely speak the truth, he said. Although he hasn't been following the race, he said he had seen a few of the Corzine commercials on television.</p>
        <p>''I saw the one that said Florio's tax hikes hurt the middle class,'' he said, as his friends nodded in agreement. ''Well, we're all middle class. So I guess we're getting hurt. I'll probably support the other guy.''</p>
        <p>Down the block at Steve's Comet Shoe Repair, the owners, Jean and Steve Attardi, were sitting in the shop's shoeshine chairs, talking politics with an upstairs neighbor, Margie Dorzdowski.</p>
        <p>Only one customer had come in all day, but that didn't bother the Attardis, who own the building and get by on Social Security. These days the shop, which they opened 45 years ago, serves largely as a social club for the couple and their friends.</p>
        <p>Shouting over one another, their voices growing increasingly agitated, the Attardis bemoaned what they called a new era of big money and empty promises. Mostly, though, they pitied Mr. Florio.</p>
        <p>''Corzine has got all the money; it's just not fair,'' said Mr. Attardi, 85. ''It's just not fair.''</p>
        <p>''The right man never gets elected,'' said his wife, who is 80. ''The poor guy never wins.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Attardi shook his head and made a sour face. ''It never used to be that way,'' he said. ''Why does he have to steal the election?''</p>
        <p>And so it went, until Mrs. Dorzdowski, 78, a retired factory worker, broke in. ''What are you talking about?'' she asked gruffly. ''Politicians. Rich or poor, they're all the same. They promise you the moon, and they give you nothing in return.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 3, 2000, Saturday  An article on Thursday about resentment among blue-collar voters in Bayonne, N.J., against Jon S. Corzine's record spending in the Democratic primary for United States Senate misstated the size of the state tax increase championed in 1990 by his opponent, Jim Florio, who was then governor. It was $2.8 billion, not $2.8 million.</p>
