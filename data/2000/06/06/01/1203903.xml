        <p>The dominant emotion at this week's New York State Republican convention was relief that Representative Rick Lazio has stepped in to replace Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as the party's Senate nominee.

        <p>The dominant emotion at this week's New York State Republican convention was relief that Representative Rick Lazio has stepped in to replace Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as the party's Senate nominee. Sometimes this relief was unspoken, but in a surprising number of cases, top Republicans expressed it openly.</p>
        <p>''I can tell you there was a lot of nervousness two weeks ago,'' said Georgette Mosbacher, a prominent fund-raiser. ''Under everyone's breath we were saying, my God, can Rick raise the money? Are we too late? But no, the segue from Rudy to Rick was absolutely seamless.''</p>
        <p>Well, maybe not absolutely seamless. In a hastily scripted two-hour event there were enough miscues to remind most seasoned viewers that this was a campaign still suffering through its toddler stage. The text of the speech handed out to the media, for example, was still titled ''Draft 13.'' The unlucky rewrite contained stage directions for how Mr. Lazio was to punctuate a story about learning the value of labor from his father, who made the boy earn money for a baseball glove by working in the family store. ''At pretty low wages, I remember,'' the text read, then added in parentheses, ''(Smile).'' Mr. Lazio did.</p>
        <p>The candidate's boyish smile, of course, was a bit lopsided after the fall on Monday that left him with a stitched lip. He probably won some points for campaigning gamely along, but a more seasoned staff would have thought to reposition the media platforms so that the cameras were not forced to focus on the swollen side of the candidate's face. And when Mr. Lazio's speech strayed past 5 p.m., he was suddenly competing with seven television personalities brazenly doing their live stand-ups so loudly that it became difficult to hear the candidate.</p>
        <p>These are the kinds of rough spots that political reporters are trained to notice and the party faithful are conditioned to ignore. In the main, you could feel the 2,000 Republican leaders gathered in Buffalo settling into their comfort zone, sighing about how scrubbed and energetic their candidate is, how clean-cut he is, how home-grown. In fact, the whole idea of Mr. Lazio's nomination seemed to be that he is the only insider here, the outsider being Hillary Rodham Clinton, who moved to Westchester County last year from the White House.</p>
        <p>The Erie County executive, Joel Giambra, fed the party line by noting that it was time to elect a senator who ''played little league football in this state.'' A colleague offered the contrast that Mr. Lazio has paid taxes in New York State for many years. And Gov. George Pataki summed it up by saying, ''Rick Lazio is one of us.''</p>
        <p>Such was the zeal to embrace the carpetbagger strategy that no one seemed to consider that ''one of us'' can be a loaded political message, especially coming from a convention that had about as many blacks and Hispanics as your average private golf club. More important for Mr. Lazio, there are a lot of voters in New York State who may not be as new to the state as Mrs. Clinton but still do not qualify as ''one of'' a party that has already maxed out its support among white suburbanites.</p>
        <p>Even some Republicans, like Mayor Giuliani, do not fit easily in this upstate conservative clubhouse. The mayor, who had the good sense not to appear in Buffalo and muddy Mr. Lazio's message, is still known in this crowd as the man who endorsed Mario Cuomo. That Mr. Giuliani is allowed to call himself a Republican is a source of amazement to some G.O.P. insiders, not a few of whom work for Governor Pataki.</p>
        <p>The Giuliani departure clearly pleased some on the Pataki team, but it also sets up a key test of the governor's power. If Rudy Giuliani  ran against the first lady and lost, Mr. Pataki could shrug it off as the mayor's problem, not his or the party's. If Mr. Lazio loses, some of the blame will settle on his coach in the governor's office and on this convention's us-versus-them message.</p>
        <p>For the moment, though, Republicans seem united in celebrating a candidate who is not only the anti-Hillary but also the non-Rudy. The G.O.P. leadership is betting that as a candidate who lacks the polarizing features of both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Lazio can command broad if bland swatches of the middle ground. Hence the concentrated effort by so many speakers to depict the first lady as an invading Nurse Ratched. That may work, but a campaign to make Ms. Clinton into a fearsome outsider could also turn Rick Lazio into Ricky Nelson. In such a match, some of those swing voters might wind up going for the more forceful character after all.</p>
