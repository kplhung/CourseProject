        <p>The Giants' changeover at middle linebacker was made official today during the team's minicamp when Corey Widmer, the starter at the position for the last four seasons, was not at the Giants Stadium workouts. The job now belongs to Mike Barrow, the Giants' principal off-season free-agent acquisition.</p>
        <p>In the next few days, the veteran fullback Charles Way will also be removed from the roster, choosing to retire before the team declares him medically unfit because of a chronic right knee problem.</p>
        <p>Way had hoped to convince the Giants that in time his knee would have been strong enough to resume playing, but team officials have indicated the consensus is that Way's knee is not sound.</p>
        <p>The moves will eliminate two of the Giants' more seasoned players, and in Way's case, deprive the team's young offense of a popular player and charismatic leader. The Giants will very likely now seriously pursue the free-agent fullback Sam Gash, who was released by the Buffalo Bills last month.</p>
        <p>Widmer, who missed time late last season with a lower back injury, will become a salary-cap casualty when he is released Thursday or soon thereafter, saving the Giants $1.8 million.</p>
        <p>Way was scheduled to make $1 million in salary and could have earned $700,000 in incentives.</p>
        <p>Giants Coach Jim Fassel today was vague about the status of Widmer and Way, trying to avert an awkward situation brought on by the timing of the minicamp and salary- cap guidelines that make waiting another 24 hours fiscally advantageous.</p>
        <p>''We've talked to Corey,'' Fassel said. ''From a lot of aspects, he doesn't need to be here.''</p>
        <p>Way was at Giants Stadium but did not participate in the workouts. Between the morning and afternoon workouts today, he said the Giants doctors recommended that he retire after last season. Way, 27, instead opted for more surgery on his right knee, which has been troubling him since the beginning of the 1998 season. ''I told them I thought I still had a few seasons left,'' Way said. ''And they said, 'We'll see.' ''</p>
        <p>Way has resumed running and is encouraged about his progress, but tellingly, no one associated with the Giants has had anything positive to say about Way's rehabilitation.</p>
        <p>''I don't think they want me to hurt myself,'' Way said today.</p>
        <p>Way, the team's sixth-round draft pick in 1995, was the Giants' leading rusher during their division-winning 1997 season with 698 yards. Those rushing totals fell to 432 yards in 1998 as Way -- busy in a variety of roles -- seemed to wear down. Last season, Way rushed for just 141 yards on 49 carries. He missed the last five games of the season with his knee injury.</p>
        <p>Widmer, a seventh-round 1992 Giants draft pick and a former college defensive lineman, was one of the team's most durable players, starting 64 games in the last six seasons, including 13 last year when he had 62 tackles. But Widmer's role began to change in the last few seasons when he left games in all passing situations.</p>
        <p>Barrow signed a six-year, $24 million contract with the Giants after being cut by the Carolina Panthers. At 240 pounds, he is prototypical of the newer, quicker linebacker that has become a league trend. But there is some risk to that move, too. While Barrow has played every linebacking position in a seven-year career, he has not played middle linebacker in the 4-3 defense the Giants employ since his rookie year in 1993.</p>
        <p>But Fassel said the Giants have decided that Barrow's best spot is in the middle even though they considered having him supplant Ryan Phillips at the strongside linebacker's spot.</p>
        <p>Sehorn Needs to Lighten Up</p>
        <p>Jason Sehorn said today that it was a mistake to try to play cornerback at nearly 230 pounds last season. ''It's not something I did intentionally,'' Sehorn said. ''But when I was at 227 and playing corner, that's a little heavy.''</p>
        <p>Sehorn said he hoped to weigh about 210 pounds by the start of training camp in July.</p>
        <p>Conrad Hamilton, who was expected to be the starter at left cornerback, is still troubled by an ailing right knee and was not working out today. Coach Jim Fassel said Dave Thomas, a free agent from Jacksonville who signed this winter, was now competing for the starting left cornerback's job.</p>
