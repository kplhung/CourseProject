        <p>President Clinton and senior European Union officials met today on four major trade disputes dividing them but failed to make any progress, a senior administration official said.</p>
        <p>The issues were apparently so difficult that Mr. Clinton, Romano Prodi, the president of the European Commission, and Prime Minister Antonio Guterres of Portugal, who currently holds the rotating European Union presidency, did not even make a serious attempt to resolve them.</p>
        <p>They spent 20 minutes of their 75-minute working meeting at the Queluz Palace, a small-scale version of Versailles outside of Lisbon, discussing trade. The rest was devoted to Russia and security issues like Kosovo and European defense. Their hourlong working lunch focused on economic issues, like commerce on the Internet, and infectious diseases.</p>
        <p>In an unusually blunt public assessment for such a high-level meeting, Lael Brainard, the deputy national economic adviser, made no effort to put a positive spin on it.</p>
        <p>Briefing reporters, she described the trade talks as ''a lively and frank exchange on areas where our views differ.'' Asked specifically whether any progress had been made on outstanding issues, Ms. Brainard said, ''There was no progress at this meeting.''</p>
        <p>The meetings today, on the first stop of Mr. Clinton's last scheduled trip to Europe as president, underscored how little time he has to shape foreign policy before he leaves office in eight months.</p>
        <p>In his opening remarks at a joint news conference in the formal garden of the palace after the meetings, he struck a retrospective note, saying he wanted to put the talks into ''some historical perspective.'' He listed what he called Europe's achievements in promoting democracy and economic prosperity during the past eight years. ''I thank all of those who have supported those developments,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>In emotional words of his own, the effusive Mr. Prodi, a former Italian prime minister, said he wanted to pay tribute to Mr. Clinton's support of the European Union during his administration. He said it was fitting that Mr. Clinton would receive the Charlemagne Prize later this week, an award given to those who promote Europe's goals. Mr. Clinton is ''a European,'' Mr. Prodi said, adding, ''You belong to our family, really.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps it was the blinding sun in Mr. Clinton's eyes that made him blink as Mr. Prodi spoke. In the afternoon, Mr. Clinton played golf for several hours with his national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, just outside of Lisbon.</p>
        <p>At the news conference, Mr. Clinton spent most of his time fielding questions on subjects other than trade. In his most extensive remarks on the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon, he called the decision by Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel ''daring.'' He added, ''It changed the landscape.'' But Mr. Clinton also warned that the withdrawal ''imposes a much greater sense of urgency'' on all the parties to agree to a blueprint that is supposed to lead to a permanent peace agreement. Israel and the Palestinians are still grappling with unresolved issues like the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements on occupied land, borders and the future of about four million Palestinian refugees.</p>
        <p>''There is both greater potential for something happening and also greater tension in the atmosphere,'' Mr. Clinton said, ''which is causing a ripple effect in the relationship between the Israelis and the Palestinians.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton confirmed that a private meeting he will have with Mr. Barak, originally scheduled for Berlin on Thursday night, had been switched to Lisbon on Thursday morning at the request of Mr. Barak, who, in the face of domestic opposition, decided he needed to be in Israel for a state ceremony marking Jerusalem Unification Day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, who is scheduled to leave for Germany later on Thursday, also spoke by telephone with the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat. ''President Clinton emphasized a commitment to do everything he can to move the process forward,'' a senior administration official said.</p>
        <p>Asked at the news conference about an American plan to develop a limited missile defense, which has been much criticized by America's European partners, Mr. Clinton reiterated his view that the United States faced a new nuclear threat and would be willing to share its technology with other ''civilized nations.'' If the technology for such a system is developed, he said, ''it would be unethical'' for the United States to hoard it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's proposal to modify the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to allow for the deployment of a limited missile defense system, as well as Russia's conduct in the war in Chechnya, will be at the top of the agenda when he meets for the first time with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, in Moscow this weekend. Mr. Putin has vociferously opposed amending the treaty, a landmark of cold war arms control.</p>
        <p>''We've done a lot of information-sharing already with the Russians,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''We've offered to do more.''</p>
        <p>The Europeans are not sanguine about a modification of the treaty either. Mr. Guterres, Portugal's prime minister, said today that any move toward a missile-defense system would have to be agreed to ''by everybody'' and would have to take into account ''everyone's preoccupations in this matter.''</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, President Jacques Chirac of France said he was worried that the missile defense system would spark a new global arms race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton played down the prospects for any major breaktrough in Moscow.</p>
        <p>''I would be surprised if we bridge all of our differences on Chechnya, and I would be surprised if we resolved all our differences on the question of missile defense, although we might make more headway than most people expect,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As for trade, trade between the United States and the 15-member European Union represents more than 40 percent of the world's share, but the two sides are locked in a protracted and public struggle over a series of conflicts in which neither has shown much willingness to compromise.</p>
        <p>The American side objects to European restrictions on the importation of bananas, a ban on American beef produced with growth hormones and the subsidizing by European governments of a new double-deck passenger jet built by the European consortium Airbus Industrie.</p>
        <p>More recently, the European Union has objected to a tax break that the United States grants to major corporations that set up operations in offshore tax havens like the Virgin Islands and Barbados. These companies are not required to pay American sales tax and duties -- from 10 to 30 percent -- on their exports. The European Union argues that the tax relief that benefits 6,000 exporters, including corporate giants like Boeing, General Motors and Microsoft, is a form of subsidy that will amount to about $25 billion to United States companies during the next five years.</p>
        <p>Because of the European Union's position on bananas and beef, the World Trade Organization has allowed the United States to impose more than $300 million in import penalties against the European Union. The Europeans are infuriated by the American retaliatory import tax on goods such as Roquefort cheese and foie gras.</p>
