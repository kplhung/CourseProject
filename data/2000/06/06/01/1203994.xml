        <p>You walk by each cubicle in the visitor's locker room at Conseco Fieldhouse, and you get the same hangdog look from each of them. They cannot tell you exactly where Game 5 went or how it got so bad so fast in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>To most of the Knicks, the night in which their offense broke down and their effort followed is a blur, 48 minutes of some unexplainable phenomenon that overtook their bodies for about 12 minutes in the first half.</p>
        <p>''We didn't move the ball side to side,'' Chris Childs said after the Knicks gave back an 18-point lead and lost, 88-79, tonight. ''We wouldn't take the first early shot we had. We were too stagnant. We ended up taking a lot of shots with three or four seconds left on the shot clock. You're not going to shoot a high percentage when that's when you're taking all your shots.''</p>
        <p>No one said the return of Patrick Ewing was the main culprit, nor would they place blame on Indiana's renewed commitment to defense. But somewhere between 32-17, Knicks, after one quarter, and 42-40, Pacers, at halftime, something awfully disturbing happened to this team.</p>
        <p>''We beat ourselves,'' Childs added. ''We got away from what we did well. I don't know why. It's hard to explain. They completely slowed the game down and we bought into it. We can't slow it down.''</p>
        <p>Allan Houston said: ''I just wanted to keep playing the same way, go up 30 and keep attacking. For whatever reason, we didn't do it. I can't say for sure how that happened.''</p>
        <p>Here's a clue: The Knicks genuinely thought they had this game won, that their weekend spree at Madison Square Garden and their first quarter onslaught in Game 5 was enough to shake the Pacers for good.</p>
        <p>Instead, the Pacers began giving it back, going after loose balls, flying through the lane without a care for their health. And the Knicks were suddenly the frustrated, poor-shooting team unable to find a rhythm.</p>
        <p>The Knicks gave up five offensive rebounds in the second quarter, including three on one possession. The Pacers played with a confidence befitting a team with a 3-2 series lead, a team tired of the Knicks' swagger.</p>
        <p>It was the middle of the third quarter, and Mark Jackson, having been outplayed by the most-maligned starting point guard in pro basketball for much of the series, had had enough. He backed Charlie Ward into the post for the second straight time, pounding the ball hard to the floor before releasing another soft jump hook that rolled around and down.</p>
        <p>Jackson mockingly flashed what he later said was a ''cross'' sign toward the Knicks bench after he scored -- a variation of Larry Johnson's ''Big L'' sign.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Reggie Miller finished a 3-pointer over Houston by staring down the Knicks guard as if he had committed some heinous act against a close relative.</p>
        <p>The Knicks often live to display their cocksure behavior, preen for America and NBC, bump chests until the cameras stop rolling. But this is what their swagger sometimes begets, this is the other half of showing up your opponent.</p>
        <p>''Hey, we gave it out,'' Latrell Sprewell said. ''You got to be able to take it.</p>
        <p>Indiana showed some of the character Larry Bird had been imploring them to show, especially Miller, Jalen Rose and Travis Best, who finally uncorked offensively before he dribbled the shot clock and the series away.</p>
        <p>But that 10-minute, 23-3 run in the second quarter said so much about New York's ability to deal with prosperity.</p>
        <p>''You would hope we would learn from that,'' Childs said, referring to their Game 5 meltdown against Miami. ''We knew what to expect and how to react. But we couldn't do it.</p>
        <p>''Patrick was great. He was a big reason why we got out to that lead, so to point the finger at him is unfair. He did a great job. We just slowed down as a team, stopped doing the things that got us to where we were.''</p>
        <p>It is hard to completely knock this crew about what they have been through. Rewind to that Game 5 loss in Miami that seemed a millennium ago, and it is clear they do their best work when their tank is flickering on empty.</p>
        <p>But anyone who watched Derrick McKey hunt down an errant rebound on the right baseline in front of the Knick bench with four and half minutes left tonight had to wonder how much those two wins at the Garden last Saturday and Monday convinced the Knicks they were finals-bound.</p>
        <p>For all the great play Ward has summoned in this series, neither he nor Childs had an answer for Best and Jackson, who combined for 35 points and 10 assists to the Knick backcourt's 14 points and 10 assists.</p>
        <p>A little anecdote from practice on Tuesday told you a lot about this team. Johnson began laughing, breaking up over the newfound celebrity of Ward. It was not enough that they were chanting Ward's name last weekend at the Garden. But holding court in the rotunda after the game, using sarcasm and wit in front of the cameras?</p>
        <p>''Hey, C. Ward, I heard you were up at the podium yesterday,'' Johnson said. ''Man, that's just like Florida State.''</p>
        <p>It was a nice, light-hearted moment for the former Heisman Trophy winner, but there was something altogether premature about it. After all, the series was merely knotted at 2-2.</p>
        <p>Somehow, they have once again set themselves up for such a predicament in Game 6 at the Garden on Friday night. If Mark Jackson is crossing his arms toward the bench then, consider their swagger and their resolve tapped out.</p>
        <p>Asked if their injuries might be too much to overcome, Ewing, his right foot submerged in a bucket of ice water, said: ''Ask me that after the season is over, when we win the championship.''</p>
        <p>They really do love to live on the edge, don't they?</p>
