        <p>When the Europeans last week offered Israel a way out of its painful isolation at the United Nations, the move brought a cheer from Israeli diplomats here and the American Jewish leaders who had campaigned for this prize.</p>
        <p>But decades of slights and assaults had taken a toll on Israeli confidence in the United Nations, so there was hesitation until almost the last minute among the Israelis about whether to accept the offer.</p>
        <p>The urgings of European friends and the intercession of Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke with Israel's foreign minister, David Levy, led Israel to accept less than it wanted, hoping to get the rest later.</p>
        <p>An important factor, diplomats said, was a determination by Prime Minister Ehud Barak to put a higher priority on a full role for Israel in the United Nations, a goal not given much importance by his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
        <p>What was formally offered to Israel last Friday night, and formally accepted on Tuesday, was temporary membership in a regional caucus, the Western European and Other Group, known in United Nations jargon as WEOG. Without membership in a regional group, a country can never hope to be elected to important councils and committees in the United Nations system.</p>
        <p>Until last week, Israel, a member of the United Nations since 1949, has been barred from the Asian caucus, which includes the Middle East, since regional groups were organized in the 1960's. It was the only country banned from any group.</p>
        <p>Israel's eventual victory was bittersweet, however. It has been asked to forgo the chance to hold the most influential seats, including on the Security Council, at least for the foreseeable future. And the invitation did not include the right to take part in European caucuses in Geneva, the United Nations' European headquarters, or in centers in Vienna and Nairobi.</p>
        <p>Geneva is particularly important, Yehuda Lancry, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations said in an interview today. The United Nations Human Rights Commission, a perennial critic of Israel, meets there, and several important United Nations agencies have their headquarters in Geneva. Of all the concessions Israel had to make, ''that one constituted a problem for us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''We understand that our membership is on a temporary basis, and we accept that,'' Mr. Lancry said, adding that Israel still has hopes of entering the Asian bloc when peace efforts succeed in the Middle East. But, he said, fuller participation will  give Israel the ''ability to express itself among the family of nations, to be able to channel its creativity, its energy, its spirit.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lancry said he had been advised to accept what was offered. ''Taking into consideration that we were out for more than four decades of the spheres of influence, the opportunity was rare and precious and the decision had to be made, and we made it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lancry said he had to counter strong pressures on the Europeans from Arab and other Islamic nations, whose leaders wanted Israel's membership in the European group -- which also includes Canada, New Zealand, Australia and sometimes the United States -- held hostage to Palestinian and other regional demands.</p>
        <p>Arab reaction to the move to admit Israel to the European group has been muted in recent days. At a lunch today that Ambassador Holbrooke gave for Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, three envoys from Islamic nations congratulated Mr. Lancry. Diplomats regard this as at least a truce.</p>
        <p>David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee, which has led the campaign on behalf of Israel since 1993 through quiet diplomacy at the United Nations and European capitals, culminating three years ago in the sponsorship of full-page advertising in influential newspapers, said today that the fight is not over, however.</p>
        <p>''This is a major step forward, but no one should engage in self-deception,'' said Mr. Harris, who returned today from Geneva, where he was elected the new head of U.N. Watch, a private monitoring group.</p>
        <p>''Israel remains still unequal, and the conditions imposed on Israel reveal that fact.</p>
        <p>''The danger here is that people will conclude that Israel's problems have been solved totally, when in fact they have not.''</p>
        <p>Israel's drive for membership in a regional caucus within the United Nations and the consequent chance to take part more fully in the organization's work has been a goal of Israeli governments for decades. During the cold war, however, Israel became the target of a General Assembly majority of leftist, third-world and Islamic nations. The nadir of Israel's relations with the organization came in the mid-1970's, when the General Assembly voted to equate Zionism with racism, a move that alienated many American intellectuals from the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Although the end of the cold war enabled President George Bush to have the Zionism resolution rescinded by the assembly, a changing world atmosphere did little to help Israel generally in the United Nations until very recently, when the Barak government came to power and accelerated efforts to settle with its neighbors and the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>''The Europeans spent the last decade blaming each other,'' an American official said today. Just when one country would lift objections to Israeli membership, another would find a reason to block it. Belgium, Germany and Sweden were Israel's strongest friends and supporters, while objections came from Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and sometimes France.</p>
        <p>Last year, a breakthrough occurred, diplomats said, when France -- where Mr. Lancry was Israel's ambassador at the time -- swung around to support of Israel. At the same time, the Clinton administration began to lobby European leaders at the highest levels, including King Juan Carlos of Spain, whose country proved to be the last holdout.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright spoke to European foreign ministers and at the United Nations Mr. Holbrooke began to tackle envoys.</p>
        <p>Then help came from an unexpected quarter. In speeches, Secretary General Kofi Annan began to call attention to Israel's isolation in strong terms. In a speech in New York in December, Mr. Annan said that ''it sometimes seems that the United Nations served all the world's people but one: the Jews.''</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Annan welcomed the European decision, saying that it ''rectifies a longstanding anomaly.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Harris emphasized that it was important that Mr. Barak's government finally decided to give a clear signal to the European Union. ''At some point, Israel got off the fence,'' he said. ''Until they decided to go for it, it wasn't even clear to many of the WEOG members whether this was important enough to Israel to pursue.''</p>
        <p>Israel's cold feet did not finally warm until last Monday, however, diplomats said today. Mr. Levy, the Israeli foreign minister, was still concerned that Israel could be making a mistake by taking only a limited offer. The problem was Geneva.</p>
        <p>The United States made one more promise, and added a warning, diplomats said. If Israel accepted the European offer, the American ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva would be put to work immediately to extend Israel's participation there. If the Israelis faltered now, they were told, a window provided by the Dutch as chairman of WEOG in New York could close because of some unforeseen event in the Middle East or Europe.</p>
        <p>Two days later, Peter van Walsum, the Dutch ambassador, told his fellow WEOG members by letter that he was making the offer to Israel and they had until Friday to object. There were no objections.</p>
