        <p>In a freshly painted warehouse on a quiet street in Long Island City, Queens, one recent spring evening, passersby could glimpse an odd assortment of recognizable faces. Chuck Close was hobnobbing with Michael Ovitz. Ileana Sonnabend, the octogenarian gallery owner, was there along with the soprano Renee Fleming, Mike Wallace of ''60 Minutes,'' the art critic Robert Hughes, the singer and former Talking Head David Byrne, the choreographer Merce Cunningham, the curator Walter Hopps, Martha Stewart, the designer Edwin Schlossberg and Mathilde Krim, the founding chairwoman of the American Foundation for AIDS Research.</p>
        <p>The host was easy to spot. Clad in a cream-colored linen suit, Robert Rauschenberg, the 75-year-old artist, was boisterously greeting his guests. Some were old friends, he said; others he had never met before.</p>
        <p>''These people aren't friends or allies or conspirators or comforters,'' said Mr. Rauschenberg. ''They are a group of people picked for their diverse interests.'' At the artist's side was his dealer, Arne Glimcher, who is chairman of the PaceWildenstein Gallery, along with Maxwell L. Anderson, director of the Whitney Museum of American Art. Also present were Leonard A. Lauder, the Whitney's chairman, and Marla Prather, the museum's curator of postwar art.</p>
        <p>The guests had been invited to take part in what Mr. Rauschenberg called a game of visual gambling. But the setting looked more like a dinner party than a casino, what with a jazz duo playing in the background, a bar, a buffet and tables decorated with vases of peonies. Lining the walls of the warehouse were 52 panels, each nine and a half feet high but varying in width. All were adorned with hand-painted passages as well as Mr. Rauschenberg's familiar photographic images: everything from a Coca-Cola bottle to a fire hydrant to an automobile tire.</p>
        <p>Together, the panels form ''Synapsis Shuffle,'' the artist's latest work, which extends more than 220 feet and is his biggest after ''The 1/4 Mile or 2 Furlong Piece,'' a work in progress that, at last count, was made up of 206 panels.</p>
        <p>Like a deck of cards, the panels of ''Synapsis Shuffle'' are meant to be assembled by a different group of people every time they are shown so the work will never be seen the same way twice. The 12 guests were the first to create a version of ''Synapsis Shuffle'' for an exhibition opening at the Whitney on June 29.</p>
        <p>''Part of the exercise,'' Mr. Rauschenberg said, is to ''share the decisions artists have to make themselves when creating a work of art.''</p>
        <p>''But the piece is really about the element of chance,'' he added. ''At first I thought we should ask the first 12 taxi drivers who passed the museum to put panels together. Instead, we chose people with diverse interests to encourage as much controversy as possible. Even though everyone can trade panels like baseball cards, the evening may end in a fistfight. I guess this is bringing out the devil in me.''</p>
        <p>''Synapsis Shuffle'' took a year to complete, and Mr. Rauschenberg said he envisioned that it would end up in a number of different collections. That is, until Mr. Glimcher approached the Whitney, hoping the museum might purchase the entire work. Mr. Glimcher, Mr. Lauder and Ms. Prather traveled to Mr. Rauschenberg's studio in Captiva Island, Fla., where they tried to put together ''Synapsis Shuffle'' themselves. By the end of the visit, Mr. Lauder had agreed to buy the work, which experts say is worth $9 million to $10 million. He has made it a promised gift to the Whitney.</p>
        <p>''Walking into Bob's studio was like walking into a fairyland,'' Mr. Lauder recalled. ''Lined up on the walls were 52 individual masterpieces. I felt it was vital for the museum to have something like this.''</p>
        <p>As soon as all the guests had been given a chance to study the panels, Ms. Prather announced the rules of the evening: In order to produce 12 compositions from the 52 panels in a way that was fair to everyone, the participants -- in alphabetical order -- drew a series of numbered tags from a silver hat belonging to Mr. Rauschenberg; the numbers drawn indicated how many panels each person could work with -- from three to seven -- and in what order each would choose panels.</p>
        <p>While most of the participants were visibly anxious about what numbers they would pick, Ms. Sonnabend was not, having plotted her strategy well in advance. ''I'm going to choose the panels that are left over,'' she said. ''For years after a show I'd always buy what nobody else wanted. They were always the most difficult pieces, but in the end they became the strongest.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ovitz was intent on putting together as coherent a composition as possible. The first panel he chose had a blank canvas propped on an easel on its top portion and the image of a closed, shuttered door below. ''I love the concept of the blank easel,'' he said. ''Now the problem is to find something to go with it.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Rauschenberg predicted, bartering was inevitable. Mr. Wallace wanted one of Mr. Close's panels because the composition worked especially well with another he had selected. After considerable haggling the two cut a deal: Mr. Close agreed to relinquish one of his panels to Mr. Wallace if he would promise in writing that Morley Safer would not be allowed to do any more art segments on ''60 Minutes'' or ''CBS News Sunday Morning.'' A sheet of paper was produced, and the agreement was drawn up and signed. Only then was the desired panel turned over to Mr. Wallace.</p>
        <p>Many of the participants had strong ideas about how they wanted their works to look. Dr. Krim, for example, chose two of her allotted three panels because she said they were colorful and full of life: the images included a crowd scene, a crowded bus and a field of flowers. But somewhere in her composition she wanted to show desolation and emptiness to symbolize the devastation of AIDS. With Mr. Rauschenberg's permission, she simply turned the panel she liked least backward, so that it faced the wall. The back of the canvas, with its metal stretchers, resembled a ladder, and Mr. Glimcher pointed out that her composition was similar to a 1959 painting by Mr. Rauschenberg called ''Winter Pool,'' which incorporates a ladder between two panels.</p>
        <p>Dr. Krim wasn't the only person with a mind of her own. Once she had selected her allotted four panels, Ms. Fleming decided they looked best turned horizontally rather than vertically. She asked Mr. Rauschenberg's permission. Again it was granted.</p>
        <p>Others made an effort to create compositions that were in keeping with the artist's spirit. Mr. Byrne asked if he could use the silver hat in his composition. ''It's a Bob thing,'' he said referring to the artist's use of found objects.</p>
        <p>One of the quietest participants was Mr. Cunningham. He made his selections in much the same way he said he has choreographed his dances for the last 40 years: by tossing a set of eight-sided dice he found in a notions store in Minneapolis.</p>
        <p>''I always take them with me when I'm on tour,'' Mr. Cunningham said. ''Like the I Ching, I make a number of separate maneuvers using this chance operation. It's a game, but it's a wonderful game. Like a gambler I accept whatever comes up.'' But the four panels in his effort -- with imagery ranging from an Indian in full headdress to a lily pond -- seemed to belong together in terms of their color scheme and composition.</p>
        <p>When ''Synapsis Shuffle'' is assembled at the Whitney -- the museum is devoting the entire second floor to showing it -- labels will credit each person's composition. When it comes down on Oct. 8, it will be lent to other museums. Each time it is, it will be assembled by a different group of people invited by the artist.</p>
        <p>When the evening wound down and all the participants had finished assembling their panels, Mr. Rauschenberg seemed pleased with the outcome. Several days later he was uncharacteristically coy when asked to critique the group's work, saying simply that ''some did better than others.''</p>
        <p>He did add, however, that one day ''Synapsis Shuffle'' would enable him to play out one of his greatest fantasies: ''to walk into someone's home or into a museum and be able to say, 'Gosh, that's the worst Rauschenberg I've ever seen.'''</p>
