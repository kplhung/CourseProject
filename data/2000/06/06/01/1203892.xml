        <p>Will Eddie Belfour still be dazed and confused? That is the main question facing the Dallas Stars when they play Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals Thursday night.</p>
        <p>Belfour allowed six goals on only 18 shots before he was pulled early in the third period of an embarrassing 7-3 loss to the Devils Tuesday night in Game 1 at Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>The moody goaltender complained afterward that he was taking a decongestant and had experienced problems with ''balance and equilibrium'' during the game.</p>
        <p>''I've been told to get off it,'' Belfour said today, when asked if he was still taking the prescribed medication.</p>
        <p>As the goaltender who anchored the Stars to the Stanley Cup championship last season and through the playoffs this season, Belfour is by far the team's most important player. Coach Ken Hitchcock confirmed that.</p>
        <p>''I think what we learned last night is this: When Ed Belfour is average or even below average, we are not a very good team,'' Hitchcock said. ''I think we need Eddie to be a great player. But it also shows me how valuable this guy has been to our group. We have made the same mistakes in other games and he saved our bacon. Last night, for the first time maybe, he didn't do those things.''</p>
        <p>But, because Belfour, who still looked a little woozy today, came out and blamed his poor performance on cold medication, it is inevitable that some people will accuse the sometimes irascible goalie of making up an excuse.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't an excuse; it was the truth,'' Hitchcock said. ''But sometimes when Belfour says something, everybody thinks it's an excuse.''</p>
        <p>After participating in an optional off-day skate today, Belfour said: ''I don't like to use things like that as an excuse. I didn't play my best game. I didn't have a lot of energy today. But it was a chance to get a good sweat. And regardless of how I feel tomorrow, I have to find a way to play my best game. I've played with something like this before. Regardless, you have to find a way to win, no matter how you feel out there.''</p>
        <p>Hitchcock was asked why Belfour was even playing while taking a decongestant that made the goalie feel off balance.</p>
        <p>How could he be expected to face 100 mile-an-hour pucks?</p>
        <p>''Look,'' Hitchcock said, ''he is the horse that has gotten us this far, and we are going to ride him all the way through.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>Defenseman DERIAN HATCHER, the Stars' captain, said he felt confident he would play in Game 2 despite injuring his right leg late in Game 1 during a knee-on-knee collision with the Devils' ALEXANDER MOGILNY. ''I would almost guarantee I'll play,'' he said.'' But Coach KEN HITCHCOCK was not quite as optimistic. When asked if Hatcher would play, Hitchcock said, ''This year, yeah.'' Meanwhile, JAMIE LANGENBRUNNER, who was injured in Game 5 of the conference finals against Colorado, will not be back until at least Game 3 of this series.</p>
