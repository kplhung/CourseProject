        <p>THE paying guests are about to arrive, and Michael Henry Adams, a Harlem private-tour impresario, is bustling around his apartment, lighting candles atop a fireplace mantel and laying out tea in a porcelain pot and smoked salmon on a silver-plated platter.</p>
        <p>His own basement apartment, assembled since March but looking as if it had been that way since the Harlem Renaissance, leads off his $100 tour, which, on any given night, might include St. Nick's Pub or the Lenox Lounge. Most tours benefit some group. Who benefits from this one? ''Me,'' Mr. Adams said.</p>
        <p>He is certainly qualified to lead a tour: this spring, he taught a course called ''The Harlem Community'' at City College. At the end of the year, Monacelli Press is bringing out his architectural compendium, ''Harlem: Lost and Found: 1765-1915.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Adams once wanted to be an interior designer; his last apartment, a tiny studio room in Hamilton Heights, was featured in a book on New York style. His current three-room apartment on 122nd Street off Lenox Avenue (which he rents for $800 a month) is an exotic tossed salad, with Louis XVI and a crystal chandelier mixed up with street finds. His front room is an intimate parlor. There is no bedroom; his daybed sits in a niche on one wall in the back room.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adams is an avid preservationist, and his apartment is a prism through which the tourist can glimpse bits and pieces of Harlem past.</p>
        <p>Over his bed, for instance, is a galvanized tin frieze. ''It came from the Marion Building at the corner of 125th Street and Lenox -- ripped out and thrown into a Dumpster,'' he said. Over his fireplace hangs a gilded garland, part of the demolished interior of the Audubon Theater, where Malcolm X was assassinated.</p>
        <p>His decorating with Harlem's lost-and-found objects makes sense. When he was 13, his father scoffed at his ambition to be an interior designer, telling him, ''Only white people hire interior designers.''</p>
        <p>In 1974, he went to the Addingham Summer School in England, and eventually studied historic preservation for two years at Columbia University. He gave up becoming an interior designer: too many people told him his father was right.</p>
        <p>Over the years, meanwhile, Mr. Adams developed a passion for preservation that some find abrasive.</p>
        <p>''Why would you say abrasive?'' he asked. ''I'd rather you say 'confrontational.' ''</p>
        <p>He is most confrontational when demanding landmark status for large chunks of Harlem. Usually, he speaks in a deliberate, low voice. But his voice rises when he talks about the historic buildings that have come down, and are coming down, in Harlem.</p>
        <p>''The Abyssinian Baptist Church is trying to turn Small's Paradise -- the only one of the three major jazz clubs, and the only one owned by a black man -- into an International House of Pancakes,'' he said. ''Would they turn the Stork Club into an International House of Pancakes?'' (Karen Phillips, president of the church's development corporation, confirmed that negotiations with the pancake chain are under way.)</p>
        <p>The best way to protect such unofficial landmarks, Mr. Adams said, is to incorporate them into a series of historic districts, and until that happens, he will continue to protest.</p>
        <p>Although the city landmarks commission has designated the Hotel Teresa, the Mother Zion A.M.E. Church, the Abyssinian Baptist Church, Wadleigh High School and dozens of other Harlem buildings during the last decade, Mr. Adams contends that thousands more need protection, among them the newly restored Lenox Lounge, the Renaissance Casino, Blumstein's Department Store and 321 Edgecombe Avenue, where the Mills Brothers and the Nicholas Brothers lived. ''Almost all of Greenwich Village, much of the Upper East Side and Upper West Side and most of Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights are landmarked,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A commission spokeswoman, Terri Rosen Deutsch, rejected Mr. Adams's criticisms. The current commission, she said, has done more in Harlem in the last five years than any other commission.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adams said that after the panel voted to protect some buildings -- but not to create an entirely new district -- one commissioner asked if he was grateful. He says he is far from grateful. To prove it, he chained himself to the doors of commission headquarters in Manhattan last year. He spent a night in jail.</p>
        <p>Some preservationists may be wary of Mr. Adams because of such stunts, but Anthony C. Wood, chairman emeritus of New York City's Historic Districts Council, says his voice is an important one in Harlem preservation. ''You can question the wisdom of his tactics, but you can't question his dedication,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Is Mr. Adams an outright zealot, or just zealous?</p>
        <p>''In our culture, to call someone a zealot is pejorative, but to call someone zealous is not,'' he replied. ''All I want is for Harlem to have the same degree of protection that the other historic neighborhoods have.''</p>
