        <p>Re ''Blighted Areas Are Revived as Crime Rate Falls in Cities'' (front page, May 29): The issue is not a drop in crime but a displacement of communities.</p>
        <p>Why should we celebrate the fact that historic sites of social struggle like the U Street neighborhood in Washington and Chicago's West Side are now sporting organic grocery stores and ''avant-garde galleries''? These new investors are interested only in raising property values to push out residents who cannot afford the rising rents.</p>

        <p>Re ''Blighted Areas Are Revived as Crime Rate Falls in Cities'' (front page, May 29): The issue is not a drop in crime but a displacement of communities.</p>
        <p>Why should we celebrate the fact that historic sites of social struggle like the U Street neighborhood in Washington and Chicago's West Side are now sporting organic grocery stores and ''avant-garde galleries''? These new investors are interested only in raising property values to push out residents who cannot afford the rising rents.</p>
        <p>The answer to urban decay is not to displace residents from their homes and shatter their communities, but to help them recover their neighborhoods for themselves. Your article describes the new residents as fearless pioneers, but does not mention whom these pioneers are driving out, nor where they're being driven.</p>
