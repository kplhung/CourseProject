        <p>Arthur Everett Austin Jr., or Chick, as he was known from childhood, managed to have the last word on himself, by getting the first one in.</p>
        <p>''The house is just like me,'' he told critics and admirers of the 86-foot-wide, one-room-deep, painted-wood Palladian villa with the Venetian Baroque and International style interiors. ''All facade.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Austin, director of the Wadsworth Atheneum, built the striking house here on staid Scarborough Street in 1930 at age 29.</p>
        <p>After 20 months and half a million dollars of cosmetic labor, the ''pasteboard palace,'' as local grandees dubbed it, will greet Hartford society again. The Atheneum, which now owns the Austin house and has restored it, will unveil it to trustees next Thursday, appropriately, at a party. A National Historic Landmark, it may eventually be on view by appointment.</p>
        <p>''I talked to the son of the man who lived across the street when Chick was building the house, who was one of the founders of the august Hartford law firm Robinson &amp; Cole,'' said Eugene R. Gaddis, the curator of the Austin house and his biographer. ''The son was in his mid-70's. 'What did your father think of the house?' I asked, and he said, 'An excrescence.' I said: 'Oh, well, that's very interesting. And what do you think of it, after all these years?' 'An excrescence,' he said.</p>
        <p>But Philip Johnson, who was introduced to Mr. Austin in the 1920's by Henry-Russell Hitchcock, the architectural historian, called the house more important now than even its designer could have understood.</p>
        <p>''Of course none of us could stand his house, heavens no,'' Mr. Johnson recalls in Mr. Gaddis's biography, ''Magician of the Modern,'' to be published by Alfred A. Knopf in the fall. ''The least we could do was copy Gropius. Today, every architect that I know under 45 wouldn't think of building a house without going through his books of Palladio first. And there it sits on Scarborough Street. A postmodern house, if you please.''</p>
        <p>Behind Mr. Austin's legendary chain-smoking, cocktail-swilling, brilliantined matinee-idol facade was the work of a serious avant-gardist.</p>
        <p>As the director from 1927 to 1945 of the Atheneum, America's oldest public art museum (established by Daniel Wadsworth in 1842), Mr. Austin mounted the first comprehensive Picasso exhibition in the United States. The evening the show opened, guests like Alexander Calder, Isamu Noguchi, Buckminster Fuller and Clare Booth Luce sat for the world premiere of Gertrude Stein and Virgil Thomson's first opera, ''Four Saints in Three Acts,'' in the theater of a Bauhaus-inspired building that was Mr. Austin's newest, personally designed addition to the museum, the Avery Memorial.</p>
        <p>The young director also staged the country's first Surrealist exhibition, featuring a Spaniard named Salvador Dali with a painting called ''Persistence of Memory.'' With a Harvard friend, Lincoln Kirstein, Mr. Austin sponsored the immigration of a dancer and choreographer named George Balanchine and gave his new company its first public appearance in America. At the Atheneum, he ran the first film retrospective at a museum. ''The Art of the Motion Picture'' opened with Fritz Lang's ''Metropolis.''</p>
        <p>Behind the facade of the Modernist was an old-world connoisseur of painting and sculpture, a curator and a collector. With his parents, Mr. Austin had been making trips to Europe since he was 3. He had lived in Dresden and Paris. He had studied with Bernard Berenson. Mr. Austin's exhibition of Italian Baroque art in 1934 is credited by scholars with rediscovering a period that had been dismissed for 100 years.</p>
        <p>And behind his academic facade was a bisexual adventurer who married a local socialite, Helen Goodwin, who happened to be the niece of the Atheneum's board president, had two children, sporadically pursued a second career in Hollywood away from his family, and was fired by the museum in 1945 in part because of uncovered financial chaos. For his next and last act, he brought a Florida circus millionaire's museum to international prominence, then died at home in Hartford in 1957, at 57, of an inoperable tumor, having abandoned his male lover of 10 years to return to his wife.</p>
        <p>Mr. Austin claimed he saw an angel before he slipped into a coma. No one knows whether it was shaking its head.</p>
        <p>Behind the pilastered facade on Scarborough Street, he had nothing to hide. Mr. Austin liked to show his house, bringing the curtain up with a flourish on its stagelike, set-piece rooms. A devotee of drama who designed several theaters and play productions, including ''Medea'' in 1934, directed by John Houseman, translated by the Harlem poet Countee Cullen and choreographed by Martha Graham, Mr. Austin also appeared in Hartford as Hamlet, challenging the loyalty of even good friends.</p>
        <p>The two-story, 18-foot-deep house involved every aspect of the dilettante's interests, training and talents (he called himself an ''amateur,'' in the 18th-century sense), including a gift for magic. Mr. Austin toured publicly as the Great Osram, a name taken from the German light fixtures used in his new Bauhaus-inspired bathrooms.</p>
        <p>The house's exterior was based on the Villa Ferreti in Dolo, Italy, built in 1596 by Vincenzo Scamozzi, a student (later a rival) of Andrea Palladio. The Austins saw it on their honeymoon.</p>
        <p>The interiors were an artistic showman's display of his two great aesthetic loves: the Baroque and the Modern. ''Part of being a Modernist, in Chick's view, was rediscovering the past,'' Mr. Gaddis said on a recent visit, standing in the dining room, which is in the style of the Baroque. The walls are covered in a blue-green brocatelle silk recreated by Scalamandre from scraps of the original that the Austins bought in Venice. ''It created a dramatic world for his own very Modernist existence. You go from this very 18th-century atmosphere downstairs to the very edge of design in the Bauhaus, upstairs. For Chick, all art was contemporary. If you understood how it was created and why it was created, it was alive.''</p>
        <p>The house cost $43,000 to build. Mr. Austin's adoring mother, Laura, paid for it. She spent her life constructing an elaborate genealogy to prove that she and her son were royalty. After four years of dunning letters from Adolf Loewi, his Venetian antiques dealer, for a payment of $15,000, which was four times Mr. Austin's salary, the furnishing bills were sent to her, too.</p>
        <p>THE house is a precociously educated pastiche. In addition to studying with Berenson in Italy, Mr. Austin was also a student of Federigo Ioni, a notorious restorer who was also reputed to be a forger, copying 15th-century pictures as exercises.</p>
        <p>In the dining room, the carved cobweb-like boiserie that frames the serving niche is in fact a Bavarian bed alcove. The grand doorway that leads into the living room is  taken from a massive armoire. The harbor tableaux of fantastic voyages with pantalooned buccaneers that form its views are the output of ''a third-rate journeyman simulating a painting by Claude Lorrain, which hangs in the Louvre,'' Mr. Gaddis said.</p>
        <p>''It's more or less wallpaper,'' he explained. ''Chick started to enlarge the boat in one panel, then gave up on it. So you see, this is not the grand Newport kind of a finished palace. It's Chick's stage set. Many things are not of the highest quality, but he didn't care. He wanted the aura.''</p>
        <p>He was also, in the tradition of the theater and the studio arts, a do-it-yourselfer.</p>
        <p>There were only four walls for the five 18th-century Italian chinoiserie painted-silk panels in the music room. Mr. Austin installed the extra one on the ceiling. In 1935, Virgil Thomson, Aaron Copland, Paul Bowles and George Antheil sat here and played at the piano until 4 in the morning.</p>
        <p>Mr. Austin marbleized and trompe-l'oeiled steps, mirror frames and door surrounds. He mixed the house's 56 interior colors himself.</p>
        <p>''That's the extraordinary thing,'' Mr. Gaddis said, ''the fact that you have this house from a great connoisseur of fine arts that was created by him personally.'' Mr. Austin was an assistant to Edward Forbes, the director of the the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Mass., for three years before Mr. Forbes recommended the young man for the job in Hartford.</p>
        <p>''He was trained in the methods and processes of Italian Renaissance painting,'' Mr. Gaddis said, ''and he knew how colors were created and what they did, from an artist's point of view. This house was a painting to him.''</p>
        <p>Krystyn Hastings-Silver, the project manager for the restoration, said that when carpeting was pulled up for replacement, ''the floors looked like Jackson Pollocks -- he mixed the colors for each room right there in the room.'' Colors were frequently pulled from artwork: the living room's dark green copies the storm-clouded skies in the 18th-century harbor scenes.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hastings-Silver also found valuable wall fabric samples, which she used to match for color with replicas, under baseboards that Mr. Austin had tacked on.</p>
        <p>''You could follow the line of his scissors as he cut along the wall,'' she said. ''A professional tradesman wouldn't have left this kind of evidence.''</p>
        <p>Because of its conceit as a backdrop, the uneven quality of its furniture and Mr. Austin's attention to decoration, the house's backgrounds were treated as its most important historical elements, from the rose silk taffeta draperies in the living room to the flat planes of paint in Helen Austin's dressing room and bathroom upstairs, which were based on Walter Gropius's bathroom at the Bauhaus in Dessau. In it, each section of every wall is coordinated by color to its exposure: east-facing surfaces are beige, west are blue, north are cream and south are a deep cocoa brown.</p>
        <p>''This was the first room the painters did,'' Ms. Hastings-Silver said of her team, which included more than 30 trades, ''and we're so glad they didn't quit.''</p>
        <p>The house was given to the Atheneum by the Austin family in 1985, when Helen Austin, then in ill health, moved out. With a bequest from her cousin Genevieve Harlow Goodwin, the museum started its investigations of the house, ''a place of odd enchantments,'' as Mr. Gaddis describes it.</p>
        <p>Brought back, waiting for its next role, it seems more a restoration of a remarkable spirit, with remarkable taste and a remarkable irresponsibility to the truth, than the reconstruction of historic rooms in an architecturally significant building.</p>
        <p>Fired pink and gold by late afternoon sunlight, the Austin house showed what it knew of its creator: every incautious corner of it grew warm with seduction, never missing a trick.</p>
