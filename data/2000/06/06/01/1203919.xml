        <p>The New York State health commissioner yesterday suspended the licenses of two doctors who provided government-financed breast cancer screenings to poor women, calling their practice an ''imminent danger to public health.''</p>
        <p>The commissioner, Dr. Antonia C. Novello, charged that the doctors, Steven J. Bier and Mario DiBlasio, both radiologists, who screened 9,000 to 11,000 women in the Bronx for breast cancer in the last five years, failed to provide accurate diagnostic tests and often billed for tests they did not provide.</p>
        <p>The State Health Department, which has accused the doctors of gross negligence and incompetence, said that it would try to find the doctors' patients and retest them at state expense.</p>
        <p>Dr. Novello said nearly all the patients thought they were cancer-free, though the exams were at best inconclusive. She said the doctors failed to adjust mammogram machines, properly position patients, process films correctly, and in some cases, provide breast exams at all. The doctors reported their results and billed the state roughly $1 million in five years, the department found.</p>
        <p>''The danger is that we may have women out there with undiagnosed breast cancer,'' Dr. Novello said.</p>
        <p>The suspensions, the latest in a series of disciplinary actions by the department against doctors and health care centers in the last year, underscore the increasing difficulty faced by New York State's large uninsured population in finding high-quality primary care. The actions also reinforce Dr. Novello's campaign to publicize what she and her investigators believe are negligent medical practices.</p>
        <p>The lapses in care were discovered, Dr. Novello said, through a monitoring technique recently adapted by the state to look at the quality of breast cancer detection. By comparing the results submitted by Dr. Bier and Dr. DiBlasio with those of other doctors, the state found that the two doctors reported abnormal breast-exam results at a rate 24 times lower than the state average.</p>
        <p>Further, while 5.15 per 1,000 breast cancer screenings in New York State detect cancer, Dr. Bier's office detected 1.25 per 1,000. Breast cancer kills 3,700 women in New York State each year.</p>
        <p>After looking at the data, the Health Department then conducted a telephone survey of 50 women who had breast exams by Dr. Bier, finding that most thought they had received poor care, according to the report. Further investigations showed that the doctors often performed inadequate tests or did not provide the service they billed for. For instance, many times the doctors reported that they had taught patients how to do home breast exams but had not, the report said. Dr. Bier hired Dr. DiBlasio to provide radiology services through Dr. Bier's corporation, according to the state's report.</p>
        <p>Both doctors had their licenses suspended pending a final investigation and hearing. The move is unusual, reserved for doctors who the state believes are a danger to patients if allowed to practice while awaiting the outcome of the state's case, a process that can take months or years.</p>
        <p>A woman answering the phone at Dr. Bier's office, at 2488 Grand Concourse in the Fordham section, said in several efforts to reach him that he was not available and hung up. There is no business or home listing for Dr. DiBlasio in New York State. Dr. DiBlasio was disciplined by the state in the 1980's for a drug-related offense that did not involve patients.</p>
        <p>The State Health Department has already sent letters to 9,000 women in the Bronx who were believed to have had tests in the offices of the doctors, whose practice was connected to the Healthy Women Partnership, a breast and cervical cancer screening program for uninsured and poor women that is paid for by the state and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since the program began in 1988, more than 250,000 women have been screened.</p>
        <p>The state will provide new free tests to the women through various hospitals in the Bronx, as well as  MetroCards to get them to their appointments, at a cost of roughly $500,000. The department will also telephone women who do not respond to letters.</p>
        <p>Dr. Novello has held news conferences each time she takes disciplinary actions against doctors or hospitals, which has been quite frequently. In March, she rebuked Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, fining the center $58,000 and citing it for 29 violations for covering up a botched surgery in which a healthy kidney was removed from a 79-year-old patient who later died.</p>
        <p>Earlier, the agency cited Staten Island University Hospital for 40 violations and fined it $80,000 for failing to monitor and discipline its chief of neurosurgery, whom the state charged with various serious surgical errors.</p>
