        <p>Re ''Japan's Employers Are Giving Bonuses for Having Babies'' (front page, May 30): Japan is slightly smaller than California, yet its population is nearly four times as large. Its mountainous terrain leaves little room for agriculture. Its natural resources are meager.</p>
        <p>To fill shortages, Japan has become the world's biggest importer of lumber, depleting the world's forests. Japan has overfished its local waters and is fishing ever further from its shores, putting more pressure on wild fish stocks worldwide.</p>

        <p>Re ''Japan's Employers Are Giving Bonuses for Having Babies'' (front page, May 30): Japan is slightly smaller than California, yet its population is nearly four times as large. Its mountainous terrain leaves little room for agriculture. Its natural resources are meager.</p>
        <p>To fill shortages, Japan has become the world's biggest importer of lumber, depleting the world's forests. Japan has overfished its local waters and is fishing ever further from its shores, putting more pressure on wild fish stocks worldwide.</p>
        <p>The Japanese have the world's longest life expectancy, and they worry that they will not have enough young people in the future for their work force. The answer is technology, not more babies. If there is a work-force shortfall, there are more than enough workers elsewhere in the world they can employ.</p>
