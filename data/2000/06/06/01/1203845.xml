        <p>It started in the early years of the 20th century, when the Cubists broke down their subject matter in ways that resembled African masks. Later Surrealists, Expressionists and even Pop artists took visual ideas and concepts from Africa. Now contemporary African artists are appropriating their traditions themselves.</p>
        <p>That is the raison d'etre for the fifth Dak'Art, Senegal's Pan-African biennial of art, being held here through Monday. This former French colony, which the United Nations counts among the world's least developed nations, has diverted almost $1 million from basic human services and from paying off its vast foreign debt to bring 47 artists here from 18 African countries and critics and curators from around the world.</p>
        <p>''Development is not just about having enough to eat,'' said Remi Sagna, director of Dak'Art, which has taken over museums and public spaces throughout the capital. ''We are making a long-term investment in our culture.''</p>
        <p>The dividend, as he sees it, is twofold. ''Art projects more complex images of who we are than the conflict and misery shown in the international press,'' he said. The other benefit is money: ''If African artists could command high prices, it would be a boom to our economies.''</p>
        <p>Not that the artworks are all an easy sell. Many of the works on view here are highly conceptual. In a simple, elegant installation a Senegalese artist, Soly Cisse, drapes mosquito netting, weighed down by pillows, from a wall. Samuel Fosso, a photographer from the Central African Republic, presents studio portraits of himself in often unflattering outfits. The Ghanaian photographer Essien Mfon presents images of imperfect naked African bodies.</p>
        <p>''Dak'Art is not meant to be a postcard vision of Africa,'' said Jean-Charles Tall, an architect who is a member of the biennial's organizing committee. ''It is a serious attempt by Africans to reflect life through art.''</p>
        <p>Representation in African art has always been largely symbolic. Giving cultural meaning to found objects, as the European Dadaists did in the 1910's, or to raw materials, as Arte Povera did in Italy in the 1960's, is the kind of leap of faith common in African spiritual practices.</p>
        <p>But ''for Westerners, modern art is a revolt against the past,'' said the spokesman for Dak'Art, Oussanou Gueye. ''Africans don't generally have these complexes.''</p>
        <p>Still, African intellectuals have long been trying to figure out how their connection to Western modernism could be of benefit to Africans in the real world. One of the earliest was Leopold Senghor, Senegal's poet and first president, who lived in Paris in the early 20th century and associated with artists there. When Picasso once told him, ''We must remain savages,'' he replied, ''We must remain Negroes.''</p>
        <p>In the 1930's Mr. Senghor became a leading member of the Negritude movement, a heady group of French-speaking black writers affirming traditional African culture and values and rejecting the French policy of assimilation. He proclaimed that in the postcolonial world order Africans would be the artists because ''emotion is African,'' while ''reason is Hellenic.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Senghor was elected president upon Senegal's independence in 1960, he built schools for the arts, a grand concert hall, and the Musee Dynamique for contemporary art. Senegalese schoolchildren in the farthest-flung villages were taught African history and culture as well as modernist art and theory. With generous government support for the arts, many became artists.</p>
        <p>They produced thousands of rectangular semiabstract paintings with colorful brush strokes that were painfully imitative and repetitive. None of the artists became famous in the West, or even in Senegal. When the technocrat Abdou Diouf became president in 1980, support for the arts dried up, and the Musee Dynamique was emptied of its artworks and turned into the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Hopes for an African ''modern'' art seemed all but dashed. ''African culture is only a raw material for the West,'' said an official who worked at the Ministry of Culture at the time. ''It's like cocoa, which grows in Africa, but when you try to make chocolate from it here it melts. And that's what happened to Senegal's dream.''</p>
        <p>With the first biennial in 1993, a spark again flickered, with a difference. The artists and critics to emerge do not have the utopian vision of Mr. Senghor's generation. ''They are less concerned about being rooted in their culture,'' Mr. Gueye said of the Senegalese artists in this year's Dak'Art.</p>
        <p>He gave the example of a sculpture by Ndary Lo consisting of a giant iron stick figure wrapped in white thread in such a way that it looks like a  traditionally Senegalese long white gown. ''For me the contrast of luxurious cloth against junk metal resonates with the way toughness and refinement sit side by side in Senegal,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Dak'Art grand prix is named after Mr. Senghor, and his legacy continues. Some Senegalese artists not included in the official biennial have built an ''art village'' of mud-and-straw huts next to the city's giant stadium (also named after Mr. Senghor), where they say they are creating a more authentic modern African art. They call their exhibition ''Dak'Art Off.''</p>
        <p>The biennial doesn't seem to have an overall philosophy other than including as many different types of contemporary visual culture as possible. Since 1998 the biennials have included sections for fabric makers and furniture designers.</p>
        <p>''We no longer believe in trying to distinguish between high and low culture in Africa,'' Mr. Sagna said. ''One way or another all art is functional, and there is nothing wrong with it's being popular.''</p>
        <p>Certainly the work does not have to look ''African.'' The most successful Senegalese artist in recent years, Ousmane Sow, a member of the show's organizing committee, is a realist sculptor whose installations resemble theme parks; the  themes are not always related to Africa. One of his installations, shown last year in Paris, tells the story of the Battle of Little Big Horn.</p>
        <p>This year's Dak'Art will be seen in the West for the first time. It is to travel to France later this year, and organizers are trying to persuade curators at the Studio Museum in Harlem to bring it to the United States.</p>
