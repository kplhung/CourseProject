        <p>They claimed a sense of urgency, not a feeling of panic. As Glen Rice and A. C. Green engaged in a loose post-practice shooting drill and teammates casually heaved half-court shots around them, the Lakers gave the impression today that their Game 5 freeze had already thawed.</p>
        <p>Green and Rice took turns running at each other while shooting jump shots in an effort to simulate the Portland defense that suddenly became nasty during the Trail Blazers' 96-88 victory in Game 5 on Tuesday night. Despite playing at home, the Lakers had their lead cut to three games to two in the four-of-seven-game Western Conference finals.</p>
        <p>Rice, Robert Horry and Kobe Bryant in particular were harassed in Game 5 and missed a combined 24 of 32 shots. Coming off 21 points on 7-of-11 shooting Sunday, Rice was 1 of 8 Tuesday night. Horry was 3 of 11. Bryant, who played on a right foot sprained in the first quarter and who battled foul trouble throughout, was 4 of 13.</p>
        <p>But in a series of wild momentum swings and two victories by each team on the other's home court, the Lakers did not seem concerned about shots not falling Friday night at the Rose Garden.</p>
        <p>Bryant shook off his cold hand and tender foot and pronounced himself fit for Game 6 in Portland. Rice shrugged off his inaccuracies, saying the ball sometimes just doesn't go in the basket. Horry, who has made only 8 of 24 attempts in the last four games, believed the Lakers spent too much time forcing 3-point shots; they tried 27, but made only 6.</p>
        <p>''It had a lot to do with Portland's defense,'' Rice said. ''They didn't allow us to get in our offense as easily as we did in previous games.''</p>
        <p>Shaquille O'Neal said: ''We were so anxious to put this team away, we didn't take care of our business properly. We're going to be fine.''</p>
        <p>Lakers Coach Phil Jackson attributed the loss to little mistakes magnified by the Trail Blazers' aggressive play and their desperation not to be eliminated. He pointed to the third quarter, when the Lakers shot 60 percent and Portland's 8-point halftime lead grew to 13 points heading into the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Jackson offered at least one excuse for his team's overall 38 percent shooting.</p>
        <p>Before Game 5, Jackson held the Lakers' shoot-around at their training facility in El Segundo near Los Angeles International Airport, before going downtown to the Staples Center.</p>
        <p>''Little stuff like that,'' Jackson said. ''Portland looked more comfortable on our court than we did.''</p>
        <p>The Trail Blazers were more determined from the start.</p>
        <p>Led by 22 points each from Scottie Pippen and Rasheed Wallace, Portland dictated a pace that was fast and physical. The Lakers never adjusted, especially to Pippen, who was quicker afoot and lighter in the wallet for Game 5.</p>
        <p>Pippen had been fined $10,000 by the National Basketball Association for his forearm to the back of John Salley's head with 52 seconds left in Game 4, an incident that Jackson complained should have resulted in a one-game suspension. Despite dislocating two fingers in the first quarter Tuesday night, Pippen also delivered six rebounds, six steals and four blocked shots.</p>
        <p>''We know in our hearts we can outplay this team,'' Pippen said. ''We have throughout this series, but we haven't completed it in the games. We feel like we're going to outplay them every time out on the court.''</p>
        <p>With a victory Friday night at Portland, the Lakers can advance to the N.B.A. finals for the first time since 1991, when they lost to the Chicago Bulls.</p>
        <p>Should the Trail Blazers win, Game 7 will be Sunday at the Staples Center.</p>
        <p>''It was almost surreal,'' Derek Fisher said about losing Game 5. ''We have to stop this right now. The longer this series goes, the worse our chances.''</p>
        <p>Rice said: ''They have a little more life. It's 3 to 2. They have everything to be confident about. But so do we. They know they haven't beaten us up there yet in this series.''</p>
