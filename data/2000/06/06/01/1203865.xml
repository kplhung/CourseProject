        <p>It was not just another company, another show. The return of the Bolshoi Ballet from Moscow for its first United States tour in 10 years fills a gap for American audiences that has been sorely felt.</p>
        <p>No other foreign ballet company had the explosive impact on the West that Bolshoi did when it first appeared in London in 1956 and in New York in 1959.</p>
        <p>The troupe has certainly had its ups and downs over the decades. But the Bolshoi has never lost the effect of the initial images it impressed upon the eye. Here was power in technique, dramatic projection and even choreographic novelty. Every American ballerina held aloft in an overhead lift by her partner owes something to the Bolshoi, as does the cascade of ballets throughout the world that are set to Prokofiev's ''Romeo and Juliet.''</p>
        <p>There is nonetheless only one landmark version of the Prokofiev score, and it is the version by Leonid Lavrovsky with which the Bolshoi opened on Tuesday night at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts here.</p>
        <p>It is a magnificent ballet, a museum piece of extraordinary dimension that is couched in a style of dramatic realism that is very difficult for contemporary dancers to capture. In a somewhat diluted version, it was the surprise hit of the Kirov Ballet's 1992 season at the Metropolitan Opera House. Then as on Tuesday, the ballet was led by Nina Ananiashvili, a guest with the Kirov, and now even more of a poignant Juliet with a Bolshoi Romeo, the noble Andrei Uvarov.</p>
        <p>Prokofiev wrote his now overly popular score (heard on one American television commercial too many) for the ''Romeo and Juliet'' that Lavrovsky choreographed in 1940 for the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad. When Lavrovsky and his legendary Juliet, Galina Ulanova, transferred to Moscow after World War II, he restaged the ballet with some changes in 1946. It is with this Bolshoi version that the company made its historic debut in New York in 1959.</p>
        <p>It was a stupefying production (also seen on film with Ulanova) that initially left critics and audience stunned, sometimes baffled. Above all, it was an exercise in Stanislavsky-type realism, with each dancer, down to every beggar in Verona, motivated by meaning in gesture. What looked like silent acting was a flow of dance and modern mime that was direct rather than symbolic.</p>
        <p>In tune with Soviet times, Lavrovsky cast ''Romeo and Juliet'' as a class drama: a bold and sprawling picture of the people contrasted with haughty aristocrats who crushed the human spirit.</p>
        <p>The Soviet dance historian Yuri Slonimsky saw Lavrovsky's theme as ''the unequal struggle waged by the children of tomorrow against the injustice of yesterday.'' Lavrovsky, however, never lost sight of the love story while placing it in an interpretive social context. And unlike the later Western versions that he himself spawned, his ''Romeo and Juliet'' reconciled the Capulets and Montagues at the end, thus remaining true to Shakespeare.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Kirov revival, the current Bolshoi version does not turn its aristocrats into cartoons. Andrei Sitnikov is not an exaggerated Lord Capulet but rather an autocratic patriarch enraged by his daughter's refusal to marry Paris. After she has taken her potion and he thinks she is dead, his pain, hand to heart, is telegraphed with intensity and depth.</p>
        <p>The Kirov's Paris was vain but Alexei Barsegyan, as a strong-willed but uncomprehending youth, merely looked into a mirror held by his page and did not preen. Similarly, when Lavrovsky has Tybalt kick a peddler, the scene is part of a social fabric not a vicious image for its own sake.</p>
        <p>The Bolshoi has brought along the famous checkerboard floor that the Kirov omitted and that is such a striking part of the sets and costumes by Pyotr Williams. Williams  was a major Russian designer, and the Renaissance luxury he created for the Leningrad and Moscow productions is felt especially in his ballroom scene in Act I and the richly patterned drapes of Juliet's bedroom in Act III, which precedes the epilogue and its reconciliation of the clans.</p>
        <p>But the opera house stage at the Kennedy Center is too small to give full justice to the pictorial power of this ''Romeo,'' which is to be repeated with other casts on Saturday afternoon and evening. ''Don Quixote,'' in a new production by Alexei Fadeyechev, the Bolshoi Ballet's artistic director since 1998, will also be performed on this five-city tour presented by the Kennedy Center with David Eden productions: ''Don Quixote,'' led by Ms. Ananiashvili on Thursday night, will be repeated Friday night and Sunday afternoon.</p>
        <p>The creased look of the old scenery in the beginning could be eliminated with better lighting. But despite the cramped space, the animated crowd scenes with their wonderful folk-flavored dances in heels and boots gradually build up in the town square. The statues there differ from those in the Kirov version, focusing on David, slayer of Goliath. Another change has Juliet wearing a different cross around her neck with every formal gown, which Ulanova certainly did not.</p>
        <p>How much the ''Romeo and Juliet'' of Kenneth Macmillan (1965) and John Cranko (1963) owe to Lavrovsky's Capulet ball is obvious. The Bolshoi wall tapestry depicts a Lady Godiva and three goddesses with three golden apples. (In 1992 the Kirov had Europa on her bull.) Whatever the decor, the overall dramatic effect is stunning, opening on a banquet with Tybalt atop a table and lounging courtiers. This bacchanalian decadence is then channeled into the famous dance with the cushions. The Capulets advance, holding pillows, kneel on them and grab their partners in a passionate embrace.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ananiashvili and Mr. Uvarov, as well as Maria Alexandrova and Sergei Filin, who lead the classical divertissements at the ball and Act III, are outstanding dancers. Nikolai Tsiskaridze's charismatic Mercutio and Dmitri Belogovtsev's aptly hardened Tybalt rounded out a fine cast of principals. Yet they act like contemporary dancers everywhere, and Lavrovsky's ''Romeo and Juliet'' is very special. To move from position to position in a duet is not its style. It is a danced play that requires no break in style.</p>
        <p>To be touched by Ms. Ananiashvili's performance was easy: It is filled with intelligence and nuance, a Juliet who is overtaken by events and deeply in love. That she dominates the ballet, overshadowing her Romeo, is not a surprise.</p>
        <p>Alexander Kopylov conducted the Kennedy Center ochestra: it was too expensive to bring the Bolshoi's own to the tour, which includes Chicago (Tuesday through June 10), Seattle (June 14-18), Los Angeles (June 21-25) and Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, Calif. (June 27 to July 2).</p>
