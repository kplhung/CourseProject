        <p>Embrace of the Lespedeza</p>
        <p>Q. Two years ago, I planted two small bush clovers (Lespedeza thunbergii). Last summer, they grew well over six feet tall and produced gorgeous purple blossoms in August and September, drowning a rose bush next to them. This spring, all those branches are dead and new growth is coming up from the base. Will it be just as huge this summer? If so, should I move the rose bush or can I trim back the lespedeza?</p>
        <p>A. With any luck, your plants will indeed be just as large this year. Or maybe a bit larger. Other than that, expect the same performance. Whether it's too big a show for the rose depends on the rose and on your appetite for crawling around at the base of the lespedeza.</p>

        <p>Embrace of the Lespedeza</p>
        <p>Q. Two years ago, I planted two small bush clovers (Lespedeza thunbergii). Last summer, they grew well over six feet tall and produced gorgeous purple blossoms in August and September, drowning a rose bush next to them. This spring, all those branches are dead and new growth is coming up from the base. Will it be just as huge this summer? If so, should I move the rose bush or can I trim back the lespedeza?</p>
        <p>A. With any luck, your plants will indeed be just as large this year. Or maybe a bit larger. Other than that, expect the same performance. Whether it's too big a show for the rose depends on the rose and on your appetite for crawling around at the base of the lespedeza.</p>
        <p>If the rose bush is small or prone to fungus, it should be moved. If it's medium to large, and robust, it probably won't suffer long-term harm from a late lespedeza embrace, especially if those loving arms are fewer than nature intended.</p>
        <p>In other words, the lespedezas should be thinned rather than trimmed. Remove up to a third of the shoots from each clump, cutting them off right at the base. If the cut shoots keep growing, cut them again. The less-dense lespedezas will still be tall and weep gracefully over their neighbor, but they'll be too light and lacy for any serious smothering.</p>
        <p>Speaking of which, the words bush clover can terrify anyone familiar with your plants' evil cousin, the highly invasive Chinese lespedeza (L. cuneata). L. thunbergii isn't worry-free, but it's usually less threatening to the surrounding countryside. It's also inclined to be more tender than generally advertised, though individual plants have survived as far north as Maine.</p>
        <p>L. thunbergii is available from Plant Delights Nursery, 9241 Sauls Road, Raleigh, N.C. 27603; (919) 772-4794. Catalog: 10 postage stamps or a box of chocolates. It's also available from Avant Gardens, 710 High Hill Road, North Dartmouth, Mass. 02747; (508) 998-8819. Catalog: $3, refundable with order.</p>
        <p>Mulch, Rain and Rot</p>
        <p>Q. Our vegetable garden in the upper Hudson Valley suffered badly in last summer's drought, so this year we mulched the lettuce and peas with straw as soon as they came up. We also put a thick layer of it around the peppers and tomatoes. But now we're afraid all the recent rain will lead to problems with rot. Should we take the mulch off again and allow the garden to dry out a bit?</p>
        <p>A. Think about straw mulch the way you're supposed to think of stock funds: Apply the money wisely, then leave it alone.</p>
        <p>Cool-weather crops like lettuce and peas should be mulched early. The insulating layer of straw will keep the soil around their roots nicely chilly. Hot-weather crops like tomatoes and peppers, on the other hand, don't like cold feet. They should not be mulched (or ideally, even planted) until the soil is thoroughly warmed. If you have to set them in cool soil, mulch with a thin, dark, porous weed barrier, ideally a biodegradable one.</p>
        <p>Arrange straw around tomatoes, peppers, eggplants and okra after the soil is well warmed but before it's hot. If you used a barrier at planting time, just pile the mulch on top.</p>
        <p>Once the mulch is in place, close to but not touching the plants, don't mess with it unless you see rotting stems, moldy leaves or an invasion of slugs. You put it on to help hold that spring rain in the ground. If you move it to let the garden dry out, that's just what the garden will do, and when the rainless weeks of summer come, you will be sorry you didn't stay the course.</p>
