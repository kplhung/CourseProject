        <p>North Korea's reclusive leader, Kim Jong Il, made a secret visit to Beijing this week to consult China's leaders on the coming summit meeting between North and South Korea, China has informed other governments.</p>
        <p>On Thursday morning, a foreign ministry official in Seoul said that Chinese officials had just informed the South Koreans of the visit, the Agence France-Press news agency reported.</p>
        <p>Also on Thursday, the American Embassy in Beijing said that the Chinese had called in American officials ''to brief us on the rumors'' that Kim Jong Il had made a visit. American officials made it clear that any official announcement should come directly from the Chinese, who will hold a regularly scheduled news conference Thursday afternoon. The apparent confirmation comes after a day of speculation and rumors about the possible visit by the secretive North Korean leader, who has rarely left the country.</p>
        <p>The trip would be Mr. Kim's first overseas trip since succeeding his father, Kim Il Song, who died in July 1994, and may be a further sign that he is interested in reducing his country's isolation, experts here said.  Why he would choose to make such a trip in secrecy is unclear.</p>
        <p>The Chinese have long encouraged Mr. Kim to visit Beijing, but up to now he has not accepted. However, to the surprise of Chinese officials, Mr. Kim made an unusual visit to the Chinese embassy in Pyongyang. Mr. Kim and President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea are to meet in Pyongyang from June 12 to 14, in what diplomats hope will be a breakthrough between the hostile sides.</p>
