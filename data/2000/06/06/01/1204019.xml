        <p>In his first major attempt to communicate with parents, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy held a town meeting in Queens last night and fielded questions on standardized testing, sex education, summer school and other topics.</p>
        <p>Several hundred parents, grandparents, teachers and others filled the auditorium at Francis Lewis High School in Flushing to hear the new chancellor speak. Mr. Levy, who became the permanent chancellor just two weeks ago, stood in front with a microphone as dozens of people waited in two long lines to ask questions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy did not always give the answers they wanted to hear. When one mother asked if her son's school district could get better after-school programs, Mr. Levy replied that continuing training for teachers was more important. ''It's a finite pool of money,'' he said. ''If we had more, we'd do more.''</p>
        <p>And when another mother, Debra Artis of Flushing, complained about the new requirement that every student pass the State Regents exams to graduate, Mr. Levy vigorously defended the requirement. ''If you can't read and you can't do math, there's not going to be a place for you in the new economy,'' Mr. Levy told her.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Ms. Artis said she thought Mr. Levy's comments were insensitive and short-sighted.</p>
        <p>''His attitude was like, 'You're stuck with it and you have no option,' '' Ms. Artis said. ''It's unfair because kids like my daughter are getting frustrated and it's causing them to drop out.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Artis and another mother, Maxine Kupersmith of Flushing, praised Mr. Levy for allowing parents to vent their frustrations to him in person.</p>
        <p>''It's very nice of him to take the time to do this,'' said Ms. Kupersmith, who has a son in the ninth grade. ''He's not giving definite answers but at least he's listening.''</p>
        <p>New York City chancellors have long weathered criticism from parents for not involving them enough in policy decisions. Mr. Levy said last night that it would be an enormous challenge, but promised to make it a priority. He plans to hold one town meeting a month, starting in September, and to communicate with parents on talk radio shows.</p>
        <p>''What I take away from this,'' Mr. Levy said after taking questions for two hours, ''is a great sense of frustration with the inability to get the message across.''</p>
