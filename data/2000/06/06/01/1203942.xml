        <p>''Gore Coverup Revealed!'' read the headline on the e-mail message from Washington.</p>
        <p>The five-paragraph missive, beamed into electronic mailboxes of reporters across the country last week, was another swipe at Vice President Al Gore by the Republican National Committee. But it was not a  suggestion of political corruption or obstruction of justice that had prompted the official Republican bulletin. It was a report that Mr. Gore wore makeup.</p>
        <p>''This can't be Naomi Wolf's idea of an alpha male!'' the message quoted Jim Nicholson, the Republican national chairman, as having joked about a recent article in People magazine that said Mr. Gore used spray-on cosmetics.</p>
        <p>Hour by hour, the e-mail arrives like digital daggers from the candidates and their parties. Catty, pithy, weighty, gossipy, the messages materialize via the open cyberfaucet of the 2000 campaign. ''Bush's Million Mom Manipulation,'' began a message from the Democrats. ''Democrat Fat Cat Discriminates Against Those Who Flee Castro's Clutches,'' read one from the Republicans. ''New York Honor Guard Spat On at Clinton Nomination,'' read another.</p>
        <p>Only by extension is the target of the computer missives the American voter. The more immediate audience is the American journalist. ''Day 52: Reporters Held Hostage!'' screamed the headline of e-mail from the Republican National Committee in April. One of a series of such messages from the committee, it was intended to remind the press that the vice president had not held a news conference in 52 days. Under an illustration of political writers from Newsweek and The Washington Post in the stocks, it implored, ''Mr. Gore, please let these reporters go!''</p>
        <p>Campaigns, of course, have always whispered nasty little nothings about the opposition into reporters' ears. But just as e-mail has ushered in a new era of epistolary ease and connectedness for the world at large, it has also created a hyper-efficient form of press release, a paperless document that not only links the political world to the nation's assignment editors, columnists and news anchors in seconds, but also allows the campaigns to fire at each other at will, all day long.</p>
        <p>As a result, a presidential campaign is no longer so much a series of stops as an endless wave. Gaze at the laptop screen of any political reporter on the road these days and see how rapidly campaign e-mail accumulates: the Message of the Day has given way to the Message of the Last 10 Minutes. And, not surprisingly, in the proliferation of messages comes all manner of information: useful, irrelevant or irreverent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nicholson's alpha-male crack, for instance, made it onto the Perspectives page of the current issue of Newsweek, and the ''reporters held hostage'' messages were noted by newspapers and television commentators in April. (Late that month, after the count had passed 60 days, Mr. Gore held a news conference.)</p>
        <p>The ability to express so much is making campaign back-and-forth a kind of online bile duct. ''Everything keeps speeding up, and becoming less profound in the process,'' said Howard Fineman, a political analyst for Newsweek and MSNBC.</p>
        <p>Like many reporters, Mr. Fineman is ambivalent about all this e-mail, perplexed by the tone and the volume but anxious about the consequences of not receiving it.</p>
        <p>''I have several e-mail addresses,'' he said, ''and I just keep establishing new ones to get away from the old ones. And maybe once a week, I manfully press the 'control-A' combination, which highlights all of the e-mail, and then I hit the delete button.</p>
        <p>''Of course,'' he added, ''in the spirit of confession, I have to say that when I found that I wasn't on the latest version of the Gore campaign's e-mail list, I called them up and gave them a piece of my mind.''</p>
        <p>Any political operation of any importance today is online with a vengeance, and e-mail has become the baseline conveyance that the telephone and the fax machine once were. (Mention old-fashioned, Postal Service-type mail to campaign press secretaries, and they burst into laughter.)</p>
        <p>The message via computer is equal parts invasive and discreet. ''Right now, people take it more like a phone call than a press release,'' observed Clifford D. May, director of communications for the Republican National Committee.</p>
        <p>''The difference is, it's a phone call that's not in real time,'' he added. ''So I may e-mail to financial columnists that Al Gore says he owns no stocks whatsoever: 'Either he's not telling the truth or he's a financial dolt. Don't you think you should write about it?' ''</p>
        <p>The advantage? ''You're not interrupting someone on deadline. I suppose you could do that on a voice mail, but on e-mail you can take your time to compose the message, to make it as persuasive as you possibly can.''</p>
        <p>Reporters are by training disposed to discount the persuasion of the press release. But the campaigns and their allies insist that e-mail has made it easier to get their story into print or on the air faster. Jennifer Backus, press secretary for the Democratic National Committee, said that as the first round of news-agency accounts was transmitted during Republican presidential debates in the primary season, her staff would immediately respond to those accounts by sending e-mail to the writers -- and could see the results as quickly as the next cycle of reports that evening. By then, she said, the reports were reflecting the Democrats' own assessment of the  Republican debate.</p>
        <p>And in the game of rapid response -- getting your message out before your opponent's can make an impact -- e-mail delivered with surgical precision can pre-emptively alter the flow of a major story.</p>
        <p>''It was funny,'' said Craig Crawford, editor in chief of the online political digest Hotline. ''My e-mail sound file is from '2001: A Space Odyssey,' and early one morning HAL goes, 'You have received a message.' It was Al Gore's people with a response to the Social Security plan that Bush put out.''</p>
        <p>The oddity was that the message arrived before Gov. George W. Bush held the news conference where he formally unveiled his proposal to partly privatize Social Security. ''Before the sun was up, I had Bush's plan and Gore's response,'' Mr. Crawford said.</p>
        <p>Chris Lehane, press secretary for the Gore campaign, says the tactic,  which he calls ''pre-buttal,'' had the desired effect; the degree to which major newspapers reflected Mr. Gore's objections surprised even Mr. Lehane. Normally, he said, as much as 90 percent of the content might be devoted to the candidate making the proposal. With the rapid response, he said, ''my sense is you get 60-40 play.''</p>
        <p>Richard L. Berke, the chief political correspondent of The New York Times, said Mr. Lehane's calculation seemed slightly overstated. ''E-mails certainly help the candidates insinuate themselves into stories about their opponents,'' he said, ''but often we are so swamped by e-mails, it sometimes defeats their purpose.''</p>
        <p>There is a rollicking tabloid gusto in the tone of campaign e-mail, whether the Bush campaign is reinforcing the idea that Mr. Gore stretches the truth (in its continuing series ''The Gore Detector'') or the Gore campaign is hammering away at Mr. Bush's record in Texas (''one of the dirtiest states in the nation'').</p>
        <p>In a message posted last Friday, the Democratic National Committee renewed its daily efforts to get under Mr. Bush's skin with the suggestion that his campaign was trying to conceal a deeply conservative agenda. ''Today marks eight days that George W. Bush has refused to release a tape copy or a transcript of remarks he made to a far-right conservative organization last October,'' the message said.</p>
        <p>It arrived minutes before a Bush campaign bulletin intimating that Mr. Gore was not telling voters the truth about his Social Security plans, that he would either raise taxes or cut retirement benefits. Earlier in the day, the Gore campaign went online to say Mr. Bush had spoken to the Catholic Press Association ''without mentioning his very public embrace of anti-Catholic Bob Jones University during the Republican primary.'' Which came on the heels of Bush e-mail that summed up the week's events as ''Bush Leads, Gore Flounders.''</p>
        <p>Not only can e-mail circulate instantly, its recipients can forward it instantly: the virtual equivalent of stuffing fliers under thousands of windshields simultaneously. Campaign spokesmen say this can make the technology a useful way to talk to their rank and file as well as to reporters.</p>
        <p>It can also be just plain fun. Along with posting presidential candidate schedules (''The vice president remains overnight in Memphis'') and innocuous news tidbits (''Wisconsin Veterans Back Bush''), the campaigns engage in an endless cyberspace version of trash talk.</p>
        <p>The Democratic National Committee, in installments of a feature called ''Bush Lite,'' makes merciless sport of Mr. Bush's semantic gaffes and failures to communicate. ''Bush Confused Canadian Prime Minister With Canadian Cheese Curd Snack Treat,'' read an item that the Democrats posted on April 24.</p>
        <p>The Republican National Committee replies with a daily watch of Mr. Gore's lack of formal endorsement by former Senator Bill Bradley.  ''Missing,'' says the mock-up of a milk carton with the likeness of Mr. Bradley and the words ''Got endorsement?'' emblazoned on the side.</p>
        <p>''Sophomoric humor is a huge piece of this,'' Mr. Lehane said. ''It's got to go so over the top that people pay attention.''</p>
        <p>Short attention spans are, after all, another hallmark of the age of instant media gratification, an age when the saddest fate to befall a short and punchy computer message is that it be ignored. A fate that is alas inevitable for some electronic mail when messages are arriving in batches faster than you can say ''download.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. May, the Republican spokesman, himself acknowledged, ''I have 188 unread e-mails in my queue at the moment.''</p>
