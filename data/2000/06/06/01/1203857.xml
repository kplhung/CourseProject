        <p>DANIEL BROWN, a 32-year-old lawyer in Bethesda, Md., got the news in February that he had chronic myelogenous leukemia and that no one in his family had the proper genetic match to donate life-saving bone marrow.</p>
        <p>The disease kills 60 percent to 70 percent of patients within five years of diagnosis, according to bone-marrow specialists. ''Time is not on your side,'' said Mr. Brown's wife, Jolie. ''So some families do their own bone-marrow drive, and that's what we've done. We're not going to sit around and wait.''</p>
        <p>Within three weeks after hearing the diagnosis, the Browns were calling every friend and organization they knew, printing fliers and setting up drives to attract volunteer donors whose marrow might provide the critical match of proteins needed for a successful transplant.</p>
        <p>The family did something else, too. They got on the Internet, establishing their own Web site, Tomorrow for Dan (www.viaduct.com/helpdan). It is not just a plea for help; it is also a brief primer on the disease, a family photo albumand a link to the National Marrow Donor Program (www.marrow.org) and the donor program the Browns are working with, the Gift of Life Foundation (www.hlamatch.org).</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown estimated that his family and volunteers directly sent out at least 10,000 e-mail messages, not including those forwarded by their recipients. ''It's clearly opened a door that didn't exist previously, to allow you to communicate with a mass number of people in a short period of time,'' Mr. Brown said. It gave him a huge respect, he said, for the patients and groups that previously had to rely on direct mail.</p>
        <p>Bone-marrow donor registries and the Internet have grown up together in the last 10 years, and both have revolutionized the potential of bone-marrow transplants when a matching donor cannot be found in a patient's immediate family.</p>
        <p>Since the National Marrow Donor Program, a nonprofit organization based in Minneapolis, began in 1986, the number of volunteer potential donors registered with it has risen to just under four million, from fewer than 100,000 at the beginning of 1990.  As of May 14, the program had been involved in 9,715 transplants of stem cells from unrelated donors, compared with 533 by 1990. Stem cells are what transplant patients need to make new, healthy marrow.</p>
        <p>It is much harder to match types of bone marrow than types of blood. People have about a 30 percent chance of matching with a family member. If that fails, the next option is to search registries of people who have volunteered to donate marrow. On average, about one in 20,000 unrelated people match closely enough for a bone-marrow donation.</p>
        <p>The number of registered potential donors has roughly doubled since the first of the program's Web sites was set up in 1995. ''Originally we created a site with a target audience of physicians,'' said Devan Shepherd, director of information systems. ''We discovered that patients and their families were using it.''</p>
        <p>The program's computer system manages all patient searches, tracks detailed patient histories and maintains the four-million-member registry. At any time, it is processing searches for more than 3,000 patients. The donor program communicates online daily with 350 to 400 groups around the country, including hospitals, community groups and donor centers.</p>
        <p>In transplant centers, Mr. Shepherd said, new online tools provided by the program shorten the time it takes to search national and international registries to find matches. In some cases, the search for a potential unrelated stem-cell donor that used to take a day can now be done in seconds.</p>
        <p>There are dozens of independent bone-marrow and related registries worldwide, and they do not share all their information. Most, but not all, do share the basic tissue data for the more than 6.4 million people worldwide who have given samples; it is forwarded to Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide, in Leiden, the Netherlands. That group's Web site, www.bmdw.org, is open to doctors and the public, and includes technical data, information about how to become a marrow donor, extensive links to more information about the procedure and cancer treatment, and information on donor registries worldwide.</p>
        <p>''It's not updated as often as some of us would like,'' said Dr. Dennis L. Confer, the chief medical officer for the National Marrow Donor Program. The international registry updates its list monthly. For information other than the basic tissue types, doctors have to write, phone or send faxes or e-mail to the individual registries, Dr. Confer said.</p>
        <p>''More and more, the ability to access donors through online communications is going to become the norm,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Pamela J. Weisdorf, director of the program's office of patient advocacy, said its Web site was being redesigned for user-friendliness with the help of a 12-member advisory group, including patients and their family members. ''They want information about their disease,'' sometimes even before they know they need a transplant, she said. ''One of the other things they tell us is, 'Please, you have to put things into language we can understand.' ''</p>
        <p>There is also a difference between Web language and medical language. Take the word ''search,'' Ms. Weisdorf said. It means one thing to most Internet users, but to patients facing a life-or-death deadline, it means searching for an unrelated-donor match.</p>
        <p>A related site, BMT Information (www.bmtinfo.org) is a cooperative effort of the National Marrow Donor Program and the national and international donor registries, and receives federal financing. It has a glossary and an Ask the Expertsection, with doctors' answers to submitted questions.</p>
        <p>Another online resource is the Blood and Marrow Transplant Newsletter (www.bmtnews.org), run from Highland Park, Ill. It lists books that can be ordered online and links patients with people who have undergone the process. It has a database of more than 250 transplant centers that can be searched by location, type of disease treated and type of transplant offered. The newsletter also has an online directory of specialized health care organizations with more information, and guidance for patients with fund-raising needs and insurance problems.</p>
        <p>''It became apparent that a lot of people were starting to get their information in the wee hours using their computers,'' said Susan K. Stewart, executive director of BMT Infonet, a small nonprofit group that sponsors the newsletter. It gets about 100,000 hits a month, she added.</p>
        <p>With the help of the Gift of Life Foundation, which is open to anyone but has focused on patients and donors of Eastern European Jewish background, the Brown family organized six drives for Daniel through early May, attracting 7,238 potential donors who had their blood tested. (Having your tissue type determined and getting on the registry is like having a blood test in a doctor's office, and requires only a test tube's worth.)</p>
        <p>One of the 703 blood donors at the April 31 drive at the Central Synagogue in Manhattan, David Wohl, 29, was a fraternity brother of Daniel Brown's, but had been three years behind him and knew him only vaguely. ''I received an e-mail from another frat brother,'' Mr. Wohl said. The news shocked him. ''I felt for Dan and his family,'' he said. ''I went to the Web site and read more.''</p>
        <p>Evan Cowit, 31, a lawyer and a friend of a friend of Daniel Brown's, also donated. Without the e-mail he received, he said, he probably would never have heard about the drive. ''I sent it around to everyone I could think of who was Eastern European Jewish and who hadn't already got it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In late May, the Browns were informed that at least two potential matching donors had been identified, and those tissue samples are undergoing further tests. Because of confidentiality rules, they do not know whether the donors had been previously registered or if one of them came from their family's drives for Dan. Regardless, to Jolie Brown, their efforts were worth it.</p>
        <p>''Of the thousands of people we're trying to test,'' Mrs. Brown said, ''we'll surely save somebody's life, and that is a wonderful feeling.''</p>
