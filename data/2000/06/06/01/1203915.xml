        <p>DANIEL GROSS would not presume to offer advice to the survivors of those shot in the massacre at Wendy's in Flushing last Wednesday night. Grieving, he explains simply, is personal.</p>
        <p>But he does have an observation for the families of the seven men and women who were shot, five of them killed. ''Something like this colors everything you do the rest of your life,'' said Mr. Gross. ''Whether the families make a decision like I did or try to go back to their old lives, this profoundly changes your life. Not a day or an hour goes by when I don't think back.''</p>
        <p>Back to Feb. 23, 1997, the day when Daniel Gross's younger brother, Matthew, became a victim of the kind of random gun violence that has become achingly familiar in America. In even tones, Mr. Gross tells the story of how he got the news, as if describing a movie he had seen, not a drama he had experienced:</p>
        <p>''It was the morning after I had celebrated my 30th birthday with my family. I remember my brother waving goodbye out of the car window. The next day I was watching the Knicks-Lakers game. They broke into the game and said there had been this shooting on the roof of the Empire State Building. I reacted the way all people do, with sorrow and sympathy for the victims.</p>
        <p>''I turned to CNN, saw footage of the victims being taken out of the Empire State Building. I turned back to the Knicks game. The Lakers tied it up. I was upset about that. The next second the phone rang. It was my father. He said Matthew had been shot. My life hasn't been the same since. I still don't know who won.''</p>
        <p>Matthew and his band mate, Chris Burmeister of Denmark, both 27, were among seven people gunned down by a Palestinian man who then killed himself. Matthew, his brain injured, and five other victims lived. Chris died. And Daniel changed.</p>
        <p>He avoids streets that have a view of the Empire State Building. He stays off Fifth Avenue. And the former partner at J. Walter Thompson now works full time for Pax, a gun control group he co-founded two years ago. He draws a modest salary now instead of a partner's income, lives in Manhattan with his bride, who works in advertising, and uses his skills to sell gun control instead of Listerine.</p>
        <p>''I found I couldn't go back to my everyday life,'' he said yesterday, in Pax's midtown office. ''It really was an opportunity to do something about gun violence using exactly the skills and background I'd gotten in advertising. That's what's missing from the gun violence issue.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gross began speaking publicly about gun control -- angrily and emotionally -- when his brother was still hospitalized. A lot can change in three years. Matthew Gross lives with their father in Montclair, N.J., and works part time in retail sales, said his brother, who, to respect Matthew's privacy, declined to go into more detail.</p>
        <p>Daniel Gross, who was described in one news account as speaking with ''controlled rage'' in 1997 about government's failure to control guns, now expresses himself thoughtfully and supports his assertions with statistics. He harbors no bitterness toward his brother's attacker, he says, and opposes the death penalty as ''economically discriminatory and inherently racist.''</p>
        <p>His objective is to reach the majority of Americans who, surveys convince him, support ''common sense'' gun restrictions like registration and licensing. But the ordinary citizenry is overpowered by the heavily financed and therefore politically influential gun lobby. That imbalance could change, Mr. Gross suggests, if people saw gun violence as something that ''goes from being a seemingly random, high-profile tragedy to something that could affect them personally.''</p>
        <p>HENCE Pax's new campaign -- ASK (for Asking Saves Kids) -- which focuses on guns in the home. Studies show that 40 percent of families with children have guns at home, said Mr. Gross. Later this month, Pax will start an ad campaign urging people to ask if parents of their children's friends keep a gun in the house.</p>
        <p>Daniel Gross says he doesn't want what happened to his brother to keep on happening. Finding a way to try to turn tragedy into something positive has been cathartic, he said, and he wishes that for the dear ones of the Wendy's victims, a way to deal with what will never go away.</p>
        <p>''Every time one of these tragedies happens it takes you back,'' he said. ''Again, everybody's grief is personal, but I can identify with these families, with how I felt when I got that call. They are now committed to a lifetime of living with this memory. I would be lying if I said it gets much better. Like any pain it lessens over time. But it never completely goes away.''</p>
