        <p>They knew their company had been under intense scrutiny, but employees of New York Apple Tours still shook their heads in disbelief yesterday after hearing that the state had ordered the operator's double-decker buses off the streets.</p>
        <p>Some workers quietly agreed that the city had a right to investigate the company's environmental and safety record, especially after a pedestrian was struck and killed by an Apple Tours bus last week.

        <p>They knew their company had been under intense scrutiny, but employees of New York Apple Tours still shook their heads in disbelief yesterday after hearing that the state had ordered the operator's double-decker buses off the streets.</p>
        <p>Some workers quietly agreed that the city had a right to investigate the company's environmental and safety record, especially after a pedestrian was struck and killed by an Apple Tours bus last week. But they wondered if the state might have had other options. Without a job, the workers asked, how would they feed their children and pay their bills?</p>
        <p>''I'm very surprised,'' Amadou Sabi, 45, said moments after hearing the news early yesterday afternoon when he arrived at the company's visitor center at Eighth Avenue and 48th Street.</p>
        <p>''I thought they were going to give us some time,'' said Mr. Sabi, a ticket seller who worked for Apple Tours for eight years. ''I don't know what to do. I have a wife, two kids, a family to support.''</p>
        <p>Maria Martin, 35, another ticker seller and who had been with the company for five years, said she felt like a member of her family had died. ''I love the work and I love the family,'' she said. ''It's hard.''</p>
        <p>The temporary shutdown order was also hard on hundreds of tourists who had bought tickets for a tour of Manhattan aboard Apple Tours' red buses for yesterday.</p>
        <p>Brenda Field, a visitor from Australia, said she had ridden one block aboard a bus when a guide said about 1:30 p.m. that the tour was over. ''Sorry, folks, but we've been closed down,'' the guide told the bus of tourists, Ms. Field said,</p>
        <p>''I'm very angry,'' said Ms. Field, who arrived in New York with her husband. ''This is our first day here and this is what we're confronted with.''</p>
        <p>Dozens of tourists demanded refunds and stormed off after Apple Tours employees told them none would be given. Later in the afternoon, other tourists were told their tickets would be honored by Apple Tours' competitors, Gray Line and New York Double-Decker.</p>
        <p>Craig P. Heard, president of New York Double-Decker, confirmed that his company would accept Apple Tours tickets. Lee Gelber, manager of tour services for Gray Line, said the company would honor tickets bought from tourism companies that do business with Gray Line. But he said his company would not accept tickets bought from other operators or directly from Apple Tours.</p>
        <p>''Apple has collected all the money, and there's no way they're going to pay it to us, not that we can envision,'' Mr. Gelber said.</p>
        <p>The 300 workers of Apple Tours, meanwhile, passionately defended the right of their company to operate. By evening, dozens had gathered in front of the visitors center, saying the city's charges were ''bogus'' and a ''set-up.''</p>
        <p>A tour guide, Eva Lee, screamed that the company was being unfairly maligned.</p>
        <p>In private conversations throughout the afternoon, some workers were more circumspect.</p>
        <p>''They should put restrictions on us if they want, more point checks, but they shouldn't shut us down,'' said Juan Gonzalez, a dispatcher and a five-year veteran of Apple Tours.</p>
        <p>Lorenzo Smith, 23, a driver who said he was ticketed last week for driving a bus without the proper license, said the temporary shutdown was probably a good thing for him. ''This is what I needed to get out of here,'' he said. ''I needed a little more stability, and this company wasn't doing it for me.''</p>
