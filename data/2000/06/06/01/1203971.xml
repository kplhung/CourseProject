        <p>After nearly a month of negotiations with Madison Square Garden's president, Dave Checketts, and chairman, James L. Dolan, Glen Sather will be formally introduced today as the Rangers' new team president and general manager at a Madison Square Garden news conference.</p>
        <p>Several National Hockey League officials confirmed that Sather had agreed to a five-year contract believed to be worth $15 million to rebuild the club. The deal includes stock options in Cablevision, of which Dolan is chief executive. Cablevision owns the Garden and the Rangers.</p>

        <p>After nearly a month of negotiations with Madison Square Garden's president, Dave Checketts, and chairman, James L. Dolan, Glen Sather will be formally introduced today as the Rangers' new team president and general manager at a Madison Square Garden news conference.</p>
        <p>Several National Hockey League officials confirmed that Sather had agreed to a five-year contract believed to be worth $15 million to rebuild the club. The deal includes stock options in Cablevision, of which Dolan is chief executive. Cablevision owns the Garden and the Rangers.</p>
        <p>''He's definitely got complete control,'' a league official said of Sather.</p>
        <p>The 56-year-old Sather, who flew to New York from his La Quinta, Calif., home yesterday with his wife, Ann, was customarily coy.</p>
        <p>''Now why do you think they're having a news conference?'' Sather asked with a laugh.</p>
        <p>Sather's first assignment would be to persuade Kevin Lowe to coach the Rangers. One person close to Sather said he had asked Lowe, who was Sather's head coach in Edmonton last season, to meet him in New York today so that he could introduce him as the Rangers' head coach.</p>
        <p>Lowe, this person said, declined, because he needed more time to make a decision. Edmonton's 37-man ownership group has asked Lowe to succeed Sather as general manager. Lowe said he would probably make up his mind early next week. ''I can't see it going much longer than that,'' Lowe said yesterday. ''It's 50-50 either way. But more so, it's do I want to be a general manager or a coach, rather than New York or Edmonton.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers have not qualified for the playoffs for the last three seasons, since Mark Messier left the team in a messy divorce in the summer of 1997.</p>
        <p>Sather's hiring today is the surest sign that Messier, who led the Rangers to their first Stanley Cup in 54 years in 1994, will return and finish his career in New York. It is unlikely that Vancouver will pick up the option on Messier's $6 million contract, which would enable Messier to become a free agent on July 1. Messier was the leader of all five of Edmonton's Stanley Cup championship teams and was their captain in 1990, one season after Wayne Gretzky was sold to Los Angeles. Lowe was Messier's teammate on all five of those teams and again with the Rangers when they won in 1994.</p>
        <p>The Sather negotiations began after he resigned as Edmonton's president and general manager on May 19 after 24 years in the Oilers' organization, the last 21 as general manager. Sather had grown tired of having to answer to 37 owners, especially after Cal Nichols succeeded Sather's good friend, Jim Hole, as chairman of the Edmonton ownership group. In New York, Sather will still have to answer to Checketts, a league official said.</p>
        <p>Sather, Checketts and Dolan first met in the first week of May and have met and spoken several times since. It became clear that Sather was the Rangers' only choice to succeed Neil Smith, who was fired as president and general manager on March 28, as was Coach John Muckler.</p>
        <p>Sather, who was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1997, was an outspoken champion of small-market Canadian teams, a fiscal conservative who routinely criticized the free-spending ways of teams like the Rangers. Now, Sather is taking over a team with a huge budget -- a league record $61.2 million last season.</p>
        <p>The Rangers represent a very different challenge for Sather, who played left wing for the Rangers for parts of four seasons from 1970-73. As a coach and general manager, Sather assembled the Edmonton dynasty, but the Oilers won their last cup in 1990. This is Sather's chance to prove that, given the resources, he has not lost his touch to build a winner. The Sather hiring continues a trend by the Rangers to look to Edmonton to cure their ills.</p>
        <p>With complete control of hockey operations, Sather's choice of Lowe as head coach would be endorsed by Checketts. Sather could easily double the likely $700,000 the Oilers are believed to be offering Lowe to become their general manager.</p>
        <p>Lowe said that if he chooses to continue coaching, ''I would be happy to accept the challenge. I would love to come back to New York. But let's cross that bridge when we come to it.''</p>
