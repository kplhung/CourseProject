        <p>The New York Philharmonic said yesterday that it was naming Zarin Mehta, who runs Chicago's prestigious Ravinia Festival, to be its executive director starting in September.</p>
        <p>As the orchestra's top administrative official, Mr. Mehta will supervise its business operations and bookings. He succeeds Deborah Borda, who became executive vice president and managing director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic late last year.</p>
        <p>The official announcement, set for today, does not include the naming of a successor to Kurt Masur as the orchestra's music director. Riccardo Muti, music director of La Scala Opera, is the Philharmonic's leading choice for the position, which will become vacant in 2002.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mehta, 61, whose brother, Zubin, was the music director of the Philharmonic for a record 13 years until 1991, said yesterday that he and the orchestra's chairman, Paul B. Guenther, had met with Mr. Muti in Milan last week and that the two looked forward to working together as a team. ''He's very interested in the New York Philharmonic,'' Mr. Mehta said. But he said that contract terms remained to be worked out and that Mr. Muti's representative, David Foster, was in Milan now meeting with his client.</p>
        <p>Mr. Guenther said that discussions were continuing with Mr. Muti, 58.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing imminent, but it's definitely moving in the right direction,'' Mr. Guenther said.</p>
        <p>Although some orchestra members thought the two appointments might be made simultaneously, Mr. Guenther said, ''There was never any plan to announce them together.'' The orchestra leaves on a European tour on Monday, and nothing will be announced before its return on June 30, he said.</p>
        <p>He denied that the talks had hit a snag over salary or Mr. Muti's commitments to the Vienna Philharmonic and the Berlin Philharmonic, which he regularly conducts,  in addition to La Scala. ''It's proceeding in a professional fashion,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Last week Mr. Muti was quoted in an Agence France-Presse article from Milan as saying that the Philharmonic post ''is very available'' but that ''it's me who must make a decision, and before accepting I must find the right balance between various obligations.''</p>
        <p>One Lincoln Center official said that the orchestra, smitten as it was with Mr. Muti after his visits as a guest conductor, was seeking assurance that he would continue Mr. Masur's attachment to New York ''and not just fly in and out.''</p>
        <p>''There's a strong feeling this is a marriage, not an affair,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mehta was one of 40 candidates offered by the recruiting firm of Spencer Stuart &amp; Associates, but he quickly topped the list, Mr. Guenther said. ''We were told the best is Zarin Mehta, but you'll never get him,'' he said. He called Mr. Mehta ''the best executive director in the country.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mehta, since 1990 president and chief executive officer of Ravinia, the open-air music festival in Highland Park, near Chicago, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's summer home since 1936, said that his appointment, given his family's history, was ''an extraordinary move for me.'' In addition to his brother's involvement with the Philharmonic, his father, Mehli Mehta, a violinist and conductor, studied in New York in the 1940's. A cousin, Bejun Mehta, is a countertenor who as a boy soprano sang for Leonard Bernstein.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Zarin Mehta, who was born in Bombay, entered the music world as an accountant. Trained in England, he sought an accounting job in New York in 1962 but was turned away for fear he might head back to Europe or go to Canada to escape the Vietnam-era draft. He did move to Canada to work for the accounting firm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand and joined the board of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, becoming its vice president. In 1981 he was named managing director and served until 1990, when he took over the Ravinia Festival.</p>
        <p>His musical training was nil, he said proudly. ''My parents successfully kept me away from it,'' he said. For his administrative duties, he said, ''accounting is better than being an oboe player.'' He said he looked forward to working with Mr. Masur and, if plans jelled, with Mr. Muti. ''It's a very strange marriage, music director and executive director,'' he said. ''They're jointly responsible. They have to be thinking along the same lines.''</p>
        <p>Could he have worked with his brother, Zubin? He didn't pause to consider it. ''We would have fought tooth and nail,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As for his plans for changes at the Philharmonic, he said it would be presumptuous to speak of that yet. But he had one priority. ''I want to attend a parks concert,'' he said.</p>
