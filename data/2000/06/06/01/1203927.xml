        <p>At his most recent meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, was astonished to be presented with a diagram showing the American view of Europe today.</p>
        <p>''It showed circles intersecting with other circles that intersected with still more circles in a rather bamboozling way,'' said Andreas Michelis, a Foreign Ministry spokesman. ''The American question was: where do we turn among all these elements?''</p>
        <p>The circles in question represented national governments, the European Union, the new office of Europe's ''high representative'' for foreign and security affairs and other institutions. As President Clinton starts a three-day visit to Berlin on Thursday, they also provide an apt image of the uncertain flux in the American relationship with Germany and its European partners.</p>
        <p>That an era has passed is clear. This is the first visit by the President to Berlin since the government moved here from Bonn and so brought down the final curtain on the decades of postwar Allied tutelage of Germany. Less apparent, however, are the focus and equilibrium of a relationship set adrift by the end of the cold war.</p>
        <p>At a recent meeting with a handful of correspondents here, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder complained that the United States constantly pressed the ''new Germany'' to assume responsibilities commensurate with its size, but whenever Germany raised its voice, the old misgivings about German power reared their heads once more.</p>
        <p>The chancellor was speaking in the aftermath of the debacle over the choice of a new managing-director for the International Monetary Fund, an appointment pursued and won by Germany with a bludgeoning vigor that shocked officials in Washington. But his point was a broader one about the awkward transition in trans-Atlantic relations.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration, under pressure from Congress, wants Germany to do more -- send thousands of troops to Kosovo, increase its defense spending, stimulate its big economy through deregulation -- just as it wants several other European allies to assume broader responsibilities.</p>
        <p>But when Germany and its European partners try to coordinate that defense spending, develop their own military identity within NATO through the formation of a 60,000 strong rapid-reaction corps, and generally sketch a partial emancipation from American strategic dominance, Washington gets uneasy.</p>
        <p>''The United States says it wants a clear phone number for a Europe with some real cohesion,'' said Jurgen Chrobog, the German ambassador to the United States. ''But when we try to give it one, we have problems.''</p>
        <p>A NATO diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the main American concern was that the European Union's push to develop a military capacity within NATO would multiply committees and bureaucracy, increasing confusion but not effectiveness. ''And in the end, if the European Union takes on its own collective defense, you would have to ask what NATO is for,'' he added.</p>
        <p>At the root of the American unease lies the fact that, having completed their economic union through the introduction of the shared euro currency, Germany and its European allies have embarked on a determined push for political and military integration.</p>
        <p>This European road is fraught and will certainly be long. Britain is by no means the only place where resistance to further integration exists. But Europeans have already done something that now distinguishes the essence of their nationhood from that of the United States: given up a huge slice of sovereignty by surrendering control of the currency to a transnational European institution.</p>
        <p>''Any major German interest now requires multilateral action, whether it's the euro, or security concerns over Russia, where we deal through the European Union and NATO,'' said Karl Kaiser, a political scientist. ''But that is not the case in the United States, and this can cause tension.''</p>
        <p>The most recent instance of such tension has arisen over American plans for a limited missile defense system that Germans see as a doubtful defense against ''rogue states'' whose real menace is widely questioned.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton sought to allay these concerns today by saying the technology would be shared with ''other civilized nations'' -- a reference to allies in Europe.</p>
        <p>But however this debate is handled, it has already illustrated divergent views between the United States and a Europe increasingly ready to speak with one voice on a strategic issue.</p>
        <p>''You have an overwhelming superpower on the one hand and an emerging Europe learning to articulate its interest on the other,'' said a close aide to Mr. Schroder. ''That is the delicate post-cold-war equation we face.''</p>
        <p>The shifting nature of that equation is evident in the fact that some people here have taken to saying that a more accurate name for the new ''Berlin Republic'' would be the ''Brussels Republic.'' Brussels is the headquarters of the European Union.</p>
        <p>''We have learned that the more we press our interests multilaterally through Europe, the more we in Germany get for ourselves,'' said Josef Joffe of the respected weekly Die Zeit. ''This will not change.''</p>
        <p>How far Germany will be able to combine this strategy with its traditional role as chief European bridge to Washington is the long-term question facing a country that still feels deeply beholden to the United States for its post-war recovery.</p>
        <p>During his stay, Mr. Clinton will receive the International Charlemagne Prize, presented annually to a person who has worked for European unity. The choice of the President suggests the hope that, despite much evidence to the contrary, America and European nations have an identical interest in the forging of a United States of Europe.</p>
