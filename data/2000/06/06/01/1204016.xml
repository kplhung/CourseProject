        <p>MANHATTAN: FILMING MOVED  A commercial scheduled to be filmed yesterday at Rikers Island using nonunion actors was canceled by Bernard Kerik, the head of the Correction Department, after the correction officers union raised concerns about crossing picket lines. The Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists have been on strike against commercial producers since May 1 over pay issues. A spokesman for Southwestern Bell Communications said its commercial would still be produced, but not at Rikers.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: GUN CONTROL BILL  Representative Jerrold L. Nadler said yesterday that he would introduce an amendment to the federal criminal code next week to bar the sale of guns in kit form through magazines and the Internet. Mr. Nadler, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, said his plan would change the definition of firearm in federal statutes to include components of guns like barrels, stocks and actions, thereby barring their sale across state lines.

        <p>BROOKLYN: PORNOGRAPHY PLEA  A Brooklyn man pleaded guilty yesterday to running a worldwide child pornography club on the Internet in which members traded pornographic images of prepubescent boys and girls. The man, Peter Giordano, 37, admitted in Federal District Court in Brooklyn to having created the online club named '#wOnderland' after ''Alice in Wonderland.'' Prosecutors said Mr. Giordano operated the site from March 1997 to September 1998 and restricted membership to people who had at least 10,000 pornographic images.</p>

        <p>NEW YORK CITY: MORE JOBS  New York is second only to Atlanta in the number of jobs created in the last year, according to figures on employment in metropolitan areas released yesterday by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Employers in New York added 90,500  positions in the year ended April; Atlanta added 103,000 and Los Angeles had an additional 88,200. But unemployment in New York City, at 5.1 percent, is the third highest among big cities, after Miami (5.6 percent) and Los Angeles (5.2 percent).</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: EAST SIDE ATTACKS  Two women were attacked within 10 minutes on the Upper East Side, but the police said no evidence thus far linked the attacks to an East Side rapist sought in assaults on at least 16 women. The first attack occurred Tuesday at 11:59 a.m. at East 92nd Street and Lexington Avenue, and the second at 12:08 p.m. at 93rd Street and Fifth Avenue, four blocks away. In both cases, the attackers fled when the women screamed.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: HOSPITAL REVIEW  Beth Israel Medical Center has begun an outside review prompted by the case of Dr. Allan Zarkin, the obstetrician who carved his initials into a patient's abdomen after delivering her baby. The hospital has hired consultants from the Greeley Company, to recommend improvements in quality control and employee screening, as required under sanctions from  the State Department of Health. Beth Israel must make improvements within a month of getting the consultants' reports.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: INVESTIGATION SOUGHT  Asian-American groups demanded yesterday that the federal government look into possible violations of civil rights laws in an attack on Asian students at the State University of New York in Binghamton on Feb. 27. The assault left a student with a fractured skull. The three suspects are white members of the school's wrestling team. The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund  began a letter-writing campaign yesterday to urge the Justice Department to open an investigation.</p>

        <p>SARATOGA SPRINGS: PLAN FOR HUDSON  An independent panel of scientists last night endorsed the Environmental Protection Agency's conclusion that industrial chemicals in the upper Hudson River pose a cancer risk to people who regularly eat fish caught north of Poughkeepsie. The decision clears the way for the agency to decide how to clean up the river's last substantial form of pollution by the end of the year. The contamination consists of tons of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, chemicals that were dumped from two General Electric factories 200 miles upriver from Manhattan until 1977.</p>

        <p>MONTVALE: PRANK GOES AWRY  Senior Prank Day at Pascack Hills High School started last Thursday with a joke and ended with an ambulance when the principal was hospitalized with chest pains. Just before 10 a.m., a group of seniors, prompted by a secret cue over the school intercom, released hundreds of rubber balls, about 50 crickets and about a dozen mice and rats, students said yesterday. Officials questioned a senior girl about the intercom cue and some students walked out in protest. Two false fire alarms then sounded within an hour, prompting the school's 600 students to evacuate. After the alarms, the principal, Manual Ferreira, was taken to a hospital and underwent angioplasty for a clogged artery.</p>

        <p>PATERSON: SCHOOLS PLAN  Paterson's public school system on Tuesday unveiled a five-year plan to build 11  schools for $570 million. Several of Paterson's schools are more than 100 years old.</p>

        <p>GREENWICH: DEMOLITION PLAN  The town has granted a permit to raze a house where a teenager was slain 25 years ago.  Michael Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, has been charged in the murder of 15-year-old Martha Moxley, who was beaten to death. The move ends uncertainty over whether lawyers would seek to delay demolition so that eventual jurors might view the crime scene. It was not known why the current owners of the 18-room house  want to tear it down.</p>

        <p>STORRS: NEW LAW DEAN  Nell Jessup Newton, a leading authority on American Indian law, will become the first woman to be dean of the University of Connecticut School of Law. Ms. Newton, dean of the University of Denver College of Law, will succeed Hugh Macgill, dean  for 10 years.</p>
