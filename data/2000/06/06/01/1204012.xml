        <p>Nine days after a double-decker tour bus killed a pedestrian at a Midtown Manhattan intersection, Gov. George E. Pataki today shut down the tour company for at least two weeks, and vowed to put it out of business permanently.</p>
        <p>The governor had the State Department of Motor Vehicles suspend the vehicle registrations for all 63 buses run by New York Apple Tours, after an investigation by an array of city and state agencies found hundreds of violations of state laws. Those violations could result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines against the company, and possible jail time for some of its employees.</p>
        <p>The company, which has repeatedly run afoul of city, state and federal authorities, can contest the suspensions at a D.M.V. hearing on June 13. If it fails, the buses will be off the road permanently.</p>
        <p>''We can't tolerate an operation that ignores the regulations and flouts the law,'' Mr. Pataki told reporters here. ''They should be, in my view, put out of business.''</p>
        <p>The company's double-decker buses have become a ubiquitous presence on city streets in recent years. But as the buses have proliferated with the city's tourism boom, they have also drawn angry criticism in residential neighborhoods for clogging and polluting streets, as well as for posing safety threats.</p>
        <p>The death of the pedestrian last week heightened pressure for stronger action against the company.</p>
        <p>While the company could, in theory, resume operation with a new fleet of buses, state officials said the Department of Motor Vehicles could make it very difficult for New York Apple to receive new vehicle registrations.</p>
        <p>The Giuliani administration has already moved to revoke the company's operating license, and today an administrative judge temporarily sided with the city, suspending its license until full hearings into the matter are completed.</p>
        <p>The state order was served on the company this morning, state officials said, and should have been effective immediately, but New York Apple's readily recognizable bright red double-decker buses continued to run throughout the day. And for tourists, there were alternatives like Gray Line and New York Double Decker.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani released a statement saying that ''commuters and visitors will be safer'' because of the governor's action.</p>
        <p>The tour company refused requests to interview its officials, but it issued a statement in which it said it was ''shocked and surprised'' by the state's action and contended that the company had been treated unfairly.</p>
        <p>''We are dismayed by this administration's rush to judgment without granting us our day in court,'' the statement said. ''We look forward to defending and clearing our good name and serving the visitors of the greatest city in the world.''</p>
        <p>Today, opponents of the company praised the governor's action, but said the city and the state should have moved against the company long ago. ''I'm only sorry that someone had to die for us to get this kind of response,'' said State Senator Thomas K. Duane of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>While the city had been moving for a month to shut the company down, it was the death of Randolph Walker, a 71-year-old actor, on May 22 that brought matters to this point.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker was strolling home from an audition when he was hit at Ninth Avenue and 45th Street, where, the police said, he was crossing with the right of way. They said the bus driver, Howard Scott, 41, was not licensed to drive a bus.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki said that after Mr. Walker was killed, he ordered an immediate audit of the company, and he and Mayor Giuliani arranged for a hasty investigation by a variety of agencies, looking into every aspect of its operations.</p>
        <p>Typically, the state audits the operation of bus companies every three years, and New York Apple was due for an audit next year.</p>
        <p>The new state audit, by the motor vehicle department and city and state transportation agencies, found 625 violations of state laws, triple the number that were found in a 1998 audit.</p>
        <p>New York Apple, which also operates tours in Brooklyn, has been cited by the city and state for a wide range of misdeeds, like switching license plates on buses to avoid inspections, violating building and environmental codes at its garage and driving off its authorized routes.</p>
        <p>The company's drivers have received 1,400 traffic summonses, including many for reckless driving, and have been involved in 140 accidents, according to city officials.</p>
        <p>Last year, the company admitted lying to the federal government about the age of the buses it was importing from Britain to circumvent emissions standards, and paid an $800,000 fine.</p>
        <p>In 1998 and 1999, safety inspectors from the State Department of Transportation gave failing grades to 42 percent of the company's buses, often for faulty brakes.</p>
        <p>In the new audit, the company was cited 245 times for failing to notify the Department of Motor Vehicles every time it hired or fired a driver, 205 times for failing to maintain complete records on its drivers, and dozens of times each for failing to check drivers' driving records before hiring them and for failing to give them physicals.</p>
        <p>In a parallel investigation, the State Department of Environmental Conservation said it found several violations of environmental laws at its depot in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn. Two of those are misdemeanor crimes that could mean a year in jail for company officials: failure to register a waste oil tank with the state, and failure to take adequate measures to keep that tank from leaking.</p>
        <p>The department found that the company had illegally disposed of used motor oil and allowed oil to contaminate the groundwater.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki said that the State Department of Insurance had subpoenaed company records to see whether it had complied with laws on liability coverage.</p>
