        <p>The Indiana Pacers could not keep Spike Lee out of Conseco Fieldhouse. He already had tickets before tonight.</p>
        <p>But they were able to give seven tickets for prime seats for Game 5 to members of one Indianapolis family, ages 6 to 19, when a few season ticket-holders took up a buy-back offer from Melvin and Herb Simon, the team's owners.</p>
        <p>The owners offered to buy back unused season tickets before brokers could get them and sell them to Knicks fans.</p>
        <p>The owners did so in response to complaints from Reggie Miller and Jalen Rose, who were angry that Knicks fans seemed to be inundating the courtside seats at the Fieldhouse, especially during Game 2.</p>
        <p>Rose said: ''My personal thoughts, we have a lot of fans who are loyal Pacer fans, and for those people not to be able sit in the second row, when we have 10 New York Knicks' fans in there waiving towels and jeering at our home team on our home floor, obviously, that's real disturbing.''</p>
        <p>David Kahn, the Pacers' general manager, said: ''Whatever the price was we matched. I hope we made an unemotional, thoughtful, philanthropic response to what I think is a pretty emotional issue. I think we made people, perhaps, if they were planning to sell their tickets, I think we made them at least be sensitive to the fact that we'd prefer that they sell them to people who are rooting for the Pacers.''</p>
        <p>With the exception of the Indianapolis family, who showed up wearing Pacers jerseys, the plea did not entirely work. Knicks fans dressed in orange and blue and waiving towels and boasting banners were still well-represented at courtside, but looked on as their team lost, 88-79.</p>
        <p>Those Knicks fans sitting at courtside had bought their seats from ticket brokers. The Simons were offering to match the prices for the first seven rows around the court.</p>
        <p>At face value the seats go between $200 and $400 and ticket brokers can resell from between $600 and $1,200, said Taylor Smith, owner of TicketsQuick.Com in Indianapolis.</p>
        <p>But many of the city's larger ticket brokers reported that ticket-holders were still selling them their seats, even for Knicks fans.</p>
        <p>''Sure, we sell to anybody; we can't discriminate,'' Smith said.</p>
        <p>Smith said he was not surprised that many season ticket-holders had refused the Pacers' offer.</p>
        <p>''Fans paid a lot of money,'' he said. ''If they want to watch on TV or they can't make it, they want to make their money back.''</p>
        <p>One ticket broker, James Tucker, the owner of Premium Tickets, thought Rose's and Miller's concerns about the whole ticket situation were a meaningless distraction.</p>
        <p>''It's crazy that they're worrying about who's going to be in the stands before the biggest game of their life,'' Tucker said.</p>
        <p>One Tough Knick</p>
        <p>Latrell Sprewell's injury, an incomplete fracture of his fifth metatarsal in his right foot, did not keep him from playing in Game 4 on Monday. Nor did it it keep Pacers Coach Larry Bird from poking a little fun at him.</p>
        <p>''When I broke my foot it was just hanging there,'' Bird said. ''Obviously, Spree's a little tougher than I am because I couldn't have played on mine.''</p>
        <p>Bird then turned serious, saying: ''Spree's going to play; he's a player. He's one of those kids you wake him up at three o'clock in the morning and ask to play ball, he'll go.''</p>
        <p>Tonight, Sprewell shot 4 of 14 and was held to 10 points against a tenacious Pacers defense.</p>
        <p>O'Neal Rises Again</p>
        <p>The vote was finally unanimous for Shaquille O'Neal.</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles Lakers' center, who was one short of a unanimous vote in the balloting for the National Basketball Association's most valuable player award, became only the sixth player since 1982 to be a unanimous choice for the league's All-Star team.</p>
        <p>He was joined on the first team by Seattle's Gary Payton, Minnesota's Kevin Garnett, San Antonio's Tim Duncan and Jason Kidd of Phoenix.</p>
        <p>Karl Malone of Utah missed the first team for the first time since 1989. The results were announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>The only other unanimous choices in the last 18 seasons were Michael Jordan (four times), Larry Bird (three times), Malone (twice) and Magic Johnson and Charles Barkley (once each.)</p>
        <p>The team was selected by 121 writers and broadcasters who cover the league. (AP)</p>
