        <p>After more than two years of study, the federal government gave its approval yesterday for the construction of Hudson River Park, clearing what is probably the last major hurdle in the plan to create a ribbon of parkland along five miles of the Manhattan riverfront from Battery Park City to West 59th Street.</p>
        <p>The approval from the United States Army Corps of Engineers allows for construction to begin in the river itself, repairing the Civil War-era seawall and the 13 huge rotting piers that are the centerpiece of the plan.</p>

        <p>After more than two years of study, the federal government gave its approval yesterday for the construction of Hudson River Park, clearing what is probably the last major hurdle in the plan to create a ribbon of parkland along five miles of the Manhattan riverfront from Battery Park City to West 59th Street.</p>
        <p>The approval from the United States Army Corps of Engineers allows for construction to begin in the river itself, repairing the Civil War-era seawall and the 13 huge rotting piers that are the centerpiece of the plan.</p>
        <p>''The West Side of Manhattan, along with the rest of the city, has been looking forward to this park for a very long time,'' said Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who joined Gov. George E. Pataki at a news conference in Manhattan yesterday to announce that foundation work on the pilings in the river would begin as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>''The park will ensure that the Hudson River is part of our everyday lives,'' Governor Pataki said, ''not just as that waterway we see from the car.''</p>
        <p>Last September, the mayor and the governor opened the first phase of the park, running about 1,000 feet between West Houston and Bank Streets. When it is completed, scheduled for 2005, the park will have a continuous riverfront esplanade with lawns and flowers, bicycle and running trails and playgrounds.</p>
        <p>For supporters of the park, the last two years have been particularly suspenseful. The approval of the federal government was not a foregone conclusion, and the fate of the plan has been fiercely debated for the last 15 years.</p>
        <p>''We're New York City, and we have the crummiest waterfronts in the United States,'' said Albert K. Butzel, chairman of the Hudson River Park Alliance, a coalition of 35 community and environmental organizations that support the project. ''It's time to have a waterfront that celebrates the city, instead of the derelict waterfronts we have now.''</p>
        <p>But in the months to come, there will almost certainly be more legal challenges. Several national and local environmental organizations, including Friends of the Earth and the Clean Air Campaign, have long opposed the Hudson River Park and are threatening to sue. The park's opponents say that the many varieties of fish that migrate along that part of the Hudson, including striped bass and sturgeon, could be seriously harmed by construction work in the river. They say that a federal environmental impact study should be required for construction of this magnitude.</p>
        <p>''You never do a 550-acre project that includes 400 acres of fisheries without a federal environmental study,'' said Marcy Benstock, chairwoman of the Clean Air Campaign, which was instrumental in stopping the Westway highway project that the state planned to build along the Hudson waterfront during the 1980's. ''They're claiming it's a park, but it's really a development project.''</p>
        <p>Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth, a national environmental organization that also opposed Westway, said: ''This area is a key spot for more than a dozen fish that migrate up the river. They're trying to drape a park over it and say it will have no impact. These people have not a clue whatsoever.''</p>
        <p>But Joseph Seebode, chief of the regional branch of the Army Corps of Engineers, in New York, said that the state environmental impact study that had already been completed was exhaustive. He added that postponing the park's construction for two or three more years while a federal study was completed would have been repetitive and was unnecessary because the repair and reconstruction work would be confined to structures that already exist.</p>
        <p>The state environmental study and the Army's own investigation indicated that there would be ''minimal impact on the Hudson River itself and on the fisheries and wildlife,'' Mr. Seebode said.</p>
        <p>Before allowing the work to proceed, the Army Corps of Engineers held several public hearings and made significant changes in the initial plans. Plans for a marina were canceled, and many restrictions were added to protect the fish and their habitat. Dredging will not be allowed, and construction work will be forbidden during periods of heavy fish migration, Mr. Seebode said.</p>
        <p>While lawsuits are possible, many of the groups that challenged Westway have given their support to the Hudson River Park, including the National Marine Fisheries Service, which is part of the Commerce Department, and the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>''This park is the best guarantee for the fisheries,'' said Jim Tripp, a lawyer at Environmental Defense, a private environmental group. ''It's the best guarantee there will be green habitat along the Hudson River. There's tremendous commercial pressure to build on that waterfront. If you want to see hotels and retail there, don't allow this park to happen.''</p>
        <p>The Hudson River Park is expected to cost $330 million to $350 million. So far, $100 million has been set aside by the city and state. The state and city have pledged to provide at least another $120 million. The rest is to come from private donations.</p>
        <p>The plans include an esplanade and a bicycle trail running parallel to the riverbank. The parkland is to cover 550 acres. Of that, about 400 acres is the part of the river that stretches between the 13 piers on the West Side, and will be used for fishing and boating. The remaining 125 acres includes the narrow strip of land stretching from Battery Park City to West 59th Street, as well as the huge piers, some of which cover an area the size of several city blocks.</p>
        <p>Besides the existing passenger ship terminals and the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum, commercial development will be limited to the already-existing Chelsea Piers, a private gymnasium and recreation club, and to Pier 40, which is now a parking lot, said Noreen Doyle, vice president of the Hudson River Park Trust, the government agency that is in charge of planning and building the park.</p>
        <p>The park is the culmination of a 30-year effort to transform the rundown Hudson River waterfront into an asset instead of an eyesore. The struggle dates to the early 70's and the demise of the shipping industry, when the state took over the riverside from the Battery to Midtown to build a huge roadway called Westway. The highway drew vociferous objections, and opponents sued in federal courts, citing, among other problems, damage it could do to striped bass and other migrating fish.</p>
        <p>After the collapse of Westway, about 1986, the state and city governments convened a task force and started anew. The process was complicated by territorial problems -- the state owned the stretch from the Battery to 35th Street and the city owned the area north to 59th Street.</p>
        <p>In September 1998, Governor Pataki signed the state's longest and costliest urban waterfront park into law as a joint project between the city and the state. But the plans stalled again. It took nearly a year before the Hudson River Park Trust was created to manage the park's creation. Then came the long permitting process conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers, which ended yesterday.</p>
