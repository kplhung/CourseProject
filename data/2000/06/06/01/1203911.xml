        <p>Editorial on Federal Communications Commission plan to cut long-distance phone rates holds big savings for customers who make few such calls will bring benefits of deregulation to low-income families</p>

        <p>Telephone customers will soon begin to save money on their long-distance calls, courtesy of decisions made yesterday by the Federal Communications Commission. Families that make few long-distance calls will save the most under the commission's intricate ruling, as much as 50 percent -- a nice touch that brings the benefits of deregulation to low-income families. But buried among the regulatory rulings is something that should prove even more important to most customers in the long run. The commission wrung subsidies out of regulated rates that have kept prices too high and have stymied the outbreak of competition that Congress promised when it passed the 1996 Telecommunications Act.</p>
        <p>The issue the commission partially resolved yesterday concerns access charges -- regulated fees that local phone companies like Bell Atlantic are permitted to charge long-distance carriers like AT&amp;T for their use of the wire loops that Bell Atlantic runs into nearly everyone's home and business. The regional Bells and long-distance carriers have been fighting over access since the 1980's.</p>

        <p>Telephone customers will soon begin to save money on their long-distance calls, courtesy of decisions made yesterday by the Federal Communications Commission. Families that make few long-distance calls will save the most under the commission's intricate ruling, as much as 50 percent -- a nice touch that brings the benefits of deregulation to low-income families. But buried among the regulatory rulings is something that should prove even more important to most customers in the long run. The commission wrung subsidies out of regulated rates that have kept prices too high and have stymied the outbreak of competition that Congress promised when it passed the 1996 Telecommunications Act.</p>
        <p>The issue the commission partially resolved yesterday concerns access charges -- regulated fees that local phone companies like Bell Atlantic are permitted to charge long-distance carriers like AT&amp;T for their use of the wire loops that Bell Atlantic runs into nearly everyone's home and business. The regional Bells and long-distance carriers have been fighting over access since the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Some of the access charges cover the costs that rise as the length of individual calls rises. The most important decision the commission made yesterday was to cut these per-minute fees by about $2 billion a year -- roughly 4 percent of annual long-distance charges. This would bring these charges down from about five cents three years ago to about one penny per call, a level close to the actual costs that local companies incur when their loops are used. That, in turn, should allow the price of long-distance service to fall sharply, assuming the carriers pass the savings on to consumers as they have said they will. By matching prices to costs, the commission is doing all it can to create markets where the low-cost provider captures the most business.</p>
        <p>Another access charge covers the fixed cost of providing the loops -- costs that remain the same no matter how many calls are processed. Here the commission did little more than simplify billing. These charges currently appear on both local bills and the long-distance bills. But in the future the two will be combined into one charge on the local bill.  Families will pay less to their long-distance carrier, but more to the local company. The total will not change very much, causing consumer groups to criticize the commission for not making significant cuts. But the commission pledged to do a careful economic study in two years that will determine exactly how much customers need to pay to cover the true costs of maintaining the loops.</p>
        <p>The biggest winners yesterday will be families that in a given month make no or very few long-distance calls. Typically, carriers charge $3 a month for long-distance calls no matter how few are actually made. As part of the deal, some long-distance carriers promised to waive these minimum fees.</p>
        <p>The 1996 Telecommunications Act invited long-distance carriers into local service and local carriers into long-distance service. But so far, customers have reaped only modest benefits. Part of the problem has been a complicated regulatory system. Yesterday the commission simplified billing, brought charges in line with costs and provided a special boost to low-income families. Nothing dramatic will result from these steps for now. But over time they should foster competition, and the savings should mount.</p>
