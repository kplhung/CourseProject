        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I've been reading most of my news for the past few years online (''Reading the News in the Inkless World of Cyberspace,'' May 25). I spend about an hour reading news online every day. I still subscribe to one newspaper but canceled my subscription to the hard copy version of another one. I agree that you can read the paper anywhere, but the biggest advantage of reading online is the fact that you can send articles to others. Every Wednesday, I send e-mail to friends with food articles. If I don't, I get e-mail asking where they are. I recently discussed this exact issue with friends, and you can be assured that not only will they get a copy of the article, but this letter as well.</p>
