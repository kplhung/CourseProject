        <p>Ending weeks of speculation, the PGA Tour has decided to appeal to the United States Supreme Court a federal appeals court decision that allows Casey Martin to ride a cart in PGA Tour events, a lawyer for Martin said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The tour asked Justice Sandra Day O'Connor two weeks ago for a 60-day extension to file a petition to the court seeking a review of the case. O'Connor, herself a golfer, granted the tour an extension until July 5.</p>
        <p>Roy L. Reardon, Martin's lawyer, said: ''We opposed the tour's petition. They have seen Casey perform in a cart on both the Nike and PGA Tour. They can see he has no advantage over other players.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the tour said yesterday that the board of directors had discussed the Martin case at a meeting last week, but that the tour would make no immediate announcement on the matter. The tour's plans to appeal to the Supreme Court were first reported yesterday in The Washington Post.</p>
        <p>The tour cited a recent conflict between two federal appeals court decisions about golfers seeking to ride carts in professional competitions. ''These unsettled issues are substantial and of potentially widespread significance,'' the tour's lawyers wrote in seeking the extension. Although the Supreme Court takes only a small percentage of cases for review, one criterion for acceptance is a split in the circuit courts.</p>
        <p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco upheld a federal court decision in March, giving Martin the right to ride a cart. Martin, 27, has Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, a rare circulatory disorder, in his right leg. His lawsuit became the first to be filed by a professional athlete under the Americans With Disabilities Act. The tour mounted a vigorous challenge primarily on the grounds that walking is an essential part of high-level golf competition.</p>
        <p>As Martin's case went through the courts, Ford Olinger, a club pro from Indiana who has a degenerative hip, filed a lawsuit against the United States Golf Association seeking to use a cart to play qualifying events for the United States Open. Unlike the court in California, a three-member panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago ruled for the U.S.G.A. Olinger, 33, has appealed his case to the entire 11-member Seventh Circuit court. If he loses, his lawyer, John C. Hamilton, has said he will appeal to the Supreme Court as well.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a third case involving a Texas golfer seeking to use a cart to qualify for the United States Senior Open is now before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Austin, Tex.</p>
