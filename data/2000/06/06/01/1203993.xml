        <p>HE would listen in as the news media know-it-alls argued over dinner, the debate raging over the establishment of the half-court game against the need to get out and run. Twenty years ago, the extreme strategic positions were all the source of comic amusement to the sagacious basketball lifer.</p>
        <p>Red Holzman would invariably begin his arbitration with a perfectly timed heh-heh, and then he would say, ''Fellas, basketball is basketball.'' Which was his way of sermonizing that the game was no more a track meet than it was a tractor pull. It was and always would be about execution and effort, about reacting to the moment at hand.</p>
        <p>You can pretty much guarantee that the team seeking to redefine itself in the playoffs is the team that lost the last game. So the Pacers, back home at Conseco Fieldhouse last night, were suddenly enveloped in the same identity crisis the Knicks have often mired themselves in on successive playoff campaigns.</p>
        <p>''I saw what Larry Bird said, 'When you lose, the players always say you should do something else,' '' Jeff Van Gundy said before the Pacers shocked the Knicks, rallying in a hurry from 18 down in the first half and winning Game 5, 88-79, for a 3-2 lead in the Eastern Conference finals.</p>
        <p>From management on down, the Pacers came into this game offering more propositions than a California voting booth. Ownership stooped to the bush-league level of begging ticket brokers to not supply the cast of Spike Lee's next film with prime courtside real estate. Yet the most troubling of signs were the complaints that this series was slipping away because the coach, Bird, was holding back youth and speed.</p>
        <p>''Of course, you want to push the ball when you get the opportunity,'' said Van Gundy, so familiar with these particular charges. ''But how many easy baskets you get stems from how you defend and how you rebound.''</p>
        <p>Basketball, fellas, is basketball, and it wasn't until the Pacers were about to be run and booed out of their own gym that they reached down for something few people in the building thought they had. They played defense like their playoff lives depended on it. They were in a state of despair, losing 37-19 after Allan Houston hit a 3 with 10:42 left in the first half. Then it was if the script was torn up and tossed in the fire. The Knicks made one more field goal the rest of the half. They shot 1 for 15. They went off trailing 42-40, a 23-3 Indiana run.</p>
        <p>The notion that this occurred because Patrick Ewing returned to the lineup is absurd. Rik Smits practically begged for him to play and Ewing clinically abused him as the Knicks built the 18-point lead. Ewing was on the bench when the Knicks' drought started, when the Pacers stopped worrying about expectations and conspiracies and responded to the moment at hand.</p>
        <p>''Bottom line, they outworked us,'' Latrell Sprewell said.</p>
        <p>In the half-court and in transition and on the boards. In one telling sequence, Dale Davis ripped down successive Reggie Miller 3-point misfires, and the third try, with the ball in Travis Best's hands, was the charm.</p>
        <p>The Knicks scored a grand total of 23 points in the middle quarters. The Pacers' point guards, Mark Jackson and Best, played the second half with a vengeance -- a combined 35 points, 10 assists and no turnovers. Jackson couldn't stop himself from showboating, Larry Johnson-style, crossing his arms, ''thanking God,'' whenever he scored.</p>
        <p>L. J., by the way, was the latest of the Knicks' ''game-time decisions,'' showing up with a sore right foot. These Knicks' injury reports are becoming stranger than fiction, but this time the Pacers read nothing into it. The series was in their hands last Saturday when Marcus Camby went out with his sprained knee, and they were overwhelmed with their best opportunity there for the taking.</p>
        <p>Would the Knicks allow them another? Finally, because a championship demands no less, the Pacers made their own, reconstructing the bridge to the finals, defensive stop by stop, Knick brick by brick.</p>
        <p>''The only way we were going to get into it was with our defense,'' Miller said.</p>
        <p>Do the Pacers really believe they can beat these Knicks, who have lived so long on the edge that they actually consider it a comfort zone? Can they cross the bridge? Hard to say, but the Pacers were as out on their feet in the second quarter as the Knicks were Saturday in New York. A year ago, the Knicks won a very similar Game 5 against the Pacers. As they well know, cheating death can be carried a long, long way.</p>
