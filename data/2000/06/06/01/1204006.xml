        <p>''What Do You Mean, 'It's Just Like a Real Dog' '' (May 25), about robotic pets and children's reactions to them, and other articles in Circuits seem to show that we are rushing headlong into a new form of culture. It is going so fast that anyone raising questions about the long-term effects of becoming a technology-driven society is effectively ''run over.''</p>
        <p>I feel Circuits is overly promotional in tone for the new technology --  some of which, I must admit, is very exciting. But I see no reason why that should not be balanced by the views of sophisticated skeptics. As we continue to make this shift, everything could be seriously questioned. For example, think about the loss of letters we used to send one another and save. If nothing else, there should be someone at least marking the things that are lost in the rush into the technological world.</p>
