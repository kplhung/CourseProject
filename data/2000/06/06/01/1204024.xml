        <p>Savante Stringfellow of Mississippi upset the favored Melvin Lister of Arkansas in the men's long jump yesterday as the National Collegiate Athletic Association track and field championships got under way.</p>
        <p>Stringfellow, who has traded victories with Lister, his Southeastern Conference rival, over the past two years, took the lead for good with the first jump of the competition, 26 feet 8i inches, improving to 26-9 on his fourth attempt.</p>
        <p>Lister, whose 27-10 is the best in the world this year, fouled on his first jump and never got untracked. He finished fourth with 26-0.</p>
        <p>Florence Ezeh of France, a junior at Southern Methodist University, set a meet record in winning the women's hammer throw at 211-10.</p>
        <p>Gabor Mate and Reedus Thurmond of Auburn finished first and third in the discus throw.</p>
