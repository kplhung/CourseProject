        <p>Mike Piazza knelt at home plate, his hand clutching his head as blood streamed down his forehead. Moments earlier, Kevin Brown had been hopping around in foul territory, his right leg hobbled by a vicious line drive.</p>
        <p>In one inning of tonight's 4-3 Dodgers victory, won on a solo home run by Kevin Elster off Turk Wendell, the Mets and the Dodgers each lost their most celebrated player.</p>
        <p>Piazza, the Mets' catcher, was removed in the sixth after Gary Sheffield's backswing smashed him in the forehead. The Mets said Piazza sustained a slight concussion and a cut on his forehead, which required one stitch to close. Piazza was expected to play in the Mets' next game, at home against Tampa Bay on Friday.</p>
        <p>With one out in the bottom of the sixth, Sheffield fouled off a pitch from Mike Hampton and his bat slammed into Piazza's forehead as he finished his swing. The Mets trainer Fred Hina examined Piazza, who was immediately removed and replaced by Todd Pratt.</p>
        <p>Brown's leg was smashed by an Edgardo Alfonzo liner, the ball ricocheting toward the first-base line. Brown raced over, barehanded the ball and sidearmed his throw as he fell, like Robin Ventura fielding a bunt.</p>
        <p>But Brown stumbled getting up, and he limped back to the mound. A trainer and teammates crowded around, but Brown stayed in to retire Piazza and end the inning. He could not continue and was relieved by Alan Mills.</p>
        <p>The loss of the two superstars overshadowed the game, which concluded a rigorous road trip for the Mets.</p>
        <p>Trailing by 3-1, the Mets got a leadoff homer in the eighth from shortstop Kurt Abbott, who had not driven in a run this season. With one out and two on, Alfonzo lined a double off the short wall in right field, missing a homer by a foot but tying the score, 3-3.</p>
        <p>The game featured a matchup of two of the National League's premier pitchers, Brown and two of the National League's premier pitchers, Brown and Hampton. Brown allowed a solo homer to Alfonzo in the first inning Hampton. Brown allowed a solo homer to Alfonzo in the first inning and just two other hits in his final five innings.</p>
        <p>Hampton pitched well, permitting only five hits in seven innings.</p>
        <p>Chad Kreuter opened the third with a homer to tie the score, 1-1. In the fourth, Shawn Green's liner grazed the glove of Mets shortstop Kurt Abbott, with Mark Grudzielanek running off second. A double-play ball turned into a run-scoring single and the Dodgers led, 2-1.</p>
