        <p>Letter by Elizabeth Shabel respondws to Michelle Slatalla's May 25 article on how much free shipping is worth when ordering online</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I congratulate Michelle Slatalla on her selection of the Pawleys Island hammock as her hammock of choice (''Finding Out How Much Free Shipping Is Worth,'' Online Shopper, May 25). I'm from New Hampshire but grew up in South Carolina, so I know firsthand about Pawleys Island hammocks.</p>
        <p>I remember well our summers at Floral Beach (now known as Surfside Beach) in South Carolina in the 1940's. Three things we did with regularity during those summers: visit Mr. Eason's store and post office in Murrel's Inlet, eat seafood at Lee's Kitchen there and go to Mr. Lachicotte's hammock shop at Pawleys Island to watch the folks weave the hammocks -- and sometimes to buy one.</p>

        <p>South Carolina's neighbor, North Carolina, may have more action and more intellectual areas, but darlin', it will never have the ambience, the history, the customs, the beauty, and the lore and crafts that South Carolina does. There is a Cape Hatteras hammock, but it's a Johnny-come-lately. We should give credit to the people of South Carolina for the pleasures we all have derived from those lazy hammock hours.</p>
