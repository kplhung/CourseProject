        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''To Prepare for Worst, Back Up'' (State of the Art, May 18): On May 18, lightning from a big thunderstorm took out two of my modems and one entire hard drive. It was a rather rude awakening, to say the least. So the recent article about making backups was most timely for me. I was using conventional Zip disks for backing up, which served me just fine. But when the majority of the letters in response to the article suggested a second hard drive for backing up, my warning bells and whistles all went off! How awful all of those folks would feel if they suffered what I just went through.  Seems to me that backing up work on a hard drive that sits inside a potential lightning-will-hit-me-someday computer is not prudent.</p>
