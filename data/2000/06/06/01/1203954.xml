        <p>Todd Pratt paused as he reached home plate, milking one last moment out of the longest nine-inning game in Mets history. Pratt lifted his knee and pounded his cleats into the plate, as if stuffing trash deeper into a wastebasket. Tuesday night's game may have been a mess from a pure baseball standpoint, but it was lovely for the Mets.</p>
        <p>For the first time this season, the team came back to win after trailing after eight innings. It took 4 hours 9 minutes -- just 13 minutes short of the nine-inning record set by the Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles in 1997 -- but the Mets outlasted the Los Angeles Dodgers, 10-5, with Pratt busting things open with a pinch-hit grand slam in the ninth. Melvin Mora had driven in the go-ahead run one batter earlier with a bases-loaded walk off Terry Adams.</p>

        <p>Todd Pratt paused as he reached home plate, milking one last moment out of the longest nine-inning game in Mets history.

Tuesday night's game may have been a mess from a pure baseball standpoint, but it was lovely for the Mets.</p>
        <p>For the first time this season, the team came back to win after trailing after eight innings. It took 4 hours 9 minutes -- just 13 minutes short of the nine-inning record set by the Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles in 1997 -- but the Mets outlasted the Los Angeles Dodgers, 10-5, with Pratt busting things open with a pinch-hit grand slam in the ninth. Melvin Mora had driven in the go-ahead run one batter earlier with a bases-loaded walk off Terry Adams.</p>
        <p>''I just wanted to drink a beer,'' Pratt said. ''I wanted to get it over with.''</p>
        <p>Mora had a memorable return from Class AAA Norfolk. The utility man was scheduled to catch Tuesday for Norfolk against the Durham Bulls. He was surprised when reporters told him -- he had not caught since 1995.</p>
        <p>When he arrived at Dodger Stadium Tuesday, Mora found himself in another unfamiliar role. For only the second time this season, he was batting leadoff. Mora had come off the disabled list to replace shortstop Rey Ordonez, who broke a bone in his left forearm Monday.</p>
        <p>Mora singled to lead off the game, stole second and scored on the first of three hits by Edgardo Alfonzo. Mora also walked in the fourth, loading the bases in a rally that produced no runs, and singled and scored in the sixth before his go-ahead walk in the ninth.</p>
        <p>In all, he was 2 for 4 with three runs scored. And he did not strike out. Before going on the disabled list May 13 with a lacerated right index finger, Mora was averaging a strikeout every 2.94 at-bats.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The starting pitcher RICK REED (strained muscle) threw in the outfield before Wednesday's game, and the Mets do not believe he will need to go on the disabled list.</p>
