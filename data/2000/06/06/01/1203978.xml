        <p>As the Pacers walked off the court at halftime tonight with an improbable 42-40 lead, Reggie Miller slapped the sweat off Travis Best's scorching hand with more force and more emotion than Indiana had displayed since the opening game of the Eastern Conference finals at Conseco Fieldhouse.</p>
        <p>With 2 minutes 36 seconds left in Indiana's 88-79 victory in Game 5 over the Knicks, after Best had given the Pacers a game-deciding 11-point lead, Mark Jackson hugged Best, his protege and backup point guard.</p>
        <p>The blood was pulsing throughout the Pacers again and it started to flow from Indiana's backcourt, specifically from two point guards.</p>
        <p>One young and speedy, the other experienced and deliberate. But together they were a tag team that was tired of hearing all about how the Knicks' Charlie Ward had outplayed them this series. They had something to prove tonight and they did.</p>
        <p>Best scored a career playoff-high 24 points to lead the Pacers, contributing 15 in the fourth quarter alone and 8 in the second quarter, equal too the Knicks' total.</p>
        <p>While he was the catalyst for the Pacers' 18-point comeback, Jackson scored 8 of his 11 points in the third quarter to preserve a tenuous lead and to put Indiana only one victory away from the National Basketball Association finals.</p>
        <p>''We took it kind of personally,'' Best said. ''We knew during the season we could outplay most of the guards we faced and a situation so important as this, you don't want to be outplayed now. I just tried to be aggressive.''</p>
        <p>''Travis was spectacular, aggressive,'' Jackson said. ''He just had a great offensive night.'' He added with a laugh about the bench, ''It always seems like when I do something, he goes out of his way to keep me there.''</p>
        <p>But there were no complaints from either of them, or their teammates. ''So much talk has been about Charlie Ward about how he had been dominating our point guards, they took it personal and wanted to do something about it,'' said Miller, who had 16 points last night.</p>
        <p>''I give Travis a lot of credit, he was the one who got us into the bonus quickly in the fourth quarter because of his penetrating and making layups. That was big for us.''</p>
        <p>But before the Pacers could even be in position to close out the game with free throws, they faced a seemingly insurmountable challenge. Once again, for the third straight game this series, they had a shockingly slow start in the first quarter and created for themselves a huge challenge of an 18-point deficit.</p>
        <p>But with stingier defense and more speed on the floor with Best, the Pacers began to chip away at the lead. When Best made a 3-pointer with one minute to play in the half, he had nearly completed the comeback, bringing the Pacers within 3 points, 40-37. With six seconds remaining, he sunk two foul shots to give Indiana its first lead.</p>
        <p>They would never trail again. ''It's a great feeling to be one game away from going to the championship,'' Best said. ''We're in a good position right now and we want to take advantage of it. This game feels good right now.''</p>
        <p>Jackson, too, was smiling after the game. Like Larry Johnson making the signal of the ''Big L,'' Jackson had decided late Tuesday night, after watching the Trail Blazers beat the Lakers in the Western Conference finals, that he was make an on-court signal to celebrate a big shot.</p>
        <p>Jackson was angry. He was tired of hearing he was too old and his talent, after 13 years in the league, had faded. He was angry that people were counting the Pacers out.</p>
        <p>''I was watching TV and I was upset,'' he said. ''I wanted to do something to energize the team.</p>
        <p>He decided, not in response to Johnson, but in response to his faith, to make the sign of a cross whenever he hit a big shot. ''This was do or die, this was a sense of urgency,'' Jackson said.</p>
        <p>''They were excellent tonight,'' Pacers Coach Larry Bird said. ''Travis came in and gave us a big lift, then Mark came in in the third quarter and did a great job. Then Travis finished the game for us.''</p>
        <p>Best, who averaged 5.4 points a game in three seasons of Pacers' playoffs, and was averaging just 8.8 points a game in this series, exploded for the biggest game of his career. He added six rebounds, no turnovers and, despite his 5-foot-11-inch frame, even blocked a shot. He could not have done it without Jackson, who had seven assists and no turnovers.</p>
        <p>''He's such a smart player and person he really helped me out the last couple of years,'' Best said. ''It was tough sitting on the bench, but at the same time I watched and learned from him and now this is a situation where we both had a great game.''</p>
