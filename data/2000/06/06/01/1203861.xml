        <p>Out of Africa</p>
        <p>Billed as the nation's first dance festival devoted solely to the legacy of African dance, DanceAfrica returns for a 23rd season at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, with music tonight in the Bamcafe. Dance begins at 7:30 tomorrow night in the BAM Howard Gilman Opera House, with the New York debut of Genies Noirs from Benin and appearances by the West African Djoule African, the hip-hop of Rennie Harris Puremovement and the student dancers of the BAM/Restoration DanceAfrica Ensemble. There are four more performances through Sunday and the festival continues through Monday with films in the Bamcinematek and a weekend bazaar.</p>
        <p>Time Warp</p>
        <p>Perhaps ahead of its time, but there once was a television show about a Fernwood, Ohio, housewife concerned with waxy yellow buildup on her kitchen floor, mass murder in her neighborhood, her troubled marriage, her insolent daughter and a grandfather known as the Fernwood Flasher. The time was 1976, and after the networks turned down this combination of soap opera and spoof of soap operas, produced by Norman Lear, as unsuitable for prime time, it went on the air as a syndicated series. Mostly seen late at night after the local news, it was ''Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,'' and its star was Louise Lasser. All 325 episodes of the show will be shown tomorrow through Sept. 16 at the Museum of Television and Radio at 25 West 52nd Street in Manhattan and from June 16 through Sept. 17 at the museum in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Together Again</p>
        <p>Twenty-one years ago, on a memorable occasion in American jazz, the drummer and composer Max Roach and the pianist and composer Cecil Taylor appeared for the first time in the United States as a duet. The site was the campus of Columbia University. And there they will return at 6 p.m. on Sunday for a performance on Low Plaza at Broadway and 116th Street in Morningside Heights. The concert, part of the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival with the Center for Jazz Studies as host, will include the David S. Ware Quartet, the Joey Baron and Ron Carter Duo and the La Guardia High School Jazz Band.</p>
        <p>Going Strong</p>
        <p>The Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson Trio made its debut at the White House for President Jimmy Carter's inauguration in January 1977. One of the few chamber music ensembles to retain its original members, the trio, consisting of the pianist Joseph Kalichstein, the violinist Jaime Laredo and the cellist Sharon Robinson, will usher in the 50th anniversary season of the Hudson Valley Chamber Music Circle with a performance of Beethoven and Brahms at 8 on Saturday night in Olin Hall at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., preceded at 7 by discussions led by the musicians.</p>
