        <p>Editorial on downfall of Israeli Pres Ezer Weizman for accepting illegal political contributions recalls his contributions to Israeli public life, including key support for peace efforts; holds Shimon Peres would make worthy successor</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Ezer Weizman is justly admired for his many contributions to Israeli public life, including crucial support for peace efforts with Egypt and the Palestinians. But a withering government report detailing his receipt of more than $300,000 from two businessmen a decade ago left him little choice but to resign from the largely ceremonial office of president effective July 10. Appropriately, the leading choice to succeed him is another man closely identified with the quest for Mideast peace, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weizman's downfall brings a notable career to a sad end. As air force commander he helped lead Israel to victory in the 1967 war. Entering politics, he joined Menachem Begin's conservative Likud government as defense minister and played a major role in the diplomacy leading to the Camp David agreement and the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt, Israel's first with any Arab nation. He later joined the Labor Party and, with its support, became president in 1993. Stretching the limited powers of that office, he became an independent-minded advocate for peace, challenging the policies of Labor as well as Likud governments and becoming popular with the Israeli public.</p>

        <p>Ezer Weizman is justly admired for his many contributions to Israeli public life, including crucial support for peace efforts with Egypt and the Palestinians. But a withering government report detailing his receipt of more than $300,000 from two businessmen a decade ago left him little choice but to resign from the largely ceremonial office of president effective July 10. Appropriately, the leading choice to succeed him is another man closely identified with the quest for Mideast peace, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weizman's downfall brings a notable career to a sad end. As air force commander he helped lead Israel to victory in the 1967 war. Entering politics, he joined Menachem Begin's conservative Likud government as defense minister and played a major role in the diplomacy leading to the Camp David agreement and the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt, Israel's first with any Arab nation. He later joined the Labor Party and, with its support, became president in 1993. Stretching the limited powers of that office, he became an independent-minded advocate for peace, challenging the policies of Labor as well as Likud governments and becoming popular with the Israeli public.</p>
        <p>But it turns out that Mr. Weizman was not quite as independent as he seemed. The illegal political contributions he secretly accepted were, by his own acknowledgment, efforts to buy influence with a rising political star. Had the statute of limitations not run out, Mr. Weizman could have faced criminal charges of bribery.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peres would make a worthy successor, given his broad experience and his close personal identification with the peace process. Awarded a share of the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in negotiating the 1993 Oslo peace agreements, he became prime minister after the assassination of his fellow laureate Yitzhak Rabin in 1995. Since then Mr. Peres has sometimes been seen as an intra-party rival to Prime Minister Ehud Barak. But Mr. Barak was smart to pick him as the candidate of his majority coalition when Parliament chooses a new president on July 31.</p>
        <p>The move will help reinforce the coalition's unity for the challenging months ahead. Israel must find ways to stabilize its border with Lebanon in the wake of its rushed withdrawal last week and the movement of Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas to the international frontier. It also faces possible new tensions with Syria over Lebanon and the Golan Heights while trying to meet a September target date for negotiating a final peace agreement with the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak will discuss all three of these peace issues with President Clinton when the two meet in Portugal today. The questions still to be resolved with the Palestinians and Syria are difficult but have by now been clearly defined. With enough will on all sides, they can be bridged. It would be fitting for Mr. Peres, as a newly installed president, to participate in completing the peace agreements he envisioned and helped design.</p>
