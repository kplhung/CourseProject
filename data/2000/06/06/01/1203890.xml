        <p>A rigorous, large-scale evaluation of changes in welfare in Minnesota has found extremely positive effects: higher earnings and income for parents, less poverty, an increase in marriage rates and marital stability and improvements in children's behavior and school performance -- a combination never seen before.</p>
        <p>Results of the study, issued today by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research center, were hailed by conservatives and liberals alike.</p>
        <p>They said the study provided the first firm evidence that changes in welfare policies could lead to increases in marriage and marital stability, a central goal of many people who rewrote federal and state welfare laws in the last decade.</p>
        <p>Gordon L. Berlin, senior vice president of the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, said, ''The Minnesota Family Investment Program produced substantial, far-ranging improvements in the lives of single parents who were long-term welfare recipients.''</p>
        <p>Minnesota required welfare recipients to work, but allowed them to continue receiving modest amounts of cash assistance at the same time. Minnesota's program was more generous than those of most other states, and more expensive, but it was also more effective in achieving the stated goals of the federal welfare law signed by President Clinton in 1996.</p>
        <p>In Minnesota, welfare workers went out of their way to emphasize that if welfare recipients took jobs, even low-wage jobs, they would be financially better off than if they stayed on welfare. When a person took a job, the state would not count 38 percent of monthly earnings in calculating the amount of cash assistance. This policy was intended as an incentive for people to work.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Michael T. O'Keefe, commissioner of human services in Minnesota, said: ''One of the longstanding criticisms of the old welfare program was that it broke up families. This new study provides the first solid evidence that a welfare system focused on employment can stabilize families and improve the well-being of children.''</p>
        <p>The investigators said they were surprised by the size of the changes they found in the last few years:</p>
        <p>*The proportion of welfare recipients with jobs rose by 35 percent, and many of the jobs provided stable full-time work. (Half of single parents worked under the new welfare program, compared with 37 percent under the old program.)</p>
        <p>*Earnings increased by 23 percent, to an average of nearly $8,000 a year for each person working.</p>
        <p>*Average income, from earnings and welfare combined, rose 15 percent, to $10,800 a year.</p>
        <p>*The proportion of welfare recipients with health insurance coverage rose to 69 percent, from 61 percent.</p>
        <p>''These changes led to remarkable changes in family life,'' the report said. Domestic abuse decreased by 18 percent, marriage rates increased by 50 percent, and parents said their children performed better in school and had fewer behavior problems.</p>
        <p>The results were achieved in a robust economy, when unemployment is low. Economists say the real test of the new programs could come in an economic downturn.</p>
        <p>The results raise questions for conservatives, who have tried to get poor people off welfare and into jobs as fast as possible. One such question is how much extra they are willing to spend to achieve other goals, like an increase in marriage and a reduction in separation and divorce.</p>
        <p>Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, said the findings vindicated the welfare strategy of Republicans in Congress, who encouraged marriage as one of the explicit goals of the 1996 welfare law.</p>
        <p>''This study shows that if you mandate work, but couple it with a generous approach to welfare, you can increase employment, reduce poverty and -- most gratifying -- get more stable marriages with less violence between partners,'' Mrs. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>Current and former Clinton administration officials were delighted with the results.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we've seen anything quite like this before,'' said David T. Ellwood, a professor of political economy at Harvard, who was a top welfare official in the administration from 1993 to 1995.</p>
        <p>Olivia A. Golden, an assistant secretary of health and human services,  said the Minnesota study was ''enormously important.''</p>
        <p>Minnesota not only required welfare recipients to take jobs quickly, as most other states have done, but spent additional money to encourage the formation of two-parent families, Ms. Golden said.</p>
        <p>''Never before have we seen such clear evidence that more families became or stayed married,'' she said. ''Never before have we seen that the rates of women experiencing domestic violence decreased from a welfare program.''</p>
        <p>Lisa A. Gennetian, a co-author of the report, said, ''In Minnesota, we found the first strong evidence that changing the rules of the welfare system can actually increase the likelihood that single parents get married and that two-parent families stay together.''</p>
