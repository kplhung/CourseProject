        <p>After having kept a low profile on the campaign trail in recent months, Tipper Gore, the wife of Vice President Al Gore, emerged today in the kind of setting where she clearly feels most comfortable: a forum on mental health policy.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gore has never seemed to relish life on the campaign trail, trying to maintain her privacy beyond the glare of the public spotlight trained on her husband.

        <p>After having kept a low profile on the campaign trail in recent months, Tipper Gore, the wife of Vice President Al Gore, emerged today in the kind of setting where she clearly feels most comfortable: a forum on mental health policy.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gore has never seemed to relish life on the campaign trail, trying to maintain her privacy beyond the glare of the public spotlight trained on her husband. ''I think the way for people to understand me the best is for you to understand that I'm not really of the political milieu,'' she told a reporter last year.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Gore has also taken an increasingly public role as an advocate for mental health care, serving as an adviser to President Clinton and helping to organize the first White House Conference on Mental Health last year.</p>
        <p>So today's appearance before a group of mental health professionals in suburban Washington, where she shared a stage and a microphone with her husband, offered the perfect blending of politics and policy, an opportunity to promote her pet issue and her husband's candidacy.</p>
        <p>''We need a president who understands the importance of health care and mental health care,'' she told the crowd.</p>
        <p>Her husband, she added, did not just care about mental health in the abstract. ''He has lived it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>That was a reference to Mrs. Gore's own battle with depression, which she disclosed in a newspaper article a year ago. In the article, Mrs. Gore said she had been treated for depression after the couple's 6-year-old son was severely injured in an automobile accident in 1989.</p>
        <p>Her aides say she is no longer under treatment.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mrs. Gore, who received a master's degree in psychology from Vanderbilt University, described the disclosure of her depression as a liberating experience.</p>
        <p>Since then, she said, people including flight attendants and members of Congress have told her that she had helped them discuss their mental problems openly.</p>
        <p>''The way I've been treated differently,'' Mrs. Gore said, ''is people approaching me, being happy, being joyful and open, saying, 'Thank you, thank you.' ''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gore's appearance today fit neatly into efforts by her husband's campaign this week to cast the vice president, who has come under criticism from some Democrats as overly negative on the stump, in a more positive, family-oriented light.</p>
        <p>But both the vice president and his wife bristled at the suggestion that today's event was in any way choreographed by his advisers.</p>
        <p>''This event's been planned for months,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>Throughout the event, and then during the joint interview, the Gores were a picture of mutual solicitousness, stepping out of each other's way in answering questions and praising each other's commitment to the issue.</p>
        <p>''You should know that I agree with everything she says,'' Mr. Gore said in the interview. Without missing a beat, Mrs. Gore remarked, ''But he sets the policy.''</p>
