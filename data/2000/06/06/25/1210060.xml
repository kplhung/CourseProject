        <p>CARTOONS are supposed to be funny, but at the Ross School in East Hampton, nobody was amused by one that turned up in April pillorying the private school's large-scale building plans in a special groundwater protection area.</p>
        <p>The school, envisioned by its benefactor and founder, Courtney Sale Ross, as a national center for innovative education, is serious business on the South Fork, where people hold strong opinions about whether the expansion should be allowed.</p>
        <p>The cartoon, commissioned by the Long Island Pine Barrens Society and drawn by Van Howell of Westhampton Beach, depicts students celebrating Earth Day while spouting inanities atop a bulldozer that is uprooting trees on the school property.</p>
        <p>When the acerbic pen-and-ink rendering found its way into The East Hampton Star, the town's weekly newspaper, it unleashed a torrent of complaint from students and school officials.</p>
        <p>''It went beyond the pale,'' said Bertram Fields, a lawyer in Los Angeles and a board member and co-counsel to the school. ''It embarrassed the children, showing them as ugly little trolls riding a Rolls Royce bulldozer. It was cruel and unnecessary.''</p>
        <p>Last week Richard L. Amper, Jr., executive director of the Pine Barrens Society, said Mr. Fields and the school had gone too far by threatening to sue the society over the cartoon, as well as radio ads and public statements about the project that Mr. Fields said were filled with lies.</p>
        <p>''They are deliberately trying to intimidate us, but we won't cave in,'' said Mr. Amper, whose often confrontational style has set him apart from most other environmental activists on Long Island.</p>
        <p>In increasingly hostile correspondence between the society and Mr. Fields, Mr. Fields has hooted at the notion the society could be cowed. ''That's utter hogwash,'' he wrote. ''I'm sure I couldn't if I tried.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Amper said Mr. Fields's rumblings about legal action were more than idle threats. The cost of defending against a suit, he said, would drain the society's limited resources. In what appeared to be an attempt to stave off court action, Mr. Amper held a news conference on June 16 to clarify what the society had said -- and had not said, or had not said seriously -- about the Ross School project.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fields, who had demanded that the society retract what he called untruths about the size and impact of the project and defamatory attacks on Mrs. Ross in radio ads, chose to view the event as an apology. ''It is the end of the matter unless he does it again,'' Mr. Fields said last week.</p>
        <p>The radio ads feature a woman's voice asking if her audience is wearing slippers -- an allusion to the no-shoes policy in the Ross School's high-school building -- and saying, ''We must not allow drinking water protection to interfere with my 50-building empire in the woods.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Amper said the school was ignoring the satirical nature of the ads and was trying to brand him a liar to undermine the society's credibility. ''It is especially harmful to us when we are accused of being dishonest,'' he said. ''Our strength is our candor. People expect us to call things as they are.''</p>
        <p>The cartoon, Mr. Amper said, was not meant to savage students but to satirize a plan to undertake the largest building project in South Fork history in a state-designated groundwater recharge area.</p>
        <p>Clearing more than 31 wooded acres on a 133.5-acre parcel the school owns near the East Hampton airport would make way for 48 new buildings for the school and a companion institute, carrying on a mission that Mrs. Ross, widow of the Time Warner chairman Steven J. Ross, has said will take all of her time and much of her money.</p>
        <p>The 484,000-square-foot building project would be built over 10 years to accommodate more than 400 students in grades K through 12 and 300 faculty and staff members, some of whom would live on the campus.</p>
        <p>The property, zoned for industrial or commercial use, is nonetheless recognized by the town and the state as a groundwater recharge area.</p>
        <p>Daniel A. Ruzow, an environmental lawyer for the school, said the building plan left 77 percent, or 102 acres, of the site as woodland. He said a septic system would be located in an area with a thick soil layer to protect groundwater.</p>
        <p>Current zoning, he said, would allow far more intensive development.</p>
        <p>The Pine Barrens Society said the property should be purchased by government and protected from development. It said fragmentation of the woods would have the same effect as clearing more than 70 acres.</p>
        <p>The society has also criticized the town for not including site plan applications such as the school expansion in a six-month building moratorium that applies only to subdivisions in which a landowner seeks to divide land into parcels for development.</p>
        <p>Last week the town supervisor, Jay Schneiderman, a former teacher at the Ross School, said the town board would hold public hearings on extending the moratorium to site plans. He also said that the school expansion would undergo a very thorough review process in the planning board and that the school was compiling ''the most exhaustive environmental impact statement in the town's history.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schneiderman said he had not spoken to Mrs. Ross about selling her property to the town, and said it was not clear to him whether such a purchase would be the best use of land preservation funds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Amper called Mr. Schneiderman ''an apologist for his former employer'' and said the society ''never had a developer come at us like this in 23 years.''</p>
        <p>Wilbur F. Breslin, the president of Breslin Realty Development Corporation in Garden City, a major Long Island developer attacked by the society and other groups for clearing woods in Brookhaven two years ago for a yet-unbuilt mall, said suing the society ''would have been a futile effort.''</p>
        <p>''Our attorney told us we would be wasting our time,'' he said. ''These environmental groups are bullet-proof. You really can't go after them.''</p>
        <p>''I recommend they sit down and make a deal with them,'' he said. ''Litigation is going to get them nowhere.''</p>
        <p>John P. Scanlon of Sag Harbor, a public relations agent who is advising the school, said Mr. Amper's misrepresentation of the project and misuse of satire remained troubling. ''Satire is an entirely appropriate weapon, but it ought to be done by someone who knows how to do it,'' he said, adding that Mr. Amper ''certainly doesn't behave like the professionals I know in this field.''</p>
        <p>Robert A. Wieboldt, executive vice president of the Long Island Builders Institute, also criticized Mr. Amper's tactics but gave him grudging praise. ''He is a rigid propagandist, but a good one, you've got to admit,'' he said. ''All he has to do is make a phone call and he gets wonderful coverage, but at what expense?''</p>
        <p>Edwin M. Schwenk of Southampton, another former adversary who later teamed up with Mr. Amper to oppose South Fork development, said: ''The tenacity of the individual, the aggressiveness can never be faulted. The pine barrens preserve never would have happened without him.''</p>
        <p>Other environmental groups admire Mr. Amper, but use more restrained methods, in part to avoid lawsuits.</p>
        <p>''We're not quite as flamboyant,'' said Marilyn E. England, president of the Open Space Council in Brookhaven. ''But you need both approaches. You need people like Dick Amper to stand up. It's kind of good cop, bad cop.''</p>
        <p>There was even measured support from the Ross School. ''I respect Dick Amper,'' said Andi O'Hearn, its director of external affairs. ''We just want him to stick to the truth.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Howell, who has lampooned Mr. Amper, Mr. Breslin and a catalog of other public figures in a long career as a cartoonist and publisher of alternative newspapers, said the school was being thin-skinned. ''They have to learn how to take a joke,'' he said.</p>
