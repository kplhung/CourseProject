        <p>MADISON AVENUE likes to believe that advertising truly reflects our culture's disposition. On Wednesday evening, at the New Haven Gay and Lesbian Community Center, Michael Wilke will show how marketing lags behind other media in a 90-minute presentation called ''Commercial Closet,'' a history of television advertising with gay and lesbian themes. The presentation is part of the International Festival of Arts and Ideas and admission is free.</p>
        <p>''The advertising industry likes to think of itself as a mirror of society but, in fact, it's a blurred mirror at best,'' said Mr. Wilke. ''The business is rather behind the times in its inclusions of minorities, including Asians, Hispanics, biracial couples, disabled persons and, of course, lesbians and gays. In the realm of media, advertising is behind all others, including film and television, which have already dealt with the subject extensively for years.''</p>

        <p>MADISON AVENUE likes to believe that advertising truly reflects our culture's disposition. On Wednesday evening, at the New Haven Gay and Lesbian Community Center, Michael Wilke will show how marketing lags behind other media in a 90-minute presentation called ''Commercial Closet,'' a history of television advertising with gay and lesbian themes. The presentation is part of the International Festival of Arts and Ideas and admission is free.</p>
        <p>''The advertising industry likes to think of itself as a mirror of society but, in fact, it's a blurred mirror at best,'' said Mr. Wilke. ''The business is rather behind the times in its inclusions of minorities, including Asians, Hispanics, biracial couples, disabled persons and, of course, lesbians and gays. In the realm of media, advertising is behind all others, including film and television, which have already dealt with the subject extensively for years.''</p>
        <p>The Commercial Closet features more than 100 advertisements from the United States, Britain, the Czech Republic, Australia, Canada and Brazil. Mr. Wilke examines television advertising from the 1950's when women were busying themselves in the kitchen and gay people seemed nonexistent. The commercials show that, up until recently, gay themes and characters existed only for shock or comic effect, as in the  1974 commercial featuring the football icon Joe Namath donning pantyhose.</p>
        <p>''The outrageous ones tend to be cross-dressing or transgendered ads that are much more accepted than gay ads,'' said Mr. Wilke, whose archive of advertising -- it numbers 180-plus images -- will appear by mid-summer on his Web site (www.commercialcloset.com).</p>
        <p>''Bud Light aired a widely-remembered spot,'' Mr. Wilke said, ''where a bunch of guys from an office dressed up as women to get discounts for ladies' night at the bar. Dunkin' Donuts once had Fred the Baker -- the 'gotta make the donuts guy' -- wearing a dress, and covering his mustache with his finger, to spy on the competition. There are even more outrageous ones from Europe.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilke first presented his lecture at the New York Lesbian and Gay Film Festival in 1997. He has since presented it at more than 30 film festivals, university seminars and, most recently, at the Turin International Film Festival in Italy. He is currently making a documentary film version on the subject.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilke said that Wednesday's presentation in New Haven will consist of a mixture of video and lecture. Among 11 sections are ones entitled ''Hustlers, Queens, Pornographers, Murderers and Pedophiles,'' ''Gay Vague,'' ''(Straight) Dude Looks Like a Lady'' and ''Lesbian Chic.''  Political commercials in the local and national battles for gay civil rights will also be included.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Wilke aims his presentation at a general audience, he said that gay audiences are more vocal in their appreciation for its humor. ''Straight audiences,'' he said ''tend to be more serious and laugh much less, which is a shame because the ads are truly entertaining even if they aren't all positive in their handling of the material. For lesbians and gays, I think, it's an eye-opener to see the volume of material that represents us, because so little of it is widely seen.''</p>
        <p>The door to the commercial closet,  Mr. Wilke said, has opened dramatically in the last five years and continues to show signs of opening even wider. The more tolerant society becomes of gay men and lesbians, the funnier the attitudes reflected in these early commercials appear.</p>
        <p>''The irony to this so far is that gays are being used for their shock value in ads,'' Mr. Wilke said, ''for humor, or at least something different. At some point, they will reach the point of being a bit dull and may just appear in more mundane inclusions as a part of our diverse society.''</p>
        <p>The Commercial Closet, a history of television advertising with gay and lesbian themes, will be presented as part of the International Festival of Arts and Ideas at 8 p.m. on Wednesday at the New Haven Gay and Lesbian Community Center, 50 Fitch Street, New Haven. Admission is free. The number to call for more information is 888-ART-IDEA or one can visit the festival's Web site (www.artidea.org).</p>
