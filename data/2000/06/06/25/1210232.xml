        <p>WHAT we have here is a failure to communicate.</p>
        <p>I am sitting in the Buick LaCrosse concept car, a design study for an elegant, futuristic sedan, at General Motors' proving grounds here. And like Paul Newman in the ''Cool Hand Luke'' chain gang, it looks as though I won't be getting out soon.</p>
        <p>The LaCrosse's features include voice-activated controls. After a brief and very gentle drive with Gary Mack, one of the car's designers, as I conversed with the car in an attempt to make my exit, I had the distinct sense that I was dealing with HAL, the control-freak computer in ''2001: A Space Odyssey.'' This is what happened:</p>
        <p>Me: LaCrosse, door open.</p>
        <p>LaCrosse: (Silence.)</p>
        <p>Me: LaCrosse, door open.</p>
        <p>LaCrosse: Dialing 921.</p>
        <p>Me: LaCrosse, door open.</p>
        <p>LaCrosse: Out of range.</p>
        <p>Mack: Try ''Door open.''</p>
        <p>Me: Door open.</p>
        <p>LaCrosse: Opening hood.</p>
        <p>Mack (quickly trying to take over as the hood starts to rise), loudly: Hood close!</p>
        <p>It is an extremely windy day and the prospect that the fragile, hand-built hood will fly open panics three of the car's handlers and sends them running our way.</p>
        <p>A G.M. representative: No. No. No. It's too windy! It'll become a sail!</p>
        <p>Mack: Hood close.</p>
        <p>LaCrosse: Temperature set 79 degrees.</p>
        <p>Mack: Hood close.</p>
        <p>LaCrosse: Stopping trunk.</p>
        <p>Mack: Hood close.</p>
        <p>LaCrosse: Closing hood.</p>
        <p>Just as I was about to shout, ''Open sesame,'' Mr. Mack coaxed the LaCrosse to open my door and allow me to escape.</p>
        <p>Such is life when driving concept cars -- which after all, are designed to be seen and not necessarily to be driven, or even usually to be heard. But it is hard to resist when G.M. offers a chance for even a short drive in $20 million worth of futuristic hardware.</p>
        <p>One does not drive these vehicles to evaluate their dynamics. Rather, it's an exercise in make-believe, like sitting in your father's car in the driveway when you were 7, sawing at the steering wheel and imagining that you were on the road.</p>
        <p>But this is better because there is a little more than make-believe. You can drive them up to about 25 m.p.h. and get a glimpse of what they'd be like as production models.</p>
        <p>For instance, not far from the surly LaCrosse is the Hummer H2, a smaller, more deluxe version of the military vehicle.</p>
        <p>After 15 days and 6,000 miles in a race-prepared Hummer in the 1996 Granada-Dakar off-road race, I much prefer the H2 with its leather bucket seats and leather, suede and aluminum interior touches. Plus, there is a Hummer-sized canvas sunroof the size of Rhode Island.</p>
        <p>Also nearby is the Chevrolet SSR, for Super Sports Roadster, which has the visual impact of the Plymouth Prowler but is much more practical, thanks to a pickup bed with a hard cover. One of six concept vehicles on hand, it is a sure bet for production.</p>
        <p>In an inelegant move, I fall down and over the sill into the cockpit. The driver's seat doesn't slide; we don't have working seat belts; and the speedometer and other electronics are shut off to save battery power. But we have plenty of other power. The 6-liter V-8 can send more than 300 horsepower to the rear wheels.</p>
        <p>I turn the key and fire up the engine. I'm holding a large, three-spoke steering wheel, a design cue from the past. The automatic transmission is shifted with a button on the steering wheel. Three taps and I'm in ''drive''; a second later, we're moving.</p>
        <p>The ride is stiff, even on the ultra-smooth track, and the body shakes.</p>
        <p>''They are all hand-built cars,'' said Andre Hudson, a 23-year-old designer. ''This is actually one of the best ones; the other ones are quite a bit more fragile.''</p>
        <p>The tires don't help the ride. The tread was hand-cut by Goodyear in a pattern that mimics Chevy's bow-tie emblem.</p>
        <p>But the SSR changes direction quickly, and you realize how strong a performer it will be if G.M. keeps the weight down. The truck's potential is impressive. Plus, when we finish the drive, it lets me out.</p>
