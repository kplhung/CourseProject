        <p>MAGIC realism is alive and well and living in New Jersey. Or so one gathers from ''The Illuminated Woman,'' a tight little show of paintings and drawings by Eileen Kennedy-Dyne, of Perrineville, at the Cooper Gallery here.</p>
        <p>Although the term ''magic realism'' is now most familiar through its application to literature, particularly the work of Latin American writers like Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the phrase was coined in the 1920's with reference to painting. Alfred Barr, who organized an exhibition on the theme at the Museum of Modern Art in 1943, applied the label to ''the work of painters who by means of an exact realistic technique try to make plausible and convincing their improbable, dreamlike or fantastic visions.''</p>

        <p>MAGIC realism is alive and well and living in New Jersey. Or so one gathers from ''The Illuminated Woman,'' a tight little show of paintings and drawings by Eileen Kennedy-Dyne, of Perrineville, at the Cooper Gallery here.</p>
        <p>Although the term ''magic realism'' is now most familiar through its application to literature, particularly the work of Latin American writers like Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the phrase was coined in the 1920's with reference to painting. Alfred Barr, who organized an exhibition on the theme at the Museum of Modern Art in 1943, applied the label to ''the work of painters who by means of an exact realistic technique try to make plausible and convincing their improbable, dreamlike or fantastic visions.''</p>
        <p>That's as good a description as any for what Ms. Kennedy-Dyne is up to. The five paintings in her series ''The Illuminated Woman'' seem to form a single narrative of a woman's life, though the exact details of the story remain vague. What is clear is the atmosphere in which the story develops: one of stasis and isolation.</p>
        <p>All five paintings present the same character in the same setting, and from the same point of view. In all of them, the depicted space is divided into an inaccessible background and a stage-like foreground by an openwork metal screen that sits atop a table. (An amusing installation detail: the real screen is displayed in the gallery's front window.) The woman who is the subject of the paintings is always -- except in ''Still Life with Flowers and Fruit,'' 2000, presumably the final stage of the story -- behind the screen, like a caged animal.</p>
        <p>We glimpse her in bits and pieces, but she seems to maintain the same grave, impassive expression in each scene. Yet in every case she reaches out to the space on the viewer's side of the screen. In ''Gentlemen Callers,'' 1999, the suitors' neckties have been left draped across the screen and their roses lie on the tabletop. Both the woman's hands reach through the grill to grab one of the ties, presumably all she could hold onto from a transitory encounter.</p>
        <p>Painted in Ms. Kennedy-Dyne's rather dry, linear style, the image carries a subdued sense of pathos. The sense of frustration implied is brought to the point of being ridiculous, however, in ''All That Glitters,'' 1998, in which the woman, here nude, reaches out to grasp one of a bunch of apples that now rest on the tablecloth. She holds it up to her face as though she meant to bite at it through the screen. It could have been an affectingly absurd gesture, were it not that the impulse behind it seems contradicted by the woman's deadpan expression. Another problem with this painting is that Ms. Kennedy-Dyne's love of precision lets her down here in depicting the nude body behind the screen. Inexplicably, the woman's anatomy seems completely off-kilter.</p>
        <p>''After the Ball,'' also painted in 1998, is essentially another attempt at the same subject, this time handled much more effectively. This time, the woman's wide-eyed mien suggests something of the way her desire has taken hold of her.</p>
        <p>In ''Homage to the Madonna With Fire Screen,''1999, it is an infant sleeping on a tiny mattress toward which Ms. Kennedy-Dyne's heroine reaches. Finally, in the ironically titled ''Still Life With Flowers and Fruit,'' the woman herself lays on the near side of the screen, under a translucent shroud. What has she died of? Unrequited love?</p>
        <p>More to the point, do we really care? The artist seems to want to say something about a contemporary woman's life -- in an artist's statement she speaks of ''an almost desperate need to find meaning in the trappings of everyday existence.'' But her archaizing manner puts her meaning at an unreachable distance: behind a decorative screen, as it were. The added layers of symbolism, like the evocation of Eve's temptation in ''All That Glitters'' and ''After the Ball,'' tend to come across as more pretentious than profound.</p>
        <p>And yet, although she stumbles badly in ''All That Glitters,'' the disciplined sobriety of Ms. Kennedy-Dyne's style, even as she delves into the ornamental details of her compositions, has an inherent poignancy. One suspects that if she were willing to free that style of its literary burdens it could become even stronger.</p>
        <p>That suspicion becomes even stronger in the light of Ms. Kennedy-Dyne's red pencil drawings, depicting the same subjects as her paintings and at the same scale. Where the paintings remain airless, there is a subdued atmospheric quality to drawings that gives the images added eloquence.</p>
        <p>The mournful tenor of Ms. Kennedy-Dyne's paintings is all too appropriate for the occasion of the final exhibition at a gallery that has been part of the Jersey City scene for a decade. The Cooper Gallery's owner, Ahn Behrens, says the gallery will be reopening soon in New York City.</p>
