        <p>WHEN a single mother of three young sons was trying to cope with the illness of her youngest child, she called on Friends of the Family.</p>

        <p>WHEN a single mother of three young sons was trying to cope with the illness of her youngest child, she called on Friends of the Family.</p>
        <p>''They helped me a lot,'' she said of the organization that tries to keep families from falling apart in a crisis. ''They brought us dinner once a week and gave me an allotment of money for a baby sitter and a housekeeper. It relieved a lot of stress for me at a time that was very difficult.''</p>
        <p>Mary Stein and Kathy Staudt, both Larchmont residents who started Friends of the Family here three years ago, have 200 volunteers ready to help out whenever a parent or child becomes ill and the family needs a life line. The group, mostly women in the Larchmont and Mamaroneck area, offer to bake, baby-sit, car pool and more.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stein and Ms. Staudt got the idea for the organization three years ago after they saw how neighbors banded together to help a Larchmont mother with a terminal illness.</p>
        <p>''It was an inspiration to see how a group of people, many of them just vaguely connected to this woman, got together during this terrible situation,'' Ms. Staudt said.</p>
        <p>Both Ms. Staudt and Ms. Stein said they were so moved by the support that they decided something concrete should come of it.</p>
        <p>''When a tragedy like this occurs, people don't know what to do or say,'' Ms. Stein said. ''You might know of a situation down the street, but if you're not friendly with the family, you're not comfortable ringing the doorbell and asking what you can do to help.''</p>
        <p>Friends of the Family, whose motto is ''Neighbors Helping Neighbors,'' coordinates services like driving children to school, taking a patient to treatments, walking the dog, hiring a housekeeper, finding a financial planner or cooking a meal. The organization, which is financed through fund-raisers and individual donations, has paid for tutoring, arranged after-school care and summer programs and helped arrange payment schedules for medical bills. There is no charge to families.</p>
        <p>''What makes this group different from other groups is that we truly focus on the entire family, not just the individual who is sick,'' Ms. Staudt said. Once the group is contacted, two people meet with a family to assess its needs. ''Our goal is to keep the fabric of the family together. We take a very realistic look at the demands on people's time and try to make a model that works.''</p>
        <p>The only stipulation is that after a maximum of three months, a family must look for other sources of help, though the organization will often  contact counselors or social workers and try to get discounts for tutoring and other services.</p>
        <p>''We're merely providing some stabilization to a family until they are able to adjust to their situation,''  Ms. Stein said. ''Unfortunately, we can't help out forever. We just don't have the funds.''</p>
        <p>As part of its fund-raising effort, Friends of the Family is putting together a cookbook to sell in the area.</p>
        <p>Confidentiality is a big part of the group's allure. ''We respect people's privacy,'' Ms. Stein said. ''We will only help if we're called.'' In fact, the organization is so low-key that unless you know a member of the community who has used it, or talked about it, you might not know it exists.</p>
        <p>Not a day has gone by that the group has not helped someone, Ms. Stein said, adding that the organization often helps two or three families at a time.</p>
        <p>''Families are transient,'' Ms. Stein said. ''Many of us no longer live near our relatives. With Friends, your neighbor can be a person clear across town or the person you see occasionally at the Grand Union.''  The number to call for more information or to volunteer is 833-2513.</p>
