        <p>The Travel section receives hundreds of letters from readers about their experiences with airline travel. Although most write to complain, a small number actually offer words of praise. Here is a selection from the last year:</p>
        <p>To the Editor: On a recent US Airways flight from La Guardia to Charleston, S.C., my wife, I and six others were arbitrarily denied boarding while standing in line with boarding passes and seat assignments. Because of weight restrictions due to the weather, those of us at the rear of the line could not board. It subsequently left with 11 empty seats and 8 of us at the gate.</p>
