        <p>As animal-rights advocates protested recently in Manhattan against the killing of rats on the CBS show  ''Survivor,'' Bushwick residents were filming their own rat movie.</p>
        <p>Sitting on her stoop, Maria Molina trained a video camera on the sidewalk. It did not take long for the show's stars to appear. Emerging from under a car, one figure scuttled across the sidewalk. Another followed. A third climbed into a trash can and proceeded to chew a hole in a neatly tied plastic bag.</p>
        <p>The video is part of an attempt by Grove Street Tenants Together, a tenant association of which Ms. Molina is president, to persuade the city to curb the rats, which they say have been stealing food, damaging homes and cars and fraying nerves.</p>
        <p>Rats have always lurked in Bushwick, but residents say they have multiplied alarmingly in the last year. Often, screams in the night are heard from startled pedestrians.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem is the number  of empty lots in the area, the legacy of arsons during the 70's. Residents say outsiders dump garbage on the lots, which become rat breeding grounds.</p>
        <p>Inocencia Nolasco said her grandchildren could not sleep on the bottom bunk bed because of the rats.</p>
        <p>''They send the exterminators and they put the giant glue traps,'' she said of the city's efforts. ''But that does nothing unless you clean the basements and clean the lots.''</p>
        <p>Sitting outside has become a dance routine, she added. ''It's a matter of lifting your feet and avoiding them when they go by.''</p>
        <p>Isabel Gonzalez, another resident, added, ''People are at the point where they joke about it. They're like, 'Yeah, they're in the basement constructing their own housing.' ''</p>
        <p>Tenant association members said that, at a recent meeting with officials from the Health Department, they felt they were being blamed for creating the unsanitary conditions that attract the rats.</p>
        <p>But Erich Giebelhaus, a spokesman for the New York City Department of Health, said: ''The intent of our educational material is not to blame. It's to educate as to the conditions that can harbor rats.''</p>
        <p>He said that inspectors, who were directed to go to the area late last week, would issue fines of $200 to $2,000 to property owners who violated codes, and added that the department would try to work with owners of the vacant lots to clean them.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, people are trying their own remedies. Rats don't seem to like music, they say, so boom boxes are common along the street at night. Teenagers sit out with baseball bats, to flatten rats that venture too close.</p>
        <p>But a classic defense seems to have fizzled. ''We got a couple of cats,'' Ms. Molina said. ''But they couldn't do anything. They left.''</p>
