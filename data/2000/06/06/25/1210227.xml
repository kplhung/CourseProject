        <p>WHEN Isaac Mizrahi abandoned fashion two years ago, thus reducing by 100 percent the number of designers who whimsically affixed fur doughnuts to women's suits, he announced that he would focus his energy on a career in show business.</p>
        <p>In the 1995 documentary about him, ''Unzipped,'' Mr. Mizrahi proved himself to be the kind of person to whom campily arch observations of popular culture come effortlessly. One imagined him getting the Tony Randall role in hipper versions of Doris Day movies, or producing a series like ''The Sopranos'' in which people kill one another over shoes, or perhaps being a talk-show host where he did most of the talking himself.</p>
        <p>Who would have divined, though, that it was really Betty Buckley the designer wanted to be?</p>
        <p>Over four nights last week, Mr. Mizrahi quietly performed a dry run of a one-man cabaret act at the Greenwich House, a 99-seat theater on Barrow Street. The former designer, who was forced out of business when his financial backer, Chanel, grew weary of losses, has been working on his show, called ''Les MIZrahi,'' for two years. It is being produced by the Drama Department, a nonprofit theater company, and the audience consisted largely of its non-Manolo Blahnik-shod subscribers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mizrahi is significantly leaner than he was during the Tater Tots days chronicled in ''Unzipped.'' His hair gelled into peaks, he approached the stage in a form-fitting black T-shirt and black sunglasses looking like Bono in a remake of ''High Society,'' and burst into song. Accompanied by the Ben Waltzer trio, Mr. Mizrahi belted out a parody of Stephen Sondheim's ''Me and My Town,'' which he rejiggered with the composer's help, importuning the audience to ''Love me! Love my show!''</p>
        <p>What followed, in addition to lots more singing, including a rendition of ''Baubles, Bangles and Beads,'' were reminiscences about Mr. Mizrahi's life in fashion, not entirely free of bitterness.</p>
        <p>We learn of the moment he encountered his first Norman Norell (on his mother in the communal dressing room at Loehmann's), how he pulled off his first runway show with no cash (all the supermodels volunteered) and what happened when Helen Hunt asked him to dress her for the 1998 Oscars, the year she won the best actress award for her role as a waitress in ''As Good as It Gets,'' a film Mr. Mizrahi refers to as ''As Bad as It Gets.''</p>
        <p>On stage, Mr. Mizrahi sketched the dress he designed for her, recounting that he also made her three others, only to discover while watching the Academy Awards that she had opted for a Gucci. His anger subsided when his mother called to say, ''Lana Turner as a waitress, O.K. Joan Crawford as a waitress, fine. But Helen Hunt -- it's a little too realistic.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mizrahi also sews a coat on stage and changes into a rhinestone-studded suit he designed.</p>
        <p>The singing designer's road to the stage has not been entirely smooth. An earlier, ill-fated incarnation of his one-man show was attempted by Susan Gallen, a producer, and the director Joe Mantello, whose resume includes Terrence McNally's ''Love! Valor! Compassion!''</p>
        <p>The idea was to take the show to an Off Broadway house like the Jane Street Theater, where ''Hedwig and the Angry Inch'' played, said Bill Craver, Mr. Mantello's agent. During one reading of the show for potential investors, Mr. Craver said, Mr. Mizrahi was very nervous and wanted to read with a script. His partners told him to remember that if the project got off the ground, he'd have to perform eight times a week.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the show did not get off the ground, Mr. Craver said, because of scheduling issues and because Ms. Gallen and Mr. Mantello felt that the former designer, not quite in possession of a voice like Mel Torme's, should pare down on the musical numbers.</p>
        <p>Wendell Harrington, a film and video projection designer who attended one of the readings of the work in progress, said that it ''wasn't good.''</p>
        <p>''No one had helped him,'' Ms. Harrington added. ''He needed a nurturing environment.''</p>
        <p>The Drama Department, of which Ms. Harrington is a member, proved to be that environment.</p>
        <p>After last week's performances before a live audience, which laughed appreciatively at Mr. Mizrahi's storytelling, Michael Rosenberg, managing director of the Drama Department, said he would sit down with his resident star to talk about the next step. (Mr. Mizrahi is simultaneously developing a magazine-format television show for the USA Network that focuses on style.)</p>
        <p>''A lot has been polished and made funnier,'' Mr. Rosenberg said. A formal production of the show, perhaps held at the company's Barrow Street theater, perhaps in a cocktail lounge, may take place at the end of the summer or early fall, Mr. Rosenberg said. He appeared to have no misgivings about Mr. Mizrahi's voice. ''I think it's great,'' he said.</p>
