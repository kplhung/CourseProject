        <p>THE sun setting behind the Palisades, glimmering red-gold on the Hudson River; the long twilight enlivened by the sounds of jazz floating through the warm evening air: what could be more in keeping with summer?</p>
        <p>This season, for the first time, lovers of music al fresco will be able to attend free concerts on Wednesday evenings in Waterfront Park here. The first Dobbs Ferry summer music series, produced by Mark Morganelli for Jazz Forum Arts, began this month and will run through Aug. 16. Concerts are from 6:30 to 8 p.m. at the park on the bank of the river at the foot of High Street. (The number to call for directions is (914) 631-1000.) For those who like to dine while listening, restaurants will be selling light refreshments.</p>
        <p>The series was the idea of Celeste Meneses, president of the Dobbs Ferry Chamber of Commerce; Peggy Slavin, village administrator; and Mr. Morganelli. Mr. Morganelli, who plays trumpet and flugelhorn, lived in Manhattan for many years, where he produced jazz festivals at various places. When he moved to Dobbs Ferry in 1991, he began exploring the river towns and said he fell in love with the Tarrytown Music Hall, where he began the Swing Summit jazz series. He also got bookings for his own combo, Mark Morganelli and the Jazz Forum All Stars, and for other solo artists and bands at various outdoor spots, some run by the county and some by municipalities.</p>
        <p>Waterfront Park in Dobbs Ferry, he reasoned, would be a perfect site, with its dramatic river views. Ms. Meneses added that the concerts will ''make our village a destination'' and will give nonresidents a chance to visit the park, which during regular hours is open only to those who live in the village. ''The park will be open to everyone for the concerts,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The artists he has booked for the series play various jazz styles, and there is an evening of bluegrass and one of classical pieces. The schedule: June 28, Sherry Winston, flutist; July 5, Philharmonia Virtuosi, string quartet; July 12, David (Fathead) Newman Quintet, with Mr. Newman on tenor sax; July 19, the Wickers Creek Band, bluegrass artists, and Blake Rowe, a guitarist who plays children's songs; July 26, Mark Morganelli and the Jazz Forum All Stars; Aug. 2, the Bronx Horns, performing a tribute to Tito Puente; Aug. 9, Lou Donaldson who plays alto sax and sings the blues; and on Aug. 16, Houston Person on tenor sax and Etta Jones, vocalist.</p>
