        <p>When Laura Moore was growing up, she dreamed of being an Olympic figure skater. While living in East Africa, she read a book about a poor, sickly child befriended by a star skater. The sickly girl became the star.</p>
        <p>The reality was different. Shy and klutzy, incapable of catching a ball, Moore failed gym 12 times. During kickball games she switched teams every half-inning so she would not have to play, and nobody complained because they didn't want her playing, either. She graduated from high school with a special dispensation because she did not have a single gym credit.</p>
        <p>So it came as a surprise when she later found herself through sports, specifically in competitions among gay athletes.</p>
        <p>Moore realized she was gay at an early age, but by the time she was 30 she found herself married and living in the suburbs, desperately ill with a stress-related disease and hating everything about her life. So, 12 years ago, she left her husband, moved to New York City and signed up for an ice skating class.</p>
        <p>In the 1994 Gay Games in New York, she initiated a figure skating meet -- overcoming skepticism from organizers that the event would not flourish during the summer games -- and became part of the first lesbian pairs team to compete. She and her partner won the gold medal.</p>
        <p>''It was pretty exciting, to say the least,'' said Moore, who is now 44. ''I finally felt like, O.K., this is the life that I was supposed to have. I know I'm never going to do a triple jump. I'm never going to be in the Olympics. But I have done more with skating and skating has done more for me than I could ever have imagined. I totally feel for the first time in my life that I am part of a community. I belong to a global gay sports community.''</p>
        <p>Moore is now the vice president of Team New York, an organization that was reinvented in late 1997 to foster sports and cultural events for gays and lesbians. Yesterday, Team New York sponsored three events as part of the second annual Team New York Sports and Cultural Festival during Gay Pride Week: a two-mile community challenge run in Central Park, the NYSwimillennium2000, a 14-event meet at Lehman College in the Bronx, and the Metro Gay Wrestling Alliance Tournament and Open Mat Clinic at the McBurney Y.M.C.A. Annex in Manhattan. The run was expected to draw about 1,000 people, the swim meet up to 200 entrants from four countries.</p>
        <p>Team New York has existed since the first Gay Games in San Francisco in 1982 and has sent athletes to all four quadrennial games since. But the group disbanded after each Games and hurriedly reorganized just before the next one. In 1997, an officer for the 1998 Gay Games in Amsterdam phoned Ruth Gursky -- an active volunteer since the 1990 Vancouver Games -- and asked her to set up a meeting to generate interest in New York. Gursky called everyone she knew, took out two ads in community newspapers, reserved a room and hoped for the best.</p>
        <p>One hundred and fifty people showed up.</p>
        <p>''It showed all of us that there was a need to have an organization, it was just a question of who was going to do it,'' said Gursky. ''I realized it was going to be me or nobody.''</p>
        <p>She recruited a treasurer and a co-president and started having meetings. Team New York is now associated with groups that participate in 20 sports, including square dancing and table tennis, as well as more traditional sports like softball, volleyball and swimming.</p>
        <p>''Many gay and lesbian people feel funny, feel awkward, feel they're not being accepted on a regular team,'' said Gursky, who also swims on a masters team. ''I think we can really make a difference in people's lives.''</p>
        <p>Participation in gay and lesbian sports has increased steadily, both in New York and worldwide. The 1982 San Francisco Gay Games had 1,350 athletes and a budget of $125,000, while the '94 New York Games had 11,000 athletes and a $6.5 million budget. Both numbers are expected to be much higher for the 2002 Games in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>Blane Roberts, a former vice president of Front Runners, a gay and lesbian running group, said the New York chapter had 431 members in 1996. Now there are 460. Directly after the Amsterdam Games in '98, an average of five wrestlers showed up weekly at the Metro Gay Wrestling Alliance; now the number has nearly tripled. Last year, the open house for the International Gay Figure Skating Union, co-founded by Moore, drew six people. This year there were 50.</p>
        <p>''I've observed that a lot of gay and lesbian men or women were either intimidated by athletics, didn't feel that they could compete, were uncomfortable with the situation,'' said Mike Colgrove, the vice president and coach of the Metro Gay Wrestling Alliance. ''We get a lot of people who are interested but are afraid to try it, not because of their ability but because of how they might be perceived. I think this gives a lot of gay men and lesbian women an opportunity to try things they might have been afraid of before.''</p>
        <p>For others, the increasing visibility of the Gay Games made competing in sports a welcome alternative to a social scene that consisted mainly of bars and clubs. ''I knew very few gay people and I was going to the bars,'' said Barbara Gurtov, 55, who bowls in a gay and lesbian league at Chelsea Piers. ''And I got sick of the bars because I'm not a bar person and in those days they didn't have many functions and now they do.''</p>
        <p>Although friendship and support are the key components to many of the gay and lesbian clubs, competition is also important, many of the club leaders said.</p>
        <p>''It was a total comfort level,'' Stephen DeRose, treasurer of Team New York and a two-time Gay Games gold medalist for body building, said of gay competitions. ''You could be who you wanted to be. Jump up and down and scream. Clap and not have to worry, 'He's going to think I'm gay.' ''</p>
        <p>Moore is still astonished by her metamorphosis from unhappy, uncoordinated homemaker to medal-winning figure skater immersed in a loving and accepting community.</p>
        <p>''If you had told me when I was a child that I would become a competitive athlete and I was going to have a drawer full of medals and I was going to do something that people the world over are going to be interested in because no one's ever done it before, I would have laughed in their faces,'' she said. ''There are now so many opportunities to meet people and participate in activities that are healthy and fun. I really believe that the gay sports movement has changed a lot of people's lives.''</p>
