        <p>BLUMBERG-Thelma. On June 15, 2000. Devotion to family; warm camaraderie with friends; an intellectual excursion starting at Lincoln HS and Brooklyn College and continuing through many elder hostels and the Brandeis University National Women's Committee; a satisfying career as a math teacher at Andrew Jackson HS and John Bowne HS; an active appreciation of the arts, nature, good food, playing bridge, swimming, and travel; and we particularly remember Thelma for her vigorous dedication to progressive politics and humanist values. We hope family and friends revitalize their efforts for justice and peace in her memory.</p>
