        <p>ADAM SCHLESINGER is a busy man. Besides producing a record in California and writing songs for movies, the former Montclair resident is a member of two critically acclaimed rock bands, the wispy Ivy and the bouncy Fountains of Wayne, with whom he will appear this week at Maxwell's in Hoboken.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schlesinger, 32, grew up listening to records by the Beatles, the Zombies and the Kinks, bands known for their succinct commercial pop songs. When he met Chris Collingwood, of Philadelphia, at Williams College in western Massachusetts in the mid-1980's, they found they were musical soulmates. A few years later they relocated to Manhattan and formed Fountains of Wayne, a band known for its snappy, smart three-minute pop ditties, backed by plucky guitarwork and a strong rhythm section.</p>

        <p>ADAM SCHLESINGER is a busy man. Besides producing a record in California and writing songs for movies, the former Montclair resident is a member of two critically acclaimed rock bands, the wispy Ivy and the bouncy Fountains of Wayne, with whom he will appear this week at Maxwell's in Hoboken.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schlesinger, 32, grew up listening to records by the Beatles, the Zombies and the Kinks, bands known for their succinct commercial pop songs. When he met Chris Collingwood, of Philadelphia, at Williams College in western Massachusetts in the mid-1980's, they found they were musical soulmates. A few years later they relocated to Manhattan and formed Fountains of Wayne, a band known for its snappy, smart three-minute pop ditties, backed by plucky guitarwork and a strong rhythm section.</p>
        <p>In 1996, they released their eponymous debut, a mix of clear-visioned, witty songs ranging in theme from disdain of ''Euro-trash'' to boys who curse at girls. Writing a seamless three-minute pop song is a rarely achieved artform, and Fountains of Wayne runs away with the prize.</p>
        <p>Delving into their suburban memories, they have achieved, in a time of heavy guitar riffs and mumbled lyrical sentiments, the impossible. Recreating what made groups like the Beatles and the Kinks so successful.</p>
        <p>''Utopia Parkway,'' released last year, is a masterpiece homage to suburbia. ''We've been saving for a custom van,'' they sing in the title track, ''and I've been playing in a cover band, and my baby doesn't understand, why I never turned from boy to man.''</p>
        <p>The 1960's-like singalong ''Denise'' is about a girl who drives a lavender Lexus, works at Liberty Travel and listens to Puff Daddy. On ''Laser Show,'' suburbanites come to Manhattan's Hayden Planetarium to ''watch the stars James and Jason, Kirk and Lars,'' better known as Metallica. They cover the perennial themes of the Jersey Shore, the prom, summertime, and driving through the ''valley of the malls'' with a lyrical and melodic maturity, sounding both familiar and fresh.</p>
        <p>When they sing ''I'm just a hat and feet,'' it is easy to see the man crushed by heartbreak, right where he stood, cartoon-style.</p>
        <p>Between the release of their debut and ''Utopia Parkway,'' Mr. Schlesinger was nominated for a 1996 Oscar for writing the title song for Tom Hanks's film about rock 'n' roll, ''That Thing You Do.'' He also recorded with Ivy, a popular band on the alternative music scene.</p>
        <p>''We like to write songs that are whole, songs that people can relate to and have fun listening to,'' Mr. Schlesinger said.</p>
        <p>After the release of ''Utopia Parkway,'' Fountains of Wayne was dropped from their label, Atlantic Records.</p>
        <p>The label wanted to release the band's slow-mo, compelling cover of Britney Spears's ''Baby One More Time,'' as a single.</p>
        <p>''Here we had spent so much time working on our own songs, and they wanted to release one that we hadn't written, it was kind of hurtful and insulting,'' Mr. Schlesinger said. A hit with a song like that could have relegated them to one-hit-wonder novelty-band status, and they knew they were too good for that.</p>
        <p>''Baby One More Time'' is now a popular download on sites like Napster, which was just sued by Metallica, which has the same management as Fountains of Wayne.</p>
        <p>Right now, on hiatus, Mr. Schlesinger and Mr. Collingwood are in low gear, mostly writing, hoping to soon have enough material for a new album, for a new label they are scouting out. Mr. Collingwood plays with a country band in western Massachusetts, and Mr. Schlesinger is producing a band featuring Jason Schwartzman, star of ''Rushmore.'' He has written a song, ''Too Cool for School,'' for Keenan Ivory Wayans's coming film, ''Scary Movie.'' He also completed a new album with Ivy and has written a song for the coming ''Josie and the Pussycats'' film.</p>
        <p>''I'm partly in recovery,'' Mr. Schlesinger said with a laugh, adding that taking ''little windows'' of time for rest and relaxation is part of the natural cycle of touring. ''Everyone enjoys touring for the first few weeks,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Collingwood, on the other hand, said ''touring has become torturous.''</p>
        <p>''I like performing for people,'' he said, ''but I hate the traveling.''</p>
        <p>Both men are married and say life for a 30-something rocker is different from life for an 18-year-old.</p>
        <p>With songs that range from the ebullient to the plaintive, Fountains of Wayne, named after a garden-statue store, has hit a chord among music lovers who yearn for melody, brevity and mirth.</p>
        <p>Fountains of Wayne, Mr. Schlesinger said, has a simple credo: ''We try to make music that we're not embarrassed about.''</p>
        <p>FOUNTAINS OF WAYNE  Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken.  Tonight at 8:30.  (201) 653-1703.</p>
