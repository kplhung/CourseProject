        <p>As part of the Tall Ships 2000 Race Series, an international fleet of more than 100 tall ships will visit Boston Harbor July 11 to 20 for Sail Boston 2000.</p>
        <p>The International Sail Training Association is sponsoring the races, which started in April in England and Italy. After races from Southampton and Genoa finished in Cadiz, the ships competed in a trans-Atlantic race to Bermuda. From Bermuda, the fleet will cruise north to Boston.</p>
        <p>The tall ships are expected to start arriving in Boston on July 8. At 9 a.m. on July 11, the fleet will enter the harbor in a Grand Parade of Sail, escorted by the U.S.S. Constitution, Old Ironsides, the oldest commissioned warship in the world, whose berth is at the Charlestown Navy Yard.</p>
        <p>The ships will be docked at the Black Falcon Cruise Terminal, the World Trade Center, the North Jetty and the Navy Yard, and the public will be allowed to board  various ships, including the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy, free. Scheduled events range from a Blessing of the Sails at Old North Church to a jazz and blues festival to two displays of fireworks.</p>
        <p>On July 16, the ships will parade out of the harbor for the next leg of the race, to Halifax, Nova Scotia. After Halifax, the ships will race back across the Atlantic to Amsterdam. But some tall ships will remain on view until July 21.</p>
        <p>A schedule of events is available at www.sailboston.com. More information, including ticket prices for certain events, is also available at (617) 439-4114.</p>
