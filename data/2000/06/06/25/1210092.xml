        <p>FROM the young and the starry-eyed to the oldest established pros, the  summerfolk come to Powerhouse in Poughkeepsie for renewal.</p>
        <p>In a Disneyfied, digitalilized world, where Broadway depends on high-decibel amplification and showy special effects, the theater program at Vassar College means to be a life preserver for an imperiled art form that makes human sounds in two intimate theaters, each seating 140. It's not for nothing that the name of the program, which began Friday and lasts through Aug. 5, is Powerhouse. For it is all about the power of art and providing the house that art lives in -- for six weeks anyway.</p>

        <p>FROM the young and the starry-eyed to the oldest established pros, the  summerfolk come to Powerhouse in Poughkeepsie for renewal.</p>
        <p>In a Disneyfied, digitalilized world, where Broadway depends on high-decibel amplification and showy special effects, the theater program at Vassar College means to be a life preserver for an imperiled art form that makes human sounds in two intimate theaters, each seating 140. It's not for nothing that the name of the program, which began Friday and lasts through Aug. 5, is Powerhouse. For it is all about the power of art and providing the house that art lives in -- for six weeks anyway.</p>
        <p>For those six weeks, playwrights, actors, directors, techies are immersed in the process, and the public can see plays, ready or not, in virtually any phase of developement.  This summer, the plays -- main stage productions, special presentations, musicals in progress, staged readings of new works by  playwrights, all in their 20's, and free outdoor theater by the apprentice company -- add up to 17.</p>
        <p>Just as the creative process is an elusive,  undefinable thing, what the program offers apprentices and writers changes from year to year, reshaping itself to artistic needs.</p>
        <p>''We keep the program flexible,'' said the managing producer, Johanna Pfaelzer, managing director of New York Stage and Film Company, the production arm of Powerhouse. ''We figure out what the writer and director need to take the play to the next level. We respond organically and keep the rules fluid.''</p>
        <p>Now in the program's 16th season, though, the mission of perpetuating theater remains unwavering.</p>
        <p>If stage is the thing, what about the film part? In its beginnings, New York Stage and Film made short features on Vassar's 1,000 acres or in town, ''but that started to overpower everything else,'' Ms. Pfaelzer said, allowing that ''film people get up at 4, theater people go to bed at 4.''</p>
        <p>Still, the crossover of playwrights to screenwriters is increasingly common, if not essential, given the schism between paychecks.</p>
        <p>John Patrick Shanley has developed one stage work after another at Powerhouse but remains best known as an Oscar winner for  writing the film ''Moonstruck.''</p>
        <p>''Our goal is to get back to doing both,'' Ms. Pfaelzer said, adding that a developmental lab for screenwriters is expected to be reintroduced next summer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shanley, whose epic ''Cellini'' is to open at Second Stage Off Broadway next season, will be back this summer at Powerhouse, which produced ''Cellini'' two years ago. Other artists in residence include Lee Blessing and Theresa Rebeck, both playwrights who have emphatically arrived. After his ''Chesapeake,'' which was developed at Vassar last summer, moved to Off Broadway, Mr. Blessing called Ms. Pfaelzer and asked, ''Can you find me a room so I can work this summer?'' And Ms. Rebeck asked to come up for a week and work, adding, ''I need as much help as I can get.''</p>
        <p>What then does an artist in residence mean? It means whatever it means. No play, in any form, by Mr. Shanley, Mr. Blessing or Ms. Rebeck is on this summer's schedule. None of them is expected to produce a word, but if they come up with something -- a scene, say -- and want to hear it before staff, colleagues or whoever passes by, no actor in residence will say no.</p>
        <p>''We find them a place to write in, and when they're ready, a cast and a reading will follow,'' Ms. Pfaflzer said. ''They need to kick ideas around, to know they can hear their work out loud when they need to. Sometimes a writer will say, 'I know there's a play in here somewhere,' and that's enough for us.''</p>
        <p>Jocelyn Meinhardt was an artist in residence of another sort. In 1995, as a young playwright of promise, she recalled being invited for a month and a half in the country ''to do what I wanted to do.''</p>
        <p>What she wanted to do was work on a play in a very early stage. ''This gave me the opportunity to go away and focus on my writing,'' she said. ''It was the best-case scenario -- getting out of the city, being part of a theater community, hanging out with professional actors, exciting, funny, interesting people, and going out at night to see a play -- the whole spectrum, from Shakespeare to new plays. Every time you blinked, a new show was going on.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Meinhart, who had a workshop production of her ''Ruler of My Destiny'' at Long Wharf Theater's Stage  Two in New Haven, returns to Vassar every summer ''just to see plays.''</p>
        <p>Clearly, they keep coming back, but in different ways. Josh Radner's way is one of the most affirming. An apprentice in 1994, Mr. Radner, now 25, is a professional actor this summer, playing one of nine characters in the season's first full production, ''The Lively Lad'' by Quincy Long, a wacky piece with dark undertones, in the actor's words, to be directed by one of the program's founders, Max Mayer. Mr. Radner, who was a Kenyon College junior when he was first accepted by Powerhouse, never for a moment wondered why he left Ohio.  ''With other programs I know of, you might wind up lugging furniture or hanging lights, but they guaranteed I'd get to do some acting,'' Mr. Radner recalled.</p>
        <p>Indeed. Mr. Radner was cast in the apprentice outdoor staging of ''Macbeth,'' in the title role, no less. He went on to get a master's degree in fine arts in acting at New York University. His agent called. Now in a sentimental homecoming, Mr. Radner is returning to the first site of his real theater experience outside of Ohio. ''I was exhilarated then,'' he said. ''And now that I'm on the other side, I still am.''</p>
        <p>A focused space and a safe place are the most recurring phrases of past participants; a retreat the inevitable word. And the first timers are often illustrious, in their own fashion. A new play, ''The Dazzle,'' which is Richard Greenberg's take on the eccentric Collier brothers who became fabled symbols of cluttermania, is to be produced by Off Broadway's Drama Dept. The prolific Mr. Greeenberg, who wrote the play for the actors Peter Frechette and Reg Rogers, who will be in it here, said,  ''Powerhouse chose me,'' and added that it will help him find out more about his own play, ''in a constant process of discovery.''</p>
        <p>Jules Feiffer, now a writer at 71, was also chosen. Having given up his syndicated cartoons to concentrate on children's books, he said that he would never have stopped writing plays, as he did after dismissive reviews of ''Elliot Loves'' in 1990, if he had lived outside of New York.</p>
        <p>''It took me five years to get 'Grown-Ups' on,'' he said of one of his best-though-failed plays. ''And I'm famous.''</p>
        <p>He continued: ''But you can't let what happens in New York destroy something that gives you pleasure, and now I will not deny that pleasure.''</p>
        <p>In the spirit of true collaboration, Mr. Feiffer's new theater piece, ''Jules' Blues,'' a musical series of more than 20 vignettes, lasting from an estimated 30 seconds to 30 minutes, is a family affair, featuring his wife, Jennifer Allen, and his daughter, Halley Feiffer, not to mention a few of their best friends.</p>
        <p>Mark Linn-Baker, a much admired actor, founded the organization with Mr. Mayer and Leslie Urdang, a film producer. And Mr. Linn-Baker keeps coming back every summer to ''keep the flame burning,'' he said. ''There is no more reward than the work itself.'' The actors' work this summer is playing in ''Frog and Toad,'' a musicalization of the children's book series by Arnold Lobel, who was Mr. Linn-Baker's father-in-law. Adrianne Lobel, his wife, is the set designer. Mr. Linn-Baker is the toad.</p>
        <p>''Not all our developmental work is for everybody,'' Mr. Linn-Baker added.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the few places fulfilling the freedom of artistic pursuit without the crunching pressure of commercial success.''</p>
        <p>That has caused some people to speak of Powerhouse as exclusionary, a sort of elitist summer camp for creative grown-ups.</p>
        <p>''Maybe we have to be,'' the program's executive director, Beth</p>
        <p>Fargis-Lancaster, said. ''Here we think everyone is interested in the professional theater. Isn't that the way it should be? We have to pass on our love of theater to the next generation.''</p>
