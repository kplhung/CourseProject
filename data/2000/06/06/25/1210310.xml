        <p>This has been a month of public tumult for Germany's conservatives over issues of history and over Germans' relations with other ethnic groups.  Conservatives have shown they can still say some very stupid things about the Holocaust. But at the same time, a new policy recommended by the leadership of the Christian Democratic Union, the mainstream conservative party, provides a welcome contrast to these missteps by promising to modernize the right's policies on immigration.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, the Deutschland Foundation, close to the conservative wing of the Christian Democrats, gave an award to the historian Ernst Nolte. He is controversial for his arguments that the Holocaust was not unique and Germany's past not so abnormal. He also says that what Hitler did could be understood as a reaction to Stalin.</p>

        <p>This has been a month of public tumult for Germany's conservatives over issues of history and over Germans' relations with other ethnic groups.  Conservatives have shown they can still say some very stupid things about the Holocaust. But at the same time, a new policy recommended by the leadership of the Christian Democratic Union, the mainstream conservative party, provides a welcome contrast to these missteps by promising to modernize the right's policies on immigration.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, the Deutschland Foundation, close to the conservative wing of the Christian Democrats, gave an award to the historian Ernst Nolte. He is controversial for his arguments that the Holocaust was not unique and Germany's past not so abnormal. He also says that what Hitler did could be understood as a reaction to Stalin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nolte is a well-known historian who argues  for breaking the taboos that have constrained Germany's debate about the Nazi era. But some of his ideas are repugnant, and he deserves no awards. Horst Moller, head of one of Germany's most prestigious research institutions, also showed poor judgment in giving the speech honoring Mr. Nolte. The award and the speech were pilloried in the German press.</p>
        <p>A statement by former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a past recipient of a Deutschland Foundation prize, met with even more derision. Mr. Kohl is raising money to pay a $3 million fine levied on the C.D.U. for his acceptance of $1 million in secret political gifts when he was chancellor. When a Social Democratic politician suggested boycotting his fund-raising efforts, Mr. Kohl said it reminded him of boycotts of Jewish shops in the 1930's. Mr. Kohl seems to be completing his transformation from respected statesman to national embarrassment.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kohl represents the past for the Christian Democrats. The party's leadership resigned after the scandals, and its new leader is Angela Merkel, a woman from East Germany. Last week, the leadership released a welcome new policy on immigration that is likely to be adopted in the next few days. Although Germany hosts more foreigners than any other nation in Europe, the C.D.U. had always held that Germany is not a country of immigration. Also, Mr. Kohl was criticized as slow to react to racial violence when he was in office.</p>
        <p>Its new proposal, however, favors bringing the Christian Democrats more in line with the governing Social Democratic Party in regulating immigration. The C.D.U.'s embrace is warmer for software experts than asylum-seekers, but it is nevertheless a long overdue change. Ms. Merkel's challenge now is to convince her more conservative rank and file, who are more wedded to the idea of German ethnic identity and more hostile to immigrants. This is perhaps Germany's most important task for assuring its future as a peaceful and tolerant nation. Germans' treatment of the Nazi era will always be significant. It is also vital for Germany to examine how it treats minorities today.</p>
