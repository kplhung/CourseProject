        <p>Some deals are sealed with a handshake, others with a toast.</p>
        <p>But John Justin, the 83-year-old patriarch of Justin Industries, is closing the sale of his company to Warren E. Buffett with a pair of ostrich-skin cowboy boots.</p>
        <p>''I imagine something sort of like what I got on,'' said Mr. Justin from his headquarters in Fort Worth. ''A kind of souped-up roper boot.'' Besides Justin boots, the company makes Tony Lamas and Noconas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway announced its plan to buy Mr. Justin's brick-and-boot company on Tuesday for $600 million, has plenty of footwear to choose from, since his company already owns the shoemakers H. H. Brown and Dexter.</p>
        <p>But Berkshire probably bought Justin for its bricks, not its boots. Bricks, riding the Southwest's housing boom, account for two-thirds of Justin's revenue and nearly all its profits. Mr. Buffett is even said to have a fondness for the material, solid and dependable like his preferred brands.</p>
        <p>''He indicated that his house is built of bricks and he has owned it for many years,'' said John Roach, the chairman of Justin Industries.</p>
        <p>But sending Mr. Buffett a block of baked clay hardly seemed a fitting end to family ownership that had been unbroken since 1879. Not a common gift item either, Mr. Justin said, adding, ''Be a tough deal to wrap.''</p>
