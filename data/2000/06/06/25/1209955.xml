        <p>People either love their feet or hate them. Perhaps as infants on our backs, we mistook our kicking feet for hovering alien craft and we have never quite gotten used to the idea that they are part of the body. Whenever we catch sight of them we are delighted or revolted anew. Or perhaps since ''sole'' is a homonym of ''soul,'' we confuse feet with our essential being, which we either cherish or despise.</p>
        <p>Gini Alhadeff, in her memoir, ''The Sun at Midday: Tales of a Mediterranean Family,'' says that her parents were so well bred that whole topics of conversation were closed to them. Feet, however, were exempt. ''Pretending to be talking about their feet, they could say just how much better they thought they were: no one has feet like these; and, it's not easy to have pretty feet; and, have you ever seen such fine, regular toes; and, were there ever toes that were less marked by the constriction of shoes? etc.'' In ''The Brothers Karamazov,'' when Dmitry Karamazov is arrested, he is humiliated, not by being charged with murder but by being forced to remove his shoes. ''What made it even more awful was that all his life he had somehow hated the sight of his feet, particularly his big toes, which he found absolutely hideous, and on the big toe of his right foot there was that horrible, rough flat nail that insisted on curling downward. . . . And now all these people were going to see it all!'' This is the season when for good or ill we reveal what has been hidden in our shoes. If you are a Karamazov-type, you may be planning on staying in and doing your surfing on the Web, or wearing those socklike beach shoes that were briefly fashionable last year for no discernible reason. Instead of shoving the offending appendages out of sight, why not seize the moment to look at them, assess the damage and move toward rehabilitation?</p>

        <p>Since most foot deformities are the result of years of abuse, there is no quick fix. First you have to find shoes that fit properly, which sounds simple but is actually very difficult. Paul Moorefield, who with his partner, Joan Silverman, owns Oliver Moore, a store where you can buy custom-made shoes or hard-to-find sizes, says most people wear shoes that are too small. Having your foot measured by a salesman (which happens rarely enough) is only the beginning. Lasts vary, and it is important to find one that conforms to you. The salesman should be on the floor as you crease the shoe, making certain that the shape of the toe matches your own. Toes should lie flat; the shoe should not press against them. Allow two-thirds of an inch between the longest toe and the end of the shoe. Beware of hidden plastic toe boxes that don't let feet breathe. Fit shoes in the afternoon, when feet are larger. And generally shun any heel more than two inches high. Moorefield winces when he sees young women going off to work in stiletto heels. ''The harm being done to feet is unbelievable.'' Joan Silverman adds, ''It's the most beautiful women who have the ugliest feet.''</p>
        <p>After you get shoes that fit, enroll your feet in yoga class, the only gym activity that allows you to remove your shoes and give feet a workout. Noll Daniel, a yoga instructor at the Chelsea Piers health club and weekly columnist on Efit.com, says some students are reluctant to take off their socks because they say their feet are too ugly. He tells them to love their feet and they will get better. In yoga you learn to articulate every muscle in the foot, to focus on where the foot meets the ground, to spread your toes and not sink into the arch.</p>
        <p>We are not to blame for all foot problems. Karamazov may have been innocent not only of parricide but also of foot abuse. It's possible that his big toe was afflicted with a fungus that makes the nail thick, rough and yellowish. Dr. Paul Kechijian, a professor of dermatology at New York University and in charge of the nail clinic there, says the fungus is omnipresent but infects only those who inherit a susceptibility. Taking Lamisil or Sporonox for four to five months is the cure, but once the medicated nail grows out after about a year, the new nail may be reinfected. To keep the condition in check, he recommends showering at night instead of the morning, using an antibacterial soap and using an over-the-counter antifungal cream like Lotrimin, Micatin or Lamisil.</p>
        <p>Dr. Richard K. Scher, a nail specialist who is professor of dermatology at Columbia, says Diflucan is a pill that works well. For all but the mildest cases, he generally prescribes it for three months, and says that fungus reoccurs in only one out of four patients.</p>
        <p>Karamazov would have felt better about his feet if he'd gone for regular pedicures. Rich feet hop the Concorde every six weeks to see Bastien Gonzalez in Paris at the spas in the Hotels Bristol and Costes. Bastien, a dedicated young man, believes that nails should be buffed, not polished, so they can breathe. He uses a dentist-type drill, but it doesn't have that horrible whine. Finishing with a marble dust cream and chamois cloth makes toenails as pink and shiny as a newborn's. Then there is an intense massage. While Bastien works on the feet, you can also have a facial and bubbling mud bath for the spine (to alleviate jet lag.)</p>
        <p>In case of emergency (e.g. you are shopping in Soho and must buy and wear pony-skin sandals immediately), duck into Oscar Bond on Wooster and ask for Beatriz Najera, who will coddle your feet until they emerge almost as soft and pink as when they danced above your head in the bassinet. Just make sure those sandals fit properly.</p>
