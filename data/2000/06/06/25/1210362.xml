      <abstract>
        <p>San Francisco officials say growing number of people are dying alone, with no one to arrange their funerals, settle their estates or mourn their passing; say 290 people in city died this way so far this year, far higher than annual rate of 300 such deaths in last decade; census figures show that San Francisco has higher population of those over 65, and smaller average household, than national average; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Carmen Ramirez knew people. Born and bred in Managua, Nicaragua, she adopted San Francisco like a doting mother, protecting and fighting for her neighborhood in a way that captured the ear of City Hall. But she lived alone and died last month the same way. By the time anyone noticed her absence, she had been dead, at age 54, for at least a week.</p>
        <p>Lola McKay knew people too. Ms. McKay, an 83-year-old widow, became a symbol for tenants' rights when she refused to leave her apartment on 30 days' notice. For eight years, she was the last tenant in a six-unit building in San Francisco's gentrifying Mission District.  Her case prompted a change in state law, requiring that landlords give elderly and disabled tenants a year's notice before eviction.</p>

        <p>Carmen Ramirez knew people. Born and bred in Managua, Nicaragua, she adopted San Francisco like a doting mother, protecting and fighting for her neighborhood in a way that captured the ear of City Hall. But she lived alone and died last month the same way. By the time anyone noticed her absence, she had been dead, at age 54, for at least a week.</p>
        <p>Lola McKay knew people too. Ms. McKay, an 83-year-old widow, became a symbol for tenants' rights when she refused to leave her apartment on 30 days' notice. For eight years, she was the last tenant in a six-unit building in San Francisco's gentrifying Mission District.  Her case prompted a change in state law, requiring that landlords give elderly and disabled tenants a year's notice before eviction.</p>
        <p>She, too, died as she lived. Her body was discovered in March, weeks after her death. And so it was with Howard Phillips, who was 50 and known on the streets as Allah, a man on close terms with the bottle. In March he died in his small housing authority apartment from complications arising from alcoholism. His body was not discovered until it was in an advanced state of decomposition.</p>
        <p>In San Francisco, the bodies are piling up faster than the city can handle them. More  people are dying alone, with no one to arrange their funerals, settle their estates or mourn their passing. So far this year, 290 people in the city have died this way, said city officials, compared with about 300 a year for the last decade.</p>
        <p>No one is sure exactly why. Officials here say it is too soon to tell whether this is a sign of times to come, here and in the rest of the aging nation. (Officials in New York and Los Angeles report no such increase in the number of people dying alone.)</p>
        <p>But census figures reveal part of the story. In San Francisco, 19 percent of the population is over 65, compared with 14 percent in other major cities. The city has an average household size of 1.29 people, well below the national average. It also has a high number of people whose partners have died of AIDS. San Francisco, boomtown that it is, is also a place where poor, old people are facing what the public administrator, the official responsible for settling the estates of those who die alone, calls ''urban stress.''</p>
        <p>''You have a lot of old people worried that they're going to be evicted from the apartment they've lived in for 30 years,'' said Ricardo Hernandez, the public administrator. The old people have heard all the stories of even well-to-do people unable to find an apartment in the city's surreal, Silicon Valley-fueled housing market. ''We think, that at least in some cases, this is shortening people's lives,'' Mr. Hernandez said.</p>
        <p>The number of people dying alone is climbing  when more homeless people have been dying on the streets of San Francisco over the last five years. Last year, 169 homeless people died on the streets, and so far this year, 78 of the 290 people who have died alone were homeless.</p>
        <p>City officials say that more people are living, and dying, on the streets, as affordable housing throughout the San Francisco Bay area becomes harder to find.</p>
        <p>When indigent people die alone, the medical examiner arranges for their cremation, unless the person was known to belong to a religion that dictates that the body be buried. Basic funerals and a plot in Colma, a town south of San Francisco where many city residents are buried (the city has no cemeteries), cost $7,000; cremations generally cost about $700.</p>
        <p>When the deceased leaves even minimal assets, the public administrator handles the funeral arrangements and begins a sometimes long process of searching for next of kin.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, bodies lie for months in the city morgue as officials search for heirs.</p>
        <p>In the case of Carmen Ramirez, whose cause of death is still being determined, officials found several relatives in the Bay area, who arranged for her funeral.</p>
        <p>That is the exception. The public administrator said his office was often left scrambling to find a relative -- any relative, no matter how remote -- to decide where and how a deceased person would be buried and where the person's  belongings would go.</p>
        <p>''We want to remind everybody to leave a will,'' Mr. Hernandez said, ''if it's just a little note on a piece of paper that says I want so-and-so to have my china.''</p>
        <p>He keeps a room marked ''vault,'' with boxes of personal papers belonging to those whose families have not yet been found. The boxes, piled floor to ceiling on metal shelves, contain the sum total of many lives -- diplomas, yearbooks, military certificates, photo albums, love letters, Christmas cards. The county saves them for five years.</p>
        <p>''We hold on to them,'' said John Clark, deputy to the public administrator, as he sighed over a weathered black-and-white photo, at least 50 years old, of a boy kneeling next to a wire-haired terrier, ''because maybe some relative somewhere will value the memories.''</p>
