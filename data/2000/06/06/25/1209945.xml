        <p>IT happened while I was working out at my local gym not long ago, warming up on a treadmill and humming a jazzy tune. From the treadmill next to me came the sound of a woman giving a speech about economic policy.

        <p>Another time, another song. A man on an adjacent Stairmaster was editing legal articles, scribbling in the margins (and dotting the pages with perspiration) as he listened to music on his headphones.</p>

        <p>IT happened while I was working out at my local gym not long ago, warming up on a treadmill and humming a jazzy tune. From the treadmill next to me came the sound of a woman giving a speech about economic policy. I turned to look, and sure enough, a fellow exerciser was reading out loud from a set of 3-by-5 index cards she held firmly while she ran 12-minute miles.</p>
        <p>Another time, another song. A man on an adjacent Stairmaster was editing legal articles, scribbling in the margins (and dotting the pages with perspiration) as he listened to music on his headphones.</p>
        <p>Still another afternoon, a phone rang. It was the Lifecycle next to me. A man wearing a ''Just Do It'' T-shirt answered his cell phone and gazed up at a ceiling-mounted television tuned to a financial channel. ''Sell!'' he shouted.</p>
        <p>This was beginning to feel like a trend. Eager to learn more, I sought out the man on the Stairmaster and asked him why he had chosen to take his work to his workout.</p>
        <p>He turned out to be Ken Anderson, a 44-year-old law professor at American University in Washington, who replied that he was pressed for time, juggling his family, job and five workouts a week. ''It's the only way I can justify my time at the gym,'' he said. ''I can't afford to be checked out of the day for two straight hours. It's a time management thing.''</p>
        <p>Mark Occhipinti, the president of American Fitness Professionals and Associates, a certification and educational organization in Ship Bottom, N.J., confirms that Mr. Anderson has lots of company. ''It's a fitness trend of big cities and affluent suburbs, where people need information and are very stressed,'' Mr. Occhipinti said. ''It's a symptom of our time.''</p>
        <p>Health clubs, once havens for relaxation, have responded to the new demands by providing equipment that enables members to mix efficiency with exercise. Televisions are tuned to the news, courtesy phones are within easy reach, and at some clubs, Netpulse stations (computers providing Internet access) are attached to Lifecycle and Stairmaster machines. They enable members to do work (and earn frequent-flier miles from Netpulse's airline sponsors for every mile they pedal or step), from their gym-desks.</p>
        <p>''It's a fact of life that people are busy,'' said Maeve McCaffrey, a spokeswoman for the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association, a trade group in Boston. ''If members need to be productive while they exercise, we are going to do everything we can to make it easier for them to enjoy their time at the gym.''</p>
        <p>But not everyone is convinced that this is a good idea. ''Doing anything while on the treadmill is dangerous,'' said Dr. Nicholas DiNubile, an orthopedic surgeon in Havertown, Pa., who is an adviser to the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. ''Talking on cell phones or reading while exercising can cause nerve strain in the head and neck. Workout form is important.''</p>
        <p>Multitasking may be an efficient use of gym time, but it compromises the quality of a workout, said Matt Johns, the former director of operations at the Regency Sport and Health Club in McLean, Va. ''You still burn calories, but the workout is not the same,'' he said. ''There has to be a mind-body connection.''</p>
        <p>Dr. David Brown, a behavioral scientist with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that although there was little research on working while working out, ''in general, disassociating from the exercise experience, by doing something other than exercise, can lead to risks.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Occhipinti knows that firsthand: he once saw a man fall and break his arm while reading on a treadmill. But he adds that health clubs are reluctant to reproach their clients. ''It's a delicate situation,'' he said. ''You don't want to offend or upset the client. We try to educate them about safety, but people are going to do what they want to do.''</p>
        <p>Richard Cotton, the chief exercise physiologist for the American Council on Exercise, a nonprofit watchdog organization in San Diego, agreed. ''Clubs provide all sorts of equipment -- TV's, Netpulse, E-Zone,'' he said. ''It would be difficult to tell someone not to use it.''</p>
        <p>Beyond safety, however, is another concern. Despite the lack of research, many experts share the view that people who take their work to their workout are missing a prime benefit of exercise: its ability to reduce stress. ''Exercise is one of the few leisure activities for relaxation,'' Dr. DiNubile said. ''Working while working out is a missed opportunity at stress reduction.''</p>
        <p>But he won't find much sympathy at my health club. ''Working while working out is stress-reducing,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''I'm away from my office, the computer, and I'm further ahead in my work. It's a sanity-saving device.''</p>
