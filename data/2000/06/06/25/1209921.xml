        <p>The Angel on the Roof</p>
        <p>The Stories of Russell Banks.</p>
        <p>506 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>HarperCollins Publishers. $27.50.</p>
        <p>In the course of nearly 40 years of steady industry, during which he has turned out 13 books of fiction, Russell Banks has allowed his imagination to range freely across time and geography. He has observed the hard realities of life in the contemporary Caribbean in ''The Book of Jamaica'' and ''Continental Drift,'' concocted a creepy, parallel-universe 17th century in ''The Relation of My Imprisonment'' and sung the battle hymn of Harpers Ferry and Bleeding Kansas in ''Cloudsplitter,'' his swollen saga of the life of John Brown. But with the same kind of homing-pigeon intuition that keeps Philip Roth returning to North Jersey in the 1940's and 50's, Banks always circles back to his own native ecosystem -- the bare, wintry towns of central New England and upstate New York in the raw confusion of the present and the recent past.</p>
        <p>In ''The Angel on the Roof,'' a collection of 31 stories, 22 gleaned from four earlier collections of short fiction along with nine that are appearing between hard covers for the first time, Banks pauses to examine the guilty conscience of an American businessman in Africa, the inner life of Edgar Allan Poe and the final musings of Simon Bolivar. But these moments seem anomalous. They detract from the cumulative force of the collection, which comes from its relentless anatomy of contemporary life in the northeastern United States.</p>
        <p>The narrator of two stories is a young man fleeing both the Ivy League and the working class, struggling with marriage and menial employment in Florida; but he is, like so many of Banks's characters (the professor in ''The Book of Jamaica,'' Bob Dubois in ''Continental Drift,'' John Brown himself), a half-willing refugee from the north country. In ''Success Story,'' he goes south in the vain hope of joining Fidel Castro in the Sierra Maestra and winds up settling for a job moving furniture at a hotel. Something tells us this arrangement, and the marriage he literally blunders into, will be temporary. (Marriage, in this world, usually is. The words ''husband'' and ''wife'' are nearly always accompanied by qualifiers like ''first,'' ''third'' or ''ex''). We suspect this young man will grow up to be a writer driven by an unconquerable impulse to return to the place he is trying so hard to purge from his memory.</p>
        <p>At his best, Banks writes with an agonized clarity that seems to spring from temperamental reticence, as if he were being pulled, against his will, back to his origins and to his entwined themes, the mutual betrayals committed against each other by parents and children, men and women, blacks and whites. As the narrator of ''The Visit'' puts it: ''I have traveled a lot in recent years, and consequently have completed almost all my journeys now. And when I have returned to every place where someone beat me or I beat someone, when there is no place left to go back to, then for the rest of my life I will have only my memories, these stories, to go to -- for the heat, for the light, for the awful, endlessly recurring end of it.''</p>
        <p>With some reluctance, despite his periodic dabblings in tropical exoticism, historical mummery and avant-garde narrative technique, Banks belongs to the proud American tradition of regional realism. His body of work is dominated by two novels -- Affliction'' and ''The Sweet Hereafter'' -- that are close to perfect, and their devastating emotional precision arises in large part from their crushing, almost Faulknerian sense of place. Happily -- and also, needless to say, grimly -- in spite of the inclusion of a few youthful curios and one or two stabs at midlife wildness, ''The Angel on the Roof'' deserves to stand alongside them.</p>
        <p>''I have arranged these stories thematically and dramatically, rather than in chronological order or by the titles of the collections in which they originally appeared,'' Banks writes in an author's note, and the result is a book more shapely and coherent than the usual careerist grab bag. People wander from story to story like characters in a vast, fragmentary 19th-century novel.</p>
        <p>Many of the stories take place in New Hampshire, but this is not the New England of Hawthorne's Puritan gloom, Robert Frost's farmer stoicism or Ben and Jerry's granola-capitalist pastoral. Banks's characters are pipe fitters, bookkeepers, day laborers and retired military personnel living in drafty clapboard houses and forgotten trailer parks, where they cling to battered notions of middle-class respectability like barnacles to the bottom of a boat. They are Irish Catholics, French Canadians and deracinated Yankees whose lives and relationships freeze and crack like ponds in winter. Divorce, drunkenness and the estrangement of parents from children darken these stories with the implacable regularity of weather patterns, as though disappointment were a force of nature.</p>
        <p>And then there is the actual weather. One must have been cold a long time to grasp the nuances of wind and snow as surely as Banks does -- or to convey so vividly the sensual and spiritual pleasures of outdoor hockey or ice fishing or an early morning shot of booze. In his fiction, the cold is menacing and cruel, but it's also a source of wisdom and an occasion for poetry. The first two pages of ''The Fisherman'' explore the subtle, almost extrasensory signs of seasonal change: ''If you have an abstract turn of mind, you tend to measure the approach of winter by the sun. . . . Or, on the other hand, you might measure the approach of winter by the ice, which seems a more direct, less abstract and mathematical way of going about it.'' In ''The Defenseman,'' another of Banks's barely fictional alter egos, recalling his childhood in Massachusetts, muses that ''even though my memories of those years are almost completely of summertime, it was the winter that dominated our activities, filling our talk and views of the rest of the world, so that we could not even speak of a place without first mentioning that it enjoyed a kinder climate than ours. Of events that took place in summer, however, I recall only the general condition and have obtained my formal knowledge of the events themselves solely as data. It's as if they could as easily have occurred in someone else's life.''</p>
        <p>The diffident, slightly formal, almost stilted diction in these passages is a hallmark of Banks's prose style. His first- and third-person narratives share a quality of guardedness, a fussy exactness that signifies something more than writerly care. Raymond Carver once remarked that he was more interested in the people he wrote about than in any potential reader. Banks is similarly protective of his characters, and for similar reasons. Like Carver's, his stories bristle with a quiet, stubborn class consciousness, a commitment to protect the dignity of his people against the prurient, condescending sociological scrutiny of the reading class. He observes their quirks of behavior -- a woman breeds guinea pigs by the hundred in her trailer; an old man spends the winter in a shanty on a frozen lake, drinking whiskey and fishing in darkness; a teenager conceives a scheme to sell the hemp that grows wild in the nearby woods to Boston drug dealers -- without turning them into the colorful, comical rustics that populate so much regionalist fiction. Nor are they embodiments of social pathology, in spite of the prevalence of alcoholism, spousal abuse and financial irresponsibility in their lives.</p>
        <p>The preservation of dignity in the face of disaster is one of Banks's favorite themes, as well as the bedrock of his style. In ''The Moor,'' a middle-aged man meets, after 30 years, an older woman, now in her 80's, with whom he once had an affair. The situation is funny, sad and a little ridiculous, but Banks handles it with decorum, doing his best to help the man and woman through their embarrassment, even daring to seal the story with a long, wistful and decidedly erotic kiss. ''Time's come, time's gone, time's never returning,'' the narrator reflects as he drives home. ''What's here in front of me is all I've got, I decide, and as I drive my car through the blowing snow it doesn't seem like much, except for the kindness that I've just exchanged with an old lady, so I concentrate on that.''</p>
        <p>And so does Banks. For all its harshness, ''The Angel on the Roof'' is studded with surprising, hard-won acts of tenderness and decency, which feel more like operations of earthly grace than projections of authorial sentiment. Banks acknowledges that the world is a cold place and redeems it with the warmth of his affection.</p>
