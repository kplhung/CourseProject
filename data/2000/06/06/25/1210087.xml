        <p>Cirque on Film</p>
        <p>The next best thing to seeing Cirque du Soleil in the flesh is to see it on film, and that will be possible from Friday through Sept. 28 at the Maritime Aquarium's Imax theater in South Norwalk.</p>
        <p>''Journey of Man'' tells the story of one man's life from birth through childhood, adolescence, young adulthood and old age. Along the way he travels across the globe and makes his fortune while experiencing all that life has to offer.</p>

        <p>Cirque on Film</p>
        <p>The next best thing to seeing Cirque du Soleil in the flesh is to see it on film, and that will be possible from Friday through Sept. 28 at the Maritime Aquarium's Imax theater in South Norwalk.</p>
        <p>''Journey of Man'' tells the story of one man's life from birth through childhood, adolescence, young adulthood and old age. Along the way he travels across the globe and makes his fortune while experiencing all that life has to offer.</p>
        <p>Scenes were filmed at locations as diverse as the Bahamas and the Brandenberg Gate in Berlin. Enhanced by the experience of an Imax screen, the troupe's extraordinary athleticism and grace as well as its stunning sets and costumes are more arresting than when seen on a stage from afar.</p>
        <p>Performances are scheduled daily at noon, 2 and 4 p.m. Tickets are $6.75, $5.75 for adults over 61 and $5 for children 1 through 12. The number to call for more information is (203) 852-0700. The aquarium is at 10 North Water Street, off Exit 14 of Interstate 95.</p>
        <p>Floral Watercolors on Sale</p>
        <p>An exhibition and sale of floral watercolors by Barbara Novak will be held at the Cooley Gallery in Old Lyme on Monday through Saturday from 10 to 5.</p>
        <p>Ms. Novak retired in 1998 after 42 years as a teacher, artist and theorist of 19th-century American landscape painting at Barnard College in Manhattan. Her exquisite renderings of tulips, iris, lilies and other blooms are deceptively airy and casual, belieing the accuracy of form so deftly drawn and the delicacy of color so skillfully controlled.</p>
        <p>The pictures range in size from 6 by 9 inches to 17 by 23 inches and prices vary from $850 to $3,500. The gallery is at 25 Lyme Street and the number for more information is (860) 434-8807.</p>
        <p>Antique Car Show</p>
        <p>The Housatonic Valley Region Antique Automobile Club of America holds its 25th Antique and Classic Auto Show today from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., rain or shine, at the Bridgewater Fair Grounds on Route 133.</p>
        <p>Twenty-five categories of cars dating from World War 1 through 1975 are expected to be filled by more than 300 entries to be judged for first, second and third prize. Additional prizes will be awarded for Best of Show, Oldest Car and President's Choice. Judging begins at noon.</p>
        <p>Admission for spectators is by donation of $3, children 7 through 12 $1, under 7 and over 64 free.</p>
        <p>The fairgrounds are accessible off Exit 9 of Interstate 84, then Route 25 North, right on Route 133 for 6 miles. The number to call for more information is (203) 775-4719.</p>
        <p>Free Films at Yale</p>
        <p>Movie buffs might as well camp out in New Haven this week, given the avalanche of free films to be presented at Yale.</p>
        <p>Fifteen British films will be shown at 1 p.m. at the Yale Center for British Art, 1080 Chapel Street, in conjunction with the Art of Bloomsbury exhibition. Today through Saturday,  the feature films are ''A Room With a View,'' ''To the Lighthouse,'' ''Women in Love,'' ''Orlando,'' ''Tom and Viv,'' ''Maurice'' and ''Mrs. Dalloway.'' In addition, a documentary is scheduled each day at 11 a.m.</p>
        <p>Across Chapel Street at York, the Yale Art Gallery is presenting a series of double features that combine serious and funny films at 2 p.m. beginning on Tuesday with Buster Keaton in ''The Haunted House'' and Alfred Hitchcock's ''Rebecca.''</p>
        <p>Wednesday's program is a ''Scaredy Cat'' cartoon and ''The Spiral Staircase.''</p>
        <p>Thursday it's an ''Addams Family'' television episode and ''The Haunting,'' and on Friday ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' and ''Edward Scissorhands'' fill the bill.</p>
        <p>The number for recorded information at the Yale Center for British Art is (203) 432-2800, at the gallery (203) 432-0600.</p>
        <p>Annual Butterfly Count</p>
        <p>This is the time of year for the Annual Butterfly Count sponsored by the Xerces Society and the North American Butterfly Association.</p>
        <p>Larry Gall, butterfly and curatorial associate from the Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven, will lead a survey of lepidoptera that are to be found at Sherwood Island State Park, the Fairfield Audubon Center and the Westport Nature Center, where a count will originate on Saturday at 10 a.m. In addition to compiling a local census, Mr. Gall will share his knowledge of butterflies with participating volunteers.  Pre-registration is required by calling (203) 227-7253.</p>
        <p>The nature center is at 10 Woodside Lane, near downtown Westport and the event is free.</p>
        <p>A Go at Jane Austen</p>
        <p>The Connecticut chapter of JASNA -- the Jane Austen Society of North America -- will hold a ''Pride and Prejudice'' brain-teaser event today from 2 to 4:30 p.m. at the Westbrook Public Library.</p>
        <p>Visitors are expected to take an active part in the proceedings as follows: select characters from the book and talk about what those characters would be doing 10 years later; also, be prepared to pose five questions about the book that are designed to stump the group.</p>
        <p>There is no charge for the program or refreshments, but donations will be appreciated.</p>
        <p>To reach the library turn left on Burdick Drive off Route 1, then take the first right off Burdick Drive.</p>
        <p>The number to call for more information about the event is (860) 399-7618.</p>
