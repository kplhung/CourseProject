        <p>IT was a sad season for the state's professional theaters, if attention is to be paid to the Connecticut Critics Circle awards, which are being doled out this afternoon at Southern Connecticut State University.</p>
        <p>Only Hartford Stage came off with top awards: best production and direction for Michael Wilson's staging of ''Camino Real.'' No prize for a new play. But Long Wharf walked away with what seems to be the season's knee-jerk award for good intentions gone astray: ''Good Person of New Haven,'' a sentimentalized, name-dropping view of the city by a Los Angeles-based company.</p>
        <p>And it was a sad night earlier this month when two major players in the Connecticut and New York theater were honored with special Tony Awards on June 4, yet neither was allowed to take a bow.</p>
        <p>Eileen Heckart, a longtime resident of the state, and Sylvia Herscher, the very model of a non-profit theater trustee, were not granted a moment of television time to receive the honor, or to say a word.</p>
        <p>Last year, one would have thought the television producers had descended to the nadir of grace when the legendary Uta Hagen was announced as a recipient of an award, and all the producers allowed was a wave from the great lady, from her seat. But no waves for Ms. Heckart or Ms. Herscher this year.</p>
        <p>Many theatergoers figured that Ms. Hagen's appearance in ''Mrs. Klein'' at the Stamford Center for the Arts in 1996 would be her farewell to the stage, but she went on. ''Collected Stories,'' by Connecticut's newest favored playwright, Donald Margulies, was her next play of choice. And she will go on in ''Collected Stories'' at Ontario's Stratford festival this summer.</p>
        <p>For all that, award presentations, the arbitrary and the mishandled, are always and too much with us. In the meantime, an uncertain summer season has begun, with more announcements waiting in the wings.</p>
        <p>Once, the repertory season in Canada was called ''the other festival'' by Connecticut's theatergoers but for more than a decade chauvinist pride has turned into a gnawing question: ''Whither Stratford?'' Ever-changing responses have not provided a credible answer.</p>
        <p>If one calls the American Shakespeare Festival Theater in Stratford, a recorded message will tell of ''delays in construction'' and ask to ''please call back periodically to get updates on our re-opening.'' An inquiry of the administrative office last week elicited the response: ''We're just waiting for the chairs and the carpet to be installed in the new theater.''</p>
        <p>After last season's one-night-only event -- Christopher Plummer backed by the Hartford Symphony in William Walton's ''Henry V'' -- great expectations and promises, promises filled the air. We'll wait for the chairs and for the carpet.</p>
        <p>And Shakespeare is still on -- last time tonight -- at Shakespeare on the Sound in Rowayton. Modest Shakespeare is better than no Shakespeare at all, and it doesn't hurt the Rowayton series that Mr. Plummer, now living in Weston, not only lent his name as honorary chairman but also wrote a message for the program.  And it didn't hurt that Derek Jacobi went to Rowayton to talk to the company before opening.</p>
        <p>It's also curtains for the Royal Shakespeare Company's lavishly praised ''Macbeth'' after today's matinee at the Long Wharf in New Haven. As with the last stage appearances of Eileen Heckart and Uta Hagen, Antony Sher's performance is not a Broadway event; it is part of the International Festival of Arts and Ideas. The other ''Macbeth,'' on Broadway with Kelsey Grammer, closes today, after an unintended limited run, and not as an event.</p>
        <p>Also under the festival banner is the wild and crazy ''Giulio Cesare,'' which also closes today, at the Stamford Center for the Arts. But Steven Berkoff's ''Shakespeare's Villains'' is to be seen at Long Wharf in New Haven, Tuesday through July 1. Instead of waiting for chairs, seekers of Shakespeare around the state, have options, all of which demand making haste.</p>
        <p>While the state's longest-lived professional summer institutions -- the Westport Playhouse, the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford and Lucille Lortel's White Barn in Westport -- are all enduring essential changes, the fact is that they endure.</p>
        <p>Stars will shine over Westport Country Playhouse, which is no surprise with Joanne Woodward in place and with such a title: artistic advisory council co-chairwoman. Ms. Woodward directed the season's opener, ''The Constant Wife'' and is to appear in A. R. Gurney's ''Ancestral Voices,'' a ''Love Letters''-style reading for five actors instead of two, with an entire cast change each week of a two-week run. Fritz Weaver has replaced Jason Robards in the first week, and the estimable Elizabeth Wilson glows among the other stars that week. Swoosie Kurtz, James Naughton and Paul Rudd join Ms. Woodward during the second week. Paul Newman, too.</p>
        <p>The Westport season's second play, written by Austin Pendleton, beginning tomorrow is ''Orson's Shadow.'' The Orson is Welles (real stars do not have to be literally alive). The excellent Jayne Atkinson, a regional theater favorite and a Tony-nomination survivor of the past season, is to appear in ''Triangles for Two,'' a new play by David Wiltse.  And Bronson Pinchot, now in ''The Winter's Tale'' at the New York Shakespeare Festival in Central Park, is in Westport Playhouse's last work, a musical called ''Nicolette and Aucassin.''</p>
        <p>But is it written in stone that it must be the last? What a final show of the season usually means is that it, or the season, can be extended. And here's a rare chance for Westport.</p>
        <p>''The Waverly Gallery,'' the marvelous play in which Ms. Heckart gave an indelible, life-enhancing performance last season, closed prematurely, a sign of significant bad judgement by New York theatergoers. Connecticut's will know better.</p>
        <p>Even though Ms. Heckart announced her retirement from the stage, she did not announce her retirement from her last role. Ms. Woodward went on for Ms. Heckart during the play's Williamstown tryout last summer. She is a good backup and she lives in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>The cry should resound: Get Heckie, as she is fondly called. She lives in the neighborhood, too.</p>
