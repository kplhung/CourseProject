        <p>TAMMY WYNETTE</p>
        <p>A Daughter Recalls Her Mother's</p>
        <p>Tragic Life and Death.</p>
        <p>By Jackie Daly with Tom Carter.</p>

        <p>Tammy Wynette, the first female country singer to have a million-selling album, won her greatest fame with her 1968 hit, ''Stand By Your Man.'' Wynette herself stood by one man too many. Her daughter Jackie Daly writes that when she died at the age of 55 in 1998 she was in her customary fetal position on her couch in the last of her drug-induced stupors with her fifth husband, George Richardson, known as Richey. Wynette became addicted to painkillers like Demerol in the course of her many operations, Daly, the second of Wynette's four daughters, says in ''Tammy Wynette: A Daughter Recalls Her Mother's Tragic Life and Death,'' written with Tom Carter, who has collaborated on memoirs with Reba McEntire and Merle Haggard. Virginia Wynette Pugh had three big things going for her: talent, determination and beauty-queen looks. After two early marriages that fizzled, Wynette met and married her longtime idol, George Jones, who was the best man by far for her and her girls. ''Jones wasn't merely like a father to me and my sisters,'' Daly writes. ''He was our father.'' While the book is awkwardly written and jumps dizzily in time, it does reveal much about Wynette, the country music business and addiction. And there are some amusing anecdotes. Watching television during the Gennifer Flowers escapade in 1992, Wynette heard Hillary Rodham Clinton say, ''I'm not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.'' Wynette was shocked, her daughter writes. ''What?'' Wynette said. ''Why is she involving me in this thing?'' Wynette demanded and won an apology from the first lady.</p>
