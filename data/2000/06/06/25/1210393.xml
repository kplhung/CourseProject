        <p>Senator John McCain is still letting the chips fall where they may.</p>
        <p>Last week, while urging a House committee to tighten regulations on tax-exempt political groups, which do not have to tell who gives them money or how they spend it, the Arizona Republican likened their work to ''certain evils in our society,'' namely murder, rape and robbery.</p>
        <p>That was too much for House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, who has close ties to a number of the groups and who disagrees strongly with Mr. McCain on the need for an overhaul of campaign finance laws. He struck back, unusually hard for a fellow Republican, asserting that Mr. McCain was trying to curb free speech by demanding that the groups name donors and detail the political activity their donations support, like advertising.</p>
        <p>''You have offended good Americans and you should apologize,'' Mr. DeLay declared. ''By employing emotionally overwrought rhetoric that places Americans contributing to these groups on the same level as evil criminals, you rashly condemn many citizens who are simply pursuing  their First Amendment right to join the debate.'</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain responded that Mr. DeLay seemed nervous about the possibility that a campaign finance measure just might pass. As for whether he would apologize, he recalled the answer the surrounded American commander gave in the Battle of the Bulge in World War II when the German commander demanded that he surrender:</p>
        <p>Nuts.</p>
