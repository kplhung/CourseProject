        <p>ETHELYN BOWERS had a master's degree, an executive-level job and a husband who was a doctor with access to some of the best medical care available. But her accomplishments and connections seemed to make little difference when she endured the premature births and subsequent deaths of three babies, two of whom were in a set of triplets.</p>
        <p>A competitive businesswoman who is immersed in her career and the hectic schedules of her surviving children, now 9 and 11, Ms. Bowers is candid about her losses but does not dwell on their possible causes. ''I just chalked it up to bad luck, mainly,'' said Ms. Bowers, a sales director for Lucent Technologies who lives with her family in Livingston, N.J.</p>
        <p>But her husband is haunted by the notion that somehow, in a way experts have yet to fully grasp, the fact that he and his wife are African-American was a factor in their children's deaths.</p>
        <p>''At the time of the loss, you really don't dissect out the reasons; all you really think about is the tremendous sorrow,'' said her husband, Dr. Charles H. Bowers, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn. ''In retrospect,  I think you need to look at psychosocial causes -- the euphemism I use for racism. If in fact my counterpart, a white physician making six figures, had a wife the same age and her likelihood of losing their child was less than half of my wife's chances of losing my child, why should that be?''</p>
        <p>It is a mystery that consumes not only Dr. Bowers but a growing field of researchers struggling to explain a persistent racial gap in American infant mortality rates. For years, the number of babies who die before their first birthday has been a source of shame for public health advocates; in international comparisons of infant mortality, the World Health Organization has ranked the United States 25th, below Japan, Israel and Western Europe. But even as infant mortality rates improve -- to a record low national average of 7.2 deaths per 1,000 live births -- the disparity between blacks and whites has grown, from 2 to nearly 2.4 times the number of infant deaths.</p>
        <p>Especially troubling is evidence that this is not simply a function of poverty. While college-educated black women do better than impoverished, they are still twice as likely to bury their babies as their white counterparts. And immigrants have better pregnancy outcomes than assimilated minorities. What happens to their health once they settle here, and And why haven't education, better jobs and prenatal care made a bigger difference in closing the infant mortality gap?</p>
        <p>''There's no single answer,'' said Dr. Solomon Iyasu, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. ''Infant mortality is such a complex issue because it's driven both by medical issues as well as by social issues.''</p>
        <p>Because premature deliveries and low birth weights account for two-thirds of infant deaths, much recent research has focused on the causes of early labor. Medical complications from diabetes and high blood pressure, more prevalent illnesses in African-Americans, can be blamed for some of the cases but do not account for the huge disparity. So researchers have begun exploring more subtle factors, like crime, pollution and family support. Another hypothesis is that chronic stress caused by racial discrimination can elevate hormones that set off premature labor.</p>
        <p>''We're starting to think it's something about lifelong minority status,'' said Dr. James W. Collins Jr., a neonatologist in Chicago who teaches pediatrics at Northwestern University Medical School.</p>
        <p>Dr. Collins has compared the newborns of black women born in the United States to those of mothers who came directly from Africa, and found that the immigrants' babies were bigger, with birth weights more comparable to whites than to African-Americans. Another study involving interracial couples indicated that the mother's race was crucial: babies born to black mothers and white fathers had higher rates of low birth weight.</p>
        <p>The intergenerational effects of poverty and discrimination are also being explored amid concerns that a woman's health and personal experiences -- even before she becomes pregnant -- can affect her children's health.</p>
        <p>''It's not clear that if you have a woman who's first-generation college-educated that she's still not carrying the risks of generations of poverty,'' said Dr. Marie McCormick, a pediatrician and professor of child and maternal health at the Harvard School of Public Health. ''There is also increasing evidence that having been born with a low birth weight yourself, you're more likely to have a low-birth-weight child.''</p>
        <p>Stress-fueled hormones can also lower resistance to infection, Dr. Collins said, and black women have higher rates of vaginal infection, which can spread to the uterus and induce early labor. In locating the source of those infections, which are not sexually transmitted, some researchers have begun looking at douching, a more common practice among black women than white, according to Dr. Dawn Misra, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
        <p>After premature births, the second leading cause of infant deaths is SIDS, or sudden infant death syndrome. SIDS rates have dropped about 40 percent since 1992, when the American Academy of Pediatrics began a campaign to put babies on their backs or sides to sleep instead of on their stomachs. But African-American infants continue to die of SIDS at twice the rate of other babies, leading researchers to wonder whether the message is reaching black parents.</p>
        <p>As the head obstetrician for Bronx clinics run by Montefiore Medical Center, Dr. Nereida Correa gives all her patients a booklet on SIDS and arranges for a pediatrician to attend at least one prenatal session to review infant safety and care. Because most of her patients are poor black and Hispanic women whose Medicaid coverage ends six weeks after giving birth, Dr. Correa tries to pack in as much advice as she can.</p>
        <p>On a recent morning at the Williamsbridge clinic, Dr. Correa's patients included Monica Lightbourne, who had been fired from her job as a Kmart sales manager and was fighting the store and the state unemployment board as she entered her 36th week of pregnancy. Another patient, Beverly Roman, who was not pregnant, recalled the death of her first child, a month-old daughter, in Jamaica nearly 20 years ago, after a malnourished teenage pregnancy.</p>
        <p>Dr. Correa, who grew up poor in Manhattan, listens patiently to all their concerns and still manages to see three to four women an hour on a slow day. Despite their risks, her patients generally deliver healthy babies, and Dr. Correa remains a believer in the power of prenatal care. The problem, she said, is her patients' lack of health insurance when they are not pregnant.</p>
        <p>Dr. McCormick also considers insurance an important piece of the infant mortality puzzle. ''Over all, I don't think we take care of our mothers and children very well,'' she said. ''We have a patchwork system of health care. Other countries have financial support for child care and young families and longer maternity leaves and some sort of national health insurance coverage, and I think over time all this adds up.'' Still, insurance and quality care were not issues for the Bowers.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bowers was on staff at Mount Sinai when his wife's preterm deliveries occurred; her own doctor was the chairman of obstetrics. Their first son, Russell, was stillborn at 23 weeks in 1986. Two years later, Ms. Bowers was pregnant with triplets when a checkup revealed that a fetus had died in utero at 28 weeks. She eventually delivered two girls, each weighing about a pound and a half. One, Erin, died a month later after developing a bowel infection. The second daughter, Charlynn, survived. In 1991, Ms. Bowers delivered a full-term boy, Carlton, who weighed 8 pounds, 6 ounces.</p>
        <p>Today, Dr. Bowers is part of a committee that investigates local fetal and infant deaths and was set up by the Northern New Jersey Maternal Child Health Consortium. He also raises money for research.</p>
        <p>''The hardest thing in my life has been losing my babies,'' he said. ''I've had a very good life. I've got three great kids, but I should have had six.''</p>
