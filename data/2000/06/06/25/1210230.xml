        <p>TO drive the new Toyota MR2 Spyder is to appreciate the Mazda MX-5 Miata all over again. For more than a decade, an eternity for a sports car, the plucky little Mazda roadster has defined the road-going romantic idyll. The Miata is small, even intimate, with a trunk that can handle a couple's bags for a romantic weekend getaway. Leave the golf clubs at home; you're going no farther than the hot tub.</p>
        <p>The Miata is also a terrific little open-top sports car, with whip-smart handling, excellent balance and an eager, high-revving engine. For a generation of older-but-wiser fans of British sports cars, the affordable Miata delivered all the windblown pleasures of the old MG's and Triumphs without fear of being becalmed by mechanical failures.</p>

        <p>TO drive the new Toyota MR2 Spyder is to appreciate the Mazda MX-5 Miata all over again. For more than a decade, an eternity for a sports car, the plucky little Mazda roadster has defined the road-going romantic idyll. The Miata is small, even intimate, with a trunk that can handle a couple's bags for a romantic weekend getaway. Leave the golf clubs at home; you're going no farther than the hot tub.</p>
        <p>The Miata is also a terrific little open-top sports car, with whip-smart handling, excellent balance and an eager, high-revving engine. For a generation of older-but-wiser fans of British sports cars, the affordable Miata delivered all the windblown pleasures of the old MG's and Triumphs without fear of being becalmed by mechanical failures.</p>
        <p>Now comes the MR2 Spyder, another overachieving, underpriced sports car intended to win over Miata fans. But, alas, even in Virginia the MR2 is not for lovers.</p>
        <p>Because of its midengine design -- the motor is behind the seats and slightly ahead of the rear axle -- the MR2 has no trunk. Storage is limited to a plastic bin behind the seats (you have to move the seats to get to it) about the size of a viola case, plus a smaller-than-a-breadbox cubbyhole in the nose, next to the spare tire. Thus, a simple trip to the supermarket becomes an exercise in Solomonic reasoning: Who gets to sit in the passenger seat, your spouse or the groceries? As for a cozy weekend getaway, unless you're headed for a nudists' retreat, forget it. Carry-on bags are not allowed.</p>
        <p>In this way, the MR2 has a strangely feral feel, as a car that must be enjoyed alone -- quite a contrast to the congenial Miata. Toyota could answer quite reasonably that utility was never part of the car's mission statement. Yet this seems a miscalculation to someone who has spent a week in the MR2. A car with no storage is merely a toy, and toys, as the Plymouth Prowler proves, become boring.</p>
        <p>By the numbers, the MR2 and the Miata are strikingly similar. At 153 inches, the Toyota is a couple of inches shorter than the Mazda, though the MR2 is slightly wider and taller. The MR2 is a few pounds lighter, too, and the Miata can be weighed down more with luxury options that Toyota does not offer. Both cars are powered by 1.8-liter, 4-cylinder aluminum engines, though the MR2's variable valve timing gives it the edge in usable torque (125 foot-pounds at 4,400 r.p.m., compared with the Miata's 119 foot-pounds at 5,500 r.p.m.).</p>
        <p>In some respects, the MR2 seems derivative. The top latches appear to have come from the same supplier who sells to Mazda.</p>
        <p>Stylistically, however, the two cars come from different sides of the drafting table. Compared with the Miata, with its lozenge-like curves, the MR2 is crisply geometric, with slab sides punctuated by scalloped air ducts and an anthropomorphic face reminiscent of Mike Mulligan's steam shovel -- all grin and bright eyes. The rear of the car features a long louvered decklid and prominent taillights above a Ferrari-like rear grille. From this angle, the current Spyder has more in common with the first-generation MR2 of the late 1980's -- itself a riff on the old Fiat X1/9 -- than its immediate forebear, a Mini-Me of the Ferrari Testarossa.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Miata, whose top folds down with the inside panel exposed to the elements, the MR2's top folds in a Z pattern, leaving the canvas clamped down behind the seats and minimizing the need for the tonneau cover.</p>
        <p>Inside, the MR2 is well organized and comfortable, with simply superb bolstered buckets that you may be tempted to unbolt and install in your living room. The bluff and upright dash keeps the climate and audio controls nicely separate. Handsome materials, like brushed aluminum and dimpled vinyl on the steering wheel, dash and door pulls, provide a serenely technical feel.</p>
        <p>The Achilles' heel of any midengine car is packaging, since the engine takes up so much prime real estate close to the driver. Yet in terms of sound, the MR2's engine seems isolated from the cabin. It makes its presence known under hard acceleration, as it should, with a hoarse, mechanical burr; but in the putter of city streets it remains pleasantly sotto voce.</p>
        <p>Legroom is ample for a small midengine car (compared with the cruelties of the X1/9, for instance), allowing you to move the seat forward for a few degrees of seat-back rake. Credit the MR2's expansive wheelbase of 96.5 inches, which sets the wheels in the far precincts of the fenders.</p>
        <p>Considering its myriad packaging problems, why bother with a midengine design, anyway? Because placing the engine near the center of the car allows it to turn more quickly, like a pirouetting skater with her arms drawn in tight. For pure performance, nothing beats a lightweight, midengine, rear-drive car -- as a glance at the grid of the Indy 500 will tell you.</p>
        <p>And the MR2's performance is sparkling: lively, alert and well composed, the car makes even transitions from one sliding corner to another. The rack-and-pinion steering answers instantly to command, and the sensations from the tires feed up through the wheel so you intuitively know what each wheel is doing at all times. Considering how much steel is in the car's unit body, the MR2 is remarkably light (about 2,200 pounds unloaded). The independent suspension (struts and springs with control links) is supple but firm, giving up a few inches of body lean in corners before stiffening in a muscular, shoulder-down stance.</p>
        <p>Toyota wisely chose to put 15-inch radials on the car. Bigger tires might have given the car more overall grip (and filled in what appear to be overly generous wheel wells), but the ride would have suffered without really improving the car's fun quotient.</p>
        <p>As it is, the toggle-like gearshift, well-placed pedals and hearty antilock brakes make this a wildly amusing car to drive. The MR2 dances and darts like an aerobatic kite in a stiff spring breeze.</p>
        <p>All of which leaves the MR2 in a virtual dead heat with the Miata in general joie de vivre. So why would anyone choose the MR2 over a gold-plated classic with a trunk? Cheap exclusivity, for one thing. There are about a quarter-million Miatas running around the United States. The MR2 will be sold in limited numbers, only 5,000 a year.</p>
        <p>So if you buy an MR2, you will definitely turn some heads. And you will have bought a car with the impeccable fit and finish of a Toyota and the oaken solidity of a car costing thousands more. If only it didn't make you feel so lonely.</p>
