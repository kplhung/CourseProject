        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Regarding the article ''Behind Bedford School Budget Fight: Economic and Ethnic Divisions'' last Sunday:</p>
        <p>As I read the article, at first I was angered.</p>
        <p>After finishing the article I was incensed.</p>
        <p>To say that the Bedford school budget was voted down because of ethnic division is totally without fact. The reason that your reporter could find nobody to be quoted about the ''largely unspoken resentment'' toward the Hispanic population is because it is a small, very small number of people who feel this way -- if there are any at all.</p>
        <p>As one of the 606 Bedford Village voters to vote no on this budget, I did not do it because I am anti-Hispanic, as your article implies.</p>
        <p>I voted no because the Bedford school board spends money as if they have unlimited money.</p>
        <p>As a middle-class, tax-paying New Yorker, it is tough enough making ends meet. But when the cost of living goes up only 3 percent and the school board wants a raise of 8.5 percent, something is wrong.</p>
        <p>Everybody wants better schools, but to keep on throwing money at the schools is not the answer.</p>
        <p>We tell children to not waste the money we give them each week. To be careful and spend that money wisely, and by doing this we try to teach them to live within their means.</p>
        <p>Why can't the Bedford school board learn this lesson?</p>
