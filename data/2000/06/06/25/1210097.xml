        <p>Making Practice Perfect</p>
        <p>Clumsy fingers, stiff lips, fuzzy tone, lack of coordination.</p>
        <p>Sound serious?</p>
        <p>It is, according to a group of older teenagers who were recruited to advise younger children.</p>
        <p>This is not about drugs, by the way. It's about flutes. And pianos. And cellos. And what happens if you don't practice almost every single day.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, it's about survival, as in ''The Young Musician's Survival Guide,'' a book by Amy Nathan, a Larchmont author. Ms. Nathan started out by asking 200 beginning musicians, ages 10 to 14, what bugs them about learning to play an instrument. Then she took their gripes to 150 musicians between the ages of 16 and 19, as well as 19 professionals, including the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and the solo percussionist Evelyn Glennie.</p>
        <p>The result is a book filled with practical advice about how to find time to practice, how to calm down before playing in public and how to handle that chatterbox who sits behind you at rehearsal.</p>
        <p>The Survival Guide, priced at $9.95, was published earlier this year by Oxford University Press. And, by the way, if some of the young musicians in its pages look familiar, it may be because you've attended concerts at Mamaroneck High School, the scene of a photo session for the book.</p>
        <p>Awards for Well-Told Stories</p>
        <p>Anne Izzard loved a good story.</p>
        <p>That's why there's a storytellers' award given in her name by the Westchester County Library System, where Ms. Izzard worked for many years as children's services consultant.</p>
        <p>What makes a winner? The contest rules take a clear stand in an age when so much entertainment depends on bombarding people with high-tech sights and sounds. Here it's the words that matter. The story must succeed on its own, without the help of illustrations, graphic presentation of audio-visual media.</p>
        <p>These were the books that were honored as winners of the fifth Anne Izzard Storytellers' Choice Award in a ceremony Tuesday at Mamaroneck Library: ''Lucy Dove'' by Janice Del Negro; ''Zzzng! Zzzng! Zzzng! A Yoruba Tale'' by Phillis Gerhator; ''Spirit of the Cedar People'' by Chief Lelooska and Christine Normandin; ''The Troll With No Heart in His Body and Other Tales of Trolls From Norway'' by Lisa Lunge-Larsen; ''The Power of Personal Storytelling: Spinning Tales to Connect With Others'' by Jack Maguire; ''Let My People Go: Bible Stories Told by a Freeman of Color'' by Patricia and Frederick L. McKissack; ''The Way of the Human Being'' by Calvin Luther Martin; ''Why Leopard Has Spots: Dan Stories From Liberia'' by Won-Ldy Paye and Margaret H. Lippert; ''Hearsay: Strange Tales From the Middle Kingdom'' by Barbara Ann Porte; ''You Never Know: A Legend of the Lamed-Vavniks'' by Francine Prose; ''A Coat for the Moon and Other Jewish Tales'' by Howard Schwartz and Barbara Rush; ''The Storytellers' Journey: An American Revival'' by Joseph Sobol; and ''Gray Heroes: Elder Tales From Around the World'' by Jane Yolen.</p>
        <p>And Speaking of Storytelling . . .</p>
        <p>The Rye Free Reading Room Public Library is recruiting for Book Buddies, a storytelling group for students who are about to enter grades six through eight.</p>
        <p>First, the young teenagers will have three training sessions with Neva Winter, a founder of the Rye Storytellers' Guild and a former Milton School librarian. (The training begins this Wednesday.) Then they will perform puppet plays, read stories and help with crafts at Children's Room programs, including a bedtime story hour when storytellers and audience are invited to come dressed in pajamas.</p>
        <p>For information about this and other programs, including book discussions for middle schoolers, contact Carol Brennan, the young adult librarian, at (914) 967-0480.</p>
        <p>When an Address Pays Off</p>
        <p>If you've got a Putnam County address, the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival has a deal for you.</p>
        <p>Next Friday night, and again on Aug. 4, it's offering reduced-price tickets for Putnam residents, with the help of a new grant from the Putnam Arts Fund. Tickets are $14 for adults, and $10 for students 18 and under. (Usually Friday night tickets cost $28 for adults). ''Measure for Measure,'' directed by Terrence O'Brien, continues through July 30. ''The Taming of the Shrew,'' directed by Nick Mangano, runs July 19 through Aug. 27. Box office: (914) 265-9575.</p>
        <p>Planning Ahead</p>
        <p>The Music Conservatory of Westchester has begun registration for fall classes. For information, contact the registrar, Coni Guhl, at (914) 761-3900 or by e-mail at coni @musiced.org. Those who enroll for fall classes will be able to help celebrate when the school moves from 20 Soundview Avenue in White Plains to its new home, at 216 Central Avenue, scheduled to open Jan. 6.</p>
