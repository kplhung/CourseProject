        <p>WHEN the notice arrived in my mailbox, full of mysterious legal blather, I realized that a Nimby battle was about to unfold, literally at my front door.</p>
        <p>I couldn't make sense of the information in the announcement of a public hearing before the Planning Board of the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson. Something about the six ''personal wireless service facilities,'' which would be attached to light poles.</p>
        <p>But the list of locations was unambiguous: 1 Hudson Street, 104 Overlook Road, 1 Ashley Road, 88 Mount Hope Boulevard, 67 Washington Avenue, 34 Euclid Avenue. One of those was my house. The light pole in question was so close that I shut my blinds against its glare. I had no idea what a ''personal wireless service facility'' was, but I was pretty sure I didn't want one.</p>
        <p>I'd reported more than a few not-in-my-backyard scrums, Westchester's favorite contact sport, and watched others from the sidelines. Would Stew Leonard's monument to Middle American appetite destroy life as we knew it? What about a Shop Rite on Saw Mill River Road? An assisted-living community on the banks of the Hudson?</p>
        <p>I couldn't see any of those sites from my porch. Plus, defying political correctness, I rather liked living someplace with ugly mini-malls, surrounded by acres of parking and roadside Carvel stands, near enough to visit but not where I live. Thus I found my neighbors' Nimby fervor amusing at best and hypocritical at worst, as when I catch them headed to one of the hated establishments, with a protest sticker on the bumper of their car.</p>
        <p>Now I was one of those people.</p>
        <p>Unaware that all households within 300 feet of the aforementioned light poles had already been notified, I scurried to distribute the letter in my neighborhood. At the swimming pool, the greengrocer and the nail salon, I grilled everyone about ''personal wireless service facilities'' and Metricom, the California company courting us for our light poles. All of us assumed -- incorrectly, as it turned out -- that we were threatened with cellular phone towers, which had been beaten back at one location in town but were going up at another.</p>
        <p>Ben Indig, a neighbor and former Village Board member, had consulted his father, a retired engineer, who was concerned about health hazards, property values and what the things would look like. Craig Beazer, a lawyer with a toddler and a new baby on the way, had gone on the Web, learning that no studies directly linked cellular towers to cancer. But the research was financed by telecommunication concerns.</p>
        <p>I, too, went on the Web, to Metricom's site, and squinted through screens of incomprehensible information. The system Metricom hoped to introduce in Westchester County, called Ricochet, is a ''mobile data access service,'' which would provide ''wireless connectivity at 128 kbps,'' by way of ''shoebox-sized radio transceivers.''</p>
        <p>Huh?</p>
        <p>But after an exchange of e-mail with The Times's techno-wizard, John Markoff, I was ready to star at the hearing. John explained that Ricochet, which he had tried when it began in San Francisco at 20 kbp, was a system of mobile computing that had nothing to do with cell phones.</p>
        <p>He said that ''the slight amount of ionizing radiation coming from the boxes is minuscule compared to the soup that we live in'' and that the 128 kbps was more than twice the speed of an analog modem but nowhere near as fast as a DSL line. He said that the technology ''should be ahead of the pack for a couple of years'' and that I would have particularly good service because I was so close to the light pole.</p>
        <p>Boy, did I feel smart heading to Village Hall. Mr. Indig was there. So was Mr. Beazer, who left work early, and Frank Jackson, a retired police officer, who  skipped a visit with his grandchilden. Barbara Merling arrived breathless, halfway through packing the camp trunk. Ms. Merling lives near a different light pole, thus not in our little crowd, but she was a seasoned Nimby warrior, leader of the movement to stop the retirement community.</p>
        <p>The hearing, to our surprise, had been postponed. Metricom was not ready with maps the board had requested. We'd have known this if we had signed onto the village Web site. Who knew the village had a Web site? Who had a spare minute to look? Citizenship is time-consuming.</p>
