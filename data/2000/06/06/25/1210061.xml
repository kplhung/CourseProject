        <p>The Frasch Building at Rector and West Streets, overlooking Battery Park City, is dedicated to the ''Sulfur King.'' So it should not have surprised Tony Goldman, as he set out to convert the little office building into a residential condominium, that the going would get -- well -- sulfurous.</p>
        <p>He entered into a contract to buy the Frasch Building for $1.5 million from the 33 Rector Street Ltd. corporation, which Mr. Goldman and his associates understood to be connected with the Tsakos shipping family of Greece. That was six years ago.</p>

        <p>The Frasch Building at Rector and West Streets, overlooking Battery Park City, is dedicated to the ''Sulfur King.'' So it should not have surprised Tony Goldman, as he set out to convert the little office building into a residential condominium, that the going would get -- well -- sulfurous.</p>
        <p>He entered into a contract to buy the Frasch Building for $1.5 million from the 33 Rector Street Ltd. corporation, which Mr. Goldman and his associates understood to be connected with the Tsakos shipping family of Greece. That was six years ago.</p>
        <p>What happened since was a battle that reached the State Court of Appeals and also played out in federal Bankruptcy Court. Resolution was delayed in 1998 by the death of one of the judges handling the case, Lewis R. Friedman of State Supreme Court, who was stricken while exercising in his gym.</p>
        <p>The crux of the issue was that 33 Rector Street Ltd. wanted to get out of the contract. It asserted at first that the contract could not be honored because it had not been approved by the majority shareholder, said Mark A. Harmon of Bondy &amp; Schloss, a lawyer for Mr. Goldman. (A call to a lawyer for 33 Rector Street Ltd. was not returned.) Mr. Goldman sued to compel performance. The contract was declared enforceable in State Supreme Court, Mr. Harmon said, and the finding was affirmed by the Appellate Division. The Court of Appeals would not hear the case, letting the decision stand. Another effort by 33 Rector Street Ltd. to have the contract voided as part of a bankruptcy proceeding was also rebuffed in State Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>''They lost everything and we won everything,'' Mr. Goldman said last week by phone from Miami Beach, one of three cities in which he is busily renovating properties. (Philadelphia is the other.) ''The litigation is all over and we get on with life.''</p>
        <p>Twelve full-floor lofts with 2,400 square feet of raw space are being offered, at prices from $800,000 to $1.2 million. Thomas Elliott of Goldman Properties said units could be divided into as many as four bedrooms. New windows have been cut out of the south wall, opening panoramic views of the harbor. The architect is Bruce Cutler of Hustvedt-Cutler in Manhattan. The construction cost is $3 million. The project benefits from an 8-year full abatement on real estate taxes and a 10-year full exemption from an increase in taxes due to the improvement.</p>
        <p>The top two floors of the 15-story structure will be occupied by the former owners, as part of a settlement reached after the final court ruling. The ground floor is to be a restaurant. ''There's an untapped demand here for good restaurants,'' said Etai Har-El of Goldman Properties. Occupancy of the building is expected to begin Aug. 1.</p>
        <p>In the lobby vestibule is a tablet noting, without explanation, that the building is a ''memorial tribute'' to Herman Frasch (1851-1914), founder of the Union Sulphur Company. He devised methods of mining sulfur and removing it from petroleum, to the benefit of the Standard Oil Company, whose headquarters were only five blocks away.</p>
