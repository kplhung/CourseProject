        <p>Lawyers in private practice in New York who previously spent 10 years or more of work as prosecutors, whether at local or federal level, find different ways to sort out the two sides of their careers; some shun entire classes of cases that were part of their prosecution routine, while others base their professional comfort levels on their perceptions of individual defendants; some find criminal-defense practice just as challenging and rewarding as their old jobs; others say that while they are their own bosses in private practice, they also have to pay their own bills; photo (M)</p>

        <p>For 16 years, Jonathan Frank was an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, prosecuting cases from the little-known to the notorious, like the one in 1998 in which a man was convicted of a triple murder and received the first death sentence under New York State's current capital punishment law.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Frank, who is 42, is in private practice at a large law firm, dealing with civil litigation and with criminal defense involving business fraud.

        <p>For 16 years, Jonathan Frank was an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, prosecuting cases from the little-known to the notorious, like the one in 1998 in which a man was convicted of a triple murder and received the first death sentence under New York State's current capital punishment law.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Frank, who is 42, is in private practice at a large law firm, dealing with civil litigation and with criminal defense involving business fraud. He wants nothing to do, he says, with defending anyone charged with a violent crime. ''I've seen too much horror, tragedy, pain and suffering from victims and their families,'' he said of his days as a prosecutor, which ended last year.</p>
        <p>Then there is Bradley D. Simon, who was a federal prosecutor for 11 years before he began a one-man private practice in 1998. Mr. Simon, who is 44, sizes up potential clients more by character than criminal category. He has no reservations about representing young people whose ''immaturity and lack of judgment'' had led them into serious crime, he says, but he has declined some cases involving career criminals he considered ''beyond redemption.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Frank and Mr. Simon are known in New York's legal world as  ''double-digit crossovers,'' members of a relatively small fraternity of veteran prosecutors who waited a decade -- sometimes much more -- before they decided to cross the career tracks to private practice. Some, like Mr. Frank, shun entire classes of cases that were part of their prosecution routine. Others, like Mr. Simon, base their professional comfort levels on their perceptions of individual defendants.</p>
        <p>Some find a criminal-defense practice just as challenging as prosecution work, even uplifting. Still others find the transition to private practice a double-edged sword: they are their own bosses, but they have to pay their own bills.</p>
        <p>In New York City, it is common for young law school graduates or relative novices in private practice to seek experience by staffing the state prosecution offices in the five boroughs and the federal prosecution offices in Manhattan and Brooklyn,  then move on or return to private practice after several years. The typical stint in the five district attorney's offices and the two United States attorney's offices is five to seven years.</p>
        <p>Those who wait much longer to depart, lawyers and prosecutors themselves say, are more likely to have developed strong views about the cases or clients they are willing to accept, once the desire for new challenges, more income, or both, leads them to make the switch.</p>
        <p>''Someone who's been a prosecutor for 15, 20 years may find it difficult to defend people'' who have been charged with any kind of crime, said Austin V. Campriello, a criminal-defense lawyer who is chairman of the City Bar Association's criminal courts committee. ''It may be mentally hard to make that change.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Campriello was an assistant district attorney in Manhattan for nine years, until 1980. Since then, he has represented an array of criminal defendants, including one of the four men who were convicted in the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, which killed six people.</p>
        <p>But there is also abundant skepticism among the city's lawyers that any significant number in their ranks refuse cases or clients by category, even among those who had been longtime prosecutors.</p>
        <p>''I have not heard of people who turn away cases because they had scruples after having done mob work, drug work, etc.,'' as prosecutors, said Roger B. Adler, whose 25 years in private practice followed 5 years in the Brooklyn district attorney's office.</p>
        <p>''The only ethos I've heard,'' he said, ''is, 'Don't take bogus cash from a counterfeiter and don't take a check from a forger.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Adler, a former chairman of the Brooklyn Bar Association's federal courts committee, also asserted that competition for cases overcame scruples in shaping a lawyer's clientele. ''In the New York litigation market, I think there is an undersupply of cases and an oversupply of lawyers,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, one longtime federal prosecutor who moved to private practice, Matthew E. Fishbein, said that when he made the change three years ago, scruples were indeed something he grappled with.</p>
        <p>He recalled recently that he had left prosecution -- a total of 12 years in the United States attorney's offices in Brooklyn and Manhattan -- partly because he felt ''ready to do something different.'' But he was not certain at the time whether ''something different'' should include representing criminal defendants.</p>
        <p>''With every firm I talked to, I made it very clear that I might not want to do any criminal work,'' said Mr. Fishbein, who had risen from trial prosecutor to chief assistant United States attorney, the No. 2 post, in Brooklyn, and also held that position in Manhattan. ''I wasn't sure how I'd feel switching sides.''</p>
        <p>But when he joined the Manhattan firm of Howard, Darby &amp; Levin, Mr. Fishbein said, he was immediately asked to take over the case of a man charged with money laundering. When he found the man to be basically ''a good and decent'' person, he said, ''I realized that not only could I do the work, but it was something I would like doing.''</p>
        <p>The man pleaded guilty, but that did not change Mr. Fishbein's opinion of him. His case was ''the easiest transition I could have ever imagined,'' said Mr. Fishbein, who is 46. Now with the New York office of Covington &amp; Burling, the Washington-based firm with which Howard, Darby &amp; Levin merged last year, Mr. Fishbein largely represents clients charged with white-collar crimes like securities fraud.</p>
        <p>''As a prosecutor, I never saw the world in black and white,'' he said. ''A person may have committed a crime and has to pay the consequences, but that's not necessarily the only thing that defines a person.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Simon spoke of a similar approach. In his 11 years as a federal prosecutor -- in Washington, on Long Island and in Brooklyn -- he pursued defendants charged with drug trafficking, participation in organized crime rackets and the like. Now, in his Manhattan-based solo practice, he handles a combination of criminal defense and civil litigation.</p>
        <p>''I'm more likely to take a case involving young people, even if it's a serious crime, because immaturity and lack of judgment lead them to get involved with people they should not, as opposed to older people who have made a career of it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He spoke of the different perspective he had gained in his defense work, and how it enabled him to ''care very much'' about some of those young clients. ''You find they have a capacity to lead a productive life,'' he said, but instead they face the possibility of many years in prison -- a prospect Mr. Simon finds starker now than when he was working to send people there.</p>
        <p>''I was never in a federal prison while I was a prosecutor, but now I'm sometimes there several times a week,'' he said of his visits to clients. ''It's a big awakening.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Simon emphasized that he has no regrets about his life as a prosecutor, adding that ''representing the United States in important cases was very gratifying.''</p>
        <p>Nor, he said, did he mean to criticize prosecutors. ''All the prosecutors I know take their jobs very seriously and try to make the right decisions,'' he said. ''You just see it from a different perspective. I'm not saying that one is morally superior to the other.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fishbein similarly spoke of the rewards of working in the public interest, and Mr. Frank, now with the Manhattan office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, one of the country's largest law firms, recalled his prosecution work as meaningful, especially the homicide cases. ''It doesn't get any more serious than taking someone's life,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But after 16 years in the Brooklyn district attorney's office, where he had risen to executive assistant district attorney, ''I had done everything, and a lot more than I expected, and it was time to do something new.'' The financial needs of a family with young children provided added incentives, said Mr. Frank, who was earning $112,500 a year when he left a year ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simon said building a practice has been challenging. ''You have a lot of pressure to pay the bills, to build a practice,'' he said. He added that after expenses, like rent on his Midtown Manhattan office, ''my standard of living hasn't changed'' from that of his later years as a prosecutor, when he earned about $100,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, Mr. Simon said, his automatic pilot forgets that his career has changed at all. Several times since the switch -- when putting his name on the record at the start of a court proceeding -- he has announced, ''Brad Simon for the government,'' prompting chuckles from the judge and prosecutors and startled looks from his clients. ''Over 11 years, I must have said it thousands of times,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frank said he has no confusion about his old and new roles. At Skadden, Arps, he said, ''I'm not going out to a crime scene at 4 in the morning and seeing a body riddled with bullets and people crying.''</p>
