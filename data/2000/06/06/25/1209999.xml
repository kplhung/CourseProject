        <p>ALTHOUGH the boards of most co-ops and condominiums place a premium on having adequate insurance coverage, lawyers and insurance experts say that what many boards do not realize is that the insurance they have probably does not cover risks relating to environmental and pollution hazards that could end up costing tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
        <p>''The standard general liability policies issued in this country either have very limited or absolute exclusions for environmental risks,'' said Andrew M. Schutzman, president of AMS Risk Management and Consulting, an insurance consulting company in Rockville Centre, N.Y.

        <p>ALTHOUGH the boards of most co-ops and condominiums place a premium on having adequate insurance coverage, lawyers and insurance experts say that what many boards do not realize is that the insurance they have probably does not cover risks relating to environmental and pollution hazards that could end up costing tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
        <p>''The standard general liability policies issued in this country either have very limited or absolute exclusions for environmental risks,'' said Andrew M. Schutzman, president of AMS Risk Management and Consulting, an insurance consulting company in Rockville Centre, N.Y. ''And property owners have plenty of exposure to potential environmental problems.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schutzman explained that under most general liability insurance policies, the insurance company specifically excludes risks associated with things like leaking underground fuel storage tanks and exposure to substances like lead, asbestos, carbon monoxide and even dry-cleaning fluids.</p>
        <p>''Not having coverage for such hazards is trouble enough,'' Mr. Schutzman said. ''But what is even more troubling is that when you get a claim for damages caused by an environmental hazard, the dollar amounts of the claims are usually substantial.''</p>
        <p>Eric Kornfeld, a registered architect and executive vice president of management for Heron Ltd., a Manhattan property-management company, said that at least two of the buildings he has managed over the years have had serious -- and expensive -- problems with leaking fuel storage tanks.</p>
        <p>In one building, Mr. Kornfeld said, an oil storage tank installed in the basement developed a leak at the point the tank came in contact with the concrete floor. ''The lime in the concrete attacked the steel and ate a hole in the tank about the diameter of a pencil,'' he said. ''That leak cost the building about $30,000 in cleanup costs.''</p>
        <p>In another building he managed, Mr. Kornfeld said, an underground tank began leaking at one of its seams after an oil delivery man inadvertently overpressurized the tank by overfilling it.</p>
        <p>''He pumped hundreds of gallons of oil right into the ground,'' Mr. Kornfeld said.  ''We had oil coming up into the basement through the sump pump pit.''</p>
        <p>That leak, Mr. Kornfeld said, end up costing about $150,000 to clean up. And while about half that amount was ultimately paid by the oil company -- after costly litigation -- neither that leak nor the leak in the other building was covered by insurance.</p>
        <p>Even more troubling, Mr. Kornfeld said, was the fact that five years after the underground tank in the second building was repaired it sprung a second leak.</p>
        <p>''We did everything we were supposed to do and we still ended up with a problem,'' he said, adding that because by law a tank may be repaired only once, the building ultimately had to decommission it and install a new tank in the basement. The cost was $80,000.</p>
        <p>Debra L. Rothberg, a Manhattan lawyer, said that the potential exposure of a property owner to liability for such problems often extends beyond the building's four walls. For example, she said, if a leak in one building seeps into the ground and migrates into the soil beneath an adjacent building, the liability of the property owner with the leak increases enormously because both properties have to be cleaned up.</p>
        <p>''It's expensive enough cleaning up a spill when you can get to it,'' Ms. Rothberg said,  ''So you can imagine what it would cost to clean up a spill under a high-rise building in the middle of Manhattan.'' In fact, she said, it would not be unusual for cleanup costs in such circumstances to run well into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
        <p>Carla Vel, executive vice president of the Distinguished Programs Insurance Group, an insurance broker in Manhattan, said that one way for boards to protect against such potential problems is to buy a separate insurance policy that covers environmental risks.</p>
        <p>She explained that for about $3,500 a year a co-op or condo board can purchase $2 million in coverage. (Such a policy would have a $1 million per-occurrence limit, a $2 million aggregate limit and a $10,000 deductible.)</p>
        <p>The insurance would provide coverage for liability, cleanup costs and legal defense expenses associated with a claim for sudden or gradual pollution conditions involving leaking fuel oil storage tanks. The insurance also provides liability and legal defense expense coverage for pollution caused by asbestos in the building or lead-based paint. (Remediation costs for asbestos and lead are not covered by the policy.)</p>
        <p>Ethel Zogg, a production underwriter for the Distinguished Programs Insurance Group, said that the company's pollution policy also covers risks less obvious than those posed by lead, asbestos and leaking fuel oil.</p>
        <p>''We're talking about having coverage for things like carbon monoxide poisoning and for hazardous chemicals that might be stored on the property by doctors, dentists and even dry cleaners,'' Ms. Zogg said.  She said that coverage would include liability for injuries sustained by third parties as the result of pollutants or dangerous chemicals present in the building.</p>
        <p>''Third-party liability can be the biggest ticket of all,'' she said, adding that damage awards for injuries caused by environmental pollutants can exceed even pollution cleanup costs.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rothberg, the lawyer, said that while it may be worthwhile for boards to buy additional insurance coverage for environmental claims, the boards should have their lawyer or insurance broker carefully examine the fine print in the policies to determine what is and what is not covered.</p>
        <p>In fact, she said, since premiums for such coverage can cost several thousand dollars a year, a board may be better off investing that money in efforts to eliminate potential environmental problems.</p>
        <p>''In my mind, insurance isn't really the answer,'' she said. ''Making intelligent decisions and facing problems head on make a lot more sense to me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kornfeld, the architect and property manager, agreed. He said that while removing all exposed asbestos in the building might be a costly proposition, it is the only way to eliminate completely the risk posed by the substance.</p>
        <p>And, he said, fuel storage tanks -- whether underground or installed on slabs in the basement -- should be inspected and cleaned every three to five years. ''Sometimes, water gets trapped underneath the oil and corrodes the bottom of the tank,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It is also advisable to mount above-ground tanks on support cradles -- rather than just setting them on concrete -- and to make sure that the exterior of the tank is regularly primed and painted to prevent corrosion. If physically feasible, Mr. Kornfeld said, above-ground tanks in basements should be surrounded by a masonry wall so that any leak will be prevented from spreading.</p>
        <p>Finally, Mr. Kornfeld said, boards that want to know the true condition of their fuel storage tanks can have them pressure-tested -- a procedure in which air is pumped under pressure into a sealed tank. Any drop in pressure is an indication that the tank is leaking.</p>
        <p>The problem with such a test, Mr. Kornfeld said, is that it could cause a leak in a tank that is not leaking. But any leak the test may cause would probably happen later anyway, he said. ''A lot of boards have the philosophy, 'If it isn't broken, don't fix it,' '' he said. ''But it's always less expensive in the long run to avoid problems in the first place or at least catch them in the early stages.''</p>
