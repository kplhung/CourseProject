        <p>OVER the last dozen years, Todd Jacobs has become something of an East End legend. He was the chef at the American Hotel in Sag Harbor for six years before opening his own restaurant, Tierra Mar, in Westhampton.</p>
        <p>This sleek, stylish Mediterranean-style restaurant, nestled beside Montauk Highway, immediately became a magnet for celebrities and a mecca for lovers of good food. Two years ago, Mr. Jacobs doubled his empire with the opening of Atlantica in Westhampton Beach. This beauty, located on the sea side of Dune Road, boasted spectacular water vistas and a gorgeous dining room. Unfortunately, the food was uneven and a bit disappointing for Mr. Jacobs's fans.</p>

        <p>OVER the last dozen years, Todd Jacobs has become something of an East End legend. He was the chef at the American Hotel in Sag Harbor for six years before opening his own restaurant, Tierra Mar, in Westhampton.</p>
        <p>This sleek, stylish Mediterranean-style restaurant, nestled beside Montauk Highway, immediately became a magnet for celebrities and a mecca for lovers of good food. Two years ago, Mr. Jacobs doubled his empire with the opening of Atlantica in Westhampton Beach. This beauty, located on the sea side of Dune Road, boasted spectacular water vistas and a gorgeous dining room. Unfortunately, the food was uneven and a bit disappointing for Mr. Jacobs's fans.</p>
        <p>This season the savvy chef-owner has consolidated his assets into a single restaurant that combines the best of his previous ventures. Tierra Mar has taken up quarters on the beach where Atlantica once was. The elegant dining room is unchanged. A palatial crystal chandelier makes a regal first impression. Second glances reveal masses of hanging lanterns, thick white columns, potted palms and three walls of floor-to-ceiling windows. The sky-high ceiling is draped in blue and white striped fabric, creating a crisp, summer-in-the-Hamptons look.</p>
        <p>There is also a small upstairs room where we were seated one night when the restaurant was host to a wedding. (When we made our reservation, we were dutifully told that the main dining was not available that night.) The upstairs retreat doesn't have the views or the royal splendor of the regular dining room, but it is intimate and cozy. (It is also soundproof and no noise from the wedding could be detected.)</p>
        <p>Service is pleasant and accommodating but could be sharper. A diner who ordered a lobster had to request a cracker and an extra plate to put the refuse. At the end of the meal, no finger bowl nor even a wiping tissue was offered.</p>
        <p>Pricing is wacky. One evening a bland asparagus soup crowned with a gummy steamed vegetable dumpling carried a price of $17. In contrast, a tasty, smooth-as-silk lobster and tomato bisque with chunks of sweet seafood was $9.50.</p>
        <p>This is a menu with appetizers that go as high as $19 and entrees that rise to $40. Still, a one-pound lobster goes for a comparatively reasonable $24. Patrons willing to dine by 7 p.m. get a price break with a special three-course meal for $28. It includes choices from eight appetizers, nine entrees and five desserts; most are straight from the regular menu. By arriving early (when the view is also prime), guests can have a $47 meal, for example, for $28.</p>
        <p>The restaurant's signature dish -- crisp, pan-seared, whole, boneless flounder with fried capers and a fines herbes beurre blanc -- is included on that menu. It's a winner. Also exemplary are the pan-seared sea scallops in a pink grapefruit beurre blanc with slices of delicious oven-roasted salsify. Other top-of-the-line picks are the thick, juicy ostrich tenderloin; the sweet steamed lobster; slices of succulent charbroiled lamb-top sirloin; crisply fried soft-shell crabs mated with creamy jasmine rice, and a chock-full-of-goodies bouillabaisse blessed with a saffron broth, garlic, herbs and tomatoes, all crowned with toasted Tuscan bread. Not up to snuff, though, were the overcooked broiled tuna (gray throughout) and a dry rib-eye steak with mashed potatoes that were stiff and hard.</p>
        <p>The best openers include a beautiful spinach and portobello mushroom salad. It was drizzled with a warm balsamic dressing and featured crisp pancetta and shaved Parmesan. Also creating a stir were three jumbo barbecued shrimp surrounding a chunky guacamole, a cold smoked salmon-asparagus tart and a Tuscan seafood salad loaded with calamari, conch, mussels and shrimp in a red wine vinaigrette.</p>
        <p>Dessert is the best course, and the best of the best is the homemade ice cream. Nothing can beat the devilishly rich double chocolate or the equally decadent strawberry topped with fresh berries. For those not into decadent, the spa fruit plate is the way to go. It is a beautiful composed arrangement of mango, pineapple, raspberries, strawberries and grapes perked up with a lemongrass-citrus spritz. Two other worthies are the way-above-average, silken creme brulee and the banana cream napoleon with warm chocolate sauce and fresh strawberries. But the poached pear was too hard and the cookie assortment uninspired.</p>

        <p>WINE LIST -- A 600-selection wine list was introduced last week, replacing a list of about 35 reasonably diverse choices starting in the mid-$20's.</p>
        <p>PRICE RANGE -- Lunch, entrees $6.50 to $18. Dinner, appetizers $7.50 to $19 (caviar higher); entrees $19 to $40; desserts $4.50 to $8.</p>
