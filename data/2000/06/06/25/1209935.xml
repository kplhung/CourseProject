        <p>Keeneland</p>
        <p>By Alyson Hagy.</p>
        <p>Simon &amp; Schuster, $23.</p>
        <p>When someone in the horse business calls you a ''hand,'' it means you can wrangle any beast without force. Kerry Connelly, a female exercise jockey and the scruffy heroine of Alyson Hagy's first novel, is a hand. Kerry pilots each thoroughbred through its morning workout as if it were her last ride on earth, and the horses respond with fire: ''I felt a quiet hitch, almost like bomber doors were opening beneath me, and boom,'' she says of a hot gallop on a big gelding named Flare. ''I felt lifted a couple of inches, like we were hydroplaning down the stretch on pure energy.'' Anyone who'll regularly take risks like this has got to be a questionable character, and Kerry's capers include stealing money from her own, in-debt-to-the-mob husband, then taking off for the racetrack for which this novel is named. Sometimes Kerry's actions don't make a lot of sense, but Hagy writes about the frantic action around the track with such bold rhythm and timing that Kerry's every blunder turns into a sporting proposition. The inside jokes are nice, too, down to the car Kerry drives: a Citation. More than a legal reference, that's the name of one of racing's pluperfect sires.</p>
