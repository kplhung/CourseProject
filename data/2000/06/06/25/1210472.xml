        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>When I read ''Russell Redux: A Private Man Bursts Back Into the Public Eye'' (June 16), I realized one first has never been mentioned in any of the articles written about Bill Russell. I believe he was the first African-American sports figure to appear in a Fortune 500 advertising campaign. The client was AT&amp;T Long Lines, the business division. Dan Hutchins was the advertising director of AT&amp;T Long lines. The entire AT&amp;T account was then handled by N. W. Ayer advertising.</p>
        <p>It was the dream account for any creative to work on, but for a fairly young African-American copywriter in 1969, it was a miracle. Hutchins reasoned that Russell, because of his successful color commentary on N.B.A. games, could capture two target audiences, women and businessmen. At the time, the only spokesman of color was Bill Cosby, selling Jell-O.</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>When I read ''Russell Redux: A Private Man Bursts Back Into the Public Eye'' (June 16), I realized one first has never been mentioned in any of the articles written about Bill Russell. I believe he was the first African-American sports figure to appear in a Fortune 500 advertising campaign. The client was AT&amp;T Long Lines, the business division. Dan Hutchins was the advertising director of AT&amp;T Long lines. The entire AT&amp;T account was then handled by N. W. Ayer advertising.</p>
        <p>It was the dream account for any creative to work on, but for a fairly young African-American copywriter in 1969, it was a miracle. Hutchins reasoned that Russell, because of his successful color commentary on N.B.A. games, could capture two target audiences, women and businessmen. At the time, the only spokesman of color was Bill Cosby, selling Jell-O.</p>
        <p>I thought creating the Russell campaign would be easy. A basketball has to go from one end to the other and so does a telephone call. He would deliver the commercial and at the end make a trick shot. What I didn't know is that the players have specialties on court and that Russell's wasn't making baskets. He informed me of that at the first commercial shoot. The campaign was called ''You Can't Miss,'' and Bill couldn't miss. Neither did the commercials. They generated a ton of free publicity predicated on the big questions: ''Did he really make those baskets? And if so, how long did it take?'' Jack Anderson, the Washington political reporter, who seldom wrote about advertising, devoted a column to Russell's baskets. Carol Burnett and ''Saturday Night Live'' performed several takeoffs on the commercials in the 70's.</p>
        <p>I soon ran out of basketball tricks. It was easy to come up with a new sport. Russell is a natural athlete. I chose golf. At the commercial shoot, he kept hitting the balls so far it was difficult to track.</p>
        <p>Bill Russell would never tell anyone about this ''first.'' So I thought this would be an opportunity to let today's African-American athletes know there is one other reason to thank Russell for paving the way.</p>
