        <p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey plans to bathe a Holland Tunnel ventilation tower, a 100-foot-tall landmark structure that rises at the end of Pier 34 on the Hudson River, with 62,000 watts of floodlights.</p>

        <p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey plans to bathe a Holland Tunnel ventilation tower, a 100-foot-tall landmark structure that rises at the end of Pier 34 on the Hudson River, with 62,000 watts of floodlights.</p>
        <p>The lights, which will be a permanent installation, will be switched on every night beginning Friday, in plenty of time to welcome Operation Sail, a parade of ships that will enter New York Harbor to commemorate Independence Day.</p>
        <p>Think of the tower as an urban lighthouse that spews car exhaust.</p>
        <p>''It's breathtaking,'' said Ken Philmus, the director of tunnels, bridges and terminals for the authority, who tested the system several weeks ago. ''It won't be lit up like a skyrocket, but will be more muted.''</p>
        <p>The project has the endorsement of the Hudson River Park Trust, the group overseeing the waterfront's renovation. Robert Balachandran, its president, said, ''We are hugely supportive of the lighting plan, which will turn this national historic landmark into a signature element of Hudson River Park.''</p>
        <p>But local officials say the project will tarnish the vistas of the new park. ''It's going to be ugly and out of context,'' said Christine Quinn, the  councilwoman who represents the area. ''The great thing about our waterfront is the natural beauty of the river. An illuminated structure is totally counter to that.''</p>
        <p>Local groups said they learned of the project to light up the brick tower only this month, in a brief letter from the Port Authority.</p>
        <p>''Something like this should go before the community,'' said Arthur Schwartz, a member of Community Board 2 who is also chairman of the advisory council to the river park trust.</p>
        <p>The Holland Tunnel, which opened in 1927, was added to the National Historic Registry in 1993 as the world's first subaqueous tunnel designed for vehicles powered by internal combustion. The designation included the four ventilation towers, two in Manhattan and two in Jersey City, which are capable today of completely changing the air in the tunnel every 90 seconds.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, the Pier 34 tower will be lighted by 42 metal-halide fixtures that emit a white glow, while a supporting structure will receive a yellowish cast from 20 sodium bulbs.  The other ventilation tower on the New York side, near the mouth of the tunnel, will not be lighted.</p>
        <p>But the Port Authority plans to repeat the lighting design on one of the two towers in New Jersey, creating what Mr. Philmus called ''beautiful bookends that will frame the river.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Quinn, who said she planned to petition both states' governors to stop the plan, bristled at the image.</p>
        <p>''Bookends for what?'' she asked. ''The fish?''</p>
