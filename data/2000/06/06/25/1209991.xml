        <p>Interview with the artist Jeff Koons, who says that his 42-foot-high Puppy, now installed at Rockefeller Center, is a symbol of the rights of children and that he is more stimulated by advertising than by the art he sees in galleries; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Q: So many art stars of the 80's disappeared, but your stock seems to be rising. Who expected to see your giant puppy covered with 60,000 flowers in midtown?</p>
        <p>I'm very pleased to see ''Puppy'' at Rockefeller Center. It really feels like the center of the universe. You have NBC located there, so every day during the ''Today'' show, ''Puppy'' is on television. People in Oklahoma or California can see it in bloom.</p>

        <p>Q: So many art stars of the 80's disappeared, but your stock seems to be rising. Who expected to see your giant puppy covered with 60,000 flowers in midtown?</p>
        <p>I'm very pleased to see ''Puppy'' at Rockefeller Center. It really feels like the center of the universe. You have NBC located there, so every day during the ''Today'' show, ''Puppy'' is on television. People in Oklahoma or California can see it in bloom.</p>
        <p>What kind of dog is it?</p>
        <p>A West Highland terrier. If I had done a poodle, it would have seemed very feminine. And if I had done a Doberman or a sheep dog, it would have come off as masculine. But a West Highland terrier seems neutral that way, which is good, because I don't want anyone in the audience to feel alienated. It's a very spiritual piece.</p>
        <p>Since when did you start sounding like a choirboy? About a decade ago you were married to the Italian porn star Cicciolina and making paintings and sculptures that showed you copulating in every which position.</p>
        <p>At that time, I wanted to make a body of work that was romantic in the tradition of Boucher and Fragonard. I don't think I would show those pieces today.</p>
        <p>I'm not surprised. For a while, your divorce and custody battle got more attention than your artwork. Is all that settled?</p>
        <p>My son and I received tremendous injustice from the Italian government. It's not in the interests of my son that he's in the custody of his mother. For the past six years I've gone to Italy every month to visit my son. I hope ''Puppy'' is a symbol of the rights of children. The rights of children are neglected.</p>
        <p>That's quite a switch for an artist who began his career making consumerist fetish objects like floating basketballs and stainless-steel bunnies. Are you trying to distance yourself from the 80's?</p>
        <p>As time goes on, the 80's artists will gain more support. I enjoy Julian Schnabel and David Salle. Andy did great work, too. But visually, I'm more stimulated by advertising than by the art I see in galleries. I like a lot of ice cream advertising. I like a lot of cereal-box advertising.</p>
        <p>Are you saying that a box of Frosted Flakes is more compelling than any of the art in the Manhattan galleries?</p>
        <p>Yes. Visually, it's just more exciting.</p>
        <p>What's your idea of a great cereal box?</p>
        <p>I've always enjoyed Cheerios. But all the breakfast-cereal boxes are exciting. The reason is they're trying to pump energy into people in the morning, make people feel good about the day.</p>
        <p>Are you really this corny, or is it just a kind of Warholish pose?</p>
        <p>I mean it. It's not a mask. So much art is very, very gloomy now. Cereal boxes are just the opposite. Art is obsolete now. New technologies are taking over.</p>
        <p>You don't really believe that art is obsolete.</p>
        <p>I do. There was a time when Picasso was the wealthiest man in France and Henry Moore was the wealthiest person in England, other than the Queen. There's no such thing as that anymore. Bill Gates and your technology leaders are the ones with money. Artists today -- they're nothing within the landscape of economics.</p>
        <p>How, then, have your interests changed?</p>
        <p>I think my interests have remained the same. I'm interested in making objects that you would want to grab and take with you if your house was burning down.</p>
        <p>You're kidding. Why would I want to grab a 42-foot-tall puppy covered with begonias if my house was on fire?</p>
        <p>''Puppy'' is a shelter. It's built out of stainless steel. It's like the fuselage of an airplane. You could live inside it.</p>
        <p>If it had closets. Didn't you begin your career as a commodities broker who made millions of dollars a year?</p>
        <p>I started selling commodities in order to support my art. But all</p>
        <p>I ever thought about was art. When I was at Smith Barney, instead of working I'd be speaking with Richard P. Feynman, the Nobel Prize physicist, asking how I could get the basketball to float in the water.</p>
        <p>I'm glad to hear you're so involved with your art. You've often said that you let your assistants make your art for you.</p>
        <p>I'm looking forward to the day when the flowers on ''Puppy'' can</p>
        <p>be planted without my involvement.</p>
        <p>Do you have a dog yourself?</p>
        <p>I have a bichon frise. They're nonallergenic. They don't shed.</p>
        <p>-- Deborah Solomon</p>
