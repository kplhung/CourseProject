        <p>On weekend mornings, Juan Caicedo doesn't need to get out of bed to meet the brunch crowd. All he has to do is sit up, he said, ''and there are people sitting there, having their coffee, looking at me.''</p>
        <p>Since the weather warmed up, neighbors of a new Starbucks coffee shop at Seventh Avenue and First Street say they have been disturbed by a rear seating area that looks into their backyards and an industrial-strength air-conditioner whose roar keeps them awake at night.</p>
        <p>''The noise is horrendous,'' said Gerry McCleave, a fabric artist who lives a few doors away. She described the sound, which is amplified when it echoes off nearby buildings, as louder than a passing airplane.</p>
        <p>''We can't use our garden at all,'' she said, ''and in my children's rooms, they can hardly study because of the noise.''</p>
        <p>Residents say complaints to the store's manager had no effect, prompting them to call regional and national Starbucks representatives. Two weeks ago, they also called the city's Department of Environmental Protection, which inspected the site and issued a violation.</p>
        <p>Alan Hilowitz, a regional spokesperson for Starbucks, said the corporation did not foresee this problem when the store opened late last year. He said Starbucks planned to remove the offending air-conditioner and put a new one on the roof, but that it would take time.</p>
        <p>''This is not a window air-conditioner,'' he said. ''This is a huge unit. It has to be moved by a crane.'' He said he expected the new unit to be installed by the end of the week, and said the company would put up a eight-foot fence for privacy.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, he said, the store will  turn off its air-conditioner at night.</p>
        <p>Residents said they were skeptical that the the new roof unit would be installed, and added that the situation was an example of how ''commercial gentrification'' could hurt residents of increasingly popular neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>With noise levels the way they are now, ''real estate appraisers have told us that an apartment like ours would come down in value -- rental and sale -- by about 20 percent,'' Mr. Caicedo said.</p>
        <p>Ms. McCleave said that when a neighbor recently tried to sell her house, buyers balked. ''They had a garden, and that's part of the selling price,'' she said. But when the prospective buyers stepped into the backyard, ''They said, 'Hey, what's that drone over there?' They told her that that noise was a definite detriment to them buying the apartment.''</p>
