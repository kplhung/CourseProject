        <p>AMERICAN AIRLINES runs 699 restaurants, and each has dozens of seats with a really superb view, but in all of them, the food is lousy. United boasts that it has removed a row of seats to make coach passengers more comfortable, but its interior decorating is mediocre at best. Continental shows lots of movies, but the selection (not to mention the sound and the picture quality) is much better at the local cineplex.</p>
        <p>How good are the airlines? It depends what you grade them on. Passengers might be forgiven for being confused on this point; after all, they expect to get more than just transportation. An airline customer is different from the customers of most other kinds of companies, being dependent for everything, from a place to sit to pretzels to eat, even air to breathe. Most airlines do not distinguish themselves in any of these categories.</p>
        <p>But as transportation companies, they have a good product that is selling well. The industry will record more than 600 million domestic passenger ''enplanements'' this year, a statistic that counts a single passenger walking onto a plane, whether that is the entire trip or one leg. That number has risen sharply in the last few years, far faster than economic growth or population growth, and will grow further in years to come, as plane trips become more common than ship voyages or intercity train rides ever were, and almost as ordinary as long drives in the car. They move their customers at hundreds of miles an hour, day and night, winter and summer, sometimes late but almost always very safely.</p>
        <p>And as the system grows, size helps. Collectively, the scheduled carriers move nearly two million people a day in the United States, on about 20,000 flights. As the system gets bigger, each flight is more valuable to the public as a whole, because more people can connect to it.</p>
        <p>Still, the perception is that since the federal government deregulated the industry, in 1978, service has declined. Alfred E. Kahn, a professor emeritus of political economy at Cornell University, who was instrumental in deregulation as the last chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board before its demise, says he has heard the argument over and over. It was repeated quite eloquently, he said, in a letter from a business executive who was an acquaintance, complaining about ''an unshaven and unwashed hippie'' sitting next to him on a recent flight. The executive, Mr. Kahn said, preferred the old days, when he sat next to an empty seat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kahn said he answered the letter like this: ''Before responding, I'm waiting to hear from the hippie.''</p>
        <p>''The market is shifting out there,'' Mr. Kahn said in a telephone interview. Often the first complaint people had in the years following deregulation, he said, was that the planes were more crowded, often with people who formerly did not fly. But that, he said, was ''in a genuine sense, a counterpart of the cheap fares we wanted people to have.''</p>
        <p>In fact, in the decade before deregulation, planes on average flew just over half full. In the 1990's they broke into the 70 percent range and some are now above 80 percent full.</p>
        <p>And that is certain to annoy passengers.</p>
        <p>''The airline industry is a victim of its own success,'' said Clifford Winston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in airlines and other transportation issues. With more traffic, he said, ''there is general tension in coach, people fighting for luggage space, and even if the space is there, you've got to climb over someone, and somebody's stuff is there, and you're in the middle row.''</p>
        <p>The good and bad news is that fares are down, he said: ''With lower fares, you find people who couldn't do it before are now on the plane.'' Those who flew when fares were regulated, and higher, remember when planes were empty and airlines competed with amenities like better meals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Winston, in fact, argues that the level of complaints to the government about airline service would be declining, but for the increasing crowding on planes.</p>
        <p>There are other reasons, of course. In fact, the airlines are the companies everybody loves to hate. They charge prices many people find reasonable -- unless the traveler has a specific date and time in mind in the near future. When the airline knows the customer has little or no scheduling flexibility, it is merciless, and with sophisticated computer programs, the airlines always seem to know where demand will appear and they can ration supply, to achieve high prices.</p>
        <p>Another airline innovation, frequent flier miles, also bothers some people. The miles may be the rubles of the American economy -- a currency that is easier to earn than to spend on anything worthwhile, since free seats are seldom available on popular routes at popular times -- but the strategy has helped make the airline industry a success, so other businesses, like hotel and rental car companies, have followed.</p>
        <p>Probably at the top of every traveler's list is safety, a field in which the airlines excel. The Surface Transportation Policy Project, a nonprofit group in Washington that lobbies for help for mass transportation, calculated recently that the fatality rate per billion miles traveled by air carriers was 0.2. Car travel was more than 50 times more dangerous, with 10.5 deaths per billion miles traveled. That means that if you drive 10 miles to take a 300-mile flight, your chance of death is higher in the car than on the plane.</p>
        <p>In fact, air travel is safer than every other mode but one, public city buses, which recorded deaths of 0.1 per billion miles traveled. By comparison, Amtrak was 0.5. Walking was somewhere between 147 to 316.</p>
        <p>Those statistics give context to occasional catastrophes, like the Alaska Airlines crash off Los Angeles in January, or reports of aircraft parts that may not meet the required specifications.</p>
        <p>The airlines are so safe, that you are arguably safer in the air than on the ground. In some years, the biggest cause of death on planes is heart attacks. There are about 60 such deaths a year, but that number will probably fall as the airlines install defibrillators on board. For people at risk of heart attacks, that may make a plane a safer place to sit than their own living rooms.</p>
        <p>They are likely to get safer yet, although not through any public policy. The airlines are heavily regulated, but what drives them hardest in directions that are good for passengers -- in everything from flight safety to defibrillators -- is self-interest, not government regulation.</p>
        <p>Take the defibrillators, for example. On May 20, President Clinton used his Saturday radio address to announce that the Federal Aviation Administration would propose making the defibrillators mandatory on all planes that carry at least one flight attendant. But most major airlines already have them on most of their planes. A defibrillator pays for itself quickly, they have determined, by reducing the number of times a plane must land for a medical emergency.</p>
        <p>In the safety area, the F.A.A. proposes dozens of times a year to require inspection or replacement of a part that has been found to be causing trouble on some airplane somewhere. By the time those orders reach major airlines, they have generally already begun the inspections or replacements, and have often completed them, simply because acting fast reduces the possibility of disrupted operations.</p>
        <p>That does not make them timely, of course. Only about three-quarters of planes arrive within 15 minutes of the scheduled time, and in bad months, about one flight in 40 is canceled altogether. There are a variety of reasons, but chief among them is congestion in the sky. Not much of that can be blamed on the airlines. Part of the problem is on the federal level; even the F.A.A. acknowledges that its air traffic control system is antiquated and inadequate. Part is local; in the last 20 years, only one major new airport has opened in the United States, Denver International.</p>
        <p>David R. Hinson, a former administrator of the F.A.A., has been traveling the country lately arguing that every major airport should be trying to triple its runway capacity, because it takes so long to double the  capacity, even more will be desperately needed by the time that work is done.</p>
        <p>The airlines, in fact, don't like delays any more than passengers do. Their crews fear gridlock, too. A story among pilots, with a ring to it that is apocryphal but telling, deals with an airline nightmare called ''the death spiral.'' A pilot brings his plane in very late, taxis to the gate and finds it occupied by another plane. The other plane is ready to push back, but can't because it is waiting for its crew. And who, asks the pilot waiting on the apron, is supposed to be on the plane at the gate? ''Well,'' says the dispatcher, ''you are.''</p>
