        <p>YOU could call it a boring subject, but it does have some people pretty excited.

        <p>YOU could call it a boring subject, but it does have some people pretty excited. Known as microtunneling or horizontal drilling, it can get from Point A to Point B underground, without digging a long, gaping ditch and disturbing life on the surface. But the technology, which is hardly new, has not been much used in the city, whose streets seem to be cursed with a perpetual plague of traffic-clogging excavations. That could change soon.</p>
        <p>At least one big company, Consolidated Edison, is developing microtunneling techniques for use right here underneath New York City, which is considered hidebound by those in the growing worldwide ''no dig'' movement. Pointing to foreign capitals like London and Tokyo, where trenchless technology was developed, and to American cities like Houston, Boston and Washington, where it has been readily embraced, leaders of the industry say New York still relies on 19th-century technology to solve 21st-century problems. (One possible application is installing the vast fiber-optic network of the future.)</p>
        <p>The situation in New York is particularly acute. Last year, the city issued nearly 92,000 street opening permits.</p>
        <p>No-dig technology, which includes microtunneling (for boring holes up to 36 inches in diameter) and horizontal directional drilling (for holes around 15 inches or less), was developed 20 years ago to install utility lines under densely populated cities. The goal was to create minimal disruption at the surface, while saving time, improving safety and not harming the environment.</p>
        <p>''Excavation is a difficult, disruptive and expensive way to install or repair utility lines beneath New York City,'' said Randy Goffred, manager of Con Edison's research and development department. ''But it's a very interesting problem to deal with.''</p>
        <p>Instead, he said, the company has begun to develop a variety of trenchless technologies, including advance robotics and a brand-new flexible plastic replacement tube, used in repairs, that can actually bend around pipe elbows underground.</p>
        <p>Last year, Con Ed used horizontal drilling to install a 12-inch gas line under the East River from the Bronx to Rikers Island. The company is considering microtunneling to install a new 24-inch steam main from its plant on East 14th Street all the way to customers in the East 40's.</p>
        <p>''Microtunneling would certainly be less disruptive than digging up First or Second  Avenue,'' said Joseph Petta, a spokesman for the company. He said Con Edison was so dedicated to bringing more trenchless projects to New York that it would be host to a major conference on the subject Thursday  at the Con Edison Learning Center, in Long Island City.</p>
        <p>The forum, Urban Application of Trenchless Technology, whose co-sponsors are New York University and Polytechnic University, will explore the indirect and social costs of open excavations and how trenchless technology might reduce them.</p>
        <p>The indirect costs of trench digging include ''reduction in road pavement life, increased street maintenance and damage to local property,'' said Ilan Juran, a professor at the Urban Utility Center at Polytechnic University.</p>
        <p>Social costs, which are difficult to measure, include ''disruption to commercial and private traffic, increased traffic accidents, disruption of community and business access, noise, vibration and pollution,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Professor Juran said there was still no ''broadly acceptable way of accounting for social costs,'' in big excavations. With better ways of doing so in places like New York, he said, ''that would certainly encourage the application of trenchless technologies.''</p>
        <p>Professor Juran is not alone in that assessment. In interviews with several leaders of the American no-dig movement, there was a consensus that the city's political culture resisted trenchless technology.</p>
        <p>''It's a new way of doing things, and New York just hasn't figured it out yet,'' said John Hemphill, spokesman for the North American Society for Trenchless Technology, in Alexandria, Va. He said that red tape, labor unions, construction contractors and decades-old regulations were some of the barriers to the technology to New York.</p>
        <p>''The bureaucracy in New York is totally entrenched,'' said Joseph Vellano, president of Vellano Brothers, a contracting firm in Rochester, with tongue in cheek but making a serious point. ''Those trench guys down there don't want to change things a bit. It's just crazy. No one wants to let go of the past.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vellano said microtunneling could solve a lot of problems caused by excavations in congested areas. ''New York is filled with potholes and traffic jams, and vehicles get torn to pieces on those roads,'' he said. ''A lot of that is caused by digging up the streets.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vellano said members of the no-dig industry were encouraging public and private works in the city to use more trenchless technology. ''Overseas, it was the automobile associations who finally got fed up with chewed-up tires and spending hours in traffic jams, and they put the pressure on.'' He said the English were considering a law that would charge a ''lane rental fee'' for anyone excavating a roadway.</p>
        <p>New York, Mr. Vellano said, is ripe for the technology. ''And not just those big sexy projects,'' he said. ''It should be put to use on an everyday basis.''</p>
        <p>Slowly, the city is coming around. But there is a long way to go before microtunneling becomes commonplace. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, whose first such project in the city was boring under a runway at Kennedy International Airport 15 years ago, will soon use microtunneling in another airport project. A new drainage line will be built under 3,000 feet of highway and parking lot to connect Kennedy  to the main sewer line in Queens, ''without any disruption in traffic at all,'' said Ray Sanford, a Port Authority engineer.</p>
        <p>THE city's Department of Design and Construction conducts one or two microtunneling works a year, according to a department spokesman, Matthew Monahan. Most of those projects have been for the Department of Environmental Protection, and include recent projects like the installation of sanitary sewers in environmentally threatened areas on Staten Island and putting a storm sewer and a water main under the Belt Parkway in Queens, a project known informally as ''digging below the belt.''</p>
        <p>Charles Sturcken, spokesman for the Environmental Protection Department, said the direct costs of microtunneling were double those of trench digging. But, he added, ''We will be thinking about using it where it's appropriate, or if it can avoid traffic problems.''</p>
        <p>Still, people like Mr. Vellano, who admittedly has a financial interest in promoting trenchless technology, remain skeptical about New York City. ''A lot will have to change there,'' he said, ''before they dig only as a last-ditch effort.''</p>
