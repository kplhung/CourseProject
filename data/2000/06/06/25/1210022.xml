        <p>The Travel section receives hundreds of letters from readers about their experiences with airline travel. Although most write to complain, a small number actually offer words of praise. Here is a selection from the last year:</p>
        <p>To the Editor: My connecting United Airlines flight from Chicago to Burlington, Vt., last July was delayed for half an hour because of a ''missing cargo door piece.'' The delay overlapped a storm, which further delayed us for nearly four hours. The flight attendants then informed us that there was a shortage of food, so nine passengers did not even receive pretzels or peanuts.</p>

        <p>To the Editor: My connecting United Airlines flight from Chicago to Burlington, Vt., last July was delayed for half an hour because of a ''missing cargo door piece.'' The delay overlapped a storm, which further delayed us for nearly four hours. The flight attendants then informed us that there was a shortage of food, so nine passengers did not even receive pretzels or peanuts.</p>
        <p>We started sharing food and I dug up peanuts from a Southwest Airlines flight (since they give every passenger two bags). It was like the scene from ''Road Warrior'' where Mel Gibson was opening up dog food for survival.</p>
        <p>MELINDA WHITE  Long Beach, Calif.</p>
        <p>(Ms. White later received a $100 voucher for future travel and a letter of apology from United.)</p>
        <p>Chris Nardella, a United spokeswoman, replies: As is the case each and every day, the safety of our customers is always our top priority. As a result of situations such as Ms. White's, we have equipped all of our aircraft with extended delay kits. These kits include 200 Quaker Oatmeal nutrition bars, two bottles of Pedialyte, a beverage for infants, and extra trash bags. The kits were added in December 1999.</p>
