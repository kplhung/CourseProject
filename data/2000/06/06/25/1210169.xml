        <p>Fred Andrews Book Value column reviews The Knowing-Doing Gap, by Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert I Sutton; Pfeffer and Sutton examine the barriers that can prevent a company from turning knowledge into action to solve business problems; find companies may mistake planning for action, or they may employ flawed measures of performance, or they may have too happy an environment that stifles dissent or too hostile an environment that discourages feedback and paralyzes initiative; point out that reading their case studies and advice is not enough -- the knowledge must be put into action (M)</p>

        <p>WHY can't companies get off the dime? Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert I. Sutton have studied the ways of business for decades, and they come away puzzled as to why so many companies fail to act on what they know. Too often, the solution to a business problem is obvious to all, yet the company can't bring itself to seize the nettle.</p>
        <p>In their pragmatic book, ''The Knowing-Doing Gap'' (Harvard Business School Press, $27.50) Professors Pfeffer and Sutton offer the voice of experience about companies that know what to do but just can't.  Some businesses mistake talk for action; they perfect their plans and presentations, yet no one follows up.  And some enterprises are too happy, creating a bliss that no one wants to disturb with dissent.</p>
        <p>Still others get locked in the past, sometimes because their identities are too strong to adapt. A great many businesses are chilled by a climate of fear that discourages feedback and paralyzes initiative. Many, if not most, enterprises rely on faulty yardsticks of performance, favoring financial measures that do not truly capture their businesses. And most companies routinely do business in a way that divides the work force and discourages employees from cooperating with one another.</p>
        <p>Like most business books, ''The Knowing-Doing Gap'' instructs mainly by example, supported here and there by hard data. The book offers judgments, case histories, impressions, surmise. The ''gap'' is the difference between what a company knows and what it does. The reader must take on faith that the gap is indeed pervasive.</p>
        <p>The book does seem a touch dated. It discusses downsizing but not the Internet and the new economy. The argument also lacks the surprise and paradox of the research by Clayton Christensen, the Harvard Business School professor, about adapting to technology. Professor Christensen  found that smart companies often missed out on emerging technologies not because they were lax, but rather because they were obsessed with serving their best customers.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the book's judgments are good, the examples instructive, the advice sensible, the thesis tightly argued. Business readers will find that the shoe fits. Many will agree with one finding in particular: ''There is far more talk than action about using enlightened management techniques.''</p>
        <p>The authors teach organizational behavior at Stanford University, Professor Pfeffer in the business school and Professor Sutton in the engineering school. They are prolific authors of books, papers and case studies.</p>
        <p>True to thesis, they declare up front that reading a book, their book or any other, is never enough -- that one has to know how to act upon it.  Their book concludes on the same note: ''This knowing is insufficient.  Action must occur.'' And the authors never leave a topic without prescribing seven or eight steps that companies can take.</p>
        <p>Their favorite enterprises include the Men's Wearhouse, a clothing chain that puffs up its sales staff as ''wardrobe consultants'' and insists that the employees help one another; SAS Institute, the software company famous for its peerless benefits and working conditions; AES, the global electric power producer, which operates with minimal headquarters staff and expects its units to solve their own problems; and numerous others, from Sears, Roebuck to Intuit, Southwest Airlines, IDEO Product Development, British Petroleum, Barclays Global Investors and even the New Zealand post office.</p>
        <p>As the authors pick apart the failings afflicting other companies, their own theory of the workplace emerges, chapter by chapter. It centers on employee satisfaction and appears to mark employee opinion as the single most important gauge of progress. They admire Intuit, for example, which closely monitors its employees' assessment of whether the enterprise is living up to its values.</p>
        <p>In their ideal workplace, no boss would be vindictive, and the only failure would be a failure to act. People would feel free to take chances and make mistakes, even colossal ones.  Co-workers would cooperate to the utmost, with all their considerable juices focused on the competition.  Anyone who pursued only his own short-term interest would be dismissed.</p>
        <p>The authors argue that even in a knowledge economy, no company can sustain a a competitive edge simply from what it knows. The marketplace in ideas is too efficient; the best business ideas get around too fast. Businesses must succeed with superior execution -- by doing rather than knowing. Famed competitors like Toyota show off their techniques to all comers, yet no one else ever appears to match their performance.</p>
        <p>They also conclude that businesses do not excel at learning. If they did, then all their branches would perform uniformly well, by borrowing the best practices from their sister units. Yet oil companies commonly find one refinery three times as efficient as another. Fast-food chains live with huge differences in their outlets' profitability.</p>
        <p>Some barriers to action are universal. Even the way people handle themselves in daily corporate discourse sets up a bias against action.  When judged by others, one naturally wants to appear smart, and negative people are consistently judged to be the smartest. The authors cite a 1983  Harvard study of reactions to book reviews: ''Only pessimism sounds profound,'' it found. ''Optimism sounds superficial.'' They warn that a company can wind up with a collection of ''clever put-down artists.''</p>
        <p>The authors say that among the unsuccessful companies they studied, they found ''a pervasive atmosphere of fear and distrust.'' People were afraid to make mistakes, hesitant to speak the truth. They learned to keep their heads down and to mind their own business.</p>
        <p>The authors suggest some steps to expel fear and distrust: Praise and promote people who are willing to deliver bad news to the boss. Learn from, even celebrate, mistakes; encourage leaders to talk about their mistakes and the lessons learned.  Give people second (and third) chances. Banish people, especially leaders, who humiliate others. Don't punish people for trying something new.</p>
        <p>Yet exorcising fear can be difficult to accept. Many people believe that a boss is supposed to be demanding.  Shouldn't his or her wrath count for something? Jack Welch of General Electric did not become ''Neutron Jack'' by handing out cupcakes. And the authors acknowledge the strong feelings of Andrew S. Grove, the Intel chairman, that fear -- fear of the competitor, fear of failure -- is essential in fueling a passion for winning in the marketplace.</p>
        <p>AMBITIOUSLY, the authors would root out intramural competition from the office.  Competition, they say, is by its nature divisive, pitting employee against employee and encouraging  individuals to pursue personal gain at the expense of larger, shared goals. So they would eliminate employee recognition awards, as well as public rankings of top performers, contests among departments or individuals, merit raises from a small pool -- anything in which the winners are few and everyone else is pronounced a loser.</p>
        <p>''Doing well is not the same as winning,'' they write. ''Dominating others in a zero-sum contest is just one form of success.'' They believe that people can achieve high goals by working cooperatively. But they acknowledge that it is tough to persuade companies that competition is bad when the people at the top have been winning competitions all their lives.</p>
