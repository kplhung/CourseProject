        <p>STONE is one of the oldest building materials. It is denser and heavier than most others, and for this reason it is generally used for smaller and simpler do-it-yourself projects.</p>
        <p>Stone is characterized by its shape. Ashlar is cut stone. Flagstones are flat stones used for surfacing walls and paths. Cobblestones are rounded stones, and fieldstones are stones found on the ground.</p>
        <p>Laying down a flagstone path does not require any special skills and only a few basic tools are needed, but it is still hard work. You will have to move a lot of soil, carry buckets of sand and lift heavy stones.</p>
        <p>Start by laying out the general outline of the path on the ground with stakes and cord. Since flagstones are irregular in shape, the path does not have to be perfectly straight or even a consistent width.</p>
        <p>When you have the perimeters of the path staked out, you can calculate its area and estimate the amount of material you will need.</p>
        <p>Theoretically, you can lay flagstones directly on the ground (after removing a few inches of topsoil so the stones are level with the surrounding areas), provided the soil has good drainage.</p>
        <p>But it will be easier to level the stones and create better drainage if you construct a sand bed first.</p>
        <p>To calculate the amount of sand needed, multiply the area of the path (in inches) by two inches (the depth of the sand bed). This will give the volume of sand (in cubic inches) that you will need.</p>
        <p>Calculating the amount of stone is more difficult because the stones vary in size and shape.</p>
        <p>Flagstones are generally grouped according to thickness. Thicker flagstones cost more than thinner ones, so you will get more coverage for the money with thinner stones. But stones less than one inch thick break readily and are easily kicked out of place. So it is best to buy stones at least one and a half inches thick.</p>
        <p>You can find building sand, and flagstones at some larger home centers and lumberyards, or look in the Yellow Pages under ''Landscape Equipment and Supplies'' and ''Stone, Natural.''</p>
        <p>Discuss your plans with the dealer to find out the amount of stone needed. He can tell you roughly how many square feet of coverage you will get from a particular type of stone and the cost involved.</p>
        <p>After you have ordered your materials, excavate the path area deep enough to accommodate the average thickness of the stones and two inches of sand. Check to make sure the depth is uniform by laying a 2 by 4 across the path and measuring from the bottom edge of the board to the scooped-out ground with a ruler.</p>
        <p>Next, lay landscape fabric on the ground. Landscape fabric is made of plastic, not cloth.</p>
        <p>The fabric comes in a roll and is spread to create a barrier between the ground and sand bed that will keep weeds from growing up between the stones. If the fabric is too wide, you can trim it with scissors.</p>
        <p>Use a bucket or shovel to dump sand on top of the fabric. Smooth the sand into an even layer about two inches deep, then tamp it down.</p>
        <p>You can make a tamper by nailing a piece of scrap board (about 6 by 6 inches) to the end of a 4 by 4. Hold the 4 by 4 upright and bring it down so the board on the end flattens the sand into a compact layer.</p>
        <p>This technique works well for small areas, but for a large path you may want to rent a power tamper from a tool store.</p>
        <p>When the sand bed is compacted, you can start laying the stones. If you want your path to have neat borders, pick out stones with straight edges and lay them along the edges then fill in the area in between.</p>
        <p>Place each stone on the sand, then wiggle it back and forth to seat it.</p>
        <p>Positioning the stones in a pleasing overall pattern will require considerable trial and error because each stone has a different shape.</p>
        <p>In narrow places you may have to cut large stones to fit, but it is difficult to make precise cuts because flagstone is irregular in composition and thickness.</p>
        <p>The best way to make a cut is by scoring a line on the stone with a cold chisel. Place a metal pipe under the score line, then strike the waste end of the stone with a heavy hammer. Be sure to wear heavy-duty gloves and goggles while doing this.</p>
        <p>Once all the stones are in place, shovel sand over the entire walk and sweep it into the cracks with a broom. Spray the walk with a fine mist from a garden hose to dampen and compact the sand.</p>
