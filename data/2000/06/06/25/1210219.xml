        <p>AN island village. The end of the weekend. An oversubscribed jitney back to civilization. An angry mob encircles and entraps it until the police come. This is not an episode of ''Survivor,'' the CBS reality television series that pits 16 castaways against one another as they vote each other off their island, one per week. Rather, it's another true tale of survival in the Hamptons, where people drive tanklike cars to battle for parking spaces, litigate like tribal warriors and endure monsoons of bad press, and even jail.</p>
        <p>Last Labor Day, a weekender too embarrassed to give her name was leaving Jimmy Buffett's party in Sag Harbor when she was arrested for drunken driving, then locked up in Riverhead. ''They wouldn't even let me get my pashmina shawl out of my car,'' she said. ''So I spent the night in nothing but a little lime green vintage cocktail dress.''</p>
        <p>A true survivor, she was back this Memorial Day weekend to dine out on her tale.</p>
        <p>Sarongs. Desperation. Control freaks. Tiki torches. Competition between South and East. Hipsters in status sneakers. Back-stabbing. Eating obsessions. The occasional black person. The Hamptons and ''Survivor'' have so much in common that it's hard to tell the two contests of wits and wills apart.</p>
        <p>One island has punitive ''island council'' meetings. The other has a local judge administering a verbal spanking and a $2,000 fine to Puffy Combs for giving loud parties. One has exhausting relay races with people competing for buried treasure. The other has back-to-back parties competing for guests and charity dollars. One has immunity idols.  The other has matinee idols. Both are crawling with sand crabs, stylists and cameras, one for network television, the other for a ''Real World''-type Internet series on HamptonsTV.com about a summer share -- recently cited by the town of Southampton. Both have islanders with coveted building skills (contractors are gods in the Hamptons) and clever map readers like Jodi Della Femina, author of ''Jodi's Shortcuts.''</p>
        <p>Most of all, both have high-strung people in a beautiful setting watching each other's every ugly move.</p>
        <p>Along with Donna Karan, Alec Baldwin and Martha Stewart (who braved a recent fire in her Lily Pond Lane home), the photographer Patrick Demarchelier is a survivor who knows how to avoid trouble. He keeps three boats in Three Mile Harbor in East Hampton and rarely goes ashore. ''People like to go to parties, and it is so boring,'' said Mr. Demarchelier, who is French. ''City people don't like the country, but in life, you have to love nature. If you don't understand the tree and the ocean, you are in trouble.''</p>
        <p>You also have to understand migratory traffic patterns. ''I think the answer is to get out there early and then not leave your house all weekend,'' said Rona Jaffe, whose latest novel, ''The Road Taken,'' is being published this month and whose iHamptons.com column takes on issues like firewood-stealing neighbors. Her social endurance is often tested. ''I can't stand being in a home that makes me feel like I'm in a museum,'' she said. ''I went to Jay Chiat's house for a Planned Parenthood benefit, and he had a red rope in front of the bedroom. Did he think I was going to jump up and down on his bed?'' Well, at least Mr. Chiat's guests could use the bathroom.</p>
        <p>''Porta Pottis at fancy benefit events really make me angry,'' added Ms. Jaffe, who once had a toilet handle broken at a dinner party. ''One of my guests was clever enough to tie a piece of gift ribbon to the lever in the tank and leave a sign telling people to pull it. I'd keep him on my island anytime, but the woman who broke the thing without telling me, she'd have to leave for sure.''</p>
        <p>Often, someone does have to go, of course. Last year, in the wake of vociferous carping over his proposed new pier and house renovation, Tommy Mottola fled the Hamptons. This year, Billy Joel sold Jerry Seinfeld his house and retreated to Nassau County. The Baroness Milly de Cabrol won't be back, either. ''We rented a house last July, and there was a construction pit next door so that the noise was worse than Manhattan,'' she said. ''This year I'm going to Tangier, which won't be nearly as dusty.'' Paolo Zampolli, the president of ID Model Management, meanwhile, is giving up the Hamptons on the Fourth of July for Brazil. ''It's easier to go to Brazil,'' said Mr. Zampolli, who got on and off the island last summer by helicopter, ''and it's cheaper.''</p>
        <p>Marvin Hamlisch is gone. Lee Radziwill is, too, at least for the season. Then there's Michael M. Thomas, the Old Hamptons novelist who rages against the New Hamptons in his New York Observer column. He sold his Sag Harbor home and has moved to Dumbo, the area in Brooklyn under the Manhattan Bridge. ''I think life in the Hamptons is poison to writers,'' he said. ''Brooklyn feels more like Sag Harbor than Sag Harbor as it is now.''</p>
        <p>Other casualties? The party-giving Wilzig brothers are selling their Water Mill castle. The 516 area code is gone for good. And Maya's, the St. Bart's restaurant that arrived triumphally in Wainscott last season, was not a survivor, even with children of the rich and famous waiting tables. ''It had high prices, valet parking and too much attitude,'' one wag sniped.</p>
        <p>Week by week, summer by summer, season by season, we watch with cannibalistic glee as alliances are made and broken by tan people circling each other and driven by fierce inner fires of opportunism.</p>
        <p>This year, Courtney Sale Ross has replaced Ira Rennert, builder of a massive and massively reviled Sagaponack house, as the newest problem  member of the Hamptons mogul tribe. ''She wants to build a big institute in the woods,'' said Steven Gaines, the ''Philistines at the Hedgerow'' author and the founder of iHamptons.com. ''We would love to vote her off the island.''</p>
        <p>Extinguish your torch, Ms. Ross. It may be time for you to go.</p>
