        <p>Taking the slogan ''reach out and touch someone'' to a new level, AT&amp;T has waded into the hard-core pornography business.</p>
        <p>In the aftermath of its recent merger with the cable company MediaOne, its broadband unit plans to carry the Hot Network -- an adult pay-per-view movie channel that some other cable companies have deemed too hot to handle.</p>
        <p>With Hot Network programming selections including ''Cheerleader Strippers,'' ''Stacy's Naked Hookers'' and ''Blondage,'' some groups are outraged. For instance, the ultraconservative American Family Association said in a statement, ''The decision by AT&amp;T Corporation to carry a pay-per-view X-rated channel for its cable division is one more reason for consumers to look elsewhere for their long-distance business.''</p>
        <p>But Bill Asher, the president of Hot Network, said viewers were simply getting what they were asking for. ''The reason companies run our channel is because consumers find it more appealing'' than soft-core pornography Mr. Asher said. ''The customers have to want it.''</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T, which has its headquarters in Basking Ridge, employs nearly 24,000 people and this year was ranked as the state's second-largest employer by New Jersey Business magazine. And MediaOne's five million cable subscribers will make AT&amp;T the country's largest cable operator, with about 16 million customers on the systems it owns and operates, the company said. AT&amp;T cable systems are not available in the metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>The merger, valued at about $44 billion, means that ''by year-end, most of our networks will be upgraded, making analog and digital video, high-speed Internet access, cable telephony and interactive television available to more of our customers,'' said Michael Armstrong, the chairman and chief executive of AT&amp;T.</p>
        <p>In carrying the more explicit programming, AT&amp;T seems to be diverging from the policy of some local cable providers. Time Warner, which has been besieged in the past by criticism of the violent tone of some of its rap artists, turns squeamish when it comes to the Hot Network or its steamy equivalents.</p>
        <p>''The explicit content is something we're not comfortable with,'' a Time-Warner spokesman, Mike Luftman, said.</p>
        <p>Another cable operator, Comcast, said it would not offer the channel either. Both Time Warner and Comcast, which each serve parts of northern New Jersey, carry tamer adult programming like the Playboy Channel.</p>
        <p>But appearances can be deceiving. Stations that have been acquired by Comcast do carry the channel in some markets, Ms. Glazer said, though it does not run under the Comcast name.</p>
        <p>One incentive for programming hard-core pornography is the premium fees associated with channels like Hot Network, which can cost viewers $2 or more over other pay-per-view options.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T plans to carry the network exclusively on its digital tier, so the deal would expand Hot Network's reach by only about 2 million homes, from the 26 million homes in which the channel and its sister stations, the Hot Zone, are currently seen, Mr. Asher said.</p>
        <p>Steve Lang, a spokesman for AT&amp;T, said that because viewers needed a set-top box to receive digital programming, the digital option offers consumers the opportunity to use a password to block out the channel or any others considered inappropriate.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Asher, the signals for his channel are heavily scrambled. ''You can't see it unless you decide you want to and then you have to pay for it,'' he said, ''so that keeps children out.''</p>
        <p>In answering critics, Mr. Lang of AT&amp;T said: ''We offer a wide range of programming that appeals to a variety of different consumers. This is about making choices available to consumers.''</p>
        <p>Or as Mr. Asher put it: ''It's a product that an adult chooses to watch. It's regrettable that people are saying adults shouldn't be able to make that decision.''</p>
        <p>For some consumers, however, AT&amp;T has reached too far. ''We've very disappointed that AT&amp;T would be involved in the spread of that type of pornography into our homes,'' said Len Deo, executive director of the New Jersey Family Policy Council, an affiliate of the American Family Association. ''That type of pornography should not be promoted.''</p>
