        <p>AMY RUTH'S  +  (212) 280-8779; 113 West 116th Street, between Lenox and Seventh Avenues; $$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>With its attractive storefront and attentive, friendly service, Amy Ruth's presents Southern food that manages to be up to date without sacrificing time-honored traditions. Many of the dishes are named in honor of local celebrities. So the starters include Veronica Thompson's herbed tomato soup; Leona Bass's old-fashioned chicken noodle soup, and Kandace V. Simmons's grilled chicken with mesclun greens.  Entrees include Norman Nash's tender smoked ham hocks; Sheila Thomas's fried catfish and whiting combo with sweet potato fries; and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson's seafood lasagna. ($25 and Under: 8/25/99)</p>
        <p>BAYOU  +  (212) 426-3800; 308 Lenox Avenue, between 125th and 126th Streets; $$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This handsome new Creole restaurant would do a New Orleans native proud. Its chef, Steve Manning, cooked for 10 years at Clancy's, an exceptional insider's restaurant in New Orleans. The menu is short, but includes standout appetizers like sauteed chicken livers in a rich port wine sauce; shrimp remoulade with mustard and hot pepper and served with deviled eggs; and cornmeal-fried oysters served over sauteed spinach topped with melted Brie. Entrees include shrimp creole with piquant sauce of tomatoes and peppers over rice; grilled filet mignon with creole mustard, demi-glace, fried onion rings and mashed potatoes; and sauteed snapper Alexandria with roasted pecans, vanilla-lemon butter and mashed potatoes. ($25 and Under: 5/31/00)</p>
        <p>CHARLES'S SOUTHERN-STYLE KITCHEN  +  (212) 926-4313; 2837 Frederick Douglass Boulevard, between 151st and 152nd Streets on Eighth Avenue; $; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Magnificent fried chicken and other Southern specialties are being  turned out at this hot spot. All dinners are served with two vegetables and cornbread. Vegetable selections include collard greens; sweet potatoes; black-eyed peas; okra and tomatoes, and yams. Entrees include curried chicken; smothered turkey wings; spaghetti with turkey sausage; beef short ribs; ox tails; salmon cakes; baked bluefish; smothered pork chops; and barbecued pork ribs. Desserts include sweet potato pie; peach cobbler; and banana pudding. ($25 and Under: 5/23/97)</p>
        <p>EMILY'S  +  (212) 996-1212; 1325 Fifth Avenue, between 111th and 112th Streets; $$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>What Emily's lacks in decor it makes up for in warmth. This pleasant restaurant offers a diverse Southern menu, but the meaty, tender baby back ribs are the best dish. Appetizers include fried shrimp and calamari; popcorn shrimp; Louisiana catfish strips, marinated and crispy fried; and wicked buffalo wings. Entrees include grilled marinated boneless breast of chicken with cornbread stuffing; Jamaican jerk chicken; steak and shrimp combination; and a seafood sampler of fried shrimp, catfish strips and calamari with crispy fries. ($25 and Under: 3/10/95)</p>
        <p>MI MEXICO  +  (212) 665-7338; 3151 Broadway, at Tiemann Place; $; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>The pozole at this little taqueria (served Thursdays through Sundays only) is rich and filling, full of pork, onion, cilantro and delicious, springy puffs of white corn. Other dishes include vegetarian flautas, with cheese, grilled peppers, onions and tomato, served with rice and beans, salad and sour cream; a spicy pumpkin sauce with chicken or pork; steak in a spicy sauce; a variety of tacos, like Mexican sausage, beef tongue, and beef tripe, as well as chicken, pork and steak; and shrimp in garlic sauce. ($25 and Under: 6/2/ 99)</p>
        <p>TAQUERIA Y FONDA LA MEXICANA  ++  (212) 531-0383; 968 Amsterdam Avenue, between 107th and 108th Streets; $; no smoking; cash only.</p>
        <p>This is only one of the many Mexican spots that has sprung up in Morningside Heights, as the neighborhood's Mexican population has increased. Taqueria is particularly interesting because of its extensive and unusual menu. Pork chops are served in a spicy, vibrant sauce of tomatillos, cilantro and chilies, and chicken in a smoky sauce of tomatoes and chipotle peppers. Other entrees include beef sauteed with fresh onions, tomatoes and jalapeno peppers; shrimps sauteed with onions, fresh tomatoes and herbs in a chicken stock, lightly spiced; and stuffed peppers with pork, raisins and banana in a cream sauce.
