        <p>AS a child in Montreal, Murray Sperber could walk to any one of three hockey rinks. He played the game, and naturally engaged in his share of fights.</p>

        <p>AS a child in Montreal, Murray Sperber could walk to any one of three hockey rinks. He played the game, and naturally engaged in his share of fights.</p>
        <p>''If you wanted to play, if you wanted to win, you had to fight,'' he said. ''But hockey fights are very ritualistic. It was you and the other guy, and nobody ever jumped in.''</p>
        <p>Not in the way people have in Sperber's more unconventional battle with Bob Knight, an enforcer with a posse.</p>
        <p>''This is different,'' he said. ''This is sanity versus insanity.''</p>
        <p>After 29 years as an English professor at Indiana University, the past three spiced by his role as a rare faculty critic of the volatile basketball coach, 59-year-old Murray Sperber will pack up his family later this week and return to Montreal. After threats to disrupt his fall classes and calls to his home threatened his life, he is terming it a leave of absence, while conceding he may have taught his last class on his beloved Bloomington campus.</p>
        <p>If that is the case, call it what you want, sabbatical or surrender. Sperber prefers to consider himself what Russell Hanson, the dean of arts and sciences, recently declared him -- a living example of what he is preaching.</p>
        <p>''One of Knight's favorite sayings is, 'Last man standing wins,' '' Sperber said recently. ''I reject that. The fight I'm in is the reform of college sports, and that is a long process. If what's happened to me in any way encourages more college faculties to get involved, then, who knows, maybe I'm winning.''</p>
        <p>An old antiwar and civil rights activist while doing graduate work at the University of California-Berkeley, Sperber always understood there were consequences for confronting the establishment.</p>
        <p>''A lot of my 60's activism probably did get channeled into it,'' he said. ''But I have to laugh when these Knight supporters look up my bio, see the Berkeley part of it, and then it's 'Commie this, Pinko that.' The truth is, there were so many people to the left of me. I was a liberal then. I'm a liberal now.''</p>
        <p>Twenty-nine years on the same campus, the liberal never shook hands with the General. They never met. Sperber tried to interview Knight more than a decade ago for his book, ''College Sports Inc.,'' which started him down this road. He never got past the secretary, he said, which made him no different than most faculty members.</p>
        <p>Sperber, in fact, once polled 45 instructors with 10 years or more experience, and discovered that not one had been in the same room with Knight, not counting the basketball arena.</p>
        <p>Had he deigned to break bread with a respected critic on his own faculty, Knight might have actually learned something about Sperber that he could respect. How Sperber and his wife, Aneta, struggled to cope with having to bury a 6-year-old son more than a decade ago. How they adopted two foster children, both girls, now 12 and 10. Knight would have discovered that Sperber played the game, Knight's game. An inch over 6 feet, Sperber went from youth hockey to high school basketball, to intramurals at Purdue and even played some semipro ball while working on his Ph. D. in the south of France.</p>
        <p>Knight, confronted with mounting evidence of his ill-tempered handiwork after the Neil Reed hand-on-throat allegations surfaced, instead chose to discredit Sperber as a critic and an author. On what did he base his evaluations? Bob Hammel, a retired Bloomington sports editor and longtime friend and flatterer, told him so.</p>
        <p>Knight, the tough guy who builds character, has made a career of stomping out dissent, or just avoiding it altogether. Consider how he let Myles Brand cover for him when the university president announced the zero-tolerance policy last month. When he finally did address the news media, Knight hand-picked the participants as if he were choosing the members of his wedding party.</p>
        <p>For what it's worth, Sperber has never been afraid to debate any rational Knight supporter, including university officials. Several weeks ago, he walked into what could have been an ambush, on sports talk radio with Mike Francesa and Chris Russo in New York. Francesa seemed eager to put Sperber on the defensive. To his credit, he conducted a spirited but fair interview. He later agreed that Sperber in no way came across as uninformed or unreasonable.</p>
        <p>Sperber has another book on the subject of big-time college sports due out in September. Of course, he has heard that he is exploiting Knight, as if he knew the Neil Reed story would break. As if he has been calling newspapers after every Knight outburst for 29 years.</p>
        <p>To the best of his recollection, it was not until 1997, when he was first interviewed by anyone outside Bloomington. By this spring, he was on all the national outlets, often identified as ''Murray Sperber, Knight critic.''</p>
        <p>''I said, 'After all my years of teaching, writing, putting off family outings for students and school, I'm going to go to my grave as a Knight critic,' '' he said. ''I have to tell you that was pretty depressing.''</p>
        <p>The truth is, his interest was the increasingly dysfunctional college sports system long before he became, on the subject of Knight, the go-to guy. Even then, just as at Berkeley, Sperber's bent was more liberal than radical. He always credited Knight for ''running a clean program in a corrupt sport.'' He just thought the cons finally outweighed the pros, that someone on the faculty should stand up to say that ''sports should never overshadow the academic functions of a university.''</p>
        <p>For now, Bob Knight stays at Indiana. Murray Sperber goes, a living example of what he preached.</p>
