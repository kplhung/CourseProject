        <p>THIS Dutchess County village is several hundred miles from Amish country in Pennsylvania, but on a recent brilliant day, a young stallion belonging to an Amish farmer was going through his paces at a horse farm here. Bill Broe, a genial man who has worked with horses for most of his 48 years, was training Lego, a 2-year-old black Morgan, to draw a carriage.</p>
        <p>To accustom him to pulling weight, Mr. Broe had affixed a tire rim to a long rope, which was in turn fastened to the horse's harnesses. The rim clattered as it bumped along the ground. ''The Amish have metal wheels on their carriages, and this will get him used to the noise,'' he said, patting the animal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Broe and his wife, Nancy, who is a real estate broker, own a horse and carriage business called A Horse Drawn Affair. From their 1830's farmhouse here, they take people on carriage rides through the rolling countryside for weddings, picnics, foliage and sightseeing tours, and something called ''Pop the Question'' rides, in which a couple go out single and come back engaged. In the winter, their horses pull sleds.</p>
        <p>They also train horses for others, and in the last several years Mr. Broe has trained 15 horses for Amish owners.</p>
        <p>It surprises people, he said, that the Amish don't always work with their own animals: after all, the popular image of the Amish is a romanticized one, of country folk leading idyllic, close-to-nature lives. The truth, however, is that they are busy farmers and entrepreneurs, often with one or two side businesses, with no more time to train their own horses than someone would have to fix their own automobile.</p>
        <p>''Horses are transportation to these Amish,'' Mrs. Broe said. ''For the Amish, horses are like cars are to us. They want them to be road safe for driving.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Broe added: ''Horses naturally know how to run. But training them to pull carriages is a whole other thing. We teach them to do it in a safe, collected, elegant style and fashion. That's where the training comes in.''</p>
        <p>On this day, Mr. Broe was putting Lego through his paces in a training field. One of his own seven horses, a dark brown bay, seemed to be watching from a distance, occasionally whinnying softly. Lego pricked up his ears, then returned to the business at hand.</p>
        <p>The 2-year-old had arrived a month earlier, having been handled daily but not formally socialized, Mr. Broe explained. As with all horses he trains, the first step is vocal work, teaching commands like ''ho'' (stop), ''easy'' (slow down) and ''break'' (change pace to accept additional weight). Then he was put in a harness and led with a 12-foot-long line, to practice simple walking, stopping and turning left and right.</p>
        <p>Next came noise familiarization: a plastic bucket and metal garbage can lids were attached to a line that was attached to his harness, and Lego pulled them. Getting horses used to the accouterments of carriage work is crucial. Because Mr. Broe's horses pull a lot of vehicles holding brides and grooms, for instance, he shows the animals billowing white sheets, which approximate the look and feel of a full-skirted wedding gown.</p>
        <p>After the garbage can lids, he graduated to the tire and rim for weight and noise. Head held high, the horse trotted around the field, seeming fairly comfortable with the 70-pound weight he was pulling, although Mr. Broe said he had not yet ''settled into it completely.''</p>
        <p>The next step would be to introduce him to shalves, the long, slender wooden pieces that the horse stands between, which are hooked to the vehicle. Finally he would learn to pull an actual carriage. ''After the horses go through this process, they'll walk off with that carriage like they've done it their whole lives,'' Mr. Broe said.</p>
        <p>The Broes' own horses have plenty of opportunity to pull a variety of vehicles. In one of their outbuildings, the Broes have 10 carriages and sleds, some restored originals, others reproductions, all handsome and meticulously painted.</p>
        <p>There's an original 1890 Victoria, a black two-seater particularly popular for weddings and television commercials and a reproduction vis-a-vis with a royal blue body and room for four passengers, who face each other in pairs. There is also an all-white princess vis-a-vis, which looks like something out of Cinderella with a gilded family crest for decoration.</p>
        <p>Among the less formal vehicles is an 1880's six-passenger wagonette and an 1830's four-passenger surrey with, yes, a fringe on top. And there is a big, eight-passenger oak wagonette, outfitted for funerals with a space for a casket. Mr. Broe recently drove it during a funeral procession on Staten Island.</p>
        <p>There are also several sleds, which look as if they had been plucked from a Currier &amp; Ives print. When snow covers the ground, Mr. Broe puts bells on his horses, hitches them to the sleds and takes passengers for festive rides.</p>
        <p>Riding a horse-drawn carriage was once the only way to go; for a tiny handful of people, like the Amish, it still is. But for most people it represents a break with the mundane world, a chance to savor the countryside from a new perspective.</p>
        <p>''The horses give you something special,'' Mr. Broe said. ''You're going at a much, much slower pace. If you take a carriage ride over country roads that you've driven a car on every day, you'll still see things you've never seen before.''</p>
