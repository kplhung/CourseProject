        <p>HOWEVER unfashionable it may be to admit it, I like to fly on commuter airlines. I like to feel the water when I swim, I like to taste the food when I eat, and I like to feel as if I'm flying when I fly.</p>
        <p>This is not a knock on the big airlines or their efficiency in transporting billions of passengers or their safety records. But, really, as you pass from the passenger lounge to the ''people eater'' to the plane, and then back again at your destination, can you really say that you have flown? Wasn't it more like being in a series of large rooms? It's just that in one of them they project movies of aerial scenery outside the windows, and once in a while a burly stagehand bounces the room on the director's cue of ''Looks like we're gonna have a little turbulence, here, folks.''</p>

        <p>HOWEVER unfashionable it may be to admit it, I like to fly on commuter airlines. I like to feel the water when I swim, I like to taste the food when I eat, and I like to feel as if I'm flying when I fly.</p>
        <p>This is not a knock on the big airlines or their efficiency in transporting billions of passengers or their safety records. But, really, as you pass from the passenger lounge to the ''people eater'' to the plane, and then back again at your destination, can you really say that you have flown? Wasn't it more like being in a series of large rooms? It's just that in one of them they project movies of aerial scenery outside the windows, and once in a while a burly stagehand bounces the room on the director's cue of ''Looks like we're gonna have a little turbulence, here, folks.''</p>
        <p>Personally, I am delighted when I note on my itinerary the asterisk that leads me to the footnote, ''Operated by Somebody-You-Never-Heard-Of Airlines'' -- notwithstanding the big corporation's logo on the plane or the masthead on the in-flight magazine.</p>
        <p>My expectations are validated when, at some stopover, I am advised that my connecting flight is at D-78. At the very end of the concourse, I take the escalator down, and suddenly it's as if I'm in a different airport. There are no admirals' clubs or sports bars here; the ceilings are low, and there is no music system. In contrast to the gates upstairs, which are city blocks apart, the gates here are all in one big room.</p>
        <p>The boarding announcements override one another, like competing rug merchants shouting out bargains in a bazaar. (I expect them to try to talk me out of my destination:  ''You don't want Duluth, my friend. Evansville is right for you. I could take 30 percent off that fare.'') There are no monitors or electronic signs. Rather, gate agents manually insert cardboard numbers on a display board.</p>
        <p>The only available food here is from vending machines. But the food upstairs is overpriced, underseasoned and hyperfatty -- even if it does come on a lettuce leaf. Eat your Cheez Doodles and drink your Dr Pepper.</p>
        <p>Passengers in the bullpen seats strain to sort out the information about their respective flights. (''Did she say, 'Wichita' or 'Wichita Falls'?'') When we do board, there is little ceremony. There is no separate loading of celebrities into first class (indeed, the concept of first class on a commuter flight would provoke giggles), and the entire process takes only about 10 minutes. Often the gate agent will walk us to the plane. I wonder whether the agent is going to fly the plane, too.</p>
        <p>I love these walks out to the plane. Like kindergarten kids on a field trip, we stay close together as we follow our agent across the Tarmac. And we're actually on the Tarmac. Little tractors and baggage carts zip around us like deerflies as we keep a wary eye out for approaching Airbuses. We can hear the plane engines and the yelling of crew members. We can smell the jet fuel and feel the prop wash. It's a sensory experience that has all but disappeared as the airline industry strives to make air travel as nonthreatening as possible.</p>
        <p>The seating inside the plane is cramped, but at least it makes sense to have 20 cramped seats on a small plane instead of hundreds of them on a 747. And there are no middle seats; in fact, sometimes a seat is both ''aisle'' and ''window.''</p>
        <p>It is true that there is less space for carry-on luggage and that we'll end up checking it.  But, unlike passengers on the big planes, I can see the guys loading it. And they can see me seeing them. Further, when I get to where I'm going, I will just pick up my luggage at planeside and roll through the terminal to the taxi stand, while the people from those big planes stare at the empty, revolving carousel and curse.</p>
        <p>Many of the planes are prop jets, so that I actually can see the engines start and the propellers begin to spin. (I wish they were real propeller engines, though, so that starting them would sound like that climactic moment in ''Casablanca,'' where the plane engine starts with a whining kick.)</p>
        <p>Like their counterparts on the airborne cruise ships, flight attendants on these planes (usually only one) do the little drill about seat belts and emergency exits and seat cushions that are usable as flotation devices, but people actually pay attention here. The attendant then plops into the jump seat and the plane taxis out toward the runway.</p>
        <p>As with the boarding, the taxiing seems more efficient. This plane doesn't need help pushing back from its parking space any more than a cabdriver needs help pulling away from the curb. The pilot just puts down the flag on the meter and we're off for a drive across the concrete.</p>
        <p>A lot of the passengers appear to be regulars -- sales representatives, tech reps and other itinerants who have gotten to know the flight attendants and who kibitz with them. The plane shudders in the backwash of a launching wide-body, then it's our turn, and we are effortlessly airborne.</p>
        <p>THE flight itself is closer to the ground, and we can see the scenery. (I had flown dozens of times into Ronald Reagan National Airport, for example, but not until I flew there by commuter plane was I truly impressed by Washington's memorials, the Pentagon and those bobsledlike turns that planes must take as they approach along the Potomac.)</p>
        <p>Of course that same low altitude means that in bad weather, the pilot can't get us above it. We are simply in it, and we can only endure it. We macho types pretend not to be alarmed as the contents of our soda glass hover above the glass momentarily when we hit an air pocket. ''Hey, at Busch Gardens you'd have to pay 10 bucks for a ride like this,'' we joke (and then resume mumbling prayers). I try to think of it as my Authentic Flying Experience. Real mashed potatoes have lumps; real flying has bumps.</p>
        <p>Soon we sense the impending landing (in our ears -- pressurization sometimes is a scarce commodity), and we return our seat backs to their full upright position (as opposed to the 91-degree position we used for relaxing). We're down quickly, the pilot does that little prop-reversal thing that halts the plane on a dime, and we chug over toward the terminal, where we stop several  yards from the building. I expect the pilot to caution, ''Now, everyone remember where we parked.''</p>
        <p>I wonder whether the pilots, flight attendants and gate agents are happy here in the farm club. Do the pilots dream of setting down a 747 at Narita or Charles de Gaulle or Leonardo da Vinci? Do the flight attendants look enviously toward the big ships that have entire teams to do all of the things that one person does on a commuter flight? Do the gate agents aspire to a life upstairs where one might see the sun and buy $6 pizza slices?</p>
        <p>I surely hope not. I hope they enjoy it as much as I do. Now if they'd only let me sit up front with the pilots.</p>
