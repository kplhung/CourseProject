        <p>Belmont Park was treated to a solo performance of superior strength and speed yesterday when the champion mare Beautiful Pleasure went wire to wire and won the Hempstead Handicap by 7 1/4 lengths.</p>
        <p>Beautiful Pleasure, a 5-year-old granddaughter of Foolish Pleasure, presented a powerful picture of professionalism as she coasted home far in front of her five rivals for her fifth victory in the last six starts. She was crowned champion older filly for her work last year, when she was first or second six times in seven races. And she gave every sign that she would defend her crown successfully this year.</p>

        <p>Belmont Park was treated to a solo performance of superior strength and speed yesterday when the champion mare Beautiful Pleasure went wire to wire and won the Hempstead Handicap by 7 1/4 lengths.</p>
        <p>Beautiful Pleasure, a 5-year-old granddaughter of Foolish Pleasure, presented a powerful picture of professionalism as she coasted home far in front of her five rivals for her fifth victory in the last six starts. She was crowned champion older filly for her work last year, when she was first or second six times in seven races. And she gave every sign that she would defend her crown successfully this year.</p>
        <p>She ran the mile and a sixteenth in a snappy 1:412/5  after flashing the first quarter-mile in 23 seconds, the half-mile in 453/5  seconds and three-quarters in 1:093/5 . And Beautiful Pleasure was carrying 124 pounds, 9 to 13 more than her pursuers. Still, as she swept home, she had more than 7 lengths on Pentatonic, who was a length in front of Roza Robata.</p>
        <p>''She is the best filly in the land,'' said Beautiful Pleasure's jockey, Jorge Chavez. ''Anyone could have ridden her. There was no sense fighting her; she runs the way she wants.''</p>
        <p>The horse's trainer, John T. Ward Jr., noted that ''she just took command from the start,'' and added: ''I was extremely impressed with the strength that she showed at the top of the stretch. We'll be glad to get her to Saratoga. It's always the most prestigious place to win.''</p>
        <p>Roza Robata, who was named in honor of a victim of the Holocaust, ran second to Beautiful Pleasure until the homestretch as the second choice to the odds-on winner. Dale Romans, who trains Roza Robata, put it simply: ''She made an early move to be up close, and that might have cost her second. I was very impressed with the race that Beautiful Pleasure ran.''</p>
        <p>Beautiful Pleasure returned $2.50 for a $2 bet to win, earning $150,000, and pushed her bankroll past $2.2 million. She is owned by John C. Oxley, an oil executive, who told his trainers before the race to ''enjoy it.'' And they did.</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>Two superstars were on the track yesterday morning at Belmont Park to work out. Lemon Drop Kid, winner of the Brooklyn Handicap in his last start and preparing for the Suburban on July 4, breezed five furlongs in 59 seconds. RANDY SCHULHOFER, assistant to his father, SCOTTY, said the Kid was well within himself, and added, ''You've got Behrens in there in the Suburban, and we're looking forward to taking him on.'' . . . Red Bullet, winner of the Preakness, went five furlongs in 591/5  seconds while training for the Dwyer. ''This horse has just got a great temperament,'' his trainer, JOE ORSENO, said. ''He's already proven he's got talent, but I think he's going to be a star.''</p>
