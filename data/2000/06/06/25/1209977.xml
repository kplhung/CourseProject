        <p>Midwood High School has always been a laboratory for intellectual pursuits. As a graduate of the class of 1959, I was challenged constantly. The standards were high; we were expected to meet them.</p>
        <p>This high school is a testament to public education as the great equalizer in a democracy. With talented educators, high standards, a supportive atmosphere and students who are willing to work hard, our public schools work.</p>
