        <p>WE are not even off the runway yet, and already a chubby businessman is shuffling along the aisle in his jammies and socks, a contented smile on his face. It is nearly 7 p.m. in New York in the thorax of a Boeing 747 headed for London, and he is headed for bed in the new British Airways flying dormitory for trans-Atlantic business travelers.</p>
        <p>There are about 70 of us getting ready to tuck in for the night, 20 in the upstairs loft of the 747, the rest of us downstairs behind the first-class compartment. We each have a snug little pod that converts from a seat to a bed. We have been promised warm milk and cookies as we doze off in New York, and hot tea and breakfast when we wake up before arrival in London. It sounds heavenly.</p>
        <p>Beginning with a single volley of flights between Kennedy Airport in New York and  Heathrow near London, but expanding to all of its long-haul routes by the end of this year, British Airways is the first major airline to equip its business-class cabins with reclining chairs that convert into fully flat six-foot beds.</p>
        <p>Although it was not first, Virgin Atlantic also went horizontal last week with flat beds in its Upper Class service, which is a hybrid of first and business classes. The service is currently offered only on selected flights between Dulles near Washington and Heathrow.</p>
        <p>Flat beds have been part of first-class airplane travel for several years, at least on long flights across the oceans. But as airlines step up the competition to entice the lucrative business traveler, the flying bed is certain to become one of the more attractive perks -- at a price that could cause most leisure travelers to lose sleep.</p>
        <p>My bed, for example, costs $2,986.40 for the night. Even so, I'm guaranteed not to get eight hours of sleep, because the flight from New York to London lasts only seven.</p>
        <p>Forget counting sheep; I'm too busy counting dollars.</p>
        <p>With very little planning, for example, an economy-class ticket on this same plane costs $564.40, one way. (With a lot of planning, a round-trip fare of just $352 can be found.) Subtracting the element of travel, then, I'm spending nearly $2,500 extra for the possibility of a restful sleep in what British Airways describes as a ''lounge in the sky.''</p>
        <p>Or, more to the point, my employer is spending the money. Airlines long ago recognized that business travelers rarely spend their own money. As a result, the cost of the ticket is often less important than the cushier amenities like food, wine, entertainment and, now, beds.</p>
        <p>By some lofty standards, my British Airways business-class sleeper seat may actually be a bargain. Sometime in the next couple of years, according to Sir Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Atlantic, Virgin  will ''bring the romance back to flying'' by offering private cabins with double beds and showers on some of its trans-Atlantic crossings. No pricing has been determined, but one can expect fares to be mile-high.</p>
        <p>The beds in first class on this British Airways flight, just a few steps in front of me, go for $4,895.40 (what's with the 40 cents?) one way. The extra $1,909 over business class entitles the elite flier to a cotton sleeper suit, more attentive service, fancier food and wine, more privacy, more space and a bed that is six inches longer than mine.</p>
        <p>It is possible, of course, to sleep in a coach-class seat, just as it is possible to sleep behind the wheel of a car or on a bench in a bus station. The most relaxing thing about sleeping in coach is that you are not wasting your entire vacation budget on what is likely to be a few hours of slumber.</p>
        <p>But just for the sake of argument, let us attempt the justification that business travelers use: A flying bed allows us to arrive in London well rested at 7 a.m., ready for a day of important meetings. Sleep, after all, is the best defense against jet lag.</p>
        <p>British Airways boasts that it enlisted the aid of National Aeronautics and Space Administration scientists in the effort to improve the sleep of its most valued travelers. Among the findings was that people achieve deep, dream-filled sleep only when they are fully reclined 180 degrees -- flat, that is. On a typical business-class seat, in contrast, the maximum angle of repose is about 130 degrees.</p>
        <p>The NASA influence is evident from the moment I wedge myself into my cloth-upholstered seat, 18J of business class, on Flight 174. Although not as claustrophobic as the Mercury space capsule mockup I once entered, it clearly reflects the fact that on an airliner, even one as large as a Boeing 747, every inch is precious.</p>
        <p>Veteran business travelers know this, and as a result they know about such things as seat pitch. Pitch, defined as the distance between a spot on a seat to the same spot on the seat in front, is 73 inches on these sleeper seats -- at least a foot more, British Airways says, than the pitch of its major competitors' business-class seats and nearly two feet greater than average for all business class.</p>
        <p>To fit the maximum number of beds into business class with the minimum loss of privacy, British Airways has arranged the pods in a most peculiar way. There are eight pods in each row, two by the port windows,  four in the middle, and two by the starboard windows. All aisle seats face forward. The rest -- the seats closest to the windows, and the center two rows -- face backward. The pods are staggered slightly so that the feet of one passenger are not directly in the adjoining passenger's face. It is the original S-type love-seat configuration, so that when the seats are in their upright position, passengers in adjoining seats are almost thigh to thigh in opposite directions. The two center pods are the only ones in the traditional side-by-side alignment, except that they both face backward.</p>
        <p>It is in this love-seat fashion that I meet the gentleman in 18G, facing backward, who greets me by offering any kind of software I want for my laptop computer, free, if I will change seats to enable him to travel with his business partner. ''Anything,'' he says. ''Microsoft Office, anything by Adobe, you name it, I've got it.'' And to prove it, he opens a suitcase crammed full of shiny CD-ROMs.</p>
        <p>Declining his offer of bootleg software, I agree to change to an aisle seat opposite.</p>
        <p>It is then that the happy-looking businessman pads down the aisle in his jammies. We are not even aloft, and he has already changed into his nightclothes, no small feat given his generous girth. While the seats have been expanded, the lavatories are still about the size of a phone booth.</p>
        <p>I DID not think to pack pajamas. People in first class get sleeper suits and a duvet and cover, a flight attendant named Omros tells me, but in business class we get a pair of cotton slipper socks, a sleep mask and a faux cashmere blanket, along with a toiletry kit that includes a toothbrush and toothpaste, a razor and assorted lotions.</p>
        <p>I ask Omros if people in first class snore, but this is British Airways, of course, and he is too discreet to answer. Later, another flight attendant confides that snoring is indeed a problem throughout the plane.</p>
        <p>Before going to sleep, I examine my pod. It reminds me of an armchair, with a hard plastic cocoon around my shoulders and waist. Around me, I notice that there is no place to put my junk. There is precious little storage space within easy reach, although there is ample storage overhead (business class allows two carry-ons). A small compartment under my knees can hold business papers, but it is hardly deep enough to hold a teddy bear. A reading light on a flexible stalk snakes out from over my left shoulder. There is a ''cocktail table,'' a fold-down tray just large enough to hold the glass of milk and cookie. Beneath that, a power plug for a laptop computer (but it requires an adapter, which fortunately I had bought in advance).</p>
        <p>A larger tray, for a meal or a laptop computer, is embedded in the right arm of the cocoon. Everyone seems to have trouble extracting the tray. I break a fingernail.</p>
        <p>Under my left elbow is a telephone that doubles as a video game controller. Games are displayed, along with flight information and a selection of movies and television shows, on a small, 8.4-inch video screen that swings out on a swivel arm from the back of my neighbor's cocoon, just to my left. There are 18 channels, including one that shows the plane's current position on a map, and the startling news that it is 70 degrees below zero outside. Built into the cocoon are a pair of Sally Rand-style plastic fans that, when fully raised, afford about as much privacy as Miss Rand's fans did many years ago. That is to say, it is more perceived than real.</p>
        <p>It is a snug affair. I am not a large man -- a little over 70 inches tall -- yet I fill every available inch of my bed and then some. I notice that several passengers who appear to be much taller are sleeping reclined but not supine, including a tall, elegant woman facing me from a center seat. Tall people just won't fit on the bed without bending somewhere.</p>
        <p>Length is not the only problem. The seats are narrow, and the only way my arms will fit inside the hard cocoon is to jam them against my sides.</p>
        <p>I look back at the plump businessman in his pajamas, and he, like many others around me, is sleeping on his side, perhaps because he and they cannot fit otherwise.</p>
        <p>I choose to stay on my back, with my arms folded over my chest, but that makes it impossible to banish thoughts of mummies and coffins -- except that I imagine few people would be climbing over my coffin. And that is the major design flaw of the flying dormitory.</p>
        <p>The beds are 72 inches long. The seat pitch is 73 inches. So, passengers are literally sleeping head to toe. Because there is only one inch between rows, people who are not on the aisle -- that is, half of business-class passengers -- are trapped in their seats when their neighbors travel to dreamland. The only way to get out to the lavatory is to climb awkwardly over the passenger sleeping on the aisle, or to wake the person and ask him or her to drop the footstool that acts as the bottom foot of the bed. In first class, every sleeper seat is on an aisle, which avoids this problem. (Toward the bulkhead I watch one woman in a skirt manage to hurdle the aisle bed several times in the night with perfect composure.)</p>
        <p>Bill Blacker, a businessman from New York City, notes from across the aisle that, conversely, it is equally difficult for the flight crew to serve the inside rows without reaching over the sleeper. He later says he stayed in the fully upright position for the whole trip.</p>
        <p>Adam Schwam, a businessman from Westbury, N.Y., who has a window seat, says he slept for most of the flight, but he complains about the hard headrest, the lack of air-conditioning controls, and the cloth seats. He says he prefers the leather seats of American's business class, and knocks the love-seat arrangement. ''I feel like I'm on one of those old Coney Island rides,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Still, he says, the beds will probably entice more customers to fly business class.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blacker, one seat over, has an epiphany. ''I know what it feels like,'' he says after his night aloft. ''It feels like a dentist's chair.'' Others, pointing out the little metal trays and swivel arms, agree.</p>
        <p>In the end, I do manage to snooze an hour or two and awake not feeling the need to visit a chiropractor. At Heathrow, as part of the renovations that include the business-class sleeper seats, British Airways has also spent millions expanding the business-class arrivals lounge, with showers, a workout room and a free breakfast.</p>
        <p>But alas, my luggage fails to make it onto the plane in New York. I'm told it will catch up to me when the Concorde arrives that evening. (It actually arrives later that morning.) This gives me time to kill, since the check-in time for most hotels in London is 2 p.m.</p>
        <p>Chatting with some of my dormitory comrades in the arrivals lounge, it appears that the bed service is, overall, a popular success. But one experienced trans-Atlantic traveler tells me that he books a London hotel room for the night before, paying a couple of hundred dollars extra to have a room ready for his early morning arrival.</p>
        <p>I do the math in preparation for the next time I cross the ocean, spending my own dollars. Budget an extra day, fly economy, endure the relative discomfort of coach for a few hours, forgo a bit of pampering in the air, and save a couple of thousand dollars. Then, pay a few hundred dollars to guarantee a real bed and a few hours of sleep on arrival, and take myself out for a good meal.</p>
        <p>With the money I save I could even buy a nightshirt at Harrod's.</p>
