        <p>Literal and figurative storm clouds hung over a new 3,500-seat stadium on the campus of St. John's University on Wednesday, where the Queens Kings, a minor league baseball club that will become a Mets farm team next year, played its opening home game.</p>
        <p>The rain held off, and the Kings  rallied to beat the Hudson Valley Renegades, 10-9. But a lawsuit against the stadium still looms.</p>
        <p>The team said 2,407 people attended the game. But about 60 protesters also showed up, picketing near a parking lot for the $6 million stadium, which the city recently built.</p>
        <p>''If the laws are upheld, we expect the Kings will not be allowed to play here,'' said Barry Weinberg, a protester, referring to a lawsuit by two state legislators and four Queens civic groups that asserts the stadium violates zoning codes.</p>
        <p>On June 7, a State Supreme Court justice denied the group's request for a temporary restraining order to block the opening day game. Justice Charles J. Thomas said he would not decide the case until he heard from the city's Board of Standards and Appeals, which is scheduled to rule on the zoning dispute Tuesday.</p>
        <p>But the Kings may have moved to Brooklyn by the time all the legal wrangling is done. The city expects to open a permanent stadium for the Mets Single-A farm team in Coney Island by June 2001.</p>
        <p>Several protesters said they would press on with the lawsuit anyway. Pointing to a row of small brick homes about 150 feet from the outfield fence, Mr. Weinberg said the area was no place for the noise and traffic of professional baseball games. He added that if the lawsuit succeeded, he would like to see the bleachers and light stands torn down and the team evicted in midseason.</p>
        <p>But Rodney James of Queens Village, who went to the game with his  son, was looking forward to a full season of minor league baseball. With the Kings trailing by two runs in the fifth inning, he said he preferred to ignore any dispute over the stadium and focus on the game.</p>
        <p>''If the home team could get a few more runs,'' he said, ''we could win this game.''</p>
