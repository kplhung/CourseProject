        <p>This weekend house in southern Vermont has a haunting presence that belies its diminutive size -- a mere 650 square feet -- but it's not for the faint of heart. It has no electricity and no running water. It doesn't even have an outhouse.</p>
        <p>Which, for the past seven years or so, has been just fine with its owner and architect, Ross Anderson. ''My threshold of discomfort is higher than that of other members of my family,'' he declares cheerfully. ''I wondered, How little can you build and still have some sort of comfort level?''</p>

        <p>This weekend house in southern Vermont has a haunting presence that belies its diminutive size -- a mere 650 square feet -- but it's not for the faint of heart. It has no electricity and no running water. It doesn't even have an outhouse.</p>
        <p>Which, for the past seven years or so, has been just fine with its owner and architect, Ross Anderson. ''My threshold of discomfort is higher than that of other members of my family,'' he declares cheerfully. ''I wondered, How little can you build and still have some sort of comfort level?''</p>
        <p>But however short on the conventional creature comforts, ''the hovel,'' as Anderson calls the cabin he shares with his wife, Nina Santisi, a film producer, and their daughter, Eva, is long on visual poetry. The 63-foot-long, 10-foot-wide, 18-foot-high metal-roofed structure is clad in widely spaced, black-stained slats of pine, Anderson's reverse take on the shadow lines cast by clapboard siding. By day, stripes of sunlight seep into the rooms; by night, the cabin glows like a paper lantern.</p>
        <p>From the outside, the house appears to be just a long, striped shed, the architect's typically quirky version of vernacular building types -- in this case, tobacco barns or covered bridges. The house's interior is divided into three functional zones, which are denoted by the wall material that is layered behind the slats. The most solid zone is a heavily insulated, plywood-walled living-dining-sleeping area, suitable for year-round use. The entry-mudroom, less winterized, has inner walls of translucent fiberglass. And the porch is the most transparent, its interior walls consisting of nothing more than screens.</p>
        <p>Anderson and Santisi bought the property -- all 97 idyllic acres of it -- from Anderson's friend of many years, William Ackerman, founder of Windham Hill Records. Ackerman, who also builds barns with his business partner, Corin Nelsen, explains, ''I was looking for someone who wouldn't subdivide the land.'' No problem there. ''I went up to look at it,'' Anderson recalls, ''and felt like it was some magical place.''</p>
        <p>Anderson built the house over three years, with Ackerman, Nelsen and any other friends ''who I could con into going there for the weekend.'' One of them, John Newman, a New York sculptor, says: ''It's very inventive, not just clever as a rhetorical idea. It's very intelligent and resolved as a physical, practical thing.''</p>
        <p>And speaking of practical things, Anderson, bowing at last to family lobbying, is installing actual plumbing fixtures, although you'll still have to fetch water for the tanks from an old-fashioned hand pump. Additional structures, like a barn, a bathing tower and a sauna bridge over the pond, are either under construction or on the drawing board. But nothing too fancy, mind you. ''Even with the addition of plumbing,'' says Santisi, ''it's still glorified camping.''</p>
        <p>Or, as Carroll Dunham, a New York painter and another longtime friend puts it: ''I don't know any place else where I feel 'away' in such a good way. The ruggedness of the house is misleading, because it's really very sweet. The primitive nature of it has almost a fairy-tale quality.''</p>
