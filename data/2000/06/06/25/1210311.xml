        <p>For a few high-flying months in his first term, Mike Foster might have been the most popular governor in America, riding a brief economic boom and his Harley-Davidson Road King to unheard-of approval ratings in the range of 70 percent to 80 percent.</p>

        <p>For a few high-flying months in his first term, Mike Foster might have been the most popular governor in America, riding a brief economic boom and his Harley-Davidson Road King to unheard-of approval ratings in the range of 70 percent to 80 percent.</p>
        <p>But the good years never seem to last long in Louisiana. Inevitably, they are overtaken by an extreme statewide poverty virtually unparalleled in the nation, along with an addiction to oil revenues that frequently run dry. When this year's state budget could not be balanced without a sales tax increase on food, Mike Foster fell back to earth, hard. And it is unclear whether the economy will allow him to ascend again in the last three years of his second term.</p>
        <p>A poll released on Monday by Southern Media and Opinion Research found that Mr. Foster now has an approval rating of 54.8 percent, which many governors might consider a blessing. But in April, the same poll gave him an approval rating of 69.4 percent, and in March  1999, his approval reached a high of 82 percent. Bernie R. Pinsonat, who conducted the poll, said the governor's popularity has been in a ''free fall'' since the budget crisis developed earlier this year after several years of surpluses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foster, a gruff, wealthy Republican who often spends weekends at his private duck-hunting camp, has never been popular among the state's black residents, particularly after admitting that in 1995 he secretly bought the contributors list of David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan wizard. But he has always had a strong following among rural and suburban white voters, and among  business leaders. Both groups seem to be deserting him now.</p>
        <p>''He was the darling of the business community during his first term,'' said Pete deGravelles, chairman of the Greater Lafayette Chamber of Commerce and a boyhood friend of Mr. Foster. ''But he really shocked us after he was re-elected last year. All of a sudden he was talking about a whole bunch of new business taxes. It was a whole different tone, and a lot of people were disappointed.''</p>
        <p>Even legislators of his own party have criticized how the governor handled what became a surprise fiscal emergency. Gathered in the state's Capitol this week for an unusual special session to complete the budget, several lawmakers said they wished Mr. Foster had better informed the public about the state's  economic condition.</p>
        <p>''Frankly, he isn't exactly the great communicator,'' said state Representative Victor T. Stelly, a Republican from Lake Charles. ''We've had governors like Edwin Edwards and Buddy Roemer who could charm the socks off a billy goat, and he's not the charismatic type.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Foster, who says he has no political ambitions after he is required to leave office in 2004, insisted that he is not concerned about the falloff in popularity. ''That's what happens when you have a budget crisis pop up on you,'' he said in an interview, though he acknowledged that he could have done better in explaining the teetering economy to the public.</p>
        <p>''I guess I've had a difficult time getting that across,'' he said. ''After you have a few good years, people aren't prepared for a downturn, they haven't had that much pain. There's a kind of disconnect there that makes it very difficult to govern.''</p>
        <p>Louisiana is one of the few states that is having trouble balancing its budget in a period of national prosperity, but its economy and civic health have always followed a different course than the rest of the nation, or even the South. It has the second-highest poverty rate of any state (after much-smaller New Mexico), and the gap between its wealthiest and poorest residents is the nation's widest and is growing. This month it was ranked the worst state for children by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a private, charitable organization based in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>And according to census data, Louisiana was the only Southern state where more people moved out than moved in during the 1990's. While 3.6 million Americans moved to the South, Louisiana experienced a net migration loss of 140,000 people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foster, like several of his predecessors, has tried to solve some long-term problems by improving the state's educational system. But he has found that his state does not have enough money to bring teacher salaries into line even with the rest of the South, a region that already trails the national average. The state is one of the most lightly taxed in the country.</p>
        <p>For decades, state government relied on the oil and gas industry as a reliable source of revenue that provided up to 40 percent of the state budget as recently as the 1980's. But with the depletion of the state's energy resources, oil is now supplying less than 10 percent of the budget, and the state is relying on gambling, a high sales tax and a low income tax for most of its revenues.</p>
        <p>After the price of oil dropped precipitously last year, the industry laid off nearly 13,000 people, which quickly rippled through the economy and produced a sharp plunge in state revenues. Loren C. Scott, an economics professor at Louisiana State University, said the governor and the Legislature also engaged in some questionable budgeting practices, such as using one-time revenues from the national tobacco settlement for operating expenses.</p>
        <p>And so this year, faced with a budget deficit of nearly $400 million, the governor and the Legislature raised the state sales tax on food and utilities by a penny to 4 cents on the dollar, cut personal income tax deductions and increased taxes on telephone calls and tobacco. Many Democratic legislators were furious that business lobbyists prevented any new taxes on the oil and gas industry or on casino gambling, and education advocates said the package did little to improve the state's school system.</p>
        <p>At the same time, though, the Legislature sent a proposed constitutional amendment to voters that would lower the state's dependence on the sales tax, while raising the income tax enough to increase teacher salaries. Economists say such a change would finally allow state revenues to grow with the economy, unlike the current system in which more than half of revenues come from sales taxes.</p>
        <p>But considering the mood the voters are in, few people expect the amendment to pass in November. Mr. Foster acknowledges the difficulty he faces in selling the tax package, hoping he still has a reserve of popularity left from which to draw.</p>
        <p>''Of course we're undertaxed, but no one wants to hear that from me,'' he said. ''I'm just going to have to tell people and not worry about the consequences. We're in the worst of all worlds if I have to start worrying about what my popularity is.''</p>
