        <p>Veselka is a respectable Ukrainian diner in the East Village that has been serving blintzes, pierogis and stuffed cabbage since 1954. The talking posters that recently appeared in the restrooms are a more recent and controversial addition to the scene.</p>
        <p>The posters, which were installed this month in more than 100 clubs, lounges and restaurants in Manhattan, and upward of 600 nationally, are the product of a collaboration between the Sci-Fi Channel, on cable, and Zoom Media, a Montreal company that puts advertising posters in public restrooms. The campaign is designed to promote the new Sci-Fi series ''The Invisible Man,'' which began on June 16.</p>
        <p>The posters depict an invisible man seated on a toilet reading a tabloid. They use sensors to detect when a customer enters and then launch into an unexpectedly personal recorded message that includes the words, ''Hi, Invisible Man here.''</p>
        <p>At locations where the posters have already been installed, among them Vinyl, Katz's Deli, Shampu and Swing 46, reviews have been mixed. Some employees and customers found the ads clever or amusing, but there has also been a rash of complaints. At Veselka, one customer walked out of the restroom with an annoyed look on her face and described the ad as ''really stupid.''</p>
        <p>Other customers have expressed their feelings more directly. At Veselka an obscenity was scrawled on the bathroom wall with an arrow pointing to the poster. At the Acme Bar and Grill, a poster was stolen. At Indigo a poster was torn down.</p>
        <p>As a result, at least two establishments, Indigo and Veselka, have removed the ads.</p>
        <p>Max Chalawski, the manager of Veselka, said he thought the ads had set a dangerous precedent. ''The regular bathroom posters you don't have to read,'' he said. ''The TV you can switch the channel. But those ads are impossible to turn off.''</p>
        <p>However, Josh Greenberg, the Sci-Fi Channel's senior vice president of marketing and a primary architect of the campaign, said his intention was to shock.</p>
        <p>''We thought the best place for the ad was the bathroom because it's the place that you least welcome an invasion of your privacy,'' he said. ''Advertising these days is incredibly invasive. No matter where you are, you're a target.''</p>
