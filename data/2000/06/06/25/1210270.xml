        <p>WHEN the State of Texas executed Gary Graham last week for the 1981 murder of a man outside a Houston supermarket, death-penalty opponents pointed a spotlight on Mr. Graham's court-appointed trial lawyer, whom they criticized for failing to mount anything near an adequate defense.  He barely investigated the case, they maintained, and failed to alert the jury to two witnesses who said Mr. Graham was not the killer and to ballistics evidence that could have exonerated his client.</p>
        <p>While poor legal representation rarely leads to the overturning of criminal convictions, a recent Columbia University study found that two out of three death-penalty sentences were reversed on appeal, and of those about 37 percent were the result of incompetent lawyering. The study -- which examined appeals in all capital cases from 1973, when the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty, to 1995 -- said those reversals were due to ''egregiously incompetent defense lawyers who didn't even look for and demonstrably missed important evidence that the defendant was innocent or did not deserve to die.''</p>
        <p>Before Mr. Graham's execution, Attorney General Janet Reno said, ''There are too many people in this country who do not have competent counsel to represent them in capital cases.'' She added, ''Each state should develop a system that can ensure adequate representation.''</p>
        <p>But what happens to criminal trial lawyers who don't mount adequate defenses?</p>
        <p>The answer, according to experts, is rarely anything other than being given more capital cases.</p>
        <p>According to the American Bar Association Center for Professional Responsibility, the guidelines are clear: lawyers in death-penalty cases must present a ''diligent'' and ''competent'' defense, with lawyers who have several years of experience handling capital cases.</p>
        <p>But Larry Fox, a Cornell University law professor and a former chairman of the American Bar Association's Committee on Ethics and Standards, said that such rules are rarely followed and that there is a ''total disconnect between the standards that lawyers are supposed to meet in capital cases and what they are actually allowed to get away with.'' In those rare cases where disciplinary boards find trial lawyers negligent in capital cases, sanctions range from fines to disbarment.</p>
        <p>The Sixth Amendment not only guarantees criminal defendants the right to counsel, but the right to effective counsel. Courts have generally defined effective counsel as a lawyer whose ''material'' legal actions are reasonable and who does not make errors that would have been likely to change the outcome of a trial.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fox said many states, including Texas, do not have written guidelines that outline the amount of experience court-appointed capital-trial lawyers should have, or the efforts that they should make.</p>
        <p>''They often do not present a competent defense, they are often not diligent, they often do not find witnesses or spend the time and effort necessary to find evidence,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem, according to John Howley, a New York appeals lawyer who has helped win reprieves in recent years for three people sentenced to death in Alabama and Virginia, is pay.</p>
        <p>Few defense lawyers want to take capital cases, because they are difficult to prosecute and the defendants are often indigent and unable to pay their bills. This means  judges must make appointments from a small pool of lawyers, many of whom have poor records and cannot find enough work on their own.</p>
        <p>In Alabama, for example, court-appointed lawyers make $20 an hour. In turn, a 1996 study by a group opposed to the death penalty found that the court-appointed lawyers in Alabama spent an average of three hours trying the penalty phase, in which judges and jurors decide between life and death sentences.</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham's lawyer, Ronald G. Mock, spent less than a week investigating his case and presented little evidence that supported Mr. Graham's assertion that he was not guilty. Mr. Mock has contended that he presented an adequate defense in the case of Mr. Graham and the dozen or so other clients of his who have been sentenced to die.</p>
        <p>SOME states, like New York, have attempted to deal with the compensation issue by setting up capital defender agencies that help shoulder the burden in such cases. The more pressing problem, some legal experts said, is that incompetent lawyers are often allowed -- and even encouraged, because they are less troublesome to judges -- to try additional capital cases.</p>
        <p>''Death penalty cases are some of the most difficult cases for a lawyer to bring to trial, but there is no organized way to assure adequate assistance of counsel in Texas and most states,'' Mr. Howley said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox of Cornell said judges and lawyers do not really have to follow the bar association's standards because the Supreme Court ruled in 1984 that there was a high burden of proof in an appeal that centers on inadequate legal representation.</p>
        <p>In most cases, the answer for clients who are misrepresented is to file a civil malpractice suit against their counsel. But that's little consolation for those whose lives are on the line.</p>
