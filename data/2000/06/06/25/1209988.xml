        <p>Sex Sells</p>
        <p>GUINEVERE TURNER (co-screenwriter, actress, ''American Psycho''): People want to see R movies, adults and children alike, and an easy way to get an R rating is to have sex scenes or nudity. We'd be fooling ourselves if we didn't think teenagers wanted to see sex. And in creating the taboo, we create frenzy around it.</p>
        <p>JOHN PAPSIDERA (casting director): There were two distinct moments that I remember when I sat in a crowded movie theater that was just buzzing with anticipation. One was ''The Full Monty'' and the other was ''Basic Instinct,'' which Paul Verhoeven did before ''Showgirls.'' And it felt like the audience was there because they thought, Oooh, isn't this taboo? It was as if somebody suddenly said it's O.K. for you to go see nudity in a film.</p>

        <p>Sex Sells</p>
        <p>GUINEVERE TURNER (co-screenwriter, actress, ''American Psycho''): People want to see R movies, adults and children alike, and an easy way to get an R rating is to have sex scenes or nudity. We'd be fooling ourselves if we didn't think teenagers wanted to see sex. And in creating the taboo, we create frenzy around it.</p>
        <p>JOHN PAPSIDERA (casting director): There were two distinct moments that I remember when I sat in a crowded movie theater that was just buzzing with anticipation. One was ''The Full Monty'' and the other was ''Basic Instinct,'' which Paul Verhoeven did before ''Showgirls.'' And it felt like the audience was there because they thought, Oooh, isn't this taboo? It was as if somebody suddenly said it's O.K. for you to go see nudity in a film.</p>
        <p>MICHAEL CRISTOFER (director, ''Gia,'' screenwriter): In ''Basic Instinct,'' the nudity helped tell us who that character was -- a woman who used her sexuality to manipulate. If it had not been that interesting a character and a story, Sharon Stone could have walked around naked for an hour and 48 minutes and it would not have made her a star.</p>
        <p>MARC NORMAN (co-screenwriter, ''Shakespeare in Love''): When I think of ''Showgirls'' and ''Basic Instinct,'' the distinction is in the excellence of the film. ''Showgirls'' was a turkey, and the nudity meant nothing to the box office. ''Basic Instinct'' was a crackling good story, and on top of that, everybody heard you could see Sharon Stone's ya-ya.</p>
        <p>In ''Shakespeare in Love,'' there's a tease when Shakespeare is unwrapping the binding over Gwyneth Paltrow's chest, and she's about to be naked, then later on you do see her breasts. We could have optically enlarged the shot so that her breasts were out of the frame. There was some discussion that without the nudity it would get a PG, so people could bring younger children, but it never came to a vote. We didn't feel it was worth second-guessing the creative decision for the marketing decision. And the film ended up making $100 million in the U.S.</p>
        <p>PAPSIDERA: Look at what just happened with Jessica Biel. She was in ''Ulee's Gold,'' and she was fabulous, but, you know, very few people saw that film, and ''Seventh Heaven,'' her TV show, is so sweet and syrupy, she really passed under the radar for a lot of years. So she did the cover of Gear magazine semi-naked. It was an attention-getting moment, and it catapulted her career.</p>
        <p>GLENN RIGBERG (manager, Rigberg, Roberts &amp; Rugolo): What's so interesting is when you wander around the agencies and sets in Hollywood right now, there's this special magazine insert called the Maxim 100, which is pictures of scantily clad models and actresses. And I swear to God, it's being used in Hollywood to help cast movies.</p>
        <p>Too Much of a Good Thing?</p>
        <p>MARK GILL (president, Miramax Los Angeles): If you're writing ''Shakespeare in Love'' or ''Good Will Hunting,'' you are trying to reach an audience that is judgmental about emotional delivery and character development. With a Freddie Prinze Jr. movie, even though the girls in the test audience scream when he takes his shirt off, you try not to have them be too sexy for a PG-13, because you won't get the 8- to 12-year-olds. By contrast, Miramax has a spoof of the ''Scream'' movies called ''Scary Movie'' coming out this summer. There's nudity in it that puts it right up against the edge of NC-17. And we need to be, because the whole point is to make a lot of fun of all of those ridiculous ''sexy girl in jeopardy'' stereotypes.</p>
        <p>CRISTOFER: Any studio with any brains knows that movies that come on strong with nudity, like ''Showgirls,'' are threatening to the young male audience -- which is their primary target. It places a huge responsibility on their shoulders to know more about sex than they do.</p>
        <p>JOAN CHEN (director, ''Autumn in New York,'' actress): With ''Autumn in New York,'' there was a scene where Winona Ryder was to appear naked. It would've been her first time. They must have thought it would be a draw, otherwise they wouldn't have asked her to sign this agreement. And she had some concerns, but she trusted that as I'm a female I wouldn't exploit her and would make sure it was beautiful. The scene was shot through glass in more of an abstract than a real way. Still, at test screenings, people voluntarily wrote that they didn't want to see the nudity.</p>
        <p>Men VS. Women</p>
        <p>TURNER: The female body always has been used for entertainment-slash-abuse. I loved how in ''American Psycho'' Mary put a lot of gratuitous shots of Christian Bale's body, these long, lingering shower scenes, completely shot the way women are done in movies. And there were scenes in which he's looking at himself in the mirror while having sex that had to be cut in order to avoid an NC-17 rating. I take personal offense with that, since I'm nude in a three-way with a hooker later in the movie and I get brutally murdered and that was just fine with the censors.</p>
        <p>CRISTOFER: It's part of the sexist nature of our business. We don't expect Al Pacino or Robert De Niro lying across a beach in a pair of Speedos with a cocktail in his hand trying to be seductive. But a great actress we do expect to lie out as naked as possible, and the only reason she should be in a movie is because we want to have sex with her.</p>
        <p>GILL: There was a really fascinating exception to that recently, the Leelee Sobieski film ''Here on Earth,'' which was all about Chris Klein running around, bronzed, with his shirt off. It was the sort of parading that actresses are expected to do routinely.</p>
        <p>PAPSIDERA: That seems to be an emerging trend in teen films. In ''Varsity Blues,'' Scott Caan was naked except for a cowboy hat and boots, whereas one of the female stars, Ali Larter, wore a less-revealing bikini made out of whipped cream.</p>
        <p>CRISTOFER: That's kind of refreshing, even if it means making male nudity humorous and humiliating. And then there are actors like Ewan McGregor where there's hardly a movie where he doesn't show everything.</p>
        <p>When to Get Naked (or Not)</p>
        <p>RIGBERG: In representing actresses, you always have to ask, ''Will you do nudity or are you totally against it?'' and the answer always seems to be, ''Well, in the right circumstance,'' and then I'll name a circumstance, and they'll say, ''Well, no, but maybe for Martin Scorsese.'' You also need to discuss the difference between sexual conduct and nudity, because some actresses won't do a sex scene, but they'll be topless. Even so, when the director who you've been worshiping during the whole making of the movie says: ''I kind of want to do it like this. Do you mind?'' it puts that performer, especially an unknown, on the spot. That's when you get the call -- Do I have to? Do I have to?''</p>
        <p>BILL VELORIC (agent, Stone Manners Talent Agency): I've run into a number of things that were presented as the right situation and totally became the wrong situation. I just advised someone who wasn't willing to do anything other than upper-frontal nudity not to agree to nudity. Consequently, her part got whittled down, and one of the most valuable scenes in the movie was given to someone else.</p>
        <p>RIGBERG: On the other hand, nudity can put an actress back on the map. I represent Tatum O'Neal, and I recently sent her a script based on Linda Lovelace. But would the mother of an 14-year-old, a 12-year-old and a 9-year-old play this porn star where she would have to be nude in it? At first she called me up and said, ''Are you out of your mind?'' And after, she read it and took it seriously and she said, ''Well, I could never let my kids see this, but I'm into it.''</p>
        <p>PAPSIDERA: There is the desire of actresses of a certain age, meaning over the age of 30, not to be perceived as the mother character. They want to be perceived as young and sexy. In the remake of ''The Thomas Crown Affair,'' Rene Russo did a nude scene, and it was good for her in that regard.</p>
