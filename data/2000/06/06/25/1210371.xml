        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>George Vecsey's column, ''Yanks Don't Need Sosa's Price Tag'' (June 14), was so refreshing to read, given the death-watch mentality that envelops the fans and the press. I applaud Vecsey's journalistic courage by simply acknowledging that because of ''the baseball wisdom of George Steinbrenner,'' logic will prevail. Clearly and unequivocally, precedent has been set over the last five years, and that standard of excellence, or that pursuit of it, enables the Yankees under the ownership of Steinbrenner to ''figure it out.''</p>

I applaud Vecsey's journalistic courage by simply acknowledging that because of ''the baseball wisdom of George Steinbrenner,'' logic will prevail.

        <p>Baseball is a marathon. Steinbrenner has learned enough from the Gene Michaelses and the Gabe Pauls to know that by adding a pitcher and a veteran hitter and by maintaining his core without mortgaging the very prospects they have learned to nurture, he will again position the franchise with logic. As Branch Rickey once said: the best trades are the ones we don't make.</p>
