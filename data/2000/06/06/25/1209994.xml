        <p>A DIFFERENT KIND OF WORLD BANK  Need further evidence that the forces transforming life as we know it -- you know, global economic interdependence, the Internet -- really are changing everything? Take artificial insemination. Sperm banking is now global; consumers are no longer limited to the small donor pools at local mom-and-pop sperm banks. The Denmark-based Cryos has recently generated media interest because of its aggressive marketing in the American, European and Australian markets. With an avowed goal of becoming the McDonald's of sperm banking, Cryos delivers sperm packed in dry ice or liquid nitrogen to more than two dozen countries. Consumers in many smaller European countries favor the Cryos product because cultural, regulatory or economic factors render local sperm banks impractical. Denmark is also regulated less strictly than its neighbors: Danish donors, for example, are permitted to sire as many as 25 offspring before mandatory retirement; in England, the maximum number is 10.</p>
        <p>SEMINAL MOMENTS  The first reported instance of donor insemination took place in 1884, when a medical school professor in Philadelphia prevailed upon his best-looking student to donate sperm. The chloroformed patient never even knew what happened; she thought she was being examined yet again to determine the reasons for her inability to conceive. As techniques for freezing and thawing sperm were perfected in the 1950's, the medical establishment solidified its paternalistic role in deciding who got access to artificial insemination. (On the plus side, the involvement of physicians helped remove the stigma of adultery from the procedure, which one court initially declared ''contrary to public policy and good morals.'') The acme of medical hubris was probably reached in the early 1990's, when Dr. Cecil Jacobson, then of northern Virginia, was discovered to have inseminated unwitting patients (as many as 75, according to some claims) with his own sperm. He maintained he had been doing his patients a favor by providing fresh rather than frozen sperm from a smart (if rotund) doctor. The reluctance of doctors and sperm banks to open their doors to all comers eventually sparked the creation of specialized operations. In Oakland, Calif., for example, Rainbow Flag Health Services, a ''known-donor sperm bank,'' specializes in gay and bisexual donors who seek some modest role in the life of their offspring.</p>

        <p>THE GOOD FATHER  When sperm banking first became popular in the 1950's and 1960's, donated semen was often mixed with the husband's to allow for at least the possibility of biological parenthood. The donor was selected to match the looks of the husband, at least in terms of race, hair color and eye color. As recently as 15 years ago, a one-line description of the donor was the industry standard. Now, a dozen-page medical and family history is typical. Today's sperm shoppers want to know more than the cause of the donor's maternal grandfather's death or the shape of his nose. Many of the approximately 100 sperm banks operating in the United States offer catalogs with varying amounts of background information on available donors, and thousands of profiles are available online. The Georgia-based Xytex offers baby pictures of donors, current photographs and 10-minute videotape bios, plus a donor essay about interests and hobbies that includes ''a message to you or your future children.''</p>
        <p>REGULAR OR HIGH OCTANE?  Now that Ivy League eggs fetch as much as $50,000 on the open market, it's no surprise that sperm banks would make similar efforts at product differentiation. The notorious Repository for Germinal Choice of Escondido, Calif., famous for its Nobel Prize-winning donors, closed its doors last year, but Virginia's Fairfax Cryobank has stepped into the breach with its ''Fairfax Doctorate Donors''; since April 1999 the firm has offered, at a third more than the usual charges, sperm from medical, law, Ph.D. and other students and graduates. Cryos offers three grades of sperm, including an ''extra'' version that contains twice the number of highly motile sperm as its ''regular'' brand.</p>
