        <p>IT takes a certain amount of guts for a choreographer, especially a cerebral one, to invite an audience into the choreographic process. But that is exactly what Douglas Dunn did for his new work, ''The Common Good.''</p>
        <p>About a year ago, Mr. Dunn sent a letter to 1,500 people on his mailing list, soliciting advice for the creation of a new piece. Smart, funny and eloquent, just like Mr. Dunn himself, the letter proposed: ''So, would you like to help me make a dance? Write down a specific move, a phrase, a movement idea, an image or thematic idea to work from, or toward. Write what you do and don't like about my modern dancing.''</p>

        <p>IT takes a certain amount of guts for a choreographer, especially a cerebral one, to invite an audience into the choreographic process. But that is exactly what Douglas Dunn did for his new work, ''The Common Good.''</p>
        <p>About a year ago, Mr. Dunn sent a letter to 1,500 people on his mailing list, soliciting advice for the creation of a new piece. Smart, funny and eloquent, just like Mr. Dunn himself, the letter proposed: ''So, would you like to help me make a dance? Write down a specific move, a phrase, a movement idea, an image or thematic idea to work from, or toward. Write what you do and don't like about my modern dancing.''</p>
        <p>He received 30 responses, some containing drawings as well as words, including one submission from his longtime lighting designer, Carol Mullins. ''I sent a description of an amazing movement that my cat makes,'' she said. ''It's a sideways leap, in which he hunches his shoulders and his feet jut out. I saw absolutely nothing like it in the finished dance, but there certainly was a lot of unusual movement in it.''</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Dunn wasn't able to translate every suggestion into his 50-minute invention, it is worlds away from his previous work, which explored pure movement without much regard at all for the audience. After Ms. Mullins watched the first rehearsal of ''The Common Good,'' which features a couple (Mr. Dunn and his wife, Grazia Della-Terza) and four other dancers, she was surprised, to say the least. ''He's a guy who's really keen on making interesting steps and showing good technique, but this one is going to be fun,'' she said. ''It is about more than steps. There's even a hint of romance. Can you imagine?''</p>
        <p>It is true that ''The Common Good,'' which will be presented at Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church from Thursday through Sunday, is a departure, full of humor, popular songs and a chorus of women who, at one point, frolic among a set of cardboard trees, as if they were fairies in a forest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dunn says it was the Bessie, the New York Dance and Performance Award he received in 1998, that made him change his ways. ''The introduction said I'm not trendy, that I just do my work off in the corner,'' he said. ''It was an image of an isolationist artist. That's always been fine with me. At the same time, when I got my Bessie, I burst into tears. I had to look at that. I realized I wanted more than what I was getting in terms of response and approval.''</p>
        <p>''The Common Good'' isn't entirely light, as Mr. Dunn is hardly capable of creating anything too flashy or, God forbid, banal. Musical selections range from Steve Winwood, to whom Mr. Dunn performs an elegant solo that sweeps from one side of the stage to the other in off-kilter abandon, to the Righteous Brothers and, in the buoyant finale, a pairing of Handel and the Buena Vista Social Club.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Dunn, who is 57 and danced with Yvonne Rainer, Merce Cunningham and the collective Grand Union during the 60's and 70's, was awarded the Bessie, it gave him a chance to reflect on his career. ''I could never have done this piece if I hadn't changed over the past few years,'' he said. ''It is fun. I'm a lot less uptight about holding on so tightly to what I made.</p>
        <p>''This process has led me to see an overall structure -- sections have meaning before I even make a step. It's a fill-in-the-blank. That has given me a chance to reflect upon what I'm doing and improve it.''</p>
