        <p>IS THAT A GUN IN YOUR POCKET?</p>
        <p>Women's Experience of Power</p>
        <p>in Hollywood.</p>
        <p>By Rachel Abramowitz.</p>
        <p>Random House, $26.95.</p>
        <p>In 1992 Rachel Abramowitz, a magazine journalist, began a short article on women behind the scenes of the movie business. Eight years and 300 interviews later she completed ''Is That a Gun in Your Pocket?,'' a look at the ascension of legendary producers like Sherry Lansing and Dawn Steel. Abramowitz reports that Lansing, a tall, dark-haired beauty, used her charm on a host of male mentors, causing her to be ''derided as a 'geisha' ''and sparking rumors that she ''slept her way to the top'' of Paramount Studios. Steel, on the other hand, achieved her success as head of Columbia Pictures through the sheer force of her personality, fighting everyone who got in her way. Penny Marshall began as an actress, learning her craft by watching until she was asked to direct by Lawrence Gordon at Fox, primarily because he thought she could handle Whoopi Goldberg on the problematic film ''Jumpin' Jack Flash.'' Although sexual discrimination was rampant in the film industry -- Lansing was once told ''she wouldn't be able to get a man to work for her'' -- there was no female bonding here. Instead, the women executives Abramowitz depicts were a competitive group with an ''every woman for herself attitude.'' One female studio executive says the women ''had their ''eyes on each other instead of on the jobs.'' Some, like the flamboyant William Morris agent Sue Mengers, even went so far as to blame the lack of women in the boardroom on the women themselves. ''They're discriminated against because they're not that good,'' Mengers said in 1975. Unsparing in her portrayal, Abramowitz offers a well-balanced, though overlong, picture of narcissism and drive without the usual Hollywood spin.</p>
