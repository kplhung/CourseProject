        <p>Madlynn Zurawski collapsed into the corner chair near the stage in Coffee Talk, her little coffeehouse in this South Jersey shore town. The morning rush was through and Ms. Zurawski had a few minutes to recharge before the lunch crowd.</p>
        <p>Business is great, but Ms. Zurawski has little time to enjoy that fact. It seems that the economy has also been good for the young people who used to beg for summer jobs at the shore, and the supply of job seekers is scarce.</p>
        <p>The lament stretches from Sandy Hook to Cape May: The usual torrent of young people who want to work hard, earn some cash, party hard and come back for another cycle the next day is dwindling. With a few exceptions, jobs -- even the glamorous job of lifeguard -- are either going wanting or have taken a lot more time and effort to fill.</p>
        <p>Richard Samuelson, owner of Poor Richard's Inn, a Cape May bed and breakfast, spoke of the young people who have traditionally come from Ireland to work at the Jersey Shore. ''The Irish kids used to come here, work very hard and party hard,'' he said. ''Now, I think the economy is good there, so the kids who come here do so mostly to party, not work.'' .</p>
        <p>So, Mr. Samuelson said, it takes more to lure workers. ''I'm willing to pay $10 an hour for chambermaid work, which is mostly changing sheets, but even high school girls reject that,'' he said. ''High school. Ten bucks an hour for clean work. It's a new world.''</p>
        <p>That world includes fewer college students looking for work. Mz. Zurawski said:  ''I have had to hire more local high school kids than ever before. Rentals have gone up in price around here, so I think there are fewer college kids who want to come down and spend that kind of money.''</p>
        <p>Across from Ms. Zurawski sat Jennifer Dailey, who owns People, People, a women's clothing store around the corner from Coffee Talk. Ms. Dailey has always been able to hire knowledgeable employees a little older than the summertime norm.</p>
        <p>''My ideal person, well, now they are tending bar because that's where the money is,'' she said. ''It's tough for me to have to hire high school kids, but that seems to be what I have to do. It's a new reality.''</p>
        <p>Nor was his situation at all unique.</p>
        <p>''It seems -- and I don't want to sound like an old fogy,'' said 48-year-old Bill Gehlhaus, co-owner of Keansburg Amusement Park and Runaway Rapids Waterpark in Monmouth County, ''that work is not on a lot of young people's minds.</p>
        <p>''Maybe some are going to school, but I'm thinking that Mom and Dad have a little more money and are giving them bigger allowances so they don't have to work in the summer,'' Mr. Gehlhaus said.</p>
        <p>''We've never had it like this year,'' he continued. ''We have 175 employees, and we'd really like to have 200. Sometimes, my brother Hank and I have to get out and man the rides, and we own the place. We have good workers, but you don't want them working too many hours early in the summer and burn them out. It's a long summer and you dont want to over-stress them.''</p>
        <p>Down on the Wildwood boardwalk, the Morey Organization has had to be creative with incentives to keep the 1,700 seasonal workers at its three amusement piers and two water parks.</p>
        <p>''We know that kids who come to the shore to work come for social reasons as well,'' said Denise Beckson, the Morey operations manager. ''So we sponsor a soccer team and a volleyball team. We have pizza parties and one after-work party each week. We do scavenger hunts and give prizes, like backpacks, in recognition of good work.</p>
        <p>''It helps, especially since most of the people we hire are 18 to 22,'' she said. ''When you can work outside and later party with 1,700 people your own age, we figure that's a way to attract good workers.''</p>
        <p>Morey uses mostly American college students early in the summer, but by mid-August, when they begin to go back to school, the remainder of the Morey workforce is foreign students on four-month  work visas whom Morey and other employers find through student-worker agencies.  In the past, most of these workers came from Ireland. But Ms. Beckson said this year's crew comes from Jamaica, Belarus, Russia, Poland, Finland, Ireland -- ''really all over.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Beckson said Morey likes these student workers because they have to be motivated to apply for the work visa, and some take English lessons to qualify. ''They can often be better than the American workers,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Frank Russo-Alesi, the borough administrator in Belmar, a middle-class Monmouth County Shore resort town, said he felt he had been lucky, that summer special police and lifeguarding jobs have filled nicely. Jerome  Joyce, the lieutenant of the beach patrol in Avalon, in Cape May County, said he had enough lifeguards but that beach-tag checkers have been at a premium.</p>
        <p>''In the past you had to be 18, but now we have checkers who are 16,'' he said. Mr. Joyce said there were even incentive programs for beach-tag checkers: an extra $1.50 a day if they stay through Labor Day, a $25 bonus for selling extra beach tags. ''It's just hard to get college kids, especially if they have to pay higher rents. They need more money, which we really can't afford.  So we have to use younger girls who come down here with their parents.''</p>
        <p>Down a few miles in Stone Harbor, the main shopping drag of 96th Street is still full of help-wanted signs. Some are creative, like that at the Eagle's Eye clothing store (''Our Customers Make Our Best Employees''), and others seem a little more desperate, like the ''Help Wanted'' crayon-on-cardboard sign in the window of the Stone Harbor Fudge Factory.</p>
        <p>The True Value hardware store in the middle of the shopping strip has restocked its ''Help Wanted'' sign shelf.</p>
        <p>''In fact, we just finally took our own Help Wanted sign out of the window this week ourselves,'' said one True Value manager.  ''It never used to be a problem to hire people to work here for the summer. To be into the first week of summer still hiring, well, there must be a lot of well-off kids out there.''</p>
