        <p>EVERYONE kissed everyone else and the kisses were wonderful to behold. People kissed on lecture platforms, in a hotel lobby, at an art gallery, at receptions.

        <p>All this happened at the Ballets Russes celebration, an extraordinary event that took place here June 1-4. It honored the three great companies with Ballets Russes in their names: Sergei Diaghilev's pioneering Ballets Russes (1909-29) and the successor troupes of Col. W. de Basil (1932-52) and Sergei Denham (1938-62). Their achievements never fail to amaze. By producing works by choreographers like Michel Fokine, Leonide Massine, Vaslav Nijinsky, Bronislava Nijinska and George Balanchine and, later, David Lichine, Frederick Ashton and Agnes de Mille, these cosmopolitan companies of dancers of many nationalities significantly altered our basic concepts of dance aesthetics. By constantly touring the world, they also introduced thousands of people to ballet. The first ballet company I ever saw was Denham's. And I was hooked on dance.</p>

        <p>All this happened at the Ballets Russes celebration, an extraordinary event that took place here June 1-4. It honored the three great companies with Ballets Russes in their names: Sergei Diaghilev's pioneering Ballets Russes (1909-29) and the successor troupes of Col.

By producing works by choreographers like Michel Fokine, Leonide Massine, Vaslav Nijinsky, Bronislava Nijinska and George Balanchine and, later, David Lichine, Frederick Ashton and Agnes de Mille, these cosmopolitan companies of dancers of many nationalities significantly altered our basic concepts of dance aesthetics. By constantly touring the world, they also introduced thousands of people to ballet. The first ballet company I ever saw was Denham's. And I was hooked on dance.</p>
        <p>A Ballets Russes reunion committee had been planning a get-together for almost three years without ever holding one. Fortunately, the committee allied itself with two balletomanes: Douglas Blair Turnbaugh, a New York-based representative of the International Dance Council of Unesco, and Olga Guardia de Smoak, president of the New Orleans International Ballet Conference. And, miraculously, with the help of a band of devoted volunteers, the celebration happened. It attracted students, dance fans and scholars from North and South America, Europe, Australia and Japan, and when dancers of the former Ballets Russes companies assembled onstage, they numbered 65. Many of them also taught and lectured. And all were voluble conversationalists.</p>
        <p>The excitement was evident from the beginning, with people scurrying to check in at the Sheraton Hotel, which, along with the New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts, was the site of most of the events. There were little shrieks of delight that increased in volume later that evening at the opening of an exhibition of Ballets Russes memorabilia at the New Orleans Museum of Art. The euphoria was infectious, and New Orleans residents who attended events became as excited as the dancers.</p>
        <p>That did not surprise Adda Pourmel, a Ballets Russes dancer who has settled here. ''All they need in this town is an excuse for a party -- and the longer the better,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Among the marvelous presences at this party were the elegant Irina Baronova, one of the legendary ''baby ballerinas'' of the 30's (''Oh, how we all resented that name when we got older,'' she recalled), and other ballerinas like Mia Slavenska, Nathalie Krassovska, Tatiana Stepanova, Irina Borowska and Nina Novak. Moscelyne Larkin, an American Indian ballerina from Oklahoma, was there. So was Raven Wilkinson who, when she joined Denham's group in 1956, became the first black dancer to perform with a company that regularly toured America. The celebration also attracted Nini Theilade, a Danish dancer of legendary radiance (she can be seen as the lyrical first fairy in Max Reinhardt's 1935 film version of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''). Unusual at the time, she was a ballet dancer who was also interested in modern dance. Her hair has grayed, but her vitality has not dimmed even though she has just celebrated her 85th birthday.</p>
        <p>The men present included premier danseurs like George Zoritch and Alan Howard, and there was Marc Platt, who went on from the Ballets Russes to a Broadway and Hollywood career, Robert Barnett, who became the director of the Atlanta Ballet, and Robert Lindgren, who founded the dance department at the innovative North Carolina School of the Arts. Of course, no Ballets Russes assembly would be complete without Frederic Franklin, a human perpetual-motion machine who, at 86, keeps busy staging ballets and advising companies everywhere. But he arrived late, for first he had to portray Friar Laurence in American Ballet Theater's ''Romeo and Juliet'' in New York.</p>
        <p>EVERYONE had stories to tell. There was the one about the Texas tour when the dancers' train broke down and they were herded onto a bus with a large hole in its floor, through which they could see the road beneath them as they sped over it. Then there was the time when the train was stuck for three days in a snowstorm in the Canadian Rockies. On one bus tour, when the dancers felt a need to limber up, the driver would stop at any flat field with a wire fence around it. Holding onto the fence, the company would go through its exercises before the eyes of inquisitive cows and startled passing motorists.</p>
        <p>But this was also a serious and aesthetically provocative event. There was a performance at which dancers from 12 companies volunteered their services to perform excerpts from the Ballets Russes repertories. Yet some of these items looked hastily staged. Of greater interest was the intermission, during which backdrops from several Ballets Russes productions were shown onstage. Particularly stunning were Eugene Berman's handsome Italian Renaissance square for Ashton's ''Devil's Holiday,'' Henri Matisse's monumental arches for Massine's ''Rouge et Noir,'' Salvador Dali's desolate bone-strewn landscape for Massine's ''Bacchanal'' and the charming California mining community Raoul Pene Du Bois designed for Mr. Platt's ''Ghost Town.''</p>
        <p>But the truly important events were the panel discussions and lecture demonstrations. Ms. Theilade taught a fascinating modern-dance class for ballet dancers that emphasized bending, stretching and wavelike movements designed to promote freedom and fluidity in the upper body. Ms. Larkin showed how certain fluttering movements Fokine devised in ''Les Sylphides'' gain special vitality if one realizes that he wished dancers to imagine that they were sprites gesturally sending messages abroad on the winds. Tatiana Leskova bubbled as she coached a young dancer in the giddy Frivolity solo from Massine's ''Presages.''</p>
        <p>Dramatic sequences from ''Giselle'' were demonstrated by Ms. Krassovska, in the title role, with Victor Moreno as Albrecht and Miguel Terekhov as Hilarion, all over 70. What could have looked merely odd became a lesson in expressiveness. Thus, in the mad scene, it was fascinating to see Ms. Krassovska's shy Giselle steadily slip from reality into a strange supernatural realm.</p>
        <p>Most thrilling of all was Ms. Baronova's interpretation of the mimed passage in ''The Sleeping Beauty'' in which the Lilac Fairy defies the evil fairy's curse. The ballerina's eloquent hands and fingers made every gesture meaningful.</p>
        <p>So much of what the Ballets Russes companies represented is being lost. Panelist after panelist lamented how today's emphasis upon speedy feet has led to a neglect of nuanced movements for the upper body. And the erosion of repertory is appalling. The Ballets Russes danced major works that are now almost totally forgotten: among them, masterpieces by the unusually versatile and often daring Massine. Although Balanchine's ballets are being carefully preserved, no one drew up plans to save Massine's.</p>
        <p>But, provided one acts now, some may be salvageable. Dancers with sharp memories who know and love them came to New Orleans. Enterprising companies should call upon them now. By preserving the best of the Ballets Russes style and repertory, troupes today can make the celebration continue artistically for years to come.</p>
