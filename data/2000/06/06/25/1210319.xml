        <p>Although there are no pieces hidden from view like the cards of poker or bridge, chess is also a game of deception. The higher the level of play, the more the outcome depends on penetrating to something the opponent has not fathomed.</p>
        <p>In grandmaster competition, the players produce an unspoken dialogue of feint and riposte until one uses superior imagination to exploit the depths of the board situation that his adversary has missed.</p>
        <p>One nice example of keeping the foe in the dark is the game between the grandmasters Etienne Bacrot of France and Michael Adams of England in Round 5 of the Bosna 2000 International Tournament in Sarajevo. Adams's last three moves were a sudden, fatal surprise to Bacrot.</p>
        <p>After 5 . . . Bb7, the position is a hybrid of Queen's Indian and Nimzo-Indian, but it is often classified as Queen's Indian, , since the most usual move order is 3 Nf3 and 4 Nc3.</p>
        <p>Against Zoltan Almasi, Adams played more passively in the FIDE world championship last year. After 9 Nd2, his 9 . . . Nbd7 10 f3 Qe7 11 Qa4 e5 12 e4 O-O 13 Bd3 Qe6 14 O-O Nh5 15 Rfe1 Nf4 produced a draw.</p>
        <p>This time around, he is willing to loosen his position with 9 . . . g5 10 Bg3 Nc6 for active complications.</p>
        <p>Instead of opening the king's wing with 11 h4 Rg8 12 hg hg, Bacrot might well have played 11 f3 to guard his queen bishop against exchange, the long range plan being to attack on the opposite wing with Nb3 and a4, intending an eventual c5. That way the foremost of the doubled c pawns can be used aggressively.</p>
        <p>Bacrot's 14 Qf3 could not well be answered by 14 . . . Nd7 because 15 c5! bc 16 Rb1 Nb6 17 dc dc 18 Bb5 Qd7 19 Ne4 permits no defense against the threat of 20 Nf6. So, Adams played 14 ... Rg6 and suffered doubled pawns after 15 Rg6 fg.</p>
        <p>Bacrot could have tried 16 c5, but after 16 . . . O-O-O 17 cd cd 18 e4 Rf8 19 Qe3 Nh5, the situation is unclear.</p>
        <p>After 16 Bd3 O-O-O, Bacrot had to keep hands off 17 Bg6? because 17 . . . Ne5 wins material.</p>
        <p>And after 17 Qe2 Rh8 18 Bg6, Adams could win his pawn back with 18 . . . Rh1 19 Nf1 Na5 19 f3 Ba6 20 Bd3 Qd7 21 O-O-O Qa4.</p>
        <p>In place of 21 g4?! Bacrot should have consolidated with 21 Kb2. Adams jumped at the chance to thrust 21 . . . d5! threatening 22 . . . Qa3.</p>
        <p>Had Bacrot answered 23 . . . dc by 24 Bc4, Adams could have played 24 . . . Na5 25 Bb5 a6 26 Bd3 e4! 27 fe Ne4 28 Ne4 Be4 with decisive advantage on Bacrot's weak light squares. The immediate threat would have been 29 . . . Bd3 30 Rd3 Qf7 31 Rd2 Nc4.</p>
        <p>Bacrot's 24 Bg6, however, was vulnerable to 24 . . . Nd5! If 25 Qg1, then 25 . . . Rh6 26 Bc2 ed 27 ed Nc3! 28 Nc4 Nd1 29 Qd1 Nb4 wins easily.</p>
        <p>Bacrot tried 25 Bg1, but failed to divert Adams from his smashing 25 . . . ed! 26 ed ( 26 Bh2 dc 27 Ka1 Ne3 28 Qg1 Qg7 29 Bc7 Kc7 30 Qh2 Qe5 31 Qe5 Ne5 32 Nc4 N3c4 is a winning endgame for Adams) Re2!</p>
        <p>Bacrot gave up because he could find no remedy against 27 . . . Nc3!</p>
        <p>For example, 27 Be4 Nc3! 28 Kc3 Qa3 29 Kc2 (or 29 Nb3 Qb4mate) Nb4 30 Kb1 c3 31 Nc4 Qa2 32 Kc1 Rc2 33 Bc2 Qc2mate.</p>
