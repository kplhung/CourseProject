        <p>I found your photograph of the four empty chairs at Little Governor's Camp, Masai Mara, interesting. I have stayed at Little Governor's on each of my trips, the most recent this past April. The only time I saw four empty chairs was when everyone was out on safari, even last April, which is the off-season. As I prepare to return in five weeks for an extended stay, I find it interesting that a friend who is traveling with us is wait-listed for a tent for July and August because the camp is currently overbooked. Yes, Kenya has deteriorated, but so have many other destinations as life becomes more complex and the gap between the haves and have-nots broadens. Perhaps Blaine Harden's long absence left him searching for memories he had of a more simple time.</p>
