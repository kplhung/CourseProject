        <p>LIKE so many young people growing up in besieged neighborhoods, Muhamed Berte grew tired enough to quit. Tired of violence, tired of despair, tired of poverty and cynicism. But his mother, who learned to read and write as an adult, told him that there was no progress without struggle. So Mr. Berte kept at school and work, turning his back on the streets.</p>
        <p>''We had a lot of struggles,'' Mr. Berte said the other day before going to his after-school job as a clerk in the principal's office. ''Like scrapping through the couch to get pennies to get money for bread. When my father left, when I was 9, he didn't leave us anything. We had to go to the Salvation Army for clothes or ask the neighbors for money. My mother kept telling me I had to set an example for my brothers and sisters.''</p>

        <p>LIKE so many young people growing up in besieged neighborhoods, Muhamed Berte grew tired enough to quit. Tired of violence, tired of despair, tired of poverty and cynicism. But his mother, who learned to read and write as an adult, told him that there was no progress without struggle. So Mr. Berte kept at school and work, turning his back on the streets.</p>
        <p>''We had a lot of struggles,'' Mr. Berte said the other day before going to his after-school job as a clerk in the principal's office. ''Like scrapping through the couch to get pennies to get money for bread. When my father left, when I was 9, he didn't leave us anything. We had to go to the Salvation Army for clothes or ask the neighbors for money. My mother kept telling me I had to set an example for my brothers and sisters.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berte, an earnest, sweet-faced 18-year-old, has indeed set an example. Yesterday, he began his journey to a new life with his graduation from Boys and Girls High School in Bedford-Stuyvesant. In the fall he will enter the State University College at Oswego as a business administration major.</p>
        <p>The city is abloom with graduations this time of year. But in some places, the seemingly routine task of getting a high school diploma and going on to college, especially with one's soul intact, represents a stunning victory. Of the 300 Boys and Girls students who were scheduled to graduate yesterday at the Brooklyn Marriott Hotel, many are survivors, said the principal, Frank Mickens.</p>
        <p>That there are 300 seniors out of a total school population of 3,000 students speaks volumes about how many make it to the end.</p>
        <p>The school is surrounded by some of the toughest housing projects in the country and by astounding poverty, as well as scattered pockets of affluence. Under the stern yet loving guidance of Mr. Mickens, the school has won a national reputation for sending students to good schools and good lives against tremendous odds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mickens knows he makes a difference, but he also credits parents, grandparents and community mentors who entice kids to ignore the gangs and hustlers and do something with their lives. Most of the cheerleaders are ordinary people. Some are not educated and some rely on public assistance, working odd jobs off the books.</p>
        <p>They all show enormous courage and tenacity in keeping children out of harm's way. They tutor. They listen. They give money for scholarships and show up at award ceremonies.</p>
        <p>''I'm so excited about his graduation I don't know what to do,'' Mr. Mickens said of Mr. Berte. ''These kids are survivors. They are going on to Columbia, Cornell, Brown, Hampton, the University of Virginia.</p>
        <p>''Going to school and trying to do good is not the accepted thing a lot of the time. For them and their families, it's an achievement.''</p>
        <p>Besides the reality that too many of their peers lose their way, these are students who may be in foster care or taking care of younger siblings, or mentally ill or drug-addicted parents.</p>
        <p>For some, simply getting to classes is a challenge. Mr. Berte was robbed on the way to school when he lived in Crown Heights. Or he found himself in the middle of gang crossfire or menaced by rival gangs, who taunted him about his allegiances. A crack house was on his school route.</p>
        <p>His mother moved him and his four younger brothers and sisters to the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx. It now takes him 90 minutes each way to get to school. He's thankful.</p>
        <p>''My Mom tells us everyday that she wished she had a better life, that she had finished high school and had gotten a job and given us a better life,'' Mr. Berte said. ''I see her cry.''</p>
        <p>''</p>
        <p>One student told the story of a friend who was living with her family in a temporary shelter. She missed the shelter curfew one night. Her enraged father beat her so badly that he left marks and a swollen eye. Because of her appearance, she missed some final examinations and will not graduate with her class. Her friend said she was afraid that if she reported her father, her family would be broken up and her autistic little brother placed in foster care.</p>
        <p>Another survivor is Ayesha Young, who will attend the State University at Stony Brook. She was 5 when her mother died of cancer and 11 when her father died, also of cancer. Her father was in prison for drug dealing.</p>
        <p>Ms. Young, 17, said she knew she wanted a better life than her parents. She grew up with her grandparents in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Her grandmother is very religious, she said. After school, Ms. Young works 36 to 38 hours a week at a bakery.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people I've known in the past, they've gone downhill,'' Ms. Young said. ''So many people you think are going to make it turn to drugs. I want to work for what I have. I guess it's because of what I went through with my family.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes a graduation is not just a graduation. It is at once a tribute and a triumph.</p>
