        <p>THE phone rings and Irwin L. Jacobs, the fabled corporate raider of the 1980's, cannot hide his emotions.</p>
        <p>''Oh my God,'' he says, holding the telephone to his ear. ''Get out of here!'' A long pause. ''Goodness. Yes. Do it.''</p>
        <p>He turns to his visitor. ''I apologize,'' he says. ''There's something important going on.''</p>
        <p>That something is a sharp rise in shares of Conseco, the big but beleaguered insurer, on a news report that Gary C. Wendt, a former General Electric executive, is a leading candidate to head the company. And Mr. Jacobs keeps reaching for his hot line.</p>
        <p>''Again? How many shares have traded?'' He paces. ''Wow! O.K. Bye.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs scheduled this meeting at his 25th floor office in downtown Minneapolis two weeks earlier to talk about his latest passion: a national bass fishing tournament. But he keeps getting interrupted. And he confesses that the talk about him having designs on Conseco might be true. ''There's no question we've had discussions with people,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs grew enormously wealthy two decades ago by acquiring large stakes in troubled companies like Kaiser Steel and Walt Disney and then selling them for big profits. But on this day, he does not tip his hand as to whether he is just interested in seeing his Conseco investment climb in value -- he has been buying  shares over the last few months -- or whether he is plotting a full-fledged takeover of the company.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing definite,'' he says. ''But we are looking at all our options.''</p>
        <p>He bought a few hundred thousand shares several years ago, when Conseco and its acquisition-minded founder, Stephen C. Hilbert, were the hot growth story in the insurance business. Conseco stock started collapsing last year, partly because of sharp declines at the finance unit that was formed by the acquisition of the Green Tree Financial Corporation. More recently, as the market judged that Mr. Hilbert had paid too much for Green Tree, a mobile home lender, Mr. Jacobs did what he has been doing for decades: buying shares in what he considered a temporarily out-of-favor stock.</p>
        <p>Fifteen million shares, in fact. ''I noticed the shorts were selling,'' Mr. Jacobs, 58, recalls. ''They were selling to me. I concluded this thing was a license to steal at $5 a share.''</p>
        <p>The shares fell to as low as $4.50 in mid-May, but soon rebounded to $7 on speculation about Mr. Wendt. They have since retreated to $5.75.</p>
        <p>Some critics, however, say Mr. Jacobs has a penchant for hinting at takeover bids to drive up a stock and then failing to follow through. A few years ago, he moved to get control of MEI Diversified, which owns hair salons and a variety of other businesses -- and then dropped out.</p>
        <p>''If I told you what I thought about Irwin Jacobs, he'd sue me within 24 hours,'' said Marc Kozberg, president of Dougherty Value Advisors here and a former shareholder of MEI Diversified. ''The first question I would ask is whether he has the wherewithal to buy Conseco.''</p>
        <p>Asked to respond, Mr. Jacobs, with more than $50 million by his own account invested in Conseco, hints that he has assembled a ''team'' to arrange a possible takeover. He will not say more.</p>
        <p>He stops talking about Conseco and returns to his other preoccupation: Operation Bass. This meeting, after all, was about bass fishing, not corporate raiding.</p>
        <p>With Genmar Holdings, his boat manufacturing business, in a slump in the early 1990's, Mr. Jacobs commissioned a study and found that ''our fishing customer was there all the time, even in a down market.''</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Why aren't we catering to their passion?' ''</p>
        <p>That is when Mr. Jacobs bought Operation Bass, a 40-employee company based in Gilbertsville, Ky., that is a leader in bass tournament promotions. The deal, if one of his smallest, has been one of his most satisfying in years.</p>
        <p>Initially, Mr. Jacobs -- worth an estimated $400 million -- wanted to find a way to publicize Genmar's fishing boats, including the Ranger and Wellcraft brands. But then he recognized an audience bigger than potential boat owners: the 55 million Americans who go fishing each year.</p>
        <p>''This is the largest group of untapped consumers,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs says people who love fishing tend to be loyal -- and buy billions of dollars' worth of consumer goods. His vision: Why not splash corporate logos on fishing boats, the way Nascar paints its race cars? ''The Nascar demographics are identical,'' he says. ''And no one has marketed to them.''</p>
        <p>He put up some prize money and convinced Wal-Mart Stores to become the lead sponsor of the annual Operation Bass fishing tournament, which was held this weekend in Florence, Ala., and is one of the largest in the world. He corralled Kellogg's, Coca-Cola and Visa as backers, too.</p>
        <p>He also got busy generating publicity. There is a Wheaties box with Denny Brauer, the champion of the 1998 tournament, feted as ''Angler of the Year.'' ABC News did a report on the fishing tournament; ESPN, its sister network, now broadcasts it every year. And did he mention the  research report showing that fishing is more popular than tennis and golf combined?</p>
        <p>A few years ago, Genmar -- a private company that he acquired in the 1970's and transformed into the world's second-largest boat maker -- was on the verge of bankruptcy. Now, says Mr. Jacobs, who remains Genmar's chairman, it is growing at a 30 percent clip, with sales approaching $1 billion.</p>
        <p>And he has fish on his mind, almost all the time.  Off to lunch in a nearby restaurant with Genmar's chief executive and chief financial officer,  Mr. Jacobs says he has come up with a recipe that ''fishing people'' might love -- a fish batter that he says Kellogg has expressed interest in marketing. ''This is pretty good,'' he says, tasting some trout he has arranged to have prepared in the batter. ''What do you guys think?''</p>
        <p>The more provocative question, of course, is this: What's next for this deal maker turned bass-fishing promoter?</p>
        <p>Unpredictability, he says. That is the course he has always taken. ''If you look back at every deal I've done, I haven't tried to be unpredictable; it's just the circumstances that make me do what I do,'' he says. ''I'm just flexible.''</p>
        <p>So if shares of Conseco, based in Carmel, Ind., an Indianapolis suburb, do not begin to climb soon, keep an eye on Mr. Jacobs.</p>
        <p>''Don't expect me to move to Indianapolis,'' he says. ''But I've made serious investments, and I've made one in Conseco. So I would seriously consider doing something about that.''</p>
