      <abstract>
        <p>Florida appeals court rules in divorce case, Witowski v Witowski, that contributions to husband's pension during the marriage are marital property, and the wife is entitled to a share; court finds prenuptial agreement that listed pension as husband's property applies only to what he owned before the marriage (M)</p>

        <p>Many couples visit lawyers for a prenuptial agreement before the trip to the altar, but even that foresight does not mean a divorce will not be contentious. A new Web site about divorce issues, www.split-up.com, sees an example of the problem in a recent court case.</p>
        <p>The case, Witowski v. Witowski, was decided on May 5 in the District Court of Appeal of Florida. The court found that although the prenuptial agreement listed the husband's pension as his property, only what he owned before the marriage and the appreciation on that part were his alone. What he and his employer contributed during the marriage and the appreciation on those contributions were marital property, the court ruled, and the wife was entitled to a share.</p>

        <p>Many couples visit lawyers for a prenuptial agreement before the trip to the altar, but even that foresight does not mean a divorce will not be contentious. A new Web site about divorce issues, www.split-up.com, sees an example of the problem in a recent court case.</p>
        <p>The case, Witowski v. Witowski, was decided on May 5 in the District Court of Appeal of Florida. The court found that although the prenuptial agreement listed the husband's pension as his property, only what he owned before the marriage and the appreciation on that part were his alone. What he and his employer contributed during the marriage and the appreciation on those contributions were marital property, the court ruled, and the wife was entitled to a share.</p>
        <p>The lesson of the case, Split-Up commented, is that a prenuptial agreement should be very clear on issues involving a pension, a business or any other asset that is created before the marriage and is contributed to during the marriage.</p>
        <p>Split-Up.com was founded by Daniel Caine and Wendell Smith, also the creators of Kiplinger's TaxCut Software, now sold by H &amp; R Block. The site offers free help and advice in three categories of divorce problems: legal issues like custody, alimony and property division; financial issues like calculating child support or a pension's value; and lifestyle issues like stress and anger. It also has links for finding professional help in each state and sells software that provides more detailed assistance.</p>
