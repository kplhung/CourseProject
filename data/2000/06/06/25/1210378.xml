        <p>New York State moved to expand pilot programs that had shown some success in changing the lives of convicted drug addicts, by offering every nonviolent addict the option of treatment instead of jail. While all 50 states offer some form of court-mandated treatment, New York will be the first to make it an integral part of the system. The move is expected to move one-tenth of the state's 95,000 inmates from behind bars and into treatment programs, and save $500 million a year in prison, foster care and mental health costs.</p>
