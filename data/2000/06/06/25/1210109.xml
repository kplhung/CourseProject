        <p>THERE are bridges, and then there are bridges. There's a song about the 59th Street Bridge (kicking down its cobblestones made you feel groovy) and about the London Bridge. The Golden Gate is famously beautiful. And so on. But there are no songs about the Pulaski Skyway, which does not seem a pity at all.</p>
        <p>Though all bridges do the same job -- make a path across water or some yawning chasm -- some are fabled, others regarded merely as infrastructure.</p>
        <p>In Hunterdon County, not far from the Delaware River, stands a candidate that, if more people knew of its existence, would surely be the Garden State's most beloved bridge. It's neither the longest nor the oldest in the state. Like some nearly extinct bird, it  clings to its perch in all seasons, marking the passage of time.</p>
        <p>Green Sergeant's Bridge, just outside Sergeantsville in Delaware Township, is the state's only 19th-century covered bridge.</p>
        <p>If that sounds like hedging, you're quick. According to the Historic Preservation Office in Trenton, there are two other covered bridges in the state. But none share the Green Sergeant's pedigree: one was built in the Cherry Hill area in the 1950's, another in Somerset in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Such structures seem unbearably sweet today. New Jersey travelers are accustomed to seeking, and finding, covered bridges anywhere but here. If you've ever come within an inch of that perfect getaway weekend to New England (which includes a bed and breakfast stay, a country drive and the systematic acquisition of countless  homemade syrups, preserves and gewgaws you don't really need), then you know a covered bridge is a mandatory part of the package. People stop cars, pose loved ones, and snap photos of these bridges, all the  while cooing. A covered bridge is money-in-the-bank quaint.</p>
        <p>But when Charles Ogden Holcombe designed and started laying the timbers for this bridge in 1872, he was not thinking precious; he was thinking rot. Specifically, he wanted to keep rain water, snow and  morning mist from ever reaching the intricate joinery of his creation. As was the custom of his time, he sheathed the structure with a roof and walls. A pair of masons, Ely and Charles Everitt, were called in work on the abutments, the stone supports for the bridge, on either side of the Wickecheoke Creek. But they discovered, probably to their delight, that they didn't have to do too much work: the stone pillars, built before the American Revolution to support a previous stone bridge, were still in excellent shape.</p>
        <p>At the time, the surrounding farmland was owned by the Sergeant family. Charles Sergeant had bought the land in 1805, and when he died in 1833, the land passed to his son, Richard Green Sergeant.</p>
        <p>Today it's believed that local residents had called the stone bridge Green Sergeant's Bridge. They saw no reason to break precedent for the new-fangled covered bridge; today the bridge is listed in the national and state historic registers under that name.</p>
        <p>It sounds unbelievable, but at one time, there were as many as 75 covered bridges in the state. (Think of the homemade syrups, preserves, and gewgaws New Jerseyans could be foisting off on out-of-staters had they survived.) But one by one, they fell to age, time and rot, though the builders had taken such pains to shut out the elements.</p>
        <p>By 1955, only three of the bridges remained: Green Sergeant's Bridge and two  lengthy ones spanning the Delaware, at Raven Rock and Columbia. In that year a hurricane caused a flood that turned the Delaware spans into houseboats. Mr. Holcombe's structure stood its ground, barely. When inspectors got around to checking the bridge in 1959, they realized that it, too, had been seriously damaged, and recommended it be demolished and replaced.</p>
        <p>While history-loving residents clashed with the State Highway Department, the bridge collapsed. Workers collected the  pieces, numbered them and stowed them away. A stone marker on the site tells the rest of the story: ''In 1961, as a result of the  efforts of an aroused group of citizens, the state of New Jersey, using the materials of the original covered bridge, fully restored  this link with the past.'' Today the old bridge sits on Route 604 West; eastbound traffic is carried by its 1961 stone companion, the anti-quaintly named Bridge No. D304, which sits glumly beside its more colorful cousin.</p>
        <p>The older bridge seems more at home, blending into local scenery as if little has changed since 1872. A drive around the neighborhood leads through farmland dotted with dairy cows, horses and rolled hay, with occasional blips of small towns. Three of these -- Sergeantsville, Rosemont and Stockton -- form a kind of low-key country drive loop, from sleepiest to sleepy.</p>
        <p>Sergeantsville (which locals pronounce SIR-jents-vill), is nearest to the old bridge. Here, a former blacksmith shop houses a local FM radio station. An 1830's stone storehouse is now the Sergeantsville Inn, where diners drop in for a bit of ostrich,  venison or fillet of kangaroo. And cyclists who breeze through the countryside on weekends know to make a pit stop at the  Sergeantsville General Store, a town fixture since the late 1840's.</p>
        <p>For the last 10 years, though, the store has been managed by the family of Yuanyun Sun, a onetime electrical engineer from mainland China. Theirs is a quirky enterprise: the quintessential American general  store that happens to turns out the perfect $5 lunch of Chinese dumplings.</p>
        <p>Past the bridge and up the road is Rosemont, where yet another general store, this one dating from the end of the Civil War, stands at the crossroads, equidistant from an old cemetery, a bookbindery and a handful of antique shops.</p>
        <p>The Cafe at Rosemont, run by Lola Wykoff and Peg Peterson, is part restaurant, part art gallery, part local hangout. This is the kind of country store that cannot fail to  enchant: home-baked apple-rhubarb pies sitting out on the counter, a white enamel weight scale, butterscotch pudding cooling its heels next to wedges of Brie in the display cases, quirky sodas in the refrigerated case, old church pews squatting on the front porch and light jazz playing over the loudspeakers. Every Wednesday night is  international night, when the cooks in the back room turn out three-course meals inspired by different nation, or from different  American regions. This Wednesday is Thailand. Prix fixe is $18.</p>
        <p>Down Route 519 along the banks of the Delaware River brings drivers to Stockton, where New York literati hobnobbed with Dorothy Parker when she made an unsuccessful attempt at motherhood and country living in Bucks County. The Stockton Inn -- which inspired the Rodgers and Hart song about the ''small hotel with a wishing well'' and where Parker's cronies guzzled their gimlets and swapped bons mots -- dates, in part, from 1710. If the thought of availing  yourself of valet parking on your country drive turns you off, there's homespun Meil's across the street: corn fritters, chicken pot  pie, soft-shelled crabs and a dawn-to-dusk bakery make a warm welcome.</p>
        <p>FROM Stockton, it's a quick ride along Route 523 back to Sergeantsville and a chance to take another look at the old bridge. As the day dies, light slants along the trees and splashes shadows along its whitewashed back. So go ahead: pull over, park the car, take your photo -- and don't neglect the obligatory shot from inside looking out. Then hush yourself and listen: As cars drive through, their tires make a most satisfying sound -- ka-thunk, ka-thunk -- as they meet the deck planking. Trout-stocked waters splash over rocks below. And birds flit between the timbers, their chirps echoing as if in some roadside cathedral. This, then, is the secret of all covered bridges: their very novelty forces us out of our world and into theirs. They link us to far more than their builders ever dreamed.</p>
