        <p>Q: A gas leak was discovered in my building, which is rent-stabilized.  The landlord has begun replacing all of our gas lines, which were shut off by Consolidated Edison on April 13.  The floor, ceiling and walls of my kitchen now have gaping holes in them, and floor-to-ceiling piping has been installed on the outside face of a formerly usable wall.</p>
        <p>The landlord has not given me a satisfactory answer about when the holes will be repaired or how the pipes will be covered up. Because of the pipes I have lost several inches of living space and can no longer hang anything on this wall, including a light fixture and my artwork, which had been in place for almost eight years. Because of the gas shutoff, I have been unable to use my stove and have been forced to use my microwave and electric appliances much more than before.</p>

        <p>Q: A gas leak was discovered in my building, which is rent-stabilized.  The landlord has begun replacing all of our gas lines, which were shut off by Consolidated Edison on April 13.  The floor, ceiling and walls of my kitchen now have gaping holes in them, and floor-to-ceiling piping has been installed on the outside face of a formerly usable wall.</p>
        <p>The landlord has not given me a satisfactory answer about when the holes will be repaired or how the pipes will be covered up. Because of the pipes I have lost several inches of living space and can no longer hang anything on this wall, including a light fixture and my artwork, which had been in place for almost eight years. Because of the gas shutoff, I have been unable to use my stove and have been forced to use my microwave and electric appliances much more than before.</p>
        <p>Also, my privacy has been compromised because the holes in the ceiling go clean through to the upstairs apartments. Can I obtain a rent reduction for the loss of livable space, the loss of privacy and the increased electric costs I am being forced to endure? . . . Jill E. Mally, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A: Colleen F. McGuire, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer, said that it appears that the letter writer has suffered what is called a ''partial constructive eviction'' by being deprived of gas service, privacy and the ability to use part of her apartment. Accordingly, Ms. McGuire said, the tenant could try to get a reduction in rent by filing a complaint for a decrease in services with the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal.</p>
        <p>However, Ms. McGuire said, if the tenant is primarily concerned about having the gas restored, the pipes covered and the holes patched, she should file a petition in Housing Court asking the court to direct the landlord to repair all violations within a specific period of time.</p>
        <p>''She may wish to wage a two-pronged attack by withholding her rent until the problems are resolved,'' Ms. McGuire said, adding, however, that doing so would inevitably result in a lawsuit being filed against the tenant.</p>
        <p>She said that if the landlord were to file a nonpayment action, the tenant could answer that complaint with a counterclaim demanding an abatement of rent because of the breach of the warranty of habitability.</p>
        <p>Ms. McGuire said that while the tenant probably cannot get a reimbursement in Housing Court for the increased electrical costs she has incurred, she might be able to get a reimbursement by filing a small-claims action in civil court if the tenant considers the additional amount she is paying enough to warrant filing such an action.</p>
        <p>A Couple Serving On a Co-op Board</p>
        <p>Q: As a shareholder in a co-op, I am wondering about the legality or propriety of a couple, whether married or living together, serving at the same time on a co-op's board. Our bylaws do not address this issue.  Louis Friedman, Forest Hills, Queens.</p>
        <p>A: Aaron Shmulewitz, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that there is no prohibition under New York State law against a couple -- whether married or living together -- serving at the same time on a corporation's board.</p>
        <p>''Most co-op bylaws do not address this issue,'' Mr. Shmulewitz said.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, he said, if the bylaws of a particular co-op are silent on the matter, then the shareholders would be free to elect a couple who are living together to serve on the board, should the shareholders deem it prudent to do so.</p>
        <p>''Of course, doing so may very well not be prudent because it would create the likelihood of a concentrated voting bloc on the board,'' Mr. Shmulewitz said.</p>
