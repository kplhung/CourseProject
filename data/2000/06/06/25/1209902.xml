        <p>STANDING between millions of Americans and screening for colon cancer is the screening procedure itself: a blast of air into the rectum, followed by the insertion of an optical scope and 30 minutes or so of probing, all aided by continuous air pressure.</p>
        <p>But the exam, called a colonoscopy, unequivocally saves lives, because it allows doctors to detect and promptly remove polyps that might otherwise grow into cancerous tumors. As many as 96 percent of people who receive a diagnosis of colon cancer would survive at least five years if their malignancies were detected early, according to the National Cancer Institute.</p>
        <p>To make screening less offensive, more than a dozen academic medical centers are developing and testing a virtual colon exam, called CT colonography. In the procedure, the patient lies on a table, which is placed under the open arch of a computed tomography scanner that uses radiation to see into the colon.</p>
        <p>Patients are not sedated for the procedure, as is common with conventional colonoscopy, so there is little risk of complications or death. And because the new test is less invasive, discomfort is reduced.</p>
        <p>The unpleasantness, however, cannot be totally eliminated, said Dr. C. Dan Johnson, a professor of radiology at the Mayo Medical School in Rochester, Minn., and a leading CT colonography researcher. To ensure a good scan, patients must still empty their colons the day before. And as with colonoscopy, the colon has to be inflated with air through a tube inserted into the rectum.</p>
        <p>A colonoscopy's accuracy, and the ease with which it allows polyps to be removed, makes it ''the gold standard,'' said Dr. Abraham H. Dachman, the director of computed tomography at the University of Chicago Medical Center. The accuracy of colonography has yet to be determined, he said; it is expected to cost less, however. And as Dr. Johnson pointed out, ''From a patient's perspective, this is more comfortable, faster and better tolerated.''</p>
