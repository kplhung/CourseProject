        <p>A proposal to build a $5 million public swimming pool complex in Somers was rejected Tuesday, the third time in three decades that residents have voted against a pool. The vote was 3,458 to 1,475. Supporters said the pool would be a central gathering place in Somers, one of Westchester's only townships without a public pool. Opponents called the complex too large, too expensive and too invasive on the rural character of the town. Town officials said the vote had the biggest turnout for a referendum in recent history. ''It was unbelievable,'' Margaret Quartironeye, the town clerk, said. ''They were lined up around the parking lot outside Town Hall.''</p>
