        <p>Americans don't automatically reach for sparkling wine on the Fourth of July. But East Enders can patriotically drink two new ones from Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>The nonvintage Macari brut, the first sparkling wine from Macari Vineyards in Mattituck, is ambitious and impressive.</p>
        <p>It is simple and as bracingly refreshing as a well-wrought 6:30 p.m. gin and tonic doused by a squeezed lime chip. The citrus impression is brought to mind by a  grapefruitlike acidity that lingers in an especially long finish. Others may find a Granny Smith apple crispness in the texture.</p>
        <p>This lightly toasty brut ($17) contains not a calorie of the fleshy richness found in many California sparkling wines. Spare and food-oriented, and made by the French-born Gilles Martin, Macari's former winemaker, it more nearly resembles certain nearly weightless Champagnes.</p>
        <p>(Charles Girard, from Saumur in the Loire Valley, joined Macari as a winemaker this week. He will share the responsibility with Jose Montilla, who arrived in November. Previously, Mr. Montilla made cava, Spanish sparkling wine, near Barcelona.)</p>
        <p>Chill Macari's wine deeply in an ice bucket for 20 minutes, keep it there and treat it less as an aperitif than a food wine, starting with hors d'oeuvres.</p>
        <p>The soon-to-be-released 1993 Lieb Family Cellars sparkling wine, made wholly (and unconventionally) from pinot blanc grapes harvested at Lieb Vineyards in Cutchogue, is simple, angular, wispily fruity and bracingly dry.</p>
        <p>No surprise. This pale, grapefruity wine was made by Eric Fry at the Lenz Winery in Peconic, where the sparkling-wine style over the years has tilted toward a leanness and crispness that complements meals.</p>
        <p>No aperitif, Marc Lieb's first sparkling wine ($20) will dovetail best at dinner with delicate fish, chicken and pork dishes. Some 260 cases were made, for local distribution only. ''I want to keep it basically on the East End,'' he said.</p>
