        <p>Some say a first-rate bartender needs only three things: a healthy pitching arm, a strong pair of legs and a stomach sturdy enough to absorb the effluvial tide of human misery that surges toward him each night from the other side of the oak.</p>
        <p>''I am inclined to reserve all judgments,'' Nick Carraway observed in ''The Great Gatsby,'' ''a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores.'' Though F. Scott Fitzgerald was describing the plight of a poor man in a rich man's world, the point could certainly apply to the lot of the tavern master.</p>

        <p>Some say a first-rate bartender needs only three things: a healthy pitching arm, a strong pair of legs and a stomach sturdy enough to absorb the effluvial tide of human misery that surges toward him each night from the other side of the oak.</p>
        <p>''I am inclined to reserve all judgments,'' Nick Carraway observed in ''The Great Gatsby,'' ''a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores.'' Though F. Scott Fitzgerald was describing the plight of a poor man in a rich man's world, the point could certainly apply to the lot of the tavern master.</p>
        <p>And if bartenders have yet to discover their great writer, they may have found their lore keeper in Dale DeGroff.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeGroff is a debonairly raffish man who made his bartending bones at the Rainbow Room, where he spent more than a decade as the chief mixologist. These days, you can find him sporting around town at bars like Grace in TriBeCa or holding seminars on everything from mint juleps to sloe gin fizz.</p>
        <p>A dapper gent with a graying mane, Mr. DeGroff proudly wears his Bartenders Hall of Fame ring (class of 1992) and has a penchant for biting off the ends of his thoughts with a roguish, squint-eyed smile. In the jargon of his business, he is three parts Stork Club, two parts Las Vegas and one part scholar of the trade.</p>
        <p>''The bartender is an American phenomenon just like jazz or baseball,'' he mused the other day at Phebe's, a bar on the Bowery, while romancing a Bombay Sapphire martini made to his NASA-quality specifications: up, dry, with an olive and a twist, and backed by a tumbler of water.</p>
        <p>''It used to be that people who served alcohol were innkeepers,'' Mr. DeGroff said. ''The man looked after the house and the horses and his wife was in charge of the bar. But real bartenders emerged from that classic British mold around 1830 in this country. That's when they first became professionalized.''</p>
        <p>It was in 1862, he said, that the first saloonkeepers' guide appeared in America under the title of ''How to Mix Drinks, or a Bon Vivant's Companion.'' It was written by Jerry Thomas, the paterfamilias of bartenders. Mr. DeGroff, a devoted student, owns a crackle-paged first edition.</p>
        <p>During the next 60 years, until Prohibition, an explosion of new ingredients like dry vermouth reached this country. Men were called into service to prepare martinis, Manhattans, sours and Rusty Nails. The bartender was no mere tap jockey but a beverage chef, concocting decorative and cultivated cocktails.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeGroff is a throwback to those artisanal days. He considers the liquor well  his palette, the bar his canvas. During his own stint manning the wood, he played a game with his favorite customers, offering to make them cocktails with the booze they hated most. If it wasn't delicious it was free. He rarely lost, he says.</p>
        <p>''Bartending is a profession based on flavor and recipe,'' he offered, as a ray of sunset slanted through the window and brightened the last drops of his martini. ''It's like an art. You have to ground yourself in anatomy before you can go off painting crazy things.''</p>
