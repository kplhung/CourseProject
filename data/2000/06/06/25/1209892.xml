        <p>GROWING up, I compiled rosters of all-Jewish sports teams. Basketball was easy, football impossible, baseball possible with pitchers in the outfield. It seemed to me an obvious way to affirm my people's power and possibility; only later did it seem like a pathetic form of assimilation.</p>
        <p>Now, as I compile rosters of all-cancer-survivor teams (basketball and football are impossible, baseball possible with some infield shuffling), I'm again using muscular heroes to counteract images of my own vulnerability.</p>
        <p>Since sports is still a predominantly male mind-set, my current rosters may offer inspiring role models who have come back from chemotherapy with their competitive ferocity and batting eye intact, but also with mixed messages.</p>
        <p>Yes, there is a great deal we can learn from the way jocks deal with life-threatening illnesses. No, they are not necessarily better than their fans at seeking timely treatment. And, furthermore, the short-term goals of elite athletes and the enormous differences between their bodies and mine can make certain assumptions detrimental to my health.</p>
        <p>My current sports role model, the cyclist Lance Armstrong, delivers all the messages. Because, as do most men, he postponed seeking medical advice for his symptoms, he goes straight to the Denial Hall of Fame. But once his testicular cancer was diagnosed -- it had spread to his brain, abdomen and lungs -- he attacked it as if it were a hill on the Tour de France.</p>
        <p>The day after he won that race, arguably the most demanding event in all of sports, I went out and bought the first really good bike I have ever owned. I was soon riding at speed. I amazed myself by pedaling up to a 35-mile trip. I conquered steep hills simply by repeating ''Lance Armstrong'' until I reached the top. On the way down, trying not to brake, I would remind myself that my own recovery from a far less advanced case of testicular cancer had also been far less spectacular and ambitious. Coming back to everyday life for me was once again asking people questions and writing their answers. That's hardly everyday life for a jock.</p>
        <p>It's an important distinction.</p>
        <p>One reason most retired pro athletes walk stiffly and have even more trouble getting up from soft chairs than I do is that they were so often rushed back into further collisions before their last wounds healed. Resting for a week with his leg up is not an option for an athlete whose team has a title game tonight. Team doctors are sometimes no better than coaches about pushing athletes onto the field too soon.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, an athlete will retire, saying, ''I want to be able to play with my kids in 10 years.'' More often, he will take the Faustian bargain of glory now, disability later. But cancer is a different ballgame.</p>
        <p>Twenty years ago, toward the end of my chemo protocol at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, I would notice patients, nurses and doctors fluttering around a big young guy who was also undergoing treatment.</p>
        <p>Eventually, I found out it was a New York Giants football player, Dan Lloyd, who had lymphoma. My return to everyday life included a new job, as a correspondent for ''CBS Sunday Morning With Charles Kuralt.'' Perhaps not so coincidentally, my first report was on Lloyd.</p>
        <p>Typically, he had been slow to seek treatment. When one side of his neck bulged with what would prove to be swollen glands, he told his wife that he hoped the other side would swell to match it; he had always envied thick-necked linebackers who could use their heads as battering rams. But once his cancer was diagnosed, again typically, he confronted it as a game to be won. He gathered information, not easy in those off-line days, took personal responsibility for weighing options and setting up schedules, and treated doctors as if they were assistant coaches, human beings with specialized knowledge but no supernatural powers. (His own defensive coach at that time was one Bill Parcells.)</p>
        <p>He fell back on the athlete's discipline and belief that with enough effort he could conquer all. He rode a stationary bike in the hospital, ran and pumped iron between chemo treatments, and concocted a fantasy about a ''physical bank account'' in which every mile he ran, pound he lifted, minute he stretched was a deposit that could be withdrawn when the chemo made him sick and weak.</p>
        <p>By any normal person's standard, Lloyd won big; he regained his strength, and tests showed no evidence of disease. But after he hurt his leg in practice, the Giants shelved him on injured reserve. The club was deep in linebacker talent then, and concerned about the possibility of bones weakened by chemo.</p>
        <p>So Lloyd retired at 29 and began making calls to put into play his longtime plan of becoming a high school coach.  But in his own mind he had not quite beaten cancer yet. He needed to sack one more quarterback. We would joke that my story about him had a happy ending, but that his story of him was incomplete.</p>
        <p>A year later, encouraged by the high school athletes he was coaching, Lloyd tried out for the Michigan Panthers, the best team in the short-lived United States Football League. In his third game, bursting out of a three-point stance, he snagged a finger on the artificial turf and snapped a tendon. He was out for the season. But he had finally beaten cancer by the only valid criterion. He had returned to his version of everyday life.</p>
        <p>And that's the standard for making my all-cancer baseball team. The outfield is superb: Darryl Strawberry, currently on suspension from the Yankees, came back from colon cancer, although not from other demons; Eric Davis of the St. Louis Cardinals, also a colon cancer survivor, batted well during chemo while with the Baltimore Orioles, and Brett Butler of the Los Angeles Dodgers, who scored the winning run in his first game back from throat cancer in 1996. He has since retired.</p>
        <p>The infield is strong. At first base, Andres Galarraga of the Atlanta Braves, who was sidelined with lymphoma all last year. This season, at 38, he had three game-winning home runs, including a grand slam, in his first five games. He was hitting well over .300 at last look. At second, Mike Gallego, who had testicular cancer in the minor leagues, but came up to the majors for a long career with Oakland and the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Mike Lowell, a clutch hitter with a steady glove, missed the first 48 games of his rookie season last year after surgery for testicular cancer. He's back at third base for the Florida Marlins, but I'm moving him to shortstop to make room for John Kruk, who returned to the Phillies after testicular cancer. Kruk was a first baseman, but I think he'll make it at third.</p>
        <p>Pitcher Dave Dravecky returned to the San Francisco Giants in 1989 after a cancerous tumor was removed fom his left shoulder. Eventually, his throwing arm was amputated. In relief, we have Scott Radinsky, who had Hodgkin's disease in 1994, then came back to pitch for the White Sox and the Dodgers. Catching them will be Eli Marrero of the Cardinals, who had a cancerous thyroid gland removed. Coaching them will be the Yankees' Mel Stottlemyre, who has multiple myeloma. They will be managed by his boss, Joe Torre, back from prostate cancer treatment.</p>
        <p>THE relative openness with which these athletes have talked about their cancers is new and, if it leads to greater awareness of symptoms among their fans and a quicker run to treatment, potentially significant. Typically, men do not go to doctors as often, or as soon after symptoms develop, as women do. Whether it is asking for driving directions or for medical attention, men seem not to want to appear uncertain or vulnerable. Unlike women, most men have no history of routine medical visits for early gynecological exams, or to take children for checkups. Furthermore, male conditioning, particularly in sports, calls for ignoring pain and playing hurt. Real men walk on broken legs, shake off concussions.</p>
        <p>To counteract such damaging behavior, the Institute of Cancer Research in Britain recently used athletes on a poster during its ''Everyman male cancer awareness  month.'' Soccer, cricket, rugby and snooker players, a jockey and a sprinter were shown with their hands shielding their crotches.  The point of the campaign was the cost of avoiding medical advice out of macho pride. Prostate cancer is overtaking lung cancer in Britain as the commonest cancer in men,  while testicular cancer is most common in the age group of elite athletes, as our baseball team seems to indicate.</p>
        <p>While cancer is finally being seen as a manly disease that jocks, politicians and generals can talk about, mental illness is still deep in the locker. Many athletes are using antidepressants, but few beyond pitcher Pete Harnisch, of the Cincinnati Reds, and the recently retired Hall of Fame jockey Julie Krone are talking about it.</p>
        <p>Putting together an all-psychiatric-disorder baseball team is impossible right now. But when I do, my all-cancer team will seem like just another pathetic attempt at assimilation.</p>
