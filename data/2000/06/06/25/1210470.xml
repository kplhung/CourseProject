        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>That's some overwhelming coverage The Times gave the United States national soccer team recently. What with playing a rival like Mexico, whom we have beaten only once before and always play pretty tightly, it was great to see so much coverage. I don't think a day went by that I didn't scour the sports page in vain looking for one word about the June 11 matchup. We're not only playing an established rival, but World Cup qualifiers are right around the corner. Is it asking too much to follow our national team?</p>
        <p>I spent the week ending June 3 in D.C. and found The Washington Post planting a story every day regarding the Saturday match versus the South Africans. I think The Times's coverage was embarrassing.</p>

        <p>Against Mexico at Giants Stadium, I saw a team that not only controlled midfield but could have also scored at least five or six goals.</p>
