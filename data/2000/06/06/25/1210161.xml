        <p>After 20 years of teaching children to be skeptical shoppers, Zillions magazine will print its last issue this summer. As of Sept. 1, Zillions, the kid brother of Consumer Reports magazine, published by Consumers Union in Yonkers, will instead become an online magazine.(www.Zillions.org.)</p>
        <p>''I wish we could have done both, start the Web site and continue to publish the magazine,'' said Charlotte M. Baecher, the editor of Zillions. ''But kids are migrating so much to the Internet, it made it very clear to us that that's where we needed to go to meet kids.''</p>

        <p>To maintain its independence, Zillions, which began in 1980 as Penny Power, did not run advertisements and relied on subscriptions for revenue. At its height, the magazine had about 350,000 subscribers, Ms. Baecher said. Now there are about 100,000.</p>
