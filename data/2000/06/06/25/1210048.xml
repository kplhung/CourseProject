        <p>Frank O'Hara</p>
        <p>Parrish Art Museum, 25 Job's Lane, Southampton. Through July 30. (631) 283-2118.</p>
        <p>Mentally as well as visually engaging, ''In Memory of My Feelings: Frank O'Hara and American Art'' deserves to be appreciated as a rich and illuminating cultural essay. It uses poems by O'Hara (1926-1966) and pieces by artists within his orbit to examine cross-influences and common sensibilities, concentrating on the period from 1950 to the year of the poet's accidental death. Admired for his pioneering treatment of language, O'Hara was also respected as an art critic and as a curator at the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
        <p>Organized by Russell Ferguson, associate curator of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, where the exhibition was seen last year, the presentation offers considerable insight into the transition from Abstract Expressionism to Pop and subsequent developments. Most important, it calls attention to the way O'Hara translated ordinary experience and the reality of the moment into valid creative endeavors. It was an outlook that helped others to confidently pursue their own experiments with turning real things into art.</p>

        <p>Frank O'Hara</p>
        <p>Parrish Art Museum, 25 Job's Lane, Southampton. Through July 30. (631) 283-2118.</p>
        <p>Mentally as well as visually engaging, ''In Memory of My Feelings: Frank O'Hara and American Art'' deserves to be appreciated as a rich and illuminating cultural essay. It uses poems by O'Hara (1926-1966) and pieces by artists within his orbit to examine cross-influences and common sensibilities, concentrating on the period from 1950 to the year of the poet's accidental death. Admired for his pioneering treatment of language, O'Hara was also respected as an art critic and as a curator at the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
        <p>Organized by Russell Ferguson, associate curator of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, where the exhibition was seen last year, the presentation offers considerable insight into the transition from Abstract Expressionism to Pop and subsequent developments. Most important, it calls attention to the way O'Hara translated ordinary experience and the reality of the moment into valid creative endeavors. It was an outlook that helped others to confidently pursue their own experiments with turning real things into art.</p>
        <p>The show's title is that of an O'Hara poem. It was also used by Jasper Johns for a two-part canvas joined by metal hinges that prominently features a fork and spoon attached by wire to a painterly surface. With its utensils suspended over a dense covering of gray pigment strokes, the work is a good example of the merger of abstraction's ambiguity and the specifics of life.</p>
        <p>Nearby, an O'Hara poem offers a reminder of how his language contains parallels to ideas evidenced in the surrounding art. References to objects and clothing flow into others that suggest action and uncertainty. His swift, spontaneous responses to the world are echoed in a fine example from Willem de Kooning's studies of women.</p>
        <p>There is much evidence, too, of the physical interweaving of text and art. In ''Ode on Necrophilia,'' O'Hara created a surface configuration with words. In other instances he collaborated with artists like Larry Rivers, Franz Kline, Norman Bluhm, Joe Brainard, Michael Goldberg and Alfred Leslie to create pieces that extend the possibilities of language and perception. Leslie's film, ''The Last Clean Shirt,'' which runs on a small screen in the rear gallery, uses O'Hara's subtitles to shape an exciting and radically different kind of communication.</p>
        <p>In numerous portrayals of O'Hara there is the feeling that the artist was seeking to make the image convey his energy and personality. Alex Katz's portrait, cut from a wood plank, is a free-standing, intensely alert figure poised on toepoint and seemingly ready to move anywhere. In paintings by Jane Freilicher, Elaine de Kooning and Alice Neel, the looseness of the pigment gestures appear to retain the subject's restless energy.</p>
        <p>Robert Dash</p>
        <p>Lizan Tops Gallery, 66 Newtown Lane, East Hampton. Through July 4. (631) 324-3424.</p>
        <p>Between his earliest and more recent investigations of abstraction, Robert Dash turned his attention to the exterior and interior settings that form the core of this mini-survey spanning the 1959 to 1983 period.</p>
        <p>Characterized by a reductive synthesis of flat, expressive color applied as strokes and forms that are more independent than descriptive, the paintings are full of calculated adjustments. Some allow specific tones to achieve a magical illumination, while others invent either an order that suggests the meditative qualities of a calm environment or a turbulence that hovers tensely between natural and manmade forces.</p>
        <p>''Big Autumn Puddle,'' depicting a segment of a typical residential street, is an example of the way many of the landscapes take their sparkle from a sharp juxtaposition of dark and light tones. It also stands out as a theme that provides a watery mass for additional controlled repetitions of shapes and colors.</p>
        <p>In general, it is the compelling, subjective skies, an important sub-theme, that give the exhibition its most lasting impact. Filled with arbitrary shapes and unpredictable colors that introduce their own visual action, they tend to bring together light, memory, and a knowledge of abstraction to produce something quite original.</p>
        <p>One wall is devoted to vibrant small pastels from the series ''History of the Sky.'' Intuitive notations, their churning areas of color coalesce in the center of the sheet as if they were objects having weight and proportion, defying the concept of sky as a grand continuum.</p>
        <p>Naito/Schaumburger</p>
        <p>Hillwood Art Museum, C. W. Post campus, Brookville. Through June 30. (516) 299-4073.</p>
        <p>The rear, curved gallery at the Hillwood Art Museum, one of the Island's most dramatic showcases for art, has been turned into a very effective otherworldly installation by Jiro Naito, a sculptor known primarily for cut-steel pieces that combine stark formal intrigues with conceptual underpinnings. Often, as is the case here, angle and position are part of the content and there is an interest in testing the expressive potential of space.</p>
        <p>About a dozen steel units rest on a carpet divided into red, yellow and blue sections and are surrounded by illumination that continues the scheme of primary colors. Everything is designed to pick up reflections in this sensuous work, and visitors have the feeling of being inside a disintegrating prism .</p>
        <p>In the museum's entrance gallery, Ann Schaumburger's bold, figurative paintings seem to fuse suggestions of narrative content with flat, rhythmic decorative patterns. Story specifics are left to the imagination.</p>
        <p>There is a slick, emblematic quality that has a certain sophistication, even though the silhouetted shapes representing animals, humans and objects contain a degree of childlike naivete. Examples that manage to be mystical and dreamlike are among the most successful.</p>
