        <p>Take a Pier One Imports and cross it with Barnes &amp; Noble, gene splice it with Martha Stewart and plant the hybrid in a 33,000-square-foot garden center. The result is New Jersey's first Burpee Gardens store and cafe.</p>
        <p>Or as Greg Wilson, the store manager, put it: ''We don't call it a store. We call it an 'upscale experience.' You can come in and just hang out, watch TV, go online on one of our IMAC computers -- to gardening sites  -- have lunch and just experience it all.''</p>
        <p>There are only two other Burpee Gardens in the country -- in Downers Grove, Ill., near Chicago, and Horsham, Pa., outside Philadelphia -- and all three opened within the last two months.</p>
        <p>Depending on how the stores do here and in Downers Grove, the company might expand in the South and West, said George Ball, chairman and chief executive of Ball Resources in Glen Ellyn, Ill. The story in Horsham, an old factory outlet, does not have all the amenities of those two stores.</p>
        <p>So much for catalogues and packages of seed.</p>
        <p>''People ask me why I don't just do focus groups, but that doesn't give the kind of information I want to collect,'' Mr. Ball said in a telephone interview. ''I want a different quality of information that comes from beyond our current customer base. Surveys and groups only go so far.''</p>
        <p>He added that it was not possible to get a complete picture of people's buying habits from the Burpee Catalog, which generates about 750,000 sales a year and offers its products through 16,000 retail stores like Kmart and others. Nor would the stores give Burpee free rein.</p>
        <p>''Kmart would let us dress up as a carrot and give out seed packets but they wouldn't let us experiment with how displays were set up or where they were located,'' Mr. Ball said. ''Now, I can go in and say to these guys, 'At our Medford store the displays work like this and it sells.' And then they  listen.''</p>
        <p>So far, he said, the fledgling stores have done well. ''It's spring,'' Mr. Ball said. ''They'd better do well. It's making it a year-round business that tells the tale. I am going for a sort of British Victorian-style  emporium in these stores and see how people here buy under those conditions.''</p>
        <p>Marion Marcoinni, 79, and her friend Susan Hammar, 50, both of Mount</p>
        <p>Laurel, spent an hour one recent afternoon wandering throughout the store, which looks like a chic airplane hangar with waterfalls, trees and gee-gaws in rich display beside hand-painted cedar furniture.</p>
        <p>There are baskets, jewelry, candles, housewares and such CD's as ''Celtic Romance'' and ''Spring Symphonies.''</p>
        <p>A full-time florist is tucked in one corner and classes in floral arranging are offered on the weekends. Leaving no garden stone unturned, the florist does arrangements for weddings and other affairs.</p>
        <p>Near the center of the store is a circular setting of couches and chairs beneath a circular overhang of televisions where Martha Stewart and others chattily turn radishes into tasty doorknobs and pot geraniums on the Home and Garden Television Network. This is also part of the book nook where volumes on flora by Ball Publishing and others are priced from $10 to $75.</p>
        <p>And yes, there is also a solid wall of the seeds that made Burpee famous. Ms. Marcionni and Ms. Hammar were fortifying themselves in the Starbucks-like Sunflower Cafe before taking on the greenhouses and outdoor floral garden centers.</p>
        <p>''It's terrific,'' Ms. Marcoionni said as she nibbled cheesecake and sipped on a cup of macchiato latte. ''I live in a retirement village and only have a tiny balcony, but I found a precious little watering can and  some flowers, a bird feeder. The coffee and cakes are very good too.''</p>
        <p>For local growers and garden centers, the question is how to compete against this Big Plant store.</p>
        <p>Peter Johnson, owner of Johnson's Farm, about a mile away, said his greenhouse and bedding plant business was sure to suffer.</p>
        <p>''The place is beautiful,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''I'm not going to bad-mouth Burpee. I'm not going to cry about it. I'm going to try and find out what they're not doing well and do it better. They don't have a farm, fresh baked goods, a place to take the kids out in the sunshine for a day. Now if they put in a  bakery I'm going to be upset.''</p>
        <p>W. Atlee Burpee founded the company in 1876 in Philadelphia. Mr. Burpee, 18 years old at the time, began by selling baby chicks by mail. But quickly realizing that customers would also want seed for vegetables and grain for feed, Mr. Burpee borrowed $1,000 from his mother and expanded the business. Mr. Burpee began breeding vegetables and  introducing more hardy seed stocks and innovations in the field.</p>
        <p>One of Burpee's best-known varieties was the Brandywine (a.k.a. Mikado or Turner's Hybrid tomato) in 1886, followed by Iceberg lettuce, introduced in 1894.</p>
        <p>The company was sold in 1991 to George J. Ball of Chicago, owner of the Ball Seed Company and Ball Publishing, whose son George Ball Jr. runs the company today.</p>
        <p>In the sense that the founder's name has always been synonymous with innovation and hybrids, this store has not fallen far from the Burpee tree. That's the case, too, with many of the customers.</p>
        <p>Bob Smith, 42, of Browns Mills, said he was sent to the store ''to check it out'' by his 76-year-old father, Stephen Smith, also of Browns Mills.</p>
        <p>''Dad's always ordered from Burpee as long as I can remember,'' Mr. Smith said.  ''This is something else. I'm going home to get dad. He's just got to see this.''</p>
        <p>Philip Reilly, 65 of Wayne, Pa., said he was on his way to his shore home in Barnegat Light when he saw the Burpee sign.</p>
        <p>''My Dad bought Burpee seeds for years and years and years,'' Mr. Reilly said, a potted rosebush in his hand. ''I saw that sign and I had to stop. I'll plant the roses down the shore house and maybe stop on the way home for something for the other house.''</p>
        <p>Yes, but would Mr. Reilly -- dressed in his work shirt work shirt, industrial navy blue pants and red suspenders -- stop for a mocha latte or perhaps a scented candle?  I'll stick with the roses,'' he said. ''The other things around here look a little fancy.''</p>
