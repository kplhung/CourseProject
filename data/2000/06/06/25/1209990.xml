        <p>1. Ross Anderson has designed offices for bn.com and the late Tibor Kalman's firm M&amp;Co., and is at work on an office campus for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch in Ohio. Nearing completion is a 30,000-square-foot floor that he designed for Talk magazine in Manhattan. Bisecting the 16-foot-high open office space -- inspired by the New York Public Library's reading room -- is a blocklong swath of 20 private offices. They're enclosed in a thin aluminum structure, inset with translucent glass and plastic panels in a Mondrian-like arrangement that glows from within.</p>
        <p>2. Nina Santisi was Isaac Mizrahi's vice president for advertising and public relations for 10 years. But when she served as executive producer of Douglas Keeve's 1995 documentary on Mizrahi, ''Unzipped,'' Santisi knew there was no turning back. Now she's producing ''Rodeo Girl'' (also directed by Keeve), a documentary based on Lisa Eisner's photographic book of the same name, and ''The Adventures of Sandee the Supermodel,'' a live-action feature film for DreamWorks based on the comic book written by Mizrahi and illustrated by William Frawley.</p>

        <p>1. Ross Anderson has designed offices for bn.com and the late Tibor Kalman's firm M&amp;Co., and is at work on an office campus for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch in Ohio. Nearing completion is a 30,000-square-foot floor that he designed for Talk magazine in Manhattan. Bisecting the 16-foot-high open office space -- inspired by the New York Public Library's reading room -- is a blocklong swath of 20 private offices. They're enclosed in a thin aluminum structure, inset with translucent glass and plastic panels in a Mondrian-like arrangement that glows from within.</p>
        <p>2. Nina Santisi was Isaac Mizrahi's vice president for advertising and public relations for 10 years. But when she served as executive producer of Douglas Keeve's 1995 documentary on Mizrahi, ''Unzipped,'' Santisi knew there was no turning back. Now she's producing ''Rodeo Girl'' (also directed by Keeve), a documentary based on Lisa Eisner's photographic book of the same name, and ''The Adventures of Sandee the Supermodel,'' a live-action feature film for DreamWorks based on the comic book written by Mizrahi and illustrated by William Frawley.</p>
        <p>3. One of Anderson's inspirations for the house was Vermont's covered bridges; the state has more covered bridges that are still in use than all other New England states combined. Shown here is the Creamery Bridge in Brattleboro, but the 280-foot-long Dummerston Bridge, not far from Anderson's cabin, is the longest one in the state.</p>
        <p>4. One of Anderson's architectural mentors (and fellow rugged individualists) is Turner Brooks. Brooks's buildings, like the red house shown here (a), display the ''twisted vernacular'' sensibility that pervades Anderson's work. When Brooks was a fellow at the American Academy in Rome in 1984, he designed Il Risorgimento -- a cross between an obelisk and a pyramid, with canvas wings -- which somehow recalls the vernacular structures of his New England childhood. The architect hauled his minimonument (b) around Rome, photographing it at better-known landmarks like (left to right), the Trevi Fountain, Bramante's Tempietto and the Piazza Navona.</p>
        <p>5. Most of the cabin's furniture is secondhand midcentury modern. Asked to choose a favorite new chair, Anderson opted for the ''leggy, wiggly, fuzzy, insectlike'' Pernilla 3 lounge chair, designed in 1944 by the Swedish master Bruno Mathsson. The chair shown here is covered in lamb's wool; it's $3,519 at Scandinavian Design, (212) 213-0009.</p>
        <p>6. The cabin's first phase was just its wooden platform, on which tents were pitched. Anderson's tent of choice is the 10-ounce Canvas Prospector Wall Tent from Fort McPherson Tent and Canvas Shop, located just above the Arctic Circle. ''It's a beautiful thing when lit from within,'' he says, ''and it's bugproof.'' The popular 10-by-12-foot size is $700 (Canadian), from the Arctic Canada Trading Company Ltd., (867) 766-7722.</p>
        <p>7. No plumbing? No problem. The $899 Sun-Mar Excel-NE composting toilet doesn't need electricity, so it's ''perfect for folks who live off the grid,'' as the Real Goods catalog says. (800) 919-2400; www.realgoods.com/renew.</p>
        <p>8. To repel the vernacular insects -- black flies and mosquitoes -- Sam's Outdoor Outfitters in Brattleboro suggested Ben's, available in the 100 Max formula which is 95 percent DEET (put it on your clothing, not your skin), and the milder 30 Wilderness Formula. (802) 254-2933.</p>
        <p>9. Newfane, Vt., is just a few miles from the cabin. The Four Columns Inn, (800) 787-6633, offers charming rooms, some of which overlook the 1830's town green. Mick Jagger celebrated his 40th birthday there.</p>
