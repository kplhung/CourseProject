        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Microsoft Will Test Justices' Prowess'' (June 4) asked whether the Supreme Court justices have the  technical competence to address the Microsoft antitrust case. As a former antitrust lawyer, I think that the court will have little difficulty.</p>
        <p>But the important question is whether existing antitrust legislation, conceived 100 years ago, is an appropriate standard for evaluating anticompetitive behavior today.</p>
        <p>Consider that the economy was heavily industrialized at the turn of the 20th century and that railroads were the only effective means of transportation. Entry barriers to new competitors were formidable. A  railroad or steel company that engaged in anticompetitive conduct could do enormous economic damage. Contrast that to today's high-tech world where the half-life of firms is very short, business models are rapidly rendered obsolete, and there are often no appreciable entry barriers.</p>
        <p>As powerful as Microsoft may be, it is fair to question whether its current business model will even be relevant in 10 years.</p>
        <p>This is not to say that high-technology companies are incapable of anticompetitive conduct, or that the antitrust laws should be scrapped. To the contrary. But the question remains whether the antitrust laws should be amended in light of today's different economic world. The statute books are full of examples where the Congress has recognized that unique industry characteristics call for a unique regulatory regime.</p>
        <p>But judges are not legislators; the task of revisiting antitrust policy belongs to Congress. The court may correctly apply the law in this case, but we may regret the consequences.</p>
