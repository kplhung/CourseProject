        <p>OF all the zingers uttered by my obstetrician, Alan DeCherney (known for his great delivery, in every sense of the word), the most memorable was when I told him that I thought I wanted to squat while giving birth. ''And what am I supposed to do?'' he demanded. ''Get down on the floor in a raincoat?''</p>
        <p>The year was 1987. The hospital was Yale-New Haven. Note that I said hospital. As an elderly primagravida (loosely translated, a first-time mom-to-be who will be receiving mail from the AARP by the time her child is in middle school), my concern was not so much to experience childbirth as to survive it.</p>
        <p>That sudden desire to squat was but an aberration, inspired, no doubt, by patchouli-scented memories of the late 70's, a heyday of home births, my own niece Anna's among them. I was there, cowering on the sidelines, camera ready. Anna and her parents have her arrival graphically documented in a complete set of black-and-white portraits, which they have never shown to anyone.</p>
        <p>But returning to 1987, little did I know, when I finally yelled at Dr. DeCherney, ''Just give me an epidural!'' that I was echoing the cry of countless other mothers of that era. I was, in fact, on the cusp of a counterrevolution -- the liberation-from-labor movement.</p>
        <p>Today, about 99 percent of births happen in hospitals, and, according to Dr. DeCherney, who is now the chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Medicine, about 90 percent of women are opting for epidurals.</p>
        <p>''You mean people aren't doing all the breathing anymore?'' I asked. ''Lamaze? Bradley?''</p>
        <p>''Nope,'' he said. ''They do go to childbirth education classes, and they learn a little breathing and hygiene and nutrition. But that kind of religious commitment to natural childbirth seems to have waned.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, according to Penny Simkin, a Seattle nurse-midwife and a co-author of ''Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Newborn: The Complete Guide,'' induced births are becoming more routine. The National Center for Health Statistics backs her up. In 1997, 18 percent of births were induced -- twice as many as in 1989. ''Things are about as high-tech as they can get,'' Ms. Simkin said.</p>
        <p>In 1984, when things were still about as low-tech as they ever got in recent history, Ms. Simkin invented the squatting bar, which is installed over the bed so that women can harness the pull of gravity. Now, she more often finds  squatting bars in the backs of linen closets in hospitals.</p>
        <p>The latest trend, she said, is to book your induction or your Caesarean months ahead, a strategy that seems just right for a time when many expectant mothers' major source of birthing advice is the Internet. It is also ideal for two-career parents -- and doctors -- who don't want nature to disrupt their busy schedules, and for insurance companies for whom speedy deliveries are a priority.</p>
        <p>But not all women have fallen under the spell of convenience. Some still insist on the labor-intensive approach, long preferred by midwives, who tend to believe that since birth, after all, comes naturally, women are better off going with the flow. And midwives -- who almost disappeared by the doctor-dominated 1950's, but regained momentum in the 70's -- have now become as permanent a presence on the birthing scene as medications and monitors.</p>
        <p>According to the American College of Nurse-Midwifery, there are 5,700 certified nurse-midwives working in the United States, mostly in hospitals and clinics.</p>
        <p>Today's high-tech midwives, however, still tend to champion low-tech innovations like water birth, which Ms. Simkin calls ''the midwife's epidural.'' Remember the Leboyer method, in which the room was darkened and the newborn was immediately dunked in tepid water to ease separation anxiety? Well, that's history. But these days, a pregnant woman has the option of easing her anxiety, and pain, by dunking her whole body in a big tub throughout labor. Some women even give birth while immersed.</p>
        <p>Water birth is very popular in Russia as well as in Seattle, where most birthing accommodations have tubs. It is catching on around the country, too, and people can find out about tub, or pool, rentals at www.waterbirth.org.</p>
        <p>There has been another advance on the low-tech front. In some places, squatting bars, to Ms. Simkin's delight, are coming out of the closets. At the U.C.L.A. Medical Center, Dr. DeCherney told me, ''squatting has made a comeback'' thanks to the bars over the beds, ''which allow the patient to squat and push at the same time, so the perineum's still where it should be and. . . .</p>
        <p>'' . . . and you, the doctor, are still where you are, right?'' I asked. ''At the foot of the bed, not on the floor?''</p>
        <p>''Right.''</p>
        <p>Some things never change.</p>
