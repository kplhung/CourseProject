        <p>With the easing of economic sanctions against North Korea by the Clinton administration this week, American corporations based here are beginning to assess business opportunities in a country that has been out of bounds for five decades.</p>
        <p>North Korea, a country of 22 million people, many of them deprived of all but the most basic needs, represents an unknown world for American business, but one with prospects both large and small: businessmen here see the need for everything from large transportation and energy projects to modest consumer goods.</p>
        <p>The president of the American Chamber of Commerce here, Jeffrey D. Jones, says that sketchy data indicate that North Koreans earn a wage of about $150 to $200 a month, much of it disposable income because the state provides housing and basic food. If these wage figures are correct, Mr. Jones said, they exceed disposable income in parts of post-Communist Eastern Europe. However, North Koreans who have fled to China in droves to escape famine have suggested that families are spending almost all their money on food.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Jones warned that the process of opening up North Korea would be slow, in large part because of its government's wariness about contact with outsiders.</p>
        <p>In a meeting with American business leaders, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said, without giving specifics, that Washington was eager to encourage North Korea, one of the last outposts of strict Communist economy, to move into the international commercial system.</p>
        <p>Businessmen said they envisioned North Korea developing credibility with major Western powers and then becoming eligible for funds from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.</p>
        <p>This would lay the groundwork for major infrastructure projects, which in turn would attract basic chemical, petrochemical, plastics and paints industries.</p>
        <p>Many analysts have predicted that the bare-bones North Korean economy, propped up lately by deliveries of food, fertilizer and fuel from South Korea, China, Japan and the United States, will collapse.</p>
        <p>But some modest optimism has emerged, especially since the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, visited China last month. He was urged by his Chinese allies to follow them in opening up his economy and was taken around computer companies in Beijing.</p>
        <p>Telecommunications, including mobile phones, which are becoming a promising investment sector in China, will take years to open up in North Korea, Mr. Jones said.</p>
        <p>Only 4.9 percent of households are believed to have phones in North Korea, according to South Korean statistics.</p>
        <p>A joint South-North economic committee was set up during the summit meeting of the two Korean leaders 10 days ago, and this panel is likely, in the beginning, to become the main conduit for business in the North.</p>
        <p>Some South Korean companies already do such business, but Mr. Jones, a lawyer here, cautioned that of the four ventures with North Korea that he had been involved in, only one was still going.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones quoted the head of a major South Korean corporation as suggesting that there was no need for American businesses to fret about competition: as the South Korean had said, ''If you are worried about a slice of the pie, there is no pie yet.''</p>
