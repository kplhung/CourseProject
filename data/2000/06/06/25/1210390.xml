        <p>Arkansas's Fourth Congressional District, covering the bottom third of the state, was solidly Democratic until 1992. Then along came a conservative Republican named Jay W. Dickey, and since then the Fourth has been solidly Dickey.</p>
        <p>Democrats have failed three times to come up with a challenger strong enough to take him, in good part because he is a master mender of fences back home, able to get votes from Democrats and Republicans.</p>
        <p>Still, Democrats refuse to give up, and this year, with Republicans holding only a six-seat edge in Congress, state and national Democratic leaders decided to go all out after Mr. Dickey, with the party nominating a popular, well-financed state senator, Mike Ross, to take him on. The Democratic leaders figured they had Mr. Dickey beaten after he alienated the Arkansas Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association, a major political force in the district. One poll put Mr. Ross ahead by two points.</p>
        <p>The farmers association had asked Mr. Dickey to get Congress involved in settling a lawsuit in which association members claimed the Agriculture Department had discriminated against them. He replied that it would be next to impossible to rally any Republican support for the association because it had signaled its intent to endorse a Democrat in the Fourth this year.</p>
        <p>To some Dickey detractors, that smacked of political extortion and they talked for a while of filing an ethics complaint. In the meantime, Mr. Dickey, ever the fence mender, reopened a dialogue with the association and began pressuring federal farm officials to speed the flow of loans to its members.</p>
        <p>Last Wednesday, the association threw its support to Mr. Dickey, saying: ''Jay Dickey has not just talked about supporting African-Americans and other minorities, he has done it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ross's take on that:</p>
        <p>''It's unfortunate we have the kind of congressman who has demanded political endorsements and campaign contributions before he will help.''</p>
