        <p>Enzo Gugliuzza,</p>
        <p>Williamsburg, Brooklyn,</p>
        <p>May 18, 2000</p>
        <p>''I play the trumpet on my lunch hour. A lot of guys go get pizza, but I play the trumpet. People think I'm nuts. Actually, I've always played the trumpet. But if you're not constant, you lose the sound, the essence, the spirit. What comes out is technically correct, but there's no beauty in it. So two years ago, I did the math: an hour a day, 5 hours a week, 20 hours a month -- I could do so many things with that time. I could learn French. I could do anything. Then I said, the trumpet! In the same month, a friend of mine died. We had been friends for about 10 years. I remember that she was so proud of me. She had always thought of me as a musician. I was thinking about her and kept playing to alleviate the pain that she died. Do you know Kafka? I don't like his character the cockroach. He sees the world from that point of view through a screen. At one point, I felt like that. Don't get me wrong, I really do enjoy my job. But we don't have to be buried by our duties. The trumpet is my outlet to express myself, to let the world know that I'm not a cockroach even if I wear a brown uniform.''</p>
