        <p>ASK Frank O. Braynard about airplanes and he'll reply with words like ghastly, ugly and unpleasant. Talk about cars and he'll dismiss you with a wave of his hand. ''The automobile is a passing fad,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But question Mr. Braynard about ocean liners, ask him how many smokestacks the Titanic had (four) and watch the smile crinkle through his wrinkles. Then he'll happily whisk you to his inner sanctum, a book-, file- and memorabilia-stuffed area in the heart of his Sea Cliff basement stacked with information about ships. Breathing hard -- the stairs are not easy to maneuver at age 84 -- he'll take out the framed sketch of the Leviathan that he drew in 1923.</p>
        <p>''I was able to draw the Leviathan as a 7-year-old child would, but I misspelled my own name,'' said Mr. Braynard, a maritime historian and artist. ''Which is most important? The ship of course, not my name.''</p>
        <p>Years later, he interviewed 3,000 people and wrote six encyclopedic volumes about the boat, dubbing it ''the world's greatest ship.'' Among the troops who voyaged on the liner after it was seized from Germany was a young assistant secretary of the navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>
        <p>''Ships made America; I love being involved with ships and ship people,'' Mr. Braynard said, pulling open a drawer brimming with drawings and paintings, including a poster of the Lusitania, a cutaway of the Royal Caribbean Line's Voyager of the Sea, and the Normandie.</p>
        <p>The stories of the cathedrals that cruise the seas tumble forth, enough anecdotes to fill the 37 books Mr. Braynard has written and illustrated, from his 1947 tome ''Lives of the Liners'' to two volumes in the works. Note the piles of postcard reproductions of his pen and ink sketches of ships from the Exodus to the Fire Islander ferry. Among his nautical souvenirs: a large metal ''S'' from the bow of the Stockholm. When it hit the Andrea Doria in 1956, that was the only letter that survived.</p>
        <p>In his second-floor office, Mr. Braynard is compiling sketches for a book about smokestacks. Only 11 vessels had four, his beloved Leviathan only three. The Betsy Ross, a flop of a ship, had an unusual single smokestack. He keeps 400 maritime paintings in the attic.</p>
        <p>Born in Sea Cliff, raised in Glen Cove, Mr. Braynard went to bed by the 7 o'clock ship whistles in Hempstead Harbor and traveled to his family's summer home on Martha's Vineyard by steamship.</p>
        <p>For his lifelong celebration of shipping, Mr. Braynard received an honorary doctorate from the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point during commencement exercises on Monday. But there was a time when his seafaring expertise was not enough.</p>
        <p>''I flunked my Ph.D.,'' Mr. Braynard said, recalling the two oral examinations he flubbed as a doctoral candidate in history at Columbia University. ''All I knew was ships.''</p>
        <p>The experience made him realize that shipping was his calling. He went to work for the American Merchant Marine Institute, a trade association, then got a job as a ship reporter at The New York Herald Tribune, later going into public relations.</p>
        <p>Though sailing wasn't really his area of interest, Mr. Braynard brought the parade of tall ships to New York Harbor, first in 1964, then as Operation Sail '76 in honor of the bicentennial.</p>
        <p>In 1979 he became curator of the American Merchant Marine Museum at the Merchant Marine Academy. He retired earlier this year.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Braynard and his wife, Doris, continue to ply the seas. In August, they're slated for three one-week cruises on the Disney Magic. On board, he'll lecture about ocean liners and she'll give talks on opera.</p>
        <p>Where are they going? ''I don't know,'' Mr. Braynard said. ''The Caribbean somewhere. I don't care where we go. It's the ship that counts to me.''</p>
        <p>STAR Graduates</p>
        <p>As a young adolescent, Harold Jean-Louis was terribly introverted. He was a good student, but too shy to raise his hand or give a presentation in class.</p>
        <p>Though she excelled in class, Leniece Dean had an attitude problem. When her counselor tried to speak with her, Leniece would walk away.</p>
        <p>But when they entered the ninth grade at Wyandanch Memorial High School, Harold and Leniece were offered slots in the STAR program (Success Through Academic Readiness), sponsored by the Lake Success-based Institute for Student Achievement. Like the 397 students in the academic enrichment and counseling program in the Hempstead, Roosevelt and Wyandanch schools, they were identified as at-risk youth.</p>
        <p>During the 10 hours a week they spent in the STAR classroom at their high school over the next four years, Mr. Jean-Louis, 18, and Ms. Dean, 18, received help with homework, reviewed for Regents and prepared for the SAT. They attended communications and career workshops. Counselors coached them on social skills, lauded their every achievement and helped with family issues. To broaden their horizons, the STAR pupils visited the Apollo Theater, took ski trips, ice skated in Rockefeller Center and went on college tours.</p>
        <p>Yesterday Mr. Jean-Louis, the son of Haitian immigrants who barely speak English, graduated as the valedictorian of his class. Though Wyandanch doesn't offer either advanced-placement or honors courses, when he starts Syracuse University this fall, Mr. Jean-Louis will have accumulated 21 college credits. Ms. Dean was the class salutatorian. She plans to study business administration at St. John's University in Queens.</p>
        <p>Of the 24 seniors in the STAR program at Wyandanch High, 20 plan to go to college.</p>
        <p>''In my freshman year, there were a lot of different groups I wasn't part of,'' said Mr. Jean-Louis, the first in his family to attend college. ''I was more of an observer. This program came along and I started speaking in class and giving presentations. It's made me more outspoken.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Dean said the STAR instructors made sure their students succeeded. ''If you didn't want to go to class, they walked you to class; they kept tabs on us,'' Ms. Dean said.</p>
        <p>During her final semester of high school, Ms. Dean studied fashion merchandising and design at the Lewis A. Wilson Technological Center, a vocational school in Dix Hills. After college, she plans to start a fashion design company with her best friend and fellow STAR student, Kellie Wyatt, 18.</p>
        <p>''Our area is perceived to be villainous and recalcitrant,'' Mr. Jean-Louis said, reviewing his valedictory theme. ''What we are perceived to be is not what we are. Everything they said we couldn't do, we have done. We set the precedent that we can achieve anything we set our minds to.''</p>
        <p>Top Twins</p>
        <p>Since the day they were born, each weighing 7 pounds 14 ounces, Jason and Cory Mingelgreen have done just about everything together. They share a room in their Cedarhurst home. They have the same group of friends. So it wasn't surprising when the 17-year-old identical twins split the top spots in Lawrence High School's class of 2000.</p>
        <p>''We just try to help each other,'' Jason said. ''It was a friendly competition. I tried to do better than him, but obviously I didn't come out at the top.'' Cory, the class valedictorian, finished his high school career with a 99.05 average. Jason, the salutatorian, had a 98.77.</p>
        <p>Even their rigorous schedule was almost identical: advanced-placement English, advanced-placement physics, advanced-placement government and BC calculus. They were in different advanced-placement economics sections. Jason took advanced-placement Spanish while Cory took a math projects course.</p>
        <p>Usually they did their homework together. ''It goes quicker that way,'' Cory said. ''We're definitely able to help each other. In my case, because I'm not the super all-around student, I know I wouldn't be No. 1 if it weren't for him helping me.''</p>
        <p>Jason, who was the editor in chief and sports editor of the school paper, The Mental Pabulum, said he is the better writer and linguist. Cory, who placed fourth in mathematics in the Intel competition in May, is the math and science honcho.</p>
        <p>Both work for the Five Towns Community Chest Youth Board. Both are Advanced Placement Scholars and in the National Honor Society. Both like to play basketball on their driveway. But there are differences.</p>
        <p>''He may be No. 1, but I'm older,'' said Jason, born five minutes before his brother. ''I'm taller,'' said Cory, who stands 6-foot-1, nearly two inches taller than his twin.</p>
        <p>After working this summer as cabana boys in Atlantic Beach, the Mingelgreens are going separate ways for the first time. Cory will attend Lehigh University's integrated business and engineering honors program. Jason plans to study broadcast journalism and business at Syracuse.</p>
        <p>At Lawrence High School's recent senior awards ceremony, Cory received eight awards, Jason got seven.</p>
        <p>But who's counting? ''It would have been better if I was No. 1 and he was No. 2,'' Jason said.</p>
        <p>''I disagree,'' Cory replied.</p>
