        <p>THE two-and-a-quarter-mile stretch of Dune Road that runs the length of this  village on a barrier beach facing the Atlantic in southeastern Suffolk County has the air of a gold-rush town. Dozens of houses are either being built or rebuilt. The village is rapidly regaining the 190 houses that were once lost or made uninhabitable by three decades of severe beach erosion. A $17 million publicly financed beach rebuilding project, completed in 1997, stablilized and expanded the beach and restored its dunes, leading to the current building boom.</p>
        <p>Gary A. Vegliante, the mayor of West Hampton Dunes, said that over the last 12 months, 25 houses have been completed and 40 are currently under construction. He  expects another 35 houses to be finished  over the next year. Since the village began rebuilding in 1996, 200 certificates of occupancy, including those for new houses on formerly vacant lots, have been issued, he said.</p>
        <p>The beach restoration has worked so well that a sand replenishment project, originally scheduled for last year, has been postponed until this fall.</p>
        <p>Other public officials are much less enthusiastic about the project, but whatever the view, it's generally agreed that the beach restoration has had an unexpected but positive side effect. The piping plover, an endangered migratory bird that had all but vanished from the area, has flourished since the beach was rebuilt. Thirty-three breeding pairs and 72 fledglings were counted last year.</p>
        <p>''We believe this to be a blueprint for successful coastal management because what we have clearly proven is that what used to be competing interests can come together and have a vested interest that's common to everyone's needs and goals,'' said Mr. Vegliante, who helped establish the one-and-a-half--square-mile village in 1993. The population is now about 550.</p>
        <p>''Public access to the beaches can cohabitate with private property rights,'' the mayor said. ''And something that no one believed could be done, the creation and enhancement of environmental habitat, is resulting in a piping plover population that is greater than that of Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island combined.''</p>
        <p>Sand erosion along this strip of barrier beach, which lies between the Atlantic and Moriches Bay just east of Cupsogue Beach County Park, began occurring after 1964  when the Army Corps of Engineers constructed 15 groins, also known as jetties,  east of what is now the village's eastern boundary. The groins trapped sand, keeping it from replenishing the western end of the  beach. Soon homeowners there were seeing  houses undermined by water, and storms swept many of them away.</p>
        <p>By 1995, all but 18 of the 160 oceanfront houses were lost, and most of the village's total of 250 houses had been destroyed or severely damaged. Dune Road, covered with sand, was impassable; the county park was closed.</p>
        <p>A December 1992 storm made an opening between the Atlantic and Moriches Bay just west of the last groin, creating an island.  The gap quickly widened to 3,000 feet, threatening the ecology of the brackish Moriches Bay, covering 5,000 acres, by allowing in greater amounts of salt water. Had the remaining barrier beach west of the breach been eaten away, the heavily populated areas north of the bay would have become much more vulnerable to flooding from storms. It cost $8.8 million to close the breach, a project federal, state and local officials undertook late in 1993.</p>
        <p>But it was a lawsuit by owners who had lost their houses to reach a settlement that led to the beach restoration project. The first lawsuit, against Suffolk County, was filed in 1984 by property owners who had formed the Barrier Beach Preservation Association. The suit was later expanded to include the federal and state governments. The homeowners contended that the erosion project begun in 1964 -- and financed by all three governments -- caused the loss of their homes. Represented by John J. O'Connell, a Manhattan lawyer, the owners sought $200 million in damages.</p>
        <p>In a 1994 settlement, the three defendants  agreed to restore the beach and dunes and to maintain them for 30 years by replenishing any sand that might be lost to erosion. To allow public access to the ocean and bay  while protecting the dunes, 11 wooden walkways were to be built, and so far, nine have been completed.</p>
        <p>The federal government is paying 70 percent of the restoration costs, New York State 21 percent and Suffolk County 9 percent. The total cost is now estimated at $50 million -- about two-thirds the original estimate -- by the time the project ends in 2027.</p>
        <p>David and Carol Zolondek have reconstructed their oceanfront house. ''We built our house in 1980, it was washed away in 1993, and we rebuilt in 1998,'' said Mr. Zolondek, who owns a textile export company in Manhattan. ''When you watch the beach deteriorating, and houses wash away,  and your neighbors suffering, it's not pleasant because it was such a nice community that we had,'' he said. ''And now to see people rebuilding their houses and putting money into them, and families with children coming back, it's a renewal.''</p>
        <p>Under the settlement agreement, owners  had to make some concessions. For lots on the south side of Dune Road, the owners had to agree to deed to Suffolk County everything on the ocean side of the new dunes (''south of the seaward toe of the new dunes'' is the official wording). The dunes, although owned by the individuals whose property they are on, were designated a conservation area, and they can be crossed only by wooden walkways that individual homeowners must build.</p>
        <p>Owners of oceanfront lots have only 50 feet, measured northward from the dunes,  within which to construct a house, because they must allow for a 25-foot setback from Dune Road. In addition, all houses must stand on stilts that are a minimum of 12 feet high. (Under the village building code the  house itself cannot be higher than 32 feet above the platform's lowest beam.)</p>
        <p>BUILDING is prohibited in parts of the bay side of Dune Road between April 1 and Sept. 1, the nesting season of the piping plover. Construction has to stop anywhere in the village if a nest is discovered near the building site.</p>
        <p>Despite the restrictions, land prices have soared over the last three years, and West Hampton Dunes, once characterized by modest beach houses, is moving upscale. A 60-foot wide oceanfront lot sold for $70,000 five years ago, said Christopher Foglio, a sales agent with the Coldwell Banker brokerage company in Westhampton. Now the same size lot is selling for $400,000, he said.</p>
        <p>Legacy Development USA of Hauppauge, which has 21 houses either completed or under construction, has sold all but four.  Asking prices for the unsold houses, two on the ocean, are $880,000 to $1.35 million. Citi Habitats in Manhattan is the sales agent.</p>
        <p>Ed Heiberger, the president of Legacy, said that oceanfront houses like the 2,900-square-foot traditional house, with five bedrooms, four and a half baths and a guest suite, that he sold a year ago for $883,000 are fetching $1.3 million today. The reason, he said, is that people are gaining confidence that the beach is no longer endangered.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heiberger said he became aware of building opportunities in West Hampton Dunes after his son Andrew, who is president of Citi Habitats, saw an oceanfront lot advertised for $175,000 at the end of 1997.</p>
        <p>''I came out here to take a look,'' Ed Heiberger said, ''and said: 'This is just beautiful. What's happening here?' ''</p>
        <p>Legacy builds a mix of Victorian, Mediterranean and what it calls Plantation and Island Beach houses. The $1.1 million Mediterranean under construction on the ocean is fairly typical: it has a pool and three of the four bedrooms and a den are on the first floor. The living areas and master bedroom  are on the second floor, which offers the best views.</p>
        <p>Another large builder active in the area is Island Estates of Ronkonkoma. It has two houses under construction. A five-bedroom oceanfront house on a 75-foot-wide lot with a pool is priced at $1.250 million. The other on Moriches Bay on a 60-by-600-foot lot, also with five bedrooms and a pool, is priced at $999,000. The company has yet to build on 12 other lots it owns along Dune Road, said Rudy Princi, one of the principals.</p>
        <p>While some public officials call West Hampton Dunes a success story, others contend that the restoration was a waste of  taxpayer dollars and that a better settlement of the lawsuit could have been reached. They say that public money should not have been used to stabilize the beach so that private owners of oceanfront lots could build, allowing erosion problems to start once again. These critics contend that the lots should have been bought up and made part of the public beach.</p>
        <p>The issue is now being debated anew as a similar beach restoration project is being considered farther west, along the 32-mile length of Fire Island.</p>
        <p>''I am a supporter of the notion of a new dune and pumping sand onto the beach and trying to stabilize the flow of sediment from east to west, but not to build houses on it,'' said Stephen M. Jones, Suffolk County's planning director. ''I feel terrible about  what is happening at West Hampton Dunes.  To stabilize the shoreline and then build houses on the beach is a real perversion of public policy.''</p>
        <p>But others say it is only fair that if houses were lost because of government action, then homeowners should be allowed to keep their property and rebuild.</p>
        <p>Jane Ekstein, the executive director of Save Our Seashore, a nonprofit group formed in 1992 to lobby for the preservation and protection of coastal resources from Montauk to Coney Island, pointed out that protecting the coastline safeguards the property, businesses and well-being of the  people living on the South Shore. Millions benefit from the recreation that beaches provide, she added.</p>
        <p>''This is not about creating building lots,'' she said. ''This is about developing the common goal of saving a fabulous resource and understanding that to do so, everyone must work together.''</p>
