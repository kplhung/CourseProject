        <p>HOLLYWOOD hasn't come up with many movies that are sophisticated, political, heart-warming and life-affirming at the same time. But Morton DaCosta's AUNTIE MAME (1958) is all those things, and it makes single parenthood look great. Sure, there's the musical version of Patrick Dennis's story about the eccentric Beekman Place aunt who reared him in the 1920's and 30's, but who needs singing and dancing when you have the incomparable Rosalind Russell as Mame? Peggy Cass is adorable, too, as Agnes Gooch, the mousy secretary who takes Mame's advice (to get out there and live life) a little too much to heart - Saturday at 12:30 p.m. on TCM.</p>

        <p>Everything that was magical about Jim Henson and the world of puppetry that he created shines bright in THE MUPPET MOVIE (1979). It's a musical about how Kermit the Frog met the other Muppets and they all went to Hollywood to become famous and fulfill their destiny: making people happy. It was on that fateful cross-country drive that Kermit first saw Miss Piggy, winning the Bogen County Beauty Pageant. And talk about big-time stars doing cameos: Bob Hope, Milton Berle, Orson Welles and Edgar Bergen among them - Sunday at 5 p.m., Thursday at 9 p.m. and Friday at 2 p.m. on Odyseey.</p>
        <p>You may have seen some fine Cryanos on stage and screen in your time, but Jean-Paul Rappeneau's CYRANO DE BERGERAC (1990), with Gerard Depardieu, has to be one of the best. Mr. Depardieu plays the title character's finest qualities to the hilt. He's a charming, supremely confident raconteur who can defeat a smart-aleck in a duel while composing and reciting poetry. Were it not for his one unfortunate facial feature (''My nose precedes me by 15 minutes''), surely his beautiful cousin Rosane (Anne Brochet) would love him. Instead he helps the handsome, tongue-tied, self-declared ''brainless fool'' Christian (Vincent Perez) win her. Cyrano's has awlays been a French story, of course, but in this version the joie de vivre is particularly robust. Especially when Rosane turns up in a battle zone with a chef and a coach full of fine food and wine - Sunday at 2 p.m. on Sunday/Early Monday at 3 a.m. on Bravo.</p>
        <p>A grimmer vision of the battlefield is at the heart of Edward Zwick's GLORY (1989), a beautifully played Civil War drama about a valiant all-black fighting unit and the price of human dignity. The film, which includes one of the most poignant final images ever put on screen, made Denel Washington a star (and an Oscar winner) as a hot-tempered young soldier who turns his anger into courage. Matthew Broderick is also outstanding - and perfectly cast - as the company's baby-faced white commanding officer who develops maturity and nobility beyond his years - Saturday at 11:30 p.m. on Channel 11.</p>
        <p>Not long ago the alcoholic-on-a-self-destructive-binge scenario seemed like a story done once too often. Then Mike Figgis made LEAVING LAS VEGAS (1995). Nicolas Cage earned the best actor Oscar for his role as a former Hollywood hotshot who, having lost his job and his family, decides to commit suicide, slowly and passionately, by drinking himself to death in Nevada. Elisabth Shue is sympathetic as the prostitute who comes to love him. It's searing drama, reflecting on a particularly tough question: How do you behave when you can truly say that nothing matters anymore? - Sunday at 8 and 10 p.m. on TNT.</p>
