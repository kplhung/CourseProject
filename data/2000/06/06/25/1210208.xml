        <p>The Lower East Side Historic District, the largest of the three, was honored as the toehold in the New World for waves of working-class immigrants from Germany and Eastern Europe.

The L-shape district runs between Allen and Essex Streets from Houston and Canal Streets, and extends five blocks west along East Broadway.</p>

        <p>Three city neighborhoods that flourished between the middle of the 19th and early 20th centuries were added to New York State's registry of historic places this month.</p>
        <p>The Lower East Side Historic District, the largest of the three, was honored as the toehold in the New World for waves of working-class immigrants from Germany and Eastern Europe. It contains 508 buildings, including many tenements built between 1860 and 1900. The L-shape district runs between Allen and Essex Streets from Houston and Canal Streets, and extends five blocks west along East Broadway.</p>
        <p>The second-largest, the area known as Dumbo (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass), was recognized as Brooklyn's cradle of manufacturing. The 24-block district has about 90 factories, many erected around the turn of the 20th century, that once housed leading makers of steel wool, machinery, corrugated boxes, soap and sugar.</p>
        <p>And Douglaston Hill, a stately neighborhood in northeastern Queens near Little Neck Bay, was designated as a prototype of the commuter suburb. The four-block district contains 90 properties, including many Queen Anne, Colonial Revival and Tudor-style homes that were built in the years between 1900 and 1910.</p>
        <p>''These are three great examples of places with historical and architectural value,'' said Randall Sawyer, a spokesman for the Office of Parks, Recreation and Development. The designations were issued June 9.</p>
        <p>The nominations have been forwarded to the National Registry of Historic Places, which typically follows the state's lead, said Vicki Weiner, executive director of the Historic Districts Council, a preservation group.</p>
        <p>Although the designations are largely honorific, the government provides tax credits for preservation work. ''It encourages proper stewardship of the buildings,'' Ms. Weiner said.</p>
