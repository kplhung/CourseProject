        <p>TALK to any of the newly named Jandon Scholars, and the word resilience comes to mind. Battling financial and family problems, these students struggled to maintain their grades, their equilibrium and their dreams of a college education.</p>
        <p>The first 12 recipients of the new scholarships, which recognize academic achievement among low-income high school students, will head to college this fall. The students, from public high schools in Westchester, will each receive $10,000 over four years to help pay tuition.</p>
        <p>The program is financed by the Jandon Foundation, a private family foundation started by Jane and Donald Cecil of Harrison. Mr. Cecil is a co-founder of Cumberland Associates, an investment firm in Manhattan. The County Social Services Department identified promising students whose families were living below the poverty level. Scholarship recipients were then selected by an academic panel, which considered the students' grades, Scholastic Achievement Test scores and character. Here are some of their stories:</p>
        <p>Neelam Gidwaney</p>
        <p>Neelam Gidwaney still remembers her father's beautiful hair. But that image is soon replaced with those of his illness -- epileptic convulsions, wheelchairs and partial paralysis. Neelam's father, who became ill with a brain tumor when she was in second grade, died a month before her 16th birthday.</p>
        <p>''He was sick for most of my childhood,'' Neelam said. ''I have a vivid memory of my mom helping him out of the shower and seeing for the first time that he had no hair. I was just shocked. I kept thinking, ''What's going on with my dad?'''</p>
        <p>To protect Neelam, her family held back the truth of her father's diagnosis, even telling her once: ''Daddy is like tarnished silver. The doctors will polish him up and make him shiny again.''</p>
        <p>But the reality of her father's illness colored her childhood. Medical and financial crises were constant, and Neelam began working in fifth grade. She earned money in elementary school by baby-sitting. By high school she had held jobs as a lifeguard, a cashier, a pharmacist's assistant and a restaurant hostess.</p>
        <p>Despite all the pressures, Neelam maintained an outstanding academic record at Dobbs Ferry High School, with a 3.8 grade point average in advanced placement courses, National Honor Society membership and many achievement awards.</p>
        <p>This fall she will attend SUNY Binghamton, where she has been accepted into a combined college and medical degree program. After completing four undergraduate years, she is guaranteed admission at Syracuse Medical School.</p>
        <p>Becoming a doctor has been a dream since childhood. ''When my father was diagnosed with cancer it was hard for me to accept it,'' she said. ''And no one would take the time to explain it to us. Part of my wanting to be a doctor is that I wanted the peace of mind of knowing what really happened and why it happened. Even young children have a right to know.''</p>
        <p>Kelly Marie Jones</p>
        <p>In her school's production of ''Peter Pan,'' Kelly Jones played one of the lost children. It was poignantly fitting. When Kelly was 15, her mother left home, taking most of the family's possessions and leaving behind a note saying she not be back.</p>
        <p>Kelly's father, who was estranged from her mother, then tried to prove that he was not her father. DNA tests proved that he was, and he had to continue paying child support.</p>
        <p>Yet throughout this trauma, Kelly maintained her 94.5 average at Peekskill High School. She played on a number of sports and performed in musicals. This fall, she will attend SUNY Oneota.</p>
        <p>''I just knew I had to make my life better,'' Kelly said. ''I wanted to be stronger than my mom, and I had to overcome what had happened.''</p>
        <p>Kelly said the support of teachers and good friends helped see her through difficult times. She and her three younger siblings live with her grandparents, who receive assistance from Social Services. Kelly works at Macy's about 20 hours a week. After college, she hopes to pursue a master's degree and a doctorate. Her dream is to become a high school social studies teacher.</p>
        <p>''I realize I have many goals in life, and that it's going to take a lot of hard work, but I feel I'm ready for the challenge,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Deyci Rodriguez</p>
        <p>Deyci Rodriguez came to this country from the Dominican Republic when she was 5. She learned English quickly, became an honors student and was active in school sports. Both her parents held skilled jobs, and they lived in a big house in Sleepy Hollow.</p>
        <p>But life began to change for Decyi in her teens. First, her father became ill and could no longer work. Shortly after that, Deyci's mother injured her back and had to leave her job as a nurse. The family moved to an apartment and began to receive public assistance.</p>
        <p>For Deyci, there was no more time for cross country, track or softball. She had always held some kind of job while attending school, but now she works 30 hours a week. She returns home from her job as a cashier at 10:30 p.m. and then begins her homework, sometimes working until 2 or 3 a.m. to finish her studies.</p>
        <p>Through it all, she has maintained a grade point average of over 94.  This fall she will attend New York University. She is interested in a business career and hopes one day to own her own accounting business.</p>
        <p>As a Hispanic, Deyci said she had often been told that women were not as strong or intelligent as men. Deyci said her inspiration has always been her mother. Mrs. Rodriguez, who grew up in a poor village in the Dominican Republic, completed college and got her nursing degree.</p>
        <p>''My mother has raised me to be a strong, independent young woman,'' Deyci said. ''There no longer is a question of my success. I will succeed -- the question now is when and where.''</p>
