        <p>The white marble walls and unbroken windows of the Essex County Courthouse gleam, the product of a $30 million restoration project that was begun in 1995 and scheduled for completion in 2004.</p>
        <p>The historic courthouse here is one of Essex County's grandest structures, a neo-Classical style temple of justice on a hill overlooking the heart of this city.</p>
        <p>Yet spreading out from the base of its marble columns, the grounds around the courthouse were overgrown and garbage-strewn. Weeds sprouted up through the crannies in the otherwise grand staircase, and in spots the grass rose four feet. Piles of dried leaves were mixed with candy wrappers, soda cans, beer bottles, coffee cups and yellowed newspapers, enclosed like a giant wastebasket by a 10-foot-high chain link fence surrounding the courthouse and an adjacent traffic island.</p>
        <p>Incongruously, officials said the splendor inside the building -- in the middle of downtown Newark -- was the cause of the squalor outside.</p>
        <p>''When that building was no longer a working county facility, it seems that the contract for the exterior maintenance was not continued,'' said Joanna Noonan, a spokeswoman for County Executive James W. Treffinger. ''The fact that there are not lawyers and judges coming and going from that building every day, it just has not come to our attention.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Noonan said maintenance of the courthouse grounds probably stopped in the summer of 1997, when scaffolding was erected around the building to clean its marble exterior. She said the scaffolding was removed at the end of last year.</p>
        <p>After inquiries were made about the condition of the grounds last week, crews of inmates from the Essex County Jail were dispatched to clean up the site.</p>
        <p>Michael Mills, a partner at Ford Farewell Mills and Gatsch, Archtects, the Princeton firm heading the team working on the courthouse restoration, said he was dismayed to hear of the site's overgrown condition. But Mr. Mills, whose firm received the lion's share of $1.9 million in design fees for the project, said that groundskeeping was not the firm's responsibility.</p>
        <p>He said most of the drafting was done in its Princeton offices, and that he had not been to the courthouse in some time.</p>
        <p>Few people would dispute that the courthouse, completed in 1906 at a cost of $2 million -- then a staggering amount -- should be preserved. It was designed by Cass Gilbert, whose credits included the United States Supreme Court building in Washington, and it is on the New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places. While some aging, even historic county jails have been demolished in recent years, Freeholder boards have generally preserved historic courthouses, which tend to occupy prominent locations in the county seat -- often in the shadow of a larger, boxier courthouse complex built to accommodate ever-expanding dockets.</p>
        <p>''It's sad,'' said Shonidah Sheppard, 19, a biology major at Essex County College, who lives nearby. ''It makes me feel like, for this environment, the people aren't appreciated.''</p>
        <p>She and several other passersby were unaware of the long-running restoration project. And a sign explaining it, which is required by the New Jersey Historic Trust as a provision of a $2 million grant, had toppled over, face down, before being removed as part of last week's cleanup.</p>
        <p>Lucy Marino of Millburn, who went back to school as an adult to study business administration at the county college, said the mess around the historic courthouse was hardly the kind of example the county should set for its citizens. ''They are supposed to show the people how to behave,'' Ms. Marino said.</p>
