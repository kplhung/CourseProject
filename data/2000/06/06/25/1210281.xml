        <p>Retailing concepts that spread quickly across the country often come from places like Georgia (Home Depot) or Arkansas (Wal-Mart Stores).</p>
        <p>But Mati Weiderpass, a veteran of the Swatch watchmaking company, and Ian Reisner, a Wall Street executive, started in Manhattan's SoHo with just a single Watch World store six years ago.</p>
        <p>They grew to 119 stores, selling casual and inexpensive watches. They also gained a rival: Watch Station, owned by Sunglass Hut, of Coral Gables, Fla.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, Mr. Weiderpass and Mr. Reisner sold their chain to Sunglass Hut for $30 million.</p>
        <p>''We didn't want to sell until the timing was right,'' said Mr. Weiderpass.</p>
        <p>They plan to stay in New York, as a couple, while they hunt for their next marketable idea.</p>
