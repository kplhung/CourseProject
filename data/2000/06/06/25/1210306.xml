        <p>The benefit of mortgaging our future to reap a minor gain today escapes me. The rate cut was financed by floating a bond whose principal and interest will be repaid by all New York State taxpayers.

        <p>The benefit of mortgaging our future to reap a minor gain today escapes me. The rate cut was financed by floating a bond whose principal and interest will be repaid by all New York State taxpayers. Lilco's Shoreham financial folly lives on, now subsidized by innocents throughout the state who have never even heard of Shoreham, while Lilco/LIPA managers and stockholders continue to escape from their mischief unscathed.</p>
        <p>Another prime example of borrow now, spend now, pay later, this one with the insidious economic three-card monte of lower current electricity rates.</p>
        <p>The denial of the economic reality that our total cost must by necessity be greater diminishes the credibility of academic economists and reinforces the obvious: that the lower rates are nothing more than sugar coating intending to make the situation more palatable for politically expedient purposes.</p>
        <p>Sorry, Mr. Pataki, Dr. Kellner, Mr. Kessel, et al., but many of us can see through your transparent machinations and we do not agree that the penny saved today makes up for the dollar to be spent tomorrow.</p>
