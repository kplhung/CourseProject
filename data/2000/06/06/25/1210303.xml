        <p>The Appellate Division in Brooklyn has upheld a ruling by the State Supreme Court Justice John S. Lockman of Nassau County ordering a former operator of a Mobil gas station in Bay Shore to pay attorney's fees as well as cleanup costs in a 1999 case involving contamination from leaking underground storage tanks.</p>
        <p>The plaintiff, the estate of Ann Malin, the owner of the gas station property, paid $500,000 to clean up the spill under an order from the state. After the cleanup the owner sued Mobil and the operator, the Bill Wolf Petroleum Corporation, for the cleanup costs.</p>

        <p>The Appellate Division in Brooklyn has upheld a ruling by the State Supreme Court Justice John S. Lockman of Nassau County ordering a former operator of a Mobil gas station in Bay Shore to pay attorney's fees as well as cleanup costs in a 1999 case involving contamination from leaking underground storage tanks.</p>
        <p>The plaintiff, the estate of Ann Malin, the owner of the gas station property, paid $500,000 to clean up the spill under an order from the state. After the cleanup the owner sued Mobil and the operator, the Bill Wolf Petroleum Corporation, for the cleanup costs.</p>
        <p>In a ruling earlier this month, the appellate justices upheld the lower court finding that the owners were entitled to recover lawyers' fees.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Debra L. Rothberg, of Manhattan, said ''turned the table on defendants in cases of property owners and others suing to recover damages from petroleum spills.''</p>
        <p>She said the ruling was a departure from a court system where all parties normally paid their own legal expenses.</p>
        <p>The lawyer for the operators, Steven H. Gaines, of Pirro Collier Cohen &amp; Halpern in White Plains, did not respond to a message left with his secretary.</p>
        <p>The case will return to Nassau County for a determination on the amount of the legal fees owed.</p>
