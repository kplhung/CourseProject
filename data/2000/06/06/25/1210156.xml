        <p>Bruce B. Berger, a lawyer who worked on the four-year investigation of New York City's private carting industry, has been named executive director of the Westchester Solid Waste Commission. His job will be to enforce Westchester's new trash haulers' law, which requires all carters to undergo a background investigation before obtaining a county license. Mr. Berger said that he wants to make sure there is fair competition in the industry and that customers will not be overcharged. A resident of White Plains, he will be paid $109,730. He takes over for Roger Rokicki, who resigned last month.</p>
