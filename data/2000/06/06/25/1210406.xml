        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Losing Ground Against Microbes'' (editorial, June 18) rightly highlights the World Health Organization's concern about the illusion that merely having a drug is equivalent to curing a disease.</p>
        <p>Part of the crisis is medicine's appalling lack of attention to the behavioral side of the health equation, the side that asks questions like: Who goes to the doctor; who prescribes which pills under what conditions and with what instructions; who is prescribed medicine and what the patients understand about its effects; why patients do or don't fill the prescription or, if they do, why they don't actually take the medicine.</p>

        <p>''Losing Ground Against Microbes'' (editorial, June 18) rightly highlights the World Health Organization's concern about the illusion that merely having a drug is equivalent to curing a disease.</p>
        <p>Part of the crisis is medicine's appalling lack of attention to the behavioral side of the health equation, the side that asks questions like: Who goes to the doctor; who prescribes which pills under what conditions and with what instructions; who is prescribed medicine and what the patients understand about its effects; why patients do or don't fill the prescription or, if they do, why they don't actually take the medicine.</p>
        <p>These questions potentially affect more people than rogue microbes but receive negligible interest from scientists and even less research support.</p>
