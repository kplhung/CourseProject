        <p>The Travel section receives hundreds of letters from readers about their experiences with airline travel. Although most write to complain, a small number actually offer words of praise. Here is a selection from the last year:</p>
        <p>To the Editor: My father died on Jan. 16. I called American Airlines that day and, using my credit card, made a reservation to fly from Kennedy Airport to Los Angeles International the following morning. The tickets were electronic. When I arrived at Kennedy, I checked my bags and received a boarding pass by showing identification.</p>

        <p>The Travel section receives hundreds of letters from readers about their experiences with airline travel. Although most write to complain, a small number actually offer words of praise. Here is a selection from the last year:</p>
        <p>To the Editor: My father died on Jan. 16. I called American Airlines that day and, using my credit card, made a reservation to fly from Kennedy Airport to Los Angeles International the following morning. The tickets were electronic. When I arrived at Kennedy, I checked my bags and received a boarding pass by showing identification.</p>
        <p>I expected my return flight on Feb. 5 to be equally simple. The gate personnel insisted, however, that I should have a paper ticket because their computer indicated that the return-flight ticket had been printed. From Gate 48B, at the furthermost end of the terminal, I was told to go to the ticket desk in the very front. I nearly missed my flight.</p>
        <p>The cause of this unpleasant incident in Los Angeles was apparent when I looked at my accumulated mail. Postmarked Jan. 29, my return-flight ticket had been mailed to my home. On two occasions in California, I called American Airlines: once to cancel my original return flight and once to reschedule it. Both times I referred to my ticket as being ''purely electronic'' and I was not contradicted.</p>
        <p>ANITA SOROKIN  South Salem, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Dale E. Morris, corporate communications manager of American Airlines, replies: We incorrectly printed the return portion of the electronic ticket. We have procedures regarding duplicate tickets, but these should not have inconvenienced Ms. Sorokin. We are extremely sorry Ms. Sorokin had this experience and that we didn't communicate with her in a timely fashion. We have sent her an apology and a transportation voucher in hopes she will give us another opportunity.</p>
