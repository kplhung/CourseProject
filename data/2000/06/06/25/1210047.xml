        <p>For some people, a few dollars a month can make the difference in buying a home or not. Neighborhood Housing Services, which works to stabilize poorer communities, has devised a program that eliminates a first-time buyer's mortgage insurance premiums.</p>
        <p>''With our customers, $50 a month can make the difference,'' said Karen Trella, Neighborhood Housing Service's deputy executive director. Participants in the program must have annual incomes below $86,000.</p>
        <p>To illustrate the way the program works, George Mensah, the organization's director of lending, said: ''If you buy a house for $100,000, under a traditional mortgage you will need to put down at least $3,000 and the bank will finance $97,000. At today's rates, the monthly payment for a 30-year mortgage will be about $746. But then, in addition, you will have to pay for private mortgage insurance at about $60 a month,'' because the down payment is less than 20 percent.</p>
        <p>With assistance from Neighborhood Housing Services, however, Mr. Mensah said, ''You still pay the $3,000 down payment, but you only get $80,000 from the bank,'' the equivalent of putting 20 percent down. That translates into $615 a month. Then, with our H.A.P. program, you get a second mortgage to cover the $17,000 difference, but the payment on that is only $143. So the total will be $758'' -- a savings of $48.</p>
