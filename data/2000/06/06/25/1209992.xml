        <p>I met a man who does research for large organizations at a library that allows you to request 12 periodicals a day. To circumvent this rule, he pays Russian immigrants a few dollars to submit his requests in their names, violating the spirit of the regulations and the minimum-wage laws. What is my ethical obligation to the immigrants, who must need the money? -- Michael Hoke, Washington</p>
        <p>To cheat a library, that noble institution of democracy, and exploit poor immigrants are indeed unethical acts, but are you certain this is happening? If those Russians are his research assistants, their requests are as legitimate as anyone's. And do you really know their pay scale?</p>

        <p>I met a man who does research for large organizations at a library that allows you to request 12 periodicals a day. To circumvent this rule, he pays Russian immigrants a few dollars to submit his requests in their names, violating the spirit of the regulations and the minimum-wage laws. What is my ethical obligation to the immigrants, who must need the money? -- Michael Hoke, Washington</p>
        <p>To cheat a library, that noble institution of democracy, and exploit poor immigrants are indeed unethical acts, but are you certain this is happening? If those Russians are his research assistants, their requests are as legitimate as anyone's. And do you really know their pay scale?</p>
        <p>If your suspicions can be confirmed, you should tell the immigrants about the minimum-wage laws and the librarian about the request-slip laundering. The library can decide if the Russians are inconveniencing other patrons; the immigrants can think about pushing for a raise. I'd hold off on calling the cops.</p>
        <p>Some researchers have had it worse. In George Gissing's 1891 novel, ''New Grub Street,'' Marian Yule describes her job: ''The readers who sat here at the radiating desks, what were they but hapless flies caught in a huge web, its nucleus the great circle of the Catalogue. Darker, darker. From the tower wall of volumes seemed to emanate visible motes, intensifying the obscurity; in a moment the book-lined circumference of the room would be but a featureless prison-limit.''</p>
        <p>If you spot anything like that, then call 911.</p>
        <p>Out to dinner, my wife and I became helplessly distracted by blaring radio commercials. I had noticed the tuner in the back on my way to the restroom, so I took the liberty of changing the station to a commercial-free channel. My wife thinks I should have asked someone who worked at the restaurant to change the station rather than take matters into my own hands, but I think it was simpler and faster just to do it myself. What do you think? -- Matthew Johnson, Andice, Tex.</p>
        <p>Your dispute seems more about etiquette than ethics, and it is one in which I side with your wife. You're certainly free to ask the restaurant manager to turn the radio down, or off, or to be switched to another station, but you have no right to impose your own taste on your fellow diners. Similarly, if the color of the walls offends you, you may complain, but you may not pull out a roller and a dropcloth and start redecorating. Someone else's restaurant; someone else's call.</p>
        <p>While it may indeed be simpler and faster to take matters -- and the radio dial -- into your own hands, that's not much of a defense. If an action is inapt, performing it more swiftly does not augment its benevolence. I'm just as reluctant to be robbed by a fast thief as by a dawdler.</p>
        <p>A restaurant's running commercial radio (or even those ''Car Talk'' guys) may be annoying, but it is not unethical. Short of cranking up the volume high enough to make your ears bleed, the restaurant is free to pollute the audio environment any way it likes. Because something is unpleasant needn't mean it is unethical.</p>
        <p>That said, while your pre-emptive strike on the radio dial is impolite, it is not particularly unethical. You harmed no one, and should they desire it, the restaurateurs can easily switch back to all-commercials, all-the-time radio. However, you may want to reconsider the wisdom of offending the people who are about to prepare your food.</p>
