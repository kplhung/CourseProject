        <p>PARENTS and doctors have long assumed that young children who suffer from repeated middle-ear infections are at high risk of developing speech and language problems. But new research suggests that such concerns are overblown, if not groundless - that there is little or no association between the number and severity of ear infections in the first three years of life and language abilities in preschool and beyond.</p>
        <p>''Parents should be reassured,'' said Dr. Jack L. Paradise, a professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh who is the lead author of a study in the May issue of the Journal Pediatrics.</p>
        <p>Studying children from infancy until age 3, Dr. Paradise looked at the effects of fluid in the middle ear, a problem that often accompanies middle-ear infections can impair a child's hearing. Of the 241 children in the study, some had never had fluid in their ears, while others had had it for as much as 45 percent of their lives. At age 3, the children had their language skills tested.</p>
        <p>The amount of time children spent with middle-ear fluid had no bearing on their ''productive'' language scores, meaning how well adn how much they spoke. There was a modest correlation with ''receptive'' language - how much the children understood when someone spoke to them - but the variances in the scores were just 1 percent to 3 percent.</p>
        <p>Casting further doubt on the relationship between ear infections and language development are new data from Dr. Paradise's study, presented in Boston last month at a meeting of the Pediatric Academic Societies. The data were on the most extreme cases - 402 infants and toddlers who had had middle-ear fluid for at least 90 days straight or intermittently for longer periods. Those children were randomly assigned to have tubes surgically inserted into their ears to treat the problem immediately or six to nine months later. The children who had the surgery immediately did not better on language tests at age 3 than did the other children.</p>
        <p>Hearing loss associated with middle-ear fluid is temporary; permanent hearing loss is another matter. About 1 to 2 children in 1,000 have a severe hearing impairment, including permanent sensorineural hearing loss, which is caused by a problem in the inner ear. Unless it is correctly early with hearing aids, such loss can lead to profound difficulties with speech and language. Twenty-nine states, including New York, require hearing screening tests for newborns. Experts also recommend that children have regular screenings.
