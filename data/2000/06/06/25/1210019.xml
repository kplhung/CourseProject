        <p>Priceline.com, which lets people propose online the price they will pay for air fares, hotel rooms, groceries and other services, this month added two car rental companies, Hertz and Alamo, to its vendors. In November, the Budget and National chains began renting cars through Priceline.com. The four companies have about 70 percent of the domestic car rental business at airports.</p>
        <p>Within an hour of filling out the online bidding form, customers are notified by e-mail if their bid is accepted. Vehicles are available only at airports, and bidders do not choose which company supplies the car. They can select any type of passenger vehicle, all of which come with unlimited mileage.</p>
        <p>Priceline.com said its vendors are renting cars at 100 locations and adding more each week. It said that by the end of March, it was processing 20,000 vehicle-days of car rentals each week.</p>
        <p>Bidders will get the best deals on days, and in places, where the rental companies have excess vehicles in their parking lots. If a bid is accepted, there is a fee of $5 a rental. In addition, customers pay normal rental taxes, which are disclosed in advance at the bidding site. The Web site, www.priceline .com, accepts bids from drivers 18 and older.</p>
