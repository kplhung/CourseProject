        <p>LAST week at Saks Fifth Avenue, Craig Natiello, who designs for the Halston label, was showing his fall collection to a circle of his faithful -- young society figures, including Tara Rockefeller and Somers White. He paused to note that most truly chic women know how to dramatize their assets. To reinforce the point, he pulled back his hair, tilted his chin skyward and pursed his lips in a dowager pout, the image of Diana Vreeland.</p>
        <p>Mr. Natiello's talent for impersonation has served him well. For a decade, he worked for Bill Blass, rising to the position of senior designer. He cultivated Mr. Blass's deft way with a pair of shears, his polished manner and, not least, his personal touch with well-bred clients.</p>
        <p>Bent on entertaining young plutocrats like Nathalie Gerschel-Kaplan, Marina Rust, Jennifer Creel and Brooke de Ocampo in what he considered the Blass tradition, Mr. Natiello draped them, regaled them with gossip and squired them to as many dinners and galas as his calendar would hold.</p>
        <p>Last December, he parlayed his creative talent and position as smooth-talking escort to the young East Side crowd into a coveted appointment as chief designer for Halston, a post some people think will seal his status as designer of the hour.</p>
        <p>''There's been a lot of good buzz about him -- he's the next big thing,'' said Cristina Greeven, the publisher and editor of Manhattan File, a magazine that chronicles the doings of young celebrities and socialites. Comparing him to competitors like Michael Kors, another designer with an upper-crust following, she added, ''Craig is in that phase of carving out a niche in which social connections are superimportant.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Natiello has invoked a tradition that dates to the days of Mainbocher, couturier to the Duchess of Windsor, and recalls legendary fashion partnerships like those of Jacqueline Kennedy and Oleg Cassini, Audrey Hepburn and Hubert de Givenchy, Mr. Blass and Babe Paley. It is a specialty role in the world of fashion, to be sure. Most successful designers -- Tom Ford of Gucci, Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger -- did not get that way by cultivating a social elite little known to the world. They did it by marketing. When they do forge a bond with a customer, it is likely to be a rock star or Oscar nominee, who will parade their wares before the world.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Natiello arrives at a time when Park Avenue chic is stronger than it has been in a generation -- when ''ladylike'' dressing has been decreed the freshest thing and women under 35 are reviving society weddings, balls and other rituals long thought irrelevant.</p>
        <p>''I guess you could say we grew up together,'' Mr. Natiello said of his friendships with Ms. de Ocampo, Ms. Rust, Kim Hersov and Lillian Wang von Stauffenberg, all of whom he met while he worked for Mr. Blass and they toiled as junior editors at Elle and Vogue.</p>
        <p>His bonds with junior society, in fact, are what gave him the edge over other candidates when the owners of Halston parted with the label's previous designer, Kevan Hall, and looked for a replacement. ''We hired Craig not only because of his talent but because of his knowledge of the couture customer,'' said Nicholas J. DeMarco, Halston's chief executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Natiello's connections are an asset for a company intent on resurrecting Halston as a luxury brand and purveyor of simple but glamorous evening wear and, beginning next spring, of high-end daytime clothes, men's clothing and accessories.</p>
        <p>At a dinner Mr. Natiello gave last week at Swifty's, the gathering place of the former Mortimer's crowd, Laura Henson, the label's public relations director, was quick to take up the company line. Looking around the table crowded with his friends like Andrew and Jill Roosevelt and James and Whitney Fairchld, she mused: ''What did they say about Halston? He traveled in the circles of the women he dressed. Craig is like that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Natiello would certainly like you to think so, although he perhaps overstates his entree into this world. During the American Fashion Awards this month, he was hardly besieged by air-kissing society princesses. He and Ms. Henson circulated largely alone. Some of the prominent young women he claims as friends seem to know him only superficially.</p>
        <p>In the course of his Seventh Avenue apprenticeship, the designer, 38, reinvented himself, in the great American tradition. The only son of a teacher and a school administrator, he rehearsed for his chosen part growing up in Hartsdale, N.Y., in suburban Westchester County. While majoring in English at Manhattanville College, he adopted the uniform he wears to this day -- a slate-colored turtleneck and matching cardigan coiled around his throat. In his college days, the costume raised eyebrows. ''I would walk across the quad, and people stared,'' he recalled. ''Finally, my friend Barbara remarked, 'It's a little too Halston, don't you think?' ''</p>
        <p>Well, maybe. But then, that was the point. With his shoulder-length hair and butter-cream complexion, Mr. Natiello also bears more than a passing resemblance to some of New York's better-known socialites. ''He worships Jamie Gregory and Joanne de Guardiola,'' said Steven Stolman, a fashion designer with stores in Easthampton, N.Y., and Palm Beach, Fla., who travels in the same circles. ''It's gotten to the point where he even looks like them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stolman added: ''It's all very theatrical, the blond hair flying, the cashmere sweaters flapping, very dramatic when you see it coming toward you on the street.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Natiello seems to regard himself as a modern composite of American tastemakers like Mr. Blass, Geoffrey Beene and Halston, of course. He has the manner down: the jaded air and languid posture, the insouciant, designer drawl. One difference is that he lacks the well-known self-irony of his idols. On the sales floor at Saks, he gestured casually toward a black-beaded, sable-trimmed evening dress. ''It has a sense of body, of confidence, of youthfulness -- it's all in the cut of the jib, you know,'' he said, reproducing Mr. Blass's inflections with an eerie Tom Ripley fidelity.</p>
        <p>If his visitors found the performance affected, they gave no clue, laughing in response.</p>
        <p>For the moment, it seems, Mr. Natiello can count on their indulgence. And they can count on him to cater to their desire for self-invention. When many better-established designers have abandoned private fittings, leaving the pinning and tucking to assistants, Mr. Natiello remains a hands-on designer. Fussing over his charges like Cedric Hampton, Nancy Mitford's hyper-refined aesthete in ''Love in a Cold Climate,'' he brings out their inner goddess, and they respond with gratitude.</p>
        <p>''Before I walked down the aisle at my wedding, Craig actually fluffed me,'' trilled Ms. Roosevelt, whose wedding dress Mr. Natiello designed last year.</p>
        <p>For the most part a group of traditional young women whose collective motto might be ''Don't make waves,'' Mr. Natiello's clients rely on him to make them look provocative and just this side of tarty. ''He knows how to push someone's style, maybe make it a little more sexy,'' said Marin Hopper, Elle's fashion director, who has watched Mr. Natiello do fittings. ''He knows how to show off her body in the best way.''</p>
        <p>Much as he was doing at Saks the other day. Coaxing Ms. White, an event planner at the Horticultural Society of New York, who was dressed in a T-shirt, tan trousers and Hermes belt, into a racy black leather jacket, he said, ''It's a little James Bondish, a little pickup thing.''</p>
        <p>''The look is sexy, but never vulgar, that's what I like,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hopper recalled that Mr. Natiello's first job at Blass was in publicity. ''He was very good at introducing the collection to lots of young people,'' she said. ''It was very smart. The house needed a younger spokesperson for the world of American glamour.''</p>
        <p>After he began designing, Ms. Hopper said, it became clear that he had ''incorporated a younger look into a classic style.'' The reaction of fashion editors at the time, she said, was, ''Wow, Bill's never looked so young.''</p>
        <p>The designer's loyalists embrace him as one of their own. ''One thing that makes him mix and match so easily is that he speaks a kind of shorthand that everbody gets,'' said Helen Schifter, a former fashion writer for Vogue.</p>
        <p>Last March at the Oscars party at Morton's in Los Angeles, Ms. Schifter watched Mr. Natiello scrunch up his face and roll his eyes at the passing parade of luminaries. She interpreted his gestures as ''a slightly wicked running commentary on everyone else in the room,'' she said, adding, ''For me, it was the funniest 20 minutes of the whole evening.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Natiello doesn't confine his comments to strangers. At Swifty's, he greeted Mai Harrison, who had wed Ridgely Harrison, the model in the Mr. Jenkins gin advertisements, two weeks earlier at a society ball.</p>
        <p>The designer eyed the nickel-size diamond on her hand. ''Tomorrow she'll fry her coffee on that ring,'' he said, cackling.</p>
        <p>Minutes later, he peered at Ms. Fairchild, the daughter-in-law of John Fairchild, the former Women's Wear Daily publisher. She was wearing gilded Chanel ear tassels and a feathered muffler, which tended to obscure her chin.</p>
        <p>''She has oodles of style -- and she's not hesitant about showing it,'' Mr. Natiello said with a mix of tact and cattiness. ''She can take forever deciding what to wear. Sometimes I think she's all about getting dressed and getting undressed, and why even go to the party?''</p>
        <p>In Mr. Natiello's circle, such barbs might pass for wit. ''When you go out with Craig, you know you're going to have his lens on everything,'' Ms. Schifter said. ''It's sort of like being with Henry James. A lot of people are very talented but have no people skills. I love Marc Jacobs, but Craig is more upbeat in some ways.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Natiello seems to relish his role as society escort. ''He would be in the category of a walker,'' Ms. Greeven of Manhattan File said. She put a positive spin on a term for the sometimes foppish men who accompany wealthy women to parties when their husbands are busy or bored. ''I wish there were more of his kind,'' Ms. Greeven said, sighing. ''People aren't doing that so much anymore.''</p>
        <p>If most young married women who relentlessly go out choose to arrive with a sister these days or in a group of other women or simply by themselves, there is also a contingent of under-35's who are happily updating the walker tradition popularized in the 1980's by the Nancy Reagan set.</p>
        <p>Going out with Mr. Natiello is like ''being in junior high school again,'' said Ms. Schifter, whose husband, Timothy Schifter, is president of LeSportsac, the handbag company. ''You get to gossip in a friendly way. Which husbands in general are not interested in doing.''</p>
        <p>A wave of younger men recognize that the role of escort -- with no expectations beyond making smart conversation and being well groomed -- has its advantages. Being seen at the right party with the right sort of woman is a professional asset, said Todd Romano, a New York decorator. It reinforces the perception, he said, that ''this fellow is a player, he's part of the scene.''</p>
        <p>It also makes for a very good time. ''I don't look at socializing with my customer as work -- it's a pleasure,'' said Mr. Stolman, who has dressed and hobnobbed with clients like Betsy Kaiser, C. Z. Guest and her daughter Cornelia. ''Fashion is one of the few trades in which you're invited to the dinner table, rather than kept below the stairs. I think that's why a lot of people choose to become a fashion designer.''</p>
        <p>Like designers of old, Mr. Natiello is imperious. He issues edicts. Lose the bracelet, he once told Ms. Roosevelt. ''And I did,'' she recalled.</p>
        <p>''No one under 25 should wear my clothing,'' he says haughtily. ''You can't wear these things until you're 30. You don't have a sense of yourself until you're 30.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Natiello's new employers are hoping that the authoritative air, along with a commercial sense he gained at Blass, will finally bring profitability to Halston, a famous name that has been in chaos under four owners in the last six years.</p>
        <p>The latest proprietor of the label founded by Roy Halston Frowick is Neema Clothing Ltd., primarily a maker of men's wear.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Natiello tells it, some months before Mr. Blass announced his retirement last year, he took his assistant aside and told him Halston was searching for a new designer. Mr. Blass wrote a letter recommending Mr. Natiello to Halston's chief executive, Mr. DeMarco, who confirmed this account.</p>
        <p>Why would Mr. Natiello jump to an extremely shaky label when he might have expected to inherit the top job at Blass? ''It was the moment to come out from under the mantle,'' Mr. Natiello explained. ''When I was ready to leave, it was Bill who told me, 'Put your own stamp on it.' And at Halston I can. This is my own gig.''</p>
        <p>His ambition is unlimited. He dreams of rebuilding Halston into the luxury brand it was but has not been for years. ''This is the only fashion house in America that can actually be Gucci-ized,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And he fantasizes about dressing even more of the understated fashion icons of his day. At his showroom on Seventh Avenue last week, Mr. Natiello said: ''You know who's so good at that throwaway thing is Nina Griscom. She has that Babe Paley thing. She always looks like she just came out of the pool, put on that great dress and looks fantastic.''</p>
        <p>Is Ms. Griscom a client? Mr. Natiello flipped back his hair. ''No,'' he replied with a level stare. ''Not yet.''</p>
