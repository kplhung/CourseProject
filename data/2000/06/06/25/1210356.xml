        <p>With the National Hockey League entry draft in Canada, the Saddledome was filled with Canadian fans who came to cheer for Canadian players. But midway through the first round, a man sitting in the upper deck took advantage of a quiet moment to shout toward the stage, ''What is this, a European draft?''</p>
        <p>His perception was at least half accurate. Of the 30 players chosen in the first round, 15 were Europeans. Five others were American, and only 10 were from Canada. And the first Canadian, Dany Heatley, was born in Germany but grew up in Calgary. He plays for the University of Wisconsin and was chosen by Atlanta.</p>

        <p>With the National Hockey League entry draft in Canada, the Saddledome was filled with Canadian fans who came to cheer for Canadian players. But midway through the first round, a man sitting in the upper deck took advantage of a quiet moment to shout toward the stage, ''What is this, a European draft?''</p>
        <p>His perception was at least half accurate. Of the 30 players chosen in the first round, 15 were Europeans. Five others were American, and only 10 were from Canada. And the first Canadian, Dany Heatley, was born in Germany but grew up in Calgary. He plays for the University of Wisconsin and was chosen by Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Of the three teams from the New York metropolitan area, the Islanders and the Devils made the most noise, the Islanders with deals and two picks in the top five, the Devils with seven choices among the first 76. The Rangers had no first-round choice, one in the second round and none in the third. They were scheduled to pick 38th over all, but they traded that choice to Detroit for the Red Wings' picks in the second and third rounds.</p>
        <p>In the second round, with the 64th choice over all, the Rangers drafted Filip Novak, a defenseman from the Czech Republic who played last season with Regina of the Western Canadian junior league. With their pick in the third round, 95th over all, the Rangers chose Dominic Moore, a center from Ontario who plays for Harvard.</p>
        <p>The N.H.L.'s Central Scouting service says Novak is a good skater with a low and accurate shot from the blue line but needs to improve his physical game. He scored seven  goals in 47 games. Moore, according to the same service, is a smooth skater with good speed, hockey sense and backchecking intensity. He scored 12 goals in 28 games.</p>
