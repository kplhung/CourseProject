        <p>I was in the 10th grade when I first began to row. I had no idea what the Sagamore Rowing Association's program was about.</p>
        <p>Here I sit, two years later, soon to row in college, and wonder how to express what Sagamore's program has done for me [''Young Rowers' Biggest Problem is Ashore,'' June 4].</p>
        <p>When I began to row, Timid was my middle name. That first day was the scariest experience of my life. But as we novices sputtered across the water, I felt an upwelling of confidence. From that day forth, I was given the chance to push myself to the limit, to compete against rowers twice my size, to become the victor, not only over other rowers, but over that once-timid self.</p>
        <p>I am going on to row at a different level of competition with the help of the courage that Sagamore's program has given me.</p>
