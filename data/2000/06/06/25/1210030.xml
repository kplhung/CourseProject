        <p>RARELY do audiences emerge from an exhibition smiling. Yet at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, where ''Calder in Connecticut'' is on view through Aug. 6, staff members witness the phenomenon every day. The works that Alexander Calder created during four decades spent mainly in the state reflect his zest for life and playful nature, and visitors seem to find his stance contagious.</p>
        <p>Calder was born in Philadelphia in 1898, the son and grandson of sculptors, and, after receiving a degree in mechanical engineering, studied painting at the Art Students League in New York City and then in Paris.</p>
        <p>It was there that he began making wire sculptures and mechanical toys, which evolved into the figures and animals of Cirque Calder, a much acclaimed one-man performance that evoked all the activities of a circus.</p>
        <p>And it was in Paris that he made friends with Piet Mondrian, Fernand Leger, Marcel Duchamp and Jean Arp, avant-garde artists who influenced his development as an abstract sculptor; Calder was the first artist to create hanging sculptures made up of interconnected forms that rotate slowly in space. It was Duchamp who suggested the name mobile for the moving sculptures and Arp who proposed the word stabile for works that were stationary.</p>
        <p>''When everything goes right,'' Calder wrote later, ''a mobile is a piece of poetry that dances with the joy of life.''</p>
        <p>In 1933, two years after his marriage to Louisa James, Calder bought a run-down farmhouse on 18 acres in Roxbury, with an adjoining icehouse that he converted into a studio, with earthen floor and tree stumps on which to sit and work.</p>
        <p>''It was within this simple studio that Calder produced some of the most dynamic  and vigorous work of his career,'' writes Alexander S. C. Rower, Calder's grandson, in the exhibition's catalog. Later, the icehouse was replaced by a far larger studio,  soon filled with mobiles ''which collided in an unforgettable cacophony -- tinkling, clacking and crashing'' in the words of his grandson.</p>
        <p>''While in Paris and New York, he had worked in small spaces,'' wrote Mr. Rower, who is director of the Alexander and Louisa Calder Foundation, ''but in the country, living in the midst of open fields, he found a new scale.''</p>
        <p>Calder's first pieces created specifically for the outdoors were designed, the sculptor said, ''to react to the wind like a sailing vessel.'' Supported by thin iron rods imbedded in the soil, they proved too weak to stand up to the elements, so, in 1934, he constructed ''Steel Fish'' of welded steel, geometric shapes painted in his favorite, bold primary colors: black and red, with a touch of bright yellow.</p>
        <p>It was the first of many outdoor and indoor sculptures influenced by the landscape, the vegetation, even the climate of Litchfield County: ''Apple Monster,'' for instance, made in 1938 from an apple tree branch, or ''Sumac'', created in 1952, or ''Snow Flurry I'' and ''Fourth Flurry,'' two of a series of graceful white mobiles inspired by a snow storm.</p>
        <p>It was not only the natural environment of Connecticut that was important to Calder's development as an artist, but also the state's culture and society. Most of his monumental pieces were fabricated at iron works in Waterbury and Watertown. Moreover, his home and studio were meeting places for artists and writers, collectors and museum executives.</p>
        <p>Foremost among the latter was Arthur Everett Austin Jr., director of the Wadsworth Atheneum from 1927 to 1945. A champion of the avant-garde, Mr. Austin featured three Calder mobiles in a 1935 exhibition. Later that year the Atheneum was one of the first American museums to buy one of his works, ''Little Blue Panel.''</p>
        <p>The current exhibition's curator, Eric M. Zafran, said ''The Connecticut component of Calder's enormous production complements that of the periods he spent in New York and France, but it has not previously been singled out for review.''</p>
        <p>In the introduction to the catalog, Mr. Zafran recalls how, upon moving to Hartford to work at the Atheneum, he would pass ''by, through or around'' Calder's monumental ''Stegosaurus'' almost every day.  ''To experience this great work, dramatically sited between the art museum and city hall, through every season, is to partake of the genius and humanity of Alexander Calder,'' Mr. Zafran writes, and then he tells of how, in the course of researching another show, he came across many letters from Calder to the museum's staff, from the 1930's on.</p>
        <p>''I was intrigued by his long connection to this institution,'' Mr. Zafran continued. That's when the current exhibition was conceived.</p>
        <p>As he guided a visitor through the attractive galleries -- spacious, white-painted spaces alive with Calder's buoyant creations -- Mr. Zafran, the Atheneum's curator of European paintings and sculpture, pointed out major works including ''Giraffe,'' with its graceful, three-legged body made of yellow sheet metal and a playful, constantly moving hanging part. There is also ''Big Bird,'' a 1937 stabile in bold red and black flanked by a smaller model called ''Little Bird,'' and ''Un Effet du Japonais,'' a 1940 three-legged piece in black with two attachments (one red, one black) of wires and metal circles.</p>
        <p>These large-scale works are accompanied by photographs of Calder alongside his sculptures, at work in his oversized studio or at the foundry, or relaxing with friends and neighbors like Arthur Miller and Inge Morath. Ms. Morath's photographs as well as images by Calder's friends Herbert Matter and James Thrall Soby, record the changes in the sculptor's rugged looks over the years and allow the visitor to envision his varied worlds.</p>
        <p>Calder enjoyed making gifts for his friends, who, in turn, lent them to the exhibition. Among these are miniature versions of his mobiles as well as paintings, jewelry, toys, household items. A silver pin in the shape of a crab, an elephant toy of wood and metal (with nails for legs), a flock of birds crafted from coffee cans -- all his gift creations were touched with humor.</p>
        <p>Toward the end of his life, Calder, whose outdoor works grace cities around the world, was commissioned to create a major public sculpture for the Alfred E. Burr Mall, a site adjacent to the Wadsworth Atheneum and Hartford City Hall. His response was an arch-shaped, red stabile with triangular shapes thrusting up from it: Stegosaurus is 50 feet high and weighs 40 tons.</p>
        <p>The exhibition details how the mall work came about: the search for a suitable sculptor, the selection of Calder, sketches of the proposed work, a model, the installation of the sculpture and the dedication on Oct. 10, 1973.</p>
        <p>Yet only by leaving the Atheneum and walking around the corner can a visitor begin to understand the impact of the monumental work on Hartford's landscape and on the onlooker.</p>
        <p>''Calder in Connecticut'' will be on view at the Wadsworth Atheneum (600 Main Street, Hartford; 860-) until Aug. 6. The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and on the first Thursday of the month until 8 p.m. Admission to the exhibition is $10, $8 for people over 60 and students, $6 for 6-  to 17-year-olds, free for members and children under 6.</p>
