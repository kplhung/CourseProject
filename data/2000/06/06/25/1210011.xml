        <p>SOME filmmakers say it is invaluable in helping them gauge an audience's response. Others say it threatens their integrity. But nearly everyone concedes that movie testing has become a studio addiction not to be kicked any time soon.</p>
        <p>Playing a film to a sample audience before it opens is not new: Frank Capra, Alfred Hitchcock and other greats liked to have their films shown to preview audiences to discern where the laughs or gasps did or didn't come, when there was too much coughing, when the restrooms became too crowded for comfort. But those screenings were spontaneous, casual affairs -- often the studio simply slipped the film into a theater unannounced, and there was nothing scientific about the process.</p>
        <p>These days, for about $15,000 a screening, the studios hire (almost exclusively) the National Research Group, which recruits people whose demographics match those of the film's hoped-for audience. After seeing the movie, the handpicked audience usually fills out cards answering questions about how they liked the film, and a small number may stay for a focus-group discussion. A movie will be tested once, twice, even more times, usually in the Los Angeles area, because that's where most of the movie executives are. And movies change as a result.</p>
        <p>Endings are altered: in ''Fatal Attraction,'' probably the most famous instance, audiences gave thumbs way way down to Glenn Close's committing suicide to music from ''Madama Butterfly'' -- much preferring to see her murdered. Characters are softened: with ''My Best Friend's Wedding,'' test audiences found Julia Roberts's character unsympathetic, so the filmmakers eliminated a few scenes of her conniving and inserted a few more guilt-ridden closeups to turn the numbers around.</p>
        <p>Directors aren't necessarily grateful for help from the peanut gallery, however. ''It's become a brutal, horrendous process,'' said the veteran director John Frankenheimer, who believes the screenings can be manipulated by studio executives. ''If they want to change a movie, they'll often get the demographic they want to support their point of view. It's a leveling process. You're under terrible pressure to make the movie they want, or else they have the power to open it in two theaters somewhere and forget about it.''</p>
        <p>Studio executives were never famous for their courage anyway, and Ed Pressman, the producer of ''Reversal of Fortune,'' says test screenings have made things worse. ''It's become a crutch that allows them to use statistical references,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Think of us as the Gallup Poll for movies,'' said Joe Farrell, who is co-chairman of the National Research Group and was once director of the Harris Poll. And indeed, with consumer products and new television series and even the political positions of candidates all subject to pretesting, why should movies be exempt?</p>
        <p>But just as testing in politics tends to eliminate the McCains and leave us with the Bushes and the Gores, movies may get less interesting the more they are tested. ''There's a kind of homogenization built in to the film testing system,'' said Mike Medavoy, chairman of Phoenix Pictures. ''No one at the studios is willing to take chances anymore -- anticipating how they will test. And just because an audience may not like something that disturbs them or makes them uncomfortable doesn't mean it is not effective moviemaking.''</p>
        <p>But there are believers. ''I've always found that tests turn out pretty similarly to how the movies play ultimately,'' said Terry Press, the marketing head of DreamWorks. The studio's current releases ''Gladiator'' and ''Road Trip'' got positive responses from more than 90 percent of their test audiences and are doing splendidly. ''Erin Brockovich'' also tested well, although executives at Universal were concerned that audiences would not forgive the title character's filthy language. They did, though one audience member noted on his screening card, ''The first 99 times I saw her breasts were enough.'' At Sony they are doing backflips because testings of ''The Patriot,'' opening Wednesday, are ''through the roof,'' according to one executive.</p>
        <p>People in the industry agree that comedies, thrillers and sequels benefit most from test screenings. ''For a comedy person, it's a must,'' said the director Betty Thomas, even though her last film, ''28 Days,'' didn't last quite that long in the theaters. ''My movies have all changed for the better because of tests. I just like to feel when an audience is with it or not. I've taken to videotaping the screenings so that when a studio executive later tells me a particular joke didn't work, I can prove that it did.''</p>
        <p>Dennis Dugan, who directed two of Adam Sandler's highest-grossing movies, likens testing a comedy to a stand-up comedian's performing at the Improv before he does ''The Tonight Show.''  ''My vision is simply, how much fun can we give people in a theater?'' he said. To that end, he tested ''Big Daddy'' and ''Happy Gilmore'' up to five or six times.</p>
        <p>''They may call these dumb comedies, but we have smart people watching them,'' Mr. Dugan said. ''They don't always know the answer, but they can identify a problem. If 50 cards come back telling me they got bored when the character landed at the South Pole, I have to listen.''</p>
        <p>SIMILARLY, the makers of sequels apparently need to know that those who loved Parts 1 and 2 will be there -- and won't be disappointed -- for Part 3.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pressman, a producer of the ''Crow'' films, said test screenings were ''useful as a standard of comparison. You want to know, does it hold up to the original?''</p>
        <p>Dramas, especially those that stray from the beaten path, are another story. Mr. Pressman never considered testing another of his productions, ''American Psycho.''  ''It was structurally and thematically bold, and whether it got a 51 percent or a 62 percent wouldn't define its promise,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The film was released by Lions Gate, which, like other small companies, has neither the money nor the kinds of movies that lend themselves to testing. The films don't cost as much as studio films, so they don't need the mass audience to recoup costs. ''We're not interested in films that have the perfect Hollywood endings,'' said Tom Ortenberg, co-president of Lions Gate Releasing. ''Testing is part of the dumbing down of the business. We rarely test because we still trust our own instincts. Also, our marketing money is too scarce: the money we'd spend on a test could buy another spot on MTV.''</p>
        <p>Those at the big studios, of course, say that they use the test as just one of many tools and that it doesn't mean their gut has gone the way of the typewriter.</p>
        <p>''It's an integral part of the postproduction process, but like any tool it needs to be used with extreme care,'' said Mark Shmuger, president of marketing at Universal Pictures. Films there have from one to six screenings, he said, depending on their complexity. ''When it's misused, it can be a replacement for intuition,'' Mr. Shmuger said. ''But it's misunderstood, it's not about hitting the lucky number. Sometimes within the cards, there's real information. Most of the filmmakers we deal with embrace it.''</p>
        <p>But not all. ''It's a very arduous process that most directors find difficult and simplistic,'' Mr. Pressman said. Andrew Bergman, the director of ''Honeymoon in Vegas'' and other comedies, loathes the process and says that all the information he got from testing his recent ''Isn't She Great'' was that audiences didn't want to watch Bette Midler die. Oliver Stone does not usually test his movies, but he made an exception for ''Natural Born Killers,'' he said, ''because I had to know if it was too way out there.'' On his most recent film, ''Any Given Sunday,'' his contract with Warner Brothers stipulated that if he went over budget, he had to test. He did, so he did.</p>
        <p>''I ended up cutting about 15 minutes after the test,'' Mr. Stone said, ''and I liked feeling the heat of the audience. I don't mind testing, per se, but it's part of this becoming such a product-oriented business. It can ruin the integrity of the film, and the director becomes another cog in the machine.''</p>
        <p>The best-known nontester is the best-known director. ''Steven Spielberg doesn't do it,'' Ms. Press of DreamWorks said. ''Why not? Because he doesn't need to. He just doesn't like the process and doesn't think it can tell him anything he doesn't know.''</p>
        <p>As it happens, one of Mr. Spielberg's contemporaries, Francis Ford Coppola, is credited with the birth of the National Research Group. When the executives behind ''Apocalypse Now'' left the studio, Mr. Coppola hired Joe Farrell to help with the marketing, recalled Mr. Farrell. Seeing a business opportunity, Mr. Farrell went on to found the research company with his partner, Catherine Paura. Mr. Coppola acknowledges his role in the origin of current film testing, but does not like what it has become.</p>
        <p>''I started it for use by the director and now it's the studios that use it, often to present evidence to the director,'' Mr. Coppola said. ''The best preview would be if no one but the filmmaker were there with the audience so he or she could interpret the information. Reviewing theater work is part of a longstanding tradition, and I was looking for a modern way of accomplishing it.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes studios can't test a movie simply because it is finished barely in time to roll it out to the theaters. Sony executives were not pleased that Sydney Pollack was unable to test ''Random Hearts'' before its release last fall, and the director acknowledges that, ''if I have a choice, I prefer not to test.'' But he contends that testing would not have saved the film from poor critical and commercial response. ''It was Harrison Ford in a role people didn't want to see him in,'' he said. ''And they didn't find chemistry between the leads, and you can't fix chemistry in an editing room after the fact. I test my films my own way, in front of people I know or whose taste I respect. The danger of testing is in taking it too literally so you end up making the audience's picture and not yours.''</p>
        <p>Test audiences might have told Mr. Pollack his pacing was slow, a subplot unnecessary -- things studio executives often can't communicate to filmmakers. ''Tests are also useful if we need directors or producers to hear something they don't want to hear from us,'' Ms. Press said.</p>
        <p>''My experience has been when someone won't test, it's because there's something there to worry about,'' said Doug Wick, producer of ''Gladiator,'' ''Stuart Little'' and ''Girl, Interrupted.''</p>
        <p>OF course it is also possible that a director fears losing sight of the vision that inspired the movie in the first place amid hundreds of conflicting views from a test audience and a bunch of nervous executives.</p>
        <p>''I don't feel you get lost, but you do get pulled,'' Ms. Thomas said. ''The hardest part is balancing who to please: the audience, yourself and at some point you have to please someone who put up $50 million to let you make your movie.'' That tug of war can also lead to a tug of tone, which may be what doomed ''28 Days.''</p>
        <p>There are many films -- like ''28 Days'' -- that score highly in tests but do poor business, and others that test poorly but end up doing well. ''Cape Fear'' tested poorly but went on to be Martin Scorsese's most profitable movie. ''Stuart Little'' tested only fairly but did huge business. So, Mr. Bergman said, ''if the test is bad, the studio panics. If it goes well, they say, 'It doesn't mean anything.' ''</p>
        <p>Response cards are one reason many believe the testing process is too blunt an instrument for gauging audience response. ''The cards often tell you things like 'the cats in the movie are too scary for kids,' '' Mr. Wick said. ''But we know that part of the ride for kids is the scariness. They may also say they hated the part where they kill the dog. And yet the filmmaker may decide it's a hate worth experiencing.''</p>
        <p>Some directors agree to the testing but refuse the cards or the focus groups. ''Nothing is going to be enough,'' said Mr. Stone, who didn't allow them for ''Any Given Sunday.''  ''You ask them if it's too long and they always say yes, even if it's 88 minutes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Frankenheimer said: ''You spend a year making a movie, then it comes down to 20 morons in a focus group. They all want to be film critics and are given a chance suddenly.''</p>
        <p>And with test participants broadcasting their opinions on the Internet, the process may be working in reverse. Last year, Universal could not erase the early negative word of mouth after it test-screened ''End of Days.'' Even before the screenings, future film critics may be getting wise. ''There's a whole generation of fans that is going to these tests,'' Mr. Ortenberg of Lions Gate said. ''They find out where there is recruiting going on or they know certain places to go, like the Santa Monica Promenade, where recruiters are always out. They're professional movie testers, and it's made the process more and more meaningless.''</p>
        <p>Despite the drawbacks, Mr. Farrell and company seem to have a lock on the large studios' hearts, minds and wallets. And most of those making the films seem willing to go along, albeit with reservations. ''Tests are mostly valuable because you get a sense of what threads of the story are working or not,'' Mr. Wick said. ''The bad part is they make you more nervous than you need to be. Or you can be forced to take the movie's fangs out by trying to please everyone and then it doesn't do well and then what do you have?''</p>
        <p>What you might have are some memorable audience cards, like Mr. Dugan's favorite, which he keeps framed on his wall. When one respondent was asked how he liked the ending of one of Mr. Dugan's films, he wrote: ''I loved it. Because it was finally over.''</p>
