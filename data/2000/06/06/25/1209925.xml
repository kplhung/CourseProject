        <p>Emotionally Weird</p>
        <p>By Kate Atkinson.</p>
        <p>355 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Picador USA. $25.</p>
        <p>SOMETIMES it's clear in a novel's first 50 pages that its story is going nowhere fast. But there are other times, and harder cases, when a novelist kicks off a book with such lively, crackling prose and such deft character descriptions that you hang on desperately to the hope that its plot is going somewhere good.</p>
        <p>The British writer Kate Atkinson's third novel, ''Emotionally Weird'' -- her debut, ''Behind the Scenes at the Museum,'' won Britain's Whitbread Prize in 1995 -- keeps hope alive so long that it's a bitter disappointment when everything ends up falling apart. The book's first third is a bustling affair, with Atkinson keeping us happily amused and distracted as she introduces a gleefully polychrome cast of characters, most of them students or teachers at Dundee University circa 1972. Here's how she describes one preternaturally disgruntled literature professor who specializes in the 19th-century novel (fixating on the topic ''Why Women Write''): ''Maggie Mackenzie's long iron-gray hair began each day anchored or plaited or rolled in a variety of vaguely Victorian styles but by lunchtime it had begun to work its way free of restraints and encumbrances and by midafternoon she had the appearance of someone leading a tribe of ancient Britons into battle, a gnarled warrior queen bearing grudges.''</p>
        <p>Atkinson has the gift of being able to describe a stereotype (in this case, the 70's-era angry feminist scholar -- the sort that Camille Paglia would later christen ''hangdog dowdies'') in terms that make you laugh in recognition even as they do more than simply recycle cliches. Many of us have encountered those uptight academic buns, but the idea of their wrenching themselves free of the tyranny of hairpins is a new twist.</p>
        <p>But there's a problem with too much clever wordplay and so many enticingly detailed descriptions: they can build you up just to let you down. Atkinson is terrific at setting the stage for her story; she just hasn't given it a very good foundation, and eventually it crumbles away to nothing.</p>
        <p>''Emotionally Weird'' is really two intertwining stories that make for one gangly comic novel. As the book opens, Effie and her mother, Nora, have sequestered themselves in Nora's large, dank family home off the coast of Scotland, where they've decided to wrap themselves in shawls and blankets and tell each other stories. Effie regales her mother with a semi-surreal adventure about her life as a student at Dundee; her narrative includes an array of oddball teachers, a yellow dog that's hit by a car only to be miraculously brought back to life, and a hapless stoner boyfriend named Bob, for whom the Klingons on ''Star Trek'' are as real as ''the French or the Germans, more real certainly than, say, Luxembourgers.'' The madcap tale she spins is made even more mysterious by the fact that someone just may be following her, and she has no idea why.</p>
        <p>Nora's story is more gothic, more tragic, and it involves a series of secrets about Effie's past. It's darker and more conventional than Effie's story, but it's also more engaging, perhaps because it's much more economical. Effie's story, on the other hand, goes on. And on.</p>
        <p>As Effie's tale trundles forward, it becomes more and more apparent that Atkinson is desperately trying to give us a rollicking good time; the harder she tries, the murkier her narrative gets. And she undoes herself by being too clever. At one point Nora interrupts Effie's narrative to ask, mockingly, if a detail that she's just revealed is supposed to be magic realism -- a sly wink from Atkinson that suggests she knows how tiresome that crusty old device can be. But that doesn't stop Atkinson from winking at us again some 100 pages later, when Effie performs a highly unlikely miracle using a scrap of paper and a lighter and then breaks her narrative to tell Nora, ''Now that's magic realism.'' You can mock magic realism or you can punish your readers by subjecting them to it -- but you can't have it both ways.</p>
        <p>Atkinson is so good at describing her characters that she introduces altogether too many of them, and many of the better ones don't have much to do. You want more of some (like Olivia, the quiet, intelligent student who's landed herself in an affair with a rakish teacher) and less of others (stoner Bob is mildly entertaining at first but becomes increasingly numbing with every ''Star Trek''-related quip he comes out with). In the end, Effie's tale -- and Atkinson's whole novel -- becomes burdened with so many extraneous and forcedly bizarre details that it wobbles off its axis. ''Emotionally Weird'' is clearly supposed to be a rumination on the bond between mothers and daughters, and Effie's shaggy-dog story is most likely intended as a metaphorical reflection of her emotional state. Too bad it untwirls itself halfway through like poor Maggie Mackenzie's hairdo, and no amount of frantic wrapping and pinning can contain all its stray ends.</p>
