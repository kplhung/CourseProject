        <p>The generator, somewhere out back, groaned and the bare bulbs blinked. Smokin Wanjala, a lawyer who studies corruption in a nation where there is plenty to study, walked up a dim stairway to his office just before lunchtime.</p>
        <p>''No power at home,'' he said. ''No power at the office. So it's darkness at noon.''</p>
        <p>It is indeed dark in Kenya these days, and not just because electricity is in such short supply that people are forced to dine by candlelight three or four nights a week -- a minor inconvenience given that people are also losing their jobs. Even President Daniel arap Moi has said Kenya -- once among the most stable and prosperous nations in Africa -- is ''facing its worst-ever crisis.''</p>
        <p>The problems are many. But maybe the most worrisome manifestation came two weeks ago when elementary school students rioted for six hours. They stoned a beer truck and then, as newspaper cameras clicked away, drank the beer. The children were angry because the driver of a matatu -- the incomprehensibly dangerous vans that serve as public transport here -- ran over and killed a little boy named Oscar Boyi Simiyu.</p>
        <p>It was only the day before that a matatu ran into the Range Rover in which Mr. Moi himself was riding. Thus chaos and misrule poetically collided at a traffic circle near downtown. No one was seriously hurt, except the driver, who said he was later beaten up at Mr. Moi's official residence, State House.</p>
        <p>''It's not the same place I remember,'' Edward J. Casselle, a United States deputy assistant secretary for commerce, said this week. Mr. Casselle, who traveled around Kenya in brighter days two decades ago, is visiting to promote a new American law aimed at spurring investment in and trade with Africa -- arriving at a distinctly pessimistic moment for Kenya's business climate.</p>
        <p>The actual climate has played a big part in bringing Kenya's long-standing problems to what many people here fear is near-crisis. Nearly three-quarters of Kenyans -- about 22 million people -- will be affected in one way or another by the severe drought that is choking the region, the government estimates. Of those, 2.2 million face the serious prospect of starvation. The Tana River, where the nation's five hydroelectric dams are located, is low. So the government has imposed strict power rationing: Most homes with electricity -- only 10 percent of the nation -- have it only three or four nights a week. Factories get power every other day. Water rationing starts soon.</p>
        <p>But even before the dry weather, the economy was strangling from years of corruption and poor management. The phones and roads are barely passable. Students are rioting. There is turmoil among the coffee and tea growers. Tourists, afraid of runaway crime, are staying away.</p>
        <p>Through it all, Mr. Moi -- who has been in power for almost 22 years -- and his government have declined to accept any blame, though Kenya is so corrupt that the World Bank and International Monetary Fund cut off aid three years ago. In several speeches, Mr. Moi has mostly noted that God makes the weather -- and rain feeds wells and hydroelectric dams.</p>
        <p>''I am not a rainmaker, and Kenyans are not responsible for the drought,'' he said this month in a speech asking the world's rich nations to donate $150 million to feed Kenya's hungry.</p>
        <p>But many Kenyans cannot help but notice that neighboring nations, hit as hard or worse by dry weather, do not have nearly as many problems with power. Or that one of Mr. Moi's top aides, Nicholas Biwott, the former energy minister, has been criticized in Parliament in recent days for mismanaging construction in the 1980's of an expensive dam in the Rift Valley. Critics say the dam adds little to the nation's power grid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wanjala, the corruption expert and an official with the Center for Law and Research here, wondered why there has been so little investment in the power system; why dams were not built on other rivers; why Kenya never pursued a planned deal with Uganda, its western neighbor, which is spilling over with hydroelectric potential.</p>
        <p>''What has not been clear to the Kenyan people is that their day-to-day problems are not necessarily natural,'' Mr. Wanjala said. ''And once that sinks in, it is quite possible that it will be channeled into a serious challenge to the legitimacy of this government.''</p>
        <p>Kenyans are clearly frustrated.</p>
        <p>''It's a desperate situation,'' said one business leader, who asked not to be quoted by name. ''If we don't fix power, the whole country will collapse.'' It is unquestionably a bad time to work for a business with a name like Luka's Electric Welding, as does Edward Maina, 32, a ''very worried'' electric welder. On a recent afternoon, he was writing out a sales order in a huge open air garage outside of downtown, but doing no welding. The four power meters were dead still.</p>
        <p>''This is the only place I get my daily bread,'' said Mr. Maina, who has worked at Luka's for eight years. ''If things go bad I will go hungry.''</p>
        <p>In the industrial area of Nairobi, there is power only every other day, and businessmen like C. M. Waweru have already taken steps. The owner of an electroplating company, he has already cut the hours of four part-time workers, and is seriously thinking about laying off some of his 20 regular workers. He worries his business itself could come next.</p>
        <p>''I think now the government is awake,'' he said with hope in his voice. ''I'm sure they think about it day and night.''</p>
        <p>Maybe so, but the government has announced no plan, except to wait until the short rains start, in September or October.</p>
        <p>Not everyone feels completely dismal about Kenya at the moment. As a result of nearly a year of work by Richard Leakey, a former opposition leader whom Mr. Moi appointed to reform the civil service, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank seem poised to resume aid in the next few months. Unlike nearly all its neighbors, Kenya is not at war and never has been since independence in 1963.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Casselle, the Commerce Department official, said he is confident Kenya will pull through -- although it will be even better, he said, if it enacts the reform measures required for participation in the Africa trade bill.</p>
        <p>''I am confident entrepreneurs will find a way to do business -- profitable business -- in spite of electricity problems, water problems, real problems.</p>
        <p>''I know Kenya is in bad shape,'' he added. ''But believe me, there are places where it is a lot worse.''</p>
        <p>Still, a hairdresser here named Maggie Mukungu sat in her shop, Ringlets, on a recent afternoon, telling customers to come back some other time when the electricity is on. Usually the hairdressers receive a salary, but now they are paid on commission because she does not even think they can cover the rent this month.</p>
        <p>''It's carelessness,'' she said, blaming the government. ''They don't know what they are doing. They should think about that. But they don't plan. They don't care about what happens to people.''</p>
        <p>After a morning of darkness, the lights suddenly flickered to life. But the customers were gone.</p>
        <p>''Now we have it,'' she said. ''But no business. So we just wait.''</p>
