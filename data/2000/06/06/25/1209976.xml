        <p>Stephen S. Hall's portrait of the hip young science students at Midwood High School in Brooklyn (June 4) was encouraging. The recognition, support and even pampering these ''Intel kids'' are receiving could suggest the first stirrings of a cultural movement that may push more young people to appreciate that discovering a gene is as, or even more, important than shooting a round ball through a round hoop.</p>
        <p>The parallels between early scientific achievement and fame and early athletic glory, however, have as many disturbing as salutary implications: the investment of a young person's energies in a single, all-consuming enterprise and the seductive promise of present and future financial rewards.</p>
        <p>Science is undoubtedly a young person's game. But these budding scholars might become happier people and more productive scientists if they were taught to harness rather than exhaust their energies. I fear that the 18-hour days that Midwood's scholars are obliged to spend in their laboratories may deprive them of the time they need to cultivate their secret gardens.</p>
