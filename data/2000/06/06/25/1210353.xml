        <p>Hoping to reverse a long slide into irrelevance and buoyed by the financial promises of new ownership, the Islanders moved aggressively, dramatically and with high risk today at the National Hockey League entry draft in the Saddledome.</p>
        <p>They made three major trades and lost two goalies, including the prime prospect Roberto Luongo. They acquired two young forwards from Florida and a veteran defenseman from Edmonton. And they drafted two of the first five players, including the first over all.</p>

        <p>Hoping to reverse a long slide into irrelevance and buoyed by the financial promises of new ownership, the Islanders moved aggressively, dramatically and with high risk today at the National Hockey League entry draft in the Saddledome.</p>
        <p>They made three major trades and lost two goalies, including the prime prospect Roberto Luongo. They acquired two young forwards from Florida and a veteran defenseman from Edmonton. And they drafted two of the first five players, including the first over all.</p>
        <p>That opening pick was historic: Rick DiPietro, a Maine native from Boston University, became the first goalie chosen No. 1. Mike Milbury, general manager of the Islanders, strongly suggested that the 18-year-old DiPietro, with one year of college experience, would be his first-string goalie next season.</p>
        <p>''As dangerous as this might be, maybe Mad Mike has something going for him,'' Milbury said of his dealings for a team that last reached the playoffs in 1994. ''We have not made the playoffs in far too long. We need to get there. It's a roll of the dice a little bit.''</p>
        <p>In trades, the Islanders acquired center Oleg Kvasha and right wing Mark Parrish from Florida. On defense, they picked up Roman Hamrlik from Edmonton to anchor their power play. Headed for arbitration and expected to make well in excess of $2 million, Hamrlik will be the Islanders' highest-salaried player.</p>
        <p>With their second choice, fifth over all in the first round, the Islanders selected Raffi Torres, a stocky left wing from Canada, who scored 43 goals with Brampton last season in the Ontario junior league. Torres's father was born in Mexico and his mother was born in Peru.</p>
        <p>Milbury said he still needed to find a backup goalie. He could also add veterans at defense and forward, perhaps through free agency. In his five years on the job, Milbury's critics have cited what they see as his impatience, and today's dealings will not change that perception.</p>
        <p>''I don't care,'' Milbury said when asked about those critics. ''We've suffered slings and arrows of critics over the years. We're a lot closer to a playoff spot today than we were yesterday. We've pushed ourselves ahead a couple of years.''</p>
        <p>Referring to the trades of players like Luongo and Eric Brewer, Milbury admitted they were ''significant assets'' but added: ''We didn't get chopped liver in return. We filled the holes we wanted to fill. It's a win-win day for us. We're doing a little dance over at the Islanders table.''</p>
        <p>Milbury compared DiPietro to Tom Barrasso, who had a record of 26-12-3 for the Buffalo Sabres as an 18-year-old rookie in 1983-84, when he won the Vezina trophy as the top goaltender and the Calder trophy as the top rookie. Like Barrasso, DiPietro is a left-hander who catches pucks with the big glove on the right hand -- rare for hockey.</p>
        <p>''I feel relieved the day is over and we made a little history,'' DiPietro said. ''I was pleasantly surprised to hear my name called.''</p>
        <p>Can he step into a major role in the N.H.L.? ''I don't know,'' DiPietro said. ''I feel pretty confident. It's obviously very mind-boggling.'' Referring to the pressure he will face, he said: ''Obviously, there's going to be a lot of pressure. Roberto Luongo will probably end up being a franchise goaltender with Florida. I enjoy the pressure.''</p>
        <p>Torres was asked about comparisons to Scott Gomez of the Devils, who won rookie of the year honors last season as the league's first Hispanic star. ''Gomez was a highlight player in his first year; I'd like to follow in his footsteps,'' Torres said. ''I'm so excited. It's crazy.''</p>
        <p>Milbury said he was not sure if the 18-year-old Torres was ready for the N.H.L. because there were questions about his skating, but he is likely to get a full chance in training camp.</p>
        <p>The Islanders sent Luongo, their top goalie prospect until today, to Florida along with center Olli Jokinen for Kvasha and Parrish. In order to choose Torres with the fifth pick over all, originally a Tampa Bay choice, the Islanders sent goalie Kevin Weekes and the defense prospect Kristian Kudroc to the Lightning along with the second-round pick in the 2001 draft. The Islanders also obtained Tampa Bay's fourth-round pick in this draft, which will conclude Sunday with Rounds 4 through 9. The Islanders also get a seventh-round pick this year.</p>
        <p>To get Hamrlik from the Oilers, the Islanders sent Brewer, Josh Green and a second-round choice. Luongo was the Islanders' first-round choice in 1997 and, at fourth over all, was the highest-drafted goalie until today. Brewer was drafted that same year at No. 5 in the first round.</p>
        <p>DiPietro went 17-3-5 last season with a goals against average of 2.44. He is 5 feet 11 inches and 185 pounds and made the tournament all-star team when he played for the United States in the world junior championships. He set a National Collegiate Athletic Association record with 77 saves in one game, a 3-2 defeat in four overtimes to St. Lawrence.</p>
        <p>The report of the N.H.L.'s Central Scouting service makes DiPietro seem like Martin Brodeur of the Devils: ''Handles the puck extremely well. Is very good at setting up the puck for his defensemen. A very good skater, with excellent agility and balance. Uses his stick well to deflect pucks away from the net. Has a very quick glove hand and uses his blocker to angle shots into the corner very well.''</p>
        <p>Torres, according to the Central Scouting report, is ''a shifty skater with very good agility and balance.''</p>
        <p>It continued: ''Excellent straight-away speed. A very strong puckhandler who excels in one-on-one situations. A tireless skater with outstanding endurance and high energy. Has a hard, accurate shot with a quick release. Very dangerous around the net. Very effective at forcing turnovers. A focused player who plays a disciplined game.''</p>
        <p>Kvasha, a Moscow native, who is 6-5 and 216 pounds, had 5 goals and 20 assists last season in 78 games. Parrish, who also came from Florida, grew up in Minnesota and, like Kvasha, has played two years with Florida. Parrish, 5-11 and 191 pounds, had 26 goals and 18 assists in 81 games with the Panthers.</p>
