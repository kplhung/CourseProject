        <p>Covenant House, the refuge for runaway teenagers, had hoped that installing a large video billboard on one of its buildings would furnish some much-needed revenue. Instead, the charity has harvested community resentment and the ire of the Department of Buildings, which said the sign was illegal and must be taken down.</p>
        <p>Soon after the 25-foot video screen appeared on top of the Covenant House crisis shelter at 41st Street and 10th Avenue, nearby residents complained that the brightly flashing images made sleep impossible. Residents were also angered that they were not told of the sign before it went up June 12.</p>
        <p>Leni Schwendinger, a director of the Hell's Kitchen Neighborhood Association, recently said the sign reminds her of the ''hypercommercialization'' of Times Square.</p>
        <p>''It flies in the face of the kind of development we want to see in this area,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Christine Quinn, a councilwoman, called the video screen ''a 24-hour visual fireworks display.''</p>
        <p>Covenant House struck a deal last year with Colossal Vision, a video billboard company, to lease space on its roof for a sign in exchange for a percentage of advertising revenue from it. A ceremony was held the day the sign first appeared, attended by former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a supporter of Covenant House, among others.</p>
        <p>Richard Hirsh, a Covenant House spokesman, said, ''We did not allow someone to put a sign on the roof without putting through the requisite guidelines.''</p>
        <p>But he later added, ''We are beginning to find ourselves in the middle of something that we don't know an awful lot about.'' The matter has been referred to the group's lawyers, he said.</p>
        <p>David Niles, a spokesman for Colossal Vision, said the sign was made by Saco, the maker of the Nasdaq billboard in Times Square. The sign's 192,720 light-emitting diodes show images on a 25-by-35-foot screen.</p>
        <p>But the buildings department said the advertising billboard is illegal because it is too close to the Lincoln Tunnel, one of about 60 roads for which the agency has prohibited advertising within 200 feet. And while Colossal Vision had permits, they specify a nonadvertising sign.</p>
        <p>Ilyse Fink, a department spokeswoman, said Covenant House could promote itself on the sign, but not anything else.</p>
        <p>Mr. Niles said Colossal Vision had hired a contractor to remeasure the distance between the billboard and the Lincoln Tunnel. If the sign is farther than 200 feet from the tunnel, as Colossal Vision contends, the company will seek to have the nonadvertising permits amended to allow advertising. ''Administrative error more than anything else,'' Mr. Niles said, caused the permits to be filed as nonadvertising.</p>
        <p>After the complaints began, Colossal Vision dimmed the sign by more than 50 percent in the evening and turned it off after midnight, Mr. Niles said. A spokesman for Ms. Quinn said her constituents had not seen a big difference.</p>
        <p>The sign's sole advertiser, the cable network A&amp;E, removed its ad after a few days, citing complaints about the bright screen, said Gary Morgenstein, a spokesman.</p>
        <p>''It's very unfortunate that Covenant House has found itself in this situation,'' Ms. Fink said. ''It begs the question, who is responsible? That's something our department will investigate.''</p>
