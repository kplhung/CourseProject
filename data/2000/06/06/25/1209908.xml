        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>BEE SEASON, by Myla Goldberg. (Doubleday, $22.95.) An intelligent, dispassionate first novel that constructs and deconstructs a somewhat off-center Jewish family whose lives change when a hitherto ordinary fifth-grade daughter turns out to be an all-American spelling bee champ.</p>
        <p>BOSIE: A Biography of Lord Alfred Douglas, by Douglas Murray. (Talk Miramax/Hyperion, $27.50.) A remarkable effort to see whole and uncaricatured the beautiful rich boy who became infamous for his betrayal of Oscar Wilde. The author, it is worth knowing, is 20 years old.</p>
        <p>THE GRAVITY OF SUNLIGHT, by Rosa Shand. (Soho, $24.) An acutely sensuous first novel whose deft plotting follows the precarious marriage of two Americans living in Uganda toward 1971 and the seizure of power by the terrifying Idi Amin; their real love affair is with the country itself.</p>
        <p>GROUCHO: The Life and Times of Julius Henry Marx, by Stefan Kanfer. (Knopf, $30.) A vivid, cleanly written biography of the acerbic vaudeville clown who became, at last, the mean man he had long pretended to be.</p>
        <p>JIM THE BOY, by Tony Earley. (Little, Brown, $23.95.) A first novel, a coming-of-age novel, a Southern novel -- and yet no monsters, no parental abuse, erotic turmoil or domestic dysfunction! This clear, balanced, understated book makes growing up seem somehow possible.</p>
        <p>KING DAVID: A Biography, by Steven L. McKenzie. (Oxford University, $25.) The texts -- nothing is known of David outside the Hebrew Bible -- are sharply cross-examined by a scholar to see how the story stands up after 3,000 years.</p>
        <p>MOTHERHOOD MADE A MAN OUT OF ME, by Karen Karbo. (Bloomsbury, $23.95.) Motherhood is the lead character in this peevishly hilarious novel that contains two plots about two women, close friends but in circumstances very unlike, except both are having babies, or have had or will.</p>
        <p>PAPAL SIN: Structures of Deceit, by Garry Wills. (Doubleday, $25.) An argument, angry and sorrowful, by a Roman Catholic who thinks the concentration of authority in the pope has led to ever more lamentable cover-ups of mistakes and assertions of things that are not so.</p>
        <p>PLOWING THE DARK, by Richard Powers. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $25.) An awfully smart novel of brute juxtaposition that crosscuts between two screening rooms of the mind: a cell in Beirut where an American hostage is held and a virtual-reality lab in Seattle.</p>
        <p>THE YEAR OF JUBILO: A Novel of the Civil War, by Howard Bahr. (Holt, $25.) Time and place are skillfully evoked while large, sweeping, cinematic events stay in the sights of this tale of the war's aftermath in little, ruined Cumberland, Miss.</p>

        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>BEE SEASON, by Myla Goldberg. (Doubleday, $22.95.) An intelligent, dispassionate first novel that constructs and deconstructs a somewhat off-center Jewish family whose lives change when a hitherto ordinary fifth-grade daughter turns out to be an all-American spelling bee champ.</p>
        <p>BOSIE: A Biography of Lord Alfred Douglas, by Douglas Murray. (Talk Miramax/Hyperion, $27.50.) A remarkable effort to see whole and uncaricatured the beautiful rich boy who became infamous for his betrayal of Oscar Wilde. The author, it is worth knowing, is 20 years old.</p>
        <p>THE GRAVITY OF SUNLIGHT, by Rosa Shand. (Soho, $24.) An acutely sensuous first novel whose deft plotting follows the precarious marriage of two Americans living in Uganda toward 1971 and the seizure of power by the terrifying Idi Amin; their real love affair is with the country itself.</p>
        <p>GROUCHO: The Life and Times of Julius Henry Marx, by Stefan Kanfer. (Knopf, $30.) A vivid, cleanly written biography of the acerbic vaudeville clown who became, at last, the mean man he had long pretended to be.</p>
        <p>JIM THE BOY, by Tony Earley. (Little, Brown, $23.95.) A first novel, a coming-of-age novel, a Southern novel -- and yet no monsters, no parental abuse, erotic turmoil or domestic dysfunction! This clear, balanced, understated book makes growing up seem somehow possible.</p>
        <p>KING DAVID: A Biography, by Steven L. McKenzie. (Oxford University, $25.) The texts -- nothing is known of David outside the Hebrew Bible -- are sharply cross-examined by a scholar to see how the story stands up after 3,000 years.</p>
        <p>MOTHERHOOD MADE A MAN OUT OF ME, by Karen Karbo. (Bloomsbury, $23.95.) Motherhood is the lead character in this peevishly hilarious novel that contains two plots about two women, close friends but in circumstances very unlike, except both are having babies, or have had or will.</p>
        <p>PAPAL SIN: Structures of Deceit, by Garry Wills. (Doubleday, $25.) An argument, angry and sorrowful, by a Roman Catholic who thinks the concentration of authority in the pope has led to ever more lamentable cover-ups of mistakes and assertions of things that are not so.</p>
        <p>PLOWING THE DARK, by Richard Powers. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $25.) An awfully smart novel of brute juxtaposition that crosscuts between two screening rooms of the mind: a cell in Beirut where an American hostage is held and a virtual-reality lab in Seattle.</p>
        <p>THE YEAR OF JUBILO: A Novel of the Civil War, by Howard Bahr. (Holt, $25.) Time and place are skillfully evoked while large, sweeping, cinematic events stay in the sights of this tale of the war's aftermath in little, ruined Cumberland, Miss.</p>
