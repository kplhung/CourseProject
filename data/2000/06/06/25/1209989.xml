        <p>IN 1943, the 26-year-old Maya Deren collaborated with her husband, Alexander Hammid, a Czech refugee and ace cinematographer, on ''Meshes of the Afternoon,'' a short, silent, black-and-white film, dense with visual metaphors and as open to interpretation as a dream. While not the first American avant-garde film, ''Meshes'' is among the most influential, not only because of its complexity and beauty but also because Ms. Deren, a compelling speaker and writer, used it to promote a filmmaking method and aesthetic contrary to Hollywood's. Through her films and her critical writing, she made the case that cinema was as serious an art as painting and poetry.</p>

Although Ms. Deren completed only six short films and left several large projects unfinished at the time of her death in 1961, she placed in an American context the themes that preoccupied avant-garde filmmakers, men as well as women, for the rest of the century: psychodrama; ritual; the filmmaker as performer; the abstraction of film space and time from the constraints of storytelling; the kinetic relationship of film and dance; and film as a medium of both ethnographic documentation and personal, poetic expression.</p>

        <p>IN 1943, the 26-year-old Maya Deren collaborated with her husband, Alexander Hammid, a Czech refugee and ace cinematographer, on ''Meshes of the Afternoon,'' a short, silent, black-and-white film, dense with visual metaphors and as open to interpretation as a dream. While not the first American avant-garde film, ''Meshes'' is among the most influential, not only because of its complexity and beauty but also because Ms. Deren, a compelling speaker and writer, used it to promote a filmmaking method and aesthetic contrary to Hollywood's. Through her films and her critical writing, she made the case that cinema was as serious an art as painting and poetry.</p>
        <p>Ms. Deren is a featured filmmaker in the ''The Color of Ritual, the Color of Thought: Women Avant-Garde Filmmakers in America, 1930-2000,'' a series at the Whitney Museum of American Art from Thursday to July 30 and from Sept. 5 to Oct. 1. Although Ms. Deren completed only six short films and left several large projects unfinished at the time of her death in 1961, she placed in an American context the themes that preoccupied avant-garde filmmakers, men as well as women, for the rest of the century: psychodrama; ritual; the filmmaker as performer; the abstraction of film space and time from the constraints of storytelling; the kinetic relationship of film and dance; and film as a medium of both ethnographic documentation and personal, poetic expression.</p>
        <p>Chrissie Iles, the Whitney's curator of film and video, has structured her sprawling series around these themes. In addition to eight featured filmmakers -- Mary Ellen Bute, Shirley Clarke, Helen Levitt, Marie Menken, Yoko Ono, Yvonne Rainer, Chick Strand and Ms. Deren -- the show includes some 40 others, several of whom produced films every bit as powerful as those of the featured eight.</p>
        <p>Ms. Iles, who is British, came to the Whitney in 1997. Her baptism by fire came last year when she organized the film and video section of the ''American Century'' show. Many of the films in the current series were shown there, and it was then that Ms. Iles noticed the striking relationships among them and formulated the idea of a show that would tease them out.</p>
        <p>She was disturbed, however, by the way the Whitney's general audience ignored the film and video programs. ''On the weekends, the shows were packed with dedicated avant-garde film viewers who came from everywhere,'' she said. ''But during the week, the film and video gallery was almost empty.'' While people who visit museums to look at painting and sculpture are willing to park themselves on benches in front of a video installation for 20 minutes, they often find the prospect of sitting in a dark room watching films for two hours unappealing.</p>
        <p>''The art world is basically ignorant of avant-garde film,'' Ms. Iles continued. ''And that's never been more obvious than today, when galleries are filled with film-video installations by young visual artists. If you know avant-garde film, much of this work, by comparison, seems very slight.'' In her mission to lure the art world to avant-garde film, Ms. Iles is experimenting with the space of the film and video gallery. On weekdays, a few benches will replace the customary chairs. She has selected one or two films by each of the featured filmmakers, and these will play continuously throughout the day, as if they were installations. On the weekends, the chairs will return, and the films are programmed in groups that emphasize the connections between them.</p>
        <p>Some films are better suited to this installation format than others. Marie Menken's delicate ''Sidewalks,'' which has the hieroglyphic elegance and wit of a Cy Twombly painting, and her Pop Art ''Wrestling,'' filmed in close-up from a television screen, work quite well. So does Helen Levitt, Janice Loeb and James Agee's lyrical New York documentary ''In the Street'' and Ms. Deren's second film, ''At Land,'' in which she further develops the psychodrama of ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' as well as her radically disjunctive use of space. Ms. Deren stars in both ''Meshes'' and ''At Land,'' and her strikingly narcissistic presence commands attention on the screen. But it seems a bit perverse to show Shirley Clarke's early, derivative short films, ''Bridges Go Round'' and ''A Moment in Love,'' 15 times a day for four days while relegating her powerful, groundbreaking features, ''The Cool World'' and ''Portrait of Jason,'' to a single weekend screening each.</p>
        <p>Though not arranged chronologically, ''The Color of Ritual, the Color of Thought'' is a 70-year survey, probably the biggest show of avant-garde female filmmakers ever mounted. Some of the films, like the abstract animations that Mary Ellen Bute made in the 1930's, are largely of historic interest. But others seem as provocative, emotionally wrenching and downright dangerous as when they were first shown. Among those I'd place Ms. Rainer's ''Journeys From Berlin/1971,'' Ms. Clarke's ''Portrait of Jason'' and, most extraordinary of all, Barbara Rubin's ''Christmas on Earth.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rainer, a celebrated choreographer and dancer, turned to film in part to accommodate her gift for gab. ''Journeys From Berlin/1971'' takes the form of an extended debate waged around the issue of terrorism. Its conflicting moral positions can be read as the expression of a painfully divided self. The film's most gripping element is the performance of the art and film historian Annette Michelson as a psychoanalytic patient, filled with self-loathing and pondering suicide.</p>
        <p>In ''Portrait of Jason,'' Ms. Clarke uses the camera as a weapon to shatter the self-image of Jason, a gay African-American man, in real time over the course of a single night. In the implicit, one-on-one sadomasochism of the voyeuristic filmmaker and the exhibitionistic performer, the film owes a great deal to Andy Warhol's portrait films. But because race comes into play here, the power relationship is more extreme and disturbing.</p>
        <p>MS. RUBIN made ''Christmas on Earth'' in 1964, when she was just 17. It's her only completed film. Like Ms. Deren, Ms. Clarke, Ms. Rainer and many other filmmakers in the show, she was intensely competitive with the most celebrated male artists in her milieu. (The main problem with women-only shows is that this competitive dynamic is not acknowledged.) ''Christmas on Earth'' was made at a moment when avant-garde filmmakers like Warhol and Jack Smith were shocking audiences with explicit sexual imagery, most of it homoerotic. In a passionate countermove, Ms. Rubin opens her film with a close-up of a vagina, spread like a landscape across the entire screen. But the initial bravado of this image gives way to an extreme anxiety. Now that the long-absent icon is at last front and center, what should it do or what should be done with it? Far from a celebration of female sexuality, the film shows a terrible ambivalence toward its central image, and despite its hard-core action, a total absence of desire.</p>
        <p>Unlike Ms. Deren's films, which have a secure position in the avant-garde canon, ''Christmas on Earth'' has lapsed into obscurity. Not the least virtue of this ambitious show is giving it new life.</p>
