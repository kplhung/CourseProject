        <p>Rachel Marin Freeman, a daughter of Lucile and Harry L. Freeman of Chevy Chase, Md., was married yesterday to Bruce Bridges Wilson, a son of Kay Wilson and Dr. Jack Wilson of Mountain Home, Ark. The Rev. Dr. Theodore R. Rosche, a Presbyterian minister, performed the ceremony at the Decatur House Museum in Washington.</p>
        <p>Ms. Freeman, 32, is keeping her name. She is the Midwest economic development specialist for the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Chicago. From 1995 to 1997, she was the general director of the Volkhov Business Incubator, which assists businesses operated by women in Volkhov, Russia; she remains a director of the organization. She graduated from Middlebury College and received an M.B.A. from the University of Michigan.</p>
        <p>Her father, who retired as the executive vice president of American Express in New York, is the chairman and founder of the Mark Twain Institute, an organization in Chevy Chase that gives grants for economic research. Her mother retired as the head of the public library in Poolesville, Md.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson, 34, is a senior manager at Andersen Consulting in Chicago. He received a bachelor's degree and an M.B.A. from Washington University. His mother retired as an English teacher at the Mountain Home High School. His father is a family physician in Mountain Home.</p>
        <p>The couple, who met at a wedding in 1998, credit the bride's dog, Sunder, a Central Asian shepherd, with bringing them together. When they were first dating, Ms. Freeman was touched by the care Mr. Wilson lavished on Sunder when the dog became ill.</p>
        <p>''I knew then that he was a good person,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The dog also played a part in moving the couple closer together and keeping them there. Early in their relationship, Ms. Freeman decided to move to Chicago, where Mr. Wilson was living, because she felt the climate would suit the dog. Later, Mr. Wilson passed up a job in Singapore, which was too steamy for Sunder.</p>
        <p>''I have no illusions that if I weren't somebody who really enjoys that sort of close man-dog relationship, the connection wouldn't have been there,'' Mr. Wilson said.</p>
        <p>While the dog did not attend the wedding, her picture was affixed above a copy of the couple's wedding vows, which the guests signed.</p>
