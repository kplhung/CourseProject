        <p>LINES are beginning to form for the Round-Up and the Tilt-a-Whirl. Young children are picking their favorite ponies on the carousel, while thrill-seekers rock their buckets on the Big Gondola Ferris Wheel to make them flip over.</p>
        <p>This is the last night of Our Lady of Czestochowa's five-day summer carnival here, and with the scorching afternoon heat giving way to a warm but not unbearable evening, it looks like it's going to be a good one.</p>
        <p>On this same June weekend, 30 other carnivals are taking place throughout New Jersey, some as part of a larger event, like the Ocean County Fair in Berkeley Township. But most are the main attraction, sponsored by churches, fire departments, schools or Lions Clubs, raising funds for a local cause.</p>
        <p>In places where not much happens the rest of the year, the annual ritual of the carnival coming to town is a much-anticipated event. For a day, a weekend, or a week, a sleepy suburb like this one, just north of Edison, takes on the aura of Coney Island or Atlantic City, when a band of travelling showmen lure the locals with their bright lights, loud music and promise of adventure.</p>
        <p>For the likes of Police Officer Brad Bullard, the carnival is the big event of the summer.</p>
        <p>''Everybody in town comes out for this,'' said Officer Bullard, who had already covered the midnight-to-7 a.m. security detail here but was back again to enjoy the fair with his wife and two children. ''We mostly come for the kids, but it's also the once-a-year chance for everybody to get together and see each other.''</p>
        <p>For others, who worry about the cost of tickets and the safety of the rides, the carnival coming to town is a mixed blessing.</p>
        <p>''They love it, but it's a little tough on mom's pocketbook,'' said JoEllen Giacomini of South Bound Brook, pointing to her 6-year-old daughter in the Moon Bounce and her 10-year-old daughter on the Ferris wheel, whose three-minute thrills cost a total of about five dollars. ''These carnivals make me nervous, the way they put these rides up in such a hurry and take them down in such a hurry, and I don't know about some of these carnival workers. I prefer the big parks.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Giacomini is not alone in her perception that carnivals, by their itinerant nature, are less safe and less reliable than the sprawling and established amusement parks like Six Flags-Great Adventure or the sites along the Jersey Shore. But statistically and anecdotally, the evidence appears otherwise.</p>
        <p>In a report made public in July 1999 called ''Amusement Ride-Related Injuries and Deaths in the U.S.,'' the Consumer Product Safety Commission found that of the 43 ride-related deaths that occurred from 1987 to 1998 nationwide, 7 took place at mobile shows, while 28 were at permanent parks (the locations of the other eight were reported as unknown). And of the 9,200 serious injuries reported around the country in 1998, 2,100 occurred on mobile rides while 4,500 took place on fixed rides (with 2,600 of unknown origin.)</p>
        <p>To some extent, the numbers are affected by the kinds of rides featured in fixed parks, generally of the more daring variety. Three of the reported deaths during that 11-year period took place in New Jersey -- all on roller coasters, a ride that accounted for 10 of the 43 deaths -- and one that is generally not found at the carnival.</p>
        <p>While the Consumer Product Safety Commission has jurisdiction over travelling amusement shows, it has not had the same authority over fixed parks since 1981 after several court challenges by the owners of some large parks.</p>
        <p>As recently as last year, Representative Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, introduced a bill to restore the commission's power to recall unsafe equipment and conduct investigations of amusement parks. But the commission is largely an after-the-fact reporting and investigative body, while the real regulating arm for both fixed parks and traveling carnivals is at the state level.</p>
        <p>And indeed, New Jersey's system of ride regulations and inspections is considered one of the most comprehensive in the nation.</p>
        <p>After a death on a water slide and 24 other serious injuries in New Jersey in 1997, the state updated its Carnival-Amusement Ride safety Act in April 1998. The new law increased fines for safety violations to $5,000 from $500. It also toughened reporting requirements, called for more warning signs and gates for all rides, and added a ''rider responsibility'' clause that allowed operators to post warnings that riders acting in a reckless manner could be removed from rides and even charged with disorderly behavior.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the oversight of amusement rides shifted from the state's Department of Labor to the Division of Codes and Standards in the Department of Community Affairs.</p>
        <p>William Connolly, director of the Division of Codes and Standards, said in a recent interview in the last two years his division has doubled the number of ride inspectors to 13, added 3 engineers and instituted a program in which inspectors examined the rides three or four times during the year as well as at the beginning of the season before issuing permits.</p>
        <p>M OREOVER, during the off-season, the state also subjects some rides to X-rays and ultrasound tests to detect cracks, stress or metal fatigue that can not be seen by the naked eye.</p>
        <p>Mr. Connolly credited the stepped-up program with a significant drop in serious injuries throughout the state -- 12 in 1999 compared with 24 in 1997. Conversely, the number of incident reports has more than doubled in that time, to 567 in 1999 from 283 in 1997, as a result of stricter reporting standards, he said, with the state now requiring ride operators to file a report for every scratch or bout of dizziness.</p>
        <p>''The number of incidents is very small,'' Mr. Connelly said. ''You're six times more likely to be hurt in a neighborhood park. Ten times as many people get killed in train accidents. It's more dangerous driving to the amusement park. But it's particularly compelling when someone gets hurt on a ride because it's supposed to be fun.''</p>
        <p>Despite the precautions, accidents do happen. At the end of last summer, a mother and her 8-year-old daughter were killed when the brakes on their roller coaster car failed and they rolled backwards down a 40 feet incline and smashed into another car at Gillian's Wonderland Pier in Ocean City. In response,</p>
        <p>Assemblyman George F. Geist, a Republican from Blackwood, introduced yet another updated version of the carnival safety law last month that would extend the burden of responsibility to the manufacturers of the rides. The measure would require the makers to register all rides entering the state, submit detailed documentation -- including risk analysis, load and stress analysis and installation and operating requirements -- plus report any malfunctioning of rides that may have caused serious injuries outside of New Jersey. Failure to comply would result in a $50,000 fine. Ride owners would also be required to report any ride malfunctioning to the state.</p>
        <p>''With the current law, we established owner, operator and rider accountability,'' Mr. Geist said in an interview. ''The new law will complete the accountability circle by focusing on the manufacturer. Carnivals are here today, gone tomorrow, which makes them more difficult to investigate. With the manufacturers, we have a nexus to approach, it gives us another recourse besides the carnival.''</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the carnival industry is distressed by the threat of more stringent regulations.</p>
        <p>Bob Johnson, executive director of the Outdoor Amusement Business Association, the 4,000-member trade organization of the carnival industry, complained that the proposed legislation would make New Jersey's amusement ride safety law the toughest in the nation, and said he feared that the amount of reporting would be onerous to the operators.</p>
        <p>''We certainly support safety measures to protect the patrons,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''On the other hand, as a result of the media attention ride accidents receive, there may be a certain amount of overreaction by the legislature, in spite of the industry's excellent safety record.''</p>
        <p>Manufacturers like Zamperla -- an Italian company best known for its spinning teacups, swing rides and speedway -- are also strongly opposed to the proposed amendments. Debbie Israel, a spokeswoman for Zamperla, which has its American headquarters in Parsippany, said the company found the legislation ''excessive and unreasonable.''</p>
        <p>''We have no problem being part of the equation for responsibility,'' Ms. Israel said. ''We already provide certifications for fabrication and design, inspection schedules, training manuals. It's not like we just say, 'Here's your ride, have a good summer.' The proposed legislation doesn't change the strict responsibility already imposed on us. It just adds an extra layer of paperwork, causing delays and in some cases, altogether preventing us from doing business.''</p>
        <p>And even though the proposed law would somewhat shift responsibility from ride operators to manufacturers, people who run the carnivals are equally skeptical of its efficacy.</p>
        <p>''It's a lot of grandstanding,' said John Tolve Sr., owner of Tolve Presentations, a Lyndhurst-based travelling show that puts on the carnival at Our Lady of Czestochowa as well as about 30 others each year. ''These rides are all done on computers today. I'm sure when they design these rides, they are take all the safety factors into consideration. And once the ride leaves the manufacturer, what's his responsibility?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tolve also bristled at the fly-by-night characterization of the carnival operator. ''We're not 'gone tomorrow.' '' he said. ''We're coming back again next year. We've been playing some of the same of the same spots for 20, 25 years. We have to leave a good reputation in people's mouths.''</p>
        <p>With new rides costing from $100,000 to $500,000 each, carnival operators carry large mortgage notes on many of their rides. Add the huge insurance policies, large staffs and the many overhead costs associated with a travelling show -- plus the vagaries of the weather -- and a small fortune is tied up in the medium-to-large operations that travel from church lot to dusty field to shopping center. As carnival operators insist, they are the last ones who want to see an accident, which could result in the shutting down of a ride, fines and lawsuits.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Johnson of the amusement association put it: ''These are family-owned businesses, many in their second, third or fourth generation. They want to make sure their business is safe and viable and something they can turn over to the next generation.''</p>
        <p>Fred McDaniel said he couldn't afford to go to the carnival when it came to town each year unless he worked there. So Mr. McDaniel -- one of seven children growing up in Dumont -- started running the Ferris wheel for the Tolves at the age of 13. By 1987, he and two brothers had purchased enough rides to start their own carnival; today they have 22 rides that they take to eight states throughout the season, which runs from April through October.</p>
        <p>The 37-year-old carnival operator says he loves the business but ''sometimes the red tape kills me.''</p>
        <p>''It's a very difficult business,'' Mr. McDaniel said. ''We get hit by everything -- transportation laws, the D.O.T., electrical inspections, fuel costs, food safety. We have to deal with so many people and we're at the center of it all.''</p>
        <p>Each time one of Mr. McDaniel's carnivals sets up, a battery of local and state inspectors is there to check out the site. ''We know our rides,'' he said, insisting that such familiarity with all the parts makes the  rides safer than those found in fixed parks. ''I take them up and break them down every week. I'm putting the same pins in the same holes every week, so we can see if there's a problem.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the operators' intimate knowledge of the rides, most of the larger carnivals have electricians and mechanics who are called in when a problem occurs.</p>
        <p>It is four hours before the opening bell for the carnival at St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church in Cinnaminson, one of 580 carnivals to take place in New Jersey this season and the largest carnival in South Jersey. Using ropes and pulleys, three ride operators lift a large purple turban panel and place it on the center of the spinning axle on the 1001 Nachts ride.</p>
        <p>Other lighted panels and the row of rotating seats need to be attached before the ride can function. The shirtless, tattooed operators are sweating heavily.</p>
        <p>Across the schoolyard, Abdur Mohammed is polishing the antique carousel's brass posts where the ponies slide up and down; it is the last step in a tedious process he began at 5 a.m., assembling this complicated piece of machinery.</p>
        <p>''This ride has 295 parts,'' said Mr. Mohammed, 50, who has been running the carousel for Amusements of America for the last nine years. ''I've put it together all kinds of ways, but I always make sure it's safe.''</p>
        <p>Riding around the lot on a golf cart is Morris Vivona Sr., the 79-year-old owner of Amusements of America who still spends half his year traveling with this carnival from northern New York state to Florida. Born in Newark, Mr. Vivona and his four brothers got started in the carnival business in 1939, when he accompanied his father to the New York World's Fair as it was closing and offered to buy the Ferris wheel.</p>
        <p>The Vivonas' first show was in Irvington, when they set up their ferris wheel and their father's frozen custard stand across the street from the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. Since then, it has grown to 150 rides playing in more than 150 different places each year.</p>
        <p>The company bills itself as ''the world's largest traveling amusement park,'' a distinction awarded to Amusements of America by the Guinness Book of World Records in 1995.</p>
        <p>Despite becoming a well-established industry, Mr. Vivona and other carnival operators say they still face the ''carny'' image -- that of hard-living gypsies, pitchmen and grifters looking to clean out the pockets of suckers and steal men's wives.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes you go into the stores and local people will look at you and say, 'You're with the carnival,' '' Mr. Vivona said ''But we leave a lot of money behind when we come into town. Our people have to eat, they go to the supermarket, they do their laundry, they buy fuel.</p>
        <p>''This business has cleaned up considerably,'' he went on. ''Years ago, carnivals featured girlie shows, freak shows, gambling was permitted. Today you don't have any of that. We're a legitimate business.''</p>
        <p>H IDDEN behind the painted fun house walls, a small village of overnight housing is erected at each stop along the Amusements of America route. This is where the carnival workers sleep, with senior staff members getting their own trailers, while ride operators sleep 12 to a bunkhouse, complete with showers. These accommodations are a vast improvement over the way carnivals traveled in the past, when workers slept in the ''opossum belly'' of the ride -- the empty cavity beneath the ride.</p>
        <p>Every carnival worker has a different reason for joining the carnival. Some -- like  Mr. Mohammed -- appreciate the pay and a  schedule that allows him to return home to North Carolina for a long winter. Others, like Jerry 'Popeye' Janus, just want to get away.</p>
        <p>''I do it because it calms me down,'' said Mr. Janus, who operates several kiddie rides for Amusements of America. ''It's like a vacation away from the family so that when I do go home, we don't fight so much.''</p>
        <p>Unlike the large amusement parks, where the paths are constantly swept clean and all the workers wear matching uniforms and smiles, carnivals and the people who work them have a certain gritty, throw-back quality that patrons either relate to or find offensive.</p>
        <p>''You either love the carnival or you hate it,' said Mr. McDaniel, now in his 24th year with the carnival.</p>
        <p>You hate it, he said, because ''your daughter ran away with a carny, or your son went off and got drunk with the carnies.''</p>
        <p>But you love it, he mused, ''because it's exciting. It gives you that magic feeling when you walk onto the lot, the lights and the music make you feel good. You can get away from your problems. And for that one night you can say you made your kids happy.''</p>
