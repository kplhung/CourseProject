        <p>For years, the pattern here was as reliable as sunrise. Democrats and Republicans went at each other hammer and tongs, hurling verbal bombs, delaying budgets for months, barely speaking to each other and tying unrelated issues together until most of them collapsed in recriminations.</p>

The legislative session that wound to a close Friday had its bloody episodes, but they were Republican against Republican and Democrat against Democrat, with remarkably little partisan carping.

        <p>For years, the pattern here was as reliable as sunrise. Democrats and Republicans went at each other hammer and tongs, hurling verbal bombs, delaying budgets for months, barely speaking to each other and tying unrelated issues together until most of them collapsed in recriminations.</p>
        <p>Not this year. The legislative session that wound to a close Friday had its bloody episodes, but they were Republican against Republican and Democrat against Democrat, with remarkably little partisan carping. And it ended with an extraordinary number of agreements on big issues, making it not only the most amicable but by far the most productive session since well before George E. Pataki became governor five and a half years ago.</p>
        <p>''It's been a spectacular session for the people of this state,'' a tired but beaming Mr. Pataki said Friday.</p>
        <p>Friday morning, the Assembly and the Senate ended days of squabbling over petty procedural issues and passed a hate crimes bill that the governor said he would sign. In the last few days, the Legislature and the governor struck deals on the furthest-reaching package of gun controls anywhere in the country, on a sweeping revision of sexual assault laws, on a new money-laundering law, on a broad package of school safety measures that includes fingerprinting and background checks of school employees, on making doctors' malpractice records available to the public, and on and on.</p>
        <p>Even before the mad rush to the finish, the lawmakers had set down landmarks. In December, they agreed to an ambitious plan to provide health insurance to the working poor, paid for by doubling the cigarette tax.</p>
        <p>This year, New York became the first state in the country to require fire safety standards for cigarettes, the first to restrict where companies can sell or trade the ''pollution credits'' they earn and the second to phase out a gasoline additive that has caused ground water pollution. Another bill gives retired state workers annual pension increases for the first time.</p>
        <p>''All of these things that people have been fighting for and dreaming for years would happen suddenly happened -- boom!'' said Blair Horner, legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group.</p>
        <p>That list amounted to a string of victories for the governor, a Republican, and the Democratic majority in the Assembly and their speaker, Sheldon Silver. For Mr. Pataki, the year's achievements raised his national profile, enhanced his reputation as a social moderate who is tough on crime, and attached him to several popular issues as he considers whether to run for a third term in 2002. The Assembly Democrats gave ground on a few criminal justice areas, particularly sexual assault and school violence, but also won passage of major measures on hate crimes, cigarette flammability and pesticide notification that they had sought for years.</p>
        <p>For the Republican majority in the Senate, it was a more mixed result, and the verdict will not be known until the November election.</p>
        <p>What most of the prominent bills passed this year have in common is that they moved state policy significantly to the left -- much further than the Senate Republicans had been willing to go before. Worried about their prospects in November, they have been eager all year to shore up their standing with moderate voters, particularly in the suburbs, and that has meant approving bills that made many of them unhappy.</p>
        <p>Their internal struggle over that shift was laid bare early Friday when the Senate Republicans, their hand forced by the governor's push for gun control, finally voted on the matter after struggling for months to establish their position. Of the 20 upstate Republicans, only the majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, voted for the bill, which they clearly wished had never come before them, while the downstate Republicans voted, 16 to 1, in favor.</p>
        <p>The vote Friday morning on disclosing doctors' malpractice records also had them deeply divided, 19 in favor and 17 against.</p>
        <p>Amicability between the parties was a theme this year. A month ago, Mr. Silver could have criticized the governor for vetoing the first version of the fire-safe cigarettes bill. Mr. Bruno and Mr. Pataki could have berated Mr. Silver for resisting tougher penalties for sex crimes. Mr. Silver could have taken after Mr. Bruno for dragging his feet on gun control. But they did not.</p>
        <p>In previous years, they would have taken those shots, and the temptation must have been great this year. Mr. Bruno looked vulnerable early in the year, when he was feuding with the governor, and many Republicans believed Mr. Pataki was trying to foment a coup against the Senate leader. Mr. Silver was perhaps even more vulnerable last month, when the second-ranking Assembly Democrat, Michael J. Bragman, the majority leader, tried to overthrow him.</p>
        <p>''I guess we were all too busy shooting at our own people,'' said Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat. ''Just so many bullets in the gun.''</p>
        <p>Everyone refrained from taking advantage of those weaknesses. ''The opportunity was there to create some partisan chaos, but I think that would have been at the expense of getting principled changes at the end of the day,'' Mr. Pataki said in an interview. In trying to get his way, he said, he had to have an evolving sense of ''what's going to be most effective at achieving the end result.''</p>
        <p>Heading into the 1996 and 1998 elections, the governor worked hard to whittle down the Democratic majority in the Assembly, in part by attacking and embarrassing them publicly over legislation. But each time, the Democrats gained seats, and he may have concluded that the strategy was pointless.</p>
        <p>Some Assembly Democrats say that the attempted coup in their house may have contributed to this year's productivity. They argue that Mr. Silver was forced to loosen his tight control over legislation and, under pressure from the members, rely less on stalling as a negotiating tactic. And Mr. Silver and many of his allies may have felt, after surviving the coup, that they needed tangible achievements to show both their Assembly colleagues and the voters back home.</p>
        <p>''It's been a good year,'' said Senator Kemp Hannon, a Republican from Nassau County. ''But it was hard getting here.''</p>
