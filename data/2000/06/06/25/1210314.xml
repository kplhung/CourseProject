        <p>I can only beg indulgence for opening a sporting commentary with the most venerable of professorial conceits: a quotation from the classics.

        <p>Often, we highlight these caricatures by pairing the poles with rhyme or alliteration as well -- as in nature vs. nurture for the origin of our behaviors, or brain vs. brawn for the sources of manly success: strength for the warrior and the athlete; smarts for the scholar and the tycoon.</p>

        <p>I can only beg indulgence for opening a sporting commentary with the most venerable of professorial conceits: a quotation from the classics. Nearly 2,500 years ago, long before Mr. Doubleday didn't invent baseball in 1839, Protagoras characterized our lamentable tendency to portray all complex issues as dichotomies of us against them: ''There are two sides to every question, exactly opposite to each other.''</p>
        <p>Often, we highlight these caricatures by pairing the poles with rhyme or alliteration as well -- as in nature vs. nurture for the origin of our behaviors, or brain vs. brawn for the sources of manly success: strength for the warrior and the athlete; smarts for the scholar and the tycoon.</p>
        <p>Discerning sports fans do not carry this dichotomy to the extreme of regarding their athletic heroes as pervasively deficient in mind, as if God had given each person just so much oomph, thus requiring that an ounce of intellect be rendered back for each ounce of muscle added on. Rather, we tend to characterize the mental skill of athletes as an intuitive grasp of bodily movement and position -- a ''physical intelligence,'' if you will. Thus we do recognize a mental component in DiMaggio's grace, in the beautiful and devastatingly effective motions of Michael Jordan or Muhammad Ali and even in the sheer force of Shaq pushing through to the basket. (Perhaps no one can stop 300 pounds in acceleration, but the big man still has to know where he should end up.)</p>
        <p>This fallacious belief in the intuitive and physical nature of athletic mentality may best be summarized in the common sports term for a player on a roll of successive triumphs at bat or basket: ''He's unconscious!''</p>
        <p>On the other side of the same misconception, we often blame the intrusion of unwanted consciousness when a fine player, after many years of professional success, encounters a glitch in performing the ordinary operations of his trade. Thus, when Chuck Knoblauch ''freezes,'' and suddenly cannot execute the conventional flip to first base, we say that his conscious brain has intruded upon a bodily skill that must be honed by practice into a purely automatic and virtually infallible reflex.</p>
        <p>I do not regard this conventional view as entirely wrong, but I do think that, for two major reasons, we seriously undervalue the mental side of athletic achievement when we equate the intellectual aspect of sports with unverbalizable bodily intuition and regard anything overtly conscious as ''in the way.''</p>
        <p>First, one of the most intriguing, and undeniable, properties of great athletic performance lies in the impossibility of regulating certain central skills by overt mental deliberation: the required action simply doesn't grant sufficient time for the sequential processing of conscious decisions. The defining paradox, and delicious fascination, of hitting a baseball lies most clearly within this category.</p>
        <p>Batters just don't have enough time to judge a pitch from its initial motion and then to decide whether and how to swing. Batters must ''guess,'' from the depths of their study and experience, before a pitcher launches his offering; and a bad conjecture can make even the greatest hitters look awfully foolish, as when Pedro Martinez throws his change-up with the exact same arm motion as his fastball, and the batter, guessing heat, has already completed his swing before the ball ever lollygags across the plate.</p>
        <p>Indeed, such mental operations cannot proceed consciously and sequentially. But these skills do not therefore become a lesser form of intellect confined to the bodily achievements of athletes. Many of the most abstract and apparently mathematical feats of mind fall into the same puzzling category.</p>
        <p>For example, several of history's greatest mental calculators have been able to specify the algorithms, or rules of calculation, that they claim to use in performing effectively instantaneous feats, like specifying the day of the week for any date in any year, no matter how many centuries past or future. But extensive studies show that these calculators work too quickly to achieve their results by any form of conscious and sequential calculation.</p>
        <p>Second, the claim that Knoblauch's distress arises from the imposition of brain upon feeling (or mind upon matter) represents the worst, and most philistine, of mischaracterizations. Yes, one form of unwanted, conscious mentality may be intruding upon a different and required style of unconscious cognition. But we encounter mentality in either case, not body against mind. Knoblauch's problem takes the same form as many excruciating impediments in purely mental enterprises with writer's block as the most obvious example, when obsession with learned rules of style and grammar impedes the flow of good prose. And we surely cannot designate our unblocked mode as less intellectual merely because we cannot easily describe its delights or procedures.</p>
        <p>I don't deny the differences in style and substance between athletic and conventional scholarly performance, but we surely err in regarding sports as a domain of brutish intuition (dignified, at best, with some politically correct euphemism like ''bodily intelligence'') and literature as the rarefied realm of our highest mental acuity. The greatest athletes cannot succeed by bodily gifts alone. They must also perform with their heads, and they study, obsess, rage against their limitations, and practice and perfect with the same dedication and commitment that all good scholars apply to their Shakespeare.</p>
        <p>Mark McGwire, endlessly studying the videos of every pitch for every pitcher he will ever face, surely matches a careful scholar checking every last footnote for his monograph of a lifetime. McGwire's mental skill may be harder to verbalize, but not because athletes are stupid or intrinsically less articulate than writers. Rather, this style of unconscious mentality gropes for verbal description in all domains of its operation. In my admittedly limited personal experience, I have found great performers of classical music even less able than ballplayers to articulate the bases for their success.</p>
        <p>And so, to Chuck Knoblauch, a truly fine ballplayer, we can only say: this too will pass. I look forward to seeing you at the stadium on a cool evening in late October. Top of the ninth, two outs, Game 7 of the World Series. Some National League victim hits a grounder to second, and you flip the ball deftly to first for the final out. Yanks win the Series, four games to three. And, following the conventions for scoring baseball plays, this last out  goes down in history with the code for a second baseman's assist followed by a first baseman's putout -- 4-3.</p>
