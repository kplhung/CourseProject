        <p>A FEW months back, with considerable fanfare, Time Inc. started a magazine called Real Simple, aimed, in the words of its founding editor, Susan Wyland, at ''helping you simplify every aspect of your life, your home, food, money, clothes, health, looks, work, family and holidays.''</p>
        <p>Real Simple has had, let us say, a real hard time since it was launched.  Critics complained that it was hard to tell advertisements from content, that it was unfocused, that it was too much like Martha Stewart Living. Last month, Ms. Wyland resigned.</p>

        <p>A FEW months back, with considerable fanfare, Time Inc. started a magazine called Real Simple, aimed, in the words of its founding editor, Susan Wyland, at ''helping you simplify every aspect of your life, your home, food, money, clothes, health, looks, work, family and holidays.''</p>
        <p>Real Simple has had, let us say, a real hard time since it was launched.  Critics complained that it was hard to tell advertisements from content, that it was unfocused, that it was too much like Martha Stewart Living. Last month, Ms. Wyland resigned.</p>
        <p>But I suspect that the real problem with Real Simple has nothing to do with the editor. I suspect that the real problem is that no one in its potential market is remotely interested in reducing stress and detangling life.</p>
        <p>Yes, yes, that's what we all say we're after. But the evidence -- starting with the growing number of people who refuse to leave home without a beeper, Palm Pilot, cell phone (preferably with call waiting) and laptop computer (with extra batteries) -- makes it clear that we really want to be tied in knots.</p>
        <p>And not just knots: bigger knots than the next guy's. Your colleagues are type A personalities? Well, you'll accept nothing less than type AA. Call it stress envy.</p>
        <p>If status in the greedy 1980's was conferred on the basis of how much you had, and in the busy 90's on the basis of how much you had to do, then in 2000 it is awarded on the basis of how hassled you are about what you have and what you have to do.</p>
        <p>''Stress has become the badge of honor of the millennium,'' said Arlene Kagle, a psychologist who practices in Manhattan and in Dutchess County, N.Y. ''It's almost as if we're not allowed to enjoy what we're doing anymore. We're annoyed by what we're doing, as if our lives are getting in the way of something that's more important.''</p>
        <p>We lost the idea of the Sabbath as a day of rest long ago. Now we have lost evenings, nights and weekends as well: we're too busy banking online or buying clothes off the Internet. Then we complain -- that is to say, brag -- that we're just so wound up and tense we can barely sleep: four hours a night at most, and don't be getting me jealous by insisting that you get only three.</p>
        <p>''The thinking goes that you're only important and successful if more people can speak to you than you can deal with,'' said Allen Adamson, the managing director of Landor, a corporate consultancy in Manhattan. ''Who wants to meet with someone who, when you ask what time he's available, says, 'I can see you any time this afternoon'?</p>
        <p>''Lawyers and investment bankers are the most competitive,'' he continued. ''They'll say: 'You think you're stressed? Well, let me tell you about my day.' ''</p>
        <p>Even though he is neither a lawyer nor an investment banker -- actually he's president of the League of American Theater Owners and Producers -- Jed Bernstein would like you to know about his crazy, action-packed day, but he doesn't want to do the talking.</p>
        <p>''Although I might take pride in the fact that I'm putting in my time and working the long hours, it would be embarrassing for me to say so,'' he said. ''It would feel like a point of weakness to say that my status is tied up in the fact that I worked a 19-hour day when you worked only a 16-hour day. And that in itself becomes stressful: how to get the word out without being the one to tell people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bernstein is rare in his discretion. The only thing stressed people dependably have time to talk about is how stressed they are, and what they don't have time for: sex, vacations  or a meal with you.</p>
        <p>''A low-level executive friend of mine said, 'I'd love to have dinner, but I'm so overwhelmed that I can't even think about scheduling it until the middle of July,' '' said Marc Simone, a New York radio and cable television host. ''And I said, 'Call me in the middle of July.' An hour later the chairman of the board of the same company called and said: 'What are you doing tonight? Let's have dinner.' ''</p>
        <p>Most people have never been around anyone as important as that board chairman, Mr. Simone said, ''so they have this soap opera version of it'': entourages, dashing about, phones ringing like Playskool toys. Such people tend to lard their conversations with adverbs. They aren't just stressed; they're very stressed, they're terribly stressed. ''They'll say: 'I'm never home,' '' Mr. Simone said. '' 'I'm never there. You'll never get me.' So they'll give you a cell phone number, and they don't realize that all they sound like is a bookie or a drug dealer. They honestly think if they met Jack Welch, he'd say, 'Oh, I'm never home -- I'll give you my cell phone number.' ''</p>
        <p>What has me concerned is what I think of as trickle-down stress. Last week, as I was putting my 6-year-old daughter to bed, she said: ''I don't think I can sleep tonight, Mommy. I have such a day tomorrow. First I have show and tell, then the boys from St. David's school are coming to visit my class, then I have my knitting class after school, and then at night we're going to the ballet.''</p>
        <p>There was a tiny pause before she brightened and said proudly, ''I think my day is going to be even harder than yours.''</p>
        <p>Yeah? We'll just see about that, cookie.</p>
