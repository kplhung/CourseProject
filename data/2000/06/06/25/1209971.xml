        <p>ONE year ago this month, the nation's major airlines announced that they would make travel more pleasant by improving customer service. Fearing that Congress was about to pass a bill of rights for passengers in response to the increasing chorus of consumer complaints, airline executives pre-empted the government's plans by coming up with their own list of a dozen promises. They vowed to give travelers information about low fares and flight delays. They said they would make a ''reasonable effort'' to feed people who were waiting on runways for hours at a time. They promised to explain frequent-flier rules clearly.</p>
        <p>''Our customers have just about had it,'' Leo F. Mullin, the chief executive of Delta Air Lines, said in a speech last year to the Wings Club, an aviation group in New York. It was time, he said, to ''restore public confidence.''</p>
        <p>Here is what has happened since then:</p>
        <p>Consumer complaints to the Department of Transportation have almost doubled. Virtually every independent measure of customer satisfaction has declined. Lines at airports seem longer, and many travelers say the airlines are not living up to at least some promises.</p>
        <p>Welcome, travelers, to the year of restored public confidence. We hope you have enjoyed the trip.</p>
        <p>The unfortunate truth is that flying on an airplane today, while the safest way to travel long distances, is as unpleasant for many passengers as it has ever been. The strong economy has sent more planes into the air and kept them nearly full, but airport space, the air-traffic control system and the size of airline staffs have all failed to keep pace.</p>
        <p>Following the set of promises, the industry has improved in a number of areas, travel experts say. Airlines respond more quickly to complaints and seem to keep passengers better informed about delays. But the promises have not caused enough improvement to make up for the problems that remain. And because many travelers can cite at least one instance in which the airlines have not followed their own new rules, the industry has managed to raise expectations above the level of service they are providing.</p>
        <p>The inspector general of the Department of Transportation, Kenneth M. Mead, is now studying how well the airlines are living up to their promises. As this section went to press early last week, the Senate was awaiting an interim report. The final version is scheduled for December.</p>
        <p>Already, however, this much is clear: the airlines vowed to improve service, and few travelers think they have. ''People who travel frequently think it's pretty tough out there,'' said Rustin I. Carpenter, vice president and general manager in Boston at American Express Consulting Services, which advises corporations on managing their travel.</p>
        <p>In the American Customer Satisfaction Index produced by the University of Michigan Business School between January and March using telephone interviews, the airlines received lower customer satisfaction scores than any other industry. Their cumulative grade has declined since 1994, the survey's first year. It held steady this year mainly because Northwest Airlines saw its score rebound after it had been hampered by a blizzard last year and a strike in 1998. The scores of most carriers declined.</p>
        <p>Other surveys offer similarly grim news. Since 1998, for example, the percentage of Americans who think the airlines do a good job serving their customers has fallen from 78 to 66, according to Harris Interactive, which conducted a telephone survey of 1,024 adults in April. Travelers' frustration has reached the point that on the day last month that biztravel.com announced an offer to give its customers partial or full refunds when a flight on selected airlines arrives late, its Web site received so many visits that it crashed.</p>
        <p>A major part of the problem, industry executives and analysts agree, is an overburdened air-traffic system. The number of passengers on domestic carriers grew 40 percent from 1989 to 1999, according to the Air Transport Association, the major carriers' trade group. The traffic has increased delays, especially in the most crowded regions like the Northeast. Meanwhile, tighter security rules force people to spend more time in line as travelers in front of them show identification and answer questions about their bags' contents. ''The whole airport process is much worse than it was five years ago,'' said Michael J. Boyd, president of the Boyd Group, an Evergreen, Colo., aviation consulting company.</p>
        <p>Congress recently voted to increase the F.A.A.'s funding by 30 percent, which should help the agency improve air-traffic control technology and alleviate some delays. And the carriers are installing devices in airports that allow passengers who are not checking baggage to print their own boarding passes. Over all, though, few experts expect the crowds and delays to get much better soon. The airlines are unlikely to spend the millions of dollars to enlarge their staffs. And current efforts by government officials and executives to build new runways and airports face the usual resistance from nearby communities.</p>
        <p>None of that is new, however. The promises are new, and the crux of them is a commitment to give passengers better information about everything from fares to delays to frequent-flier rewards. Airline executives say they are doing just that. ''Delta has absolutely lived up to its promise,'' Mr. Mullin, the carrier's chief executive, said in a recent interview. The airline, for instance, now responds to consumer complaints in eight days on average, versus about a month last year, according to a spokesman for the airline, John Kennedy.</p>
        <p>Some travelers say they see a difference as well. ''I've noticed instances where they're saying things clearly and precisely that I'm surprised by and that I don't think I would have heard a couple years ago,'' said Mr. Carpenter, who flies at least once a week. He added, however, that ''I don't think it's moved the needle substantially'' from most travelers' perspective. In fact, some of the promises represented little change for the airlines. Two of the plan's 12 parts -- making provisions for passengers with special needs and treating travelers bumped from a flight fairly -- already existed in the airlines' written ticket contracts, and another four represented only a small change, according to an audit by the General Accounting Office, a government agency.</p>
        <p>A number of other promises are vague enough to leave the carriers  room for fudging. The airlines say they will strive to return lost bags within 24 hours. They also talk of providing ''timely and complete information'' about frequent-flier restrictions and other details, without saying whether the information will appear in the footnotes of a little-read document or more prominently in a monthly mailing, for example.</p>
        <p>The holes in the plans have left the industry's critics and more than a few frequent fliers skeptical that the promises mean much. ''Thus far it's a pretty flimsy showing -- lots of public relations and not much substance,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who has pushed for a law that would fine the airlines for breaking their own rules. ''The airlines are in denial,'' he said. ''They refuse to acknowledge the seriousness of the problem and the breadth of the problem.''</p>
        <p>Most damaging of all, many travelers say they can readily cite a recent instance or two in which the airlines have broken one of their promises. That has aggravated the industry's credibility problem and is one reason that complaints to the Department of Transportation have increased so rapidly, travel experts say. (Another is the newfound ease with which travelers can register their complaints, via the Internet or a toll-free phone number.) ''I wouldn't assume airlines are any worse than last year,'' said Terry Trippler, the airline expert for a travel Web site, onetravel.com, speaking of the spike in complaints. ''Passengers are just more fed up.''</p>
        <p>They often have good reason. In late April, Continental Airlines' Flight 1031 was scheduled to leave Newark for Fort Lauderdale at 12:15. With storms over New Jersey, the flight was delayed. First it sat on the runway for about two hours, said William Friedman, a Fair Lawn, N.J., resident who was on the plane with five family members. Then it returned to the gate, and the passengers got off the plane and sat in the area around the gate for about an hour. After another unsuccessful boarding and more hours of sitting on the runway, the plane finally took off at 9 p.m. and arrived in Florida about 13 hours after the passengers had originally boarded.</p>
        <p>BUT throughout the ordeal, Mr. Friedman said, Continental fed the passengers only the sandwich it had planned to serve on the flight. The uncertainty of when the plane might depart and the lines in the airport made it impossible for passengers to get food during the brief times they were waiting in the gate area, Mr. Friedman said. Recognizing this, a flight attendant asked for more food to be brought on the plane, but a ground supervisor refused, he said.</p>
        <p>''We're not arguing they should have flown the plane in that weather,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''But we went from 11:30 a.m. to midnight with a cheese sandwich. I just felt it was inhumane.'' It also seems to violate one of Continental's 12 promises, which is to make ''every reasonable effort'' to provide food to passengers stuck on planes for hours.</p>
        <p>In general, the policy applies to planes that are stuck on a runway, not those that return to the gate for a time, according to David Messing, an airline spokesman.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Friedman returned home and sent an e-mail to the airline, the response addressed only the delay, not the lack of food. ''They either misunderstood the point or purposely evaded what the real issue was,'' he said. Continental did offer him a $25 voucher, but Mr. Friedman refused it on principle, he said.</p>
        <p>In fact, one of travelers' biggest frustrations is the quality of information they get from airlines, in spite of the industry's promises. A Wednesday-night flight last month on American Eagle, a partner of American Airlines, from Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington to Kennedy Airport, is an example. It was scheduled to arrive at 9:45 p.m. at Gate 40. By 10 p.m., it had not landed, but airport computer screens still showed it as a 9:45 arrival. Agents at Gate 40, working with travelers who were supposed to be on another late flight, said they did not have time to find updated information for the people who had come to meet the plane. American Airlines employees at a nearby gate said they could not help either because American Eagle, and not their airline, operated the flight. Finally, the plane pulled up to the gate at 10:07 -- without the computer screen ever showing it as delayed.</p>
        <p>A J. D. Power &amp; Associates survey suggests such anecdotes are more than just the rare exception. The research firm asked travelers in its most recent annual study of the airlines to rate the accuracy of information given at the gate, and the survey found virtually no improvement in the category over last year. Of the airlines rated the top three in communicating with passengers -- Continental, Southwest and TWA -- only Continental did better, said Michael Taylor, J. D. Power's director of travel services.</p>
        <p>The gate isn't the only problem area, either. The airlines continue to exaggerate the benefits of some of their travel programs by omitting key information from the documents fliers are most likely to read. Delta's misleading frequent-flier rules are typical. In the main section of its membership guide, Delta says passengers flying economy class on Aeromexico receive Delta miles. There are no asterisks next to the statement. But 20 pages later, the footnotes reveal that passengers flying in fare classes G (for groups) and L (which are specially negotiated) receive no miles. ''How does the ordinary person know what that is?'' asks Milton Klein, a retired history professor at the University of Tennessee. He was surprised to return  from a vacation and not be credited for part of the trip. ''Apparently, truth in advertising does not apply.''</p>
        <p>A similar problem crops up on the mileage statement Delta sends each month to 27 million passengers. It neglects to mention that one of the most popular awards -- a trip to Europe -- cannot be used during the summer on the very days most people would want to use it: Fridays, Saturdays or Sundays. Asked about the problems, Kevin F. Pinto, system manager of SkyMiles, said the company would fix them. It is worth noting, though, that Mr. Klein's complaint led Delta to send him a copy of its rules but not to change them.</p>
        <p>The overarching problem is that one year after making their promises, the airlines still seem to lack a basic understanding of how to treat passengers, travel consultants say. The carriers often reply to passengers' letters by restating a policy rather than responding to a specific complaint. Or they install baggage templates halfway between the ticket counter and the gate, forcing travelers whose bags are too big to retrace their steps. As Mr. Boyd, the Colorado aviation consultant, said,  ''Airlines still want to make passengers do business their way.''</p>
        <p>The 'To Do' List</p>
        <p>In June 1999, 14 major United States airlines made a dozen promises to passengers. Here are excerpts from the list issued by the Air Transport Association, the carriers' trade group.</p>
        <p>Each airline will:</p>
        <p>Offer the lowest fare available for which the customer is eligible.  Notify customers of known delays, cancellations and diversions.  Make every reasonable effort to return checked bags within 24 hours.  Support an increase in the baggage liability limit (to $2,500 from $1,250).  Allow reservations to be held or canceled for 24 hours.  Issue refunds for eligible tickets within 7 days for credit card purchases and 20 days for cash.  Properly accommodate disabled and special-needs passengers.  Meet customers' essential needs during long on-aircraft delays.  Handle bumped passengers with fairness and consistency.  Disclose cancellation policies, frequent flier rules  and cabin configuration.  Ensure good service from code-share partners.  Be more responsive to complaints . . . All written complaints are responded to within 60 days.</p>
