        <p>Khadijah Conda, sisterhood's child, is still one one-hundredth of a second shy of qualifying for next month's Olympic track-and-field trials in the 400-meter run. Her college coach, Pat Connolly, says, ''You can't even blink your eye that fast.''</p>
        <p>But both women know that smidgen of time may be the measure of a life; at the world class, where all athletes are gifted and strong, it is a competitor's will, not skill, that makes the difference between winning and going home early. Even Conda is not sure if she has the heart to run so hard she will collapse, retching and seeing stars, then get up and shake it off so she can do it again.</p>
        <p>''Part of me can't quite let go of the dream,'' she said last week without conviction.</p>
        <p>She is barely even talking the talk. Walking the walk came to a dead stop last Sunday, when she quit in the middle of a race. That was an unthinkable act to Willye B. White, the five-time Olympian who sent Conda to the three-time Olympian, Connolly, her best friend, for a year of running dangerously at Radford University in Virginia.</p>
        <p>''We still don't know if that girl is hungry enough, greedy enough, to pay the price to be a champion,'' White said. ''Khadijah hasn't shown the die-hardness, the killer instinct. She was called, but she wasn't chosen.''</p>
        <p>The choosing is not quite over. Next Saturday, at a club meet in Indianapolis, Conda could run the qualifying time of 52.45 seconds and get a spot in the trials, which begin July 14 in Sacramento. Her best time so far is 52.46. She is in physical shape to run well, she said, but it took her most of last week to get her mind on board.</p>
        <p>''I have to keep reminding myself this is something I want,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The energy level in her voice rose as she talked about her current internship with General Electric, which she finds absorbing, and a plan to surprise a sorority sister this weekend by attending her wedding. ''I had told her a long time ago I wouldn't make it because I'd be in training.''</p>
        <p>Conda said she has been bedeviled with ''crazy thoughts.'' She didn't want to disappoint White and Connolly. She felt she had some responsibility to find the limits of her considerable talents. Yet she wanted a life, too.</p>
        <p>''I gave up a year of my life,'' she said. ''I wouldn't change that, but it was a hard year, the first Thanksgiving I didn't spend with my family, the first Mother's Day I wasn't with my mother.''</p>
        <p>Last year, after Conda transferred from Purdue to run for Connolly's Radford team, the three women thought they were a sisterhood heading for this year's Olympics in Sydney. Conda had the ''tools'' -- the leg speed, strength and stamina -- of an Olympic champion. But she needed the kind of intensive, one-on-one coaching that would build her confidence and ignite her competitive fire.</p>
        <p>And Connolly and White needed to find out if Conda was really the one.</p>
        <p>Coaches call it heart, but it is really a desperation to win. Not all athletes care enough about winning to allow the quest to dominate their lives. Nothing burns out coaches faster than an unusually talented youngster who will not embrace pain and sacrifice, who would rather play than pay the price to be the best.</p>
        <p>In their time, Connolly, 56, and White, 60, had been desperate enough to pay the price. White sprinted out of a snake-infested Mississippi cotton field to the 1956 Melbourne Games and eventually won two silver medals. Connolly ran and long-jumped out of an abusive California home to the 1960 Rome Olympics, where she and White became teammates.</p>
        <p>For the past 40 years, the women have considered themselves sisters, supporting each other through births, deaths, four husbands and the tidal shifts in the sports world. The rise of performance-enhancing chemicals and procedures drove both women out of competition; neither wanted to take drugs or compete at a disadvantage against those who did.</p>
        <p>After a long career coaching and mentoring young women for the city of Chicago, White retired; she is involved now in Olympic development. Connolly, who is married to the 1956 Olympic gold medalist in the hammer throw, Harold Connolly, found her calling as an elite coach, especially with Evelyn Ashford, winner of three Olympic gold medals and the former world-record holder in the women's 100 meters. Last year, Connolly took a job as head men's and women's track-and-field coach at Radford.</p>
        <p>It was a hard year, building a new program with subpar facilities. Most of her athletes regarded varsity sports as a beauty and fitness regime. Her family was scattered; Harold was in California, coaching their son, Adam, who had his own Olympic hammer-throwing aspirations. Their daughter was in New York, finishing at Columbia. And then there was Conda: smart, lovely, athletically gifted, a young princess who, her sports mothers thought, would put Radford on the map or break Connolly's heart.</p>
        <p>Conda, who turns 22 tomorrow, was raised in a strict Chicago Muslim home. Her beloved father was a sociology professor before his death. Educational achievement was emphasized; sports was a pastime, tolerated so long as Khadijah did well in school. She accepted an athletic scholarship to Purdue because she wanted to be an engineer. She won Big 10 titles at Purdue but never competed in the National Collegiate Athletic Association championships. Her progress was stalled. Conda and the Purdue track coach had problems.</p>
        <p>White had followed Conda's athletic career since she was a schoolgirl participant in the Willye B. White Foundation's annual gala. White thought that Connolly could do for Conda what she had done for Ashford. But Ashford had been hungry.</p>
        <p>''I must have some hunger,'' Conda said last week as she talked herself into competing in next weekend's Indianapolis race. ''But I'm not sure. Is there a lacking in hunger, did it decrease? Is my dream not as deep as I thought it was? I'm searching my soul.''</p>
        <p>Connolly thinks such introspection, along with Conda leaving Radford for Chicago to take the G.E. job and attend the wedding, shows a lack of desire.</p>
        <p>''If she really wanted to be an Olympian, she would be here working out,'' she said. ''I'm sad. I taught her how to run. She came here and she had never run below 54 seconds before. Maybe it's me. Some coaches can coach fear, like Bobby Knight. I can't do that.''</p>
        <p>In Chicago, White said: ''Pat's the one I'm worried about. She gave the girl everything. I don't want her to think it had to do with her coaching. I told Pat not to talk to the girl till she comes back to school in September, let her marinate, maybe she'll mature, have greater insights. And after what happened last Sunday, I told Pat, 'You can't coach guts.' ''</p>
        <p>Last Sunday, at a college meet in Chapel Hill, N.C., Conda quit in the middle of a race she was losing. She stopped and walked off the course. For White and Connolly, it was a sacrilege.</p>
        <p>''You have to run hard, gut it out, fight to the death,'' White said. ''You have to run faster than you are trained to run, you have to hurt, you can't let anyone beat you.''</p>
        <p>Connolly said: ''I was so disappointed, all I could say to her was, 'Thank you for not insulting me and pretending you were injured.' I really thought she was going to make it, run her heart out and qualify and go to the Olympics as an alternate in the relay, take home a gold and be inspired to train for 2004.''</p>
        <p>A few days after that race, Conda struggled to explain why she had quit.</p>
        <p>''It was the first time since I began competing at 9 that I didn't finish a race,'' she said. ''Before I even ran, I was so discouraged I had to force myself to a place I didn't feel I wanted to be.</p>
        <p>''At first, I thought what I did was my way of telling myself to walk away from all this, a perverted way of trying to take control of my life. Afterwards I thought, this is not control, it's part of battling with inner demons.</p>
        <p>''You know, I learned so much this year. I gained strength. I improved so much as a runner'' -- she was named outstanding female athlete at the Big South Indoors. ''Coach Connolly got me to the N.C.A.A. championships. But when I ran my 52.46, I was sick for a day. Do I want that?''</p>
        <p>By the end of last week, however, Conda's spirits had risen, although she was not sure how much had to do with good feelings about the G.E. job, the wedding festivities and her birthday.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to Indianapolis,'' she said. ''I am trying to muster it up, find out whether I have it or not, do or die.''</p>
        <p>Thelipsite Mandate</p>
        <p>Some 100 e-mails to thelipsite@aol.com called for coverage of the Old Rowers Four (Bill Lenderking, Dave Stookey, John Mullen and Louis Mackall, plus a possible fifth in Mackall's boat) who will launch from the South Street Seaport at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow for an expected four-day pull to the East End of Long Island. As promised, Old Writer One (Robert Lipsyte) will at least be thinking about them as they churn through Hell Gate and Throgs Neck and head up along the North Shore, planning stops at Bayview, Mount Sinai and Mattituck, before cruising home to Shelter Island and the South Fork.</p>
