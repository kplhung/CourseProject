        <p>Shoppers browsing the Internet last Christmas could find models of popular Tag Heuer watches for $325 to $1,000, or roughly 35 percent below their suggested retail price, at Ashford.com.</p>
        <p>Since then, the site has raised prices by more than 20 percent, boasts Kenny Kurtzman, Ashford's chief executive.</p>
        <p>Bragging about price increases may seem crazy, but Mr. Kurtzman, like so many of his Internet brethren, is desperate to reassure worried investors that Ashford, which lost $72 million on $42 million in sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, is on track for a more sustainable future.  And their desperation appears to be bringing an end to the Internet bargains beloved of many consumers.</p>
        <p>Internet retailers are in big trouble. Stock prices have skidded, venture capital has dried up and the public markets have closed their doors to those who cannot demonstrate how they will be profitable soon. Small companies like Toysmart.com, Petsmart.com, and Boo.com have been sold or gone out of business.</p>
        <p>Even the industry giant Amazon.com appears increasingly fragile. Lehman Brothers released a scathing report Friday that called Amazon's situation ''weak and deteriorating'' and advised investors to avoid its bonds. The critique sent the retailer's stock plunging 19 percent, wiping out the last of its gains since December 1998 and punishing other Internet stocks as well.</p>
        <p>To please testy investors, dot-coms are trying numerous tactics -- including employee layoffs, reconceptualizing their businesses and raising advertising and association fees -- to show they can eventually move into the black. But because many Internet product prices were once set beneath cost to lure new customers, the easiest and most obvious step has been to bring those prices back to the real world.</p>
        <p>''The artificial pricing of 1999 is history,'' said Mark Goldstein, chief executive of Bluelight.com, the Web arm of Kmart.</p>
        <p>Merchants in cyberspace have also been encouraged to raise prices because customers so far have shown a willingness to pay somewhat more, providing they get service to match.</p>
        <p>''Our research shows that people are clicking at the higher price range, because they will pay a premium for convenience -- like being in stock now, or excellent customer service,'' said Daniel Ciporin, president and chief executive of Deal Time.com Inc., whose online service allows customers to compare Web merchants' prices.</p>
        <p>There is no official entity that tracks past Web prices, but there is plenty of evidence that online bargains are on the wane. Consumers looking for the popular Sony S550D DVD player in May, for example, would have found a bottom range price of $309 to $323, according to data collected by DealTime. Shoppers doing the same search last week would have found the lowest options ranging from $316 to $338.</p>
        <p>At Buy.com, an online superstore, the ''American Pie'' DVD cost $14.99 at Christmas, but now retails at $17.99, as does the DVD of ''Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' up from $13.99 over the holidays.</p>
        <p>Since prices in earthbound consumer electronics stores have never been so heavily discounted -- Circuit City, for example, sells the Sony S550D for $449.99 -- they are not rising much, if at all.</p>
        <p>Even cyberspace retailers whose product prices have not jumped are raising costs indirectly by increasing shipping and handling fees or reducing special offers. Drugstore.com, for example, has raised its standard shipping fee from $3.49 a package in December to $3.95 today, an increase that Peter Neupert, its chief executive, said was meant to bolster profits rather than cover new costs.</p>
        <p>Online retailers are also cutting back on discount coupons and free extras while adding limits on who gets them: new shoppers only, and just one per household.</p>
        <p>There are, of course, plenty of bargains still to be had on the Web. There are also e-merchants who say they are resisting the pressure to raise prices. Amazon.com, for example, while still profitless because of its continued expansion, has $1 billion in cash on hand and makes money on its average sale, and it insists its pricing structure will not change. ''For our business model to work, we do not need to change our pricing,'' said a company spokesman, Bill Curry.</p>
        <p>Still, if the Lehman report is right, Amazon will burn through that billion by December of this year and will again need to go to the capital markets or find some other way to raise cash. Mr. Curry dismissed the Lehman report as ''hogwash,'' but Amazon appears to be looking for ways to increase cash flow. Starting July 1, for example, Amazon will raise the monthly fee it charges small businesses that sell through its zShops and Amazon auctions from $9.99 to $39.99. Amazon would not say how much additional revenue the increase in fees would bring, but David Schappell, group product manager at Amazon auctions, said the increase occurred because ''the old pricing was so far beneath market standards.''</p>
        <p>Less financially blessed Internet companies, meanwhile, are getting the chance to compete on a more realistic playing field right now, a fact that delights brick-and-mortar merchants whose capital structures never did allow them to support below-market prices and the associated losses. Many cackle that as the market returns to a more normal state, their much larger size will give them a natural price advantage.</p>
        <p>''Ultimately, it's going to be hard to compete on price if the bricks-and-clicks are doing a competitive job,'' exulted Jonathan Foster, chief financial officer and chief operating officer of Toysrus.com, the online arm of the goliath chain. Toys ''R'' Us had $13 billion in sales last year, or 86 times that of its biggest Web competitor, eToys Inc., a heft that should give it great influence in negotiating lower prices from its suppliers.</p>
        <p>Luckily for the e-tailers, Web shoppers are showing themselves to be a bit less the dogged bargain hounds than originally thought. In a May survey, Jupiter Communications Inc., the Internet consulting firm, found that Internet customers were slowly growing less price sensitive. Though 73 percent of the 1,500 people who responded to the survey rated price as the most important factor in their decisions to buy a product, that was down from 80 percent two years earlier.</p>
        <p>Consider, too, that the cheapest price range for the best-selling Nikon Coolpix 990 camera was $819 to $824 in May, according to DealTime, and some 59 percent of consumers using the company's search engine purchased at that price. In June, the price range was the same, DealTime found, but the number of buyers at the cheapest level had slipped to 50 percent, largely because the more expensive cameras were in stock while the less expensive ones had waiting lists.</p>
        <p>''Ultimately, convenience and saving time, which have always been the real advantage of the Internet, will be the most valuable'' assets of the online business model, said Marcia H. Flicker, a professor of marketing at Fordham University.</p>
        <p>The price pressures are also forcing online retailers to figure out more quickly how to recognize their repeat -- and therefore more valuable -- customers and reward them, while avoiding the use of scarce resources on customers who buy only when given money-losing incentives. ''There are people out there that just want to take advantage of deals,'' Mr. Neupert said, explaining Drugstore.com's decision to offer fewer coupons. ''Those are not the customers we want to attract.''</p>
        <p>All of this does not, of course, mean that consumers are becoming completely indifferent to the impact on their wallets and that Internet companies can ignore price concerns. Online sites that have made serving up bargains their sole purpose for being are particularly vulnerable. For the last six months, Renana Myers, of White Plains has bid for goods like yogurt, diapers and paper products on Priceline.com -- a service that allows consumers to negotiate prices with a diverse array of retailers -- before she goes to the supermarket, which has a deal with the online retailer.</p>
        <p>Lately, she has noticed the savings are not so great. ''They have shifted the cost of things like wipes and yogurt upwards,'' she said. ''You have to be very savvy and know the costs in the supermarket if you are going to get a good deal.'' She has been disappointed enough lately that she has considered not bothering to visit Priceline any longer.</p>
        <p>Web retailers are all too aware that there is a limit to how high they can push prices, but profit pressures, already intense, are likely to get rougher soon. Next month, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, an independent agency whose rulings are incorporated into generally accepted accounting principles, is expected to debate and possibly even vote on a recently proposed rule concerning how all retailers calculate ''gross profits.''</p>
        <p>The board is trying to standardize how retail companies account for shipping and handling costs. Although there is great variation across the industry, many of the biggest merchants that operate exclusively online, like Amazon.com and eToys, list such costs under their marketing budgets, a practice that inflates gross margins. The accounting board is likely to call for an end to this practice and instead require businesses to deduct such so-called fulfillment outlays from the costs of goods.</p>
        <p>While many catalog merchants also count shipping by this method, the proposed measure would be of much greater significance to virtual retailers because they do not have any positive earnings and gross margins are the main way investors have found to measure the e-tailers' health.</p>
        <p>Such a rule could cause gross margins to drop to 10 percent from 20 percent at Amazon, and to negative percentages for eToys, PlanetRx and Drugstore.com, according to Holly Becker, an Internet analyst at Lehman Brothers. That could further dismay investors, leading to additional pressure on prices, she said.</p>
        <p>''In the absence of bottom-line earnings, we have been using gross margins to gauge the health of the business,'' Ms. Becker said. ''Companies will do what they can to get margins higher again. That means raising prices or lowering fulfillment costs -- and raising prices is certainly a shorter-term solution.''</p>
