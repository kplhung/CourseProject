        <p>Mark McGwire homered for the sixth time in seven games, the 550th of his career and his major league-leading 28th of the season, helping the host St. Louis Cardinals beat the Los Angeles Dodgers, 6-1, yesterday.</p>
        <p>Alan Benes won his first game in two and a half years, pitching on a day filled with 5 hours 55 minutes of rain delays. The game started 1:06 after its scheduled 2:15 p.m. start, was stopped for 33 minutes after the top of the first and was held up for 3:16 in the bottom of the second.</p>

        <p>Mark McGwire homered for the sixth time in seven games, the 550th of his career and his major league-leading 28th of the season, helping the host St. Louis Cardinals beat the Los Angeles Dodgers, 6-1, yesterday.</p>
        <p>Alan Benes won his first game in two and a half years, pitching on a day filled with 5 hours 55 minutes of rain delays. The game started 1:06 after its scheduled 2:15 p.m. start, was stopped for 33 minutes after the top of the first and was held up for 3:16 in the bottom of the second.</p>
        <p>McGwire, who passed Mike Schmidt for sixth place on the career list Friday night, hit a two-run homer in the first off Orel Hershiser (1-4) after a single by J.D. Drew.</p>
        <p>McGwire has homered in three straight games, giving him 103 homers and 219 runs batted in in 214 career games at Busch Stadium.</p>
        <p>Benes (1-0) won for the first time since July 15, 1997, allowing one run in three innings of relief. He missed two and a half seasons because of shoulder injuries.</p>
        <p>BREWERS 2, BRAVES 1: Jamey Wright outpitched Greg Maddux to win his third straight start for visiting Milwaukee.</p>
        <p>Wright (4-1) scattered five hits, struck out seven and walked five in eight innings. He has won his last five starts against the Braves and improved to 3-0 at Turner Field despite entering with a 6.17 earned run average in two previous starts in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Bob Wickman pitched the ninth for his 10th save in 11 opportunities.</p>
        <p>Maddux (9-2), who pitched his third complete game, had won five straight decisions and had not lost since Los Angeles beat him, 4-1, on May 3. Maddux gave up six hits, walked one and struck out five.</p>
        <p>Jeromy Burnitz gave Milwaukee a 2-1 lead in the fourth with his 15th homer, a 454-foot shot to right field -- the longest in Turner Field history.</p>
        <p>Andruw Jones hit a homer off Wright into the left-field seats to give him 100 for his career -- the fifth-fastest player to reach the mark.</p>
        <p>MARLINS 7, CUBS 4: Preston Wilson homered twice, including a three-run drive off Rick Aguilera in a five-run eighth inning, as host Florida rallied for its eighth victory in 10 games.</p>
        <p>Wilson's homer put the Marlins ahead, 6-4, giving him his first multihomer game of the season, the second of his career.</p>
        <p>Derrek Lee followed with his second homer of the game. It was the first time two Marlins homered twice in the same game.</p>
        <p>With the Cubs leading, 4-2, Dave Berg began the rally with a one-out double off Tim Worrell and scored on Mark Kotsay's R.B.I. single off Felix Heredia (3-2).</p>
        <p>Cliff Floyd walked, Aguilera relieved and Wilson hit his 16th homer of the season.</p>
        <p>Aguilera blew a save for the fifth time in 20 chances.</p>
        <p>Joe Strong (1-1), Florida's 37-year-old rookie, pitched one-third of an inning for his first victory.</p>
        <p>GIANTS 13, ASTROS 4: Jeff Kent had four hits, including two in visiting San Francisco's seven-run third inning, and Doug Mirabelli had a career-high five hits for the Giants.</p>
        <p>San Francisco had 22 hits, its highest total since June 12, 1999, against Seattle and the most off Houston since July 15, 1996, at Florida.</p>
        <p>Shane Reynolds (6-4) was pounded for eight runs and 10 hits in two and two-thirds innings, his shortest outing since last Sept. 20 at Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Mirabelli went 5 for 6 with a three-run homer, and Ellis Burks tripled, homered and scored three runs.</p>
        <p>Ramon Martinez tied a career-high with three hits and drove in three runs as San Francisco won for the eighth time in 11 games.</p>
        <p>Astros shortstop Tim Bogar made his second relief appearance of the season and allowed J.T. Snow's ninth-inning homer. Bogar pitched a 1-2-3 inning June 10 at San Diego in a 13-3 loss.</p>
        <p>Kent, who went 4 for 6 to raise his average to .344, leads the N.L. with 71 R.B.I. Barry Bonds was the only Giants starter without a hit, going 0 for 3 with three walks.</p>
        <p>PHILLIES 8, EXPOS 1: Randy Wolf pitched seven strong innings and visiting Philadelphia scored six times in the seventh inning.</p>
        <p>Wolf (7-4) scattered six hits and allowed just one run, on Vladimir Guerrero's R.B.I. single in the sixth, as the Phillies won for the seventh time in nine games.</p>
        <p>Carl Pavano (8-4) allowed two runs in the first on Bobby Abreu's R.B.I. double and Scott Rolen's sacrifice fly. Pavano then shut out the Phillies for the next five innings before leaving the game after the sixth with the Expos trailing by 2-1.</p>
        <p>REDS 11, PADRES 5: Barry Larkin homered twice and had a career-high five hits as host Cincinnati won for only the fourth time in 17 games.</p>
        <p>The victory kept Cincinnati seven and a half games behind St. Louis in the N.L. Central. The June slump has left the Reds with their biggest deficit since they finished the 1998 season 25 games out.</p>
        <p>The Reds scored five runs in the second inning, then coasted. Larkin was the catalyst, scoring four times to match his career high.</p>
