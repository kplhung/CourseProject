        <p>A Rochester man died of meningitis two hours after his flight from Israel landed at Newark on Friday, and authorities were notifying the plane's other passengers yesterday that they may want to seek treatment.</p>
        <p>When the man, Joseph Ferraro, 20, a third-year student at the Rochester Institute of Technology, arrived at Newark International Airport aboard El Al Flight 17 from Tel Aviv about 5 p.m., airline workers told Port Authority police that he needed medical help. Paramedics took him to Beth Israel Medical Center in Newark, where he was pronounced dead at 7:07 p.m., officials said.</p>
        <p>Rita Manno, director of communications for the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services, said yesterday that federal and state health officials were trying to contact the 13 passengers who sat closest to Mr. Ferraro on the flight. Officials were also trying to locate about 90 students, adult chaperones and interpreters who had traveled with Mr. Ferraro on a tour of Israel. Most of them have returned to the United States, said officials, who wanted to encourage those 90 to seek preventive medical treatment in case they had been exposed to bacterial meningitis, the disease that killed Mr. Ferraro.</p>
        <p>Forty-one of the people in the tour group, including Mr. Ferraro, were students from colleges in the Rochester area whose 10-day trips had been sponsored by Hillel and Birthright Israel, both Jewish cultural groups. They were accompanied by three advisers and three interpreters for several deaf students.</p>
        <p>Nine of the students decided to extend their stay in Israel, and Mr. Ferraro had planned to do that, too, until he fell ill, said Ellie Rosenfield, a trip chaperone and an associate professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology. By last night, all of the group except two students had been told of Mr. Ferraro's death and had been advised to get tested, Ms. Rosenfield said.</p>
        <p>About 40 students and two advisers from Drexel University in Philadelphia formed the other half of the tour group, and Hillel was trying to contact them, she said. ''I've been fielding calls from 6:30 this morning,'' Ms. Rosenfield said. ''The kids are devastated. Joe was a magnificent person and a great part of the trip.''</p>
        <p>Doctors determined that Mr. Ferraro died of meningococcal meningitis, a bacterial infection of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord, officials said.</p>
        <p>Bacterial meningitis is life-threatening if not detected in the early stages. It is contagious, but it is spread only through intimate contact with an infected person, like kissing, using the same eating utensils or drinking out of the same cup, health officials said.</p>
        <p>High fever, headache, and stiff neck are common symptoms of meningitis, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The symptoms, which can also include nausea, vomiting, confusion and sleepiness, can appear within an hour of infection or up to two days after, according to the C.D.C.</p>
        <p>Ms. Manno said health officials were assuring passengers that their risk of infection was low.</p>
        <p>''We have no reason to believe the people sitting around him have the disease,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferraro woke up on Friday morning complaining that he had the flu, Ms. Rosenfield said. On the flight, several doctors gave him antibiotics and intravenous fluids, and his headache seemed to be disappearing. When the group got off the plane, the doctors told airport officials that Mr. Ferraro might be contagious, Ms. Rosenfield said, but the authorities let the group leave rather than detain them at customs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferraro had been majoring in film and video. He graduated from West Irondequoit High School and lived in Irondequoit, a suburb of Rochester, with his grandfather and his mother.</p>
        <p>Two neighbors, John and Caroline Swereda, heard of Mr. Ferraro's death from Irving Gordon, his grandfather, who showed up on their doorstep last night, said Mrs. Swereda.</p>
        <p>''He was a very nice kid,'' she said. ''He was always coming over and asking my husband if there was anything he could do'' to help with Mr. Swereda's car.</p>
        <p>She said Mr. Gordon and Mr. Ferraro's mother, Doreen Ferraro, were in Newark to bring Mr. Ferraro's body home.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 27, 2000, Tuesday  An article on Sunday about Joseph Ferraro, who died of meningitis on Friday after arriving at Newark International Airport on a flight from Tel Aviv, misstated his educational background. Although he did attend West Irondequoit High School, near Rochester, he did not graduate.</p>
