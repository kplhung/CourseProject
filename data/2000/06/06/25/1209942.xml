        <p>The Colored Garden</p>
        <p>By O. H. Bennett.</p>
        <p>Laughing Owl, paper, $12.50.</p>
        <p>In O. H. Bennett's affecting first novel, 9-year-old Kenneth Willis's mother abandons his father, an Army officer, in Germany and heads back, kids in tow, to her ancestral home in Kentucky -- it's a place where the boy's grandmother, Ruth, tends an ancient cemetery known as the ''colored garden.'' The garden functions as a kind of repository for the harsh history of slavery and sharecropping on the former tobacco plantation where the family still lives. Kenneth, who is known as Sarge, is brand new to America, and he begins his racial education by listening to his grandmother's tales of people like Cakes Huntley, the son of a slave and a slave owner, who was the color of a ''fried corn cake.'' Cakes dared to dream of becoming a ''gentleman'' and was whipped mercilessly by his biological father for his presumption. The most important story lies under a stone cherub with the mysterious inscription: ''Kate: Born and Died the Same Week. 1931. 'Budded on Earth to Blossom in Heaven.' ''It's the one tale that Sarge's grandmother doesn't want to share. This novel shows how the hidden history of a family, once unearthed, can forever change a person's view of himself and his relatives. In the end, Sarge learns ''more than even my youthful curiosity wanted to know.''</p>
