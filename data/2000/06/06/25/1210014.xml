        <p>AMERICANS still patriotically smarting at the number of British prizewinners in this year's Tony Awards need only visit the British capital itself to find a salve for sore pride. If the New York theater sometimes looks a bit like Shaftesbury Avenue-by-the-Hudson, there are parts of London this summer that might be Broadway-on-the-Thames or even Hollywood-Near-the-Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Revivals of David Mamet's ''Speed the Plow,'' Arthur Miller's ''All My Sons'' and Tennessee Williams's ''Orpheus Descending,'' the British premiere of Mr. Miller's ''Mr. Peters's Connections,'' adaptations of ''Singin' in the Rain'' and ''Baby Doll'': all are now or soon to be found at addresses ranging from the Royal National Theater to the Albery to the chic little Almeida. Moreover, Kathleen Turner's Mrs. Robinson is still doing a sedate striptease for her 20-ish lover in a version of ''The Graduate'' that feels it can advertise itself as ''the hottest ticket in the country.'' And Ms. Turner is not the only Hollywood star in London; Donald Sutherland has just moved his lanky frame into the Savoy.</p>
        <p>Let me not overstate the case. As I'll be reporting in a moment, the London theater is offering some striking non-American plays and performances this summer. A gruff, tough Vanessa Redgrave is aggressively pacing Shakespeare's Globe as the first female Prospero any critic can recall. Alex Jennings is a tense, tormented Albert Speer in an adaptation of Gitta Sereny's fine biography of Hitler's favorite architect; Ralph Fiennes makes a chilling if limited Coriolanus; and a pair of more or less unknown Irish actors take 13 roles in a marvelous two-hander by a more or less unknown Irish dramatist named Marie Jones.</p>
        <p>Yet an image that nicely exemplifies London's trans-Atlantic drift embraces cascades of silver hair, an unnervingly loopy smile and a marked North American accent. Whether he's firing a shotgun at the journalist he has forgotten he's invited, or parading his paranoia and narcissism in purely verbal ways, it's hard to resist the quirky charisma that Donald Sutherland brings to the role of an eccentric Nobel Prize winner in Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt's ''Enigmatic Variations.'' The problem is the French author's play, a succession of surprises that momentarily raise the eyebrows but are likely to leave disbelieving frown lines on the forehead.</p>
        <p>John Rubinstein's earnestly self-effacing Erik Larsen has come to interview Mr. Sutherland's Abel Znorko on his private island off the Norwegian coast. At first, the great man deals condescendingly with questions about whether his new epistolary novel is based on fact -- ''I'm a writer, not a Xerox machine'' -- but then he abruptly and none too explicably reverses himself. Actually, the book consists of the myriad love letters he continued to exchange with a woman with whom he had long ago had a rapturous affair: ''Lightning struck, everything exploded, night became day, and we were asleep in each others' arms.''</p>
        <p>Is that really the way Nobel laureates speak? When Mr. Sutherland's Znorko proceeds to muse about the ''existential alienation of closeness,'' to bemoan the ''single unifying spasm'' that takes lovers ''back to solitude,'' and to claim that he ''imposed separation so our love could be eternal,'' it's almost as if Sartre were composing a bodice-ripper. But that's far from the last of the evening's incongruities. I had better not reveal the twists of plot that follow, if only because the play, which has already been seen in Los Angeles and Toronto, could yet get a New York showing. They did, however, leave my head feeling the way my body might if an over-ambitious osteopath tried to convince me that my knees were for sitting and my elbows for walking: twisted way out of true.</p>
        <p>Let's just say that if Hamlet's letter to Horatio describing his encounter with the pirates turned out to have been written by the dead Ophelia, or if the correspondence between the sexual predators in ''Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' had been penned by Cardinal Richelieu and the Pope, it would be emotionally more revealing and not vastly more preposterous. Still, those with the gift of credulity will get their rewards. They won't find great depth or density in Mr. Sutherland's performance, but they will see his arrogantly upright Znorko become interestingly uncertain of himself: a transition akin to the Tower of Babel turning into the Leaning Tower of Pisa.</p>
        <p>That is just one of several startling mutations to be found on the London stage right now. Indeed, if I had to pick out a best performance for June, I would be hard put to choose between the 13 given by Sean Campion and Conleth Hill in the Belfast-born Ms. Jones's ''Stones in His Pockets'' at the New Ambassadors. Both are Irish extras playing tattered Victorian peasants in a period romance being filmed in scenic Kerry. But they have only to give a nudge to their shoulders and their voice boxes -- and lo, we have the movie's fluting American megastar, or a go-getting assistant director from Dublin, or a troubled priest, or a Cockney rigger high on cocaine, or the drunken old codger famous for having played an extra in ''The Quiet Man'' and been called ''wee Mickey'' by John Wayne.</p>
        <p>This is moviemaking entertainingly seen from the stance of those crowd members whose job is to provide an anonymous background to the glamorous doings of the hero and heroine. It is also, and more seriously, pastoral Ireland observed by its losers. Mr. Campion's Jake has just returned to his village after failing to make a fortune in America, and Mr. Hill's Charlie is still reeling from the collapse of his video business. They find it only too easy to obey the director when he brusquely orders them to tug their forelocks or look ''dispossessed'' and ''defeated.'' But their feelings of defeat don't match those of Mr. Campion's Sean Harkin, the poor, goofy extra who is thrown out of his local pub on the orders of a spoiled celebrity and, filling his pockets with stones, walks into the pond once owned and then lost by his father.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jones's ant's-eye view of a Hollywood saga allows her to tackle several subjects: rural deprivation, cultural exploitation, the gap between the feted and the fated, and, perhaps above all, the lure of dreams and the dream-industry. When Mr. Hill, as the priest, says that ''imagination can be a damned curse in this country,'' he is not only explaining a star-struck boy's suicide: he is also placing ''Stones in His Pockets'' in a tradition that extends from Synge's ''Playboy of the Western World'' through O'Casey's ''Juno and the Paycock'' to Brian Friel's ''Translations.'' And though the reek of self-pity sometimes rises from the stage's bare boards, Ms. Jones banishes it in an ending that is unexpected, ironic and refreshingly upbeat.</p>
        <p>Talking of bravura transmogrification, what about Vanessa Redgrave in ''The Tempest'' at Shakespeare's Globe? On she stalks in a patched-up jacket and faded breeches, looking more like a Balkan guerrilla than the gracious magus of theatrical tradition. It is easier to believe that this tall, wizened, growling figure is an exiled duke than it was to accept Mark Rylance as a frolicsome Cleopatra at the same address last year. Equally, you have no doubt that this Prospero has been hardened by 16 years spent warring with the elements and his own resentment.</p>
        <p>Why such gender-bending in a replica of the Jacobean theater where every role was played by a man or boy? Well, years ago Glenda Jackson spoke for many aging actresses when she said, ''Why should I stay in the theater to play the Nurse in 'Romeo and Juliet?,' '' and became a Labor M.P. But you can't accuse Ms. Redgrave of redressing the sexual imbalance in classic English plays just for politically correct reasons. There are artistic gains. For instance, Ms. Redgrave is the first Prospero I have seen who might have nurtured a daughter from babyhood to adolescence. ''A cherubin thou wast that did preserve me,'' she/he reassures Kananu Kirimi's worried Miranda, and, for once, you sense the warmth and tenderness that has sustained this unlikely duo.</p>
        <p>When she is cherishing Geraldine Alexander's ethereal Ariel, too, you feel that Ms. Redgrave is bringing out what Jung would have called the character's anima or feminine side. But this doesn't lessen Prospero's flinty anger or Prospero's pain at renouncing power. Only at the end does the performance soften. I really don't think the duke's mercy should extend to doing a sort of high-five with Jasper Britton's otherwise admirably anguished Caliban. But this silly, sentimental touch must partly be blamed on the director, Lenka Udovicki, who could have battled harder against one of the Globe's built-in dangers: a tendency for actors to ingratiate themselves with groundlings who are milling and chortling just a few yards away.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fiennes, who is still playing a fretful, narcissistic Richard II at the Gainsborough Studios in London's Shoreditch District, changes and doesn't change for the ''Coriolanus'' that has just joined the repertory the Almeida Theater Company is presenting in the same big, bleak, ad-hoc playhouse. The eyes still have their silvery glint. The classic profile is still in place. But something has happened to the nose, which seems to have lifted an inch or two, as if to put Coriolanus at a still greater distance from the smelly mob.</p>
        <p>This built-in sneer, combined with an articulate disdain that often rises to an eloquent contempt, certainly suits the unlovable hero who is prepared to be exiled and join Rome's enemies rather than compromise his conservative credo. The result is a bold, charismatic Coriolanus but one who seems even more monochrome than Shakespeare's original. After all, the mandarin monster dies because his great foe, Linus Roache's Aufidius, calls him ''boy,'' unforgivably exposing his lifelong failure to stand up to his mother.</p>
        <p>Since you can imagine Barbara Jefford's majestically bellicose Volumnia dismissing Boadicea as a bimbo and the Amazons as a bunch of balky schoolgirls, there is every reason for Mr. Fiennes to stress or at least suggest suppressed vulnerability. But not until he yields to her pleas not to destroy Rome, grabbing her hand and kneeling and sobbing, do you sense Coriolanus's inner child; and it's insufficiently prepared for, depriving Jonathan Kent's mostly admirable production of its one big chance of emotional complexity.</p>
        <p>David Edgar is a left-leaning dramatist who has made a specialty of understanding right-wing minds, which is why his masterpiece is probably ''Destiny,'' a 1976 play about the allure of British nationalism. At three and a half hours, his ''Albert Speer'' makes considerable demands on our rumps, minds and political sensibilities, but, as Trevor Nunn directs the play in the National Theater's Lyttelton auditorium, you will surely be impressed by its size, gravity and willingness to ask difficult questions. How could a man with the intelligence, sensitivity and, yes, decency that Gitta Sereny's biography ascribes to Speer have reacted to Hitler's Mephistopheles like some baby-faced Faust?</p>
        <p>A MOMENT after we have met him, Alex Jennings's pale, grim Speer sits brooding in Spandau, the only Nazi imprisoned there to feel the need for repentance. And then come the flashbacks, explaining how he rose from an obscure architect to the designer of the grandiose capital of Greater Germania and then Minister of Armaments. As Speer admits, he was ambitious, excited by power and susceptible to flattery, especially when it came from the Teutonic Charlemagne who had raised Germany from the ashes and treated him like the kindly father he never had. In the 1930's, how many impressionable young men would not have shrugged off occasional rants about ''Jewish Bolsheviks'' or ''Slav subhumans'' from an idealistic patriot who was also solving their Oedipal problems? How many might not do so now?</p>
        <p>That's the question implicitly asked in the play's first half, and it is the more challenging for Mr. Jennings's quiet intensity and the excellent acting of Roger Allam as Hitler, a beguilingly affable figure who gives his true nature away only when paranoia surfaces or when setbacks in the war turn him into a babbling, broken savage, demanding the demolition of Germany itself. The second half, with Speer released from Spandau and restored to the public-speaking circuit, raises a more particular worry. Was Speer telling the truth when he denied any knowledge of the Holocaust? Was his moral redemption a fake, his spiritual regeneration based on a lie?</p>
        <p>The problem with plays like ''Albert Speer'' is that they are circumscribed by the facts as they are known. Fiction may lack historical authority but it brings freedom and freedom's rewards. If Shakespeare had based, say, ''King Lear'' on some druid's definitive biography, he could hardly have produced the fathomless tragedy that imagination allowed. That is maybe why neither Mr. Edgar nor Mr. Jennings can plunge too deeply into the darker side of Speer's raveled, ravaged psyche, but must instead show him obsessively denying that he was present when Himmler announced the Final Solution and repeating his mantra: ''I should have known. I could have known. I didn't know. I turned away.''</p>
        <p>Still, this Speer is bright enough to realize that ignorance may be willed and turning away can itself be a crime, perhaps more heinous than acknowledging complicity and paying the penalty. And at his play's end, Mr. Edgar does take a surely forgivable liberty, bringing on Mr. Allam as the Hitler who still haunts his architect's nightmares. And this Fuhrer is no paternal figure, but a sneering fanatic who points out that he did indeed talk of the annihilation of bolshevism and the destruction of the Jews, and asks, ''Why was I cursed with never being taken literally?'' As Mr. Jennings's dying Speer finally agrees, the phantom had a point -- and it's one that implicates more people than himself.</p>
        <p>Whether New York will see ''Albert Speer'' or ''Stones in His Pockets'' remains uncertain, but both Mr. Fiennes's ''Coriolanus'' and his ''Richard II'' are headed for the Brooklyn Academy of Music in the fall, and other British work will doubtless follow them to the city. But then the coming months will see major revivals of ''Merrily We Roll Along'' and ''My Fair Lady'' in London, as well as Cameron Mackintosh's mega-production of ''The Witches of Eastwick,'' a musical, derived from John Updike's novel, by two young Americans, John Dempsey and Dana P. Rowe. And who takes over from Kathleen Turner in ''The Graduate'' at the beginning of August? Why, Texas's very own Jerry Hall. No, the traffic across the Atlantic is decidedly two-way.</p>
