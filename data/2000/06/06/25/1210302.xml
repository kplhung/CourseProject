        <p>Elementary-school students in Amityville will no longer be kept in remedial math and reading classes for more than two years under a settlement ending a $5 million Federal suit filed last year by the NAACP, the Amityville Teachers' Association and parents.</p>
        <p>The suit argued that since 1998, pupils in Grades 1 through 6 who performed two years below grade level on an achievement test were placed in special classes with an extra math and reading teacher. Those students were not able to take classes in music, computers, social studies and science and were not eligible for the honor role, according to the plaintiffs' lawyer, Frederick K. Brewington of Hempstead.</p>

        <p>Elementary-school students in Amityville will no longer be kept in remedial math and reading classes for more than two years under a settlement ending a $5 million Federal suit filed last year by the NAACP, the Amityville Teachers' Association and parents.</p>
        <p>The suit argued that since 1998, pupils in Grades 1 through 6 who performed two years below grade level on an achievement test were placed in special classes with an extra math and reading teacher. Those students were not able to take classes in music, computers, social studies and science and were not eligible for the honor role, according to the plaintiffs' lawyer, Frederick K. Brewington of Hempstead.</p>
        <p>''There was no way to 'test out' of those classes,'' he said. ''The only way to get out was if your parents complained. Can you imagine being called a 'dumb-dumb' at Grade 1?''</p>
        <p>He also said assignments to the special classes fell disproportionately on children in minority groups, who accounted for 78 percent of the 1,500 youngsters so assigned.</p>
        <p>The lawyer for the school district, Gregory J. Guercio of Farmingdale, pointed out that 85 percent of the 2,500 students in the district are members of minority groups. He called the settlement a ''victory for the school district'' because the suit's claims of discrimination and racism were dismissed.</p>
        <p>Under the settlement, which is effective in September, there will be an annual review of the pupils in the special classes, and no pupil will be kept in the classes longer than two years. The students must also have equal access to subjects like music and art.</p>
