        <p>LIVING TO TELL</p>
        <p>By Antonya Nelson.</p>
        <p>317 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Scribner. $24.</p>
        <p>IN Antonya Nelson's third novel, ''Living to Tell,'' the protagonist is not an individual but a whole family, the Mabies of Wichita, Kan. Their story begins with the wayward son, Winston, flying home to his tight-knit clan after serving a five-year prison sentence for killing his grandmother while driving drunk. Nelson's description of Winston's terror of flying, early on, sets the novel's tone:</p>
        <p>''Winston took a moment to stew about the stewardesses' heft. What if the plane were too heavy to hurl itself smoothly from here to there? What had happened to the regulations that had kept previous stewardesses trim and shapely, role models of anorexic teenage girls, subject matter of male pornographic fantasy? How the hell had these Wide Loads squeaked through flight attendant training?''</p>
        <p>It is hard not to find this neurotic monologue funny. This tone of wry, obsessive observation pervades the novel, almost always overriding the plot's inherent mawkishness, as the characters struggle to work through their difficulties and to grow to understand themselves and one another.</p>
        <p>The family to which Winston returns may live together in relative peace, but they have their fair share of troubles. The elder daughter, Emily, moved home after leaving her cocaine-dealing husband without telling him she was pregnant with their second child; the younger daughter, Mona, is, at the age of 29, sometimes suicidally depressed and given to sleeping with married men (including her sister's former husband). Professor Mabie, the patriarch, is bored in his retirement, going deaf and about to lose his best friend, Betty Spitz, to lung cancer; his wife, going blind, is retreating from the world, unable to accept that she cannot fully know her grown children and jealous of her husband's relationship with Betty.</p>
        <p>Professor Mabie's brother Billy is bossed around by his obnoxious teenage daughter, Sheila, of whom the professor thinks, ''Even her name suggested the seedy, and seemed destined to direct her into a line of work involving</p>
        <p>G-strings and raunchy music.'' Emily's older child, Roy, is prone to tears, and ''refused to let his mother know his dominant hand . . . to settle for left or right. He seemed not ambidextrous, but the opposite, ambi-incompetent: neither one functional.'' Her 8-month-old daughter is (as Mona thinks) ''an ugly child, not one redeeming characteristic to save her, dour, gloomy, coarse-featured, charmless. She comported herself like a Buddha, a toadlike entitled somebody others ought to be grateful to hold and serve.'' So it is no wonder that the return of Winston -- recovering alcoholic, ex-con and killer of the family's beloved grandmother -- does not dominate the novel, but rather weaves right into the fabric of these complicated lives.</p>
        <p>The fact that no Mabie is depicted while alone means that none of them has a monopoly on our attention or sympathy. While Emily complains about Roy's incompetence, Winston enjoys him mightily; while everyone broods over Winston's return, Mona worries more about compulsively checking her (empty) answering machine; and although everyone dislikes Sheila, Mona takes her to a clinic when she needs an abortion, and contemplating Sheila's sex life helps Mona figure out what she might really need from her own. The third-person narration aligns itself first with one character, then another. This fluid point of view permits many avenues of approach to the novel's events; for example, we see Professor Mabie and Billy skulking in to have a drink away from the rest of the family, yet also see how the other family members respect their desire for privacy. Thus when events in the Mabie household turn serious -- Betty dies, Emily is found to have a terminal illness and Mona begins sliding toward a nervous breakdown -- we have enough information, from enough different vantage points, to judge these events for what they are, rather than being blinded by the emotion of a limited point of view.</p>
        <p>OCCASIONALLY the burden of this wealth of information becomes too heavy. Professor Mabie, pondering his inability to converse freely with his two daughters, admits that his trouble is that ''their tastes ran toward the confessional, the conversation, the intensely depressing nerve-racking focus on feelings.'' All the Mabies, himself included, habitually think too much, and as a result, Nelson's exposition of internal states tends to crowd out action and dialogue. Often this self-observation is insightful and funny, but sometimes there is simply too much navel-gazing. Here, for example, is part of Mona's page-and-a-half-long rhapsody about eating:</p>
        <p>''Over countless meals they had sat laughing with the wine bottles standing in the midst of the evening's collapsed debris, initial detritus cleared, plate of desserts, crumbs and spills, odor of roasted meat, sheen of rich balms, butter, gravy, glaze, the pretty bottles and the pretty glasses to hold the pretty liquid, their pretty names, Champagne, Chardonnay, Claret, Merlot, Cabernet, Burgundy, Beaujolais, Pinot Noir. Was there ever a sexier name than Pinot Noir? And after the tall grand green bottles were emptied of their thin liquid, and the tall thin glass stemware drained and smudged and rimmed with waxy lipstick, then came the decorative and more substantial squat decanters, colors amber, gold, maple, with their accompanying tiny sweet tulip bud glasses.''</p>
        <p>It seems unfortunate that the novel, like a complacent nonvoter, never mentions a national or even local event (except for a tornado, which serves exclusively to highlight various family relationships) and pays no attention to anyone outside the family's immediate purview. When so many characters are involved in such obsessive self-scrutiny, the close atmosphere that results can at times induce claustrophobia. However, the moments at which ''Living to Tell'' becomes cloyingly self-involved serve primarily to highlight at how many other moments it does not feel confined. Rather, the characters' self-study leads to true (if incomplete) understanding; and the story's hard-won, moderately happy ending is a satisfying benediction upon this ensemble cast, about which the reader has truly come to care.</p>
