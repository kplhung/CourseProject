        <p>Anglomania: A European Love Affair  By Ian Buruma. Vintage, $14.</p>
        <p>The author, whose Jewish great-grandparents left Bismarck's Germany to settle in England, examines an idea that has taken many forms in the European imagination over the centuries: the idea of Britain. ''His own and his family's story is artfully woven'' through the book, ''making this both a memoir and a work of intellectual history,'' Alexander Stille wrote here in 1999.</p>
        <p>Collected Poems: 1920-1954  By Eugenio Montale. Translated by Jonathan Galassi.  Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $18.</p>
        <p>This bilingual version of the three major books of one of Italy's greatest poets (1896-1981) is filled with verse ''of an unignorable kind'' and features ''Galassi's superb translation . . . and commentary,'' Nicholas Jenkins wrote here last year. Montale was ''an unequaled chronicler of the seedy but meaningful edges of modern life.'' The same publisher has reissued Repair, by C. K. Williams ($12), a Pulitzer Prize-winning collection by an American poet known for his ''exact, bewildering, slant rendering of raw emotion and careful thought,'' as one critic put it in 1999. ''Williams spares neither himself nor the reader anything. This is his singular genius and passion.''</p>
        <p>Eleanor Roosevelt. The Defining Years:  Volume 2, 1933-1938  By Blanche Wiesen Cook. Penguin, $17.95.</p>
        <p>In her continuing account of the iconoclastic, take-no-prisoners first lady, the author ''continues her diligent pentimento, getting at the tender, sprightly creature behind the starchy, strident image, chronicling how the timid housewife . . . shed her chrysalis and turned into the New Deal's relentless 'Eleanor Everywhere,' ''Maureen Dowd wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>Hannibal  By Thomas Harris. Dell, $7.99.</p>
        <p>The third part of the author's horror trilogy about the far reaches of abnormal psychiatry involves a rematch between the intrepid F.B.I. agent Clarice Starling and her nemesis, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a k a Hannibal the Cannibal. Last year our reviewer, Stephen King, called this ''one of the two most frightening popular novels of our time, the other being 'The Exorcist.' ''</p>
        <p>Letters From Yellowstone  By Diane Smith. Penguin, $12.95.</p>
        <p>In 1898, a young medical student and avid botanist becomes the sole woman on a Smithsonian-backed expedition to Yellowstone National Park. Last year one critic called this ''a thoroughly enjoyable, intriguingly offbeat epistolary novel'' with ''a host of memorable characters.''</p>
        <p>The Art of the Moving Picture  By Vachel Lindsay. Modern Library, $14.95.</p>
        <p>In one of the earliest books of serious film criticism, the poet champions the silent films of D. W. Griffith and others. ''He is eloquent in his repudiation of whatever slur there be in the term 'canned drama,' ''the Book Review said in 1916. Lindsay ''has a vision of the nation remade by this new art form which cuts deeper than the newspaper or the public school.'' Modern Library, as part of a series on the movies, has also reissued Agee on Film: Criticism and Comment on the Movies, by James Agee ($14.95), a collection of reviews that originally appeared in Time magazine and The Nation in the 1940's, and several other essays, including ones on John Huston and silent comedy written for Life magazine. ''Each of his reviews brings the movie before you, alive and whole,'' Richard Griffith wrote here in 1958. In Memo From David O. Selznick, selected and edited by Rudy Behlmer ($15.95), the legendary producer of ''Gone With the Wind'' and ''Rebecca'' is given flesh though his voluminous correspondence, primarily his private letters, telegrams and memorandums. ''Selznick was at once a brilliant man and an unmitigated interfering nuisance,'' Charles Higham wrote in these pages in 1972, and his memos ''make harrowing reading.''</p>
        <p>Preempting the Holocaust  By Lawrence L. Langer. Yale University, $12.95.</p>
        <p>In these essays, a scholar argues that the Holocaust was an act of pure evil ''beyond guilt and atonement,'' with no redeeming lessons and without heroes or martyrs, only victims. ''Always thoughtful and provocative, he writes about complex moral issues in a lucid and forceful style,'' Lore Dickstein said here in 1999.</p>
        <p>More Bread or I'll Appear  By Emer Martin. Anchor, $12.</p>
        <p>In this novel about an Irish family struggling to stay connected, a young woman journeys to Japan and Central America in search of her older sister, who fled home 14 years earlier. Her ''odyssey movingly reveals the harm of clinging to the past, even in the name of family,'' Megan Harlan wrote here in 1999.</p>
        <p>The Metaphysical Touch  By Sylvia Brownrigg. Picador USA, $15.</p>
        <p>This first novel uses a weird on-line romance between a lonely graduate student in philosophy and a suicidal, possibly nonexistent, author to explore the nature of being and the intersection of the physical and metaphysical worlds. The result is ''a serious and intelligently wrought piece of fiction,'' Geoff Nicholson said here in 1999.</p>
