        <p>When it comes to nudity, actresses are just like you and me -- self-conscious, vain, insecure, eager to please and sometimes miserable.

And that their families will probably see them. And their friends.

        <p>ROSIE PEREZ (''White Men Can't Jump,'' ''Fearless''): I initially wanted to do this round table because of my stepdaughter, because she told me that there was a Web site where I was nude. And it just brought up a lot of questions, because now that I'm older and married and I have a 14-year-old stepdaughter, and she sees me naked on a Web site, I'm like: How am I going to respond to her? Am I going to say, ''Oh that's a horrible thing''? I really had to go, Wait a minute, do I really feel good about what I did? Do I feel embarrassed in front of her because I did those things? And then I started reaching even further, and I remember there was a point in my career where I actually pulled back, because everybody wanted me to do these movies where I'm taking off my clothes and sassafrassing around, and then I found myself covering up, and I was like, Well, that's not me, either. It's just that the whole entertainment industry forces you to deal with the issue of sexuality, and of your own sexuality. I see explicit covers on magazines, and they're getting even more explicit, and it's like, Are women being empowered, or is this just what sells magazines? Are they feeling pressured, or have they really come into themselves and are saying, ''I am woman, hear me roar''?</p>
        <p>MIM UDOVITCH: Maybe we should start by going around the room and talking about your first, or your most memorable, experiences with doing nude scenes.</p>
        <p>PEREZ: My first experience, of course, was ''Do the Right Thing.'' And I had a big problem with it, mainly because I was afraid of what my family would think -- that's what was really bothering me. It wasn't really about taking off my clothes. But I also didn't feel good about it because the atmosphere wasn't correct. And when Spike Lee puts ice cubes on my nipples, the reason you don't see my head is because I'm crying. I was like, I don't want to do this. I felt like Irene Cara in ''Fame.'' It was like, Wait a minute, I feel so wimpy, this is not who I am. So that was my first experience, and it was horrible. But then I went and took my clothes off again for ''White Men Can't Jump''! But that was because it was totally my decision, I felt totally comfortable, the director was so cool and Woody Harrelson was like, Well, whatever you want is cool with me. So there I felt empowered by it. But with ''Do the Right Thing'' it was like, Now I'm the object, here's the shot. And the reason why I cried was not so much because I felt violated as because I was angry at myself, because I wanted to say: ''Say something! Get up!'' So that's how I felt violated. I felt like I violated myself.</p>
        <p>SARAH JESSICA PARKER (''Sex and the City,'' ''State and Main''): Well, I've never done nudity. And I don't do nudity, and for no particular moral reason. It's not a judgment, and I'm very admiring of those people who feel comfortable enough to do it. The irony is that I come from a very politically progressive family. But I've just never felt comfortable, and I've always felt that I could convince whoever had an idea that nudity might be good in a scene that it wasn't. I was thinking of all these stories -- not that a lot of people try to get me to take my clothes off -- but in a work environment, when it's been discussed, there are some stories that are really awful, and in retrospect I felt that it was good old-fashioned Hollywood sexual harassment, where I didn't realize that was what was happening. Generally speaking, you're the only woman around, there's just men everywhere you look, and one experience in particular, they thought that I was going to do a nude scene the next day, and they started joking about it the night before, saying, ''Oh, tomorrow Sarah Jessica's getting nude,'' and it was very late at night, and everybody was laughing, and I said, ''No, I'm not,'' and they said, ''Yes, you are.'' And then there were phone calls made to my agent, and mean things were said. You know: ''We shouldn't have hired her. We should have hired so and so.'' And I kept thinking, Oh, please God, fire me. I mean the movie was bad anyway. It was a really awful situation. So I didn't do it, but the fellow playing opposite me did -- he was totally nude in the scene, and it was just as awful as it gets. I thought, Well, that's his only means of making me feel uncomfortable now, for him to be nude because he knows that for me this is awkward.</p>
        <p>UDOVITCH: So your contracts specify no nude scenes?</p>
        <p>PARKER: Yes. And now that I'm married, not that there's any kind of dictatorship in the house, but he doesn't even really like to see a photograph that is meant to be titillating or whatever, it makes him feel uncomfortable. And I think I'm much more conscious of that, too, now, like what I do at work, too, even a scene with a bra and skirt.</p>
        <p>SANDRA BERNHARD (''The King of Comedy,'' ''I'm Still Here . . . Damn It''): For me, anytime I've used nudity in my work, I've always felt strangely detached from it, and it's always been on a lot of different levels that it's worked for me, and had sort of a multipurpose emotional and cultural reference. So I've never felt in any way, shape or form exploited or used, because it's always been pretty much my decision. Even in ''King of Comedy,'' where I stripped down for Jerry Lewis, it's such a perfect metaphor for any woman's darkest fantasy. It's always been, I don't know, kind of a kick for me -- having grown up being really skinny and, like, not particularly confident, for me it's always felt really liberating.</p>
        <p>PEREZ: That's how I felt for ''White Men Can't Jump.''</p>
        <p>BERNHARD: But you're a little bit more bodacious than I am, so I'm sure your whole life you've kind of been looked at in a much more sexual way, and ogled. Also, when you do comedy, you're usually alone onstage, so you're calling the shots. And if you're not self-deprecating, you just don't get into that whole sort of I'm-being-completely-exploited-by-the-patriarchy thing. And in terms of my own daughter, we kind of always wander around naked together, so it's pretty open and relaxed. I think it's something I missed growing up. That's not my mother's thing, she's not sexual, so for me it was kind of like a new experience to be sexual and express it through my work. Because in my own life I'm sometimes completely detached from it as well.</p>
        <p>SARITA CHOUDHURY (''Mississippi Masala,'' ''Kama Sutra''): My first time nude was with a woman director, so I thought it would be easy, but it wasn't. I got my period just before.</p>
        <p>DEBI MAZAR (''Goodfellas,'' ''The Insider''): Me, too!</p>
        <p>CHOUDHURY: Really? And so I didn't want to come down from the room -- it was horrific. Usually, though, I feel really comfortable during the scene, and then I hate it when the movie is going to come out. My family is conservative, and that is hard. I don't know why it's so liberating when I'm doing it and then . . . I guess it just shows, and it's weird, that an experience can be normal, but when you think about it in the context of family and tradition, then it's not.</p>
        <p>PEREZ: It's funny. With family I don't know what to say anymore. My father calls, and he says: ''Hello, baby! Do I see this one?'' ''No.'' ''O.K., bye!''</p>
        <p>amber valletta (''What Lies Beneath,'' ''Drop Back Ten''): Well, none of the films I've done were nude. But one of the first modeling jobs I got that was big, that was a break, I got for French Elle -- and in France nudity is not a big deal. I went on the job because one of the two models got sick, and the other one was Claudia Schiffer. Obviously I was kind of the nobody, so she got all the work -- it was a week in the Seychelles, and they were like, Well, we'll shoot a couple covers on you when we get a chance. I was 17, maybe 18, and they asked me to take off my top for one of these pictures. And the picture is of me like this [crosses arms over breasts and freezes] and I look so uncomfortable. I had never taken off my clothes for a photographer before, and he was particularly mean, he was very macho, and it didn't make it any easier. And I kind of regret ever doing that for them, even though the photo never ran, because it was not something I felt good about. I think for one, I was too young, I wasn't even that sexual. Nor did it make any sense for the photo. And since then I have done a few nude pictures and I'm very, very careful about it -- like I know the number of nude pictures that are out. But then there are runway photos that are on the Internet. This one kid came up to me and said, ''Can you sign this?'' And I looked, and it was a totally sheer top -- you could see my breasts like it was broad daylight. And you just never think, because it's for a fashion show, that those pictures might get cut for --</p>
        <p>MAZAR: ''Celebrity Skin''!</p>
        <p>PEREZ: That was the Web site!</p>
        <p>VALLETTA: Actually, I've seen it twice now, so now I'm even careful on runways, but sometimes you just say, ''I don't care, I feel good.'' But the first one was definitely uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>UDOVITCH: The difference maybe is you're in a position now where you can say no, and before you really --</p>
        <p>VALLETTA: I couldn't. I was trying to do a job, and I was with a model who was already made, and she was going to do the picture if I wasn't probably, and maybe not naked, but it would have been one more for her and one less for me. And when you're young and nave . . . it's not that you're not given a choice, but you maybe don't know what your choices are.</p>
        <p>UDOVITCH: Everyone has said that power is an issue. Sandra has said she's the most comfortable, and she's the one who has the most power over what she does. And it's funny that what Sarah Jessica said, about the male actor in the love scene, that male nudity expresses power the other way, you know, it imposes power.</p>
        <p>MAZAR: For me, I basically had hippie parents, and I've always been a very sexual person and O.K. with people seeing my body -- so my first experience being naked, I gave full nudity. I read it, I discussed it with the director, we discussed how we were going to shoot it, it was going to be very Bunuel-like, starting with the tip of my heel, and we had it all mapped out, and I felt, Wow, this is going to be really cool. It was my first big studio lead. It was called ''Money for Nothing.'' It had John Cusack, Benicio Del Toro, all these great actors. And then, at the end of the day, it was completely gratuitous, like they just showed me sitting on him, frontal. It wasn't artistic, it wasn't beautiful, it wasn't even a good angle for me. And I just felt like, Damn, there's really nothing you can do about it, because you never know how they're going to cut it up. Now with love scenes, often if I read a script and I don't trust a director, I have a clause, no nudity.</p>
        <p>PEREZ: That's something that's really bizarre, when you get to that point in the Hollywood system where you have to negotiate certain body parts.</p>
        <p>CHOUDHURY: Oh, completely! It's absurd!</p>
        <p>PEREZ: It's like, No below nipple, no crotch shot, only side, no frontal, or in the frontal, only stomach --</p>
        <p>MAZAR: And no crack. Mm-hmm.</p>
        <p>PEREZ: Right, no crack. They literally have these terms, and you sit there thinking, What the hell is going on? It drives me crazy to the point where I want to say, ''No, you can't show nothing,'' not because I don't believe in it, but because it's so absurd.</p>
        <p>PARKER: It's worth noting that we feel we need protection with this, whereas everything else that we're told as women of a certain generation is, We are as good, we're equal, we can have the whole thing, and we still feel we need somebody, a manager or an agent or a big, burly somebody, to say no.</p>
        <p>UDOVITCH: But then some women who have chosen to take their clothes off, and examples that spring to mind are Demi Moore, Madonna, Elizabeth Berkley, obviously a big range of performers doing very different kinds of work, but they were all clobbered, in a way that it's hard to believe anybody deserves for anything they do in entertainment.</p>
        <p>MAZAR: Did it hurt them? No.</p>
        <p>PARKER: I think it hurt Elizabeth Berkley.</p>
        <p>CHOUDHURY: I think it hurt Demi Moore. I think it hurt her big time.</p>
        <p>UDOVITCH: I think it hurt Madonna in the short term also.</p>
        <p>PARKER: Perhaps it's not fair to prognosticate about Elizabeth Berkley, but it's an easy example in a way. I looked at ''Showgirls,'' and although I don't know what she was thinking, what it felt like in the audience was, she wanted to be in a big movie, and it wasn't good, the script wasn't good. But look how different Gina Gershon was -- she seeemd very self-aware and ironic.</p>
        <p>UDOVITCH: I think Elizabeth Berkley was different in that she was very young, and she just did what the director told her, and as it happened, it didn't work.</p>
        <p>PEREZ: [to Bernhard] What's the matter? Do you not agree, lady?</p>
        <p>BERNHARD: Nothing's the matter. I have nothing to say about ''Showgirls.'' I just think it's a campy, funny film, and I think anybody in that role would have probably been in the same position. It was an asinine role, the film was completely absurd and, I mean, it didn't even capture Vegas.</p>
        <p>But it was brilliant, it was hysterical, it was one of the funniest films I've ever seen! There's no way you can take that movie seriously.</p>
        <p>MAZAR: I went in to audition on that movie. I knew it was [expletive] when I read it, and I thought, Man, I'll go in, and I'll work it, I'll use my sexuality because I can.</p>
        <p>BERNHARD: Did you go in for Gina's role?</p>
        <p>mazar: Yeah. And when I walk into an audition, I do use my sexuality to get a part, to put it out there, to convince them.</p>
        <p>BERNHARD: If you're going in and using your sexuality to get a part, how can you ever get offended if they want you to be nude?</p>
        <p>MAZAR: I don't. But I decide when I get exploited now.</p>
        <p>BERNHARD: That's fair.</p>
        <p>MAZAR: I figure I've done enough movies now that I know angles, I know lighting, I know --</p>
        <p>BERNHARD: It's all about looking beautiful for you, I think.</p>
        <p>MAZAR: No! I look ugly in a lot of movies. I play a lot of charactery parts.</p>
        <p>BERNHARD: I know, I'm just kidding. But if you're gonna expose yourself in that way, you want to be pretty, everybody does.</p>
        <p>PEREZ: I want to be in shape.</p>
        <p>BERNHARD: But there's some point of vanity. To me, the most offensive scene in any movie, nudity-wise, was Michael Douglas in ''Basic Instinct.'' It was like, I can't believe I have to look at this crepey old [expletive]. I mean, that was a broke-down moment.</p>
        <p>PEREZ: I think one of the best examples of nudity I've seen women do in movies is ''Blue Velvet,'' when home-chick came out on the lawn and she's naked. That was where I thought nudity was so appropriate, because this man tormented her and drove her to the point of insanity, so when she walked out on the lawn, you weren't saying to yourself, Oh, my God, Isabella Rossellini's naked, you were saying, Oh, my God, she's finally flipped out, you're so concentrated on her character.</p>
        <p>UDOVITCH: Another thing about Isabella Rossellini in ''Blue Velvet'' is that she looked great when she came out naked, even completely tormented, but what she also looked like was like an un-worked-out body, and at that time, in 1986, you never saw that. In the 80's, after Madonna got worked out, all the standards changed. Because if you see 60's beach movies, those girls are pretty, but they have thighs, their stomachs aren't flat and you never see that anymore.</p>
        <p>BERNHARD: Or if you see any of Russ Meyer's films.</p>
        <p>PARKER: It's funny because I always think how beautiful Isabella Rossellini is, and another person I always think of who's that beautiful is her mother. And her mother was like, a Woman. It's like, Oh, maybe someday I'll be a woman. She's just like flesh, and sexy!</p>
        <p>BERNHARD: You better start eating, honey. You got a long way to go.</p>
        <p>UDOVITCH: Did anyone see Kate Winslet in ''Holy Smoke''? She has a normal body, and she's beautiful.</p>
        <p>PARKER: I love her.</p>
        <p>PEREZ: But talking about Madonna, the sculptured body, nudity and sexuality, I feel so much pressure to stay small. And as you get older, it gets a little bit harder, and I love to eat. And when you go to Los Angeles, when you go on interviews and auditions, the first thing they look at is your chest and your hips -- they want to see how good your body is.</p>
        <p>MAZAR: I got prosthetic breasts, I got three sets. I got the chicken cutlets for the normal size -- these are all for mastectomy patients -- and then I got the next size, and then I got the nursing size, and I use them to create different shapes of body depending on the character, because sometimes I'll just figure out a way to not take my top off if I get the movie. But to get it, sometimes I walk in with these huge prosthetic breasts and big sweaters, because you know, you get a whole other body language.</p>
        <p>CHOUDHURY: I liked Rosie's ice cube scene in ''Do the Right Thing.''</p>
        <p>BERNHARD: But she was saying just before you got here that it made her cry when she was doing it.</p>
        <p>CHOUDHURY: But I liked your body, because I have breasts, so I was like, Oh, yeah. I was just comforted because there weren't many girls with that build.</p>
        <p>PEREZ: No, there weren't. First of all, back then there weren't many Puerto Rican girls in a lead role.</p>
        <p>UDOVITCH: And now there are so many.</p>
        <p>PEREZ: Yeah, right, there's two more! Since 1989!</p>
        <p>choudhury: And the thing is, everybody says about Kate Winslet how they love her body, but the truth is, out in the world, no one really does. I mean, everyone does, but no one wants to hire that body. It's like everyone says they love my body, but then I'm supposed to lose weight.</p>
        <p>UDOVITCH: I'm curious -- does anyone disdain people who choose to augment their bodies?</p>
        <p>PARKER: It doesn't bother me. Also, you don't like to rule anything out. I mean, I'd like to think I wouldn't do that, but who's to say? It's different for women, we have this window, certainly more in the movie business than in the theater, and even in television it's probably a little better than in the movies. I feel like I have this window in the movie industry, and it closes a little bit every day, and I'm now one of these people who talk about all these young people -- Who are they? Where are they coming from? -- and they're all on the magazines. I have no illusions about what I look like or what I don't look like. Until 9 or 10 years ago, I didn't even have a role where men were interested, I was always like the cerebral best friend of the pretty girl. But that to me was all right, because I thought, Well, I'll work, because there will always be work for actors. But for women, there's this window. So when I think about plastic surgery, I think, Well . . . maybe it keeps the window open a little longer.</p>
