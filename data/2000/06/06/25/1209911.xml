        <p>We are asked now by two writers, one a philosopher, the other a psychologist, to consider the contemporary fate of America's boys -- how they have been faring in recent years. The philosopher, Christina Hoff Sommers, tells us right off, through the wording of her title, that we ought be concerned, even alarmed: there is a ''War Against Boys''; then in a subtitle we learn that ''Misguided Feminism Is Harming Our Young Men.'' The psychologist, William S. Pollack, offers, with Todd Shuster, ''Real Boys' Voices'' and immediately summons ''the Boy Code,'' defined as ''old rules that favor male stoicism and make boys feel ashamed about expressing weakness or vulnerability.'' Indeed, before any of the boys' voices are given ample presentation, the writing listener makes this insistent and conclusive summary: ''Although our boys urgently want to talk about who they really are, they fear that they will be teased, bullied, humiliated, beaten up and even murdered if they give voice to their truest feelings.'' This in a democracy -- but the author is not a sociologist or a political scientist, so he quietly calls upon his own profession: ''Thus, our nation is home to millions of boys who feel they are navigating life alone -- who on an emotional level are alone -- and who are cast out to sea in separate lifeboats, and feel they are drowning in isolation, depression, loneliness and despair.''</p>
        <p>What is one to make of such portentous propositions, if not outright prognostications? Sommers once taught at Clark University, but these days she is the W. H. Brady fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. She is no stranger to polemics, and is not reluctant to declare herself an adversary. Her previous book was titled ''Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women.'' Pollack works at McLean Hospital outside Boston and teaches at Harvard Medical School, and this new book of his is an obvious continuation of a longstanding interest and commitment, first declared two years ago with the publication of ''Real Boys.'' That book's subtitle also pointed to worrying news: ''Rescuing Our Sons From the Myths of Boyhood.''</p>
        <p>Pollack is still comfortable with the suggestion that there is enough trouble for American boys to justify such an attempt; he is quick in both books to spell out the social and emotional hazards our young men must endure. And in both books, he spots evidence of youthful trembling, of persistent worries that life will turn bad: ''Many boys are still telling us that when they walk the streets of their neighborhoods or the hallways of their schools, they have to watch everything they do to make sure they will not be taunted and attacked.'' But he can go further, refer to ''constant fear and anxiety,'' turn all too rhetorical, present himself to the reader as a psychiatric claimant for an entire nation's boys: ''They need to form meaningful friendships and relationships in which they can be openly caring, loving and affectionate without fear of being seen as 'weak' or 'feminine.' ''Some pages earlier, we are warned that ''a majority of America's boys experiment with drugs and alcohol, many slipping precipitously toward addiction,'' though nowhere is evidence offered for such a sweeping assertion. Then comes this psychological escalation -- again unsupported: ''Still others fill the social and emotional void with their fascination with television (more than 80 percent of boys tune in every day), the Internet, video games and the whole gamut of electronic media. There's a broad dilemma of disconnection that is infecting our culture.''</p>
        <p>The boys Pollack calls as personal witnesses can be persuasively introspective and socially discerning. They speak compellingly, sometimes with winning earnestness and candor. Antonio, 17 and from the Northeast, confides that ''my pen and paper are my shelter.'' Gordon, 18 and from the South, quotes pointedly from Sherwood Anderson's ''Winesburg, Ohio,'' and with a wry shrewdness from J. D. Salinger's ''Catcher in the Rye'' -- Holden Caulfield lives in this young man's mind, as he has for so many of us, still, long after we met him. ''God is the person who is there when nobody else is,'' Cedric, 14, a city boy from the Northeast, announces, and his religious musings are shared by many of the boys whose voices are put forth in this book. These self-portraits are conveyed with disarming innocence one moment, with knowing bluntness the next, and altogether, from boy after boy, with a great deal of savvy that in its sum might give pause to those who worry about this generation's capacity to take accurate measure of what is happening (socially, economically, culturally) and why.</p>
        <p>No question, such forthright testimonies are not to be met in Christina Sommers's pages. She speaks of our children, yet hasn't sought them out; instead she attends those who have, in fact, worked with boys and girls -- and in so doing is quick to look askance at Carol Gilligan's ideas about girls, Pollack's about boys. Much of ''The War Against Boys'' comes across as Sommers's strongly felt war against those two prominent psychologists, who have spent years trying to learn how young men and women grow to adulthood in the United States. Pollack, we are informed, ''is attributing pathology to normal boys, and his conclusions are expansive and alarming.'' The same charge is directed at Gilligan, at her well-known book ''In a Different Voice,'' and at her more recent effort to understand how boys as well as girls come to sometimes difficult terms with our country's social conventions and values. At moments, a lengthy, disapproving attention to Gilligan becomes argumentatively strained, raised to a high, hectoring pitch: ''I find Gilligan's sentimental, celebratory, valorizing description of adolescent girls implausible and inaccurate. Her study of 'unfairness and not listening' -- despite its charts, graphs and tables -- is a caricature of research. Most of the girls' comments are entirely ordinary. Gilligan inflates their significance by reading profound meanings into them.'' As for Gilligan's recent work, she ''appears to be making the same mistake with boys that she made with girls'' -- that is, ''she observes a few children and interprets their problems as indicative of a deep and general malaise caused by the way our society imposes sex-role stereotypes on them.''</p>
        <p>Sommers wants to examine Gilligan's working research files, makes bold to ask whether ''the data actually exist.'' She tells us, intending a put-down, that Gilligan's ''methods have remained anecdotal and impressionistic -- with increasingly heavy doses of psychoanalytical theorizing.'' Such a description, of course (if meant to be friendly and appreciative), might aptly be applied to the work of Freud himself, and to that of Erik H. Erikson, Gilligan's deservedly esteemed teacher -- whereas Sommers shows little interest in exploring with favor the manner in which an attentive psychologist or psychiatrist can learn from people, then describe them in a way (clinical storytelling) that brings to life their experiences and concerns, connects them to the imaginations of countless readers.</p>
        <p>As I read through this book's dense excursions into a ''war'' that seems directed at feminist writers, who have had their own (quite understandable) reasons to worry about the way girls, and boys too, have come to regard their future prospects (and contemporary situations), I kept thinking of others who have been ''anecdotal'' and ''impressionistic'' in their attempts to know boys and girls adequately and fully -- writers with no claim to science, only the novelist's intuitions and descriptive, evocative capabilities. I thought of Elizabeth Bowen's girl Portia, in ''The Death of the Heart,'' and Toni Morrison's girl Pecola, in ''The Bluest Eye''; Tobias Wolff's chronicle of boyhood in ''This Boy's Life''; Richard Ford's similar probing of a boy's fate under a particular set of American circumstances, in ''Independence Day,'' and yes, the sonorous, echoing prefiguration of that book's title (and story) in the song of that name offered by our troubadour, Bruce Springsteen -- all of them quite able to give us searching glimpses of our sons and daughters, who Sommers worries are being shortchanged by some of our social scientists, and by the journalists she seems to regard as gullible or irresponsible. (She refers to ''journalists who prefer disseminating sensational claims to looking for dissenting voices,'' and speaks of ''uncritical journalism.'') Let us hope and pray that more citizens of our country, and with them the author of ''The War Against Boys,'' will seek the truths about those boys (and girls) that our novelists and poets and singers render for our consideration.</p>
