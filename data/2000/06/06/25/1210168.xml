        <p>Maura Elizabeth Hester, a daughter of Harris Hester of Darien, Conn., was married yesterday to Ralph Robert Hersom, a son of Leoda Hersom of South Grafton, Mass., and the late Ralph Hersom. The Rev. William McIlmoyl performed the ceremony at Grace Episcopal Church in St. Helena, Calif.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Hersom, 31, graduated from Tulane University and received an M.B.A. from New York University. Next month, she will begin as an associate in the equity research department at Warburg Dillon Read, the investment bank in New York. She is a stepdaughter of Mary Elizabeth Hester.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hersom, 29, is the wine director of Le Cirque 2000 in New York, where he created the wine list. He is also the founder of winedirector.com, a New York-based Web site.</p>
        <p>Although the couple live in New York, they chose to marry in California, in the Napa Valley, for nostalgic reasons. Seven years ago, Mr. Hersom dropped out of Central New England College in Worcester, Mass., where he was studying electrical engineering, and made his way to San Francisco via airplane and Greyhound bus. He arrived with $725 and the dream, he said, of becoming a sommelier. He became a waiter within three days and a sommelier, at Moose's restaurant, within three years.</p>
        <p>In 1996, he was hired at Windows on the World in New York. He didn't know anyone in Manhattan, so a friend gave him the phone number of someone to call: Ms. Hester. They talked on the phone occasionally for three months until they finally met for a drink after work one night, which meant midnight for him. (She took a nap beforehand.)</p>
        <p>''On the phone, I just thought, 'Oh, he's a nice guy,' '' she remembered. ''I didn't think anything romantic at all. But the moment we met, I took one look at him and instantly, he was no longer a friend.''</p>
        <p>As it turned out, her father was a wine collector and she also loved wines. ''The joke in my family is you never let go of your wine glass because someone else would drink it,'' she said. Since the couple met, she has tried rare sherries and precious chardonnays and learned a lot about everything from grape-growing techniques to corkscrews.</p>
        <p>In August 1999, he proposed on a chartered wooden sailboat off Martha's Vineyard. He brought the diamond ring on board, tethered to a floatable key chain in case it fell in the water, as well as a bottle of 1989 Krug Clos du Mesnil Champagne and his favorite Champagne glasses.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hester remembers his proposal: ''He said, 'You're the most beautiful girl, you're the smartest girl in the world. I'm so proud of you.' It was like this five-minute list of compliments. I was like, 'Can I drink my Champagne now?' I had no idea he was going to propose. But when he did, I couldn't stop crying.''</p>
