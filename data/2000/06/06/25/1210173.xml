        <p>Arrow Marks the Spot</p>
        <p>Q.  In Battery Park I recently saw a cobblestone next to a walkway that had a small copper arrow set into the top. A child in the park suggested that it marked buried treasure. Could it?</p>
        <p>A.  Perhaps, after a fashion. The significance of that arrow has been a subject of debate among Parks Department staff. Some believe it to be a surveyor's marking. Others think it once pointed toward a path leading to Castle Clinton, a fort built in the early 1800's on a manmade stone island a hundred yards off the Battery, and later connected by landfill to the mainland.</p>
        <p>The most persuasive explanation, however, comes from Jonathan Kuhn, a Parks Department historian, who said such arrows exist in parks throughout the city and were placed by utility companies to pinpoint spots where junction boxes providing power to tall iron lamps are buried two to three feet below ground.</p>
        <p>''They didn't want to have the boxes above ground because that wouldn't look too great,'' Mr. Kuhn said. ''But they still needed a way to show workers where the boxes were in case they needed attention.''</p>
        <p>No Stopping Him Now</p>
        <p>Q.  Several times, late at night, I've ridden south on Second Avenue from 42nd Street to Houston Street without once having to stop for a red light. Is this common?</p>
        <p>A.  Given the proper circumstances, the experience you describe is not uncommon, said Rudy Popolizio, the director of systems and engineering management for the Transportation Department. Mr. Popolizio, who oversees the 2,700 traffic signals in Manhattan said traffic lights on one-way avenues operate most of the time on a progressive system.</p>
        <p>This means that for a driver who travels at a consistent rate of 30 to 33 miles an hour, the signals will turn green sequentially. Assuming drivers are not slowed down by such impediments as pedestrians, double-parked vehicles, construction sites or broken-down automobiles, they may be able to go long stretches without being forced to stop for a red light.</p>
        <p>Mr. Popolizio said signals on one-way avenues are set up to provide slightly more green light time to vehicles traveling north and south.  He added that signals at some intersections at certain times -- for instance, major cross streets like 42nd Street at midday -- are set up to provide a more equal portion of green light time to vehicles traveling east and west to avoid crosstown traffic jams. Those riding north and south on avenues away from the center of town during off hours have the best chance of enjoying an uninterrupted ride.</p>
        <p>''If you're riding on Second Avenue at night, you're in utopia,'' Mr. Popolizio said. There is no record for longest distance traveled without encountering a red light, but Mr. Popolizio said theoretically there is no limit to how far you might drive without pausing. ''If the signals are performing and you're able to keep a steady pace,'' he said. ''You could ride nonstop from one end of Fifth Avenue to the other.''</p>
        <p>Expatriate Dollars</p>
        <p>Q.  I've heard that a large proportion of United States currency circulates in foreign countries, and I'm guessing that much of it starts the trip overseas from New York City. True?</p>
        <p>A.  ''That's absolutely true,'' said Doug Tillett, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. There is $600 billion of United States currency in circulation, Mr. Tillett said, roughly two-thirds overseas.  Banks reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York sent $4 billion out of the country in May, and  $16 billion in the first five months of this year.</p>
