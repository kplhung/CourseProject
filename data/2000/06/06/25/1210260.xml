        <p>LAST week, the Supreme Court ruled that student-led prayers at high school football games are unconstitutional. Largely overshadowed by the decision was another important case concerning separation of church and state in an educational setting. By a 6-to-3 vote, the high court let stand a lower court ruling in Tangipahoa Parish Board of Education v. Freiler, which barred a Louisiana school board from requiring that the Darwinian theory of evolution only be taught with a disclaimer mentioning the biblical story of creation.</p>
        <p>The decision came just weeks before the 75th anniversary of the Tennessee ''Monkey Trial,'' in which John T. Scopes, a high school teacher, was charged with violating the state's anti-evolution law. That trial, which pitted the orator William Jennings Bryan against the celebrated lawyer Clarence Darrow, has been ingrained in the popular imagination as the archetypal clash of scientific enlightenment and old-time religion.</p>
        <p>Even if Tangipahoa v. Freiler hasn't captured the public's attention or inspired the high drama of ''Inherit the Wind,'' it offers a fresh look at the continuing struggle over the role of religion in the classroom. Excerpts from the case documents and reactions to the decision follow.</p>
        <p>THOMAS VINCIGUERRA</p>
        <p>The original disclaimer, adopted by the school board on April 19, 1994, read in part as follows and was meant to be quoted by the teacher before any classroom study of evolution:</p>
        <p>It is hereby recognized by the Tangipahoa Parish Board of Education, that the lesson to be presented, regarding the origin of life and matter, is known as the Scientific Theory of Evolution and should be presented to inform students of the scientific concept and not intended to influence or dissuade the biblical version of creation or any other concept.</p>
        <p>It is further recognized by the Board of Education that it is the basic right and privilege of each student to form his/her own opinion or maintain beliefs taught by parents on this very important matter of the origin of life and matter. Students are urged to exercise critical thinking and gather all information possible and closely examine each alternative toward forming an opinion.</p>
        <p>A transcript of the April 19 meeting reveals the major objections that Herb Freiler, the father of a student and a future plaintiff in the case, raised to the resolution:</p>
        <p>Gentlemen, we have, among other beliefs -- let's see, I've jotted down a few -- we have snake handling, we have speaking in tongues, faith healing, some people rolling in the aisles, we have the spectacle of Jimmy Swaggart, oh, Jim and Tammy, Oral Roberts, who speaks in -- in physical terms of what the Lord should give you.</p>
        <p>Other than the tremendous amusement value of these things . . . the point of all this is that America was made and founded basically on freedom and tolerance -- that is, to live and let live, respect for other people's opinions. What you are doing . .  is to just foist [your] own fundamentalist Christian viewpoint on the citizens of this parish at great embarrassment to many of us.</p>
        <p>The board member who originally proposed the disclaimer, E. F. Bailey, had this response:</p>
        <p>If it were a government class, a history class at school, and the teacher got up and was going to talk about various forms of government . . . and he or she talked about the dictatorial forms of government and didn't mention democracy, and then went on to another subject, wouldn't people stop and say, ''Hey, wait, didn't you forget democracy? Don't we live in a democracy? You forgot about that.'' . . . And isn't that -- is that what we're doing now? Isn't it so that a large percentage, something in the [neighborhood of] 90 percent of our youngsters, are taught, from infancy on up, that God created all life and matter? . . . Here comes their first science class, and . . . somebody comes and tells them that they are a mere accident, that they're a product . . . of the Big Bang theory and that that's why they are here, and the kid is thinking and saying: ''Wait a minute. This doesn't coincide with what my parents taught me. This is not what I learned in Sunday school.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Freiler and two other plaintiffs filed suit.  Among those who submitted friend-of-the-court briefs on behalf of the parish board were the Christian Legal Society and the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America. In a joint filing, they argued, among other things, that:</p>
        <p>Leading scientists have challenged on scientific grounds the conjunction of evolution and the general materialistic presuppositions of 19th-century philosophy . . . and the more specific view that there is no purposeful cause for the universe.  . . . Sir John Polkinghorne, a distinguished astrophysicist who served until recently as president of Queen's College of Cambridge University, notes that all serious physicists of this century agree that a satisfactory account of the universe must include two sets of seemingly contrary laws: chance and necessity, gravity and electromagnetism. But the profound question that no scientific account can satisfactorily answer is, ''Why is this so?'' For an answer to the question ''Why?,'' Polkinghorne insists, we are driven by physics beyond physics to metaphysics.</p>
        <p>In a countering brief, the National Center for Science Education offered this perspective:</p>
        <p>Evolution, like the theories of heliocentrism and gravitation, is considered ''factual'' even if specific details remain to be worked out. It is a core idea of science that underpins all present study of plant and animal biology, and there is no genuine dispute in the scientific community that it occurs. . . . The reason that the scientific literature does not define evolution as a theory of metaphysics is that science deals with questions of how things occur, not ''why'' they occur.</p>
        <p>In 1997, a district court in Louisiana found the disclaimer to be unconstitutional:</p>
        <p>While encouraging students to maintain their belief in the Bible, or in God, may be a noble aim, it cannot be one in which the public schools participate, no matter how important this goal may be to its supporters. . . .</p>
        <p>Last year, the decision was upheld on appeal. Earlier this year, in a petition to the Supreme Court, lawyers for the school board took issue with the lower courts' reasoning:</p>
        <p>In the parish schools, evolution is taught; the ''biblical version of creation'' is not! How can the effect of the disclaimer be to endorse or advance a concept that is merely mentioned, using only four words, when evolution is the only concept for the origin of life and matter that is included in the curriculum, the only one that will be explained and discussed in any lesson following the disclaimer's being read?</p>
        <p>Understood and considered in the context in which it is intended to be used, the disclaimer expresses tolerance for the views of all students.</p>
        <p>In his dissent to last week's Supreme Court decision to let the lower court rulings stand, Associate Justice Antonin Scalia wrote:</p>
        <p>In Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97 (1968), we invalidated a statute that forbade the teaching of evolution in public schools; in Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578 (1987), we invalidated a statute that required the teaching of creationism whenever evolution was also taught; today we permit a Court of Appeals to push the much beloved secular legend of the Monkey Trial one step further.  We stand by in silence while a deeply divided Fifth Circuit bars a school district from even suggesting to students that other theories besides evolution -- including, but not limited to, the biblical theory of creation -- are worthy of their consideration.</p>
        <p>The following day, an editorial in a local newspaper, The Hammond Daily Star, expressed relief that the matter had been resolved:</p>
        <p>God has not been forced out of the schools.  Neither the Supreme Court nor any other governmental entity is so powerful that it can keep God outside any walls or prevent people from praying.  Students, teachers and anyone else at school can and still do pray, read the Bible, and exercise their religious beliefs as long as they don't interfere or push their views on anyone else and as long as they are not disruptive to classes and school activities. . . .</p>
        <p>Let the teachers teach. Let the students learn.</p>
        <p>The School Board has more urgent issues to tackle -- do we have to name them? -- attracting and keeping qualified teachers, adequately providing and managing resources, hearing and addressing parents' concerns, leading and overseeing efforts to improve school facilities.</p>
        <p>Let's move on.</p>
        <p>But the matter is anything but settled. After the decision, Mr. Bailey of the school board vowed to press his cause. Although he announced no specific plan of attack, he said one option might be to eliminate the teaching of evolution altogether.</p>
