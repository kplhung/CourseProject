        <p>IT'S a puzzling sight -- and, frankly, a vaguely comic one. On a beautiful spring morning, a few minutes before 8, a parade of vehicles -- many the glossy, leather-appointed, cupholder-laden destroyers favored by today's suburbanites -- make their way slowly along a driveway to the front door of the Dobbs Ferry High School. There, after clawing through this jungle of a traffic jam, they drop off their charges -- healthy, fully ambulatory teenagers.</p>
        <p>The thing is, Those parents could have dropped their children just 50 yards away, on Broadway, and saved themselves a good chunk of gridlock time. (Or, heaven forbid, let them walk to school, which in many cases is all of half a mile.) But no, they must be deposited at the door.</p>

        <p>IT'S a puzzling sight -- and, frankly, a vaguely comic one. On a beautiful spring morning, a few minutes before 8, a parade of vehicles -- many the glossy, leather-appointed, cupholder-laden destroyers favored by today's suburbanites -- make their way slowly along a driveway to the front door of the Dobbs Ferry High School. There, after clawing through this jungle of a traffic jam, they drop off their charges -- healthy, fully ambulatory teenagers.</p>
        <p>The thing is, Those parents could have dropped their children just 50 yards away, on Broadway, and saved themselves a good chunk of gridlock time. (Or, heaven forbid, let them walk to school, which in many cases is all of half a mile.) But no, they must be deposited at the door.</p>
        <p>For a long time, this bizarre daily ritual mystified me. But then I read a book called ''Luxury Fever'' by Robert H. Frank, and suddenly it all became clear.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frank argues, basically, that we are surrounded by so much luxury that we feel enormous pressure to keep up -- that, in awe of the luxurious life, we do some very odd things indeed.</p>
        <p>For parents, clearly, the deluxe life means door-to-door service for their little darlings.</p>
        <p>But that's only the tip of it. Westchester, to my mind, has an acute case of luxury fever everywhere you look. It is one of the nation's richest counties, so you would think that all that money could buy an awfully good way of life. But we repeatedly make choices that, taken together, make life considerably less pleasant.</p>
        <p>We are brainwashed into thinking we need bigger and bigger houses, so we build monstrosities that are too big for comfort -- simply because we can afford them and want to show the world we can afford them. If the Joneses have 10,000 square feet, we must have 11,000 -- with columns. These McMansions crowd the precious land, hulking monuments to luxury madness.</p>
        <p>From our modest house, we have a pleasant view of woods on the neighbor's property in the back. We knew all along that the neighbor's house could be expanded, but figured that any addition would not affect us. But sure enough, a huge house is about to rise there, obliterating our view.</p>
        <p>We could rake our lawns and mow them with hand mowers, or hire teenagers to do it for us, but what message would that send? No, the luxurious thing is to hire a landscaping company, whose workers will swoop in with deafening leaf blowers and other power tools to make our grand estates almost comically immaculate.</p>
        <p>Does the noise (by one estimate, a leaf blower can cause permanent hearing damage in a minute and a half) drive our neighbors crazy? Does the pollution foul the air? Do the chemicals we use on our lawns foul the water? We don't care. The luxury life demands it.</p>
        <p>I've mentioned my disgust with leaf blowers to people in less affluent locales, and they say people generally don't use them. They're not, apparently, keeping up with anyone.</p>
        <p>And look at what we drive. Unless we plan to tow battleships or scale rock faces before cocktails, sedans or station wagons would serve our needs just fine. But no -- we must shout to the world that we are larger than life, so we buy brawny sport utility vehicles, willingly paying exorbitant prices for what are essentially trucks with ribbons. And when our neighbors buy bigger sport utilities and we lose our bragging rights, we buy bigger ones still.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frank says the luxury landscape is littered with choices that are ''smart for one, dumb for all,'' and sport utilities are a perfect example. They might make one family safer -- though even that is open to question, because these things tend to tip over. But they create hazards and increased traffic (studies show that drivers give sport utilities more space, thus extending any line of traffic) for the rest of us.</p>
        <p>Compounding the traffic woes in a luxury town like Dobbs Ferry is the fact that most people have forgotten that it's possible to propel yourself with your own two feet. To walk is to admit failure in a car-crazy world. We drive to the gym and use a luxury treadmill instead.</p>
        <p>What this all adds up to is that with our excess wealth we methodically do all we can to make our lives less pleasant. Yes, the rich are different. They have more traffic, more dangerous roads, listen to more noise and have more closets to keep organized. And their children will never, ever walk a block if they don't have to.</p>
        <p>And thus it will remain until a cure is found for luxury fever.</p>
