        <p>I remembered seeing French Indo-China on old maps. But I knew nothing about that region's history, and very little about European colonialism, for that matter, apart from its role in my country's formation. Not until much later could I connect the dots between a war against the Commies in a faraway jungle and Club Med's delightful fantasy of primitive life on a South Pacific island. Now, after reading Patricia A. Morton's new book, ''Hybrid Modernities'' (M.I.T. Press), I can see that Club Med's fake grass huts were part of the greater global village, not an escape from it.</p>
        <p>Ms. Morton, an architecture historian at the University of California, Riverside, takes as her subject the International Colonial Exposition held in Paris in 1931. The event was sponsored by the French government and staged in the capital's poor, eastern quarter. It was conceived as a celebration of the colonial system and therefore a justification for it. Though primarily devoted to French colonies, the exposition also included sections on territories ruled by the Netherlands, Belgium, the United States, Portugal, Germany, Denmark and Italy. Pavilions for individual colonies were executed in indigenous architectural styles. Native colonials were imported to perform music and dance, to demonstrate craft techniques and to provide living simulations of local color. These displays were juxtaposed with official French pavilions designed in the classically derived Art Deco style.</p>
        <p>The fair's organizers touted the authenticity of the reconstructed native architecture. A previous expo, held in 1890 at the foot of the new Eiffel Tower, had also included pavilions on the French colonies, but these had been designed as imaginary pastiches of exotic styles. In 1931, the organizers invoked the authority of accuracy -- of science, that is to say, thus intimating that what visitors saw was objectively true. Extending this hint to the expo's overall design, a visitor might conclude that the cultural superiority of France to its colonies was self-evident. The layout conveyed in spatial terms that European civilization occupied an advanced position to which other peoples could, as yet, only aspire.</p>
        <p>Ms. Morton defies the caricature of the post-modern cultural critic. At no point does she deny the objectivity of science or the positive uses to which it has been put. Her target is the transformation of science into unscientific myth. Like ''Orientalism,'' Edward Said's blast against Western ways of looking at Eastern ways of life, Ms. Morton's book unmasks the attitudes behind common Occidental rituals. Reversing the anthropological lens, she scrutinizes the Western habit of scrutinizing others. At the Colonial Exposition, this habit was given a habitat.</p>
        <p>Ms. Morton studies in detail how the fair's ostensibly authentic pavilions actually deformed the originals on which they were based. The Cambodian pavilion, for example, was a Westernized version of the Angkor Wat, reconfigured in an axial Beaux-Arts composition. Inside, there were galleries arranged in the traditional enfillade of the classical Western museum. These were filled with display cabinets for ethnological artifacts. (The actual Angkor Wat has no inside.) Outside, instead of indigenous jungle foliage, the temple sat in a terrace paved with modern glass blocks: a skylight for the galleries underneath.</p>
        <p>Thus, despite the accuracy of its reproduced sculptures, the temple was a deformed membrane separating the inner and outer halves of a thoroughly Parisian space. An Enlightenment virtue (exactitude) was used to lend credibility to a shameful cause (colonial exploitation). This is what Ms. Morton means by hybrid modernities. The intention of the expo was to emphasize the separation -- the difference -- between France and its colonies. The result was the reverse: a display of 30's decorative motifs. It placed three-dimensional panels of exotic styles in an art moderne frame. The claims of accuracy, authenticity and objectivity diverted attention from the warped perspective of the whole.</p>
        <p>Hindsight is 20/20. But the 1931 Expo was criticized in its own time for the same reasons Ms. Morton identifies. French Communists thought it glorified the exploitation of workers overseas. The Surrealists saw it as a perfect example of the way modern civilization flattens the sacred dimension of everyday life. Ms. Morton devotes nearly a chapter to a counterexposition organized by the Surrealists to coincide with the state event.</p>
        <p>This production was staged in the empty Constructivist building designed by Melnikov for the Soviet Union for the 1925 Paris Exposition des Arts Decoratifs (the fair from which the term Art Deco was derived). To contradict the idea that the West represents rationality, the Surrealists drew on the twin poles of their thought: the Freudian subconscious and the Marxian belief in social emancipation. The cultural exhibitions were directed by Louis Aragon. They included African, Oceanic and American tribal artifacts that had been collected by Tristan Tzara, Andre Breton and Aragon himself. Wall placards bore inscriptions from Karl Marx. Roman Catholic figurines and ladies' hats from Parisian designers were displayed as symbolic equivalents to tribal fetishes.</p>
        <p>THIS chapter raises Ms. Morton's book above the level of a diatribe against colonial abominations. Instead, it becomes a tribute to Surrealist tradition. As is more widely understood today than at any time since the 1940's, the Surrealists regarded their paintings and writings not as aesthetic objects but as catalysts for cultural change. Thus the ''counter-expo,'' while containing no Surrealist paintings, was an ideal Surrealist work: temporary, collective, dialectical, fusing political and psychological realms.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Morton points out, the organizers of the official expo might have included European work that was influenced by exposure to tribal artifacts. After all, it was in 1907 that Picasso first depicted African masks in his work. By 1931, Josephine Baker had been the toast of Paris for six years, fashion and interior design depicted primitivist themes and a romantic mythology of colonial life was already well established. Dashing aviators, the French Foreign Legion, Jean Gabin, travel posters, slippers in the sand: these images were already integral to the French imagination.</p>
        <p>They were not, however, to be seen at the Colonial Exposition, because the purpose of the event was to affirm the segregation of France from its colonies, not to reveal that the two had already begun to interbreed. Despite the intention, the expo produced the opposite effect. From an anthropological and even an aesthetic point of view, the expo demonstrated cross-fertilization. Behold the Angkor Wat with glass block tiles. Thirty-five years later, in postcolonial times, the expo has morphed into Club Med, with sarong-draped youths, drinking Cokes purchased with plastic beads, railing against American imperialism on a North African beach.</p>
        <p>Ms. Morton sees the expo as a microcosm of Greater France. She writes, ''The Exposition occupied a 'middle region' of experience where the norms, rules and systems of French colonialism both emerged and broke down, unsustainable because of their internal contradictions.'' In other words, the expo could be faulted not simply because colonialism was immoral, but because it was absurd. This was the lesson of the Surrealist show as well. If it was absurd to exhibit Paris fashions in an anthropological setting, it was no less ridiculous to promenade religious artifacts in an ethnographic setting. The Surrealist objective was to show that the official expo was itself Surrealistic. Their outlook, a natural response to the internal contradictions of modernity, remains a useful approach for exposing the inner conflicts of our day.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK, 2000. Low crime, high times. Last March, police officers issued 220 summonses to owners of small shops in lower Manhattan. The Chinese merchants were charged, among other things, with violating a set of design restrictions issued in 1975 by the New York City Department of City Planning. This program, called Little Italy Risorgimento, focused on the design of storefronts along Mulberry and other streets in Little Italy. It was a precursor of what would later be called contextual zoning, legislation intended to preserve the existing character of New York neighborhoods. ''The delights of the San Gennaro Festival should be the rule,'' stated a document outlining the design regulations for the new Little Italy special district.</p>
        <p>I shuddered when I read that sentence 25 years ago. At the time, New York was just awakening to the full horror of the festival marketplace going up at South Street Seaport. But at least that maritime theme park was quarantined. Now the pestilence had broken out on a real city street. Since then, there has arisen an entire industry for branding streets with mix-and-match colors, lighting, signage, street furniture and other techniques adapted from suburban malls.</p>
        <p>The problem with Little Italy was not just a matter of taste. As in Paris, it was a question of internal contradiction. Though the new zoning was promoted in the name of diversity, it actually reflected a desire for sameness. A seasonal festival should become The Rule. Only approved colors could stand for The Character of Little Italy. Illuminated arches overhead should unify the street. The contradiction became more evident with the police crackdown on the Chinese merchants. Not only had they failed to represent the approved ethnicity. They also dared to show that diversity exists even among themselves. Since context is a matter of time as well as place, the police were destroying the very tissue the design guidelines were supposed to protect.</p>
        <p>We could see this as Italo Calvino might: Marco Polo imagining the legendary cities of Cathay while remaining behind in Venice. After all, it's not very useful to appraise contextual zoning on purely aesthetic grounds. Once you accept that city streets should be branded, it doesn't make much difference which colors are chosen. Blue, green or orange, the twinkling lights, storefronts or banners will look the same. But the Surrealist critique remains as available as the formalist one. It is perhaps the most useful method we have for revealing the values at work in environments constructed in the name of civilization: a Tahitian village in Tunisia, a Cambodian temple in Paris, or a freeze-dried street festival at our feet.</p>
