        <p>The Senate passed a milestone -- though not necessarily a law -- when it adopted a hate crimes bill that listed sexual orientation, along with race, religion, national origin and handicapped status, as a protected category.</p>
        <p>The bipartisan vote, 57 to 42, was the first time either house of Congress had moved to protect gay people on a roll call that could have political consequences. The measure was strongly supported by President Clinton, and its fate may depend on his willingness to insist that House Republican leaders accept it before signing spending bills that will let Congress go home.</p>
