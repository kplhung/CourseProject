        <p>IN the expensive and historic village of Stonington Borough in southeastern Connecticut, a long-closed five-acre industrial site on Stonington Harbor represents a plum for developers, and for most of a decade there has been public debate about what should go there. But Clearview Investment Management's proposal for a $30 million commercial and residential project, which would rehabilitate buildings where rifles were made during the Civil War and would open the waterfront to the public,  seems to have satisfied most demands.</p>
        <p>In fact, when the plans were unveiled at a  public meeting in March, residents actually broke into applause. The next steps in the approval process for the project will be a site plan review by the borough's Planning and Zoning Commission and a coastal area management permit from the state's Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
        <p>Andrew W. Maynard, the borough warden, or chief elected official, said of Clearview's project: ''The great thing about it, and what made it such an acceptable proposal, was the adaptive reuse of the historic structures. That's what gained the support of the community.''</p>
        <p>Michael H. Davis, the president of the Stonington Historical Society, agreed.  ''They have been very sensitive to the historic elements of the site, preserving everything that we feel should be preserved,'' he said. ''This is obviously a project with a great deal of risk involved, in terms of the cleanup of an industrial site and the renovation costs. Their willingness to take this on, and do it in a sensitive fashion, has really impressed me. Frankly, I didn't think it could happen.''</p>
        <p>Seth G. Weinstein, Clearview's chairman, said: ''The buildings that are coming down are the post-World War II structures along the water. They're in pretty bad shape and really don't have any historic value.''</p>
        <p>Clearview's proposal includes five waterfront homes of 2,000 to 3,000 square feet, 40 condominiums, offices, a 38-room inn, a restaurant, several thousand square feet of retail space, a community meeting room, a waterfront park, a fitness center, a pier for pleasure boats and boat slips.</p>
        <p>Robert A. Brown, the president of the Stonington Borough Development Corporation, a nonprofit group formed to try to find a developer for the site, said the wrong use of it could have ruined the entire village. The entire borough of 170 acres is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the five-acre Clearview site includes two buildings that date from about 1850.</p>
        <p>''We got involved because nothing was happening with the mill, and it was falling to pieces, and we were just worried it was going to be lost,'' Mr. Brown said. ''Five acres doesn't sound like much, but to the borough, that's a lot of land, and if those mill buildings were ever taken down, it's hard to conceive of anything new fitting in with the rest of the borough. What it really is, is a 19th-century urban area, with a wonderful sense of community, where you can walk to all the shops and restaurants. This project will help preserve that community.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Maynard said concern about the  project's impact in terms of increased traffic, noise and activity in the area should be put in perspective. ''Clearly, it's going to be more intensely traveled than it has been for the last few years,'' Mr. Maynard said. ''But most people who've been here a while remember when there were three shifts of workers at the plastic plant there. At one point, they employed 700 people, so I don't think it's going to be a huge concern, what they're proposing.''</p>
        <p>The borough is part of the Town of Stonington, the most southeasterly town in Connecticut, but because all of the borough's 170 acres are on a point of land, it seems almost separate from the rest of the town, particularly since railroad lines and Route 1 provide a sort of boundary to the north.</p>
        <p>The property has seen industrial uses since at least 1849, when a foundry opened there. In 1851, Jonathan F. Trumbull, whose family produced many of the state's early political leaders, started a horseshoe nail factory, which was converted to make rifles during the Civil War.</p>
        <p>The plant later turned out textile machines, and the name Atwood Machine Company is still visible on one building. During World War II, gun turrets and submarine parts were made there, and since the war, a series of machine shops had made molds for plastic bottle manufacturers. In fact, many people still refer to it as the Monsanto property, because the company made forms for plastic bottles there for years, beginning in 1957. The last company to occupy the site was the InnoPak Corporation,  which bought it from Monsanto in 1987 and shut down its operations three years later.</p>
        <p>It was then bought by United Progress Inc., a Japanese company that proposed tearing down the buildings and putting up a big hotel. But that plan met with widespread opposition and never went further.</p>
        <p>CLEARVIEW is a joint venture Mr. Weinstein formed in 1996 with Charles Mallory, whose family is in the shipping business and has been associated with Stonington and nearby Mystic for about 300 years.</p>
        <p>''We've had our eye on this property for several years, and it finally became available at a price that we thought was reasonable,'' Mr. Weinstein said. Clearview bought  the property for $5 million earlier this month and plans a $1.5 million environmental cleanup there.</p>
        <p>Frederick Bland of Beyer Blinder Belle, the Manhattan architectural firm that is designing the project for Clearview, said: ''For the past 150 years the borough has been increasingly cut off from its waterfront as the Atwood plant grew. That will now change as we knit the most historic elements of this plant back into the fabric of this remarkable waterfront village.''</p>
        <p>Clearview has shown that it is sensitive to public concerns. In Stamford, where Clearview just completed Southfield Harbor, a 15-acre waterfront development, that project was originally s supposed to have three nine-story buildings with residential, commercial and office space. But Clearview changed the project to 323 apartments in two four-story buildings after Stamford residents complained that the original proposal would block views of the water and would generate too much traffic. ''We took the same approach in the borough,'' Mr. Weinstein said. ''To go in and try to fight a community to develop a project makes no sense to me. We don't want to ram anything down their throats if they don't want us to be there.''</p>
        <p>The approach also seems to work with regulators. Charles H. Evans, the director of Long Island Sound programs for the state's  Department of Environmental Protection, took note of Clearview's public park and  boating proposals. ''The state's Coastal Management Act puts a strong emphasis on uses that are water-dependent and improve public access,'' Mr. Evans said. ''And if they are willing to address the pollution problems on the site, that would certainly be a positive thing.''</p>
        <p>Betty Richards, the chairwoman of the borough's Planning and Zoning Commission, said public opinion about the potential reuse of the site had been mixed, which  poses a challenge from a planning perspective. ''A lot of people have cared deeply about keeping it industrial, because they don't want the borough to become just another resort community,'' she said. ''On the other hand, you could find people who think those buildings are ugly, and the factory should be torn down.''</p>
        <p>While she said she could not prejudge Clearview's application, the commission has already amended the zoning regulations to allow the sort of mixed uses and increased height that Clearview is proposing.  Before the commission took action last month, only industrial uses would have been allowed on the site.</p>
        <p>Richard A. Bardwell, the dockmaster for the commercial fishing fleet, the last one in the state, which operates from a pier north of the Clearview site, said the local boat captains don't believe the development will have any impact on their use of the waterfront, and many, like him, support it.</p>
        <p>''People come here because of the fishing fleet,'' he said. ''There's the Mystic Seaport right nearby, but that's dead, that's history, and this is live. But to say that we should keep the Monsanto property an industrial use is ridiculous. Nobody wants something like that down the street.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Maynard, the borough warden, agreed, but said it was also important to keep the mill building in some way. ''That whole neighborhood, Trumbull and School and Diving Streets, was originally factory housing,'' he said. ''So if you remove the factory, you remove the historic context. And with new construction, unless it's done very carefully, to my eye it always falls a little short of authentic. So it was important that those historic elements remain.''</p>
