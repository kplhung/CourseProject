        <p>THIS place got its name in 1893, when it became a Long Island Rail Road terminal. But some residents of West Hempstead are in favor of upsetting 107 years of tradition and changing their hamlet's name. Something soft and fuzzy like Mayfair Park, Mayfair Gardens or Echo Park. Maybe Lakeview, in a gesture of solidarity with another unincorporated neighborhood to the south.</p>
        <p>Seth Bykofsky, president of the West Hempstead Civic Association and a leader of the name-change campaign, said that for any person or community to thrive, a distinct identity is needed. Being a directional modifier for Hempstead, he said, doesn't quite make it.</p>
        <p>''It's quite simple,'' Mr. Bykofsky said. ''It's an opportunity for us to have an identity of our own.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bykofsky reported that in a recent West Hempstead Civic Association poll, 2,386 residents voted in favor of a name change and 1,025 voted against. Most of the votes were cast online, he said, but others were sent through the mail or by telephone. Mr. Bykofsky said that respondents were checked against email and telephone lists to guard against repeat voting or votes by outsiders.</p>
        <p>''You don't get near this many people voting for a school budget or fire commissioner,'' Mr. Bykofsky said, estimating that 40 percent, or 2,600, of the 6,500 West Hempstead households voted. ''This vote is extraordinary.''</p>
        <p>Mike Capaldo, president of the West Hempstead Chamber of Commerce, sounds convinced that a change is needed. ''There would be enormous benefits to the community from a business standpoint,'' he said. ''The trend for all businesses is to look toward brand equity and identity, and we would achieve that by choosing a name that would represent the community.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps. But Nassau County is full of North Bellmores and Baldwin Harbors and Williston Parks. Great Neck, Garden City, Roslyn and Hewlett each have four communities using some variation of the name. Only West Hempstead is campaigning for a name change.</p>
        <p>Other, uglier motives are being advanced. One is that West Hempstead residents don't want to be identified with Hempstead because Hempstead is 59 percent black. According to the same Census Bureau listing, West Hempstead is 95 percent white.</p>
        <p>''That is absolutely untrue,'' Mr. Bykofsky said of the accusations. ''Our community is racially and ethnically diverse. It has absolutely nothing to do with that. What it has everything to do with is gaining an independent identity.''</p>
        <p>But he acknowledged that he was trying to distance his community, where 1.8 percent live below the poverty line, from negative perceptions of Hempstead, where 12.4 percent are officially listed as poor.</p>
        <p>''Hempstead has an aggressive, effective mayor and it is building itself up,'' Mr. Bykofsky said. ''But for so long, the image evoked when you hear the name Hempstead, you think failure -- failed schools, high crime rate, very little positive news. I'm not saying that's true, I'm saying that's the image perceived.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Capaldo agreed, saying that the image hurts West Hempstead in attracting new businesses.</p>
        <p>''It goes beyond Hempstead,'' Mr. Bykofsky said. ''I wouldn't want to be East Franklin Square or South Garden City. If Hempstead wants to be East Mayfair Park, that's fine with me.'' He cited a recent Newsday article that featured a West Hempstead high school student, referring to her as a Hempstead High School student. ''See what the omission of four keystrokes can do?'' he said.</p>
        <p>Jack Prophet, chief administrator for the African-American Media Network in Hempstead, believes the name change is somewhat racially motivated. ''There's nothing wrong with people who want to distinguish themselves,'' he said, ''but to do it because someone else is the lesser is wrong.'' He did acknowledge that adding Lakeview to the list of proposed names weakened the argument, since the existing Lakeview is predominantly black.</p>
        <p>Anne Marie Koelbel, a member of the Lakeview Civic Council, lives in the part of Lakeview that shares West Hempstead's school district and post office. She has her own theory about what is behind the name change.</p>
        <p>''There's a group of people in the community,'' she said, ''that have ulterior motives for the name change. The people who control the civic association are predominantly Jewish and are in real estate. The place is totally controlled by the Jews. They have a lot of kids, and I know this is going to sound anti-Semitic, but the Jews want the best for their kids and they don't worry about whose pockets they are emptying.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Koelbel said that the motive behind the name change is to make the community more appealing for Jews to ''buy up all the property'' and ''control the area,'' citing last year's dispute when Orthodox Jews requested same-sex swimming hours at the pool at Echo Park, a Town of Hempstead facility.</p>
        <p>She also said that the name change will end up costing money to alter legal documents, stationery, advertisements and the like.</p>
        <p>Mr. Capaldo would not respond to what he referred to as Ms. Koelbel's ''specious remarks.'' Mr. Bykofsky, who is Jewish, said, ''I will not give credence to her,'' adding that out of 13 board members of the West Hempstead Civic Association, only two are Jewish, and neither is affiliated with any real estate company.</p>
        <p>The next step is to agree on a new name. A second round of polling has begun, and Mr. Capaldo said the early front-runner is Mayfair Park, the area's original name. Mr. Capaldo's preference is Lakeview, for the community's proximity to Hempstead Lake. ''It's the most historically legitimate and it's the prettiest,'' he said. ''They're all positive names and that's what counts.''</p>
        <p>The winner of the new-name survey is to be submitted to a more formal mail referendum. If the community votes in favor of the name change, the United States Postal Service, which has jurisdiction over the formal renaming of unincorporated areas within the Town of Hempstead, will be petitioned to make the change. Tom Gaynor, a postal service spokesman, said it must evaluate the information and make sure the name isn't a duplicate.</p>
        <p>''The fact is that the people who already live in West Hempstead have a positive feeling about their town,'' Mr. Capaldo said. ''But what we need to do is to attract business from the outside, from people who might not feel the same way as our residents.''</p>
        <p>Whether West Hempstead becomes Echo Park, Mayfair Gardens, Not West Hempstead, or even retains its name, Mr. Bykofsky said he is confident that ''our community will continue to live as a diverse one, living in harmony, where everyone wants the best for their kids. Basically, it's just a name. But to many of us, it's investing in the future.''</p>
