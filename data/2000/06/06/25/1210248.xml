      <block class="full_text">
        <p>WE are on the brink of a new computing revolution.''</p>
        <p>''As big a transition as from DOS to Windows.''</p>
        <p>''Microsoft's Net bet is boldest yet.''</p>
        <p>Lest anyone possibly miss the point at the Microsoft Corporation's big media event last week, the captions in the slide show and demonstrations were all intended to convey the notion that the company's strategy for the future would be, in the words of another Internet company's ubiquitous ads, ''big -- really big.''</p>
        <p>And, just to add a little more emphasis, William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, told the assembled analysts and reporters from around the globe, ''You could say it's a bet-the-company thing.''</p>
        <p>Under continuing assault in its antitrust battle with the government, Microsoft held the event not only to offer a glimpse of some new products -- including software for talking computers and ''interactive paper'' tablets -- but also to suggest that it had a much broader vision of the future.</p>
        <p>And the company, judged a predatory monopolist in federal court, took pains to paint it as a friendly future in which it would work with competitors and partners alike to make the Internet as easy to use as a television or a telephone.</p>
        <p>In time, Microsoft said, it would essentially transform the heart of its revenue base from packaged software to subscriber-paid ''interactive services.''</p>
        <p>Whether consumers, analysts and investors will wind up going where the company wants them to go remains to be seen. And there's still the antitrust case, which the company's top officials tried to acknowledge with a bit of roundabout humor.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, noted that the event itself was delayed three weeks to avoid coinciding with Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's ruling that he wanted to split the company in two.  ''For me, the last three weeks made me feel almost like a caged animal,'' he told the crowd. ''I wanted to come out of the closet and tell everyone what we've been up to! But, 'back in the closet,' the P.R. people said. You really don't want to do this on that day.' ''</p>
        <p>So, now that the day for ''this'' has arrived, what is Microsoft's vision for its next generation of services, which the company calls ''.NET'' (pronounced dot-net)?</p>
        <p>In essence, according to the demonstrations at the company's conference center here on Thursday, Microsoft.NET is about offering what is often called a ''cloud'' of services on the Internet, to be accessed by a range of personal devices, including hand-held ''tablets'' and organizers, cell phones, cameras and whatever else inventors dream up.</p>
        <p>It promises a world of incredibly instant gratification. In one video, called ''Family Vacation,'' the Microsoft presentation depicted an entire trip being arranged in moments. Dinner reservations at a fancy restaurant are made instantly via a two-way camera link to the maitre d'. He greets the caller on screen and beckons to the table where Mom and Dad might be seated with Mom's parents, who are then messaged to make sure that the restaurant is suitable. Of course, the smiling grandparents instantly message back.</p>
        <p>During the vacation, the family goes on an outing to the zoo. For some reason, the grandparents don't go, but they can share in the pleasure in real time: when the family comes up with an especially nice picture on their digital camera, they send it, wirelessly, to the grandparents, who are watching television at home.</p>
        <p>''Oh, look at that!'' Grandmother beams, so taken with it that she pushes a button and zaps it into a frame that sits on a table by the sofa.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's world would also let people talk to their computers, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>''What do you want to do now?'' the female-voiced computer asks a sales manager in another demonstration. He asks, ''How's the market doing today?'' and after verifying if he wants to know about the Dow or Nasdaq or both, she -- or it? -- returns in seconds with the latest report. Then he asks to schedule a meeting with a colleague later in the week. ''Let me see if you are both available at that time,'' his computer tells him, then schedules the meeting into their calendars.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ballmer said the company had dedicated more than half of its roughly $4 billion budget for research and development to the new strategy and would keep spending huge sums on it.</p>
        <p>For the strategy to really succeed, of course, hardware vendors and software developers will have to follow Microsoft's lead. But given the languid response to the company's push into consumer electronics, such an entourage is by no means guaranteed. And many other companies, from America Online to cellular providers, hope to provide a ubiquitous Internet connection.</p>
        <p>While some of the products Microsoft talked about this week will be rolled out within months, others probably will not show up for years or a decade, if ever. Still, many analysts credited the company with laying out a strong vision.</p>
        <p>And the strategy has already created some interesting strange-bedfellow alliances.</p>
        <p>Loudcloud, described by its founder as a ''software power grid in the sky'' that can help businesses in all sorts of ways, said last week that it would be Microsoft's software development partner for a number of Internet services. The founder in question? Marc Andreeson, whose Netscape famously did battle with Microsoft in the ''browser war'' that is at the heart of the antitrust case.</p>
        <p>''If you asked me six months ago whether I'd be partnering with Marc Andreeson,'' Mr. Ballmer allowed, ''I would have thought that was pretty strange.''</p>
