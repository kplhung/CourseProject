        <p>PROSPECTIVE home buyers surveying the mortgage market have  seen mortgage rates rise steadily if undramatically since last June, prodded by Federal Reserve interest-rate increases. But in recent weeks rates on the benchmark 30-year fixed-rate mortgage have been easing somewhat. Adjustable-rate mortgages, meanwhile, have been steadier in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>Largely because of the narrowness of the spread between rates for fixed and adjustable mortgages, lending specialists say, fixed-rate loans, which cannot change over the term of the mortgage, have been gaining popularity in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>If much of what has been happening to mortgages seems like deja vu all over again, home buyers returning to the market after an absence of a few years might be struck by some changes. The most striking perhaps is the availability of loans through scores of sites on the Internet, sites that, like many others on the Web, offer interactive tools that allow prospective borrowers to play out an infinite number of ''what if's'' involving a wide variety of mortgage rates, down payments and types and terms of loans.</p>
        <p>Other changes involve personal mortgage insurance, or P.M.I., designed for low-down-payment loans, and changes in the mechanisms for deciding who will get loans and what rates they will qualify for. A key part of the loan-approval process, called credit scoring, has become increasingly controversial even as more is being disclosed about the methods used in computerized credit evaluation.</p>
        <p>Weekly average rates for 30-year mortgages dropped from a high for the year of 8.82 percent for the week ending May 19 to 8.37 percent for the week ending June 16. Last Wednesday, the rate was 8.33 percent. One-year adjustable-rate mortgages stood at 7.37 percent for the week ending May 19 and 7.38 percent the week ending June 16, but rose to 7.55 percent on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>A major factor in the increases in the last year has been the actions of the Federal Reserve, which has raised interest rates 1.75 percentage points since last June, hiking the rate a quarter point five times and a half point last month.</p>
        <p>In the first quarter of this year, adjustable-rate mortgages (known as ARM's) accounted for 31 percent of all mortgages nationwide, compared with 12 percent in the same quarter in 1999. But midway through the second quarter, the last period for which statistics are available, they dropped back to 29 percent, compared with 17 percent for the second quarter of last year, and lenders say their percentage of the mortgage market is continuing to fall.</p>
        <p>''Our experience is that current applications for ARM's is down from 32 percent to about 15 to 20 percent,'' said Luke Hayden, a vice president of the Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation.</p>
        <p>Stephanie Cullum, an associate broker at Hubbell &amp; Klapper, a real estate concern in Garden City, N.Y., said she had seen a similar pullback.</p>
        <p>The main reason, real estate specialists say, is that the difference between the interest rate for adjustable-rate mortgages and that for fixed-rate mortgages has been too small to make the variable-rate loans appealing to borrowers. Keith Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH Associates in Butler, N.J., which publishes information on the mortgage market, said that ''the average spread needs to be upwards of 2 percent,'' for adjustable-rate mortgages to be a clear choice, ''but of late they've been considerably narrower.'' The spread was as much as 3.25 percentage points in 1994, but by 1998, the spread had dropped to as little as 1.23.</p>
        <p>While fixed-rate mortgages remain constant throughout the length of the loan, adjustable-rate mortgages (including so-called hybrid adjustables, which combine features of both fixed-rate and adjustable loans) carry a lower interest rate initially and offer a wider array of choices. But after a set period of time -- one year, three years, five years and even seven years are typical -- the interest rate on adjustable-rate mortgages can rise, pegged to a benchmark like the Federal Reserve rate, and can typically increase by as much as 6 percentage points over the life of the loan.</p>
        <p>A hybrid ARM, in which the initial rate is set below the rates for fixed-rate mortgages, can make financial sense if the homeowner intends to sell the property before the loan is adjusted, or if interest rates decline during the time covered by the initial rate, making it worthwhile to refinance.</p>
        <p>These days, the refinancing market is moribund. ''Since the Fed started raising rates a year ago, refinancing virtually disappeared since it's driven almost entirely by interest rates,'' said Doug Duncan, the chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. ''At this moment, the share of applications for refinancing is down to 12.45 percent, the lowest in four or five years.''</p>
        <p>One of the most significant changes in the mortgage market in recent years is that people wanting to know about mortgages are flocking to the Internet for information and to compare loans. But contrary to some expectations, few borrowers are actually applying for loans over the Internet.</p>
        <p>Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., predicted last year that online mortgage lending would soar more than five-fold from 1999 to 2003, to about $91 billion, or 10 percent of the total mortgage market. But its most recent analysis, published this March, reported that mortgage lenders ''worry about the lack of consumer acceptance and the low close rates on applications to date.''</p>
        <p>A recent analysis of Internet mortgages by Kenneth A. Posner and Michael D. Courtian of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter noted that while recent surveys have found that more than 50 percent of people who take out mortgages use the Web to research prices and terms, only 1 percent apply online.</p>
        <p>Prospective borrowers gather a lot of information on the Web, said Mr. Duncan of the mortgage bankers group, ''but when it comes to actually filling out and signing the documents, they realize it isn't a simple transaction so they back away.''</p>
        <p>The main reason people looking for mortgages avoid online brokers, the Morgan Stanley study said, is that they are especially wary of putting their Social Security numbers, employment information, income and assets online.</p>
        <p>A NOTHER stumbling block had been the refusal of some states to accept electronic signatures as binding in online transactions, including mortgages.  But that obstacle was overcome when a bill making e-signatures binding passed both houses of Congress by lopsided margins less than two weeks ago. The measure is scheduled to take effect Oct. 1 after it is signed by President Clinton.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Web sites for homes and mortgages are proliferating, and many contain information useful to previous home buyers and to neophytes.</p>
        <p>These include house listings by price, neighborhood, street address and ZIP code. Lists of mortgage lenders and comparative rankings of their loans are available. So are calculators to help consumers determine whether to refinance and to estimate monthly payments, loan amortization and cost savings from paying off mortgages early. Some Web sites can help borrowers choose between fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans. Others explain what documentation lenders will need to close the loan.</p>
        <p>Some online companies alert customers by e-mail when new listings become available, while others provide automated updates on the status of their loans. In addition, Microsoft's recently revamped Home Advisor.com helps homeowners diagnose maintenance problems and provides instruction in making minor home repairs.</p>
        <p>The Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest buyer of mortgages from banks and other lenders, revamped its Web site last month to enable consumers to compare all the costs of getting a mortgage, including interest rates and points, mortgage costs, appraisal fees and title insurance fees. Customers can also find lenders or credit counselors in their areas, along with a comprehensive glossary of mortgage terms.</p>
        <p>People who have taken out mortgages before won't be surprised to learn that if their down payment is less than 20 percent, they will be required to have private mortgage insurance. But they may be surprised to learn that when their equity in the property reaches 20 percent -- a percentage that the mortgage industry considers likely to forestall default -- they can request cancellation of the insurance, which typically costs $30 to $100 a month.</p>
        <p>Lenders are not required to cancel the insurance for loans approved before July 29, 1999, when the Homeowners Protection Act took effect, but most do, if only to remain in the good graces of Fannie Mae and the similar federal agency, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or Freddie Mac. Because these two agencies set the standards for the mortgages they will buy, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have enormous influence over the mortgage market.</p>
        <p>Meantime, while some Americans continue to buy homes with relatively little money down, many home buyers are paying cash for half or more of their purchases. While few borrowers today are required to pay points, the add-on fees that were common in the 1970's and 1980's, about half of them do so, in order to lower the interest on their loans. Each point represents 1 percent of the mortgage and therefore reduces the amount of money being borrowed.</p>
        <p>Neil Bader, the chief executive of IPI Skyscraper Mortgage, said that in recent months he has often seen down payments of 50 percent or more. So has Ms. Cullum of Hubbell &amp; Klapper in Garden City. What's happening, she said, is that as homeowners  trade up, selling their houses for top dollar, they put the money toward a more expensive home. ''People here don't want a big mortgage,'' she said. ''They want a mortgage that's controllable, and they want to diversify their portfolios.''</p>
        <p>The vast array of mortgages available to home buyers is attributed in large part to the introduction of automated underwriting systems, which quickly and accurately collect, collate and electronically process information and evaluate loan applications.  These evaluations also determine how big a mortgage an applicant is likely to be able to repay.</p>
        <p>''Our system looks at every single applicant the same way every time,'' said Pam Johnson, the vice president in charge of the single-family mortgage business at Fannie Mae. She added that the agency's proprietary automated underwriting system, Desktop Underwriter, eliminates subjectivity in measuring borrowers' ability to make their mortgage payments. Freddie Mac has a similar system, Loan Prospector, that collects and processes credit information about applicants.</p>
        <p>Another virtue of automated underwriting systems is their flexibility. Mr. Bader of IPI Skyscraper said: ''They enable more people to qualify for mortgages. People with small down payments can not only qualify for mortgages but for mortgages with reasonable interest rates.''</p>
        <p>''Slicing and dicing'' credit information has helped scuttle some long-held certitudes about mortgages -- especially the belief that a borrower's total monthly payments, including mortgage, taxes, home insurance, auto loans and credit cards, should not exceed 36 percent of gross family income.</p>
        <p>Now, because of automated underwriting systems, there is no ''one size fits all'' formula for mortgages. The systems have helped create niche markets for lenders, including what is known as the subprime market, the market for borrowers with less-than-sterling credit. Mr. Gumbinger of HSH Associates said this niche had ''expanded massively'' in recent years.</p>
        <p>''Ten to 15 years ago you'd put 20 percent down,'' he said. ''Then in the last 10 years it went down to 10 percent, then 5 percent. Three years ago Fannie Mae came out with 3 percent down. Now there are even loans with nothing down, plus 3 percent for closing costs.''</p>
        <p>THE Morgan Stanley Dean Witter study cited a number of examples in which automated systems have helped make niche markets not only possible but potentially profitable. Before automated underwriting technology, the authors said, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac rejected many niche loans -- among them, the subprime sector and what's called the alternate-A sector, whose borrowers are unwilling or unable to document their income. Now, lenders are underwriting those loans, often at higher interest rates.</p>
        <p>This year, the authors of the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter study said, Fannie Mae niche products will account for 10 to 15 percent of its total portfolio growth, while Freddie Mac's niche products will make up at least 5 percent of its portfolio.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the authors say, when faced with a loan application that does not measure up, Fannie Mae's underwriting system now comes back with a counteroffer suggesting that higher down payments, supplemental mortgage insurance or the payment of points could result in approval.</p>
        <p>While prospective home buyers are understandably preoccupied by interest rates -- the purchase of a house is typically anyone's single biggest expenditure -- many people shopping for a mortgage in the next few months will also have something else to talk about: credit scores.</p>
        <p>The exact ways that these numerical scores are derived has been almost as closely guarded a trade secret as the formula for Coca-Cola, even as the use of credit scoring has become widespread in the last decade. Political pressures have recently forced the scorekeepers to promise to open the arcane credit scoring process to public scrutiny. If they do -- and not everyone is convinced they will, at least not wide open -- prospective home buyers will finally be able to learn their scores and what they can do to improve them.</p>
        <p>So far, only mortgage lenders and people whose loan applications were turned down are entitled to learn their scores and how they were arrived at. By contrast, qualified applicants are denied access to their scores and the factors that went into them, thus preventing them from discovering how to push their scores higher to qualify for a bigger mortgage or for a more favorable interest rate.</p>
        <p>Fair, Isaac &amp; Company, a privately held financial services concern in San Rafael, Calif., developed the mathematical model for determining credit scores and its scores are used in more than 75 percent of all new mortgage decisions. It says the reason it withholds credit scores is to avoid ''possible consumer confusion and misunderstanding.''</p>
        <p>''We're concerned that consumers could misinterpret their scores and then take action to improve them that could actually wind up damaging their scores,'' said Craig Watts, a spokesman.</p>
        <p>The credit scores -- known by the acronym FICO, derived from the company's name -- range from the 300's to the 900's, but more than two-thirds of consumers score in the 600's and 700's, Mr. Watts said.  Scores of 640 and higher will usually be sufficient to qualify the prospective borrower for a mortgage. ''Scores in the 300's are just as rare as scores in the 900's, but both of them exist,'' Mr. Watts said.</p>
        <p>''FICO scores are powerful tools and very predictive in capturing a borrower's credit history and rolling it up into a number, but they are only one of 14 factors we look at,'' said Ms. Johnson of Fannie Mae.</p>
        <p>But Fannie Mae will soon drop FICO scores altogether from the 14 factors it uses in its Desktop Underwriter system, which evaluates about half the loans it buys. ''We made a commitment early this year to take the lead in providing a bill of rights for consumers,'' Ms. Johnson said, ''and that includes making the reports available to people.''</p>
        <p>On June 7, Freddie Mac, which competes with Fannie Mae for mortgages and has said that it will continue to use FICO scores, turned up the heat on Fair, Isaac when it released the list of factors used in its automated underwriting service to analyze mortgages. At the same time it called on Fair, Isaac and the broader credit-reporting industry to make the scores available to all applicants.</p>
        <p>While Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the 800-pound gorillas in the mortgage jungle, what really tipped the balance in favor of credit-score disclosure was the decision last February by E-Loan, an Internet mortgage provider, to post FICO scores on its Web site.</p>
        <p>''We had more than 25,000 consumers check their score in less than a month,'' said Tiffany Kelley, an E-Loan spokeswoman. The scores would have remained available  longer, she said, but Equifax -- one of three national credit-reporting agencies licensed to run individuals' credit information through Fair, Isaac's proprietary system -- stopped supplying the credit scores to E-Loan.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a bill pending in the California Legislature would require lenders to provide all mortgage applicants with their credit scores, as would a bill (H. R. 2856) introduced in Congress by Representative Chris Cannon, Republican of Utah.</p>
        <p>A S pressure for disclosure mounted, early this month Fair, Isaac posted on its Web site a list of what it said were ''the five things that count most'' in its scores. At the same time it announced it was developing a Web service that would ''explain individual FICO scores, further 'demystifying' this vital link in the credit process.'' It also said it was in discussions with the national credit reporting agencies --  Experian and Trans Union, along with Equifax -- about changing contract agreements that prevent lenders from disclosing scores directly to borrowers.</p>
        <p>The five most important categories listed on Fair, Isaac's Web site, together with the overall percentage assigned to each category, are:</p>
        <p>*Payment history, including whether the applicant has paid past credit accounts on time (35 percent).</p>
        <p>*Amounts owed on all accounts, and on different types of accounts (30 percent).</p>
        <p>*Length of credit history (15 percent).</p>
        <p>*New credit, including the number of new accounts (10 percent),</p>
        <p>*Types of credit in use, including what kinds of credit accounts and how many of each (10 percent).</p>
        <p>Although critics say that Fair, Isaac's disclosure of these percentages is an improvement over being left in the dark, they fault the company for not being specific -- for example, not explaining whether it is better to have many or fewer credit accounts, or whether it makes no difference so long as all accounts are paid when due.</p>
        <p>While the intricacies of the mortgage market can be confusing, the overall effect of the array of loan products has been helpful, a study to be released on Tuesday by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University concludes. ''The strong economy, together with innovative mortgage products and expanded outreach,'' the study says, ''has created unusually favorable conditions for home buyers.''</p>
        <p>Graphs: ''The Rate Roller Coaster. . . ''</p>
        <p>Interest rates on both fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages have risen in the last year, as the Federal Reserve increased rates six times since last June. In recent weeks, rates on fixed interest loans have eased somewhat, while those for adjustable rate mortgages have remained stable.</p>
