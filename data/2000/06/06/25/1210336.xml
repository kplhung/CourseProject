        <p>This article was reported by David Barstow, C. J. Chivers, Juan Forero, Sarah Kershaw and Nina Siegal and written by Mr. Barstow.</p>
        <p>Each time a police cruiser passed, someone in the game room screamed a curse. Mother this, mother that, on and on. They cranked the rap music to seismic levels, as if the lyrics -- something about ''cracker cops'' -- might make the police leave them alone. But still, the cruisers came. And then an unmarked Taurus went by. And then a police van with four officers passed.</p>
        <p>It was driving the teenagers nuts. They said they felt like ghetto lab rats. The night before, officers had raided the game room, a dim, grungy hole of a place on the edge of the Van Dyke projects in Brownsville, Brooklyn. Hunting for drugs, the officers had smashed open the pool table, and Qyntel Smith, 19, said she had been hit by pepper spray.</p>
        <p>Now, with the sun setting, Ms. Smith and her friends stood at the game room entrance making highly impolite gestures at passing police cars. A few officers scowled and responded in kind, making clear their professional assessments of the game room's young patrons. But Ms. Smith had an assessment, too.</p>
        <p>''The cops,'' she said, ''are not backing off. Not one bit. Never will. It's still Giuliani time.''</p>
        <p>Across New York City, in the drug holes and seedy side streets and shadowy hot spots where crime incubates, the Police Department continues to be seen as an aggressive force that has not retreated -- not one small inch -- from its kitchen-sink strategy of attacking crime. In short, most of those who have substantial contact with police officers do not share the suddenly popular perception that the Police Department has relaxed its enforcement tactics in the face of severe criticism.</p>
        <p>In interviews last week with about  200 people in all five boroughs, this view was repeated again and again -- by young gang members and tired ex-cons, by prostitutes and bodega owners, by scrawny heroin addicts and by public housing tenants.</p>
        <p>That perception gained force with the puzzling rise in murders, including the Wendy's massacre and the slayings of livery drivers. It gathered more force last week with the fallout from the frenzied Central Park sexual assaults after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade. Though hundreds of citations were written for public drinking, there were reports of officers ignoring rampant drug and alcohol abuse, and some officers have asserted that the behavior was tolerated to avoid provoking Hispanics.</p>
        <p>True or not -- and police officials say it is not -- people who live and work in New York City's roughest neighborhoods seem largely in agreement that they do not see any newfound tolerance of crime. With remarkable consistency, these residents told similar stories of facing intense scrutiny from undercover officers, of continuing to be ticketed and arrested for minor offenses, of officers sweeping through housing projects and parks, asking for identification and patting down pockets.</p>
        <p>Mixed Views on Enforcement</p>
        <p>For some, especially young black and Hispanic men, these stories were told with a sense of persecution. But for others, particularly homeowners and the elderly, the stories were told with relief -- so great was their concern that the police might be allowing complacency or criticism to dampen vigor.</p>
        <p>Dozens of these residents cited firsthand experience. Cheryl, a prostitute working the other night on Nevins Avenue in South Brooklyn, said she was arrested just the week before. ''And they'll be back,'' she said. On Hillside Avenue in Jamaica, Queens, a homeless alcoholic said he was ticketed two weeks ago for public drinking. Hector Rodriguez, 24, a security guard at a housing project in East Harlem, said he had recently been given a summons for loitering. On some blocks, just about everyone seems to have a story of a recent brush with the police.</p>
        <p>Taken together, their observations offer an imperfect street-level snapshot of the department's recent performance. Yet in precinct after precinct, these individual accounts are supported by the most recent arrest statistics.</p>
        <p>A good example is the 75th Precinct, by far the most violent precinct in Brooklyn. In the 75th, which covers East New York, arrests are up 27.7 percent, from 5,652 at this time last year to 7,220 this year. Major crimes are down 11.3 percent. The same pattern -- more arrests, more summonses, fewer crimes -- can be found throughout the city.</p>
        <p>As police officials are quick to note, none of this is new. For years, they have been pursuing the same strategy: using computer analysis of crime reports to identify trouble spots; sending in special teams of undercover officers to attack crime in those areas; relentlessly punishing minor offenses to set a tone of orderliness in the neighborhood. For all the criticism, for all the concerns raised about racial profiling, for all the protests over Louima and Diallo and Dorismond, this basic strategy thus far remains unchanged -- a fact reflected by arrest statistics and, now, by the experiences of some 200 residents living in neighborhoods struggling with poverty and crime.</p>
        <p>To back off now, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said in an interview, would be to repudiate the central tenets of the city's policing strategy, a strategy that has coincided with steep declines in all measures of crime.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't stay here if we were backing off,'' Mr. Safir said. But he also disputed that there had been any unspoken retreat by the rank and file, noting that his department had made 21,000 more arrests this year than it had last year at this time. ''That's not indicative of a police force that is falling asleep or backing off,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the neighborhoods that suffer the most from drugs and violence, there is a familiar cycle to crime and policing and public perception. It begins with a clear recognition of how far the neighborhoods have come from the bad old days of mayhem, and close behind is a deep fear of sliding back to that time. The result is a sort of heightened communal vigilance for the latest flare spots, and a general impatience for the police to get things under control.</p>
        <p>Such was the case last week in Mount Hope, a tiny neighborhood just north of the Cross Bronx Expressway in the South Bronx, where crack gangs once ruled. For some time now, retirees there have complained to the 46th Precinct police about drug dealing in front of a row house at Topping Avenue and East 175th Street. Their complaints were part of a broader restlessness, a sense that the police were not doing enough to preserve the gains of the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>''They used to pass by and they'd see a group of people loitering and they'd tell them, 'Stop,' '' said Edwin L. Santana, 45, a truck driver who has lived in the neighborhood for 20 years. ''They would check and say, 'What are you guys doing here?' ''</p>
        <p>And this is how Jay Nunez, 17, and his buddies came to have such a rough time of it on Thursday night.</p>
        <p>The first time the police came around, officers jumped from their patrol car, forced Mr. Nunez and his friends against a fence and patted them down for drugs. The officers left empty-handed, the young men said. But the next time the officers swooped down, they ticketed Randy Figueroa, one of Mr. Nunez's companions, for drinking a beer on the street. At other times, the police in marked or unmarked cars and vans simply rolled by.</p>
        <p>The men denied they were selling drugs, though John Ramirez, 21, said he was on parole for heroin dealing, and Mr. Nunez said he had been arrested for possession of marijuana. ''It's nothing,'' Mr. Nunez said. ''You spend the night in jail.''</p>
        <p>At 10 p.m., the police were back yet again, this time in an unmarked white van. Four burly officers peered out at the young men. ''Yo! Yo! What'chu looking at?'' one young man yelled. The others jeered, slapping each other and laughing. Mr. Nunez chimed in: ''Yeah, that's right, we're talking about you, pigs.''</p>
        <p>But the bravado did not mask their agitation. The corner may have its rewards, but now, because of the police, it carried a price, too. Getting searched for drugs is a nightly occurrence. Mr. Figueroa, 22, complained that he was ticketed on this night for parking his red sports car too close to the corner.  Suddenly, another unmarked police car, a black sedan, drove past. ''Here they go again,'' Mr. Nunez said.</p>
        <p>Amid Crackdown, Resentment</p>
        <p>Since the start of the year, officers in the 46th Precinct have handed out twice as many criminal summonses as they did by this time last year. Arrests for drugs and other crimes are also way up. But all this extra effort leads to another part of the familiar cycle -- simmering resentment from young people who have no criminal record but feel like targets nonetheless. ''They see you with chains, they think you're selling drugs,'' said Jose Alvarez, 19, as he fiddled with the speakers and amplifiers in his Acura. ''They don't know young people get up in the morning just like they do and go to work.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Alvarez, who said he worked at Toys ''R'' Us in Mount Olive, N.J., complained about being stopped again and again by the police in Mount Hope and asked about drugs. He complained about being ticketed for playing his music too loud, about being harassed for simply hanging out with friends. ''They bother you for everything,'' he said. ''If I stand in front of that building, they come and tell you to move. If you don't move, they arrest you.''</p>
        <p>Across the city, just north of Kennedy Airport, the same pattern has played out on Guy R. Brewer Boulevard, a street that cuts through the 113th Precinct in Queens.</p>
        <p>This year, though, serious crimes are up about 6 percent, evoking bad memories. The precinct has responded with a 21 percent increase in arrests, and a 51 percent increase in criminal summonses.</p>
        <p>Frank Moore, a barber on Guy R. Brewer Boulevard, does not know the numbers, but he has been around long enough, 10 years, to have a sixth sense for his neighborhood's rhythms. He senses that crime has been creeping back. He also senses that the precinct has responded forcefully.</p>
        <p>In recent months, he complained, officers have kept pulling him over, asking for his identification and registration. Certainly, he said, he does not want the neighborhood to slip back into the old mess, but neither does he want ham-fisted policing. And so, he said, he feels stuck between two unpleasant alternatives: wanting police protection yet resenting its consequences.</p>
        <p>''I'm not upset by just seeing the police,'' he said, ''but it's the nitpicking.''</p>
        <p>When Hot Spots Change</p>
        <p>Not far away, in Jamaica, perceptions about the Police Department are being subtly shaped by local tactical decisions that have nothing to do with City Hall politics, or with protests by the Rev. Al Sharpton, or with the latest police shooting.</p>
        <p>In Jamaica, the department's practice of concentrating officers on hot spots has created a remarkable situation in which two neighborhoods barely two miles apart have entirely different notions about the department's level of aggressiveness. In one neighborhood, a short strip off Hillside Avenue, some residents and merchants feel all but abandoned. In the other neighborhood, near Jamaica Avenue, some residents feel an overwhelming police presence.</p>
        <p>To understand why, a little history: Several years back, gangs and drug dealers swarmed along Hillside. The police responded in force, harassing and arresting the dealers and gang members until the corner was clear. Residents were overjoyed; shopkeepers could not believe their good fortune. With a job well done, police commanders pulled officers out and sent them to the next hot spot.</p>
        <p>For a time all was well. Then Luis Cruz, the owner of One Touch Transmission, found his shop burglarized. Then it happened again, and again after that. Nurul M. Islam, owner of a small grocery store, began to see more thieves in his store. Only a few months ago, he said, a drunken man stumbled in and began smashing bottles. And then Lori Vargas, a resident, realized that she no longer felt safe walking outside at night. ''There's no one out there,'' she said.</p>
        <p>To their eyes, the department had backed off. In fact, the police have been preoccupied with a new hot spot off Jamaica Avenue. Residents there had been complaining about drug dealers operating out of the Crystal Houses, a run-down housing project on 191st Street.</p>
        <p>For residents in that area, this has brought a heavy police presence. Officers have set up motorist checkpoints to inspect licenses and registrations. They often park a patrol car near the Crystal Houses. ''The place is crawling with cops,'' said Paul Chester, who lives not far away. ''They stop you for anything now. They are all over the place. You can see them lurking around, slowing down and checking this out.''</p>
        <p>Late Thursday night, a dozen or so young men were gathered in front of the Crystal Houses. Smoking marijuana and drinking beer out of brown paper bags, they complained of the constant police presence on their ''front lawn.'' Most of them said they had been arrested at least once, for minor drug offenses or disorderly conduct. Several said they had been in court in just the last week. ''If they could arrest you for spitting in the street, they would arrest you every time you spat in the street,'' said Derramius Edwards, 22, who described himself as a music major at Queensborough Community College.</p>
        <p>As midnight approached, two detectives approached in an unmarked car. They stopped when they got to Mr. Edwards and his friends. The detective on the passenger side stared at Mr. Edwards but said nothing. The car moved on. Twenty minutes later, another unmarked car crept down the street, this one carrying five detectives. It, too, paused by Mr. Edwards and then kept going. Just before midnight, the first car returned, stopping in the same place. The detective in the passenger seat slowly shined a flashlight across their faces. Nobody said a word. The car drove on. Mr. Edwards and company stayed put.</p>
        <p>Where Pressure Is Most Intense</p>
        <p>There are forsaken places in the city where the pressure from the police has been so relentless and longstanding that logic itself has been inverted by the criminals. These are the places where the police are seen as the cause of criminal activity, so smothering and inflexible that they make it impossible for a man to go straight. They are neighborhoods where the hostility is so seeped in that it is difficult for ordinary residents to express even mild support for the department's aggressive strategy.</p>
        <p>And so an elderly Hispanic woman who lives on a drug-ravaged street in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, whispered from her living room window Wednesday night that it was no good to say anything about the police. And in the Manhattanville housing project in Harlem, a 21-year-old man named Cgod Godallah, better known by his nickname, Can't Get Right, somehow finds fault with the police for arresting him yet again. ''We were hanging out, just chilling, smoking some weed,'' he said, as if all he were doing were drinking a glass of milk. And in Washington Square Park, a stoned 21-year-old drug dealer who called himself Smoke ran about raging against the police, shouting, ''Before I die I'm going to blow up a precinct!''</p>
        <p>A day later, in the shade of a housing project in the Clifton section of Staten Island, a 38-year-old ex-convict named Eric quietly raged, too, blaming the police scrutiny for driving him back to crime. ''They come out and ask for your identification and find out who's on parole, and then they target you,'' he said. ''They bring you in saying, you did this before and you must be doing it again. Well, 9 out of 10 of us have a record. So it's easy for them. They're just pushing you and pushing you until you do end up breaking the law. They're jumping down on us, and it makes you want to throw a brick.''</p>
