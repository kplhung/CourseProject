        <p>CONVENTIONAL wisdom says the music industry is under siege, threatened by Napster and MP3 and digital piracy.</p>
        <p>In the none-too-distant future, techno-visionaries declare, musicians will not need record labels. Instead, they will market and sell recordings directly to fans over the Internet. Even the labels that manage to hang on to their artists will find their sales eviscerated by piracy. With free music available on the Web via Napster and other song-trading services, only fools will pay for songs.</p>
        <p>That's the conventional wisdom. Why, then, did the French conglomerate Vivendi agree last week to pay $34 billion in stock for Seagram, whose Universal Music division is the world leader? And why did Jean-Marie Messier, Vivendi's chairman, describe music as the most important element of the deal? Or, as one music industry executive put it in language too colorful to quote directly: If things are so bad, how come we're selling so many records?</p>
        <p>Good questions all. In their rush to mock the Vivendi-Universal deal -- and to write off Bertelsmann, Sony, Time Warner and EMI, which with Universal dominate the $40 billion music industry worldwide -- fans of Napster, MP3 and other upstart technologies are ignoring the fact that the music industry is booming, perhaps a more powerful force in pop culture than ever before.</p>
        <p>In the United States, sales of albums, as the industry anachronistically calls full-length CD's and cassettes, are up about 8 percent, to 312 million through mid-June, according to Soundscan, which tracks such things. Albums released this year by Eminem, Britney Spears and 'N Sync had the three fastest-selling debuts in the history of the music industry. Eminem records for Interscope, which is owned by Universal, while Britney Spears and 'N Sync are on Jive Records, which is partially owned and distributed by BMG.</p>
        <p>Shipments of CD's are almost certain to top one billion this year for the first time, up from 940 million last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group. Over all, the industry is on track to ship more than $15 billion in CD's, DVD's, and even vinyl albums this year -- double the level of a decade ago.</p>
        <p>That strength comes in the face of the explosive growth of Napster, a free service that allows anyone connected to the Internet to trade songs with anyone else registered with the service. In the 18 months since it was created by Shawn Fanning, then 19 and a Northeastern University student looking for a way to share music files, Napster has registered more than 13 million users -- without any paid advertising.</p>
        <p>Along the way, it has become a cultural phenomenon, the subject of magazine cover articles and ominous news reports. ''Like techno-termites, computer users who swap free recordings are gnawing at the foundations of the music industry,'' The Wall Street Journal intoned on Tuesday, laying the blame for ''a piracy plague'' squarely on Napster.</p>
        <p>The recording industry is indeed concerned about Napster. Its new mechanism for distributing songs -- both convenient and free -- has proved its attractiveness, especially for the young people who are the most avid music consumers.</p>
        <p>In a lawsuit scheduled to be heard next month, the industry contends that the service contributes to copyright infringement. Napster disputes the accusation that its technology hurts record companies, arguing that it gives consumers a way to sample songs before buying albums.</p>
        <p>Recent rulings in other cases have gone the industry's way, and the music companies say they can create an equally convenient digital system that protects their property rights, though so far they have not.</p>
        <p>''Napster's growth indicates demand for music digitally, not demand for Napster,'' said Dave Goldberg, chairman of Launch Media, a company that has partnered with traditional labels to offer songs and music videos over the Internet.</p>
        <p>The focus on Napster and its Internet ilk ignores the established music industry's real strengths -- and the reasons that companies like Vivendi and America Online are buying into the business, Mr. Goldberg and others say.</p>
        <p>The companies are not paying billions for the opportunity to truck CD's to retailers. Rather, like movie studios -- to which most of the big record companies are attached -- they are first and foremost in the promotion and marketing business.</p>
        <p>In the United States alone, there are hundreds of thousands of bands with enough original material for full-length CD's. MP3.com, which operates an Internet site where bands can post music free, had 74,000 artists and 469,000 songs available for download at the end of May.</p>
        <p>Yet at any given moment, only a few dozen musicians occupy the public's attention, generating the kind of radio play, record sales and adulation that generations of garage bands have dreamed about. The others are just background noise.</p>
        <p>And it is the background noise -- or at least the kind of music little heard outside college quads -- in which the upstarts specialize. From December to March, the number of bands on the MP3.com site rose to 63,000 from 45,000. But the number of CD's sold on the site during that time  was stuck, at about 26,000 a month. (MP3.com stopped reporting its CD sales after March.) Put another way, consumers bought more copies of the new Britney Spears album on the day it was released than they have ever bought at MP3.com.</p>
        <p>''The record industry so far has a lock on almost all the marketable talent out there,'' said Ron Rodrigues, editor in chief of Radio &amp; Records, a Los Angeles newspaper that covers the music industry. ''There hasn't been an entrepreneur as of yet who's been able to skirt the recording industry as we know it and make money outside the system. The whole front end of the process by which the record gets marketed and played hasn't changed yet.''</p>
        <p>NOR is it likely to anytime soon. The keys, now more than ever, are money and size.</p>
        <p>After a decade of consolidation, the radio industry has two giant gatekeepers, Clear Channel Communications and Viacom's Infinity Broadcasting, which each control hundreds of stations across the country. Viacom also owns MTV -- if anything even more important than radio to the success of a new album. Both companies carefully build their stations' playlists -- making it difficult for an unknown band or song to become a hit in one market and spread to others.</p>
        <p>Hence the heightened power of the record labels, which themselves have consolidated into a few giant corporate hydras. The labels' clout is crucial to getting new bands broadcast exposure, the fuel that drives sales. Labels trade promotional appearances by successful, established bands for air time for new bands. They pay to sponsor concerts with local radio stations, a practice that some critics say skirts close to payola, the illegal act of paying to have a song played. They advertise everywhere from Rolling Stone magazine to posters on construction sites.</p>
        <p>Without all that, it is nearly impossible for a band to break through the clutter, said Michael Nathanson, who follows the music industry for Sanford C. Bernstein, the securities firm. Mr. Nathanson said that even Warner Music and EMI had struggled recently to get some new artists' songs on the air because BMG and Universal have been so dominant for the last year -- though he does not expect that situation to last.</p>
        <p>In addition to promotion and marketing, labels put up the cash advances that artists use to record their albums, and they offer creative advice, for better or worse. Sometimes the labels go a step further, actually creating bands with a sound and look they think will resonate.</p>
        <p>Critics who say Napster and MP3.com will destroy the labels ''have misunderstood the business of music,'' said Paul Vidich, executive vice president of Warner Music.</p>
        <p>A handful of performers, like Courtney Love, have protested the labels' dominance, but record executives say the current system works for most musicians, who lack the time or money to promote and market an album.</p>
        <p>''I don't think artists are in the position of being risk-takers like that,'' Mr. Vidich said. ''They would rather get a big advance.''</p>
        <p>Already, upstarts like MP3.com, which boldly declared last year that it would take power from established labels by offering bands higher royalty payments and direct access to consumers, seem to be recognizing that their role may simply be to push the industry to embrace new means of distribution and promotion.</p>
        <p>''We have no desire to put the labels out of business,'' said Hank Barry, Napster chief executive. ''We believe that this advance in technology will increase interest in music.''</p>
        <p>THE labels, after years of dragging their heels on digital distribution, seem finally to agree. Before the year is out, Universal plans to sell digital music over the Internet; eventually, Mr. Messier hopes to link the service to his budding cell-phone empire. Similarly, AOL is likely to explore way to electronically distribute music -- including Warner's -- to its customers.</p>
        <p>''Somewhere along the line, we thought the album was created by God and forgot it is not the only way that music is packaged and sold,'' said Jay A. Samit, EMI Music's senior vice president.</p>
        <p>Still, exactly how music will be sold in the future remains an open question. Mr. Goldberg favors subscription services that will allow users to hear as much music as they want, commercial free, for a fee of $15 or so a month. If the record industry could convince the 100 million Americans considered to be active music consumers to sign up for a subscription service, it would have annual revenue of $18 billion, slightly more than current annual record sales, he said. He also expects advertising-supported Internet radio services to become more popular.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Vidich said he thinks subscription services are unlikely to catch on as long as free, ad-supported radio is available. He says digital downloads of individual albums will more likely be popular -- as will traditional CD's.</p>
        <p>''People do like CD's'' he said. ''They continue to buy about 900 million CD's every year in this country. I don't think people are going to change their behavior dramatically. They're going to continue to do what they've done, and they're going to do new things.''</p>
