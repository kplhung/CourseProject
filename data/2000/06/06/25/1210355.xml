        <p>Roxanna Hutchinson has lived in the same building for 40 years, and even if she could move, she would not. This, she says, is her home.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people say they don't like it, but I love it,'' Ms. Hutchinson said. ''If you pay your rent, you know you've got a home over your head.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hutchinson lives in a building in what is known to many as ''the projects,'' a complex that is often thought of as a place to fear and to avoid, because of drug sales and gang activity.</p>
        <p>She remembers a time as recently as three years ago when drug addicts and dealers forced her to stay inside her home. But today, Ms. Hutchinson says, there is reason to celebrate.</p>
        <p>''They're cleaning up this place,'' said the 78-year-old retired domestic worker. ''It's much better than what it was.''</p>
        <p>Still, some residents say the problem of drug dealers has not been eradicated, and the lack of businesses within the area that are willing to reinvest in the community is a concern.</p>
        <p>Yesterday Ms. Hutchinson joined her neighbors and community leaders to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Queensbridge Houses, in Long Island City, which was the largest public housing complex in the nation when it was built.</p>
        <p>When it opened on Oct. 25, 1939, public officials thought it was the answer to the city's severe housing shortage.</p>
        <p>The buildings' designer said Queensbridge's seemingly endless rows of red-brick six-story buildings were built in a Y shape to ensure the economical use of the 47 acres on which the 26 buildings sit.</p>
        <p>To many poor people, Queensbridge, which is bordered by the Queensboro Bridge, 21st Street, 40th Avenue and Vernon Boulevard, was an oasis in the midst of the city's unkempt flats.</p>
        <p>Newspaper reports show that on the day the complex opened, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia hailed its amenities: the children's nursery, a baby clinic and the community center, which housed a branch of the Queens Borough Public Library, a gymnasium, social rooms and a kitchen.</p>
        <p>Housing Authority officials say Queensbridge now has more than 8,000 tenants. Across the country, many large public housing facilities are seen as crime-ridden failures and are being torn down. Residents say that Queensbridge, however, is thriving.</p>
        <p>While the notion of celebrating public housing might seem strange, given the problems of many projects, Nina D. Adams, president of the development's tenants' association, thinks the observance is appropriate.</p>
        <p>''You used to be scared to sit outside,'' Ms. Adams said. ''It's not a shoot'em-up at the O.K. corral like it used to be. All of that has calmed down.''</p>
        <p>These days, she says, a spirit of family and community reigns supreme among the residents. When asked about the area's lore, the community leader rolls off the names of former residents who have achieved success. Local legends include the rapper Nas; Dr. Bob Lee, a disc jockey for radio station WBLS; Pat Martin, basketball coach for Long Island University; and Ron Artest, a basketball star at St. John's who was drafted by the Chicago Bulls. Ms. Adams proudly said they are proof that good people live in public housing.</p>
        <p>''We have a lot of good people in our development,'' said Detective Robert Nero, who heads the Police Department's community affairs unit that serves the housing development.</p>
        <p>Detectives said major reported crimes in Queensbridge decreased 24 percent in the last year.</p>
        <p>For a few hours yesterday, the tenants created a carnival atmosphere in what some might see as normally dreary surroundings. Gospel, hip-hop and rhythm and blues filled the air as friends and neighbors socialized, danced and ate together at the anniversary celebration.</p>
        <p>The bridge may cast a physical shadow on the development, said Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, who presented community leaders with a congratulatory proclamation from the city, but it does not overshadow the tenants' spirit. ''This is a strong neighborhood standing on its own,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To ensure that Queensbridge residents can compete in the work world, Ms. Adams said, she is organizing adult education programs. Computer and sewing classes, summer day camps and a nursery are currently available.</p>
        <p>Ms. Adams says that problems within Queensbridge are no different than those in other places.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing wrong with public housing,'' Ms. Adams said. ''It's what you make of yourself. It's not where you live. It's what you do.''</p>
