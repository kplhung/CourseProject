        <p>ONE of the most cherished fables about the origin of movies -- true, as far as I know, but nonetheless bearing the patina of myth -- involves the showing of the Lumiere brothers' ''L'Arrive d'un Train en Gare'' in the basement of a Paris cafe in 1895.

        <p>ONE of the most cherished fables about the origin of movies -- true, as far as I know, but nonetheless bearing the patina of myth -- involves the showing of the Lumiere brothers' ''L'Arrive d'un Train en Gare'' in the basement of a Paris cafe in 1895. As the locomotive on the screen grew larger and larger, the audience screamed in terror and cowered behind their seats, as if the train were about to run them over.</p>
        <p>This anecdote is beloved by critics and historians both as an example of the charming naivete of the 19th-century public and as an illustration of the power of what would become the dominant medium of the 20th century. Of course, no train can arrive before the tracks are laid, and the Lumieres' achievement, simultaneously duplicated by Thomas A. Edison in a New Jersey shed, depended on the prior existence of photographic technology, and on a fascination with projected imagery dating back at least to the camera obscura craze of the early 19th century.</p>
        <p>The movies arrived at a moment of frantic technological advance. It was also an era intoxicated with the notion of reality, and thrilled by the vertiginous confusion of reality with illusion -- an era of literary naturalism and, in the United States, trompe l'oeil painting. So the cowering spectators in the Grand Cafe may have been more sophisticated in their terror than we think, and may resemble today's moviegoers and television viewers more than we care to admit. Their confusion may not have been a mistake, in other words, but a willed and sought-after sensation. One of the reasons we go to the movies, after all, is to be fooled by the truth.</p>
        <p>Like the first moviegoers, we live in an era of dizzying technological change. And like them, we display an appetite for reality matched only by our craving for fantasy. The movies and their progeny have fed and whetted both of these hungers. The Lumiere brothers screened what amounted to some of the first documentaries in 1895. A few years later, in ''A Trip to the Moon,'' Georges Melies invented cinematic surrealism and science fiction in a single stroke by firing a bullet into the eye of the man in the moon. Since their inception, the movies have cast a double spell: they capture reality, but they also counterfeit it. They allow us to see, and also to dream.</p>
        <p>And often they induce us to forget the difference between seeing and dreaming. In ''Cinema Verite,'' Peter Wintonick's eager new documentary about documentaries, some of the legendary figures in nonfiction filmmaking return again and again to their craft's technical, ethical and epistemological dilemmas. Does a documentary belong to its director or its subjects? Does it discover or invent? ''It's all manipulation,'' Frederick Wiseman snaps when asked about his work, which is famous for its unmediated presentation of lived reality.</p>
        <p>Of course, the feeling of authenticity that was the cinema verite movement's holy grail was a product of techniques and rules as rigorous as the choreography of an MGM musical or the editing of a Hitchcock thriller. Like today's Dogma filmmakers, the documentarians of the 50's and 60's operated under self-imposed taboos: no voice-over narration, no music, no interviews. And like Dogma, cinema verite attacked the very notion of directorial style. But style is its greatest legacy: the jumpy spontaneity of the handheld camera is now a staple of music videos, television series and commercials. And the resources of this style are more widely available than ever, as video cameras become ever smaller and easier to use, and the cumbersome and expensive process of editing becomes, like everything else, a matter of dragging, pointing and clicking.</p>
        <p>Pessimists worry that the digitalization of the medium spells the end of movies. Utopians prophesy their ultimate democratization. People everywhere, it's often said, will soon be able to grab a camera and tell their own stories, without spending tedious years trying to secure financing and round up a crew. This has been going on for some time, with the most visible results being ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' and the explosion of the amateur porn industry.</p>
        <p>The rise of reality programming -- from ''Cops'' to ''Survivor'' -- has provoked a lot of intriguing discussion, much of it anxiously moralistic. What does the popularity of such fare say about us? Have privacy, good taste and the sense of shame that makes civilization possible all vanished utterly? Has life become a spectacle? Or does the hunger for a window into reality, however begrimed, bespeak a more humane, ennobling curiosity about other people?</p>
        <p>Is there, in other words, a continuum between the trivial and the profound? Sorting through the clamor surrounding ''Survivor,'' and the hype attending Lars Von Triers's ''Dancer in the Dark,'' I can't help but think about two of the best movies I've seen this year, Jim McKay's ''Our Song'' (still making the rounds on the festival circuit and, if we are lucky, soon to find a distributor) and Zhang Yimou's ''Not One Less.'' Both follow, without making a big deal of it, some of the tenets of cinema verite and Dogma 95. Mr. Zhang made his story of an obstinate schoolteacher in rural China with a cast of peasants and city-dwellers, sometimes using a hidden camera to capture moments of unguarded emotion and intimacy. Mr. McKay spent a year in the Brooklyn neighborhood where his film is set, absorbing its sounds and textures with ethnographic precision and writerly sympathy. Both of these movies are works of fiction, acts of storytelling whose discovery of the world has the force of revelation.</p>
        <p>Are they true? Do they depict experience or counterfeit it? These questions, when applied to genuine works of art, are a philosophical dead end. We know the truth when we see it. Reality is banal. Realism is magic.</p>
