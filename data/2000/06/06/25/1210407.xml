        <p>The strawberries are off the vine, the Pimm's Cups are on ice, the grass courts await their yearly trampling, and the Duke and Duchess of Kent have trophies for everyone who survives the world-famous fortnight: prime time to revisit the top three Wimbledon nightmares of Martina Navratilova, who can't get enough of the temple of tennis, awake or asleep.</p>
        <p>This year she's not only co-anchor for the Wimbledon newcomer TNT, which with CNN/Sports Illustrated has slotted 89 hours of tennis programming between yesterday and July 9, but she has also emerged from virtual retirement to put her reputation back on the line by entering the Ladies Doubles event. As NBC's John McEnroe proved with last year's Mixed Doubles spree alongside Steffi Graf, stodgy old Wimbledon loves on-court moonlighting by former champions turned broadcasters.</p>
        <p>But before exploring Ms. Navratilova's ambitious summer agenda, which also includes induction into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I., back to those recurring nightmares, apparently an occupational hazard at Wimbledon: ''Mind you, anyone who's ever played here has had a few,'' Ms. Navratilova noted during a metropolitan area pit stop. ''The place overwhelms.''</p>
        <p>In the first, she's playing Virginia Wade, the home-grown British heroine, and suddenly she can't see the ball because trees are sprouting from the grass like giant mushrooms. In the second, her wristband gets stuck as she yanks it on, welding her fingers together like a claw, the umpire refuses her pleas for a time out, and she's forced to play with a muzzled hand. In the third, a variation on the dreaded can't-get-a-grip theme, she finds herself trying to grasp a distorted racquet straight out of ''The Twilight Zone'': it's shaped like a bionic tuning fork, very long but very thin, so there is no way for her to wrap her fingers around it.</p>
        <p>''I make myself wake up when I have that one,'' said Ms. Navratilova who, by the way, dreams in English, not her native Czech. As for broadcasting nightmares, she's had a few: sitting in the booth and hearing the crowd cheer for a different Martina, the Swiss teenager Martina Hingis, was disorienting, even irritating, the first time it happened. And filling in the dead, damp air time those inevitable Wimbledon washouts create is always traumatic.</p>
        <p>But for the most part, Wimbledon has been a dream come true for Ms. Navratilova, the iconoclastic 43-year-old lefty who defected from the former Czechoslovakia at 18, was outed by the nosy news media, and has made headlines as a standard-setting tennis champion and standard-bearing gay rights champion ever since.</p>
        <p>What makes Ms. Navratilova a cogent commentator?</p>
        <p>''Martina is the best at saying just what she thinks; she does not bend what she sees, and that makes for a very refreshing listen,'' said the Turner Sports senior vice president and executive producer Mike Pearl, who described himself as thrilled by his network's affiliation with Wimbledon. ''It provides a certain cachet to the network to be a member of that sporting event's family,'' added Mr. Pearl, who has assembled an eclectic Wimbledon broadcast team that includes the seasoned tennis commentators Mary Carillo, Tim Ryan and Barry MacKay, plus Marv Albert and Ernie Johnson. There's also the recently retired Jim Courier, the 1993 runner-up to the six-time Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sampras, who seems as allergic to the red clay Paris's Roland Garros Stadium as Ivan Lendl once was to Wimbledon's grass, is poised to make all-time history if he defends his Wimbledon title for his 13th Grand Slam trophy. Last year's emotional Wimbledon finale against Andre Agassi brought Mr. Sampras his 12th career slam, tying him with the Australian Hall of Famer Roy Emerson.</p>
        <p>According to Ms. Navratilova, ''If Pete is healthy, he's absolutely the favorite to win, and things on the men's side will be kind of predictable; if he loses, then the men's side is totally unpredictable.'' As for the women, ''Hingis and Davenport, the two top girls, are the ones to watch, but either of the Williams sisters could pull through and win if they stay healthy. They've got the talent, just maybe not this year.''</p>
        <p>Here's why Ms. Navratilova believes she's well-qualified to prognosticate at Wimbledon and, for that matter, every place else: ''Because I've won all of them and I've lost all of them.'' But this is ''the one that tugs my heartstrings.''</p>
        <p>She has always been acutely aware that Wimbledon offers tennis in a Tiffany setting: it remains the sport's crown jewel, a patch of greensward where rain-kissed roses bloom on cue each June, white is forever mandatory for apparel, tea is taken in midafternoon, players learn to bow and curtsy to a royal audience, and patient fans line up daily in a miles-long human caterpillar for the privilege of scoring a ticket.</p>
        <p>That's why she keeps two clumps of grass she harvested there, one from the historic Center Court where she captured her record nine singles championships and one from the defunct Court One, in a jewelry box locked in a safe.</p>
        <p>That's also why, before the tournament starts, she makes a solo trip to Center Court to ''sit on the grass and feel the ghosts of tennis past.'' She envisions Helen Wills Moody, whose Wimbledon singles record she eclipsed, and Suzanne Lenglen, the French champion who brought style to the game long before Ms. Navratilova wore her signature white shorts. The thing she remembers most about her own 1973 debut is that ''I was wearing an uncomfortable dress, but I won my match.''</p>
        <p>''And then,'' she adds, ''a Czech guy, Jan Kodes, won the whole tournament.'' She took that as a good omen.</p>
        <p>Ms. Navratilova denies her summer doubles stint with Mariaan de Swardt is an attempt to secure a record 20th Wimbledon title, tying her with her mentor, Billie Jean King.</p>
        <p>''Let's get serious: if I was trying to tie or break it, I would have been playing doubles and mixed for the last three years,'' she said. Or she would have entered singles too. ''I've thought about what a monkey that would put in the wrench -- or however the saying goes -- if I played singles now, because you have to be retired from singles five years before you go into the Hall of Fame. Would they un-induct me? Well, don't worry, I'm not in good enough shape for singles.''</p>
        <p>Besides, her Wimbledon plate is full. As usual.</p>
