        <p>DRESSED modestly in his native collarless garb, occasionally fingering a strand of prayer beads, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, Iran's petroleum minister,  led a contingent of similarly reserved, gray-bearded men who together played the role of wild card last week during the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries here.</p>
        <p>When high oil prices drove OPEC to raise output in March, the Iranians, led by Mr. Zanganeh, publicly rebelled, complaining of  one too many late-night phone calls to negotiators from Bill Richardson, the American energy secretary. (Ultimately, they increased their country's exports.) Last week, however, with crude oil once above $30 a barrel and OPEC again under pressure to raise production, the Iranians quickly went along with the majority.</p>
        <p>After weathering the manic dips and rises of oil prices over the last 18 months, Mr. Zanganeh, like other OPEC representatives, craves stability, which he believes the plan to raise output by 708,000 barrels a day should afford. It also helped, Mr. Zanganeh said, that there were no more trans-Atlantic phone calls interrupting the talks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zanganeh, born in 1952, is a civil engineer by training. He became petroleum minister in 1997.</p>
        <p>First at a press briefing and then in his hotel suite, Mr. Zanganeh discussed the rationale behind OPEC's latest decisions and their impact on the global oil market. Following are excerpts from the conversation.</p>
        <p>NEELA BANERJEE</p>
        <p>Q. Have you had discussions with United States companies about developing new oil and gas fields?</p>
        <p>A. We have had many discussions with U.S. companies. But they have unacceptable limitations on their activity in Iran placed on them by the administration. I don't think it's good for open and free trade. It's a decision that goes against both sides. It deprives U.S. companies from participating in our projects. We have money to develop our fields, but we would prefer to have the participation of first-class foreign companies.</p>
        <p>Q. How did the atmosphere of this OPEC session vary from that of the last one, which seemed full of tension?</p>
        <p>A. We had a very good atmosphere this time. In our last meeting, all the members complained of U.S. intervention. We didn't feel external political pressure this time.</p>
        <p>Q. How did OPEC arrive at the figure of 708,000 barrels a day?</p>
        <p>A. It was a compromise, and we will support it and respect it. We ourselves will be producing 104,000 barrels a day more. The decision was not hard, because we had decided before that if the price got up to $30 a barrel, we would increase production by 500,000 barrels a day.</p>
        <p>And it's all very close: a matter of oil being $2 more a barrel than $30 and producing 200,000 barrels more than 500,000 barrels. That is all much the same.</p>
        <p>We only validated our previous decision.</p>
        <p>Q. How would you respond to criticism from the United States and other nations that this agreement does not go far enough to dampen high oil prices?</p>
        <p>A. We felt we must be very careful in this situation to test the market. If the market needs more oil, we will produce it. We have an automatic mechanism for it. And there are only three months before our next meeting, which will give us time to see the effect of this decision. Step by step, we will test how much the market needs.</p>
        <p>We are looking for a stable price, not necessarily high or low.</p>
        <p>Now we are planning for oil to play a smaller role in our budget. We would like to use the revenues from oil to create funds that would support our private sector.</p>
        <p>Q. What is the automatic mechanism you have now within OPEC to increase production if your latest decision does not bring down oil prices? And why is there so much secrecy around it?</p>
        <p>A. This is what you call a gentlemen's agreement. Let's just say that.</p>
