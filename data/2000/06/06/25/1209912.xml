        <p>The beauty of Bartholomew Gill's Irish police procedurals (all 14 of them) has as much to do with their internal complexity as with their surface charms and graces. The beguiling narrative of THE DEATH OF AN IRISH LOVER (Morrow, $23) takes us to the ''storybook village'' of Leixleap, where the well-heeled international anglers who put up at the great stone inn can fish for fast-running salmon in the River Shannon and have a bit of fun in the pub next door. Not even the crime of passion that bloodies the carpet in one of the inn's bedrooms -- where two officers with the Shannon River Fisheries Board are shot to death while in flagrante -- ruffles the tranquillity. The senior officer was a notorious rake, after all, and what's a cuckolded husband supposed to do?</p>

        <p>The beauty of Bartholomew Gill's Irish police procedurals (all 14 of them) has as much to do with their internal complexity as with their surface charms and graces. The beguiling narrative of THE DEATH OF AN IRISH LOVER (Morrow, $23) takes us to the ''storybook village'' of Leixleap, where the well-heeled international anglers who put up at the great stone inn can fish for fast-running salmon in the River Shannon and have a bit of fun in the pub next door. Not even the crime of passion that bloodies the carpet in one of the inn's bedrooms -- where two officers with the Shannon River Fisheries Board are shot to death while in flagrante -- ruffles the tranquillity. The senior officer was a notorious rake, after all, and what's a cuckolded husband supposed to do?</p>
        <p>But the Garda's chief investigator, Peter McGarr, is too shrewd about the subtle ways of his countrymen to settle for the obvious conclusion. Alerted to local political undercurrents and social tensions by a garrulous barman, a onetime Irish Republican Army troublemaker who now dispenses wisdom ''like some fallen priest in a public confessional,'' McGarr uncovers more malignant mischief, from the systematic eel poaching that could kill off the regional fishing industry to the I.R.A. militancy that could destroy something even more precious to Leixleap. The contradictions Gill manages to unearth in one small, placid patch of Irish ground are simply astonishing.</p>
        <p>Patricia Carlon's first principle of psychological suspense -- you are at your most vulnerable when you are alone -- gets a workout in THE UNQUIET NIGHT (Soho, $22), the terrifying story of a woman who is being pursued by a homicidal stalker. Rachel Penghill, a jewelry designer who lives alone above her shop in a small Australian town, has no idea that the man she encounters in a nature preserve has just come from strangling a girl -- which heightens the horror when he panics and decides to kill her. ''He had to find out where she lived and wait till dark. That was all. And get her out in the dark alone.'' Although the steps he takes to find her are madly erratic, Rachel is already isolated in this narrow-minded town. One by one, in tiny increments of miscalculation and sheer cruelty, people who might help her choose not to extend themselves for this ''bossy and independent'' woman. In the end, that's the cut that really wounds, ''the terrible knowledge that she was so tiny, so unimportant a cog in the world that she could disappear without comment.''</p>
        <p>''The old days of mob arrogance were fading fast,'' Jon A. Jackson dryly informs us in LA DONNA DETROIT (Atlantic Monthly, $24). ''The modern mobster needed a slimmer, less obnoxious profile.'' To this end, Detroit's devious mob boss Humphrey DiEbola decides to clean up his corporate act, a process that entails downsizing his work force, moving huge amounts of money to secret bank accounts, making peace with old foes like Joe Service (an independent contractor who provides dubious but useful ''service to the underworld'') and putting his protegee, the lovely Helen Sedlacek, in charge of his legitimate enterprises. Helen starts by overhauling the boss's shabby cigar factory to produce a stogie of near-Cuban quality that attracts the wary notice of Sgt. Fang Mulheisen, who eventually steps in to upset all of Humphrey's cunningly laid plans.</p>
        <p>Although Mulheisen jogs through this caper without breaking a decent sweat, Humphrey's elaborate retirement plan (inspired, he claims, by the teachings of Machiavelli) is a masterpiece of diabolic design. The mob boss is some piece of work himself -- one of those deep-thinking, task-focused, loose-screwed master criminals who keep edging this series onto bolder levels of ironic wit. When Humphrey calls Jimmy Hoffa's death ''a misunderstanding,'' the moment is sublime.</p>
        <p>No matter where the historical mystery wanders -- to imperial Rome, Victorian London or any of the American states after the Civil War -- it is bound to run across some woman with anachronistic views on the rights of her sex to a formal education, gainful employment and ''a sense of freedom.'' In THE BLAZING TREE (Signet, paper, $5.99), by Mary Jo Adamson, that progressive advocate is a schoolteacher in the 19th-century Shaker village of Hancock, Mass., where an arsonist is at work. When a Boston crime reporter infiltrates this insular community, where celibacy is the first rule of order, a very unspiritual romance develops. Happily, it does not consume the story, which opens a window on a long-vanished society's extraordinary life and remarkably productive work. In the spirit of Mother Ann Lee, the founder of the Shakers in America, who believed mankind capable of making its own heaven on earth, Adamson creates a glowing portrait of a beautiful, if fatally flawed, world.</p>
        <p>Hanging out with Stephanie Plum is like taking 6-year-old twins shopping -- the harder they try to behave themselves, the more chaos they leave in their wake. In her latest errant adventure, HOT SIX (St. Martin's, $24.95), Janet Evanovich's New Jersey bounty hunter totals a new car, attracts a homicidal maniac and botches a surveillance job so badly that the gangster she was staking out tries to hire her as his chauffeur. ''It's much more fun living with you,'' Stephanie's gung-ho grandmother says after three fugitives (one a potential boyfriend) break into their apartment. ''We never had men visiting in the middle of the night when I lived with your mother.''</p>
        <p>The zany complications of the plot begin to spin when the son of an international arms dealer is assassinated and a police call goes out on Stephanie's mentor, a sexy but decidedly sinister mercenary who dresses in shades of night and calls himself Ranger. Although the adorably brash heroine tries to be discreet (without sacrificing her wardrobe of man-eater dresses and ankle-strap ''slut shoes''), her sleuthing efforts on Ranger's behalf lead to run-ins with the rambunctious army of cops, killers and rival bounty hunters Evanovich gleefully puts on her tail. Luckily for Stephanie, the inventive mind that got her into this giddy mess is clever enough to dig her out of it.</p>
