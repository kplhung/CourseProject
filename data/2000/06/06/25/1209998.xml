        <p>'Let them eat cake.'' Those words have come ringing down the centuries as the height of hauteur. Marie Antoinette was never able to live them down, even after the queen followed her husband, Louis XVI, to the guillotine after the French Revolution. To this day, whenever a hardhearted trickle-downer suggests that a rising tide lifts all the boats, he or she is denounced for having ''an arrogant let-them-eat-cake attitude,'' unconcerned with the needs of the common people.</p>
        <p>She never said it. The source of this canard is the sixth book of ''The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau'': ''At length I recollected the thoughtless saying of a great princess, who, on being informed that the country people had no bread, replied, 'Let them eat cake.''' (The words, in French, read ''Qu'ils mangent de la brioche.'')</p>
        <p>However, these words were written in or about 1770, the same year the daughter of the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire arrived in France to marry its crown prince. Rousseau was attributing that saying to some other ''great princess.'' The truth about Marie was just the opposite: she recognized the need for austerity at court and reduced the royal household staff, but in so doing offended snooty nobles, who proceeded to down-mouth her for posterity. I get incensed at this historical linguistic injustice every time I look up the phrase.</p>
        <p>Nor is that the only never-said-it. Who can forget ''The Guard dies, but never surrenders'' (''Le Garde meurt, mais ne se rend pas'')? The Count Cambronne, the head of Napoleon's most loyal troops at the Battle of Waterloo, to whom it was attributed, went to his grave wishing we would forget it, because he insisted that he never said it. A half-century after the battle, the writer Edouard Fournier credited a reporter named Rougemont with the creation of the ringing phrase. It may be counter-apocryphal, but some say the count's battlefield response to a demand for surrender was the expletive ''merde!'' -- a favorite Hemingway word for excrement sometimes referred to in France as ''le mot de Cambronne.''</p>
        <p>These belated corrections are made here today because of a response received after a correction of a more recent misconception: Richard Nixon's never-said ''I have a secret plan to end the war.'' I challenged anyone to come up with a contemporary citation directly quoting the 1968 candidate saying it; nobody ever has.</p>
        <p>Because word got around the White House that great misattributions were being straightened out in this space, the following handwritten note came in from Samuel R. Berger, national security adviser: ''Bill -- Since you have asserted frequently that Bill Clinton is the 'architect of the strategic partnership' with Beijing, and because you are a stickler for the facts, I would like you to show me one instance in which the President describes the relationship as a strategic partnership.''</p>
        <p>Gee, could it be that Clinton is being unjustly saddled with a never-said-it? You can get hundreds of citation hits on the databases when you type in ''strategic partnership'' and ''Clinton.'' An article in Japan's daily Yomiuri Shimbun in 1998: ''Last year, Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited the United States, and this year, U.S. President Bill Clinton returned the visit. On both occasions, the two countries began using the term 'strategic partnership' between the two powers to describe their relationship.'' Robyn Lim wrote recently in The International Herald Tribune, ''Two years ago, Mr. Clinton announced a 'strategic partnership' with China.'' And a vituperative right-wing New York Times columnist (albeit a stickler for the facts) has been writing frequently of ''Clinton, architect of the discredited 'strategic partnership' with Beijing.'' Could we all be wrong?</p>
        <p>Berger goes on: ''On many occasions we have said that we would hope to develop a strategic partnership, i.e., described it as an aspirational goal. But there is a big difference between describing an objective for the future and what exists today. I can provide you what the President actually said in Beijing.''</p>
        <p>And so, upon my eager request, he did. On July 3, 1998, the president (Times style, unlike White House style, is to lowercase the name of the office) said in Hong Kong, ''My view is that the potential we have for a strategic partnership is quite strong.'' This followed by five days Jiang Zemin's usage: ''progress in the direction of building a constructive strategic partnership.''</p>
        <p>In each case, and in a dozen other citations provided by the White House, the Clinton context is, as Berger asserts, ''aspirational'' -- a hope for the future. If the future were the only context for the Clinton use of the phrase, then all of us who have been deriding the president as ''architect of the discredited policy of a strategic partnership'' -- as if it signified his notion of a present state of affairs -- would surely owe him and his advisers abject apologies.</p>
        <p>And yet there is the problem of the Clinton statement to business leaders in Shanghai on July 1, 1998, dutifully provided by the White House. Discussing normal trade treatment for China, an issue then known as M.F.N. (for ''most favored nation''), Clinton warned what would happen if Congress did not respond to his plea to vote to renew the normal treatment. ''Failure to renew that would sever our economic ties,'' he said, ''denying us the benefits of China's growth, endangering the strategic partnership, turning our back on the world's largest nation at a time when cooperation for peace and stability is more important and more productive than ever.''</p>
        <p>When Berger saw that citation, he must have uttered an American translation of le mot de Cambronne, but to his credit he did not remove it from the file. A close analysis of the structure of that sentence, especially its concluding ''at a time'' clause, indicates clearly that the president was speaking of the strategic partnership as something now in existence -- a current relationship that would be endangered if Congress failed to act as he wished. Had he only put prospective, potential or hoped-for in front of the key phrase, the Berger hypothesis would have been unchallengeable.</p>
        <p>You could say in Clinton's defense that he was adlibbing and intended to follow the agreed-upon future formulation but just slipped into the present tense on a single occasion. And it is undeniable that the other Clinton and Jiang citations follow the prospective-relationship formula.</p>
        <p>What's fair? We should recall the raw deals that loose historians have given the brioche-free Marie Antoinette, the die-hard count and the secret-plan-less Nixon. Unless other usages surface, accuracy-stickling Sinophobes should limit themselves to castigating ''the 'strategic partnership' that Clinton frequently hoped for and in one instance suggested his policy produced.''</p>
