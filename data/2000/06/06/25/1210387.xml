        <p>Kerry McCoy awoke this morning, rubbed the tattoo on his right arm and whispered to himself, ''This is what's it's all about.''</p>
        <p>The five Olympic rings had faded a bit since McCoy got the tattoo four years ago as a college wrestler who had one goal. He got the tattoo after he lost the Olympic trials in 1996, a bold reminder of a hope unfulfilled.</p>
        <p>Tonight the rings glistened in the crevices of his biceps. ''I'm glad I got it,'' McCoy said smiling. ''It's a little bit lighter, but still just as powerful.''</p>
        <p>McCoy, the reigning national heavyweight champion from Middle Island, N.Y., captured a berth on the United States Olympic freestyle wrestling team by defeating his nemesis, Stephen Neal, in two matches of the two-of-three-match final in Reunion Arena, 4-1 and 6-4.</p>
        <p>McCoy won by balancing the images on his arms. Written in Japanese on his left biceps are two characters that mean ''to dominate.'' McCoy, 25, a former New York high school champion, did just that.</p>
        <p>It was a night of redemption and emotion for the seven freestyle and eight Greco-Roman wrestlers who made the Olympic team. Only one of them, Melvin Douglas at 213.75 pounds in the freestyle division, participated in the 1996 Atlanta Games. The Games in Sydney, Australia, begin in September.</p>
        <p>Charles Burton won the right to wrestle Les Gutches, a 1996 Olympian, for the final freestyle spot, at 187.25 pounds. Gutches, the national champion, received an injury exemption and will wrestle Burton in three weeks to complete the freestyle team.</p>
        <p>The Greco-Roman team will be without one recognizable figure. Matt Ghaffari, 38, the most accomplished Greco-Roman heavyweight in the United States, finished his Olympic career a gold medal short.</p>
        <p>The exuberant Ghaffari was the last of the three Greco-Roman silver medalists to lose last night, as Rulon Gardner, the 28-year-old national champion, downed Ghaffari in overtime of the third match.</p>
        <p>It was Ghaffari's fifth overtime match in three days.</p>
        <p>''After five nine-minute matches, I just ran out of gas,'' Ghaffari said. ''I'm really sad I'm not representing this country at the Olympics.''</p>
        <p>He did not unlace the shoes and leave them on the mat. ''I don't want to retire with a loss,'' he said. ''I will be in New York City for the world championships next year.''</p>
        <p>Ghaffari had longed to defeat the Russian Aleksandr Karelin at the Olympics or world championships, and such talk had angered Gardner. ''I know Matt's been here and everybody likes Matt,'' Gardner said. ''But I don't care about the recognition. I just want to do the best I can.''</p>
        <p>Then Gardner reversed his opinion a bit. ''Hey, put Matt in the background, I want to be the man now,'' he said. ''Oh, he's the Olympic silver medalist, great, great. I won nationals. Wasn't that good enough?''</p>
        <p>It was tonight, as the top-seeded Gardner benefited from being 10 years younger.</p>
        <p>Steven Mays downed Brandon Paulson, 3-0 and 5-0, at 119 pounds, and Jim Grunwald defeated Dennis Hall in the rubber match, 8-3, at 127.75 pounds.</p>
        <p>McCoy made use of his advantage as the top-seeded freestyle heavyweight wrestler by virtue of his victory over Neal at the national championships. McCoy seemed fresher, having been able to rest for four days in Dallas because of his seeding.</p>
        <p>McCoy was a junior at Penn State when he got his Olympic tattoo, inscribing it for inspiration after losing to Kurt Angle at the 1996 national championships. But McCoy lost to Angle again at the Olympic trials and watched him win the gold medal in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>After 1996, the international wrestling federation dropped McCoy's weight class, 220 pounds, and he was forced to get bigger and stronger, moving up to heavyweight. He still gave up at least 10 pounds and two inches to Neal, but capitalized with his quickness. It was his third victory in four matches against Neal.</p>
        <p>''This year I made a concentrated effort to peak at the right time and it paid off,'' McCoy said. ''Right now I'm on the top of the world.''</p>
        <p>He had company.</p>
        <p>Terry Brands, who had an adrenaline injection, seemed to get better as he battled through the challenge tournament leading up the finals.</p>
        <p>Brands, who lost in the 1996 trials, outlasted Kerry Boumans tonight, both matches in overtime. ''I'm pumped up,'' Brands said.</p>
        <p>Garrett Lowney was smiling amd a bit dazed when he became the youngest wrestler, at 20, to make the Olympic team. He defeated the 1996 Olympian Jason Gleason, 3-0 and 3-0 in overtime, in the 213.75-pound class in the Greco-Roman division.</p>
