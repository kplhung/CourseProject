        <p>FOR many parents and educators in Yonkers, there was a sense of relief after Andre J. Hornsby, the school district's lightning rod of a superintendent, was fired. But among many of this city's long-disenfranchised black residents, Dr. Hornsby's firing has set off a groundswell of rage.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hornsby, the district's first black superintendent, was fired, they say, because he would not bend to the wishes of Mayor John D. Spencer and abandon his pursuit of a federal desegregation lawsuit. The suit could have brought millions in federal funds to Yonkers, Dr. Hornsby has said, just when the district is grappling with a $24 million budget gap.</p>
        <p>Yonkers is also struggling to hang on to improvements in student performance that just began to take hold this year with programs Dr. Hornsby created. The question now is how the upheaval at the top of the district will affect the classrooms.</p>
        <p>''We went from being the last in performance of the Big 5 city school districts in New York to being No. 3 in such a short time it's phenomenal,'' said Maria Chiulli, the school board vice president and one of three members who voted to keep Dr. Hornsby. ''What we made as Dr. Hornsby's goal, he did. In fact, he surpassed what we asked him to do. So now it's, 'Congratulations, you did a wonderful job, you're fired?' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Chiulli insisted, however, that a battle of egos between Dr. Hornsby and Mayor Spencer had precipitated the firing -- not racism.</p>
        <p>As for the future of Yonkers' 26,000 children, she said Dr. Hornsby's improvements will probably hold up -- but not indefinitely.</p>
        <p>''It will take some time to see the downfall where we're headed but not that long,'' she said. ''If you don't put someone like him back in there with the same goals and the same drive and the same knowledge, something gets lost. It's inevitable.''</p>
        <p>Few on the board dispute that Dr. Hornsby had made changes that appeared to be helping students. Bernadette Dunne, one of five school board members who voted to fire him, even called the iconoclastic educator ''a very brilliant man.'' The trouble, she said, was his ''people skills,'' specifically, his high-handed leadership style, which alienated swaths of the school community.</p>
        <p>In his place, the board has installed an interim superintendent, Joseph Farmer, a former teacher and principal in the district -- who is also black -- and has a reputation for being able to get along with people.</p>
        <p>Robert Ferrito, the school board president, insisted that the point was not to roll back Dr. Hornsby's improvements but to ''implement them with a happier face.''</p>
        <p>But some black leaders in Yonkers say, in the face of improved test scores, there can be no other logical reason for Dr. Hornsby's firing than his refusal to bend on the desegregation case.</p>
        <p>''I believe that if he had indicated that he saw no vestiges of segregation here, he would be in his job today,'' said the Rev. Darryl George, who heads the Messiah Baptist Church and has organized protests over Dr. Hornsby's firing. On Wednesday, he led a group of some 100 citizens to City Hall to demand a meeting with Mayor Spencer, he said. ''The mayor locked the doors and would not allow us to enter,'' Mr. George said. Protesters then blocked traffic and nine people were arrested, the police said.</p>
        <p>Mr. George said: ''John Spencer has now taken the city of Yonkers to a new low. You cannot even get into City Hall to make an appointment with him. What is happening with Rudy Giuliani in New York, guess what? He's got a little brother in Yonkers.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Spencer did not return phone calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>But what happens next?</p>
        <p>While Mr. Farmer tries to keep Yonkers schools on course, the board will begin searching for a new leader because Mr. Farmer has indicated he does not want the job.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferrito, the board president, said he would prefer to hire a candidate closer to home this time. Dr. Hornsby came from Texas after a nationwide search. ''I don't know if we're going to go through that again,'' he said. ''I think we need someone who can bring the district together, and I don't know that we have to go looking out of our backyard for that.''</p>
        <p>One name being unofficially bandied about is Michael Yazurlo, the former principal of Roosevelt High School in Yonkers, who is now the superintendent of the Tuckahoe school district. Mr. Yazurlo is popular with parents, who remember him taking a personal interest in difficult students and weeping with pride at their graduations. He is also friendly with the teachers union, which Dr. Hornsby had alienated.</p>
        <p>Maria George, a parent of two children in the district, was once a cautious supporter of Dr. Hornsby, ready for his prescription of radical change in the school. Now she just sounds weary. '' Will our kids now begin to fall through the cracks again?'' she said. ''Will they go back to the status quo? Apparently our mayor sees the segregation issue as a dead issue but the proof will be down the road, in how our children do.''</p>
        <p>Inside the Yonkers schools, those who signed on during Dr. Hornsby's tenure are unsure of their future. Mr. George said a number of black educators were planning to leave. One of those is Horace Williams, the principal of Lincoln High School.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Williams's guidance -- and that of his mentor, Dr. Hornsby -- Lincoln has undergone a noticeable change. There are fewer students hanging out in the hallways during class and test scores on the Regents exam taken in January rose sharply. The results on tests the students are taking now will not be known until the end of the summer.</p>
        <p>Will those improvements last under a new leader? Students interviewed recently said they were worried about the district's seemingly endless upheaval.</p>
        <p>But an assistant principal, Shango Blake, said all the controversy wouldn't change the basic mission of educators.</p>
        <p>''Right now, we're just dealing with the Regents tests,'' he said. ''Any uncertainty and anxiety, that's an adult thing. The students are just concentrating on passing.''</p>
