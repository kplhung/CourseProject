        <p>DELPHINE RED SHIRT grew up speaking Lakota, a Sioux language in which the word for children translates to ''sacred beings,'' and the translation for God is ''the energy in all living things.'' Although she's now far from Porcupine, the community on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota where she spent much of her childhood, the language is still part of her.</p>
        <p>In Guilford, where she lives with her husband, Richard Harding Shaw,  and their three children, she works to preserve Lakota, in all its richness and complexity, and to write down stories about the tribe that might otherwise be lost.</p>
        <p>After writing a memoir of her childhood, ''Bead on an Anthill: A Lakota Childhood,'' she began recording her mother's conversations in Lakota -- conversations that ended last year when her mother died, at age 79.</p>
        <p>''I knew her voice was important,'' said Ms. Red Shirt, who has transcribed and translated the conversations for a book, ''Turtle Lung Woman's Granddaughter.'' It is to be published, as was her memoir, by the University of Nebraska Press.</p>
        <p>For ''Granddaughter,'' she received support from the Endangered Language Fund, which is based in New Haven and aims to preserve languages not only for their speakers, but for all who can learn from them. The idea, said Douglas H. Whalen, president of fund, is to help save the history, ideas, cultural connections and linguistic information that are embedded in languages that are giving way to mainstream languages like English.</p>
        <p>At Pine Ridge, many people speak some Lakota, or at least understand it. However, said Ms. Red Shirt, who is fifteenth-sixteenth Sioux, ''They're losing people who spoke the language every day of their lives -- people who can express life in the language, who have the ability to express very complex concepts in Lakota.''</p>
        <p>''My mother knew these things, and she's gone,'' Ms. Red Shirt continued. ''In Porcupine, there are maybe three people left, in their 80's,'' who speak as her mother did.</p>
        <p>Younger speakers, she said, do not know the language ''intimately, as the old ones do.'' Her mother used English awkwardly, and only when she had to.</p>
        <p>Ms. Red Shirt's mother, Winyan Isnala (which means Lone Woman), was the granddaughter of the new book's title. Turtle Lung Woman, whose Sioux name was Keglezela Cagu Win, lived from 1851 to 1935. As Ms. Red Shirt recorded conversations, she captured history as well as language, for Winyan Isnala remembered Turtle Lung Woman's stories in great detail, going back to the 1860's.</p>
        <p>Turtle Lung Woman's accounts gave a woman's perspective on Sioux life and included topics that Ms. Red Shirt has not found covered elsewhere, such as life on the reservation in the 1930's.</p>
        <p>Visiting her mother at Pine Ridge in 1997, Ms. Red Shirt began her recording project as she drove her mother around to see family and friends. Winyan Isnala was happy to share her knowledge, and for months afterward the project continued by phone. The first day was especially memorable: Ms. Red Shirt had just turned on her tape recorder when an eagle swooped down and brushed the car with its wing, startling both women. Still, she recalled, ''My mother said it was a good sign.''</p>
        <p>Winyan Isnala told her daughter that Turtle Lung Woman ''seemed to embody everything she told me about the old ways. Her Lakota words reflected a different world view. The essence of everything we were was embedded in the words she spoke.''</p>
        <p>Turtle Lung Woman explained how, ''In the life of the Lakota before 1868, the people lived content, grateful for everything around them. We called ourselves Pte Oyate, or 'Female Buffalo People.' We depended on the buffalo for our way of life.''</p>
        <p>She spoke of making teepees of buffalo hides, of using buffalo brains to dye the hides, and of making moccasins for her husband, as the prepared to go to war against the Crow. Winyan Isnala herself remembered later years, when her grandmother had a small government pension and lived in a modest log house where people sat on deer hides on the floor. And she remembered what Turtle Lung told her -- ''that there was order in all things, meaning in all things. It was how the Lakota mind worked.''</p>
        <p>Often Ms. Red Shirt shows how the language has evolved. For instance, her great-grandmother had to move family belongings on a travois, called ''a horse pulls it.'' It was ''a dog pulls it'' before the horse, which was known as the ''sacred dog,'' was introduced on the Plains. She includes many Lakota words and their translations, including the words that mean ''calm and serene,'' and that describe a Sioux woman's way of mothering. Her aim, she said, has been to convey the essence of Lakota.</p>
        <p>''It was my first language,'' she said, and it has shaped her thoughts. She recalled how, growing up, she pondered that classic, young-person question, ''What is the the meaning of life?'' She found an answer, one that ''opened up a whole mindset,'' in the Lakota definition of a Creator who is ''the energy in all living things.''</p>
        <p>Although Ms. Red Shirt wrote poetry in her teens, and later won a national college poetry prize, she majored in accounting in college, then worked in accounting for many years.</p>
        <p>''I was afraid of poverty,'' she explained, after her family's years in a little Nebraska town and on the Pine Ridge Reservation. After she moved to Connecticut in 1992, however, she entered a master's program at Wesleyan University, where she began to write about Sioux life and to fill her work with the Lakota language. ''I found my voice,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Karen Lone Hill, who heads the department of Lakota studies at Oglala Lakota College on the Pine Ridge Reservation, said that Ms. Red Shirt's work provides a valuable record, one that may help people ''to better understand the Lakota language,'' which she added is ''very complex,'' but little studied by linguists.</p>
        <p>She noted that on the reservation, it's usually the very old people who regularly speak the language; the younger people are, the less likely they are to speak it. There is interest, however; Pine Ridge offers Lakota classes from elementary school through college.</p>
        <p>''We want to keep the Lakota language active,'' said Ms. Lone Hill, who noted the need for more recording of lifelong speakers.</p>
        <p>Linguists see each language as a window on the human mind. They need diverse sources as they look into the nature and possibilities of human language, said Dr. Whalen.</p>
        <p>''Every scrap we can glean from the language diversity that exists now, and will not in the very near future, contributes to our probing of our own capabilities,'' said Dr. Whalen, who works at the Yale-affiliated Haskins Laboratories, where research focuses on speech and language.</p>
        <p>The Endangered Language Fund is now making its grants for this year; its 1999 grants included Ms. Red Shirt's (and 11 others, for work involving languages spoken in Borneo and Nepal, among other places). Dr. Whalen said there was ''a large dose of urgency'' in Ms. Red Shirt's project, since her mother died soon after she applied for a grant. That left no way to supplement the recordings, he said, so it became especially important to undertake ''the hard work of transcribing them, and making them accessible.''</p>
        <p>With her grant money, Ms. Red Shirt hired someone to watch her toddler while she transcribed the tapes. ''That was real, practical support to preserve a language,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Speaking The Language</p>

        <p>Waci nihci -- a very long time ago.</p>
        <p>Waci t'aka ye -- be patient.</p>
