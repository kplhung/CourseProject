        <p>With concert ticket prices skyrocketing, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center offers a program that is bound to deliver value. The Chieftains and Los Lobos, two Grammy-winning bands whose foundations are in ethnic music, perform in Newark at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Los Lobos has been recording Latin rock for 26 years. That's the thinking-person's brand, not the ear candy of Ricky Martin. Los Lobos play their own style of Tex-Mex-Chicano rock known for its accordion and guitar substructure. Formed in Los Angeles, the band mixed zydeco with early-rock influences creating a rousing new sound. Cult and critical favorites, they had a No. 1 hit in 1987 with their title track to the movie ''La Bamba.'' It was the first Spanish song to reach the top of the charts. In 1992, they released the innovative ''Kiko,'' utilizing sound experimentation along with Cajun, rock, and soul influences.</p>

        <p>The Chieftains have been regarded as the most popular exponents of traditional Irish music for close to 40 years. They have burrowed the depth of traditional Irish music creating a distinctive style that defined and deconstructed the genre. They began as a folk group but have since captured a worldwide rock audience through their astounding range and collaborations with such diverse artists as Van Morrison and the Rolling Stones. The bond in this seemingly dissimilar booking is the Chieftains' foray into Spanish music, which they recorded in 1996 on ''Santiago.''</p>
