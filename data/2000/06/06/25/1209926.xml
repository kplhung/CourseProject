        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I disagree with Perry Meisel's assertion, in his essay ''Let a Hundred Isms Blossom'' (May 28), that ''literary study in America has never been in better shape.'' As a graduate student at N.Y.U., I felt anything but liberated. Although the literary criticism of the ''old boys'' excluded the perspectives of women, minorities and poor people, the revolutionaries Meisel speaks of have become as smug as the people they overthrew. The latest wave of criticism has robbed texts of meaning while reducing masterpieces to abstract asides in articles that posit ridiculous theories.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I disagree with Perry Meisel's assertion, in his essay ''Let a Hundred Isms Blossom'' (May 28), that ''literary study in America has never been in better shape.'' As a graduate student at N.Y.U., I felt anything but liberated. Although the literary criticism of the ''old boys'' excluded the perspectives of women, minorities and poor people, the revolutionaries Meisel speaks of have become as smug as the people they overthrew. The latest wave of criticism has robbed texts of meaning while reducing masterpieces to abstract asides in articles that posit ridiculous theories.</p>
        <p>By denying the importance of the author or the possibility of intentional meaning, the discussion surrounding literature has turned into a roomful of critics dancing by themselves, imposing their intellectual constructs onto innocent Shakespearean sonnets.</p>
        <p>It is now nave to hazard a guess about what a book ''means'' without bringing Fish, Derrida and Foucault along with you. Politics and linguistics have replaced aesthetics. The need for new critical tools came when professors were measured by what they could publish, and the number of texts was limited. With the new lenses of the ''isms'' we got permission to look at the same books again and again from contrived angles.</p>
        <p>I propose that we find new authors instead of new critics and leave those soloists to themselves.</p>
