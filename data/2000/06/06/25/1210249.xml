        <p>New York City schoolchildren continue to lag badly in math, with less than a third of all students meeting city and state standards in math, according to test results released last week by the Board of Education.</p>
        <p>Though testing experts predicted that scores would rise considerably this year, as students and teachers became familiar with new tests introduced last year, the percentage of students meeting standards increased by only one percentage point.</p>
        <p>Many schools have been wrestling with new math programs introduced in the last few years, and the inconclusive test rsults will do little to put to rest the debate that has emerged on this new approach.</p>
        <p>These new math program are designed to reach more students by introducing games and exercises to help them construct and intuitive understanding of math concepts. But some parents and educators have complained that the program gives short shrift to traditional math concepts and skills.</p>
        <p>School officials called attention to the fact that the percentage of students scoring at the lowest of four levels of proficiency (the score a student is given even if all the answers are wrong) declined from 34 to 31 percent, a decline of 3 percentage points, with a steeper decline in schools taken over by the Chancellor for poor performance.</p>
        <p>But even so, these results remained discouraging: 95,000 students out of more than 300,000 tested scored at this extremely low level, nearly as many as scored a passing grade.</p>
        <p>On this page and the following pages are separate tables of scores for students at elementary and middle schools across the city for grades 3, 5, 6 and 7. The results of a similar state test administered to fourth and eighth graders have not yet been released.</p>
        <p>STUDENTS TESTED The number of students who took the test, including special-education students. Results for schools with fewer than 20 students tested are not shown.</p>
        <p>INCOME Percentage of students who did not qualify for free school lunch, based on Federal income guidelines in 1999. The higher the number, the higher the income.</p>
        <p>RANK The city's schools were ranked based on the percentage of students meeting city and state standards as computed by The New York Times. Special-education schools are not included. The highest ranking is 1.</p>
        <p>PERFORMANCE LEVELS Percentage of students in each category on the city's test for students in third, fifth, sixth and seventh grades administered this spring.</p>
        <p>Levels are ranked from 1 (lowest) to 4. Students at Levels 1 and 2 and fall below performance standards. Those at Level 1 have serious deficiencies, and those at Level 2 do not have full mastery of the standards. Students at Level 3 and 4 meet or exceed the standards.  PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE Shows the change in the percentage of students who scored at Level 3 or 4, compared with tests administered in spring 1999. Last year's scores were recalculated by the Board of Education to match the new reporting format.</p>
        <p>PERCENTAGE MEETING STANDARDS The black bar shows the percentage of students who scored at Level 3 or 4.</p>
        <p>NOTES District 85 schools have been taken over by the Chancellor for poor performance. District 75 Schools serve special-education Students. District 78 schools are run by the city's high school division, rather community districts. Blanks indicate missing data. An asterisk after a school's name indicates that it is administered by the Board of Education rather than a community school district, and that it is not included in a district's summary totals. Summary totals were calculated separately for elementary and middle schools from the available data.</p>
