        <p>THE prospect of having the million cars that fill the Island's roads every rush hour grow to more than 1.3 million is enough to make even hardy commuters weep.</p>
        <p>But that is precisely what Department of Transportation officials have predicted for 2020. So to prevent the frightening but very real possibility of even nastier traffic snarls, the department set out three years ago to come up with a plan for managing the inevitable congestion.</p>
        <p>After sorting through hundreds of suggestions from local officials and residents, officials came up with alternatives that included charging tolls on all the Island's highways, building carpool lanes on the Southern State Parkway and making the Northern State Parkway a road where only cars carrying two or more passengers could ride free.</p>
        <p>But ultimately, the agency's consultants found through computer modeling that those alternatives would not be as effective as one that would essentially mean widening dozens of roads across the island and an express bus system running on an elaborate network of highway lanes and entrance ramps built just for buses. This basic proposal would cost an estimated $310 million a year -- $120 million for roads, $190 million for the bus network -- or $6.2 billion over the 20-year program.</p>
        <p>Transit advocates and environmentalists reacted harshly when officials presented their preliminary findings this month.</p>
        <p>''They spent $7 million -- a huge amount -- for this planning process, and this is what they came up with?'' said Lisa Tyson, associate director of the Long Island Progressive Coalition and a member of the advisory committee for the traffic study. ''All across the country, people are doing innovative things, but all Long Island can get is wider roads and more buses?''</p>
        <p>Transportation officials defended their findings and noted that the process has been long and expensive precisely because they solicited ideas from the public and evaluated their suggestions. (Those suggestions ranged from flying blimps to carry commuters and making public transportation free, to old chestnuts like expanded parking at train stations and light-rail trains or trolleys along highways and main thoroughfares.)</p>
        <p>Local officials who served on the 41-member advisory committee said they would reserve judgement until they could study the package. But they said that given the limited options available to an island where the car is king, the plan may well be the best way to keep traffic manageable.</p>
        <p>''To the extent that reasonable proposals can be envisioned now for the future, it probably deals sufficiently with congestion,'' said Robert W. Shinnick, the director of transportation operations for Suffolk County. ''They even admit that the roads will still be congested, but they won't be as bad had they not made any attempt to deal with it.''</p>
        <p>While expanded public transportation would help ease congestion, he added, it would never be a total solution because the car culture is so strong. ''People have a tremendous investment in what they have and the way they live,'' he said. ''So by and large, we're going to have automobiles here for a long, long time. It's the lay of the land.''</p>
        <p>The proposals, known as the Long Island Transportation Plan 2000, can only move forward after approval by the advisory committee, which is made up mainly of county and local officials.</p>
        <p>Transportation officials said that the plan would be refined with the committee's suggestions and that public hearings would be held before a final proposal goes to the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council for approval, probably next summer. The council includes officials from New York City and its surrounding suburban counties, but is led by the Department of Transportation. Projects proposed by the council generally meet little opposition.</p>
        <p>Critics said they feared that because public support for the proposed bus system would probably be scant, the road widenings would eventually be left as the only real option. While transportation officials called the road improvements ''modest in scale'' and noted that they would affect only 15 percent of the Island's highway miles, they include stretches of virtually every major county and state road.</p>
        <p>''I think it portends a nightmarish traffic future for Long Island,'' said Janine Bauer, executive director for the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a transit advocacy group. ''Considering we had to pull every trick we could think of just to keep Long Island Bus running this year, the transit half of this proposal probably won't go forward -- but the road expansions will.''</p>
        <p>The bus system in Nassau County went through months of uncertainty after the county cut its annual subsidy by $12.5 million, and it was preserved only after state legislators found additional funds.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bauer predicted that many of the widenings would turn into battles with homeowners and environmentalists. ''By recommending transit alternatives that are too expensive and unpopular,'' she said, ''the Department of Transportation will have gotten away with the plan it always intended, which is just to widen roads.''</p>
        <p>Wayne Ugolick, the D.O.T. official serving as the technical director of the study, said he was disappointed and a little surprised by the negative response.</p>
        <p>''It's possible that some people are disappointed to not see their favorite option advanced,'' he said. ''But while this study was founded in the public process, it also uses sound forecasting tools, so that rather than only listening to the people who shout the loudest, we're evaluating different alternatives to find the most effective approach to managing congestion.''</p>
        <p>The transportation department's consultants said the unenthusiastic response to the express bus proposal may have been caused in part by a misunderstanding of how extensive and elaborate the system would be.</p>
        <p>''It's very hard to visualize because it's not like any kind of bus system that most people are familiar with,'' said Marvin Gersten, of the engineering and consulting firm Parsons Brinkerhoff.</p>
        <p>Unlike existing bus lines, where waiting times are often 30 minutes or longer, the new lines would keep waiting times to about six minutes. Bus priority lanes would be built on expressways and parkways, but they would be more efficient than existing high-occupancy lanes because special ramps would help buses avoid traffic.</p>
        <p>The study envisions about 38 locations where ramps, bus stations and park-and-ride lots would be built. The average cost for each such facility would be $8.5 million, and they would be built over roads like the Long Island Expressway, Route 110, the Meadowbrook Parkway and the Sagtikos State Parkway. The proposed bus network would include 34 new routes in Suffolk, 13 in Nassau and 3 in Queens.</p>
        <p>One of the most expensive and possibly most controversial aspects would be the need to widen Southern State and raise more than 20 of the picturesque stone bridges to accommodate buses. ''We recognize it's a major construction project and we may not be able to do it, based on community opposition,'' Mr. Gersten said. An alternative would be to use smaller buses or vans along the parkway.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ugolick noted that 45,000 to 50,000 people are expected to ride express buses during the morning rush hour. ''When you consider that about 85,000 people ride the Long Island Rail Road currently, that shows just how big a population the express buses would be serving,'' he said. ''It does a terrific job of reducing congestion.''</p>
        <p>The consultants also examined a system that combined express buses with a light-rail system that would run in a 43-mile loop along the Long Island Expressway, Route 110, Sunrise Highway and the Meadowbrook. But they determined that not only would construction costs be prohibitive, but that there would not be enough demand to sustain such a system. Many travelers would have to transfer from an express bus just to reach the light rail, an inconvenience that would discourage ridership.</p>
        <p>But Paul L. Matus, editor of an Web site on rapid transit and chairman of a citizens committee that reviewed transit options for the study, said the light-rail proposal the consultants chose ''was set up to fail.'' He said he found it hard to believe that people would prefer buses to light rail, adding that riders usually find trains more attractive because they are faster and nonpolluting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Matus said he was puzzled by the decision to route light rails along parkways and expressways instead of into Suffolk or through the Nassau hub of Hempstead, Garden City and Roosevelt Field. ''People don't live on parkways and expressways,'' he said, ''so they were guaranteeing that it wouldn't serve people directly.''</p>
        <p>Many local officials, however, agreed with the transportation department's assessment. ''Light rail would probably never come to pass because it's too expensive and construction would be a nightmare,'' said Thomas K. Smith, a supervisor in the Nassau County Planning Department and the county's representative on the study's advisory committee. He also pointed out that buses have an inherent flexibility that light-rail lines lack.</p>
        <p>''Once you build a light-rail system, you're locked into it,'' he said. ''With buses, as circumstances and land development changes, you can adjust and change routes to accommodate those changes.''</p>
        <p>Neil S. Yellin, president of Long Island Bus, said that he had not seen the bus proposal, but that he favored any program that would enhance the system and thus encourage people to get out of their cars.</p>
        <p>''From a planning perspective, the notion of high quality express bus service is a good way to go,'' he said. ''There's a saying that goes: buses for busloads and trains for trainloads. That means, if you start filling up buses, then you go the next step and look at light rail or a railroad.''</p>
        <p>Some ideas the transportation department decided not to pursue included highway tolls and a bridge to Connecticut. Tests of a toll system, which would have used electronic passes to charge drivers 15 cents a mile, showed that while the tolls would discourage some people from using their cars, congestion and traffic delays would actually increase.</p>
        <p>And the nine state senators from the Island sent a letter to the advisory committee this month saying tolls were unacceptable, effectively killing the idea because tolls would require approval from the Legislature.</p>
        <p>The consultants also considered bridges across the Sound from Sunken Meadow Parkway or Shoreham, but discarded the plans when testing showed that such a bridge would do virtually nothing to reduce rush-hour congestion.</p>
        <p>Some critics questioned the assumptions that the D.O.T. relied on as it set out to forecast the transportation needs of 2020. For example, the model took as a given that all currently proposed Long Island Bus and Long Island Rail Road expansions would be completed by 2020, including the railroad's access to Grand Central Terminal.</p>
        <p>''If you're going to predicate an entire study on everything that the M.T.A. says will be built, I think you're on quicksand,'' said Lawrence H. Silverman, chairman of the Long Island Rail Road Commuters Council and a member of the advisory committee. ''Using that to determine how much money should go into highway funds versus transit projects is faulty because you're counting on an awful lot of mass transit that might not ever materialize.''</p>
        <p>Others who hope to see an end to the seemingly limitless sprawl that is Long Island were disappointed that the study did not consider other land use patterns.</p>
        <p>''Why can't the state transportation department consider what should be appropriate development alongside roads that are going to be transportation corridors?'' said Stephen M. Jones, Suffolk County's planning director and a committee member.</p>
        <p>He suggested that just as the Department of Health instituted regulations in the early 1980's to protect groundwater that essentially limited development, the Department of Transportation could bar access along certain roads to keep traffic flowing smoothly. Limiting access to portions of roads like Route 25 and Route 347 might discourage development along the roads, and would help maintain them as transportation corridors, Mr. Jones said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ugolick said that the agency had heeded such concerns but concluded that the state should not interfere in local land-use decisions. ''If we were to try to tell a landowner that he couldn't develop his property or we restricted access to it, we would be hauled off to court so fast,'' he said. ''We don't have the authority to dictate land use from Albany.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones disagreed. ''The state agency is allowed to control access to state highways and it can be done without violating property owners rights,'' he said. ''It's an easy cop-out to say we can't do anything about land use.''</p>
        <p>Some residents who attended subcommittee meetings over the three years of the study said they had had high hopes that ideas from the public would survive the evaluation process, and were frustrated by the outcome.</p>
        <p>''We were all advised to think outside the box and it was all very gung-ho,'' said Keith J. Newberg, of North Merrick, who became involved because his former employer, Domino's Sugar in Brooklyn, was interested in finding ways to move cargo across the Island more efficiently. ''But I don't see anything that's outside the box here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ugolick said he understood the frustration. ''Some people are grounded in today and the problems they deal with everyday,'' he said, ''and others are grounded in the far future, where they envision Star Trekian solutions. Somewhere in the middle is where we have to be. I think ultimately Long Islanders will realize that this is the best way to do the plan.''</p>
