        <p>BLACK-EYED SALLY'S BBQ &amp; Blues in Hartford is good enough to be forgiven by true barbecue fans. Forgiven for what? For looking scrubbed and well-maintained. The grunge atmosphere, insisted on by some country barbecue fans as proof of authenticity, is missing at Sally's. Whatis evident is that the shellacked wood floors, tin-tiled walls and ceiling, butcher paper-topped tables and roomy booths are well taken care of,  and at night, when musicians are in residence (Wednesday through Saturday), the place throbs with live blues and blues rock.</p>
        <p>Sally's menu, which is more than just ribs 'n' sauce, features New Orleans dishes. This made it easy for those in our crowd who don't like beef brisket and such, to latch on to Obediah's chicken etouffee, jambalaya and blackened catfish.</p>

        <p>BLACK-EYED SALLY'S BBQ &amp; Blues in Hartford is good enough to be forgiven by true barbecue fans. Forgiven for what? For looking scrubbed and well-maintained. The grunge atmosphere, insisted on by some country barbecue fans as proof of authenticity, is missing at Sally's. Whatis evident is that the shellacked wood floors, tin-tiled walls and ceiling, butcher paper-topped tables and roomy booths are well taken care of,  and at night, when musicians are in residence (Wednesday through Saturday), the place throbs with live blues and blues rock.</p>
        <p>Sally's menu, which is more than just ribs 'n' sauce, features New Orleans dishes. This made it easy for those in our crowd who don't like beef brisket and such, to latch on to Obediah's chicken etouffee, jambalaya and blackened catfish.</p>
        <p>But first we had to have our Cajun popcorn fix. Sally's version consisted of nubbins of deep-fried, mildly seasoned Louisiana crawfish tails, which were irresistible, especially when dipped into a zesty Tennessee tartar sauce.</p>
        <p>To the Cajun popcorn we added a BBQ rib sampler, four meaty pork ribs, on which we rubbed some of Sally's red-hot Cajun beer barbecue sauce. Dynamite! The bourbon-and- molasses sauce was also peppy, but milder. Sally's well-seasoned, finely chopped carrot-flecked coleslaw, came with the ribs.</p>
        <p>Mavericks among us opted for N'awlins steamed mussels (in a flavorful white wine and lemony broth, along with andouille sausage, onions, garlic, tomatoes and herbs) and fried Maryland oysters with spicy pecans (superfluous), young greens and a wake-up dipe of jalapeno and horseradish.</p>
        <p>Generally speaking, Sally's offers tender palates plenty of slack, underdoing rather than overspicing various dishes. For example, the housemade andouille sausage was much milder than many Louisiana versions. Its presence in our jambalaya did little to jazz up an essentially bland medley of creole rice, shrimp, crawfish tails, tomatoes, peppers and okra. The jambalaya was disappointing on other grounds as well. Instead of the long-simmered dish we love, in which all the flavors fuse, this version tasted as though the seafood items had been popped in at the finale.</p>
        <p>Of all our entrees, best choices included the blackened catfish (spicing was judicious) with its tasty sides of oven-roasted sweet potatoes, collard greens and a cilantro-lime cream saucing.</p>
        <p>Especially fine value (in a place where everything is modestly priced to start with) was Sally's pig out at dinner, a huge portion of pulled pork and tender, sliced beef brisket, with pepperjack cheese grit and Memphis rice and beans. (In the smaller lunch version, piglet platter, the beef was dried out and the grits were cheeseless, however.)</p>
        <p>Obediah's chicken etouffee, on a bed of Carolina rice, was smothered in gravy, along with mushrooms, onions and peppers, but it could have used more sass.</p>
        <p>Sally's desserts (mostly too sweet for our tastes) were as much a trip down South as an old Muddy Waters' tune: sweet potato pie, Mississippi mud pie, bourbon pecan pie (heavy, oversugared and served ice cold). Best was the oven-warm peach and berry crisp with vanilla ice cream.</p>
        <p>Dinner for two cost $52, lunch for two $33, before tax, tip or drinks. Prices on the minimal wine list begin at $19.95. Better to head for the short beer list, which has both draft and micro-brewery choices that dovetail very well with the items on Sally's menu.</p>
        <p>Black-eyed Sally's BBQ &amp; Blues is a convenient lunch stop before a matinee at the Hartford Stage, a few blocks away. But dinner, especially when the blues or blues rock groups are on hand, can be a lot of fun.</p>
        <p>The music begins at 9 p.m.; there is a $5 to $8 cover charge, depending on the group. Johnny Rawls (July 8) and Sonny Rhodes (July 21-22) are among the performers to be heard during July.</p>
