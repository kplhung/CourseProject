The new length, from low calf to above the ankle, is accentuated with ankle-strap, high-heel sandals. In 1950, the same idea was popular at opulent balls. Some women, below and right, are wearing dresses from this period; others, left, contemporary versions of the look. It's all part of fashion's looking back to step forward.</p>
