        <p>STONE lions flank the heavy wooden entrance door to India House, for more than 16 years a welcome bit of brightness on a dreary stretch of the Albany Post Road here. Inside, the glow continues from polychromatic patch-worked canopies lining the ceiling to ruby glass, which screens the candle atop every table. All of this brilliance is an appropriate backdrop for India's cuisine -- equally splendid in its varied flavors.</p>
        <p>That the menu and the kitchen's skill have remained steady over the years has both advantages and disadvantages. Dependability can be a virtue. Repeat diners at India House know exactly what to expect. No surprises here.

        <p>STONE lions flank the heavy wooden entrance door to India House, for more than 16 years a welcome bit of brightness on a dreary stretch of the Albany Post Road here. Inside, the glow continues from polychromatic patch-worked canopies lining the ceiling to ruby glass, which screens the candle atop every table. All of this brilliance is an appropriate backdrop for India's cuisine -- equally splendid in its varied flavors.</p>
        <p>That the menu and the kitchen's skill have remained steady over the years has both advantages and disadvantages. Dependability can be a virtue. Repeat diners at India House know exactly what to expect. No surprises here. On the other hand, we would have appreciated a few -- perhaps some of India's superb dumplings or a piece of spicy pan-seared fish -- just enough novelty to tease the palate and to educate the diner on the enormous breadth of India's cuisine.</p>
        <p>But dependability could not be faulted when it came to starters. In addition to traditional mulligatawny soup, made with yellow lentils, other savory openers were on hand, as always. Try an assortment since almost every component is delicious: meat or vegetable samosa wrapped in tender flaky pastry; pakora, those moist vegetable fritters with the color of cinnabar and the scent of coriander, and, so often dry elsewhere but here supple and succulent, seekh kebab of herbed ground lamb.</p>
        <p>Except for a couple of undistinguished shredded crab dishes, the category called Jewels of the Sea meant shrimp,; they were slightly overcooked tandoori style, but otherwise arrived juicy, big and crisp.</p>
        <p>Deep yellow from mustard seeds, appetizer shrimp (ka khaja) came  smothered with sweet fragrant onions. Lemon shrimp, a special, were well matched with a creamy citrus sauce. Nor can one go wrong choosing them do piaz (with two preparations of onions), saag (with spinach puree) or curried.</p>
        <p>The tandoor also produced chicken a tad dryer than we like. The cooked chicken, however, took on moisture when ground or diced and treated to a sauce, like that for opulent chicken Kashmiri, a delectable mingling of dates, apricots, pineapple, other dried fruit and ground nuts. Minced chicken masala with yogurt gravy hinting of ginger, chicken saag or chicken makhni (with creamed cashews) made other satisfying selections.</p>
        <p>Lamb can be a mite tough, but its flavor was fine. Nuggets of the meat took nicely to the creaminess of two regional specialties, both rich with crushed nuts -- badam pasanda and rogan josh. A pan called a kadai cooked lamb almost entirely in its own juice, a good choice for diners looking for something tasty but plain, and spicy ground lamb (keema mater) in gravy was a particular delight.</p>
        <p>The menu lists more than a dozen vegetable dishes. After the richness of sauced meats, simply prepared vegetables balanced a meal nicely.  Two dishes that have never disappointed were alu gobi (cauliflower and potato) and, here generous with cubes of particularly tasty Indian cottage cheese, paneer palak (with pureed spinach).</p>
        <p>Simple breads were best for setting off sauced dishes. Nan had excellent elasticity. Yet the popular golden balloon called poori was a bit too oily to our taste. Skip mushy biryani for plain basmati rice, which comes with the entrees. Raita, a cooling yogurt and cucumber sauce, made a good extinguisher for dishes diners might find too fiery for comfort.</p>
        <p>For dessert, coconut or mango ice cream made a refreshing and sweet ending. With rose water overtones, Indian rice pudding was also a treat.</p>
        <p>The price range is broad, and many diners share selections. A three-course dinner averages $24 without drinks, tax and tip.</p>
        <p>India House  199 Albany Post Road  (Route 9A), Montrose. 736-0005.</p>
