        <p>In the beginning there were Dummies books for computer users, and they were fruitful and multiplied. Soon the publisher, IDG Books Worldwide, found that Dummies needed help with practically everything from investing to beer. Now there is ''Making Marriage Work for Dummies'' by a Tenafly couple, Dr. Steven Simring, an associate professor and vice chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at New Jersey Medical School and Dr. Sue Klavans Simring, a social worker. The book, written with Gene Busnar, is a fix-it manual for marital error messages. Troubleshooting tip: Don't automatically blame your spouse for the problem. Thinking about a second child? Warning! ''One child is relatively portable and you can still travel and do many of the things you did when you were childless.'' Romance? Tip! ''Do All the Corny Things.'' The Simrings, who have been married for 30 years and have three children, say they have found lots of corny things in Bergen County that keep love alive, like taking walks along the Palisades or dining out in a Japanese or Middle Eastern restaurant. ''You don't have to traipse into the city for that,'' said Dr. Simring.</p>
