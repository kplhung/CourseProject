        <p>MIDAFTERNOON on Friday, May 26, was brilliant and sunny at La Guardia Airport. Passengers were moving briskly in anticipation of a holiday weekend. But a cloud was visible on the electronic horizon: the schedule boards showed that United had canceled Flight 1719, due to depart at 7:30 p.m. for Dulles Airport near Washington.</p>
        <p>By 4 p.m., the airline had posted ''delayed'' next to the listing for the preceding trip to Dulles, the 6:30 p.m. United Express Flight 7685. ''Flow control into La Guardia due to wind,'' Yvette Lazu, a United ticket agent, told this reporter.</p>
        <p>As hours passed, tangles compounded. The equipment for the 6:30 flight was changed, with a drop in passenger capacity to 29 from 50. Standby Dulles passengers were told there would be nothing for them until Saturday morning. A queue of angry, quarrelsome, occasionally weeping passengers began to struggle for ways to get out before the holiday evaporated.</p>
        <p>Mistrust Among Passengers</p>
        <p>''How can it be weather?'' a woman in line said. ''Look at that beautiful day!'' She waved at the lowering sun, so blinding that passengers shunned seats facing the windows. Others nodded, distrusting the agent, even though weather was in fact to blame for the cancellation.</p>
        <p>Down in the windowless Port Authority offices at La Guardia, where the tower's instructions crackle on the radio, Anthony D. Layne and Larry McAleer, the managers on duty, made telephone calls and reported that Federal Aviation Administration controllers in Westbury, N.Y., faced with strong winds to the west, were spacing arrivals and departures more widely, bringing delays of 30 to 45 minutes across the board, a situation that continued until almost 9 p.m. Bad weather elsewhere brought other cancellations among La Guardia's 1,100 regular daily arrivals or departures on seven scheduled airlines on May 26, a day the airport was handling 19 percent more passengers than on a regular Friday.</p>
        <p>The classic flight-cancellation mis en scene at La Guardia, and some incidents observed by reporters the same afternoon at Atlanta Hartsfield and O'Hare in Chicago, were clear examples of passengers' suspicions of airline motives and airline employees' reluctance to speak of unwelcome realities. The observations also indicate some ways passengers can reduce the difficulties caused by cancellations. They're worth knowing about, because the trend of cancellations is upward.</p>
        <p>Airlines do not guarantee their schedules. They try to adhere to published schedules because it is less trouble than rebooking frustrated passengers. But weather, air traffic, mechanical difficulties, rules governing crew hours and hundreds of other causes, including human error, can upset schedules. The government exercises only a few regulations over passenger service -- penalties for overbooking notable among them -- and there are no federal requirements on how passengers on canceled flights are to be treated.</p>
        <p>The percentage of flights canceled is not high: from May 1, 1999, to April 30, 2000, cancellations by the 10 major airlines at 29 big United States airports ranged from 1.8 percent (November) to 5.7 percent (January, a percentage spike in a bad weather period). But as flight totals increase, the percentages represent bigger numbers. Last month 8,590 flights were canceled out of 307,116 scheduled. A year ago it was 6,487 out of 299,132.</p>
        <p>When they cancel, the airlines say, they prefer to inconvenience as few passengers as possible. A big plane intended for a lightly booked flight may be transferred to replace a sidelined plane that was to have carried a heavy load, and the lightly booked flight is then canceled. This is not the easiest thing to do, airline officials say, because the scheduled crew cannot always handle the new equipment. But elimination of an undersold flight may be one reason travelers believe cancellations are profit-driven, and airlines can contribute to this perception. In Chicago on May 26, when Trans World Airlines canceled Flight 207, due to leave O'Hare at 5:44 p.m. for St. Louis, the attendant at the gate told a reporter that it had been canceled because it was underbooked. A spokeswoman for T.W.A. in St. Louis, Julia Bishop-Cross, said later that the flight had actually been full, that weather had caused the cancellation, and that all the passengers were rebooked later that evening.</p>
        <p>With traffic growing heavier, the airlines have adopted another strategy: cancel rather than let delays backlog. If possible, they cancel early, notify passengers at home and rebook them for the next day rather than deal with ''rolling delays'' that may create long waits at the airport.</p>
        <p>May 18, during the week before the Memorial Day holiday, was an evening of major thunderstorms in New York, and incoming flights were diverted and delayed, and outbound flights canceled wholesale. A number of Port Authority officials said that cancellations enabled the lines to rebook their passengers to Friday flights and get the situation back to normal quickly.</p>
        <p>Jerry Spampanato, deputy general manager of Kennedy Airport, was on duty, and he said the airlines' national headquarters, looking at a Thursday night of foul weather, elected damage control. ''As bad as it was on Thursday, the fastest way was to cancel flights and recoup on Friday,'' he said. ''You have to position your aircraft. It's a corporate decision the lines make looking at everything from their headquarters. With a tie-up in New York, it affects the globe.''</p>
        <p>To wit: on June 15 bad weather produced three-  to six-hour delays and 200 cancellations at La Guardia.</p>
        <p>Considering the Alternatives</p>
        <p>On the holiday weekend, United's difficulties with its short flights to Dulles on Friday considerably upset Tony Horan, a New York lawyer, and his wife, Susan Trotter. The couple bought a country place in Virginia in January, and after a try with US Airways, which Ms. Trotter said did not seem reliable enough, she booked United tickets to Dulles for every other weekend through the summer, paying $129 a person for each round trip. They keep a car parked at Dulles, in Chantilly, Va. The previous weekend they got in about 1 a.m., because of a United cancellation. This time they had everything necessary to board the 6:30 flight, but when it was shifted to a 29-passenger Jetstream, because Ms. Trotter refuses to fly on smaller planes, they looked for alternatives. ''You stand in line for a long time,'' she said, ''and you find that someone with more mileage gets the seats.''</p>
        <p>The couple left the line of passengers trying to get rebooking, and sat with a cell phone in the gate area. The 7:30 p.m. had long been a dead issue, and they were looking for something out of Newark. Because their car was at Dulles, a flight to Reagan Airport would not serve. Finally they arranged a one-way car rental from La Guardia to Dulles.</p>
        <p>''We are rethinking July 4,'' Mr. Horan said. On the drive to Dulles they called United and asked for a refund of the tickets they did not use. Eventually, the line gave it to them.</p>
        <p>Linda Price of Charleston, W.Va., who works for AT&amp;T, was on her way home after running a training session for her employer in New York. She finished early and arrived at the airport at 3 p.m. for the 6:30 p.m. flight to Dulles, where she was to connect to a flight to Charleston. As the delays mounted, she asked the gate agent if she was going to make the second flight, and he told her not to worry. When the flight finally took off at 8:34 p.m., she was on board. But, said Gary Lonieski, United's manager of special services at La Guardia, the flight did not arrive until 9:59, and Ms. Price's connecting flight, 7603, had taken off at 9:50.</p>
        <p>Mr. Layne of the Port Authority said that the sort of cascading delays created by the winds in the west reported by the F.A.A.'s New York Terminal Radar Control Facility in Westbury put airline employees in a wringer. ''They are exceedingly slow to acknowledge there are delays,'' Mr. Layne said. ''They push back from the gate on time, but they know they will be held up getting out.'' That night, takeoff delays reached an hour to an hour and a half before the winds died at 8:50 p.m.</p>
        <p>At about that time, the two United agents dealing with the problems of those with tickets for the delayed, downsized flight finally cleared the line-up. One passenger had taken 20 minutes, during which she shouted at the agents: ''Who is going to pay for the $500 hotel room I will not be occupying?'' After the flight left, when the agent was asked what arrangements had been made for that passenger, he said he did not remember. ''Not a great day,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, passengers on the canceled 7:30 flight were directed to Gate 12C, where a United agent, Wally Cruz, was stationed to rebook them. No one showed up. Mr. Cruz was asked if the flight was empty, and he said no, 96 of the 112 seats had been booked, but probably the passengers had learned earlier and taken other steps. Some were probably rebooked on the 11:30 a.m. Saturday flight, he said, because the 9:30 a.m. had also been canceled. This was a result of a crew shortage, said Ms. Lazu, the ticket agent.</p>
        <p>Although the airlines do not phrase it that way, a good expedient for travelers is to resume the old habit of reconfirming. Nine out of 10 of the major domestic airlines have telephone numbers for automated systems on which flight numbers can be punched in and status information obtained; the same information is available on the lines' Web sites. The 10th airline, Southwest, has a phone that is answered by employees.</p>
        <p>With cancellations increasing, travelers with immutable deadlines -- weddings, graduations, speeches -- should probably consider building an extra day into their schedules. People who use travel agents can obtain telephone numbers that are staffed 24 hours, so rebookings can be made more easily than by standing in line.</p>
        <p>A day of watching the arrival and departure boards makes one thing apparent: if there are incoming delays, there will be outbound delays. When American Airlines Flight 354 inbound from Chicago and Las Vegas was canceled on Friday evening, it was not hard to see why Flight 303 scheduled to go to Chicago and San Francisco at 6:30 a.m. Saturday was already canceled. It is doubly worth checking the counter if such a possibility exists.</p>
        <p>And looming cancellations are yet another reason to travel light: those who carry everything with them are in a better position to take a flight to an alternative airport.</p>
