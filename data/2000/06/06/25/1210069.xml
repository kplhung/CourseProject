        <p>GEORGE TURNER, a real estate agent and entrepreneur, began to despise Con Edison more than two decades ago. For 21 years, he sent the company monthly checks for electricity and gas service for one simple reason: there was no alternative.</p>
        <p>But in June 1999, Mr. Turner received what he considers a blessing in the mail: a letter from Con Edison with a long list of utility companies he could sign up with. State deregulation was forcing the company to open the door to competitors.</p>
        <p>''To tell you the truth, I was just very fed up with Con Edison,'' Mr. Turner, 64, said.  ''They have a very strange attitude when you call about something. Anytime I have a chance to deal with someone other than Con Edison, I will take that opportunity, even if it is a slim amount I'll save.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner has signed up with SmartEnergy.com, and while he is only saving a couple of dollars a month, he is pleased. It is refreshing, he said, to hear the voice of someone who was eager to have his business. ''Plus, it is a dot-com company, and I am on the computer all day,'' he said, ''so it is easy to deal with.''</p>
        <p>Some other companies are Central Hudson Enterprises Corporation of Poughkeepsie; Econnergy Energy Company of Pomona, N.J.; and Robinson Enery of Elmsford.</p>
        <p>Thousands of residents have signed up with new providers in recent months, according to the State Public Service Commission. And many more may do so as a result of state action last month lifting price controls and allowing utilities to base prices on market conditions. That means that over the summer, when demand is high, Con Edison can raise rates, if it chooses.</p>
        <p>SmartEnergy of Woburn, Mass., is offering a yearly fixed-rate plan, which would not be subject to month-to-month rate fluctuations. Company officials would not release the number of Westchester residents who had signed up, but they said that 20 percent of their New York State customers are in the county.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people don't really understand what they are getting into this summer,'' said Gautam Chandra, the president and chief executive of SmartEnergy.</p>
        <p>''Utility rates will fluctuate this summer, and a lot of people could be paying a lot more with their host utility. ''This is the time to look at other options.''</p>
        <p>For their part, Con Edison officials said they have introduced a new online service to search for the best prices to help customers avoid rate spikes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chandra's company has begun a multimillion-dollar marketing campaign directed at Westchester customers.</p>
        <p>The change was one step in a three-year drive to eliminate many of the monopoly-era pricing regulations governing the state's electricity industry and to help Con Edison ease into a more competitive market, said David C. Flanagan, a spokesman for the Public Service Commission.</p>
        <p>The SmartEnergy.com campaign, which included billboards and radio spots, began on April 1. On a number of levels, the push comes at a difficult time for Con Edison. The company is still suffering from last year's public relations setbacks after blackouts in Westchester and New York City. And last month county officials filed a lawsuit to prevent the company from passing on to consumers the costs of a radioactive leak at the Indian Point 2 nuclear plant.</p>
        <p>Since April, consumers have been charged an additional $2 a month on average to cover the $600,000 a day that Con Edison says it is spending to buy replacement power from other utilities because of the shutdown of the plant.</p>
        <p>SmartEnergy is among several online electricity providers that have slowly been expanding across the country. Customers can sign up for service by logging onto its Web site at www.smartenergy.com and then entering their ZIP code to see what is offered in their area.</p>
        <p>Although the Con Edison network is still used to deliver power, deregulation has forced the company to let smaller providers sell electricity to Con Edison's customers -- possibly at a lower rate.</p>
        <p>Jon F. Sorenson, the chief marketing officer of SmartEnergy, said the company was also offering a combined fixed-rate plan for natural gas. He added that customers receive one bill for both services and a bonus of $25 and 1,000 airline miles for signing up. The air miles plan continues, with customers receiving one mile for each $1 they spend. The fixed rate plan costs about 6.59 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity in Westchester, about a penny and a half less than the company's similar plan in Manhattan, Mr. Sorenson said.</p>
        <p>''It still was not much of a saving,'' Mr. Turner noted. ''But I just said, 'Thank God it is not Con Edison.' ''</p>
