        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>With home schooling (''Home Schooling Graduates,'' cover, May 21) there are but a few success stories. These are promoted and glorified, leaving a lopsided view.</p>
        <p>Last year, in my attempt to do research on the subject, I made more than three dozen calls over eight weeks to educators and officials. No calls were ever returned. Persistence, however, provided the following information from state agencies, as well as the Legal Division for the Department of Education in Utah, where the Mormon Church was probably one of the first organized religions to promote home schooling:</p>
        <p>*State and national statistics are unavailable.</p>
        <p>*Parents are not tested to determine their ability to teach.</p>
        <p>*Parents providing home schooling may not have a high school education.</p>
        <p>*There are no uniform standards, guidelines, and protocol.</p>
        <p>*Children are not routinely tested.</p>
        <p>*Families have been known to use home schooling as an excuse to remain on welfare. Welfare families may receive supplements for their rent and utilities.</p>
        <p>*Home schooling has enabled physical and sexual abuse to remain unreported. Children may be housed five or six consecutive days a week without exposure to outdoor sunlight, physical and social activities.</p>
        <p>Brothers, aged 6 and 10, received a half-hour of religious instruction and 45 minutes of supervised schooling in their mother's bed a few days a week. The rest of the time they spent playing games, watching television, and playing on the computer.</p>
        <p>Some parents want the best for their children and are able to provide an excellent, consistent, balanced educational program at home while others do not. Home schooling has created an unbalanced, unhealthy, unchecked educational situation for far too many of our children.</p>
        <p>America's children, employers and taxpayers deserve better because, in the end, it is the taxpayer who will incur the financial burden created by the mounting challenges of educational delinquency, some of it promoted by religion, all of it ignored by government. Above our concerns about the environment, the ''right to life'' and numerous other causes should be the rights of innocent children in our own backyard, and our failure to demand an educational system with built in checks and balances covering all children.</p>
