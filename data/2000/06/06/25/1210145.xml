        <p>The Y-100 Feztival, at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Blockbuster Sony Entertainment Center in Camden, is as alternative as a radio-friendly music concert can get this summer. From the Stone Temple Pilots who serve up a grinding mix of coherent hard rock to the energetic ska-punk of Gwen Stefani's No Doubt, much of what the current modern rock format represents is showcased here.</p>
        <p>The semi-charmed rock life of Third Eye Blind is propelled by pop punk that is more fresh and frenetic live than on their recordings. Stroke 9 are still enjoying the success of their sardonic guitar-pop mini-hit ''Little Black Backpack,'' from last year's ''Nasty Little Thoughts.'' Eve 6 plays its garage-styled brat-rock with intense glee and catchy refrains.</p>

        <p>The semi-charmed rock life of Third Eye Blind is propelled by pop punk that is more fresh and frenetic live than on their recordings. Stroke 9 are still enjoying the success of their sardonic guitar-pop mini-hit ''Little Black Backpack,'' from last year's ''Nasty Little Thoughts.'' Eve 6 plays its garage-styled brat-rock with intense glee and catchy refrains.</p>
        <p>The photogenic Lit also has an infectious hard-pop sound that was what made songs like the rousing ''Zip-Lock'' so successful (O.K., their ''Miserable'' video featuring Pamela Anderson Lee didn't hurt their career either).</p>
        <p>For all-out creativity, the Violent Femmes are the prize. With roots imbedded in blues and folk, this eccentric band has influenced alternative rock for more than a decade. They are as current and unusual as ever.</p>
