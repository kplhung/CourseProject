      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The New York Seaway Trail is a 454-mile scenic alternative to modern highways along Lake Erie, the Niagara River, Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River. To introduce visitors to the abundant cultural, historical and recreational resources along the trail, the Seaway Trail Foundation will open the Seaway Trail Discovery Center on July 15 in Sackets Harbor, just west of Watertown on Lake Ontario.</p>
        <p>The center, a three-story Federal building built in 1817 as the Union Hotel, has nine rooms with interactive exhibits on the history, architecture and natural resources of 10 counties of New York -- St. Lawrence, Jefferson, Oswego, Cayuga, Wayne, Monroe, Orleans, Niagara, Erie and Chautauqua. Exhibits focus on the 27 historic lighthouses along the route; on local battles in the War of 1812; woodlands, wetlands and beaches; famous residents, among them Susan B. Anthony, Frederic Remington and George Eastman; and agriculture. An exhibit features Federal and Victorian houses and the work of Frank Lloyd Wright and Frederick Law Olmsted, among others.</p>
