        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Andrew Johnston's article on Jean Vigo and ''L'Atalante'' [''Rescuing a Romantic Epic from Obscurity,'' June 11] is a welcome and sincere attempt to bring to the attention of film lovers an unjustly neglected master and his greatest masterpiece. But by presenting Vigo as a creator of ''romantic fluff'' and his father, the radical Miguel Almereyda, as a merely exotic figure, Mr. Johnston has obscured the vital psychological connection between father and son that crucially shaped the latter's work.</p>
        <p>More than in his unsuccessful attempt to clear his father's reputation (alluded to by Mr. Johnston), Vigo, through his chosen art form, struggled to carry on Almereyda's ideals. Though his films may strike today's critics as more charming than revolutionary, all of them reflect Vigo's deepest social convictions and concerns. In his very first work, the brilliant short ''A Propos de Nice,'' that seaside playground of the rich is depicted as a kingdom of death and its wealthy denizens as grotesques straight out of a Brueghelian hell. With the lovely ''Zero de Conduite,'' the artist discovers the revolutionary impulse not in the ''class struggle'' but in the innate and unconquerable hunger, within every soul, for absolute freedom -- symbolized by a schoolboys' revolt in a French boarding school.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Andrew Johnston's article on Jean Vigo and ''L'Atalante'' [''Rescuing a Romantic Epic from Obscurity,'' June 11] is a welcome and sincere attempt to bring to the attention of film lovers an unjustly neglected master and his greatest masterpiece. But by presenting Vigo as a creator of ''romantic fluff'' and his father, the radical Miguel Almereyda, as a merely exotic figure, Mr. Johnston has obscured the vital psychological connection between father and son that crucially shaped the latter's work.</p>
        <p>More than in his unsuccessful attempt to clear his father's reputation (alluded to by Mr. Johnston), Vigo, through his chosen art form, struggled to carry on Almereyda's ideals. Though his films may strike today's critics as more charming than revolutionary, all of them reflect Vigo's deepest social convictions and concerns. In his very first work, the brilliant short ''A Propos de Nice,'' that seaside playground of the rich is depicted as a kingdom of death and its wealthy denizens as grotesques straight out of a Brueghelian hell. With the lovely ''Zero de Conduite,'' the artist discovers the revolutionary impulse not in the ''class struggle'' but in the innate and unconquerable hunger, within every soul, for absolute freedom -- symbolized by a schoolboys' revolt in a French boarding school.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnston is also correct in asserting that Vigo's last and greatest film, ''L'Atalante,'' was essentially a commercial assignment, but it would be wrong to conclude from this that the movie lacks social content. The director of the shipping line for which the movie's hero works represents precisely the sort of cruel, Philistine businessman-tyrant that Vigo most deeply loathed. When the heroine, Juliette, finds herself stranded and jobless in Depression-era Paris, she sees street prostitutes and long lines of unemployed workers everywhere. A poverty-stricken youth snatches Juliette's purse, inciting a furious middle-class mob to a brutal attack upon the hapless thief. (This scene may be an allusion to one of Almereyda's earliest public revolutionary acts: defending from the crowd's wrath a child who had stolen some firewood.) All these details demonstrate that Vigo was confronting, not running away from, the grim realities of his times.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most startling feature of the work, however -- one that cannot be reconciled with Mr. Johnston's description of the movie as romantic fluff -- is its treatment of sexuality. The main characters, particularly Juliette, are depicted as frankly and openly sensual in a manner that would not become commonplace in cinema until the rise of the French New Wave, a quarter of a century later. (Both Vigo's parents, who never married, were sexual as well as political rebels and openly enjoyed relations with other partners.) The poignancy of the scenes in which Jean and Juliette are temporarily separated arises from the almost palpable sense of erotic longing that Vigo, through his use of delicate, dreamlike imagery and subtle transitions, marvelously evokes.</p>
