        <p>Bob May has been here before. That's exactly why he is not ready to get excited over the chance to win his first PGA Tour title.</p>
        <p>May shot a two-under-par 69 in windy conditions yesterday to take a one-stroke lead over Steve Pate and Notah Begay III after the third round of the St. Jude Classic in Memphis.</p>
        <p>But the memory of blowing a third-round lead last October in 40-mile-an-hour winds in the Las Vegas Invitational remains fresh in his mind.</p>
        <p>At a T.P.C. at Southwind course where 61 is the record, May said anyone could win the $540,000 check with a good round today.</p>
        <p>''The golf course is in perfect shape, and we've got perfect greens,'' he said. ''If someone gets a hot putter, I wouldn't be surprised if someone went out and shot a 64 or 63.''</p>
        <p>May, who went through qualifying last year after spending three seasons on the European tour, has as good a chance as anyone to win a tournament that the top money winners have avoided this week.</p>
        <p>He has strung together three straight rounds in the 60's for the first time this year. He had six birdies and four bogeys yesterday for a 12-under 201 total after opening with consecutive 66's.</p>
