        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Some years after the events dramatized in ''The Countess'' [''A Twisted Victorian Love Story That Won't Die Out'' by Lucinda Franks, May 28], William Ewart Gladstone, the prime minister, said to his daughter, ''Should you ever hear anyone blame Millais, or his wife, or Mr. Ruskin, remember there was no fault: there was misfortune, even tragedy: all three were perfectly blameless.'' That view may not be the last word -- it may not even reflect the whole truth -- but I prefer it to both the playwright's statement that Ruskin ''set about trying to destroy'' his wife (an appalling charge to level at anyone; unconscionable to level it at an emotional retard like Ruskin) and the Ruskin apologists' assertion that the play ''was unfair to 'diminish' the reputation'' of their hero. (His reputation as what? He has no reputation as a husband; and how is his reputation as a thinker and prophet diminished by the shortcomings of his personal life?)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Some years after the events dramatized in ''The Countess'' [''A Twisted Victorian Love Story That Won't Die Out'' by Lucinda Franks, May 28], William Ewart Gladstone, the prime minister, said to his daughter, ''Should you ever hear anyone blame Millais, or his wife, or Mr. Ruskin, remember there was no fault: there was misfortune, even tragedy: all three were perfectly blameless.'' That view may not be the last word -- it may not even reflect the whole truth -- but I prefer it to both the playwright's statement that Ruskin ''set about trying to destroy'' his wife (an appalling charge to level at anyone; unconscionable to level it at an emotional retard like Ruskin) and the Ruskin apologists' assertion that the play ''was unfair to 'diminish' the reputation'' of their hero. (His reputation as what? He has no reputation as a husband; and how is his reputation as a thinker and prophet diminished by the shortcomings of his personal life?)</p>
        <p>In connection with the annulment of his marriage to Effie Gray, Ruskin wrote in 1854: ''I married her thinking her young and affectionate that I might influence her as I chose, and make of her just such a wife as I wanted. It appeared that she married me thinking she could make of me just the husband she wanted. I was grieved and disappointed at finding that I could not change her; and she was humiliated and irritated at finding that she could not change me.'' Wretchedly sad words. And even as a Ruskin proselytizer, I am struck by the disturbingly self-serving contrast between ''I was grieved and disappointed'' and ''she was humiliated and irritated.''</p>
        <p>In much the same way I was disturbed, sometimes even repelled, by many of the lines Gregory Murphy, the playwright, gives Ruskin in ''The Countess.'' In fact, for me, watching the play was an excruciatingly painful experience -- but mainly because it rang so true. What the play does not (cannot?) do, though, is show us that the principal reason Effie was John's victim was that John himself was a much more thoroughly abused victim -- of his one-of-a-kind upbringing by two loving, tough, generous, selfish, indulgent, demanding,  all-too-imperfect parents.</p>
        <p>Gladstone may not have been perfectly right with ''perfectly blameless,'' but the more one knows about the gap between John Ruskin's genius and his understanding of how ordinary mortals actually lived their lives, the clearer it becomes that ''tragedy'' is by no means too grand a word to apply to the disjunction at the center of his being.</p>
        <p>I very much hope that a film will be made about Ruskin, and that it will be made by people who themselves have a touch of genius, in the hope that in addition to relating the story of a ghastly, punishing nightmare inflicted upon an extraordinary woman, it will also convey -- much better than ''The Countess'' can -- something close to the complex truth about her husband's beautiful and terrible life.</p>
