        <p>SOME of us in the social commentary business have spent the better part of their 40's mocking a certain type of person out here in suburbia.

        <p>For lack of a better term, we might have called them Yuppies, or post-Yuppies. Sometimes we called them Boomers, and sometimes we just described the era -- throwing in knowing references to ''fin de siecle'' America, as if it was going out of style.</p>

        <p>SOME of us in the social commentary business have spent the better part of their 40's mocking a certain type of person out here in suburbia. You know who I'm talking about, of course: the kind who pays extra for distressed jeans with holes in them, gives their children Rolodexes for Christmas and actually understands the menu at Starbucks.</p>
        <p>For lack of a better term, we might have called them Yuppies, or post-Yuppies. Sometimes we called them Boomers, and sometimes we just described the era -- throwing in knowing references to ''fin de siecle'' America, as if it was going out of style.</p>
        <p>Then came the decade nobody knew quite how to describe. We were all getting a little desperate when the journalist David Brooks came along with the book, ''Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, $25).  Bobos, in case you haven't heard, are not clowns in the Big Apple Circus. They are Bourgeois Bohemians, members of the overeducated class that, as a friend of ours in academia says, like to ''think left and live right.''</p>
        <p>They are the indulged and indulgent, coffee (or decaf latte)-swigging achievers with a Palm Pilot in one hand and a cell phone in the hand. And, yes, David Brooks confirmed to us on the phone the other day, New Jersey is a Bobo paradise -- what with all the little ''faux cities'' like Montclair, Ridgewood and Princeton, filled with 'people who don't want to admit they're suburbanites.''</p>
        <p>You know who you are. Just in case you don't, though, here is a quiz.</p>
        <p>1. I go to church or synagogue to:</p>
        <p>a. pray</p>
