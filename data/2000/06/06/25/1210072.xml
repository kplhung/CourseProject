        <p>NORM ZIMMER, a member the of Meriden Conservation Commission, calls the Metacomet Ridge ''a mini-wilderness in an urban setting.'' He said he estimates that a million Connecticut residents live in the towns through which the nearly continuous line of craggy, reddish cliffs stretch, from Branford along Long Island Sound to Suffield on the Massachusetts border, neatly dividing the state up the middle.</p>
        <p>These cliffs, made up of tough volcanic basalt rock, also known as traprock, say local historians, biologists and geologists, are unique features of the Connecticut landscape, something that cannot be found anywhere else in the world. They are an important part of Yankee history, Indian legend, and the natural history of the state.</p>
        <p>The line of ridges, and some parallel secondary formations, are nearly all undeveloped, even after 350 years of commercially minded Connecticut Yankees living astride them in the middle of the state's fertile Central Valley. This has made them natural routes for the state's blue-blazed hiking trail system.</p>
        <p>Skiers, mountain bikers, and rock climbers also use them, and their extraordinary views provide the settings for some of the state's most popular parks and picnic grounds. The Heublein Tower on Talcott Mountain offers probably the best scenic view in the state. The traprock's superior ground water filtering qualities make them invaluable to the state's public water supply. The hard, brittle traprock, very dense but easily crushed, has been a valuable material for building roadbeds since the early 1800's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zimmer, a Meriden firefighter, grew up playing along the stark cliffs of the Hanging Hills in that city. For the past decade, he has been an environmentalist who has worked to protect the Hanging Hills from development and start a multi-regional effort to preserve the whole ridgeline from Massachusetts to Long Island Sound.</p>
        <p>''There's quite a movement to preserve these mountains,'' he said. ''This has been my cause for 10 years.''</p>
        <p>Among the movement's accomplishments is the passage by the State Legislature in 1996 of the Ridgeline Protection Act, which authorizes local governments to enact special zoning and conservation regulations to limit residential and commercial use of specifically designated traprock ridges, including the Metacomet Ridge.</p>
        <p>At the state capitol on Earth Day in 1998, 17 towns signed the Metacomet Ridge Conservation Compact, a statement of intent to preserve the main traprock ridge line.</p>
        <p>The traprock ridges are a unique geological feature, said Greg McHone, a geologist at Wesleyan University. There are some smaller traprock formations in other states, such as the Palisades along the Hudson River, but none of the size of Connecticut's, he said.</p>
        <p>Ralph Lewis, the state geologist, said they were formed in what appears to be the largest series of volcanic eruptions of the last half billion years, an event of great violence that also created the Atlantic Ocean. Mr. McHone said the eruptions might also have been responsible for one of the Earth's five great extinction events, in which vast numbers of plant and animal species died during a volcanic winter lasting thousands of years.</p>
        <p>''Starting about 500 million years ago, Africa and North America crashed together, and that continental fender bender is what raised the Appalachian Mountains,'' Mr. Lewis said. The collision involved all of the other continents as well, and formed a supercontinent scientists call Pangaea. During the age of the dinosaurs, about 200 million years ago, the supercontinent began to break apart as the continental plates that comprised it moved away from each other to form the Atlantic Ocean. The movement tore eastern and western Connecticut apart, creating the central valley and opening up huge cracks extending all the way through the Earth's crust to the molten rock beneath. Molten lava flowed out of the cracks, but instead of forming volcanoes, the lava spread out across the land.</p>
        <p>After the lava cooled, the basalt layer cracked into faults and tilted downward toward the east. The tilting caused the higher, western ends to sheer off and thrust upward along the fault lines. ''This gives you those west-facing scarps,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''If you look at them you see that they're asymmetrical.''</p>
        <p>''They broke into pieces and tilted up,'' said Mr. McHone. ''It's hard to imagine the Earth doing that.''</p>
        <p>Over the ages, the basalt was covered with sediment that hardened into arkose, the brownstone that was a favorite building material for multi-story buildings in the late-1800's. During the Ice Age, 26,000 to 15,000 years ago, a huge glacier more than a mile thick pushed across Connecticut, tearing all of the weaker brownstone away, and leaving the tougher traprock basalt exposed when the ice receded.</p>
        <p>Traprock is named from the Swedish word trappa, which means steps, because of the characteristic shape of the stones. Basalt has a high iron content, and when it was exposed to the weather it rusted, turning traprock its distinctive orange. A pile of fallen blocks of stone, or talus, is invariably found at the foot of the cliffs.</p>
        <p>The Metacomet Ridge starts with the Saltonstall Ridge in Branford and runs north to Middletown. There it zags west across Meriden, then continues north through New Britain to Suffield, finally ending near Northampton, Mass. Travelers on Interstates 91 and 84 know it because those highways pass over it in Middletown and Plainville.</p>
        <p>Early European immigrants to Connecticut called the Metacomet Ridge ''The Great Wall,'' because it formed a nearly impassable barrier dividing the valley. Originally, Connecticut was two colonies, Hartford and New Haven, separated by the Metacomet Ridge. King Charles II punished New Haven in the 1660's by revoking its colonial charter after three Puritan judges who had condemned his father, Charles I, to death were hidden in a cave on West Rock, a traprock formation overlooking the city.</p>
        <p>Since World War II, the Wilbur Cross Highway and Interstates 91 and 84 have been blasted through the Great Wall, but it still forces travelers to follow roundabout routes. ''It makes travel difficult because they don't put the highways over the rocks. They build them around them,'' said Amy Hinson, a Southbury resident out for a hike on Mount Higby, part of the Metacomet Ridge that overlooks I-91 in Middletown.</p>
        <p>Southbury is tucked between the Metacomet Ridge to the east and the ridge that forms the western edge of the Central Valley, and Ms. Hinson said anytime she wants to drive anywhere it seems she has to go several miles north or south first.</p>
        <p>The ridge was named after Metacomet, who led Massachusetts and Connecticut Indian tribes in a war against the white colonists in the 1670's, but that's not where the Indian connection ends.</p>
        <p>The Sleeping Giant, a massive traprock dome formed from the same lava, but with an east-west orientation, looks remarkably like someone reclining. According to a Quinnipiac Indian legend, the mountain is a great spirit named Hobbamock who was bewitched after diverting the Connecticut River out of Quinnipiac territory.</p>
        <p>Sleeping Giant became Connecticut's first state park following a fight between outraged citizens and a quarry operator who was busy tearing the giant down for building materials. While quarrying traprock still goes on today, it is the encroachment of residences on the ridges that is seen as the biggest threat to the many rare species of plants, insects, amphibians and reptiles found on the ridge tops, and to hikers' access to the Metacomet and Mattabeset trails.</p>
        <p>The cliffs along the ridges provide the best rock climbing in the state, said David Fasulo, president of the Ragged Mountain Foundation. Ragged Mountain, the northernmost portion of the Hanging Hills, draws scores of climbers every weekend during the warmer months and has been considered one of the best climbing cliffs in the country since the sport became popular in the 1920's, he said. Foundation members purchased the land where the 100-foot climbing cliff is located to preserve their access to it.</p>
        <p>Lauren Brown, a botanist, said she finds greater concentrations and abundance of rare wildflowers on the Metacomet Ridge than anywhere else in Connecticut. She particularly likes East Rock in New Haven.</p>
        <p>''It's a wilderness in the middle of a city,'' she said.</p>
