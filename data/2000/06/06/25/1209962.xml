        <p>MANY of the great yoga masters of India spent decades sitting tightly crosslegged in minuscule caves, sustained only by an occasional meager meal slipped into the recesses of their cells.

        <p>Usually, the passenger to my front has reclined his seat, forcing me to follow suit to keep my nose from being broken by his head cushion. The ''recline'' position is murder on the lower back, so I shove a pillow between the seat and the base of my spine.</p>

        <p>MANY of the great yoga masters of India spent decades sitting tightly crosslegged in minuscule caves, sustained only by an occasional meager meal slipped into the recesses of their cells. I draw inspiration from these yogis as I sit, hour after hour, strapped into the modern-day equivalent of a bed of nails: the economy class seat.</p>
        <p>Usually, the passenger to my front has reclined his seat, forcing me to follow suit to keep my nose from being broken by his head cushion. The ''recline'' position is murder on the lower back, so I shove a pillow between the seat and the base of my spine.</p>
        <p>Then there's the dilemma of knees. They bump against the seat pocket (filled to bursting with a thick stack of airline magazines, in-flight shopping catalogs, and entertainment guides for the movie that is being shown on a screen so small, and so far away, I wonder why they didn't pass out binoculars with the headsets). I can feel a wave of pins and needles coming on.</p>
        <p>So I slip out my legs, carefully, and extend them, tucking one under the seat in the four-inch space beside my carry-on. I extend the other, discreetly, alongside the aisle. It's a position that's better for blood circulation, but not so good if the beverage cart comes down the aisle while you're napping.</p>
        <p>In the last two years, I have flown economy class three times back and forth to Asia, eight times across the Atlantic, twice to California, Florida and the Caribbean, once to South America and once around the world. I've bought my tickets in a variety of ways, through travel agents, through airlines, on Internet sites and through air consolidator-brokers -- and I've found it possible, with a bit of effort, to secure a discounted fare (sometimes an amazingly discounted fare) for all my itineraries.</p>
        <p>Although my tickets have been cheap, my flights, in nearly every instance, have been reasonably on time. I've traveled with airlines ranging from Continental to Egypt Air to Lao Aviation, and not once have I been bumped, forced to wait hours in an airport, or been poisoned by the in-flight food. My baggage, which I usually check, rather than carry on (more on this later) has never failed to arrive at its destination when I did (although once, in Brazil, it arrived before  me). As far as the basics go, the airlines have delivered.</p>
        <p>Cheap, safe and efficient though my economy air travel has been, I cannot recall a time, since my first Allegheny Airlines flight, in 1964, when flying coach class has been less pleasant. I am not talking about frills, now largely jettisoned, like toothbrush kits, menu cards, hot towels and hot meals on every flight over two hours. To get cheaper fares, I'm glad to relinquish such little extras to the folks in business class.</p>
        <p>But the Faustian bargain that the economy-class traveler strikes with the airlines is not about frills, but basic human comforts. The discount fares come at the price of personal space, hygiene, breathable air and stress-free boarding and deplaning.</p>
        <p>To offer these low fares, most airlines have reconfigured coach class so tightly it makes me wonder whether they consulted behavioral specialists to determine the exact number of centimeters of elbow room human beings will tolerate before breaking out in fist fights with strangers. The air circulation in cabins is often turned down to the minimum level to save fuel -- increasing the possibility of respiratory distress, and transmission of colds and flu. Food,  never a strong point, has deteriorated, or shrunk to child-sized portions, or even, on shorter flights, disappeared altogether.</p>
        <p>And the same advances in computer technology that have allowed the airlines to offer more last-minute discounts to customers have also enabled them to maximize passenger loads. As recently as a year ago, I could count on being able to snag a seat next to an empty seat at least half of the time. But in the last nine months or so, the empty seats have vanished.</p>
        <p>As a result, flying economy class for longer than about three hours at a stretch has become a physical, even emotional, challenge. Because I'm flying economy class so often, I prepare for flying as diligently as I would a race or a rigorous hike. What follows are some of the strategies I've developed to improve my chances of survival in the bean-counting skies.</p>
        <p>PREPARING FOR FLYING</p>
        <p>I've always practiced yoga, but since I started to write the Frugal Traveler column, I've become a fanatic, attending classes three or four times a week when I'm home. There's no better way to cope with waiting in a crowded airline terminal, or shutting out the loud, unpleasant conversation of nearby travelers.</p>
        <p>Another way I try to build up my stamina for long trips is with a light program of aerobic exercise, especially the day before I fly. I drink lots of water the day before a flight, and take my personal regimen of B-vitamins and Indian ayurvedic and Chinese herbs to toughen my immune system for those stifling, germ-laden cabins.</p>
        <p>When I book my reservation, I also try to make my seat selection. It always feels like a bit of a crapshoot. Ideally, I want to get a seat next to an empty one, or one with a bit more legroom. I used to ask for window seats and bulkheads. But bulkheads nowadays are mainly given over to passengers with children, and window seats are claustrophobic when flights are completely full, which they are more often than not.</p>
        <p>And so I usually ask for an aisle seat, in the center rows, which offer a better chance of having an empty seat in the middle than do side rows, and allow me to get up and walk.</p>
        <p>WHAT TO TAKE</p>
        <p>I chuckle when I read in fashion magazines about the various travel kits preferred by supermodels who fly around the world. They're usually the size of a picnic basket and contain ''essential'' items like blusher that doubles as eye shadow, and five different kinds of moisturizer.</p>
        <p>My kit is the size of a pencil case, and contains two pairs of foam earplugs, toothbrush and paste, a nail clipper a sample-size vial of moisturizing eye drops from my doctor that help prevent red eye, and a pillbox with two Sudafed and two Advil tablets, and one five-milligram Valium. The Sudafeds are in case I'm forced to travel with a cold -- to prevent eardrums from painfully stretching on landing. The Advil is for headaches, and the Valium, broken in half, is what puts me to sleep on those 18-hour Asia flights.</p>
        <p>After much experimentation with herbal jet-lag remedies, I've found the retro solution of the tranquilizer works best for me. And, yes, I pack a facial moisturizer -- but only one!</p>
        <p>Besides my kit, on flights five hours or longer I drag along an inexpensive lightweight Indian shawl (not a Pashmina), an inflatable collapsible neck pillow, and two liter bottles of spring water.</p>
        <p>And, if I have time, I pack a lunch -- a really nice one.</p>
        <p>THE BAGGAGE DILEMMA</p>
        <p>For years, I stuffed all my belongings into one carry-on duffel bag, believing the adage that Real Travelers Don't Check Baggage. But in the last year, I've come to believe that that maxim is outdated -- and not because airlines have cracked down on carry-ons.</p>
        <p>The problem isn't the airlines, but that ubiquitous air travelers' accessory, the carry-on wheelie suitcase. Personally, I hate them -- they're bulky, make inefficient use of weight and space, and only make sense in airports and cities with paved sidewalks. But everyone else uses these wheeled albatrosses, which make boarding and deplaning an obstacle course fraught with peril.</p>
        <p>To secure overhead compartment space, you've got to get on the plane early, which is why there's always an unpleasant stampede at the gates. When the flight arrives, a reverse scramble begins as passengers try to heave their trolleys out without inflicting concussions on each other. I stopped taking my bags on planes when I noticed that the process of unloading a gazillion wheeled suitcases from the overheads took so long that by the time I emerged, the checked bags were already rolling around the carousel.</p>
        <p>So far, I've had no problems, and I enjoy being able to walk the ever-increasing distance from security checkpoint to departure gate relatively unencumbered. According to the Federal Department of Transportation's consumer air Web site (www.dot.gov/airconsumer), a fascinating array of statistics on United States airlines that's updated every month (it will tell you, for instance, what percentage of flights left a particular airport on time), baggage complaints among the major carriers are relatively low, on average about 4 per 1,000 bags.</p>
        <p>I think those are pretty good odds -- between them and the tiny, colored Brazilian good-luck ribbons that I tie on my luggage to insure positive baggage juju, I'll continue to check my bags. At least until the airlines ban the wheelies.</p>
        <p>IN-FLIGHT SURVIVAL</p>
        <p>It's a jungle up there in economy class, and while I strive to maintain the civility nurtured by many years of flying in the good old days, I've also learned that the skies belong to the quick, the pushy and the vocal. I don't wait for the flight attendant to get me an extra pillow (I always use two, one for back support, one for my head) -- I look for the bin with the extras, and help myself.</p>
        <p>If my seat turns out to be next to a passenger with an oversized child in his lap, or my seat is broken in some way, I'll find the head flight attendant and complain, and I've even resorted to standing immobile in the aisle to get attention.</p>
        <p>I get up and walk as much as I can, particularly on longer flights. If there's a refueling stop with an option to get off the plane, even for just a half-hour, I take it. Not only does this let me breathe real air but it has also provided me with some unforgettable travel experiences, like being handed a frangipani blossom at 4 a.m. in the Tahiti airport, and shopping for lipstick in the Hong Kong airport after 18 hours with no sleep.</p>
        <p>I strive to detach myself from the unpleasant surroundings and elevator-like crowding (earplugs and meditation really help) and concentrate instead on the small pleasures and unexpected surprises that in spite of the bottom line, airline companies (mostly foreign ones) still offer. Like the little terry cloth socks handed out by Japan Airlines (one of my favorite carriers) and Air New Zealand, the amazing Arabic music channels offered on Gulf Air (which also has some of the roomier coach seats around, and terrific food), or the vintage 1930's Malay films shown  on Malaysia Airlines.</p>
        <p>I adore the new, sharply tailored,  red and yellow uniforms of the Cathay Pacific flight attendants, and I was impressed by the hip in-flight entertainment offered by Varig coming back from Brazil: a full-length concert film of Caetano Veloso.</p>
        <p>But my favorite indulgence, perhaps the last vestige of the elegant early days of commercial air travel,  is offered by Thai Airways to every female passenger as she exits the plane: a fresh orchid corsage.</p>
        <p>With fresh flowers, fuzzy socks, good music and an empty aisle in which to practice my yoga stretches, I just may make it through another 100,000 economy-class miles.</p>
