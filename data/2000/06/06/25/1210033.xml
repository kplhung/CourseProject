        <p>AS baby boomers, we are getting a reputation. We take heat for our questionable cell-phone habits, the big trucks we drive and  our overall obsession with money. Now investment advisers are shaking their heads over how we invest. We are, they say, incredibly risk-prone and oblivious to the lessons of history.</p>
        <p>We know that, of course, and it seems that many of us don't care.</p>
        <p>But I do. I stubbornly hang on to my Coca-Cola and Disney stock, refusing to dump these stodgy issues and invest in dot-coms. I own Treasury bills. About 45 percent of my 401(k) account is in money-market and bond funds, the remainder in a stock fund. I have four children, and that makes me cautious.</p>
        <p>Not so the rest of my generation, said Steven W. Kaye, president of the American Economic Planning Group in Watchung, N.J. Mr. Kaye advises many people my age and is amazed at the chances they take.</p>
        <p>''No group in history has taken on the risks that the baby boomer generation has,'' he said. ''People were more diversified in the past. The generation just before the boomers had a high concentration of health stocks, but nothing like the baby boomers and their technology craze. The group as a whole doesn't seem to care about risk as much.''</p>
        <p>Tom Mucciolo, 45, president of Medianet Inc., a Manhattan company that teaches people how to make presentations, said he does care -- but is confident that he has made the right choice. Almost all of his investments are in stocks, and about 65 percent of those are technology companies. Yes, he knows it's risky. Yes, he knows he's not diversified. ''I'm banking on technology,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''If you talk to an investment adviser, they'll say this guy should have his head examined,'' Mr. Mucciolo added. ''But I'm comfortable with the risk, because it is my risk. I have continual earnings power and time to recover'' if the market falls.</p>
        <p>Howard S. Cohen, 49, a cardiologist in Warren, N.J., said he has about 80 percent of his portfolio in technology stocks. Like Mr. Mucciolo, he is confident in the sector, and in his ability to recover from any downturn. Still, he said, his position makes him nervous.</p>
        <p>''Oh yes, I'm scared,'' he said about the spring meltdown in the Nasdaq. ''When the stock market takes a 30 percent correction, and I'm looking at my savings taking a 30 percent hit, it's very unsettling.''</p>
        <p>He said that he watches the market closely and that he would become more conservative if the market fell into an extended decline, an event he conceded he has never experienced.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaye says that is part of the problem. ''Older people have a better chance of remembering 1972 through '74,'' he said. ''Boomers can't conceive that the S.&amp; P. could lose 50 percent over a three-year period. We're seeing them not being afraid to put 70 percent of their money in technology, because they think that's where the entire future is. They don't realize that there have been other booms and busts, like oil stocks in the early 1980's.''</p>
        <p>He said some boomers had another habit: loading up exclusively on their employer's stock, leaving them doubly vulnerable if their company falters.</p>
        <p>Diane M. Hogan, 43, of Flemington, N.J. accepted that risk with her company, Charles Schwab, which at one time made up most of her portfolio.</p>
        <p>She bought the stock through the employee stock plan, and although she said many friends thought she was crazy, she stuck with the strategy for more than a decade. When she left Schwab last year, the value of her stock had grown to about $4 million. It's hard to point fingers when a strategy works. ''I don't want to say that it was dumb luck, but I just left it there and forgot about it,'' she said. ''I never thought that I would become a multimillionaire.''</p>
        <p>She has since sold much of the Schwab stock, but she remains about 70 percent invested in equities -- although in a more diverse portfolio.</p>
        <p>''I'm a very risky person,'' she said. ''I sort of feel that you have to take some chances.''</p>
        <p>NOT with my money, I don't. Those four college educations I'm facing chase me to work every day, and I'm not about to start playing with the money I've worked so hard to put aside. When my T-bills mature, I'm planning to roll them over, not put the money in the latest start-up. I don't have the stomach for what Mr. Mucciolo thinks is fun.</p>
        <p>''The game itself is the excitement, more than the actual reward,'' he said. ''If every stock went up 1,000 percent, would I stop playing? No, because it's about the activity, not the result of the activity.''</p>
        <p>Or as Dr. Cohen said: ''It's almost like going on a roller-coaster. You look forward to it, it's scary, but if you get through it successfully, it was quite a ride.''</p>
        <p>For the record, I hate roller-coasters.</p>
