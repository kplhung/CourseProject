        <p>The Park View Hotel, at 55 West 110th Street, was once a landing pad for West African immigrants, providing an enduring, if bitter, first impression of New York. Five years ago, there was a term for it: ''Doing the 110.''</p>

        <p>The Park View Hotel, at 55 West 110th Street, was once a landing pad for West African immigrants, providing an enduring, if bitter, first impression of New York. Five years ago, there was a term for it: ''Doing the 110.''</p>
        <p>While they lived there, these recent arrivals worked as taxi drivers, street vendors and students, trying to climb the rungs of New York's economic ladder to escape the grimy gray single-room-occupancy hotel, which they shared with a handful of native New Yorkers, many of them welfare recipients.</p>
        <p>Fast forward five years:</p>
        <p>A group of young Swedish tourists linger in the hotel lobby, which is painted in vibrant blues, oranges and yellows and has large leatherette ottomans dispersed around low-lying tables. They plan a day of trips downtown, as clerks at the front desk, wearing matching orange suits, chirpily greet arriving guests from France or England.</p>
        <p>The Park View, like much of this block on the northern edge of Central Park, has undergone an enormous transition in recent years. Now a refurbished youth hostel, the hotel, owned by Tenrit Studios, charges visitors $26 to $110 a night for either a shared or private room.</p>
        <p>Among the other nearby improvements, the Harlem Meer, the 11-acre lake at the northeastern edge of the park, was restored during the 1990's with the help of the Central Park Conservancy. And the Transit Authority recently completed renovation of the subway station at 110th Street and Lenox Avenue, which had been shuttered for 15 years.</p>
        <p>Responding to the change, local businesses have cleaned up their storefronts and added matching green awnings to create a uniform look. Aliyyah Baylor, president of Make My Cake, which owns a bakery on 110th Street, grew up in the neighborhood and has seen the change.</p>
        <p>''You've got the same people here, but the appearance is different,'' she said. ''There has been a redeveloping of businesses that were not in operation for many years. You have landlords who are now going for a different look, more of a comfortable look, not just your average bodega.''</p>
        <p>Gunnar Carlson, a 26-year-old Swede who was visiting his fellow tourists in the Park View lobby, said he had gone to 110th Street the last time he was in New York, in 1993. ''It's a lot nicer now than it was then,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But not everyone sees this change as positive. Elizabeth Kane, director of the West Side S.R.O. Law Project, a tenant group, said that in the Park View renovation  many tenants ''were brutally treated and driven out of the building.''</p>
        <p>Tenrit Studios did not respond to numerous requests for comment. But Robert Blanche, the general manager of the Park View Hotel, said 50 permanent tenants remained in the building and that the owners  had tried to be sensitive to their needs since they bought the building in October 1999.</p>
        <p>''I don't know about any complaints,'' he said. ''But we've turned this property around 250 percent, not only for the permanent tenants but for the community at large.''</p>
