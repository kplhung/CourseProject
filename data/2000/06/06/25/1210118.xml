        <p>ORIGINATING in the time when a ''hi-fi'' with detachable speakers was considered modern music technology, the Who has spanned every generation in between those pre-psychedelic days and today when downloadable music from the Internet is becoming the norm.</p>
        <p>In between, the Who has made some of the most memorable music of the rock 'n' roll era and the group is returning to the road this summer to play the greatest hits, including some of the pieces from the ground-breaking rock opera ''Tommy.''</p>
        <p>The Who was created in London in 1959 when the singer Roger Daltry, the guitarist and songwriter Peter Townsend, and the bass player and songwriter John Entwistle got together and began making the rounds of local clubs as the Detours. Four years later, Keith Moon replaced Doug Sandom as drummer and the history-making foursome was reborn under the puzzling name the Who.</p>
        <p>Between then and Mr. Moon's death in 1978, the Who, along with the Rolling Stones and the Beatles before them, defined rock 'n' roll, not only for Europe, but for the United States as well. At the same time, the Who became one of rock's longest-running bands with no personnel changes.</p>
        <p>In that time the band recorded ''I Can't Explain,'' the first song to be a hit, reaching No. 9 on the British pop charts. That was followed by ''My Generation,'' ''Magic Bus'' and in 1969 the rock opera ''Tommy,'' the story of a blind, deaf boy who becomes a pinball wizard and discovers the world's, and his own, need for a Messiah.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Townsend, who wrote ''Tommy'' and most of the other Who material, has since said he has grown tired of the story, it still resonates with audiences far beyond the 60's generation and was turned into a Broadway play, and then a road show that is still being performed in theaters around the world.</p>
        <p>There were a lot of ''bad boys of rock 'n' roll'' in those days, and the Who became as well known for destroying their guitars and amplifiers on stage as they were for playing them, a gimmick the members dropped in Europe but kept in the United States for a number of years after the band's popularity transcended the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Mr. Townsend said he could not write another album for the Who and the members went their separate ways after Keith Moon's death, with Mr. Townsend recording a number of critically acclaimed solo albums, including one based on a British children's story. Roger Daltry went on to do movies and solo albums and Mr. Entwistle has appeared in a number of bands made up of some of rock's biggest stars.</p>
        <p>By 1989 the group was ready to form again, despite some personal differences, and they hit the summer concert tour with ''The Kids Are Alright'' tour, including a multiple-night stand at the Meadowlands stadium in East Rutherford, in which they played most of ''Tommy.''</p>
        <p>The band members were not so young anymore, but they also showed one of their early wishes, ''I hope I die before I grow old,'' might not have come true. The three original members had grown older but no less talented. Mr. Townsend was still doing the airplane guitar strokes that were his trademark and Mr. Daltry remained one of the few performers to use a wired microphone so he could swing it through the air during the songs.</p>
        <p>Four years ago the band came back to smaller theaters, playing at the Blockbuster Sony Entertainment Center in Camden and the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel. The Who performed the entire score of ''Quadrophenia,'' the group's second rock opera, which tells the story of the clash between the British mods and rockers at a British seashore town.</p>
        <p>Now they are back in support of the newest album, ''The Blues to the Bush,'' on Musicmaker.com, which uses Internet technology to allow fans to select the songs they want and the order in which they appear.</p>
        <p>The album is made up of live songs played during the fall of 1999 at the House of Blues in Chicago and Shepherd's Bush Empire in London. It includes such classics as ''Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere,'' ''Baba O'Riley,'' ''Pure and Easy,'' which never made it to an album previously, and ''After the Fire,'' which has never been recorded by the band before.</p>
        <p>As in other recent tours, Zak Starkey, the son of Ringo Starr, plays drums and John (Rabbit) Bundrick plays keyboards.</p>
        <p>In an era when many older rock bands are staging reunion tours, the original members of the Who, who rode the British invasion into rock 'n' roll history more than three decades ago, are putting on a reunion show that breathes new life into well-known songs.</p>
