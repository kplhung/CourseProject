        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The World Health Organization's report on the alarming increases in drug-resistant microbes (editorial, June 18) should cause concern in the wealthiest nations and the poorest.</p>
        <p>Viral diseases like AIDS and hepatitis B and C, which occur globally, are also prime candidates for resistance. Only five years after the development of combination therapy for H.I.V., a large percentage of new infections are at least partly resistant to treatment.</p>
        <p>Doctors and experts in drug development must acknowledge that drug treatment is no longer a ''one size fits all'' proposition. Academic, government and commercial researchers must cooperate to slow and stop emerging epidemics of drug-resistant micro-organisms. This effort is under way in H.I.V. research and can serve as a model for others.</p>
