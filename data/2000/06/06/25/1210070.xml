        <p>ON Memorial Day weekend, Jonathan Svec's father realized his 29-year-old-son was indeed a rock star.</p>
        <p>Never mind the 15,000 screaming adolescents at the Jones Beach theater that night, or the hit song ''I Think God Can Explain'' making Billboard's Top 40, or even VH1 running the band's music video.</p>
        <p>It was Jonathan Svec's attempt to leave the theater when a girl spotted him and screamed, ''OH MY GOD!'' and he was nearly crushed by a throng of fans.</p>
        <p>''I grabbed him by the arm and pulled him out, we had to run away,'' said his father, Kenneth Svec. ''We finally got to the car and he said to me, 'Dad, I TOLD you!' '' Kenneth Svec added, ''That was the moment I understood. That was cool for me.''</p>
        <p>Jonathan Svec plays lead guitar for a rock group called Splender. But many people in the Stamford area, where he grew up, remember him as the young classical pianist who went into his father's piano service business.</p>
        <p>Before Splender performed that night at Jones Beach, they spoke with a visitor in their dressing room backstage. They walked in, wearing mostly black leather.</p>
        <p>Marc Slutsky's muscular arms gave away the fact that he was the drummer. He grew up two miles away from the beach, he said, played drums in his school band and went to the Manhattan School of Music.</p>
        <p>The bass guitarist James Cruz, age 30, before teaming up with Splender's lead vocalist and songwriter Waymon Boone in 1991, was a studio musician in New York City; his mother was a singer and his father a guitarist. Mr. Boone, also 30, learned how to sing as a youngster on the road with his mother; his first gig was singing in a bar when he was 15. (The group's members all had musically gifted mothers.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Svec joined the group three years ago, answering an advertisement in the Village Voice. He described how it came about: ''The Connecticut scene was not happening, so I moved into the city, had tons of auditions -- there's so much mediocre stuff out there. Right before I left to go back to Connecticut -- I was so disgusted -- I called some ads in the Village Voice one of the last days I was there. Two weeks later I got a message, it was Waymon. I had an audition the next day in New York City and within the week of learning a bunch of songs, that first time we played together everybody knew. James said, 'we dig you, we want you in the band.' That was so awesome.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boone, who writes all the songs, sings the lead vocals and plays guitar, said that Mr. Svec brings a harmony to the group. ''I've never been happier with any other guitar player,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I Think God Can Explain,'' as of the week ending June 11, was No. 29 and climbing on Billboard's Top 40. The band's CD has sold 125,000 copies. Tomorrow night Splender will be performing the song on the Tonight Show With Jay Leno on NBC.</p>
        <p>A ballad, the song opens with Mr. Svec's ringing electric 12-string guitar. Mr. Boone strums his acoustic guitar and sings profoundly about rejection.</p>
        <p>The song has universal appeal and has been interpreted in numerous ways, including an explanation for having cancer, according to a girl's posting on the band's bulletin board on their Web site.</p>
        <p>''The song is a true story about a stalker, seen from his point of view,'' said Mr. Boone. He went on to say it was the easiest song to write and the hardest to record. ''To capture everything about it,'' he said, ''finding the song's center, remixing, re-remixing, and then to see it take off.'' Mr. Svec added, ''It's not violent; just a love-gone-bad thing, someone who can't let go.''</p>
        <p>How do the songs evolve?</p>
        <p>''Waymon comes up with a basic idea for a song,'' Mr. Svec said. ''He comes in with it half-finished, with a one-  to two-chord kind of thing. I add in melodic lines, make certain changes. I make up my own chords; I use a lot of broken up sevenths and sixths.'' Like Mr. Boone's lyrics, Mr. Svec's chord progressions and use of suspensions create ambivalence and tension, without too much anxiety.</p>
        <p>Mr. Svec said he was about 14 years old when he picked up the guitar. For six years before that he had taken piano lessons, participating in Schubert Club musicales and winning competitions at the University of Bridgeport. He said he began losing interest in the piano when baseball and rock music captured his imagination. ''I'd always loved Queen, Kiss, AC-DC, The Who -- the sensationalism,'' he said. ''I would air-guitar on top of my bed. My Grandma told me I was humming Beatles songs before I could speak.''</p>
        <p>Riding bikes one day with his brother changed his life. ''New people were moving into the neighborhood,'' he said, ''and there was a guitar plugged in the garage, really loud -- I was stupefied.''</p>
        <p>The older teenager playing the guitar taught Mr. Svec for free. Mr. Svec played in rock bands all through high school, and went to the Shenandoah Conservatory of Music in West Virginia where he earned a degree in piano technology and to the North Bennett Street School in Boston where he got a certificate in advanced piano restoration. He returned home to Stamford and went to work tuning pianos in his father's business in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>''Just being in front of 88 keys, to play them and learn about the intervals and harmonies, it opened up another side of musical training,'' said Mr. Svec, who has perfect pitch. ''I loved tuning pianos; it was technical as well as musical. And I got to meet some really great musicians. It was the perfect marriage of a job and being a musician.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Svec joined Splender (the name comes from the movie ''Splendor in the Grass''), they changed the spelling, they said, because the last two letters in splendor appeared ''too Gothic'' for their tastes.</p>
        <p>The band had already been rejected by every major and minor record label. One executive heard their demonstration recording in 1996, and a year later, Splender had a contract with Columbia Records Group/Sony Music. Mr. Boone and Mr. Cruz said the preceding nine years were like being in medical school.</p>
        <p>The group had an inventory of more than 50 songs. The record producer (and performing artist) Todd Rundgren chose 14 for the first CD, released last year, called ''Halfway Down the Sky,'' a reference to where they feel they are in their career as a group right now.</p>
        <p>As show time neared at the Jones Beach theater, the group's members started to get a little restless; Mr. Svec had to eat, and he and Mr. Cruz would sit down and draw Indian-style  designs in henna on their hands, a pre-concert ritual. Out in the arena among the thousands of fans, the pitch went from scream to shriek when Splender made their entrance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boone worked the crowd while Mr. Slutsky's drums pounded in a slow steady beat for the group's song ''Spaceboy.'' Mr. Cruz's bass rumbled, and Mr. Svec, stepping to the edge of the stage, rang out his opening riff. Mr. Boone stood in the center, with the drummer directly behind and up on a riser. Mr. Svec was to the left and Mr. Cruz to the right, both tall and lanky bookends in black leather, all four moving as one.</p>
        <p>Splender will be appearing with Third Eye Blind and Vertical Horizon at the SNET Oakdale Theater in Wallingford on July 30 at 7:30 p.m. The number to call for tickets and information is (203) 265-1501.</p>
