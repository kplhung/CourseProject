        <p>Ramiro Mendoza was not even supposed to be in the starting rotation for the Yankees this season. The Yankees had marquee names like David Cone, Roger Clemens, Orlando Hernandez and Andy Pettitte, and they wanted the fifth starter to be the unproven rookie Ed Yarnall. As always, Mendoza was destined to do the grunt work in the bullpen.</p>
        <p>Now the season is almost half over, the Yankees' rotation has been plagued by injuries and underachievement, and Mendoza, the versatile pitcher, has evolved into the most consistent starter on the team. Mendoza helped the Yankees finally stop the White Sox, 12-8, winning his second straight start during a stretch of 10 games in which the wobbly Yankees have won one other game. It was the first time the Yankees beat Chicago in six games over the last nine days.</p>
        <p>But Mendoza was subdued and confused after the long and lousy game in which Manager Joe Torre summoned Mariano Rivera with a five-run lead in the eighth inning, after the Yankees had juggled a 10-1 bulge. Mendoza had to leave in the sixth with stiffness in his right shoulder and is concerned about why it has hampered him this season. He missed one start in May because of the same problem and did not eliminate the possibility of asking the Yankees to conduct more medical tests.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, I'm scared,'' Mendoza said. ''I don't know why it's sore when I pitch. That's scary. I want to pitch.''</p>
        <p>With Clemens and Hernandez injured, Cone stuck on one victory and the rookie Ben Ford in the rotation, Mendoza has become even more valuable. Torre said that the stiffness bothers Mendoza, but that it will not prevent him from making his next start. The pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre said he is not concerned because the trainers monitor Mendoza daily and they do not think it is serious.</p>
        <p>''It's something that we have to watch closely,'' Stottlemyre said. ''I don't think it's a major concern.''</p>
        <p>If Mendoza missed time, it would be damaging to the Yankees because he has been their most reliable pitcher. Stottlemyre does not think Mendoza's stiffness is related to his extensive work as a starter, but Mendoza, who has been more of a reliever, has left his last two starts after 79 and 74 pitches.</p>
        <p>''This is not something that is debilitating,'' Torre said. ''It's something we need to take care of, which we do. We might try to do other things to treat it between starts.''</p>
        <p>Three times in the past two weeks the Yankees have desperately needed a victory and Mendoza has produced each time. He relieved an injured Clemens in the second inning on June 14 and worked five and two-thirds shutout innings in equaling Boston's Pedro Martinez and helping the Yankees prevail, 3-1.</p>
        <p>After the Yankees sauntered into Fenway Park with a four-game losing streak, Mendoza tamed Boston in a 22-1 rout. One day after Rivera botched a save opportunity in a devastating 4-3 loss to the White Sox here on Friday, Mendoza was cool as he surrendered three runs in five innings and was supported by Bernie Williams's four hits and Shane Spencer's four runs batted in. So, if Mendoza is scared, the Yankees should be a little scared, too.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what's going on,'' Mendoza said. ''I get sore.''</p>
        <p>Torre does not like to bring Rivera into games in the eighth unless it is absolutely essential, and he felt that way today, even though the Yankees had a five-run lead. Yes, Torre clearly wanted the victory. Though Rivera needed to get only five outs before he permitted five runs, the Yankees still sweated before prevailing.</p>
        <p>With the Yankees leading, 10-5, the bases loaded and Frank Thomas batting in the eighth, Torre asked Rivera to stop the madness. Thomas hammered Rivera's first pitch far, deep and foul down the left-field line. Thomas wound up with a sacrifice fly and Magglio Ordonez singled in a run to trim the deficit to three, but Rivera muddled through the eighth and ninth to get the save and end a rainy, sloppy affair.</p>
        <p>''I'm just happy we were able to hold on,'' Torre said. ''We're going to save this video, put it in a time capsule and, in 100 years from now, people will see how baseball shouldn't be played.''</p>
