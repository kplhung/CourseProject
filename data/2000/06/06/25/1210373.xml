        <p>The trial judge in the Microsoft antitrust case surprised everyone by ordering a postponement of the conduct restrictions he imposed just two weeks earlier until appeals are complete. In the same order he certified the case for direct appeal to the Supreme Court. Microsoft was jubilant; penalties that were to take effect in September are now on hold for at least a year, maybe longer. But some government officials say they believe Microsoft, freed from scrutiny for a while, might continue the sort of behavior that got the company in trouble to begin with, and help convince the appeals courts to uphold the lower court's ruling.</p>
