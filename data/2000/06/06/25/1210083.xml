        <p>THINK laundry room and you probably think, well, dirty clothes.</p>
        <p>But think again. The laundry rooms being built today are not what they used to be -- or where they used to be.</p>
        <p>Just ask Erin Earley, as she pores over blueprints for the expansion of the Mount Kisco home she shares with her new husband, Mike Ginsburg.</p>
        <p>''We've decided to put our laundry room on the first floor, here,'' she said, pointing to the plan, ''between the mud room and the powder room. At first, we were concerned that guests would be walking through the laundry room to get to the powder room, but then we decided: 'Hey, everyone does laundry. There's nothing to hide.' ''</p>
        <p>Her architect, Peter Cole, of Peter A. Cole Architect in Chappaqua, sees a trend. ''What I'm finding,'' he said, ''is that as people are building larger homes for larger families, they're pulling the laundry room out of the basement. It's not convenient there; it's not where you're spending time, and it's not where the laundry is being generated.''</p>
        <p>As Ms. Earley puts it, ''You never get undressed in the basement.''</p>
        <p>Instead, the decision is to locate the laundry room on the first or second floor. ''If you do laundry during the day, you'd want it on the first floor, because that's where you are,'' said Mr. Cole. ''You'd just have to position it so it's not too noisy.'' Another option, he suggested, was building a laundry room next to a mud room, where some of the utilities, like a large sink, could be shared.</p>
        <p>Second-floor laundry rooms tend to be smaller, Mr. Cole said, with a more compact washer and dryer, often stacked, as upstairs space is at a premium. ''This is where they'll do a quick load at the end of the day, or where the children can do their own laundry,'' he said. ''Since they're using it for shorter stints, noise is less of a factor.''</p>
        <p>He said that homes with second-floor laundry rooms may also have a larger laundry room in the basement for bigger loads, like sheets and tablecloths. ''If there is household help,'' he said, ''this is the laundry room they'll use.''</p>
        <p>The laundry room of today is larger than its predecessor, with more room to hang clothes, more counter top area for folding, and -- if the room includes an ironing board -- space for a television set as well.</p>
        <p>Ms. Earley's laundry room incorporates a retractable clothesline and an oversize storage closet where she will keep her vacuum cleaner, broom and mop and household cleaning products. ''I'd rather keep them there than under the kitchen sink,'' she said, ''where we're going to have our recycling anyway.''</p>
        <p>As for advances in washing machines, a consumer-size front-loader is what's hot. Richard Kreutzberg of Richie's Appliance Service, with offices in Yorktown Heights, Yonkers and White Plains, said: 'It's much more energy efficient, and it uses less water because there is no center post. It has the largest load capacity  -- up to 20 pounds -- but it uses less detergent and less bleach. So it's really the way to go.''</p>
        <p>It's the way Ms. Earley and Mr. Ginsburg are going. ''We've decided on a front-loading washer,'' Ms. Earley said. ''It's the latest thing. We're also considering stacking our washer and dryer, since it was pointed out to us that it'll cut our bending time in half.''</p>
        <p>And the newest in dryers? Mr. Kreutzberg said, ''Dryers are pretty  much all the same.'' Unlike the laundry room of the past, an often poorly lighted, dank corner of a cement basement, the laundry room of today is an integral part of the design of the home.</p>
        <p>''We're considering the laundry room as part of the house,'' Ms. Early said. ''We want it to look nice. We'll be continuing the tile from the mud room, through the laundry room and into the powder room. We may put a wooden counter top in the room that matches the island in our kitchen. And we'll be tiling the walls. The washer and dryer will be behind folding doors, both for noise reduction and for aesthetics. It'll be a fully  finished room, a part of the decor of the house.''</p>
        <p>And her ironing board? ''There'll be no ironing board in the laundry room,'' Ms. Earley asserted. ''I'll take the ironing elsewhere. Our laundry room will be as pleasant as possible, but not pleasant enough for ironing.''</p>
        <p>Feng Shui to the Rescue. It's All Location.</p>
        <p>BELINDA DING-POLERA looks at laundry rooms from a spiritual perspective as she and her partner, Ellen Leitenberger, consult with clients of their Briarcliff-based company, Feng Shui Solutions.</p>
        <p>''The goal of Feng Shui is to make the house's energy flow for everyone who lives there,'' Ms. Ding-Polera said. ''You want to make each room  as unstagnant as possible.''</p>
        <p>Generally, she said, the laundry room is placed in one of the worst locations ''That is because laundry is dirty,'' she said, ''and you don't want to use the best positions.''</p>
        <p>A house is divided into nine sectors, in a tic-tac-toe-like grid, she explained, with the center being the most potent. ''That's the heart of the house,'' she said. ''You want to leave it open. You wouldn't put a staircase there, or any kind of plumbing. That wouldn't be the place for a laundry room.''</p>
        <p>The laundry room goes in the  ''storage sector'', as does the garage, Ms. Ding-Polera said. ''it's these areas that are placed in the least desirable locations, energy-wise.''</p>
        <p>Placement aside, Ms. Ding-Polera believes the laundry room is frequently the most neglected room of the house. ''Too often,'' she said,  ''there's not enough shelving. Everything is on the floor, and there's no place for the clothes. It's cluttered;  accidents happen easily, and when you come back from the laundry room, you end up feeling frustrated.''</p>
        <p>To remedy this, she suggested: ''Make it bright. Lighting is very  important to the feel of a room. And make it friendly. Have plenty of  shelving, and make some of it low enough for the kids to reach so they will be encouraged to do their own laundry. Keep it organized and uncluttered and try to find room for a table or surface area where you can fold your clothes. Otherwise, if they sit too long in the laundry basket, they will get wrinkled.''</p>
        <p>When ironing out those wrinkles, Ms. Ding-Polera advised keeping a  distance between the washing machine and the ironing board, perhaps separating them with a wooden wall.  ''Feng Shui principles are based on the four elements,'' she said. ''Fire and water don't mix. You don't want your ironing board, which is heat, too close to your washing machine, which is water.''</p>
