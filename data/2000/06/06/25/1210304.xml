        <p>Technology stocks took more jolts last week as investors locked in profits after the sector's recent runup and looked for bargains.</p>
        <p>Among the leading decliners was Amazon.com, the online retailer. The stock plunged after a Lehman Brothers report warned of risks facing the company, which has built itself into a Web superstore but has yet to turn a profit. Yahoo and eBay fell in sympathy.</p>
        <p>But analysts said investors should not make too much of the market's moves, noting that trading volume remained low in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting this week. Some economists predict that the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged because the economy is showing signs of slowing.</p>
        <p>Dan Ascani, research director at Global Market Strategist, said that for now, the focus of trading is on profit taking and bargain hunting.</p>
        <p>Investors and portfolio managers are trying to be more prudent about taking profits on stocks that have rebounded, and at the same time, moving into stocks that have been depressed, Mr. Ascani said.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week at 10,404.75, down 44.55, while the Nasdaq composite index closed at 3,845.34, off 15.22.</p>
