        <p>TRAVELING makes me hungry. I want comfort food when I'm bored and lonely, and exhaustion and enforced waiting combine to make me ravenous; only huge quantities of protein will do the trick. Anxiety brings a craving for calming carbohydrates. So the one good thing about sitting in a plane, where I'm almost always bored, lonely, exhausted and anxious, is that the fierce demands of my stomach keep me from worrying whether the mechanics remembered to check the flaps.</p>
        <p>Although I have learned, to my relief, that the airlines get me where I want to go, I have also learned, to my chagrin, that I cannot count on them to feed me. This holds true even in the relatively luxurious confines of business class, where we are all either traveling on someone else's dollar or cashing in on tens of thousands of miles of past suffering. Here, the galley might conceivably prepare a piece of beef that is both rare and hot (you'll never see that in economy), but it still won't be appealing -- not by a long shot.</p>

        <p>TRAVELING makes me hungry. I want comfort food when I'm bored and lonely, and exhaustion and enforced waiting combine to make me ravenous; only huge quantities of protein will do the trick. Anxiety brings a craving for calming carbohydrates. So the one good thing about sitting in a plane, where I'm almost always bored, lonely, exhausted and anxious, is that the fierce demands of my stomach keep me from worrying whether the mechanics remembered to check the flaps.</p>
        <p>Although I have learned, to my relief, that the airlines get me where I want to go, I have also learned, to my chagrin, that I cannot count on them to feed me. This holds true even in the relatively luxurious confines of business class, where we are all either traveling on someone else's dollar or cashing in on tens of thousands of miles of past suffering. Here, the galley might conceivably prepare a piece of beef that is both rare and hot (you'll never see that in economy), but it still won't be appealing -- not by a long shot.</p>
        <p>And in coach, where almost everyone travels all the time, people rarely get sick from eating airplane food, but horror stories abound: pasta cooked to death, half-frozen salads, indescribable flavors, unidentifiable vegetables, leathery meat, leathery chicken, mushy fish, undercooked food, overcooked food (the norm), even uncooked food (one of my daughters was once served raw rice), and now overly ambitious ingredients. What gave the airlines the idea they should start messing around with croissants when they have yet to serve a decent piece of bread?</p>
        <p>But one must eat. And for the hungry traveler, nothing describes the situation better than the old joke about the hotel in the Catskills: Not only is the food bad but the portions are also too small. Every road warrior has had an experience like this one: Start a meeting at 11 a.m., preferably in an earlier-than-usual time zone, so you're hungry already. Sprint for a two-hour flight, with no time to grab anything, and be handed a ''bistro meal'' on your way onto the plane, or be informed that you will be served ''a light snack.''</p>
        <p>At times like these you'll eat anything. When you're begging for a second bag of peanuts (the flight attendants will generally take pity, and even allow three or four), even the thought of smoked turkey and American cheese on a soggy croissant with yellow mustard and wilted lettuce (served with a box of raisins the size of a priority-mail stamp and a brownie so sweet your teeth hurt) can make your mouth water. And the reality of one of those sandwiches is enough to make you really believe that your heart and stomach long for nothing more than baked tortellini with cheese sauce or steak in wine sauce (known in high school as Salisbury steak, and little changed since then).</p>
        <p>Some airlines hire chef consultants. They correctly perceive the situation as a public relations problem, but incorrectly believe that by attaching a chef's name to a bad meal it will magically become a good one. Although chefs can provide ingenious recipes, they cannot compensate for third-rate ingredients, precooking in stages, freezing and thawing, microwaving and reheating, and cafeteria- and battlefieldlike conditions. Substitutions and shortcuts are fine, but you still cannot make roast chicken without a chicken and an oven.</p>
        <p>The concept should be straightforward: Simple food is best. After all there is nothing inherently wrong with a sandwich. But whether airline food is simple or complicated, it's executed miserably. It simply isn't worth the money for airlines to serve good food.</p>
        <p>It might be argued, and not entirely without logic, that the airlines believe that Americans don't care about food, that we view it strictly as fuel -- fill 'er up, who cares about the brand, and there's always more where that came from.</p>
        <p>But the I-can't-believe-they're-serving-this phenomenon is not limited to domestic airlines or flights; United States-based companies may set the pace, but the pattern holds true around the world, and some of the guiltiest airlines are those originating in the countries whose cuisines are, theoretically at least, superior.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the theory is that we travelers somehow lose our ability to tell the difference between marginally appealing food with some flavor and that which could only be considered when the alternative is crankiness or worse. But even fast food has punch, and recent years have seen a move away from blandness and toward bigger flavors, not only in top restaurants but everywhere. No one in his right mind prefers a soggy whole-wheat croissant with off-colored meat and warm American cheese to, say, a good bag of Doritos and a can of jalapeno dip, or a few Chicken McNuggets.</p>
        <p>And proof that travelers remain conscious of what they eat is as obvious as the permanent lines that are found at the food courts in some of the busiest and most recently remodeled airports, like those of Pittsburgh and Dallas.</p>
        <p>Here, the cheap, relatively flavorful, and popular food of normal daily life is sold by the ton. Happily coexisting, at prices significantly higher than those two miles down the road, are McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Pizza Hut and more. These places are almost always crowded, and the people crowding them are either (a) about to get on a plane, knowing that this common fare will be far superior to the food served on board; or (b) just getting off a plane and don't even have the strength to pick up their bags without fortifying themselves after the enforced starvation of the flight.</p>
        <p>In my nontravel life, I no more eat voluntarily at these places than I  drive to the airport and try to buy flight food. Yet I'm on those lines at the food courts whenever I have the time, and whenever I think a Whopper will save me from eating the plane's cheese tortellini.</p>
        <p>Nor am I alone. Increasingly, my fellow travelers board planes with McDonald's sack in hand, merrily (or at least hungrily) tuck into their Quarter Pounder while the plane is still at the gate, and happily work or sleep through the meal service. Others carry snacks along with their laptops. Some make do with an apple, or just skip lunch or dinner. And no one I've spoken with feels happy about the situation.</p>
        <p>It's about money. The airlines' food budgets are set, and the small portions of bad food must be delivered quickly and their detritus removed just as fast.</p>
        <p>There is little doubt that instant meals mean smaller galleys -- which in turn mean more seats -- and in many instances may require one attendant less.</p>
        <p>Yet having established a tradition of feeding us, the airlines should make an attempt to do it with the same amount of class and elan with which they do everything else.</p>
        <p>Oh, now I get it. Never mind.</p>
