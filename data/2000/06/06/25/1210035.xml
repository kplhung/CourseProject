        <p>SIERRA LEONE has been in the news for its horrific civil war --  infamous especially for the rebels' amputations of civilians' limbs --  and for a new United Nations report ranking the country last in ''healthy life expectancy.''</p>
        <p>Against this backdrop, what can a modest people-to-people effort between New Haven and Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, hope to accomplish?</p>
        <p>Undeterred by the enormity of the problems, Freetown/New Haven Sister Cities Inc. packed up a large container of material aid on June 10 to assuage some of the physical, mental and emotional wounds of war. Nearly 100 people attended the send-off of the container. An African drummer and dancer provided ''work songs'' while volunteers loaded boxes into the container. The shipment left New Haven and is currently waiting to be shipped from New York (a departure date is imminent). It will take three weeks to reach Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>Freetown/New Haven Sister Cities was founded in 1996 and is the youngest of New Haven's six sister city relationships, albeit one with perhaps the oldest roots. The roots go back to 1839, when the Amistad incident galvanized anti-slavery forces in Connecticut, and especially New Haven.</p>
        <p>A statue of the leader of the Amistad revolt, Sengbe Pieh (known in the United States as Joseph Cinque) stands in a place of honor in front of New Haven City Hall. His great-great-grandson, Michael Pieh of Farmington, said a prayer over the shipment after it was packed.</p>
        <p>There have been ongoing connections between Freetown and New Haven over the years, including visiting delegations from Sierra Leone for the dedication of the statue in 1992 and for the 1995 Special Olympics. It was through the Special Olympics that Althea Norcott, a school administrator and chairwoman of the sister city organization in New Haven, got involved.</p>
        <p>She volunteered to help Timothy Shriver, who at the time was the key organizer of that worldwide event in New Haven. ''At the last minute,'' said Ms. Norcott, ''Sierra Leone wanted to come. They had no host town. Tim Shriver told me that was my job.''</p>
        <p>She organized other volunteers, and through her hosting duties met many of the Sierra Leonean athletes, coaches and the mayor of Freetown. When they left, she said Al Marder, the chairman of the Amistad Committee, pointed out that New Haven had no sister city in Africa and that Freetown was a perfect choice.</p>
        <p>In 1997, 12 members of the sister city committee went to Sierra Leone ''on a fact-finding tour to see how we could help them,'' Ms. Norcott said. From its inception, the sister city effort has included Sierra Leoneans who now live in the New Haven area. Ngadi Osadebe was born in New Haven and  lived in Freetown for eight years. She returned to New Haven in 1984. The school she attended in Freetown, St. Joseph's Secondary School, has received $1,800 from the sister city organization to build a new roof.</p>
        <p>''I think it's very valuable,'' Ms. Osadebe, now a Hamden resident, said of the project. ''It provides a focus for attention to be put there and in the future will provide for cultural and professional exchanges. Right now we can help the people in the refugee camps. People are really needy there and anything would be appreciated.''</p>
        <p>She pointed out that the country has an elected leader in Mohammed Tejan Kabbah, although his term has been interrupted twice by coups. ''It's so sad that this country, which was called the Athens of West Africa because of its university system, is in such turmoil now,'' Ms. Osadebe added.</p>
        <p>Marvel Sawyer is another member of the sister city group from Sierra Leone. She  came to the United States 10 years ago and has lived in North Haven for five years.</p>
        <p>Although none of her immediate family has been caught in the war, she has other relatives who are still there. She said communication with them was next to impossible.</p>
        <p>''They are very nervous, and don't know what's in their future,'' Ms. Sawyer said. ''The war is still going on, with different factions operating in different parts of the country. When I left in 1991, there was peace; it's hard to picture this war.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Sawyer said she has collected clothing and other donations from her friends  and co-workers. ''Even if they don't go to my family members,'' she said, ''I feel like I am helping my family.''</p>
        <p>Ursula Hanciles left Sierra Leone in 1997 and moved to Bridgeport last September. She and her two children came to the loading. She said the hardest thing about living through the war was not knowing what to expect.</p>
        <p>''Most of the rebels dressed in plain clothes, so we did not know whom to talk to or who might attack us,'' Ms. Hanciles said.</p>
        <p>She said of the material aid, ''Every little thing helps, but the most important thing is knowing that other people are thinking  about you from so far away. You don't feel so isolated.''</p>
        <p>On loading day, volunteers packed almost 400 boxes filled with clothing, personal care items, school supplies and medical equipment into a container that measured 20 feet by 10 feet by 10 feet.</p>
        <p>An X-ray machine, valued at $20,000, was donated by a doctor who learned of the project through the Hospital of St. Raphael in New Haven, which Ms. Norcott said has enthusiastically promoted her group's effort.</p>
        <p>Ms. Norcott said the group had raised the $4,500 that it will cost to send the shipment. ''The shipping company,'' she said, ''is a little afraid of going to Sierra Leone, so they  want some expenses upfront.''</p>
        <p>Remedy, a nationwide medical relief effort founded by Yale physician William Rosenblatt, contributed many items to this shipment. Specialized Packing International donated 250 boxes, and several churches, banks and other community institutions made donations or played host to fund-raisers. Especially supportive were the local chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, The Girl Friends Inc., and Dixwell Avenue Congregational United Church of Christ, which stored the ever-growing contributions and which served as the group's meeting and packing site.</p>
        <p>The church's connections with Sierra Leone go back to the Amistad. Its current pastor, Reverend John Henry Scott III, explained that the church was founded in 1820 by a white abolitionist and 24 former slaves.</p>
        <p>The congregation was a founding member of the original Amistad Committee in 1839, set up to defend the captive Africans and fight for their freedom. Mr. Scott said the committee's efforts to send the container to Sierra Leone has been ''a multiracial, multicultural experience, just like the work of the Amistad Committee. It's a continuation of the care we have had for Sierra Leone. Issues of justice are as important today as they were in 1820 when slavery was going on.''</p>
        <p>The container is padlocked and given an identification number. Shirley Gbujama, Sierra Leone's minister of social welfare, gender and children's affairs will claim the  container when it arrives. Then she will just cut off the padlock. Ms. Norcott said to a certain extent it's an ''act of faith'' on her part that the shipment will reach its destination.</p>
        <p>Ms. Norcott said the truck couldn't hold all the donated items, so the committee is planning on sending another shipment in the fall.</p>
        <p>''The next time,'' she said, ''we're going to concentrate on sending crutches, wheelchairs, canes and walkers for all the amputees.''</p>
