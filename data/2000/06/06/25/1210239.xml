        <p>One might consider the musical pairing of, say, Antonio Vivaldi of Italy and the Wu-Tang Clan of Staten Island to be one wacky idea. But Marie-Claire Giraud, a classically trained singer raised in the Bronx, begs to differ. The 28-year-old mezzo-soprano, who can belt out a perfect French aria at the drop of a chapeau, is trying to introduce a brand-new musical style, an unlikely fusion of rap and opera that she calls hip-hopera.</p>
        <p>Though her lyrics are often dark, Ms. Giraud, a native of Dominica, is perpetually sunny. Currently making the rounds of major record labels, she arrives at company offices armed only with a winning smile and a little cassette. She breaks into song without notice, and the first few notes pierce the air with startling clarity.</p>

        <p>One might consider the musical pairing of, say, Antonio Vivaldi of Italy and the Wu-Tang Clan of Staten Island to be one wacky idea. But Marie-Claire Giraud, a classically trained singer raised in the Bronx, begs to differ. The 28-year-old mezzo-soprano, who can belt out a perfect French aria at the drop of a chapeau, is trying to introduce a brand-new musical style, an unlikely fusion of rap and opera that she calls hip-hopera.</p>
        <p>Though her lyrics are often dark, Ms. Giraud, a native of Dominica, is perpetually sunny. Currently making the rounds of major record labels, she arrives at company offices armed only with a winning smile and a little cassette. She breaks into song without notice, and the first few notes pierce the air with startling clarity.</p>
        <p>''I'm my own walking demo tape,'' Ms. Giraud said. ''When I went to Columbia Records, I turned off the machine and just started singing.''</p>
        <p>The company was impressed. ''The music is one of a kind,'' said Steve Ramirez, a Columbia artists' representative. ''I think it has real commercial viability.''</p>
        <p>Other rappers have mixed pieces of operatic arias into their songs, but Ms. Giraud is distinctive in that she wants to create an entirely new musical genre. ''It's a fusion that's never been done before,'' she said, ''and it's two forms of music that I love the most.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Giraud said most people ''think opera and hip-hop are like night and day.''</p>
        <p>''But they aren't,'' she added. ''They are so similar. They were just composed in two entirely different time frames.''</p>
        <p>Many opera composers, she noted, ''wrote about everything tragic in the world, about bloodshed, death, intrigue, murder, incest, revenge.'' Rap music, she continued, ''is the same thing, but we're talking about the ghetto, we're talking about living on the street, being a drug dealer, your mother's on crack, your girlfriend just lost a baby.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Giraud, who has sung opera at Carnegie Hall, collaborated with well-known producers, like Fran Lover and Spider, on ''Hip-Hopera,'' a 10-song album she hopes to release. On the song ''Desperation,'' she performs a duet with R.I.N. of the rap group Klockerz Crew.</p>
        <p>''We took a Vivaldi song, 'Sposa son disprezzata,' and paired it with hip-hop lyrics,'' Ms. Giraud explained. ''I'm singing the actual Italian aria, but we build a hip-hop beat around it. Then R.I.N. comes in, rhyming about much the same things I'm singing about, about the lost love of my husband. Only in ghetto fashion.''</p>
        <p>Opera, Ms. Giraud believes, holds great promise for urban youth. So what about a hip-hop/opera performance for young people at Lincoln Center? ''That would be fabulous,'' she said.</p>
