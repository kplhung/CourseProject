        <p>Not all the dancing at the Metropolitan Opera House these days is by American Ballet Theater. Another performance of note occurs every evening, if the weather is clear, at approximately seven minutes to curtain outside the Met. And it's free.</p>
        <p>The performance begins with the sound of the chimes that warn ballet and opera patrons to take their seats quickly. A small, rotund dog named Baura, caramel colored and of no particular breed, is quietly curled up at her owner's feet. Hearing the chimes, she lifts her head, cocks her ears and rises.</p>
        <p>Her hindquarters sway. Her tail wags madly, though in truth it takes only an affectionate look to get it going. Her head turns, pale-lashed eyes scrutinizing the center door where soon, she knows, she will have a moment's concert all her own.</p>
        <p>Lois Binetsky, the Met ticket-taker who has been ringing the chimes for nearly two decades, steps out the door and serenades the dancing Baura.</p>
        <p>''Dogs do that when they're happy,'' Ms. Binetsky said one recent night. ''It's not just the tail. They wiggle everything.''</p>
        <p>Baura, who lives with her owner, Gilda Rivera, on the Upper West Side, has been coming to hear the Met chimes for seven years. Ms. Rivera discovered Baura's musical bent accidentally, on one of the three daily walks she and Baura take around the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>A small, ageless woman of few words but a ready smile and twinkling eyes, Ms. Rivera acquired Baura from her daughter in Florida. The dog has lived with her for about 12 years.</p>
        <p>''She never wanted to marry,'' Ms. Rivera explained of her pet.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rivera generally comes a little early and sits on the stone wall on the south side of the plaza. An eagle-eyed people watcher, she has detected a certain similarity between the curving backs of Baura and Ethan Stiefel, a dashing Ballet Theater star portrayed on a nearby poster.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rivera has never been inside the Met. Neither has Baura. ''No dogs inside,'' Ms. Rivera said sadly. ''No cats, no pigeons, no nothing.''</p>
        <p>People stream into the theater, some coming over to greet and pat Baura. Those in the know stay to watch her dance.</p>
        <p>Is it a good ballet? Ms. Rivera asked. Yes, a visitor replied. ''That's why she likes it,'' Ms. Rivera said, looking down at her pet fondly.</p>
        <p>Baura has many fans, Ms. Binetsky chief among them.</p>
        <p>''I love dogs, and this one has such a sweet face,'' Ms. Binetsky said. ''So pretty, so soulful, with beautiful hound-dog eyes.''</p>
        <p>Playing the chimes for Baura, Ms. Binetsky has become fond of Ms. Rivera, too.</p>
        <p>''I like to see her,'' she said. ''I always tell her when I'm not coming.''</p>
