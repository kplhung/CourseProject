        <p>On her 40th birthday, Juli Inkster's talent remained one of her greatest gifts.</p>
        <p>Showing the desire and ability that have won her five major titles, Inkster stole the spotlight today with a brilliant third-round 65 at the McDonald's Ladies Professional Golf Association Championship.</p>
        <p>It was the low round of the day. It was the low round of the tournament. And while Inkster did not mind acknowledging another birthday, it was obvious that the defending champion also wants to win another major.</p>
        <p>Moving to seven under par for the tournament (206), and setting up an intriguing Sunday finale, Inkster was tied for the lead with Wendy Ward after the third round at DuPont Country Club. Ward, who is trying to win her first major, shot her third consecutive round in the 60's (68) and will start the final round even with Inkster. Jan Stephenson was two strokes off the lead in third place at five under par after today's 69, while Nancy Scranton, who shot 67, was alone in fourth place at four under par.</p>
        <p>With 11 players sitting at two under par or better, the final round will begin with many potential winners. But Inkster will have a chance to become the first back-to-back winner at the McDonald's since Patty Sheehan, who won in 1983 and 1984. And today, while being serenaded by fans wishing her happy birthday throughout her round, Inkster's game looked as good as it ever has.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there was one person that didn't know it was my birthday,'' said Inkster, who had seven birdies and one bogey and who missed only one green in regulation. ''Everyone around the greens was saying, 'Happy birthday.' When you're over par, it doesn't sound very good. When you're six under, it's O.K.</p>
        <p>''I did what I wanted to do: got myself back in the ballgame. Who knows what tomorrow will bring, but I'm there. If I can go out and play another strong round, I have a good shot.''</p>
        <p>It will take a strong round to win, because errant shots at this tournament can be costly, particularly those that land in the rough. Ask Laura Davies, who began the day with a two-stroke lead over Ward. Davies struggled to a 75 and tumbled into a tie for seventh place at two under par, a round that may cost her the tournament.</p>
        <p>But Inkster and Ward were steady. Inkster birdied seven of her last 12 holes, a charge that was reminiscent of last year's final round, when she finished eagle, birdie, birdie for a come-from-behind victory. That victory completed the career Grand Slam for Inkster, a Hall of Fame player who became only the fourth woman to win all four L.P.G.A. majors, joining Pat Bradley, Louise Suggs and Mickey Wright.</p>
        <p>Today, Inkster proved she had plenty left. Ward had a three-stroke lead after she birdied No. 11 to reach seven under par. But playing several groups ahead of Ward, Inkster ended her day with three consecutive birdies, including a 35-foot birdie putt at No. 18 that tied Ward and sent Inkster into the clubhouse with a smile.</p>
        <p>''We expect Juli to do things like that,'' said Ward, who has two career victories. ''She's probably one of about two or three players on tour that I really look up to.''</p>
        <p>But Ward will attempt to beat Inkster on Sunday, playing the kind of golf that has earned her a share of the lead. Paired with Davies in today's final group, Ward handled the pressure and put together a stretch of four consecutive birdies that started on No. 8. Ward made three birdie putts from 18 feet during that stretch, showing composure that could come in handy Sunday, when she plays in the final group of a major for the first time.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Stephenson, at age 48, will be trying to win her first tournament since 1987. After a shaky start, making three bogeys during her first six holes, Stephenson regrouped and was three under par over her final eight holes.</p>
        <p>''A win would mean everything for me,'' said Stephenson, who sustained a serious hand injury in 1990, when she was mugged in Miami. ''To prove people wrong who said I can't come back, that said I can't change my golf swing at my age.''</p>
        <p>For Inkster and Stephenson, age is just a number that is not as important as their ability. Both will have a chance to win Sunday. And when it was mentioned to Inkster that she was not over the hill, she was ready with a response.</p>
        <p>''I'm at the top of the hill,'' Inkster said. ''It's a long plateau.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>KARRIE WEBB, trying to win her third consecutive major, was five strokes off the lead, tied at two under par with PAT BRADLEY, SE RI PAK, WENDY DOOLAN and LAURA DAVIES.</p>
