      <abstract>
        <p>Thomas L Anderson letter responds to June 18 front-page article on young people's reluctance to take summer jobs; contends his own liberal arts college education would have been incomplete without blue-collar education he got working summers</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It would indeed be good if all of our children could be free from the need to work when they should be concentrating on their academic and social development (front page, June 18), but those who would eliminate summer work for our most privileged young people do them a disservice.</p>
        <p>During my recent college years, I spent summers working in a warehouse for a bottled-water company. While I considered it mind-numbing and often complained that it was ''below my station,'' in retrospect I realize that my formal instruction in the humanities and social sciences would have been incomplete without my brief blue-collar education.</p>

        <p>Perhaps the only way a student like Sean Stevens, the Georgetown University junior quoted in your article, can fully understand the human problems his education is preparing him to tackle is to experience manual labor, tense workplace race relations and subsistence pay firsthand.</p>
