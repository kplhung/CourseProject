        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Two basic standards in journalism were ignored in the story on the Bedford schools' budget battles.</p>
        <p>Unfounded allegations of bigotry were published without a source or evidence. Secondly, no one, myself included, who opposed the $65.7 million budget was contacted.</p>
        <p>Being very much in the middle of all this, I can assure readers that anti-Hispanic bigotry and ''class division'' never entered the picture.</p>
        <p>Is it possible to understand that reasonable people can object to a $65.7 million dollar budget that involves $4.9 million in new, additional property taxes? We are already at least 25 percent higher in our per-pupil costs than similar districts and 45 percent higher than the New York State average.</p>
        <p>Financial mismanagement and shortsighted planning is par for the course in Bedford Central. For the last two years it has overspent its approved budgets by 2 percent or $1 million. Last summer, $1.5 million in UNUM Health Insurance Company stock appeared out of nowhere in the business office; $750,000 in alleged savings in health insurance turned into a $750,000 deficit.</p>
        <p>Regarding teacher salaries, I purchased a full-page advertisement in Bedford's Record-Review listing three years of W-2 wages for the top 300 district employees. Everyone understands a W-2. It tells the real compensation story.</p>
        <p>PHILIP CHRISTE  Mount Kisco</p>
        <p>Editor's note: The basic Bedford school budget passed by a vote of 2,742 to 2,093 last Tuesday.</p>
