        <p>Brooklyn's Zab Judah made a successful first defense of his International Boxing Federation junior-welterweight championship tonight with a unanimous decision over Junior Witter on the undercard of the Mike Tyson-Lou Savarese fight in Glasgow's Hampden Park.</p>
        <p>It was an awkward fight for Judah, who improved to 23-0 as Witter rarely engaged in an extended exchange of punches. Witter also kept switching between fighting right-handed and left-handed, which also helped make him an elusive opponent. By the middle rounds, however, Judah's consistent body punching slowed Witter, and with 30 seconds left in the fifth round, Judah caught Witter with a straight left hand that dazed Witter and sent his mouthpiece skittering across the ring.</p>

        <p>Witter (15-1-2), from Bradford, England, was a late replacement for Jason Roland, who withdrew from the fight two weeks ago because of medical reasons.</p>
