        <p>WHEN it came to his health, Jim Wenzell had to admit, he was a typical man.</p>
        <p>A pilot for Southwest Airlines, he started having trouble dragging his luggage across airports. ''I'd get short of breath, have a little pain in my chest,'' he said. Mr. Wenzell, who is 51, thought he knew what the problem was: ''I thought I was out of shape.''</p>
        <p>He had his annual physical exam -- required by the airline -- and found out otherwise. His problem was two almost completely blocked coronary arteries. It was quite a surprise. He had no family history of heart disease, he said, and no risk factors.</p>
        <p>Well, maybe one. His cholesterol level, when last tested a decade ago, had been an alarmingly high 275, 75 points above the safe level. He thought he had taken care of it with a crash low-fat diet. But eventually he returned to his old ways, eating whatever he wanted, and never had his cholesterol rechecked. When he recently learned that his arteries were blocked, his doctor informed him that his cholesterol had soared to 290.</p>
        <p>Federal rules required Mr. Wenzell to take an exercise stress test. He knew he would never pass. He had had one artery opened with angioplasty, but the other remained fully blocked and required bypass surgery.</p>
        <p>So did he see a surgeon right away? No way. ''I thought I'd exercise myself out of it,'' he said. That, of course, did not work, as his doctor had warned him.</p>
        <p>Finally, he ended up in the office of Dr. Robert E. Michler, the chief of cardiothoracic surgery and transplantation at Ohio State University Medical Center in Columbus. Dr. Michler was dismayed but not surprised by Mr. Wenzell's attempts to take his serious medical problems into his own hands. Men, he says, are like that.</p>
        <p>''It's a denial response, a proactive response,'' Dr. Michler said. ''It's their body, and they know how to adjust their body.'' Instead, he explained, they end up on the operating table -- or worse.</p>
        <p>It is a cliche, of course, that men are tough deniers of illness, while women seek medical help and advice for the slightest twinge. There are thousands of exceptions, and doctors say behavior varies from culture to culture.</p>
        <p>Still, stereotypes are often rooted in reality. When a group of male doctors was recently asked to talk about patients who had taken control of their own medical care, with distressing results, the stories they told were invariably about men.</p>
        <p>''Health is a macho thing,'' said Dr. I. Kelman Cohen, a plastic surgeon at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond.  ''Men don't like to be out of control. So they deny their symptomology.''</p>
        <p>While talking not long ago with a male doctor who happened to be a cancer specialist, Dr. Cohen said, he noticed that the man had a skin cancer and urged him to make an appointment to have it removed. Two days later, Dr. Cohen said, the man called back. ''It's gone,'' he said.</p>
        <p>What he meant, Dr. Cohen added, was that ''the little scab on the top was gone.'' Of course, the cancer specialist knew that -- he knew all about cancer, but he was not about to admit it. Only after enormous effort was Dr. Cohen able to persuade him to have the necessary surgery.</p>
        <p>Dr. Richard Schubert, an internist in private practice in Washington, told of a male patient in his 50's with ''absolutely outrageous cholesterol, around 400.'' Dr. Schubert urged him to take a statin, one of a stunningly effective class of drugs that can make cholesterol levels plummet. What did the patient do? ''He takes the medication for six weeks and doesn't renew it,'' Dr. Schubert said. ''He never comes in for a follow-up.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Schubert worried that the man might pay an enormous price for his cavalier behavior. His father had died of a heart attack, making it much more likely that the man would have a heart attack, too -- possibly a fatal one. So, in utter frustration, Dr. Schubert called his patient at his office to have a word with him. ''He hasn't returned my call,'' Dr. Schubert said.</p>
        <p>Many men, he explained, simply do not like being told what to do. ''The idea of someone else controlling your life is very difficult,'' he said. ''A doctor sitting behind a desk, wagging a finger -- that puts them back to almost an infantile stage. They rebel.''</p>
        <p>Male doctors say they understand the impulse. And -- no surprise -- the most macho patients of all are the surgeons.</p>
        <p>''As surgeons, we're control freaks,'' Dr. Cohen, the plastic surgeon, said. ''We're the worst patients. We don't want to talk about illness.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Michler, the heart surgeon, noted: ''It gets to the heart of this whole male concept of manliness and virility and the ability not to cry for help. They are out there playing.'' If athletes can play through injuries, men reason, ''What's a little heart disease?'' Dr. Michler said.</p>
        <p>Of course, he added ruefully, ''I'm afraid that I probably do the same thing.''</p>
