        <p>As part of the recent renovation of City Hall Park, the fountain in the center has been rebuilt, gas lanterns have been installed and an iron fence has been erected around the perimeter.</p>
        <p>Now, another change is in the works.</p>
        <p>The city's Department of Transportation wants to remove a subway entrance on the Manhattan side of the Brooklyn Bridge walkway, just a few steps from City Hall. A department spokesman did not give a reason for the proposed change and could not say when it would be done.</p>
        <p>The bridge walkway, which is shared by bicyclists and pedestrians, is 16 feet wide at most points. But at the entrance to half a dozen subway trains, the passage narrows to four feet.</p>
        <p>The Brooklyn borough president,  Howard Golden, wants the entrance to remain. In a letter to Lawrence G. Reuter, president of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Mr. Golden noted that many pedestrians who pass over the bridge use the entrance to cross beneath Centre Street, protecting themselves from the weather and at the same time easing congestion on nearby sidewalks. Removing the entrance, he added, ''would impose a serious burden on the displaced pedestrian users.''</p>
        <p>Members of Transportation Alternatives, a cyclists' advocacy group, disagree. While the entrance may benefit the estimated 800 people who use it each day, the group says, it is an obstacle for the 6,000 others who must squeeze through the narrow stretch of walkway daily.</p>
        <p>''It's in the public interest to get rid of a choke point where pedestrians and bicyclists run into one another,'' said the group's president, John Kaehny.</p>
        <p>Actual cyclists and pedestrians, a steady flow of whom pass the spot each day, had their own opinions on the matter. Emmanuel Rivers, a carpenter from East Flatbush, halted as he approached the narrow section of the walkway on his bike, then passed through on foot. He said he supported broadening the walkway by doing away with the entrance.</p>
        <p>''You could easily wipe out at that spot,'' he said. ''If you're coming down the bridge on a bicycle and someone comes up the stairs and jumps in front of you, you'd knock them right back down into the subway before you could brake.''</p>
        <p>During rush hour, crowding is especially severe. Pedestrians and cyclists edge past one another gingerly as they inch through the narrow passageway. Occasionally, heavy foot and bicycle traffic cause bottlenecks.</p>
        <p>Mark Reed, a film editor from Park Slope who was heading to Manhattan by bike, said he had witnessed a few near-collisions there. ''Every time you get to that section,'' he said, ''it feels like an accident waiting to happen.''</p>
