        <p>TOWARD the end of August Wilson's ''Jitney,'' at the Second Stage Theater Off Broadway, the drivers and other denizens of Becker's Car Service return to their storefront office after a funeral. As they enter one by one, you realize you have come to know these characters so well that you feel you have shared the loss with them, as though you, too, are a member of the mourning party.</p>
        <p>Even before that final scene, the indelible performances of the nine cast members in ''Jitney'' have made their characters so familiar that you may believe you have lived in Pittsburgh's Hill District all your life and that your own family has used Becker's for years, to be ferried to the grocery store, washeteria or visits to relatives.</p>
        <p>You know that if Turnbo shows up, he's going to grumble about being kept waiting and start gossiping; if Fielding gets the call, he's going to try to cadge a dollar extra for a pint of whiskey; if it's Youngblood, he's going to complain about carrying anything in his pristine trunk; if it's Doub or Becker himself, you're going to get a little chit-chat with the ride. You know that Shealy runs the numbers game and that Philmore is the doorman at the hotel. You wonder whether Youngblood will finally be tamed by Rena and whether they will ever get married, now that their boy is 2 years old. And you will probably know all about Booster, Becker's son, who is due to get out of prison soon.</p>
        <p>This sense of familiarity begins, of course, with the richly poetic language of Mr. Wilson, a two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright whose Broadway hits include ''Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,''  ''Fences,''  ''Joe Turner's Come and Gone,''  ''Two Trains Running'' and ''Seven Guitars.'' But while ''Jitney'' is very funny in the idiosyncrasies of its characters, it is also a poignant evocation of the aspirations of the late 1970's that cuts across color lines, but that happens to be told from an African-American perspective. That it is so full of hope against so much disappointment reflects the indomitable spirit of all Americans whether, as one actor in the cast put it, ''black, white or green.''</p>
        <p>On the surface, the play deals with the social and economic troubles of the time through the impending forced closing of the car service business, which will put the drivers out of jobs. But as with all meaningful plays, ''Jitney'' operates on deeper levels as well. There is the theme of forgiveness in the release of Becker's son from prison, the sense of wasted lives and compromised dignity in the stories of the older drivers and the dreams for the future through the stormy relationship between Youngblood and Rena. In the end, it is a play about the meaning of love.</p>
        <p>Just as composers must rely on musicians to convey the emotional force of their music, playwrights depend on actors to bring their characters to life. And the actors in Marion McClinton's staging of ''Jitney'' are pitch-perfect.</p>
        <p>The comparisons to music are not idle. In a recent conversation with the nine-member cast at the theater, more than one spoke of their performances and the play in musical terms, as did Mr. McClinton. If the actors are the playwright's musicians, the director is the conductor. And in casting the play, the quality Mr. McClinton said he looked for first was the actor's ability to make the extra effort to be an ensemble player rather than just another virtuosic soloist.</p>
        <p>''You can tell in auditions whether an actor is an ensemble actor,'' Mr. McClinton said in a telephone interview from his home in St. Louis. ''Often at an audition it's simply: 'Look at me! Look at me!' But when there's give and take between actors, you know you have a team player.''</p>
        <p>''Hearing 'Jitney' is like listening to the Modern Jazz Quartet,'' Mr. McClinton added. ''Each of the characters has his or her solo, but they've also got to be there as backup for the others.''</p>
        <p>For Barry Shabaka Henley, who plays Doub, a middle-aged driver, each performance ''is like a jam session.''</p>
        <p>Y OU come in with your own instrument every night,'' he said, ''and you've got to be ready to jump in and play as hard as you can. You get juiced up and feed off each other's riffs. You just can't wait to get out there and play.''</p>
        <p>The references to soloists and sidemen are especially apt for ''Jitney.'' Each of the characters has a monologue that helps define his or her persona. For Willis Burks II, who plays the numbers runner Shealy, it's a hilarious story about a jinx a woman has put on his love life; for Anthony Chisholm, who is the alcoholic driver Fielding, it's a rueful tale about once being a tailor for Billy Eckstein; for Paul Butler's Becker, it's an account of his wife's death; and for Mr. Henley's Doub, it's about his service in the Korean War, stacking dead bodies: ''Six high -- not five, not seven. But always six high.'' It's a gripping speech, splendidly delivered by Mr. Henley.</p>
        <p>But it is brought home to the audience with even greater force by the attention with which Russell Hornsby, who plays Youngblood, a Vietnam veteran himself, listens to it.</p>
        <p>One of the first lessons in Acting 101 is that you have to listen to the actor who is speaking (instead of, say, trying to remember your own next line or listening for your cue or trying to steal a scene by distracting attention from the speaker). It is a lesson some actors learn better than others. Few do it as well as the nine actors in ''Jitney,'' whose entire cast was cited for its work with an Obie award.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hornsby listens a lot in ''Jitney.'' It is Youngblood, for example, to whom the story of Becker's son's crime is related. Mr. Hornsby must hear the tale eight times a week with a growing amazement and anger that will transfer to the audience almost by osmosis.</p>
        <p>''What makes all this work for me is the fellowship we have with each other,'' Mr. Hornsby said. ''We're truly engaged onstage because we're engaged in real life. I ask a question out there and listen because I want to know.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burks agreed: ''It's something really quite extraordinary we have here. It lets you go out there and hear each moment for the first time every night.''</p>
        <p>Michole Briana White, who plays Youngblood's independent-minded girlfriend, Rena, said she had been astonished at ''the amount of professionalism in the cast'' from the first reading of the play. ''Ensemble work is not about ego,'' she said. ''It's all about moving the story forward. Everybody puts ego aside in this group.''</p>
        <p>Another advantage of having a cast that has been working together for so long is the split-second accuracy of timing and blocking with which the action moves. Each actor knows where the others are going to be onstage and at what tempo each scene will develop.</p>
        <p>''It's like the Chicago Bulls during their championship years,'' Mr. Chisholm said. ''It's like you are dribbling down court full speed and pass the ball behind your back without looking and you know somebody's there to take it and dunk it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Henley interjected: ''That was the Harlem Globetrotters.'' Mr. Chisholm shot back: ''The Bulls did it, too.''</p>
        <p>Certainly the metaphor is apt. In several scenes, especially one toward the end in which an argument develops over a $10 contribution for funeral flowers, the entire cast moves with the precision of a fast break in basketball or the intricacy of a timing pass pattern in football.</p>
        <p>ANOTHER mark of the cast's distinction is the way the actors build their characters through small personal traits -- a slight tremor in Mr. Chisholm's hand or the way he fumbles with the cap on a half-pint of whiskey; how Mr. Butler uses a fedora to create Becker's aura of respectability; the way Mr. Burks and Mr. Hornsby consult the small notebooks in which each keeps the figures that define their success in life. It is through such specificity that the audience comes to know them.</p>
        <p>Describing the cast's closeness, Leo V. Finnie III, who plays the doorman Philmore, said: ''About 45 minutes before the show every night, we all get together and talk about what we've been doing. 'What was your day like?'  'What's been going on?' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Henley added: ''I love every member of this cast. Oh, we may argue from time to time, but it's like family arguing. Some nights we all hold hands before we go on.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chisholm, who has appeared in four of Mr. Wilson's plays, said: ''In all of August's plays something happens that puts you in a different kind of place. But in this one, with this cast, there is an intangible cohesiveness you don't find in the others.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McClinton, the director, also spoke of the ''intangible element'' that has evolved in this production. ''It's not something you can direct,'' he said. ''It doesn't often happen with a cast. And with this one it's developed over the long period of time they've been doing it.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, one of the reasons behind the success of this staging of ''Jitney'' is the length of time many in the cast have been performing it. It has long been Mr. Wilson's habit that his plays tour the country in various regional theaters while he polishes them with rewrites before they land in New York.</p>
        <p>''Jitney,'' which was the first play Mr. Wilson wrote in his cycle dealing with the African-American experience in each decade of the 20th century, was originally produced in 1979 in his native Pittsburgh. The present version, for which the author made revisions, was first staged in 1996 for the Pittsburgh Public Theater, and four of the nine current cast members have been with it since its inception. But it has not been a straight path to New York. Along the way it has played in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Washington and Los Angeles, among other cities.</p>
        <p>Stephen McKinley Henderson, who plays Turnbo, said that some of the actors had made sacrifices to stay with the play. ''We wouldn't know where it was going next,'' he said. ''The Pittsburgh production was supposed to be it. But just as we were winding up, somebody else said they wanted to do it. We'd do that one, and then another theater would want it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burks said that some of the actors would take other jobs in between productions. ''I worked on a couple of movies, but I would always be available for the next time someone wanted to do it.''</p>
        <p>The dedication of the actors to the play had been there from the beginning, Mr. Butler said: ''It evolved from the very first reading. It was like we all looked at each other and said, 'We gotta go! We gotta go!' ''</p>
        <p>The initial enthusiasm has been infectious for those who have joined the cast since. Carl Lumbly, who plays Becker's son, Booster, is the newest member. ''I just feel gratitude for being part of this group,'' he said. ''To be with a cast that is committed to meeting and then topping the bar every time.''</p>
        <p>The length of time in a role can have its drawbacks. Actors can get tired of a character and end up delivering perfunctory readings while walking through the part. In theater it's called ''mailing in a performance.'' This has not happened in ''Jitney.''</p>
        <p>''The play itself is so exciting,'' Mr. Hornsby said. ''I look forward to doing it every night. It's an emotional thing for everybody.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Henderson agreed that the play was the main reason. ''We've all sort of made a mission out of this,'' he said. ''Because of August. And also because at some point you begin to realize that you're delivering something that's important.''</p>
        <p>Ms. White said another factor was that the cast keeps working on their characters. ''After every performance, Russell and I talk about how our scene worked that night,'' she said, referring to a confrontation she and Mr. Hornsby have in which Ms. White delivers a virtual manifesto on behalf of black women. ''We discuss the performance and ask ourselves how we can improve it. Do I need to listen more? Should I put my foot down more? You can't play the same notes every night. That's what keeps it alive and fresh.''</p>
        <p>Every season that includes a new August Wilson play is a reminder of the vast mine of talent among black actors in this country that one rarely gets to see onstage.</p>
        <p>Have opportunities increased over recent years for black actors? Has the movement known as nontraditional casting -- using minority and female actors in roles written for white males -- made any difference?</p>
        <p>''It goes in cycles,'' Mr. Henley said. ''I think there were even more black shows in the 70's than there are now. Black actors are a reflection of black workers in other fields. When it's convenient for us to be seen, we'll be seen. If Hollywood sees there's no danger of losing money on a black project, then they'll do it. When 'Waiting to Exhale' did well, everybody thought, 'Finally, a black movie made money, now we'll finally see more.' But it doesn't happen. The trend goes back and forth.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chisholm said he saw more opportunities for African-American actors on television than the stage: ''Today, because there are more television channels, there are more chances to get something done -- a miniseries or some project like that. But as far as the theater is concerned, the chances are few and far between. Sometimes you have to wait for years.''</p>
        <p>Regional theaters, Mr. Henderson said, ''are good for this.''</p>
        <p>''There is a lot of theater between L.A. and New York,'' he noted. ''Actors get work because of these companies. We need more of them so we can have ensembles. Because, you know, for actors, there are no unimportant roles.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chisholm agreed. ''I'm an actor. I can play a lizard, anything. I've worked in 'nontraditional' theater. I did 'Of Mice and Men.' Played Slim. The great Joe Fields did a Willy Loman. We as actors want to act. But first of all, I'm an African-American. And putting all politics aside, what we need is more producers, more writers and, as a people, more cohesiveness. We as black people have got to support the theater. If people all came to see 'Jitney,' it would run for 10 years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Henderson, who is on the faculty of the State University of New York, Buffalo, said: ''It depends on what you mean by 'nontraditional' and 'traditional.' I've had people say to me: 'You're a good actor. You should be doing Shakespeare or Shaw.' I'm all for black actors doing those roles. But don't tell me playing those roles has to be the goal of my career. This is a big country and it is all of our stories that make it great. People should listen to all the stories. If you don't get 'Joe Turner's Come and Gone' or are uncomfortable about it, still go out and see it.''</p>
        <p>MR. HENLEY said that one of the reasons ''Jitney'' is ''so special is the thread of universality in it that makes it more accessible to white people.'' Some of Mr. Wilson's plays ''agitate a white audience,'' Mr. Henley said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chisholm, who appeared in ''Two Trains Running,'' compared the audiences that came to that play and those at ''Jitney.''  ''You get a very different feeling from the audiences for 'Jitney,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>For Ms. White: ''This play is so moving. Although it is set in the 1970's, it still applies to women today. I can totally relate to Rena. She was ahead of her time. For her to have the kind of courage she does -- to say 'I love myself first' -- she was taking a big risk.''</p>
        <p>One reason for the wide appeal of ''Jitney'' is the undercurrent of hope and forgiveness that flows through the play, often even unstated, as when two antagonists who have a bitter running feud resume playing checkers in the final scene.</p>
        <p>''This play really reflects its time for black Americans,'' Mr. Lumbly said. ''It's the 70's. Vietnam is over and we black people thought stuff was finally going to happen for us. Our dreams were on fire. And then nothing happened. We saw our dreams start to wither. This was also true for black actors.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lumbly recalled that when he and Mr. Butler made the movie ''To Sleep With Anger,'' a 1990 black drama in which they also played father and son, ''Somebody wrote that we were 'underknown' actors. But that implies that stardom is what I should be striving for. I don't agree with that. As black actors, we should be concentrating simply on becoming better artists.''</p>
        <p>One thing is certain. The cast members of ''Jitney'' are having the time of their lives acting in it. ''We're all so excited about this play,'' Mr. Burks said wistfully, ''that I sometimes wish I could just sit in the audience and watch us.''</p>
