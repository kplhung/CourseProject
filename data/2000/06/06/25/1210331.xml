        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission, in deciding to investigate whether Representative Rick A. Lazio violated insider trading laws, acted on the basis of information that suggested -- but hardly proved -- that he might have known about a pending takeover that had not been disclosed to the public.</p>
        <p>Most of the information that prompted the investigation was on the public record for two years before the S.E.C. acted, but it was evidently not put together by anyone until Mr. Lazio, a Republican, began running for the United States Senate from New York. Aides to Mr. Lazio said last week that he had received a request for information from the S.E.C. staff early in the week.</p>
        <p>The details, in brief, are that when Mr. Lazio made what seems to have been his first purchase of stock options ever -- securities that essentially represent a bet that a stock will rise significantly in a short period of time -- the company he bought the options on was actively, but confidentially, looking for another company to buy it out.</p>
        <p>To S.E.C. investigators, that in itself would arouse suspicion. A first-time options buyer who gets lucky enough to profit from a takeover typically draws questions from the S.E.C. on whether the trader might have had a relationship with an insider privy to confidential information.</p>
        <p>In this case, a relationship did exist. Top executives of the company, the Quick &amp; Reilly brokerage firm, were major contributors to Mr. Lazio's campaigns. Some of them were also executives of the Securities Industry Association, which actively lobbies the House Subcommittee on Finance, on which Mr. Lazio serves, because it has jurisdiction over many issues directly affecting the brokerage business.</p>
        <p>Securities lawyers say that combination -- unusual trading considering an investor's history and a connection to people with inside information about an unannounced takeover -- would prompt an investigation by the S.E.C. in virtually any case of which it became aware.</p>
        <p>But the relatively meager profits earned by Mr. Lazio -- $21,509 altogether, including his investments in other Quick &amp; Reilly securities --  meant that his trading was unlikely to have been noticed by the S.E.C. in its normal market monitoring, which relies heavily on the stock and options exchanges for leads.</p>
        <p>The Quick &amp; Reilly transaction, moreover, seems not to have generated a large amount of suspicious trading in advance, making it unlikely that either the Chicago Board Options Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange, the primary markets for Quick &amp; Reilly options and shares, respectively, would have referred any suspicious trading to the S.E.C.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio disclosed most, but not all, of his trades in Quick &amp; Reilly securities in a filing with Congress in the spring of 1998. Disclosure of the additional trades, which was made after reporters for The New York Times concluded that the original trading records could not have been complete, did not appear to raise any new questions about Mr. Lazio's trading activity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio and officials of Quick &amp; Reilly vigorously deny that he was given any inside information. If the S.E.C. finds no evidence that he was, the inquiry will be dropped. That is what happens in many such investigations.</p>
        <p>But the S.E.C. staff has more investigative options than simply asking Mr. Lazio and the Quick &amp; Reilly people if he received inside information. If the commissioners authorize subpoenas, the staff can search phone records or interview anyone who might have made other similarly timed investments in the firm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's first trade in Quick &amp; Reilly securities came on Feb. 11, 1997, when he bought 300 shares for $11,665. Simultaneously, in a trade he did not disclose on his Congressional report but did disclose this month, he sold options that gave the buyer the right to buy those shares for a price slightly above what Mr. Lazio paid.</p>
        <p>Together, those transactions represented a very conservative strategy that meant that if the stock did rise Mr. Lazio would earn a small profit. If it fell, however, the $392 he got for selling the options would cushion the loss.</p>
        <p>As it happened, the stock price rose only briefly, after Quick &amp; Reilly announced the stock split, and then declined. The options expired without being exercised, and Mr. Lazio was left with 450 shares of stock after the split took effect.</p>
        <p>On June 24, he bought another 50 shares of stock, paying $1,217. That left his average cost per share for the 500 shares he then owned at about $25. Including the commission he would have to pay, he would have  to get a price of about $25.50 per share to break even. But the stock never got that high until July 31.</p>
        <p>The next day, Friday, Aug. 1, with the stock price rising on above-normal volume, and activity in the options markets up as well, Mr. Lazio could have sold his stake and made a small profit. Instead, he bought options that allowed him to buy 1,200 more shares, at a price of $30, any time until Oct. 17. On the following Monday, he bought options on 600 more shares in a trade that was not disclosed on his Congressional filing.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 11, word leaked to Bloomberg News that the company had hired investment bankers to seek buyers, and the stock price soared. Mr. Lazio waited a few weeks to cash in his options, and sold his shares the following January, shortly before Fleet Financial completed its acquisition of Quick &amp; Reilly.</p>
        <p>He earned a profit of $13,643, or nearly 600 percent, on the August options purchases, and a profit of $7,866 on his other trades in Quick &amp; Reilly securities. Overall, his profit came to 142 percent of the $15,183 he invested.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has said he bought the options as a takeover speculation, on the advice of someone he has declined to name. A review of databases found no report in any newspaper or investment wire about such speculation before he bought the options on Aug. 1, although Dow Jones News Service carried a report a few hours after he made his options investment.</p>
        <p>But rising volume in options did indicate that speculation was growing by the time he made his investment.</p>
        <p>Buying options on the basis of a rumor is legal, unless the buyer has learned from an insider that the rumor is true. But insider trading cases have been prosecuted when people with confidential information about a coming takeover simply advised others that it was not a good time to sell.</p>
        <p>For the S.E.C., an independent agency that normally conducts its investigation with little public attention until it files charges, the Lazio case is already proving to be a difficult one. Although the investigation had begun before the agency received a request for an inquiry from H. Carl McCall, the New York State comptroller, Mr. McCall's letter helped to create a political tone.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCall, an ally of Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Lazio's Senate opponent, sent the request on his own campaign stationery. Mr. Lazio was quick to denounce the S.E.C. inquiry as politically motivated.</p>
        <p>As a result, the S.E.C. is under considerable pressure to complete its inquiry before the November election.</p>
