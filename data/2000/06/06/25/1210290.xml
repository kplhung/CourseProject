        <p>RESTAURANTS have taken to grilling food over wood in a big way -- all year long -- but the home cook usually waits until June, when the outdoor grill is wheeled out of the garage. At this time of year, I can hardly think of cooking any other way.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite dinners is a butterflied leg of lamb, served with young leaves of mint, which are especially fragrant at the beginning of summer. Sometimes I serve the lamb quite simply, on a bed of mint leaves, along with potatoes that have also been cooked on the grill. But it is also delicious served on orzo that has been tossed with shredded mint.</p>

        <p>RESTAURANTS have taken to grilling food over wood in a big way -- all year long -- but the home cook usually waits until June, when the outdoor grill is wheeled out of the garage. At this time of year, I can hardly think of cooking any other way.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite dinners is a butterflied leg of lamb, served with young leaves of mint, which are especially fragrant at the beginning of summer. Sometimes I serve the lamb quite simply, on a bed of mint leaves, along with potatoes that have also been cooked on the grill. But it is also delicious served on orzo that has been tossed with shredded mint.</p>
        <p>The meal begins with asparagus, which takes well to grilling since it caramelizes slightly over coals. It is good topped with ricotta salata or Parmesan shavings, and can also be served with bresaola or prosciutto.</p>
        <p>Apricots are now in their all-too-short season. So dessert is an apricot tart flavored with vanilla bean and amaretto and served at room temperature with creme fraiche or vanilla ice cream. A glass of chilled Barsac would be the perfect complement.</p>
        <p>Grilled Asparagus With Ricotta Salata</p>
        <p>Total time: 45 minutes  2 pounds asparagus</p>
        <p>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil  Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  Juice of half a lemon</p>
        <p>1/4 pound ricotta salata.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the grill. Cut off the tough ends of the asparagus and peel the spears. Cook them in salted boiling water for a minute. Drain, spread out on a platter and cool to room temperature.</p>
        <p>2. Brush the asparagus with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill for five to six minutes, turning frequently.</p>
        <p>3. Arrange the asparagus on a serving platter, season with additional oil, lemon juice and pepper. Shave the ricotta salata over the asparagus and serve.  Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Butterflied Leg of Lamb With Mint and Orzo  Total time: overnight marinating, 20 minutes cooking</p>
        <p>1 5-to-6-pound leg of lamb, boned so it lies flat</p>
        <p>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil  4 cloves garlic, minced  2 tablespoons Dijon mustard  2 tablespoons rosemary leaves  Coarse sea salt  1 pound orzo  Freshly ground pepper to taste  1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter  2 cups fresh mint leaves, shredded  Sprigs of mint to garnish.</p>
        <p>1. The previous evening, or a couple of hours before cooking the lamb, wipe it dry with paper towels and remove as much of the fat as possible. Combine the olive oil, garlic, mustard and rosemary leaves and spread the mixture evenly over the lamb. If you are marinating it overnight, wrap it in foil; otherwise, leave it at room temperature.</p>
        <p>2. Preheat the grill or coals until they are very hot. Bring six quarts of salted water to boil for the orzo. Season the lamb with salt and pepper. Put it on a grilling rack and cook seven to eight minutes on each side for rare. Cook it longer -- about 12 minutes -- for medium. If you cook it too much longer, it will be dry. While the lamb is grilling, cook the orzo, drain it and toss it with butter and mint. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>3. Let the lamb rest for five minutes, then cut it in thin slices with a sharp knife. Mound the orzo on a serving platter and arrange the slices of lamb on top. Garnish with sprigs of mint and serve.  Yield: 8 to 10 servings.</p>
        <p>Apricot Tart  Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>1 inch-long vanilla bean  2 cups water  4 tablespoons sugar  2 pounds firm, ripe apricots</p>
        <p>1/2 cup amaretto, kirsch or apricot brandy  1 8-inch pastry shell, fully baked  Creme fraiche or vanilla ice cream.</p>
        <p>1. Cut the vanilla bean in half horizontally and scrape out the pulp from the pod. Combine the water, sugar and vanilla bean pod and cook 15 minutes over moderate heat.</p>
        <p>2. Cut the apricots in half and remove the pits. Put them gently into the syrup and simmer them until almost tender (about 30 minutes). Remove them with a slotted spoon and put them on a plate. Leave a couple of apricot slices in the syrup.</p>
        <p>3. Add the amaretto to the syrup and continue to simmer until you have a thick glaze (about 15 to 20 minutes), mashing the remaining apricot halves with a spoon until they are amalgamated into the glaze.</p>
        <p>4. Just before serving, brush the pastry with the glaze. Arrange the apricot halves on the shell, face down. Brush with the remaining glaze and serve with creme fraiche or vanilla ice cream.  Yield: 8 servings.</p>
