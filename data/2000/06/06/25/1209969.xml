Participants also have to take three flights on partner carriers, stay three nights in partner hotels and rent a car for five days from a partner car-rental company. All of this must be done by July 1. There are also intermediate awards of 500,000 and 100,000 miles.</p>

        <p>INTENTIONALLY or not, airline frequent-flier programs have moved the target for mileage trophy hunters: it's now a million free miles. One of the latest examples is courtesy of LatinPass, a frequent-flier consortium representing 10 Latin American airlines.</p>
        <p>In January, LatinPass offered a million-mile bonus to anyone flying at least one international leg on each of nine of its members: Aces, Aeropostal, Avianca, Copa Airlines, Aviateca, Lacsa, Nica, Taca and Taca Peru. (Saeta, an Ecuadorean airline that is also a LatinPass carrier, cannot fly internationally and is not in the million-mile bonus program.) Participants also have to take three flights on partner carriers, stay three nights in partner hotels and rent a car for five days from a partner car-rental company. All of this must be done by July 1. There are also intermediate awards of 500,000 and 100,000 miles.</p>
        <p>Those requirements may seem restrictive, but on March 20, LatinPass officials shut off enrollment in the bonus plan. Guy Booth, program director for LatinPass, estimated earlier this month that more than 50 pass holders would probably qualify for the million-mile bonus, with a similar number earning 500,000 miles.</p>
        <p>It wasn't envisioned as such a popular program, Mr. Booth said, but LatinPass officials apparently failed to grasp the reach of the Internet.</p>
        <p>''We initially promoted it in a newsletter to our frequent fliers, but our good friend Randy Petersen got hold of it and posted it on his Web site,'' he said, referring to www.flyertalk.com, Mr. Petersen's chat room for frequent-flier fanatics. Mr. Petersen also publishes InsideFlyer magazine, designed to help frequent fliers make each mile go as far as possible. ''It did catch us a little bit by surprise in not knowing these Web sites existed and that the mileage hunters were out there,'' Mr. Booth said.</p>
        <p>Word was also spread by the beneficiary of another mileage-bonus promotion, David Phillips, a civil engineer from Davis, Calif., known as Pudding Guy. He earned the nickname (and 1.25 million miles on four carriers) in a promotion that offered miles in exchange for buying Healthy Choice foods. Mr. Phillips determined that by buying some $3,400 worth of products, mostly pudding cups, he could redeem the lids for 1.25 million miles. He says he has already used part of his bonus to take his family on a trip to Europe. Amid the news media attention that seems to be another bonus accompanying such feats nowadays, Mr. Phillips said that he had also qualified for the LatinPass million miles.</p>
        <p>Depending on how a million miles in the LatinPass program are redeemed, Mr. Booth said, the bonus could wind up costing the program's operators anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000.</p>
        <p>The LatinPass airlines are among the leaders in the region, although not as large  as major European and American carriers. The carriers joined forces to form LatinPass in 1995 for extra leverage. ''On their own, it's difficult for them to have a frequent-flier participation program with a major hotel chain or credit-card company,'' Mr. Booth said.</p>
