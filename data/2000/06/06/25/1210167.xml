        <p>When you think Florsheim, do you think new-age alternative healing?</p>
        <p>Men have long turned to the Florsheim Group's flagship brand for sturdy traditional dress shoes. The line has grown to include casual and golf shoes, and the company has done its share of innovating over the years, ''but we don't get credit for it,'' said Karen A. McKenzie, the company's director of marketing. ''Consumers just think black wingtips.''</p>
        <p>So a few eyebrows went up when Florsheim said it would introduce three dress styles with built-in magnetic insoles ''to promote circulation, promote healing and relieve pain.''</p>
        <p>The Magneforce insole got its start last year in the company's golf shoes -- ''Golfers will try anything to improve their game,'' Ms. McKenzie said -- and 70,000 pairs were sold in the first 12 months. Satisfied customers started asking for street shoes with magnets in them, and a light went on at Florsheim headquarters in Chicago. Magnetic dress styles will reach stores by early August, ''business casual'' by next February.</p>
        <p>The company said it was careful to stay within government guidelines when making health claims for the shoes and for magnetic therapy in general, which the government has yet to recognize as having any value. And Florsheim knows some customers are dubious: it already receives ''you have to be kidding'' and ''how dare you'' letters about the magnets.</p>
        <p>Even Ms. McKenzie was skeptical at first. ''When I joined the company a year ago, I thought this was the biggest bunch of baloney,'' she said. But she was won over, she said, by unsolicited testimonials from golfers and by academic studies that found beneficial effects of magnets.</p>
        <p>The magnetic insole is a thin, flexible sheet whose field, emanating from its edges, can penetrate two inches, the company said. But it is not strong enough to make paper clips cling to the shoe ''unless you cut it open and expose the magnet,'' Ms. McKenzie said. ''And don't worry, they won't make you stick to escalators or set off the metal detector at the airport. We checked.''</p>
