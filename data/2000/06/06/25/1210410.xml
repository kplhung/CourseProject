        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Summer Work Is Out of Favor With the Young'' (front page, June 18): My first job, which I had for four summers 30 years ago, was counselor at a camp for boys run by the Catholic Diocese of Springfield, Mass. We had middle-class children, but about one-third of our campers were sponsored.  Often, they were sent to get away from something at home. I vividly remember holding an 8-year-old who cried every night because he didn't want his parents to get divorced.</p>
        <p>I also remember working Saturdays at the Barneys parking lot. I met many characters who helped me understand what living in New York City is all about. I also got a discount on the clothes I needed for my ''professional'' job at a big bank.</p>

        <p>Most important, I developed great respect for my Puerto Rican co-workers, who brought me lunch, introduced me to their wives and children and taught me a little Spanish. I'm sure glad we didn't have computer camps back then.</p>
