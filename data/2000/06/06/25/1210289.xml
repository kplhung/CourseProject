        <p>He is right. I may be the only person in or near the Motor City who deliberately doesn't have a car or driver's license. Invariably, people say, ''But a car gives you so much freedom!''</p>

        <p>Re ''Americans Aren't in the Market for Freedom'' (On the Contrary, June 4), in which Daniel Akst said people should spend less time buying things and more time deciding what to achieve with their money:</p>
        <p>He is right. I may be the only person in or near the Motor City who deliberately doesn't have a car or driver's license. Invariably, people say, ''But a car gives you so much freedom!''</p>
        <p>My reply: ''No, a car give you the illusion of freedom; real freedom is money.'' I can take a cheap trip to Europe just on what I save on insurance. And I have more to invest toward the future, when they'll have to give up driving.</p>
