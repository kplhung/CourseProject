        <p>LONG ISLAND businesses are aiming recruitment drives at their youngest audiences ever, seeking fresh-faced schoolchildren to help plug the gaping hole in the local workforce.</p>
        <p>Besides fattening their employment ranks with a more immediate supply from colleges and universities, businesses are cementing partnerships with educators at the earliest grades, even helping to write next year's curriculum in some school districts.</p>
        <p>With the unemployment rate a startlingly low 2.5 percent, business groups are hoping to prime students to be more eager to take jobs on the Island when they reach employment age. By promoting work right after high school graduation, the companies are suggesting a break on the traditional on a high-school-to-college career path.</p>
        <p>''What we're talking about is not just developing students who would be going onto college,'' said Anthony Singe, schools superintendent in the Locust Valley Central School District. ''We're really talking about developing a larger pool of students who would pursue jobs after high school.''</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, business executives have been shadowing educators and school administrators to observe and share strategies under a program sponsored by the Long Island Works Coalition.</p>
        <p>In the next leg of the program, called Leadership Exchange for Achievement Through Partnership, or LEAP, school personnel will follow business managers on the job next month. Fast-food restaurants, factories and technology companies are among the businesses taking part.</p>
        <p>The program has touched off criticism that students would shun college for a quick leap into the working world (though actual employment under the program will come only after the current work with teachers and school administrators).</p>
        <p>And Herman Berliner, provost and dean of faculties at Hofstra University, warned that entering the workforce before college could backfire if the strong economy moderates. ''In preparing for the future, not just the next three months or six months, college is still a very smart investment,'' he said, ''and very timely in terms of what someone should do after high school.''</p>
        <p>But Candee Swenson, president of the Suffolk County School Superintendents Association and superintendent of the Longwood Central School District, which is in the program, said, ''People are absolutely able to benefit from and enjoy a variety of professions with or without college as an immediate adjunct to high school.''</p>
        <p>Francis Roberts, education professor and director of school-university partnerships at the Long Island University C. W. Post campus, said the program could also bring into the labor market high school dropouts who might otherwise languish.</p>
        <p>The stepped-up effort to bolster the workforce has its origins in part in the strong forecasts for the Island's economic health, even as indicators point to a slowing national economy.</p>
        <p>Last month the national unemployment rate edged up to 4.1 percent, wage increases eased and chinks emerged in the Internet economy. But Irwin Kellner, a Hofstra economics professor, said a shakeout among dot-com companies could help ease the shortage of workers on the Island.</p>
        <p>''The unemployment rate is so low that the demise of the dot-com companies becomes not a negative but a positive,'' he said, ''because it frees up lots of young, fairly skilled individuals to go back to work in some of the longstanding brick-and-mortar, old-economy type companies, or even just routine technology companies.''</p>
        <p>Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist at the Long Island Association, the area's largest business group, still cautioned that the benefits could be short-lived as surviving Internet companies gain strength.</p>
        <p>''I think the dot-com shakeout may give us some breathing room to train and educate the labor force we need for the dot-com industry,'' she said, ''but I don't think the breathing room will last very long. The shakeout will end and the industry will grow rapidly again, and if we don't have workers ready for them, Long Island will suffer. We have to act today to train the workers.''</p>
        <p>The visits to schools by business managers have forged what educators said were some long overdue links between the education and corporate sectors. In addition to promoting the sharing of technology and other resources, the exchanges are leading to agreements to revise curriculums so that business takes a place alongside traditional skills.</p>
        <p>Educators and businesses also plan to bring students into the equation with internships and other projects aimed at promoting jobs as visibly as the college literature and posters that adorn school hallways.</p>
        <p>''If you go to three teen-agers on a street and ask them to name three companies on Long Island, many of them would not be able to do that,'' said Sue Gubing, the school-industry coordinator at the Smithtown Central School District. ''Students could name five colleges because we have posters and college catalogs all over the building. Corporations, if they want to reach and attract students, need to provide us with posters and annual reports and other career-related information.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Gubing said more students were beginning to recognize businesses because students are shown a video, ''Long Island: Your Future is Here,'' by the Long Island Association, and because of the Internet. Educators have made a greater effort to direct students to the home pages of Island businesses, she said.</p>
        <p>By early fall, Smithtown educators will meet with representatives of Computer Associates to review ''curriculum enrichments, so when a teacher is talking about a topic in class she can say, 'This is how you're going to use it someday in the workplace,' '' Ms. Gubing said.</p>
        <p>Smithtown students will also report for Computer Associates' in-house newsletter, and the district may dispatch guidance counselors to the company to advise employees about how their children should apply to colleges.</p>
        <p>For Computer Associates, the exchange signals a new ''targeted approach'' to the earlier grades, said Jayne Mayer, the company's executive director of community relations.</p>
        <p>''There's a limited amount of talent, and a lot of companies are all going to be after the same kids,'' she said. ''Part of this is a recruiting tool. They're going to be familiar with Computer Associates and hopefully they'll be interested in joining our workforce.''</p>
        <p>John Loonam, a project director of LEAP and a manager in the Bethpage office of Northrop Grumman's Logicon information services division, said he was less concerned about recruiting employees than about retaining them.</p>
        <p>Technology employees tend to seek work elsewhere if they sense their companies lag in technical innovation, Mr. Loonam said, so his exchange, with the Freeport Union Free School District, will emphasize technology: Logicon will help the district adopt videoconferencing, and Freeport students will research communication technology that Logicon might deploy itself.</p>
        <p>Educators said schools should emphasize technical savvy, not specific technology. ''It's not a matter of the platform you use,'' said Tony Ciaglia, assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction in Freeport. ''It's the ability to retrieve and manage information.''</p>
        <p>With that in mind, educators are focusing on work skills as much as content, slowly shifting the emphasis from individual studies to teamwork, for example.</p>
        <p>Dr. Singe, the Locust Valley superintendent, said his district would expand the concept by coordinating curriculums so two teachers in different classes collaborate on the same lesson plan. The district began the strategy last fall, with a science teacher imparting the practical applications of theory taught by a technology teacher in another class. Next fall the district will pair special education and mainstream teachers, and extend an advanced science program from the ninth grade, where students take on an original research project, to the middle school, Dr. Singe said.</p>
        <p>Barbara Jeffries, vice president at the Smithtown branch of an environmental engineering consulting firm, said a recent visit to the West Islip school district inspired her to begin a summer internship program and take on three college students who had graduated from local high schools.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jeffries, an engineer who grew up in Miami, said she was encouraged to start the internship program because of surprising similarities between the education and business worlds.</p>
        <p>She said she was moved when she witnessed school administrators admonish a student for making remarks to a teacher that could have been construed as sexual harassment.</p>
        <p>''At some point before I left, the teacher came in and made some comment to the dean, and I could see how hurt that teacher was,'' Ms. Jeffries said. ''It was a real microcosm of the workplace. Think about 15 years ago, when I was a young engineer, how difficult it was to work in an almost completely male-dominated profession.''</p>
