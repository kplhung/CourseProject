        <p>When William E. Kennard can't explain to his wife the complexities of their phone bill, it's time for the telephone companies to make their bills simpler.

        <p>The government estimates that the typical consumer spends about $69 a month on residential phone charges. Last year Bell Atlantic's New York subsidiary earned revenues of $8.3 billion from both New York customers and other sources, including payments from long-distance companies using Bell Atlantic's telephone lines, advertising revenue from Bell Atlantic's Yellow Pages and payments from the Universal Service Fund to help low-income customers and provide service in areas where telephones are not generally available. The chart at right shows what New Yorkers will be paying to Bell Atlantic (currently in the process of merging with GTE and becoming Verizon Communications) every month starting July 1 and what Bell Atlantic, according to government reports, does with all the money it gets.</p>
