        <p>Shakespeare's Language</p>
        <p>By Frank Kermode.</p>
        <p>324 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $30.</p>
        <p>A nyone looking to read Shakespeare intently must be prepared to negotiate two sizable forests. This is true not merely for the professional Shakespearean -- the teacher who has transformed the Bard into bread -- but also for the actor who occasionally lands a Shakespeare role, or for the professor whose specialty lies elsewhere but who regularly sneaks the odd Shakespeare play onto the syllabus, or for that noble lay reader who, stealing time from law or medicine or business, vows to march resolutely through ''The Complete Works.''</p>
        <p>The first of these forests consists of the mind of that unreckonable man who created ''Hamlet'' and ''Twelfth Night'' and ''The Tempest.'' This is someone about whom, for all the digging of scholars and historians over the centuries, very little is positively known (an ignorance encouraging a promiscuous array of speculations about his personal habits, sexual orientation, mental health and so forth). Chief among his many mysteries was his seeming indifference to publication -- in striking contrast to his contemporary Ben Jonson. Difficult as it is to compass the imagination that could have begotten ''The Tempest,'' it is more difficult still -- if not flat-out impossible -- to conceive of someone who, having written it, wouldn't fret over its preservation for the ages. One is left nodding approvingly at Jorge Luis Borges's wry notion that Shakespeare was someone who adopted ''the habit of feigning that he was somebody, so that his 'nobodiness' might not be discovered.''</p>
        <p>The second forest is composed of Shakespeare scholarship. It would be interesting to know at what precise point in history -- early in the 18th century, probably -- the sum of serious Shakespeare criticism exceeded the length of the oeuvre itself. But it would surely be nothing but dismaying to discover the ratio by which, in the year 2000, the criticism now beggars the body of work from which it springs.</p>
        <p>So we turn to a writer like Frank Kermode, who would be our guide through both of the Shakespearean forests. He is as qualified as any guide could be -- a distinguished British scholar who served as one of the editors of ''The Riverside Shakespeare'' -- and the result is a sane, canny, steadily informative book. ''Shakespeare's Language'' is rooted in an impatience with recent trends in Shakespeare criticism, which, in Kermode's view, has become so thematic or ideological as to ''have little time for his language.'' He adds, ''Every other aspect of Shakespeare is studied almost to death, but the fact that he was a poet has somehow dropped out of consideration.'' Kermode's method is specific and often minute: he proceeds largely through close readings of short, often gnarly passages. He is particularly adept at identifying those stylistic tricks and tics by which Shakespeare created a distinct tone -- a differentiated language -- from one play to the next.</p>
        <p>After a brief introduction and a general overview of Shakespeare's early career, we have chapters on 17 plays performed, almost without exception, at the Globe Theater, starting with ''Julius Caesar,'' a format that might suggest the book is in fact a collection of introductions -- and the reader could certainly treat it as a reference, to be pulled down from the shelf before launching into a play. But when read straight through, ''Shakespeare's Language'' reveals a pervading theme and a sense of aggregation: Kermode traces the line of rhetorical development from 1599-1600 and ''Hamlet,'' when Shakespeare ''moved up to a new level of achievement and difficulty,'' to the late plays. It's a progression away from the literary formulas of the lyric poem toward a richer, denser, more stageworthy language that offered, among its many liberations, a ''new way of representing turbulent thinking.'' In this view, Shakespeare's embrace of a new freedom of metaphor -- looser, less predictable chains of association -- in combination with a ''rougher handling'' of pentameter, ushered into the theater nothing less than a far more accurate technique for mapping the human mind.</p>
        <p>As our guide into the forest of Shakespeare criticism, Kermode proceeds sure-footedly, with an eye for the long view: he surveys a variable field of responses over the centuries, from Jonson to Johnson to Coleridge to Empson to a range of modern scholars. He also bends now and then to peer at some little verbal conundrum. Kermode is fully at home in these fine points of analysis -- the corrupt texts over which generations of scholars have labored in a continuing effort to arrive at what Shakespeare actually wrote. These textual issues are unusual in that they presuppose right and wrong answers (unlike so many of the discussion-generating questions of the classroom), and Kermode's pursuit of discoverable truths may account for his habit of respectful but often bluntly dismissive appraisal. (One colleague's interpretation of ''Titus Andronicus'' is ''surely as misguided as it is honorable.'' Another's suggestion that ''Hamlet'' contains an allusion -- a sort of buried advertisement -- to ''Julius Caesar'' is ''bright but unlikely.'') The result is a tone that is refreshingly free of hedging and qualification.</p>
        <p>When he enters the underbrush of Shakespeare's sensibility, Kermode shows himself far more circumspect. He avoids anything that might be called unwarranted speculation. Even so, a dense portrait emerges of an artist in midcareer who, while creating some of humankind's most harrowing artistic visions -- King Lear,'' ''Othello,'' ''Macbeth'' -- simultaneously exhibited an exultant, giddy, even gleeful pleasure in his own ramifying verbal powers.</p>
        <p>This self-delight, Kermode argues, clarifies one of the thorniest issues in Shakespeare studies: his obscurity. Many modern readers, I suspect, feel gently reproached by Shakespeare's difficulty and vaguely guilty about how reliant they are on marginal glosses to see them through the most opaque passages. We assume that a fall from grace has taken place -- from those Elizabethan audiences who, practiced at listening to extended oratory and fully at home with Shakespeare's cadences and vocabulary, could appreciate our language's greatest poet with a directness and purity we've lost. So it is comforting to hear Kermode say, point-blank, ''It is simply inconceivable that anybody at the Globe . . . could have followed every sentence of 'Coriolanus.' ''Again and again he reminds us that during his stylistic evolution Shakespeare was continually challenging -- training'' -- his audience to accept novel and perplexing modes of delivery and exposition.</p>
        <p>Kermode attributes Shakespeare's obscurity less to showing off or to exuberant carelessness than to a sort of headlong, self-regarding joy. We can picture Shakespeare pausing to refill his pen, observing to himself that he has just composed seven or eight lines that will baffle his audience, and concluding, ''But they're lovely and I shall keep them.''</p>
        <p>ARTISTS in all fields, and of all degrees of talent, instinctively seem to sympathize with the tour de force executed for its own sake. So Proust savored the image of an obscure Dutch painter's attempting ''a score of times'' to render a ''patch of yellow wall'' -- a background detail that few observers could be expected to notice, let alone appreciate. So the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein was cheered to read that the sculptors of the Statue of Liberty stinted no artistry in forging the crown of Liberty's head -- which no one would see.</p>
        <p>Or so the sculptors might have thought. For in the fullness of time all variety of private workmanship has a way of coming unexpectedly to light. The paintings of that once obscure Dutch artist Jan Vermeer today are projected upon classroom screens across the world, every scrupulously artful brick magnified and aglow. The Statue of Liberty is regularly glimpsed from above by aircraft undreamed of when the sculpture was executed. Likewise, those dense passages of Shakespeare -- seemingly doomed to exist only as bright, fleeting verbal dazzlers delivered from a rickety, flammable stage -- have been lovingly disassembled and scrutinized, word by word, by critics like Kermode, and recently spun through computer concordances and databases into lines of analysis unthinkable to the master who produced them.</p>
        <p>And where such analysis is sufficiently discerning and deferential and self-effacing, as it is in ''Shakespeare's Language,'' we're reminded that those two Shakespearean forests are one and the same wood. It's that enchanted place where maker and admirer together find ''books in the running brooks,'' and ''good in every thing.''</p>
