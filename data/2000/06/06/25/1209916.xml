        <p>NO GREAT MISCHIEF</p>
        <p>By Alistair MacLeod.</p>
        <p>283 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>W. W. Norton &amp; Company. $23.95.</p>
        <p>A MONTH ago, the fiction of Alistair MacLeod was entirely unknown to me. The 64-year-old Canadian writer has published just three books, and ''No Great Mischief,'' his only novel, is the first of them to be widely available in the United States. Having spent the last few weeks reading, in avid succession, volumes that his Canadian devotees have been given after long intervals of anticipation, I can report that MacLeod's world of Cape Breton -- with its Scottish fishermen and their displaced heirs, the miners and young professionals it has mournfully sent to the rest of the nation -- has become a permanent part of my own inner library.</p>
        <p>The great extended family or clan, its members forever battling among themselves and just as reliably uniting against outside foes, is these days more at home on television than in the pages of serious fiction. But in ''No Great Mischief,'' MacLeod's lyricism succeeds in leaving a reader both harrowed by and envious of all the sorrow, violence and ravenous love demanded by the MacDonald family bloodlines. The novel's narrator and contemporary focus -- an orthodontist named Alexander -- may seem at first a pale attenuation of his Cape Breton kin, but he lives in a tumult of memory and longing that eventually becomes the reader's own. Alexander's real commute is not the depressing, obligatory Saturday drive that he makes across Ontario to check on his alcoholic older brother, Calum; it is his ceaseless ride on the past-present shuttle of his creator's imagination.</p>
        <p>When the drink-damaged Calum looks out into the alley behind his shabby Toronto room, he doesn't see ''the erratic fire escapes and the resting garbage'' but rather a cliff in distant Cape Breton where the blackfish are jumping near the gravestone of his ancestor, Calum Ruadh. And it isn't the brandy that gives him the vision; it's the psychic pull of that great-great-great-grandfather, who set out from Scotland in 1779 at the age of 55; who lost his second wife on the voyage; whose dog swam out to the departing ship and insisted on making the journey; who lived a second 55 years on Cape Breton -- and whose songs have been sung in Gaelic to all his descendants.</p>
        <p>Much of MacLeod's novel is told in flashbacks (a beside-the-point term to any writer more interested in the past than the present) while Alexander goes to get beer for his brother. As he crosses the streets of Toronto, association and memory assemble a host of MacDonalds, including some of the clan's many other Alexanders, one of them the narrator's cousin, killed years before in a uranium mine: ''While I was going forth into a world of perfect teeth, his unanticipated death was waiting for him in a hole in the ground.''</p>
        <p>The life of the narrating Alexander has always been governed by sudden death and persistent ghosts. When he was a child, his parents and another older brother were drowned while walking across the frozen channel to the island where his father kept the lighthouse. As always, MacLeod spreads an unbearable calm over this calamity: ''Everyone could see their three dark forms and the smaller one of the dog outlined upon the whiteness over which they traveled. By the time they were halfway across, it was dusk and out there on the ice they lit their lanterns, and that too was seen from the shore. And then they continued on their way. Then the lanterns seemed to waver and almost to dance wildly, and one described an arc in what was now the darkness and then was still.''</p>
        <p>Young Alexander and his twin sister -- Sometimes they would refer to us as the 'lucky' children and sometimes as the 'unlucky' children'' -- are left to be raised by the older generation. Their two grandfathers are a study in contrasts, one as fastidious as the other is tippling and merry. The first prefers straight history to legend; the other always sees the MacDonald forebears in full cry and ''coming home in the sun.'' Alexander grows up less rough than his surviving older brothers, who sleep with loaded rifles under their beds and ''in the hot summer nights, after drinking beer . . . raise their upstairs windows and urinate down the outside clapboard walls.'' Still, just after finishing college, he doesn't hesitate to join them in the mines to finish the hitch of his namesake cousin. There the brothers also band together to aid a more distant young relative, yet another Alexander MacDonald, of San Francisco, who has fled to Canada to dodge the draft. It is this particular act of blood loyalty that sets up the book's final catastrophe.</p>
        <p>MacLeod's tenderness -- his sympathy for all these hard-drinking, lonely, wind-scattered island people -- extends even to the animals that live and die in their midst. His fiction regularly breaks the heart with knackered horses, beached whales, dogs martyred for faithfulness to a master. But there is no sentimental showmanship to what he does: the animals are trapped by the same whirling forces as the people. Beasts and humans share, and inflict on each other, some gruesome cruelties: a drowned fisherman in an early story called ''The Boat'' has his eyes pecked out by sea gulls; Calum MacDonald uses a horse and some fishing line to extract his own infected tooth. These grim incidents reflect a naturalism that is singularly natural, not the deterministic Grand Guignol typically indicated by this literary term. The title's words, ''No great mischief,'' were once scornfully applied by General Wolfe to the Highlanders fighting alongside him on the Plains of Abraham: ''No great mischief if they fall.'' In MacLeod's work, the phrase voices our great misapprehension about the significance of almost every creature that draws breath; the author would swear that, for all their apparent inconsequence, each one of them hovers over a small diaspora of others.</p>
        <p>MacLeod is too thoroughly at home in the short story to make his late-career transition to novel writing without some stumbles. The MacDonalds' history, unfolded by the telling and retelling of famous deeds, often seems more like an episodic saga than a novel. In the attempt to convey truths of thought and emotion, ''No Great Mischief'' is also oddly more explicit than MacLeod's short fiction. A story has so much less time to accomplish its thematic work that the temptation to deploy an italicized moral is usually greater than in the more capacious novel; yet MacLeod betrays a certain anxiety about the size of this new expanse he has to govern, and he winds up policing some of its pages with a needlessly heavy hand.</p>
        <p>There is a lot of underscoring: on the same page that Calum MacDonald quotes Robert Frost (''When you have to go there, they have to take you in''), the narrator notes how their draft-dodging kinsman wears ''a Celtic ring upon his finger. The never-ending circle.'' Most obtrusively, the narrator's sister has grown up into a spokeswoman instead of a character. Deracinated and wistful, living in a ''modernistic house in Calgary,'' she warns her brother: ''Perhaps you and I idealize our parents too much because we scarcely remember them. They are the 'idea' of parents rather than real people.'' She even seems aware of herself as a device: '' 'But, this is a long digression,' she sighed.''</p>
        <p>SHEER passion for what he wants to impart also plays a role in MacLeod's excesses. When the narrator tells us that his cousin Alexander's suspicious death -- killed by a bucket being lowered into the mine shaft -- reminds him of how Mac Ian of Glencoe was murdered near his bed in 1692 (''Propelled forward and downward by the unseen and unexpected force at the back of his head . . . his hair dyed forever brighter by the crimson of his blood''), we feel the author trying to will meaning into the connection, just as he seeks to give every MacDonald brawl perhaps more than its heroic due. Even so, the attempt feels more ennobling than effortful. One does well to keep in mind that a writer can only overemphasize his themes by first having any themes at all. MacLeod's are hugely bigger than the special pleadings that pass for argument in much contemporary fiction.</p>
        <p>He does not take readers to as many different places and psyches as his country's very best writer, Alice Munro, but he indelibly renders a Cape Breton we are never likely to visit -- a terrain where the ''dog days'' are the coldest, not the muggiest, and where the ocean wind has forced enough sand into the trees that ''when the saw passed through them in the early darkness of the fall and winter evenings, streaks of blue and orange flame shot from them.''</p>
        <p>In February, MacLeod's short stories will appear here in an omnibus volume called ''Island.'' With that book and ''No Great Mischief,'' American readers will have before them this writer's entire oeuvre, a new land that their imaginations can seize like a manifest destiny.</p>
        <p>Thomas Mallon's novels include ''Henry and Clara,'' ''Dewey Defeats Truman'' and, most recently, ''Two Moons.''</p>
