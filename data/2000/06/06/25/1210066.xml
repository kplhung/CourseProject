        <p>ONE woman, Wendy Kerner Lucas, is the principal harpist of the Norwalk and the Ridgefield symphonies, plays in two flute-harp duos and in a quartet specializing in traditional Irish music, runs a concert series for the New Canaan Public Library, co-directs summer training sessions for young musicians, teaches privately and serves as chairwoman of the American Harp Society's education committee.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lucas, who was born in Westport, now lives in New Canaan with her husband, Charles Lucas, a vice president at the Juilliard School who plans to retire at the end of the month. Recently Ms. Lucas took time out from that very full schedule for a conversation about her career in music.</p>
        <p>Q. Was there music in the house when you were growing up?</p>
        <p>A. Not really, but my family was involved with the graphic arts, and I guess that impulse to create rubbed off on me. At a very early age, I wanted to have my own artistic outlet, and when I was 6 I decided it should be the harp. I pestered my parents for a whole year until finally they gave in and rented a small instrument for me, and I gradually worked up from there. Emily Oppenheimer was my first teacher, at the Westport School of Music; later I began working with Susann McDonald, first privately, then at the Juilliard School, where I got my bachelor's and master's degrees.</p>
        <p>Q. You do a lot of solo and chamber music, but you're also an orchestral harpist. Do you prefer one to the other?</p>
        <p>A. No, I love them both. With chamber music it's a full collaboration, like a conversation with a friend. On the other hand, playing with a fine orchestra is extremely rewarding because of the wonderful repertory, and also the excitement of being part of a huge sound and in the midst of so many different colors.</p>
        <p>Yes, orchestral harpists do have to wait around a lot in certain pieces, but other big works, such as the Mahler Symphonies, keep us busy all the way through.</p>
        <p>Next season in Norwalk we'll be doing Bartok's ''Concerto for Orchestra'' and that one has fine parts for two harps. Sometimes, by the way, solo and orchestral come together: next February I'll be playing the Debussy ''Danses'' with the Ridgefield Symphony.</p>
        <p>Q. What instrument do you use?</p>
        <p>A. I have a couple of harps, but my best one is a Lyon &amp; Healy called Style 23, though that's something only another harpist would care about. There are a lot of different models, though, and the sound can vary a great deal from one to another.</p>
        <p>Also the age of the harp can be a factor: the frame shifts slightly as it grows older, so the pull on the strings feels different. Unlike violins, harps do have a limited life span. Mine is getting up there -- it's about 20 years old, I would guess -- but it ought to last through my life span.</p>
        <p>Q. Your winter concerts at the New Canaan Library, seem to have given birth to summer offspring. How did that come about?</p>
        <p>A. When we moved to New Canaan, I was asked by the Friends of the Library to produce their Sunday recitals, and that developed into a free series every January that we call Notes in Mid-Winter. I've tried to bring in top-notch artists and to present a wide diversity of musical styles -- last time our roster included the Borealis Wind Quintet, the prize-winning cellist Allison Eldredge and the Hot Cat Jazz Band -- and it seems to have worked.</p>
        <p>Audiences have been steadily growing, to the point that they now tend to overflow the room, which holds about 200 people. At every concert last January, a number of listeners had to sit out in the hallway.</p>
        <p>Q. You said these are free concerts, and yet you bring in major artists and ensembles. Who's paying for them?</p>
        <p>A. The Friends of the New Canaan Library raise money through book sales and contributions, so we are able to operate on a fully professional basis. We probably can't match the fees the performers get elsewhere, but because our audiences are so warm and responsive, artists enjoy playing there and want to return. Even though the hall wasn't really built for music, it has an intimate feel that works equally well for players and audience.</p>
        <p>Q. And now there will be Notes in Summer as well?</p>
        <p>A. Yes, we'll have our first ever free June concert on Thursday evening at 8. The winter programs were so successful that the Friends decided give the warm weather a try, and see how folks react. In fact, we hope to have the music outdoors: the building forms a sort of natural courtyard, so we'll set up some chairs, and people can bring blankets. If the weather doesn't cooperate, of course, we'll have to move back inside.</p>
        <p>Q. And the performers?</p>
        <p>A. Another first, actually, since we're presenting the superb Eastern Brass Quintet. I've shied away from brasses in January because those are matinee recitals, the Library is open, and I've always worried that it might be a bit unsettling for people to have trumpets blowing when they're trying to do some quiet studying. On Thursday, though, we start at 8, which is when the building officially closes.</p>
        <p>Q. You have an intriguing project next month too, don't you?</p>
        <p>A. Yes. I do a lot of private teaching, but for the last four summers, the flutist Angela Kelly and I have run a chamber music camp for flute and harp in Darien.</p>
        <p>It's quite something: we have players at various skill levels and all ages -- adults as well as kids -- who take individual lessons, attend seminars, and get the opportunity to perform in flute choirs, harp orchestras and mixed ensembles too.</p>
        <p>This year we'll have two sessions, July 10 through the 14, and Aug. 7 through 11, working from 10 to 4 each day.</p>
        <p>It's amazing what students can accomplish with that sort of intensive immersion, and on the last day of each session, they'll gave a free showcase recital at First Congregational Church.</p>
        <p>The free concerts on July 14 and Aug. 11 begin at 3 p.m. The number to call for more information is 203-655-0491.</p>
        <p>The Guilford-based Eastern Brass Quintet, founded almost 30 years ago, comprises the trumpeters Richard Green and Rich Clymer, the tubist Mirris Kainuma, the trombonist Gary Capetandes and the hornist Peter Reit. No tickets are needed for the free 8 p.m. Thursday program; directions to the New Canaan Library can be obtained by calling 203-801-2665.</p>
