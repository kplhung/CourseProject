        <p>L'ECOLE NO. 41 is a bustling little winery in Lowden, Wash., not far from Walla Walla. Their 1997 Columbia River Cabernet Sauvignon is a wine to put plenty of better-known California cabernets to shame. But they don't make much wine at L'Ecole No. 41 and unless you plan to be traveling in eastern Washington soon, you may have trouble finding it.</p>
        <p>You could ask them to send you a case,  but that would be unwise, at least without some advice from your lawyer. In most of  this country, you can buy just about anything by phone or over the Internet, from guns to pornography, and have it shipped to your home. Try it with wine, though, and you may be committing a felony.</p>
        <p>Since Prohibition ended 67 years ago, wine and spirits have made their way to consumers through the so-called three-tiered system -- intended to keep mobsters out of the booze business. Wineries must sell their products to a licensed wholesaler, who sells it to a licensed retailer. Producers may not own any part of the wholesalers, who may have no financial interest in retailers.</p>
        <p>Over the last 30 years, however, the number of American wineries has exploded, while the number of wholesalers has plummeted, squeezing all but the larger producers out of the distribution system. There are some 800 wineries in California alone, producing more than 4,000 different wines. But 500 of these producers are tiny, producing  perhaps 1 percent of all California wine. Nationally, just 49 wineries produce 90 percent of the domestic wine Americans drink.</p>
        <p>Most of the wines that are unavailable beyond the states in which they are made are expensive, but wine lovers, and there are a lot of them, don't want their choices dictated by a few distributors. ''The price doesn't bother me,'' said a New York stockbroker with an extensive wine cellar, ''it's the fact that I can't buy them here and I can't have them shipped to me.''</p>
        <p>Wholesalers, on the other hand, are terrified of direct shipment, which would enable anyone to surf the Web for interesting wines, and order them via credit card or phone. In fact, there is already a thriving direct shipment business for small case lots of wine.</p>
        <p>''What began as a cottage industry catering to collectors of hard-to-find wines has become a coast-to-coast $1-billion-a-year enterprise,'' an industry trade group, the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America, warned in a statement last year. The Wine Institute, the research and promotional arm of the wine producers, contends that the figure is closer to $350 million.</p>
        <p>Direct shipment ''in most states illegally bypasses laws requiring alcohol sellers to be licensed by the state,'' the wholesalers group said. ''It also avoids taxes and makes it easier for underage people to purchase alcohol.''</p>
        <p>To bring home the supposed danger to the nation's youth from mail-order wine, the industry staged events at which teenagers purchased wine and spirits over the phone or Internet. Direct shipment supporters promptly filled wine publications and Web sites with parodies depicting 14-year-olds guzzling illegally obtained  Mondavi Reserve Cabernet and Chateau Lafite-Rothschild in their basements.</p>
        <p>Underage drinking and tax collection are problems, said John DeLuca, president of the Wine Institute. But the ''loss of income from the direct sales'' was the wholesalers' real worry, he said.</p>
        <p>This would appear to be the case, since the wine distributors have said that they would support direct shipment, if wine sellers  ''clear'' their sales. Clear, in this case, means paying a commission to wholesalers and retailers for doing nothing. One start-up, called WineShopper.com, says that by using this system, it will supply ''thousands of wines'' directly to the consumer or to a retailer nearby.</p>
        <p>Both the wholesalers and the wineries claim the law for their side. The wholesalers and the states cite the 21st Amendment, which gives the states the right to regulate the liquor industry within their borders. The  wineries and consumer groups claim that to single out wine for special controls is discriminatory and a restraint of trade, violating the Interstate Commerce Clause, the Sherman Antitrust Act and even the First Amendment.</p>
        <p>FEDERAL district courts in Indiana and Texas have thrown out laws banning direct shipment -- both decisions are on appeal -- and similar suits are pending in half a dozen other states. In the meantime, according to the Wine Institute, 30 states allow some form of direct shipment. Thirteen of them reciprocate with other wine-producing states, some demand permits, some limit the amount of wine a consumer can buy, and 10 allow intrastate shipments only.</p>
        <p>Until this legal patchwork is sorted out by the courts, John S. Dyson, former New York State commissioner of agriculture and deputy mayor for finance and economic development under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, seems to have discovered the nearest thing to a solution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dyson was enamored of the wines of Williams Selyem, a small winery in Healdsburg, Calif., which sells all its famous pinot noirs to an exclusive mail order list. Soon after Williams Selyem told its customers that that law prevented it from shipping any more wine to New York, Mr. Dyson bought the winery for $9.5 million. He already owned Millbrook Vineyards in New York State, and as a vintner was entitled to ship wines from California with impunity.</p>
