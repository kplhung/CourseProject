        <p>TAKING a cue from the travel industry in the United States, European airlines and hotel companies have begun setting up their own Web sites, where customers can shop for flights and rooms.

        <p>In May, 11 European airlines -- led by British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France -- announced plans for a Web site where consumers can shop for fares and order tickets.

        <p>TAKING a cue from the travel industry in the United States, European airlines and hotel companies have begun setting up their own Web sites, where customers can shop for flights and rooms. And as in the United States, the action is angering travel agents who fear the sites will cut them off from some of the more tempting offerings.</p>
        <p>In May, 11 European airlines -- led by British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France -- announced plans for a Web site where consumers can shop for fares and order tickets. The site has yet to be named, but it will be managed by the McKinsey Consulting Group. The airlines -- which also include Alitalia, Austrian Airlines, British Midland, Finnair, Iberia of Spain, KLM of the Netherlands, Aer Lingus and Scandinavian Airlines Systems (SAS) -- hope to have it operational by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>At the same time, three of Europe's largest hotel groups, Hilton International and the Forte Hotel Group of Britain, and Accor of France, agreed to set up a similar Web site for hotel accommodations. The hotel site is also expected to be up by year's end.</p>
        <p>In the United States, a similar booking system called T2 was announced in January by Continental, Delta, Northwest and United Airlines, to allow consumers to shop for inexpensive air fares on participating airlines, and one day perhaps, on all others as well. The site, which has since been joined by at least 23 other airlines, is due to start up later this year.</p>
        <p>In Europe, as in North America, the goals of the airlines and hotels are twofold: first, to wean some customers from travel agents, who charge the airlines commissions. But more important, airline and hotel executives concede, they are trying to seize back the initiative from the array of Internet companies that offer inexpensive flights and hotel accommodations on the Web.</p>
        <p>''It was the clicks versus the bricks, unless we did something,'' said David Michels, chief executive of Hilton International. ''We have a right to sell our own product direct to the consumer.''</p>
        <p>Rod Eddington, chief executive of British Airways, said, ''All our research shows that customers want to be able to compare and buy offers from a wide range of airlines by visiting just one site.''</p>
        <p>Hilton executives say the plan is not aimed against travel agents and that they will continue to use agents. Instead, they say, it is aimed at middlemen, often working through Web sites, who buy up low-fare plane tickets or vacant hotel rooms and pass them on to the customer, usually pocketing a thin margin. And indeed, travel agents themselves will be able to use the hotel site, Hilton says.</p>
        <p>As in the United States, the plans by the airlines and hotels are also a reaction to a wave of startup online travel agencies. The Boston Consulting Group, which is managing the airlines' Web site in the United States, estimates that total online travel transactions in Europe was about $930 million last year.</p>
        <p>That is less than 1 percent of the $116.3 billion Europeans spent on travel, but growth at British-based companies like ebookers.com and lastminute.com, as well as dozens of other sites in Europe, has been dramatic. From 1998 to 1999, European online travel booking, though admittedly starting at very low levels, grew 280 percent.</p>
        <p>Yet the travel agents, who are far better organized than the online companies, have reacted strongly. In the United States, the American Society of Travel Agents has asked the Justice Department to decide whether the plans by the American and European airlines violate antitrust laws.</p>
        <p>Organizations of travel agents in several European countries, including Britain, Spain and Germany, want to take similar action in Europe. In May, the two largest Spanish organizations representing travel agencies wrote to the chairman of the Spanish carrier Iberia, which supports the European airline plan, threatening to appeal to antitrust regulators, and accusing the airlines of ''not trying to improve sales or customer service, but to begin operating themselves as travel agencies.''</p>
        <p>Keith Betton, director of corporate affairs at the Association of British Travel Agents, said travel agent organizations throughout the 15-nation European Union were considering an appeal to antitrust regulators. ''Obviously, airlines and others are perfectly free to set up Web sites, but they mustn't be anticompetitive,'' he said. ''We would be very upset if there were offers online which were not available to travel agents.''</p>
        <p>Still, it appears unlikely that the pressure on the traditional travel agents will diminish any time soon. Some European airlines, including Lufthansa and Finnair, already enable customers using cell phones with limited access to the Internet to check for flight delays or to change reservations. Within two to three years, they expect customers to be able to use their phones to book flights and buy tickets.</p>
        <p>Brendan Moran, chief executive of the Irish Travel Agents Association, recently described the use of the Web for reservations as just another form of distribution to which travel agents would have to adapt. To remain competitive, he said, travel agents would have to stress other kinds of services, like providing advice and information.</p>
