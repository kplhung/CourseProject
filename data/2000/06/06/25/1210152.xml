        <p>There are no incompletes for school admininstrators whose budgets were defeated last month. Voters in the Bedford, Elmsford, Harrison, Tuckahoe and Valhalla districts approved the 2000-01 budgets that were presented for another vote. Since Elmsford's first budget of $16.2 million had been defeated by only one vote, the district proposed the same budget earlier this month. It passed, 250 to 175. In Bedford, the $65.3 million basic budget passed 2,742 to 2,093, as did the $488,500 supplemental budget, 2,630 to 2,171. Tuckahoe voters adopted the $14.4 million budget, 606 to 537. Harrison voters, by 2,190 to 1,784, supported the $56.6 million budget, reduced by about $1.6 million. And in Valhalla, voters, by 920 to 899, approved a $20.6 million budget, which had been cut by $543,341.</p>
