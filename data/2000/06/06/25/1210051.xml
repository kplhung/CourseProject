        <p>WHEN the elegant marble lobby and mosaic-tiled corridors are restored in an $8 million renovation that is to be completed next month, the Riviera apartment house will be the fourth of five onetime luxury high-rises on what was once one of this city's most prestigious streets to be rehabilitated in the last six years.</p>
        <p>It will join the Emersonian, the Esplanade and Temple Gardens, all of which have been refurbished in recent years. The reconstruction has included replacing the floors of rabbit-warren-like apartments to create more spacious units that are closer to the buildings' original layouts.</p>
        <p>The Riviera's developers have set market-rate rents for its apartments, seeking affluent tenants for the inner-city location by emphasizing such things as a new entrance to the building from a fenced and gated parking lot and the equipping of all apartments with a T-1 high-speed Internet connection.</p>
        <p>Traditionally a city of two- and three-story homes, Baltimore built few large  apartment houses before World War II, but these four buildings on Druid Park Lake Drive overlooking the city's main park and its reservoir were the finest of their kind from 1912 to the early 1960's. Now after 35 years of decline, they are again desirable places to live.</p>
        <p>The six-story 92,000-square-foot Riviera was built in 1914. It was vacant when it was foreclosed on by the Housing and Urban Development Department in the mid-1990's. The building was acquired by the Baltimore City Department of Housing and Community Development, which issued a request for proposals for its reuse.</p>
        <p>In 1998, the team of Pennrose Properties,  a development firm from Philadelphia, and Reservoir Hill Hope, a local nonprofit developer, won the right to rehabilitate the Riviera. The project was the first in Baltimore for Pennrose, a company that has developed  more than 5,000 units of multifamily housing, including many historic properties, in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and Washington.</p>
        <p>Renovations in the 1960's and 1970's had cut the apartments into a warren of tiny units for subsidized housing, totally obliterating most of the original apartment layouts. One of the few things left from the 1914 design was a six-story-spiral fire escape slide, discovered behind a wall during demolition.</p>
        <p>The Riviera originally had eight apartments per floor. It now has nine units per floor: seven two-bedrooms of 1,200 to 1,600 square feet, and two one-bedrooms of about 700 square feet. All 54 units have either open porches or enclosed sun rooms with views of the park or downtown Baltimore.</p>
        <p>To redesign the apartments, the building had to be almost gutted. But because it was a Baltimore City landmark and eligible for state and federal tax credit equity for its historic status, many elements were retained. The lobby, with walls of marble and a coffered plaster ceiling, and the mosaic-tiled corridor floors with their original plaster cove moldings were all integrated into the new design, along with new lighting.</p>
        <p>As an additional condition for historic tax credit status, four apartments facing the park on the sixth floor and one apartment each on floors one through five, a total of nine units, had to retain or duplicate original interior detailing, like window trim, parquet flooring and baseboards. The brick and stone Classical Revival exterior along with its sheet metal cornice were restored.</p>
        <p>The Riviera's market-rate apartments are intended for professionals who work in the city. Rents will be $560 to $800 for the two-bedrooms and $600 for the one-bedrooms.</p>
        <p>The building is two miles northwest of the Inner Harbor, the city's hottest rental market, where rents start at $800 for a one-bedroom and $1,200 for two.</p>
        <p>''The Riviera will have all the amenities of a high-scale building,'' said Mark Dambly, vice president and a partner of Pennrose. ''There'll be a business center in the basement that offers Internet access, fax and copying machines, as well as a fitness center.'' A new entrance at the rear of the building will lead to a gated parking lot.</p>
        <p>A completely market-rate building tailored for professionals in this location is  unusual. The building abuts Reservoir Hill, a once affluent neighborhood of elegant town houses that has been in decline since the early 1960's. Some in the neighborhood are pleased that the units are not subsidized. ''This is a sign that says that this community is worth investing in,'' said Curtis Jones, the board president of Reservoir Hill Hope and pastor of nearby Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church.</p>
        <p>Aside from the developer's own equity and the historic tax credits, Pennrose received $5 million in loans from HUD and Baltimore City.</p>
        <p>By the early 1990's, the Emersonian, the Esplanade and Temple Gardens had suffered the same fate as the Riviera. When the State of Maryland decided to package all of them in a request for proposals in 1994, the Emersonian and the Esplanade were in such rundown condition that the remaining tenants had to be moved to Temple Gardens.</p>
        <p>Roizman Development of Plymouth Meeting, Pa., and the Baltimore Housing Partnership won the contract and called the project Renaissance Plaza. Since the three buildings made up the Eutaw-Madison Apartment House National Register District, they were eligible for historic tax credit equity.</p>
        <p>LIKE the Riviera, each building had interior features, like distinctive lobbies and corridors, to preserve. ''Besides restoring the exteriors, we established historic zones to be preserved,'' said Patricia Massey, who was project manager and director of the Baltimore Housing Partnership and who now runs her own firm, Katia Development.</p>
        <p>The oldest of the three, the nine-story Esplanade, built in 1912, was the first to be completed in 1994. Temple Gardens, at 14 stories the tallest building in Baltimore when it was built in 1926, came next in 1995.</p>
        <p>The last to be finished, in 1996, was the Emersonian, an eight-story building constructed in 1915 by Issac Emerson, the  creator of Bromo-Seltzer.</p>
        <p>With 84 of the 301 apartments at market-rate rents and the rest either subsidized or with income restrictions, the three buildings have had a 99 percent occupancy rate. The entire cost of Renaissance Plaza was $20 million.</p>
        <p>The fifth apartment house, at 903 Druid Park Lake Drive -- adjacent to the Riviera -- is vacant. It is on the market for $525,000.</p>
        <p>Until the early 1900's, Baltimore's wealthy lived in town houses in the center city or in suburban villas at its outskirts. Apartment living was considered lower class until the first luxury apartment house was built on Eutaw Place, an elite residential district. Once the rich adopted this life style, other apartment buildings were erected, notably at Druid Park Lake Drive, which intersects the entry to Eutaw Place.</p>
        <p>Still, high-rise apartment living (six stories or more by Baltimore's definition) had limited appeal, and fewer than two dozen were built before World War II. ''A lot of people said these buildings should be demolished, but we re-established that living along the lake was a glamorous thing,'' Ms. Massey said.</p>
