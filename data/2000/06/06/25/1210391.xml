        <p>While many state and federal officials and investigators wring their hands and wonder what to do about surging gas prices, Gov. Frank O'Bannon of Indiana has acted.</p>
        <p>Last week, using an emergency provision in Indiana law, Mr. O'Bannon, a Democrat, suspended the state's gas tax for two months, a move that will cut up to 10 cents off the price of a gallon of gasoline, now well over $2 in many places in Indiana and elsewhere in the Midwest.</p>
        <p>''Hoosiers can't afford to wait on federal and state investigators to tell us why the Midwest is being hit so hard,'' Mr. O'Bannon said.</p>
        <p>At the pump, many motorists roundly applauded the governor.</p>
        <p>But some Republican officials and legislators saw politics, not just dollar signs, in Mr. O'Bannon's move, noting that he is up for re-election and that he chose to announce the tax suspension against the photogenic backdrop of a busy Indianapolis gas station. They argued that the cut would unbalance the state budget and save the average motorist less than $2 per tank at the pump.</p>
        <p>''It's politics, a political year,'' said Senator Lawrence Borst of Greenwood, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.</p>
        <p>The governor's campaign manager, Tom New, had a one word response for that: ''Phooey.''</p>
