      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Meera Syal's smart, sprightly second novel, LIFE ISN'T ALL HA HA HEE HEE (New Press, $22.95), begins with an Indian wedding procession down a snowy London street. Dowdy Chila is marrying the dashing and worldly bachelor Deepak, who has chosen her precisely because she is so dowdy -- and plump, compliant and traditional. He has decided he is through with ''snappy witty women with low-fat bodies and high-maintenance demands.'' Chila's oldest friends, Tania and Sunita, are understandably a little worried for her. The book is about how these three childhood companions struggle to move between the cloistered, samosa-nibbling world of their parents and freewheeling contemporary London. Chila, at first, appears to have it easiest. Prone to deferential giggling, she seems content to stay at home and organize her spices. Sunita is in a tougher spot: a onetime campus feminist, she can't understand how she became an overweight and depressed mother of two, stuck in a sexless, surprisingly traditional Indian marriage. Beautiful, provocative Tania lives with an English boyfriend and works as a documentary filmmaker. But she is perpetually restless and at war with her past. The story revolves around a film Tania makes about love and marriage among Indians in England, using her friends as subjects. The film reveals the fissures in their lives -- and her own. Syal is a television actress who has written extensively for the screen, and while her new novel veers occasionally into melodrama, it is gossipy, funny and thoroughly entertaining. She manages to get inside the heads of three very different characters, inspiring sympathy for both tricky, adulterous sirens and sari-clad housewives.</p>
