        <p>Through her years as a solo artist, Juliana Hatfield, former Blake Babies singer, has created appealing songs with powerful guitar hooks, agreeable melodies and confessional lyrics. She's a mighty guitar player and her new offering, a double album package displaying her gentle side as well as her take-no-prisoners persona.</p>
        <p>The sensitive ''Beautiful Creature'' is a collection of gentle acoustic-based ballads, while ''Total System Failure,'' recorded with her touring band as Juliana's Pony, is a heavy-metal recording featuring chunky distorted guitars and acerbic lyrics.</p>

        <p>Ms. Hatfield, who performs at Maxwell's in Hoboken at 9 p.m. Tuesday, can sweetly cajole then blast away with her bare-to-the-bone delivery.</p>
