        <p>IN what could become one of the state's most closely watched political contests, Thomas J. Abinanti, 53, the county legislator from Greenburgh, has announced his second bid to unseat Nicholas A. Spano, 45, the state senator from Yonkers and one of the county's most visible Republican officials.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be a tough race,'' Vincent Natrella, chairman of the Westchester Conservative Party, predicted. ''The Democrats see this as a winnable seat.''</p>

        <p>IN what could become one of the state's most closely watched political contests, Thomas J. Abinanti, 53, the county legislator from Greenburgh, has announced his second bid to unseat Nicholas A. Spano, 45, the state senator from Yonkers and one of the county's most visible Republican officials.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be a tough race,'' Vincent Natrella, chairman of the Westchester Conservative Party, predicted. ''The Democrats see this as a winnable seat.''</p>
        <p>The Conservative Party endorsed Mr. Spano this year, but with some reluctance. Mr. Natrella said that some Conservatives, unhappy with Mr. Spano's pro-choice stance, may vote for Right-to-Life candidates.</p>
        <p>John Jacono, chairman of the Yonkers Republican party, disagreed with Mr. Natrella's assessment. ''I don't see that the odds are so against him,'' Mr. Jacono said, adding that Yonkersvoters would form a large  bloc for Mr. Spano's re-election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano also disagreed with Mr. Natrella's prediction, saying his support among Conservatives remains strong. Also, Mr. Spano said that as a moderate Republican he draws support from Democrats, many of whom rally around his middle-of-the-road positions and his efforts on behalf of gun control and a woman's right to reproductive freedom.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abinanti's support, too, is open to question. He and the county's Democratic chairman, David Alpert, have clashed on several issues, among them County Executive Andrew J. Spano's proposal to borrow against future tobacco settlement monies to reduce taxes now and the use of spray pesticides to quell the outbreak of the West Nile virus.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alpert has not thrown the party's support behind Mr. Abinanti, leaving that to local Democratic organizations. Eastchester and Greenburgh have endorsed him, but Yonkers -- home to another Democratic challenger to Senator Spano, Steve Ploski -- has yet to decide. Calls to Mr. Alpert were not returned.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ploski, who ran against Senator Spano two years ago, may challenge Mr. Abinanti in a primary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abinanti announced his bid for the state Senate last Sunday at a Dobbs Ferry park, promising to fight for families and not the powers that can afford to buy votes. Referring to Mr. Spano's reputation as a political deal maker, Mr. Abinanti said: ''I will be the people's senator. I will respond to cares, not to contributions, and I will not lay down to special interests.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano has countered the deal-maker label by saying he is proud of his ability to work in a bipartisan manner. ''Some people characterize it as making deals,'' he said. ''I characterize it as doing my job representing all of the people of Westchester.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Abinanti promised to oppose overdevelopment, broaden gun control, attack teenage smoking and increase spending for public schools in the district, which includes most of Yonkers, a portion of White Plains, Greenburgh and its six villages, and Eastchester and its two villages. He said the Yonkers schools, especially, are being shortchanged by the state.</p>
        <p>He is serving his fifth term representing the 12th District on the Board of Legislators, which is wholly contained within the town of Greenburgh. He is majority leader of the Board, chairman of the Committee on Health and co-chairman of the Rules Committee.</p>
        <p>On the board, he has promoted laws that control gun use, mob influence in the trash industry and teenage smoking. Mr. Spano, who has been a senator since 1987 and is seeking his eighth term, was the county's Republican chairman until last year. He is the assistant majority leader in the Senate and chairman of the Labor Committee. Previously, he served in the State Assembly.</p>
