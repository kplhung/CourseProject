        <p>AT some point in the history of modern cities, someone figured out that horses pulling heavy loads along the streets of a city could step on a manhole cover, slip and break a leg.</p>
        <p>The smooth iron discs weren't exactly safe for human pedestrians either. And so, decorated with richly textured starbursts, snowflakes, flowers and cartwheels, manhole covers entered a golden age.</p>
        <p>Perhaps nowhere was this more evident than in New York City, whose various jurisdictions employed several companies for railway, water, sewage, electric, coal and telephone services, each of which recognized the potential of manhole covers as promotional opportunities and artistic expressions.</p>
        <p>''The sidewalks of New York were extremely important to New Yorkers because people walked so much,'' said John R. Stilgoe, a professor of environmental studies at Harvard University. When designing manhole covers, he said, the idea was that ''when you looked down, which you often did, it might as well be attractive.''</p>
        <p>Looking down was how Diana Stuart got her start as New York City's unofficial manhole maven, 12 years ago. Ms. Stuart, who grew up in Queens, was walking in Upper Manhattan when she saw a manhole cover studded with an eye-catching pattern of little lines.</p>
        <p>''I thought, 'My heavens, these are astounding things,' '' she said. ''So they started to intrigue me, and then I started looking down more and more, and in the five boroughs I discovered the wealth of designs.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stuart, an office administrator, began photographing the historic covers, most dating to the 19th century. The city became a challenging puzzle for her as she studied old hardware catalogs and city directories to determine the provenance of several thousand specimens.</p>
        <p>''A given foundry could have made a dozen different designs,'' she said, noting that by 1880 there were more than 120 foundries in Brooklyn alone, employing nearly 4,000 men. Most had an artisan who would make a manhole design out of wood. The cover itself would then be cast in a sand mold.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Stuart, the sleuthing was not always straightforward. Many of the foundries that made the plates no longer existed. At times, foundries worked together, putting both their names on a manhole. Older covers tended to be square rather than circular, and had thicker lettering with serifs.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the age of a cover could be deduced by the foundry address printed on it; some changed locations several times throughout their existence. Nor did New York foundries make manhole covers for New York alone. Starting in the early to mid-1800's, they exported these items.</p>
        <p>Taking her research further, Ms. Stuart began to look at coal chutes and vault covers, which in the days before electricity  illuminated the work spaces and storage areas below sidewalks. The covers drew in natural light through rows of small glass insets still embedded in the ground in front of older industrial buildings in SoHo, TriBeCa and elsewhere. Eventually, Ms. Stuart compiled her findings in a book, ''Treasures Where You Walk: The Art and Design of Manhole and Coal Chute Covers, NY City,'' due out later this year.</p>
        <p>But even as she worked, Ms. Stuart's field of research narrowed. Weeks after photographing a manhole with a unique cover, she would return to find it paved over. She tracked the fate of 30 or 40 manhole covers whose photographs were donated to the New-York Historical Society in 1980 and found that at least half had disappeared.</p>
        <p>''No one knows, no one cares, and if you're a street constructor you're just going to throw it into a landfill because it's more trouble for you,'' she said. ''And that's heartbreaking.''</p>
        <p>Even in the city's historic districts, manhole covers are not protected. But Ms. Stuart is lobbying to change that, and Katy McNabb, a spokeswoman for the Landmarks Preservation Commission, said it was ''something we're thinking about.''</p>
        <p>New York City still has 600,000 covers, though not in the variety it once did.</p>
        <p>''Increasingly, the manhole covers are standardized,'' said Professor Stilgoe, noting that the number of companies that use them has dwindled. ''People don't think about it very much any more,'' he said, ''but Consolidated Edison is just that,'' a consolidation of different companies that once served the city.</p>
        <p>Still, a glance at any New York street or sidewalk still reveals stories from the past. Starting today, visitors can view Ms. Stuart's photographs of extinct and endangered manhole covers at the Brooklyn Center for the Urban Environment, Prospect Park Tennis House, weekends through Sept. 3.</p>
