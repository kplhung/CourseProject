        <p>AFTER three nights of rain, the organizers of the carnival at St. Charles Borromeo Church here were beginning to panic. Their fund-raising efforts were down by $35,000 compared with the same point in the week a year before. On Thursday morning, Jerry Caruso, a co-chairman of the carnival, took matters into his own hands.</p>
        <p>''I decided to change the panzarotti oil myself, as my sacrifice to the carnival gods that we'd have good weather,'' Mr. Caruso said. ''I'm not a superstitious person, but the sun did come out.''</p>
        <p>By the end of the week, Mr. Caruso hopes to hit the $200,000 mark, in keeping with the most successful years in the carnival's recent history. When the carnival started here in 1969, the event raised $10,000 for the church's Sunday school program. Today, the funds are still used for the religious education program and to keep down tuition at the church's parochial school.</p>
        <p>About one-third of the money raised comes from the percentage of ticket sales the sponsoring organization receives from the carnival operators for the various rides. The rest of the church's proceeds comes from sale of foods, games and raffle tickets. Morris Vivona Sr., whose company, Amusements of America, provides the rides here, says his percentage arrangements vary from carnival to carnival, with the better locations, like this one, receiving a bigger cut.</p>
        <p>Typically, the sponsor will receive from 10 to 25 percent of ticket sales.</p>
        <p>Around the country, churches, schools, civic groups and fraternal orders seek out carnivals to help draw the public to their fund-raising events. Carnivals raise more than $100 million annually for nonprofit  organizations nationwide, says Bob Johnson, executive director of the carnival industry's trade organization, the Outdoor Amusement Business Association.</p>
        <p>''For over 100 years, carnivals continue to be very popular and continue to raise incredible amounts of money for charity,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''We are wanted and needed and there aren't enough carnivals to fulfill the need.''</p>
        <p>The purist might question the notion of a carnival, with its racy reputation and late-night thrills, providing major funding to a church's coffers.</p>
        <p>''It's what we call a necessary evil,'' said the Rev. John Skwara of Our Lady of Czestochowa Church in South Plainfield.</p>
        <p>That necessary evil is what paid off the debt on their new church in 12 years rather than the usual 30.</p>
        <p>Father Skwara said when he came to South Plainfield in 1972, the church had only 100 parishioners and an income of about $200 a week, ''and that was after I'd sweep the floor and clean out the collection boxes.''</p>
        <p>The church owned three city blocks of land, but needed additional parcels and major capital to build a new church. Enter the carnival.</p>
        <p>Today, the modern building with its tall curving brick spire sits proudly on Hamilton Boulevard, serving 450 parishioners. The church receives 25 percent of ticket sales, plus profits from food and games at its annual carnival, totaling from $30,000 to $35,000. With the building paid off, the funds are now mostly used for maintenance and Sunday school programs.</p>
        <p>''We may get to the point where we say we don't need the carnival anymore,'' said Father Skwara, ''but the kids really look forward to it. In a little town like this, it's a big thing.''</p>
