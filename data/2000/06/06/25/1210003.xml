      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>THINK of a music so sure of its power that it need not raise its voice above mezzo piano. Think of graceful arcs of phrase reminiscent of Bellini. The harmonic and rhythmic language is received, not invented, yet its predictabilities are paradoxically filled with surprise. Wonder as well at how such extremes of civility emanate from a region seemingly condemned to political turmoil and chronic violence. What Latin America struggles to achieve in its civic life it produces effortlessly in its musical art.</p>
        <p>That art is carried to its delicate conclusion in the music of Joao Gilberto, the Brazilian composer, singer and guitarist, who offered an uninterrupted hour and a half of songs and instrumentals recently at Carnegie Hall. Facing a JVC Jazz Festival audience left restless and unnerved by an hour's delay, Mr. Gilberto (whose hotel, by the way, was only a few doors down 57th Street) finally arrived, excused himself lamely and tamed his listeners in five minutes. The precision of the music evidently does not extend to private life.</p>

        <p>THINK of a music so sure of its power that it need not raise its voice above mezzo piano. Think of graceful arcs of phrase reminiscent of Bellini. The harmonic and rhythmic language is received, not invented, yet its predictabilities are paradoxically filled with surprise. Wonder as well at how such extremes of civility emanate from a region seemingly condemned to political turmoil and chronic violence. What Latin America struggles to achieve in its civic life it produces effortlessly in its musical art.</p>
        <p>That art is carried to its delicate conclusion in the music of Joao Gilberto, the Brazilian composer, singer and guitarist, who offered an uninterrupted hour and a half of songs and instrumentals recently at Carnegie Hall. Facing a JVC Jazz Festival audience left restless and unnerved by an hour's delay, Mr. Gilberto (whose hotel, by the way, was only a few doors down 57th Street) finally arrived, excused himself lamely and tamed his listeners in five minutes. The precision of the music evidently does not extend to private life.</p>
        <p>Avuncular and almost frail in his late 60's, though with astonishing mastery of complex guitar patterns, Mr. Gilberto croaked tonelessly in his bottom notes and barely whispered in his middle range but sent out little ribbons of treble notes so pure and so loaded with emotion as to set the nerve ends to tingling. We know the stepwise chord patterns from years of listening to them yet await them eagerly. Mr. Gilberto toys with expectations by revoicing his chords, the highest notes suddenly made prominent in parallel harmony.</p>
        <p>Unexpected, too, are the disparities between sung text and musical line, where the words of phrases often speed to an end before the music beneath them has run its course. The compression extends to meter, Mr. Gilberto omitting beats at the end of an orderly pattern and throwing completed phrases in our laps before the ear is ready to receive them.</p>
        <p>Given the frequent crowding of words into single lines, the equilibrium is extraordinary. Describe it as utter simplicity achieved by means of unnoticed complication. One admires these feats of music with a joy and serenity that the vast majority of new music coming out of the concert hall and the opera stage is at a loss to replicate.</p>
        <p>More forward and perhaps rougher at the edges are other Latin American musical cultures. There is the Argentine tango, in the hands of performers like Astor Piazzolla. Here, too, the patterns of harmony and movement are predictable, but we never tire of them. Cuban music has been much in the news with the film and recordings of the Buena Vista Social Club. Again, straightforward messages arrive by way of thoughtfully layered rhythmic elements. They keep the ear busy and the heart full.</p>
        <p>Even at their loudest and most agitated, and even with the ornately lugubrious poetry that often surrounds them, the tango and the Cuban love song are unfettered efforts to communicate. The message, whether pleasant or not, is offered in welcoming terms. The music works to be understood.</p>
        <p>This is how Mozart composed, even though so much 20th-century classical music of the highest quality evidently felt otherwise. The horrors of the times needed accurate reportage, so music had no responsibility to be beautiful. I sense a real public stirring for the music of Messiaen. The average listener doesn't take the theoretical bases seriously and is only mildly amused by the attempts to replicate birdcalls. The ''Turangalila Symphony'' and the ''Quartet for the End of Time'' radiate a communicable spirit that new-music audiences have rarely found anywhere else.</p>
        <p>The songs of Mr. Gilberto and his compatriots Caetano Veloso and Antonio Carlos Jobim represent the art of Bellini outfitted with microphone and loudspeaker. Arias like ''Casta diva'' declaim because they happen inside a theater and must reach back to its farthest rows. At Carnegie Hall, Mr. Gilberto's intimate musical conversations maintained the illusion of a small room even as they were being projected to 2,800 people. I confess to little interest in sound technology, but the admirable electronic devices at work here managed to shrink the hall rather than inflate the music.</p>
        <p>In Mexico, one finds echoes of a trend familiar to Europe: the tendency of cultures with negligible folk and popular music to produce great classical composers. Germany (the village brass band versus Beethoven) and Austria (Schubert versus Schrammelmusik) are examples. Mexico has given us Revueltas, Chavez and some very interesting formal composers. It has also given us the mariachi band, whose charm quotient -- for me, at least -- runs to about four minutes. (I have always suspected the existence of courses at Mexican conservatories devoted to training mariachi trumpeters how to play out of tune.)</p>
        <p>So many Eastern European cultures have made their folk music a rallying point for political identity. Breaking free of such loyalties is not easy. Russian and Italian composers have done better jobs of assimilation, yet Spain's classical music, which I adore, still seems in thrall to its flamenco and folk-music roots.</p>
        <p>When postwar jazz reached into free form and extended-chord harmonies, it seemed to arrive at a limit and snap. In an instant, there were Elvis Presley and his four-chord accompaniments. The art of Mr. Gilberto is simple only in its effect, but a classical music that finds itself at the outer boundaries of esoterica may find a similar rescue somewhat to the south.</p>
