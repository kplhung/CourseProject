        <p>As one of their teachers began a lecture, 10 students sat with uncharacteristic attentiveness. That day, instead of looking at blackboards and maps in a drab classroom, they sat in the 37th-floor conference room of a corporate tower, surrounded by cosmetics displays. And instead of No. 2 pencils and erasers, their learning tools were Clinique's 7-Day Scrub Cream, Moisture Surge, Skin Cushion Body Wash and Long Last Soft Shine Lipstick. The lesson: the finer points of promotional packages, taught in part by William Lauder, the president of Clinique.</p>
        <p>The day was part of an effort organized by the Fresh Air Fund's Career Awareness Program, a year-round youth development initiative in New York City and at Camp Mariah in Fishkill, N.Y.. It is intended to make children aware of educational and career opportunities and the skills required to carry them out.</p>
        <p>''Most kids have heard of doctors and lawyers and movie stars, but there are a host of opportunities available at every company,'' said Jenny Morgenthau, the executive director of the Fresh Air Fund.</p>
        <p>The students -- six boys and four girls -- went to Clinique Laboratories, at 767 Fifth Avenue, to learn more about the corporate world.</p>
        <p>The children met some of Clinique's staff, and Mr. Lauder discussed running the company.</p>
        <p>''A business is a lot like a baseball team,'' said Mr. Lauder, who is a grandson of Estee Lauder, founder of the cosmetics company that runs Clinique. ''Everyone has to understand what their role is so that we can execute our goals.</p>
        <p>''My job is most like the coach,'' he said. He sets schedules and motivates his team, helping employees work together smoothly, he said.</p>
        <p>Then it was the students' turn to be part of a team. Their challenge was to design and name a promotional package that cost no more than $5, choose a spokesmodel from a stack of photos and allocate the money for a $100,000 advertising campaign. The students were divided into squads of two or three, and each group was given a marketing season. Their package had to include an appropriate array of items. The development teams huddled together around the conference table, sorting through different products.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to find the perfect mood for fall,'' said Wendina Williams, 12, a student at Public School 189 in Brooklyn..</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, three boys sitting nearby struggled over what to name their gift package. Jonel Ramus, 13, of Brooklyn, who said he wanted to be a civil engineer, had apparently found his role in his team. He sat with a calculator, tabulating the price of each proposed basket. His teammate, Jason Garcia, 14, of the  Bronx, had an idea for a name. ''How about Grey Poupon?'' he suggested, referring, perhaps, to the flashes of yellow in the mostly blue gift bag the team had chosen. After considering Blue Light, Fabulous and the hybrid Fabulous Blue Light, the team settled on Fablue. The name won them the award for most creative.</p>
        <p>The award for most cost effective went to Ms. Williams's group. Their gift pack, which cost just over $4, was far cheaper than the others, and would save Clinique lots of money, one staff member pointed out.</p>
        <p>In addition to the awards, which included prizes of Tommy Hilfiger bags, the students said that the projects helped them come away with some valuable insights and lessons, like compromise, quick thinking, and, of course, teamwork.</p>
        <p>''It may not seem like something we need to know now,'' said Wynter Williams, 13, from Thurgood Marshall Academy in Manhattan. ''But some day in the future we could come across a similar situation, and this will help.''</p>
        <p>Christopher Villafane, 15, from Graphic Arts Communication High School in the Bronx, added, ''These visits don't tell us exactly what we want to do, but they make us more serious, and give us more focus.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Lauder, whose company also sponsors High School Mentoring in New York and other community service programs, the experience was just as rewarding. ''It's a wonderful feeling if you can get someone interested and involved,'' he said.</p>
