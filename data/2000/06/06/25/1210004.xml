        <p>IT is the day after his last appearance on ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' -- a day that a more predictable type might describe as ''the first day of the rest of my life.'' Nothing so shopworn comes from Andy Richter.

        <p>''For Conan,'' he says in the vaguely Midwestern voice that launched a thousand ad-libs in the night, ''the show was a dream come true. I was more of a hired gun.

Now I'd like to go off into the woods with a camera, fake beards, armor, Roman centurions and Elizabethan hoop skirts, talk in accents, do 20 takes, edit it for a week and watch it without a laugh track.''</p>

        <p>IT is the day after his last appearance on ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' -- a day that a more predictable type might describe as ''the first day of the rest of my life.'' Nothing so shopworn comes from Andy Richter. He takes stock in his own way, doing a kind of ''In the Year 2000'' routine about where he is and where he is going (but without the flashlight under his chin or the squeaky falsetto refrain).</p>
        <p>''For Conan,'' he says in the vaguely Midwestern voice that launched a thousand ad-libs in the night, ''the show was a dream come true. I was more of a hired gun. I was never going to be it. I've done this every day in front of a live audience for seven years. Now I'd like to go off into the woods with a camera, fake beards, armor, Roman centurions and Elizabethan hoop skirts, talk in accents, do 20 takes, edit it for a week and watch it without a laugh track.''</p>
        <p>After seven years of postmidnight shenanigans, Mr. Richter has given up his place as the trusty No. 2 on ''Late Night'' to go it alone and concentrate on his acting career. But breaking out of the ''Late Night'' orbit has not lofted him beyond supporting-player status -- not yet, anyway. In his first post-''Late Night'' role, he is once again playing somebody's buddy: Richard Gere's hunting companion in the Robert Altman film ''Dr. T. and the Women'' (which, for the record, has no fake beards, armor, Roman centurions or Elizabethan hoop skirts). He will also appear, again in a supporting role, in a new movie starring Chris Rock.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richter has been gone only a few weeks, but already couch potatoes miss him. He was the last of the old-fashioned sidekicks, and for now, anyway, there are no plans to replace him on ''Late Night.'' And virtually no other show has a guy in a suit whose main responsibilities are to serve as the host's Greek chorus and to slide over when the guests start arriving. His fans say he single-handedly redefined what was once a television staple: the role of the sidekick.</p>
        <p>Buffalo Bob had Howdy Doody, after all, and Dave Garroway had a chimpanzee. As television's evolution continued, the sidekicks became human. Groucho Marx had George Fenneman on the quiz show ''You Bet Your Life.'' Late at night, Jack Paar had Hugh Downs in the 1950's, Joey Bishop had Regis Philbin in the 1960's, and Johnny Carson, of course, had the grand master of second bananas, Ed McMahon.</p>
        <p>''Ed McMahon made Tonto look like a three-dimensional character,'' said Robert J. Thompson, professor of film and television at Syracuse University. ''He was there to reflect the glory of Johnny. You get into this ironic age, where Letterman and Conan are so self-conscious of these kinds of formats, and the sidekick takes on a very different air.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Letterman chose not to have a sidekick in the traditional sense. He banters with his bandleader, Paul Shaffer, but Mr. Shaffer is more of a foil than a sidekick. Mr. O'Brien has a bandleader, too -- Max Weinberg, who is perhaps better known as Bruce Springsteen's drummer. But it was left to Mr. Richter to reinterpret the sidekick's place, doing the Ed McMahon job while simultaneously making fun of it.</p>
        <p>The result was a kind of comedic Siamese twinning, a dialogue between near-equals rather than the relationship of omnipotent host and fawning subordinate that Mr. Carson and Mr. McMahon perfected (though it must be noted that Mr. Richter always lost the staring contests with Mr. O'Brien). ''It was so much less planned than anyone knows,'' Mr. Richter said. ''Our rhythms were good together. We'd been doing bits around the office, just impromptu bits'' before the program went on the air. From their off-camera improvisation, Mr. Richter understood how they could work together: ''He's trilling, I'm the bass note.''</p>
        <p>But the sidekick was not a role he had been looking for -- he had joined the program expecting to do comedy sketches, not sit at the right hand of Mr. O'Brien.</p>
        <p>''When they started out, nobody knew what to do with this guy Andy,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''He wasn't your typical sidekick. He was heavier back then, and Conan was like mainstream entertainment's sidekick already -- never been on a show, been to Harvard, came out of left field, the kind you always expect to work as a supporting character but not be the guy in and of himself. Andy seemed to be coming from the planet Pluto for a while. It took a long time for people to get used to him. In the core demographic for Conan, which is college students, the anti-Andy sentiment was very, very strong for a long time.''</p>
        <p>Apparently, some NBC executives were also anti-Andy in the program's rocky first couple of seasons, though Mr. Richter gives Mr. O'Brien and the show's producers credit for not telling him that his perch next to Mr. O'Brien was precarious. Good thing, too. ''It was as though Andy was inventing himself as he went along,'' Mr. Thompson said, ''and by the time he left, he was one of the big appeals. Many college students were more likely to send a fan letter to Andy than to Conan.'' No less an authority on hipness than Janeane Garofalo told Entertainment Weekly magazine last month that ''his appeal is off the charts.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Philbin, too, sounded like a true fan. ''He may be the last official sidekick,'' he said of Mr. Richter.</p>
        <p>''The role has changed considerably since I did that,'' Mr. Philbin said. ''Now they're more a part of the show than just a prompter. In those days, you were there to make the host look good and that was the job, take it or leave it. I would come out in the opening segment and prompt Joey Bishop with my own observations about things, knowing that he would have a punch line. He was a great counterpuncher and that was what he wanted me to do, and I did it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Richter, Mr. Philbin said, ''had more to do than I did.''</p>
        <p>But the most important element of Mr. Richter's job description was the same -- and it was paramount for Mr. McMahon as well. ''I understood that my job was to support Johnny Carson,'' he wrote in his autobiography, ''For Laughing Out Loud'' (Warner, 1998). ''I didn't tell the jokes, I set up the jokes. I didn't get the laughs, I helped him get the laughs. Johnny and I never discussed this; we didn't have to. We were smart enough to see how well our relationship worked.'' Mr. McMahon said he had to undergo on-the-air behavior modification to preserve that relationship. ''At times I had to consciously stop myself from responding to something he said,'' Mr. McMahon wrote. Before he went on the air with Mr. Carson, ''I'd always had my own shows, I'd always been free to say whatever popped into my mind. But after a few weeks I had slipped quite comfortably into the role of straight man, his second banana.''</p>
        <p>Hugh Downs had played a similar role when Jack Paar was the host on ''Tonight,'' but like Mr. Richter on ''Late Night,'' he found himself caught up in a relationship that was evolving.</p>
        <p>''It started as an announcer's job,'' Mr. Downs said. ''I started out just saying, 'Here's Jack Paar.' In fact, I think at first I was only heard. Then I think they put a camera on me turning it over to him. Then he took to calling me over to the desk. Then the format was established: when he brought the first guest out, I'd move over to the sofa. He felt insecure and wanted me there by him and would ask me questions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Downs had another responsibility besides making the host feel comfortable, one that was never in Mr. Richter's portfolio: in his day, announcers did the commercials, live. There were no breaks while the commercials rolled, leaving the band to perform for the studio audience and the host to light up a cigar, as Mr. Letterman often did before his heart surgery. Unintentionally, the commercials often became funnier than anyone had bargained for.</p>
        <p>O NCE, I was standing, waiting to do this commercial,'' Mr. Downs said. ''I was going to demonstrate this can opener. I had a number of tin cans. Katharine Murray was on. Paar complimented her. Paar said to her, she had a good figure. She said, 'Destiny has shaped my end.' Paar threw it to me and I went into the commercial, which began, 'No matter what size or shape can you have, the Reliance can opener can handle it.' I got about that far and I was finished.''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Richter, having reinvented the sidekick's role and stayed with ''Late Night'' until it established itself as popular and profitable, why step aside?</p>
        <p>''I didn't have any real plan as to how long I would be on the show,'' Mr. Richter said. ''If you'd asked when we started, I would probably have said, 'I can see about seven years,' and that's exactly what we've done. It's not just the form. There are other things -- it became a cumulative effect: I became tired of doing a show every day. There's this pressure where you never feel you've done any one item justice because there's this slap-it-together-and-get-it-out-the-door feeling to the work. That's the way it was: Did we say all the lines right? Did the camera get the shot of the parrot? Yeah? O.K., we're done, on to the next thing. Could we do it any better? It's pretty slapdash when you're working so hard and putting out so much.''</p>
        <p>So why not simply take a sabbatical? ''Yeah,'' Mr. Richter sighed. ''People have said to me, 'Why don't you take leaves of absence like Max Weinberg does?' Springsteen's tour is pretty reliable in terms of the dates and when it's going to happen. But if you get hired for a movie and they say, 'We need you for two weeks,' that can stretch to five weeks just with the natural flow of shooting the film. I can't say I'm going to be gone next month and when the month's ending, say: 'They're going to need me another week and a half. The show you were writing for two guys, you've got to scrap that.' It would make the writers write two different shows. I couldn't do that.''</p>
