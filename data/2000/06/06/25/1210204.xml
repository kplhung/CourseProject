        <p>When you return, after a day of sightseeing, to your room at the Mansfield Hotel on West 44th Street and find your bedspread turned down, instead of a chocolate on the pillow you might find a CD called ''Salute to a Century of Jazz.''</p>
        <p>It is given to all the guests at the Mansfield and the four other Manhattan hotels owned by the Boutique Hotel Group: the Franklin, the Wales, the Shoreham and the Roger Williams.</p>
        <p>The 12 cuts were played by 20 New York musicians, and produced for the Boutique Group by Deborah Rath, the daytime host at WQCD, the FM ''smooth jazz'' station known as CD-101.9. The songs were written by three of the musicians: Onaje Allan Gumbs, Adam Klipple and John Osnes. The flutist Dave Valentin also appears.</p>
        <p>''All these guys are just stellar,'' Ms. Rath said. ''Between all of them, they have played with every jazz great out there.''</p>
        <p>Who came up with this alternative amenity? ''At 5:30 in the morning, I was watching Financial News Network and there was a rerun on about how retail stores were doing things to make ancillary income,'' said William Howell, president of the hotel group, which has largely been financed by Credit Suisse First Boston. Mr. Howell added that the report said Starbucks and Victoria's Secret commissioned their own CD's.</p>
        <p>The CD is ''something that has universal appeal,'' said Milvi Vehik, the vice president for sales and marketing at the hotel group. ''Everyone loves jazz,'' she added. ''It's a universal language.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Howell met Ms. Rath last fall and recognized her connections to New York jazz musicians. Ms. Rath had the musicians working in the studio until 4 a.m. and completed the album within a month.</p>
        <p>Now the musicians also play at two Boutique hotels off Fifth Avenue, the Mansfield at 12 West 44th Street on Wednesday evenings and the Shoreham at 33 West 55th Street on Thursdays.</p>
        <p>But if a guest misses the band for a Broadway show or dinner at a New York restaurant, there is a CD player in each room.</p>
        <p>''Suddenly you know right where you are,'' Ms. Rath said. ''You're in New York, the jazz center of the world.''</p>
