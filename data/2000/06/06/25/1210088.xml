        <p>CONSIDERING how valuable real estate has become in this state, it's a wonder that Bethlehem didn't have to put out a few more chairs for the crowd when it held a tax auction of a few lots, around a huge pond, no less, about a week ago.

        <p>Actually, this auction went a lot better than the last one. In 1996, none of the waterfront properties drew a single bid because no one showed up for the auction.</p>

        <p>CONSIDERING how valuable real estate has become in this state, it's a wonder that Bethlehem didn't have to put out a few more chairs for the crowd when it held a tax auction of a few lots, around a huge pond, no less, about a week ago. But when the auction ended, only 16 people had turned out.</p>
        <p>Actually, this auction went a lot better than the last one. In 1996, none of the waterfront properties drew a single bid because no one showed up for the auction.</p>
        <p>Lakefront property along Candlewood and Woodridge lakes is one thing, but land along Long Meadow Pond in a neighborhood called Kasson Grove is another. Formed in 1935 on what was once a cow pasture, Kasson Grove was intended as part of a waterfront summer community. Purchasing one lot, for about $100, gave buyers pond rights. The problem is that the pasture was divided into hundreds of 40-by-80-foot lots, meant for summer-only cottages, not year-round residences. Single lots were too small on which to build real houses and way too small for septic systems and wells. But some owners who bought several adjacent lots built small summer cottages that were later winterized and have become permanent homes. Today, with much more stringent requirements for building, there is not a single parcel in the whole Grove that would be considered appropriate for a home.</p>
        <p>James Rokos, director of health for Torrington Area Health District, said because of the nature of the soil there and the seasonal water table, a property owner would need about 15 of these small lots to build a home today on Kasson Grove property. ''If someone wants one lot to pitch a tent, that's O.K.,'' Mr. Rokos said. At the auction on June 17, two of the lots available were the tent-sized ones. A third one was larger and just across the pond from Kasson Grove.</p>
        <p>The town had gotten stuck with the lots because the owners owed back taxes. Some owners inherited the land and had no use for it. A few weeks ago, Gregory Leigland of Lutz, Fla., visited his two lots for the first time since he was a child and was shocked by what he found. He said residents of the Grove were using his lots as a dump.</p>
        <p>''My great-grandmother bought two tiny lots in 1969,'' Mr. Leigland said. ''My mother inherited it, and then I got it in 1992. I came up to look at it and it's a disgrace.'' Mr. Leigland's lot is valued at perhaps $2,000 and he owed about $800 in taxes on it.</p>
        <p>''It's not worth paying, to be stuck with it while someone else dumps garbage on it,'' he said. ''I told the tax collector I was going to go look and then I'd be back to pay, but now I'd like to just sign it over to the town.''</p>
        <p>A total of eight lots were scheduled for Saturday's auction, but one property owner contacted another who was losing four lots due to back taxes, struck a deal, and saved himself the risk of bidding at a public auction. Another property owner, contacted in Colorado, had second thoughts, Edie Rupe, the tax collector, said, and at the last moment paid her taxes even though she has no plans for using the lot.</p>
        <p>So that left three. Two near the pond were won for $1,300 by Douglas England of Waterbury, who was building a house adjacent to the lots, but just out of Kasson Grove. By buying the two lots, he said, he becomes a member of the Kasson Grove Association and is given access to the pond and the beach.</p>
        <p>Bidding lasted a few minutes, and only one other person competed against Mr. England. When he went to explore Kasson Grove after the auction, he discovered that the road stopped just about where his two lots began and they were a tangle of dense forest leading up to his backyard. ''I wanted the border to my yard,'' he said. ''I wanted to know exactly where my land ends. I'll make a path down to Spring Street, in Kasson Grove, bring my canoe down here and have it available, and we can walk to the lake.''</p>
        <p>Tiny houses, some in disrepair, led the way up to Mr. England's backyard. Dog pens, laundry lines and some wrecked cars dotted the area. ''These are not well-to-do places,'' he noted. ''People have just turned cottages into houses, and some of them are pretty tough, with little space heaters for the winter. Still, it seems better for people to raise their kids here than in a hot apartment in the city.''</p>
        <p>The town said it is going to pursue blight ordinances to order other property owners to clean up their land or houses. With the sale of delinquent tax properties and enforced clean up, Ms. Rupe said, Kasson Grove could become a more pleasant place. Ms. Rupe said her position is a difficult one. Auctions are held to clean up the tax record, but no one showed up for the last one. Even when the town sells property, they only get back taxes; any additional money goes to the state. Adjacent property owners did buy parcels at the first auction.</p>
        <p>''The original intention was to make it a recreational area with no thought for zoning,'' Ms. Rupe said. Other lakeside communities around the state are faced with similar problems, such as zoning and wetlands, and public health laws have grown more stringent.</p>
        <p>Although Bethlehem requires only 1 1/2 acres and 200 hundred feet of road frontage for a home, no lots in Kasson Grove meet this requirement, not to mention Torrington Area Health District specifications.</p>
        <p>Unless there is a viable structure on the land, many people who inherit lots don't know quite what to do with them. Ms. Rupe said she had spent a lot of time on the Internet, looking up people whose names were on the tax rolls and who had stopped paying. Sometimes, she added, she finds them; other times there isn't even a trace.</p>
        <p>''We've had to turn a lot of people down for building,'' Mr. Rokos said. ''Some places are grandfathered in and we give them an idea of the limitations and how to conserve water to save their septic systems. A lot aren't suitable year round, especially not for families. We have two concerns, the public health of the community and the quality of the lake. If the lake deteriorates, they've lost any property value they had.''  The third lot auctioned this month was on the opposite side of the pond from Kasson Grove, near Bethlehem's town beach. There was considerably more competition for this piece of waterfront property, which was finally bought for $18,000 by an adjacent-property owner. Other bidders wanted the parcel for a boat dock, driving the price up considerably from its assessed value of $2,970. Delinquent taxes totaled $3,560.63. Ms. Rupe was never able to find the original property owner.</p>
        <p>''There's another three to four properties coming up,'' she said. ''After three years with no payment on taxes, we're really going to start going after them.''</p>
        <p>Once the property has been sold at auction, the original owners still have six months to pay the taxes and have the property returned to them. ''The ones we end up selling tend to belong to elderly people who are no longer interested in the property, or they inherited it and didn't want it in the first place, and now want to unload it,'' Ms. Rupe said.</p>
        <p>The best solution for Kasson Grove, said Mr. Rokos of the Torrington Area Health District, was for individual owners to acquire every available adjacent property and give themselves more room to meet the requirements for septic and wells. That would gradually improve the entire neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''It definitely benefits the lake and reduces the chance of groundwater contamination,'' he said. ''Those two things ultimately improve property values.''</p>
