        <p>MICHAEL SCHNEIDER rarely sees his friends anymore. He barely notices the two tall models who come and go handing him paperwork in his White Plains office. And he is oblivious to the countless snapshots of young women in bikinis scattered around the office.</p>
        <p>These days, there is only one model that grabs his attention, and it is neither tall nor blond nor bikini clad. It is the business model he hopes will convince investors that his online modeling agency, umodels.com, is certain to be a multimillion-dollar Internet business ready for a public offering.</p>
        <p>He is now in that frantic stage of incubating a dot-com business known as the race to market. Sitting in his office on a recent weekday, he wore the unofficial uniform for a young entrepreneur, oversize polo shirt, baggy cargo pants and sneakers.</p>
        <p>But his work ethic is hardly casual. He puts in 14-hour days and calls them too short. He listens to hyper-repetitive electronic music, which seems to fuel his obsessive work pace.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schneider is among a bumper crop of young Internet entrepreneurs in the county. In the past, most Westchester Web wunderkind fled for more fertile ground in Manhattan's rich Internet community. But these days, many are staying here, encouraged that the county is finally getting sufficiently ''wired'' to support growing e-businesses.</p>
        <p>While some industry experts still say there is no substitute for Silicon Alley for incubating an online company, more young entrepreneurs, it seems, are taking advantage of Westchester's growing talented work force, increased broadband access and relief from the rat race. Besides, they say, Manhattan is still close by for networking and meeting clients and investors.</p>
        <p>''We're beginning to see a real buzz going on in Westchester,'' said Dennis J. Eaton, executive director of Info River Valley, a nonprofit group that supports networking among Internet and information technology businesses in the Hudson Valley.</p>
        <p>Westchester is coming of age online, Mr. Eaton said, adding that there are more home-grown Internet entrepreneurs here, and more staying here.</p>
        <p>''Resources are getting a little tight in New York, and there's a growing support structure up here,'' he said. ''It's no longer like being out in the sticks.''</p>
        <p>Responding to demand from local entrepreneurs seeking investors, and vice-versa, the Westchester Venture Group organized a breakfast conference last month at the Rye Town Hilton. There, a panel of four venture capitalists lectured roughly 200 entrepreneurs on how to attract investors.</p>
        <p>Those attending included I.B.M. retirees and nattily dressed entrepreneurs from Manhattan. But there was also a handful of baby-faced businessmen. They rushed to the podium after the talk and, like frenzied autograph seekers, pushed their business plans up to the panel of investors. One of those who saw an opportunity in serving the county's new generation of Internet whiz kids is Kara Goudie, who quit her job in Manhattan finding ''smart'' office space for Internet companies because she saw a more pressing need in Westchester. She helped create Suite Solutions, in White Plains, which provides short-term office space.</p>
        <p>Ms. Goudie converted 25,000 square feet of office space on the fourth floor of 75 South Broadway into hip-looking offices, outfitted with computers, broadband access, conference rooms and kitchens.</p>
        <p>''I thought I'd be targeting lawyers and accountants,'' Ms. Goudie, the company's managing director, said. ''Fifty percent of my Internet companies are run by people under 25. It's kind of shocking.''</p>
        <p>A staff provides various services for tenants, including answering phones, ordering lunch, calling taxis and making travel arrangements. One thing about young entrepreneurs rushing their Web sites to market,  she explained, ''They don't have a clue what they need for an office, whether it's getting voice mail or basic supplies.''</p>
        <p>In a conference room there recently, four young men presented their business plan to executives from a Pennsylvania-based investment firm.</p>
        <p>The four -- F. Matthew Pepe, Ram Ahluwalia, Azhar Abdul-Quader and Suraj K. Gupta -- are all Westchester natives and all under 25, and they founded Theworkzone.com last year. Three are Ivy League graduates and the other comes from a family that owns a construction company.</p>
        <p>The site, an online marketplace for the construction industry, is being developed in partnership with the Construction Industry Council, a trade association in Tarrytown.</p>
        <p>Down the hall, in a corner office, several teenagers worked on teenfx.com, an interactive Web site for teenagers created by Jacqueline L. Thorpy when she was a senior at Scarsdale High School.</p>
        <p>The site, which focuses on teenage heartthrobs, health, dating and fashion, is highly popular. It has gotten an average of 2.5 million visitors a month since last November, Ms. Thorpy, who is 19, said.</p>
        <p>The company recently received its first round of financing from investors, she said, ''but I've been told I really can't say at this stage how much.'' Ms. Thorpy added that she has rejected several lucrative offers to sell part ownership to large companies because ''I have a lot of future developments planned to make the site the best it can be.''</p>
        <p>After giving a multimedia presentation to her eighth-grade class, Ms. Thorpy, at 14, created and launched three teenage Web sites, some of the earliest on the Internet. At first, the sites simply ranked favorite teenage products like jeans, shirts and facial cleansers. Then she began interviewing classmates and including polls, message boards, articles written by teenagers and surveys. She has gotten dozens of teenage correspondents across the country to contribute articles.</p>
        <p>Ms. Thorpy said that in high school, everyone hung out online, but there was no real community of entrepreneurs.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know anyone who was doing what I was doing,'' said Ms. Thorpy, who now sees more of a ''scene'' emerging. She plans to keep the company's main office in Westchester because most of her employees, either friends or people who answered her advertisements, live locally. She plans to set up a smaller office next year in Manhattan, however, to help the company's chief operating officer and marketing director, who usually work in the city.</p>
        <p>Though her future looks bright, she said she tries to keep her business separate from the rest of her life.</p>
        <p>''It's not something I go around talking about,'' said Ms. Thorpy, a black belt in karate and a ski racer. ''I'm basically out for the game and the fun. I love learning new technology and new ways of getting through to teens so they can be themselves on line.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Thorpy is a sophomore at the Business School at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, known for its computer science program and graduates who become successful Internet entrepreneurs. She takes courses that will help build her Web skills, including entrepreneurship, organizational behavior and professional writing.</p>
        <p>Ms. Thorpy originally got her parents to invest in Teenfx.com, and she began working on it at home, then at college. Her parents had recently started their own medical software company in Westchester. Her mother quit her job as a professor of biochemistry to run it, and her father kept his medical practice. Even her brother, a high school senior, has become an entrepreneur, she said, breeding and selling lizards.</p>
        <p>Ms. Thorpy recently hired chief technology and operating officers and an advertising manager, all roughly twice her age.</p>
        <p>Alan Brody, president of Ibreakfast.com, a Scarsdale company that introduces Internet entrepreneurs to investors, said entrepreneurs have a more difficult task starting their businesses in Westchester than in Manhattan. The lack of ready access to investors and to high-speed broadband lines in Westchester, he said, ''spoils the climate for incubating businesses.''</p>
        <p>He also said start-ups have a harder time finding talent in the county. ''Young people get an inkling of what they can do, and they're off to Manhattan,'' he said. ''The young movers and shakers gravitate to the city.</p>
        <p>''To grow an Internet business, you have to find people who are extremely dedicated, and these tend to be young single people who live in apartments, not suburban communities. People just aren't willing to sacrifice that much when they have a mortgage, a Range Rover and Mercedes to support.''</p>
        <p>Also, he said, Westchester lacks ''a good shmooze scene,'' necessary for making a fertile start-up community.</p>
        <p>''You need dozens of affiliates to create a yeasty environment and the serendipity to make deals,'' he said. ''They need other young people who speak their language, and suburbia is sterile for that. You need a tolerant environment that acts as an incubator, and in Westchester there's a more traditional way of thinking. It's not a hotbed of unusual, radical thought.''</p>
        <p>Seth Godin, who started one of Westchester's first Internet companies, Yoyodyne Entertainment, in 1991 in Irvington, agreed.</p>
        <p>''In Westchester, you're more likely to find a bedroom community mindset where lawyers, doctors, corporate types are the respectable professions,'' he said, ''while in Silicon Alley it is the entrepreneur who is the successful role model.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Godin expanded Yoyodyne.com, an online marketing company, to 50 employees. In October 1998, Yahoo.com bought it for $30 million in stock, to integrate with its own direct marketing services.</p>
        <p>One obstacle to starting Internet companies in Westchester, he said, is a continuing reluctance to recognize Web work as a legitimate, stable job.</p>
        <p>''When I hired local young people, I used to have to talk to their parents,'' he said. ''Their kid's doing a job no one's ever heard of, for a company no one's ever heard of, in an industry no one's ever heard of. They'd  ask, 'But is it steady?' I'd say, 'No, it's not steady, but it's fun.' That's very different than the mindset that built Westchester.''</p>
        <p>In 1996, Andrew Weinreich, then a 28-year-old lawyer, and his best friend from Edgemont High School, Adam Seifer, founded Sixdegrees.com, which helps users develop an e-mail network of social contacts. He located it in Manhattan, but cultivated it by keeping in touch with his Edgemont friends and mining other Westchester contacts, he said.</p>
        <p>They soon had 80 employees, and the company was bought in 1998 by Youthstream Media Networks for $125 million worth of stock.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weinreich, who graduated from the Unversity of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, said: ''My Edgemont ties have been just as helpful as my Penn ties. In this business, your most important resource is people. You want to be around the brightest ones you can, and Westchester generates a lot of well-educated, extraordinarily bright people.'</p>
        <p>Mr. Schneider of Umodels.com, also networks locally. He has two local acquaintances helping him prepare his executive business plan to present to investors.</p>
        <p>One friend is a student at the Wharton Business School, and the other just got $2 million in financing for his own site, Uconnections.com.</p>
        <p>From childhood, it seems, being an entrepreneur was Mr. Schneider's destiny.</p>
        <p>At 11, he was told he was too young to become a paperboy. He found a job emptying garbage cans but soon decided he would be better off as his own boss, and he started a pet-sitting business.</p>
        <p>At 15 while a sophomore at Ossining High School, he started a computer consulting business, charging clients $40 an hour, and by 16, he had saved about $60,000. By investing in technology stocks, he has increased his assets to $250,000.</p>
        <p>As a business management major at the University of Delaware, he made and sold calendars of Delaware U. coeds in bikinis. He began booking modeling jobs for the women, and then started Umodels.com, which represents about 350 models nationwide and gets more than 2,000 visitors daily.</p>
        <p>The company is in Westchester, he said, because he enjoys being near his family for their support. ''Doing this is stressful enough,'' he said. ''Can you imagine being in the city?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schneider wants to expand the site and relaunch it by September before others fill the niche. He said he has invested about $100,000 in the business and is seeking an investor to put up $1 million.</p>
        <p>On his desk is a newsletter from the BMW Car Care Club of America -- he drives a powder-blue 325is -- and a desktop calendar showing a woman in a bikini lying in the surf. But nothing seems to spur Mr. Schneider's enthusiasm like his business.</p>
        <p>If he does socialize, he meets clients in Manhattan. In college, he joined a fraternity, but after missing the air guitar competition during Greek Week he explained to his fraternity brothers that he'd rather nurture his business than his social life. He had a core group of buddies dating back to nursery school. He saw them at a funeral recently and apologized for not keeping in touch.</p>
        <p>''They said, 'Yeah, we know, we're going to see you on the cover of a magazine one day,'' he recalled.</p>
        <p>''My business is my life,'' he said. ''I've always been an individual, done things my own way. I picked being an entrepreneur over being one of the guys, and I think it's made me a stronger person.</p>
        <p>''I could have gotten a stable job and living in Manhattan like a king, but I'd feel guilty living that way, spoiling myself at a young age. I'm making sacrifices now to enjoy life later on.''</p>
        <p>Four Companies That Hope To Become the Next Dot-Com Sensation</p>
        <p>Happyhours.com</p>
        <p>Stephen Gilberg, 27, said he is working to make his Web site ''the Yahoo for bars.''</p>
        <p>In 1997 he founded Happyhours .com, which lists cocktail hours, nightly drink specials and promotional events at more than 10,000 bars across the country.</p>
        <p>He said he has invested more than $100,000, mostly his own money, to expand the site into a drink and dining portal with large liquor and food companies as sponsors. He started the site, which he calls ''a social search engine,'' while living in London compiling a travel guide.</p>
        <p>''There's such a lack of communication between companies and consumers in this industry,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gilberg, who recently bought a house in Chappaqua, said he has been approached to sell the Mount Vernon-based site, as well as rights to establish a bar and make a film on the theme.</p>
        <p>''A movie based on Happyhours?'' he said. ''Do you know how big that would be for us?''</p>
        <p>Thepit.com</p>
        <p>Three twentysomethings recently quit lucrative jobs to start Thepit.com in White Plains. When it begins this fall, it will sell sports memorabilia, like trading cards.</p>
        <p>The site is the brainchild of Marc Lore, who at 25 became an executive vice president at Sanwa International, a Japanese bank. His goal back then was to become a chief executive of a bank, but last year he decided to leave his job -- and his annual salary of $580,000.</p>
        <p>He took on as partners Lakshman Chandra, 29, his business manager at Sanwa, and Vinit Bharara, a former Manhattan lawyer. Mr. Lore, who lives in Bronxville, has high goals for the site.</p>
        <p>''We didn't quit our jobs to make a few million dollars,'' he said. ''We plan on creating a multi-billion-dollar industry giant.''</p>
        <p>He said he set the company up in White Plains partly because rents are lower than in Manhattan. ''We're a 30-minute train ride from the city,'' he said, ''and there are a lot of talented people in Westchester who don't want to commute anymore.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bharara, who borrowed money to support himself to work on the business, called the venture ''a once in a lifetime opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Coolsiteoftheday.com</p>
        <p>Being a young entrepreneur does not have to mean making millions or bust. Many local start-ups remain quietly lucrative businesses operating inside suburban houses.</p>
        <p>Michael Corso bought a dormant Web site, coolsiteoftheday.com, in 1997, ''for peanuts,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Since then, he has worked to expand it into a much larger portal site, and it is now valued at $7 million, he said, based on its high volume of traffic. Mr. Corso, 39, said he is considering an offer from a Wall Street venture capital firm to invest $3 million in exchange for 40 percent ownership.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corso works out of his house, on an acre of wooded property in Chappaqua. His two full-time and six part-time workers all work out of their homes and communicate by e-mail. A graduate in 1984 from the Wharton School of Business, he worked in Manhattan for 15 years as a television producer and online as a music promoter.</p>
        <p>''One thing I despised more than anything was commuting, so the Internet was the greatest gift I could get. It's nice to watch deer and foxes run by your window during your work day.''</p>
        <p>Cloud9.net</p>
        <p>In 1993, when he was 15 and a sophomore at Ardsley High School, Scott Drassinower, started Cloud9.net, Westchester's first local Internet service provider. He worked on it in the office of his father, a doctor, in White Plains after school.</p>
        <p>There were minor problems early on. One morning, while rushing to school, Mr. Drassinower unknowingly dislodged a plug from the server and more than 100 clients lost Internet service until he got out of school that day and fixed it.</p>
        <p>But he soon had several hundred local clients, and he borrowed $60,000 from his father to expand the business, which slowly began producing decent revenue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Drassinower decided to attend Cornell University as a comparative literature major, paying the roughly $30,000-a-year tuition himself. He hired several employees and supervised the company by phone from his dormitory room, driving home in his Saab for major business projects.</p>
        <p>Now, after paying the bills in his White Plains office, including salaries for eight staff members, Mr. Drassinower makes a salary commensurate with other Internet executives, he said, but invests most of it in the company, whose value he estimates at about $2.5 million.</p>
        <p>He is 21 and plans to graduate next May.</p>
