        <p>Carlos Delgado hit his American League-leading 26th homer yesterday and Roy Halladay won his first start since being recalled from the minors as the Toronto Blue Jays won their fourth straight, 6-4, over the visiting Boston Red Sox.</p>
        <p>Halladay (3-4) allowed four runs and six hits in seven-plus innings. He struck out five and walked two, leaving with a 5-2 lead in the eighth after consecutive singles by Jeff Frye and Carl Everett.</p>
        <p>Nomar Garciaparra, the A.L. batting leader at .392, followed with a run-scoring grounder off Paul Quantrill. Brian Daubach struck out, and Jason Varitek hit a run-scoring single to make it 5-4.</p>
        <p>Brad Fullmer homered in the bottom half of the eighth off Rheal Cormier.</p>
        <p>INDIANS 8-8, TIGERS 1-14: Bobby Higginson's third two-run homer of the game ignited Detroit's six-run seventh inning as the Tigers rallied from seven runs down for an improbable 14-8 victory over the Indians and a split of their day-night doubleheader in Cleveland.</p>
        <p>Wendell Magee's three-run homer capped Detroit's seventh as the Tigers scored 12 consecutive runs to hand Cleveland its most devastating loss in an already disappointing season.</p>
        <p>In the first game, Bartolo Colon mixed his blazing fastball with a nasty curve to overpower Detroit between rain delays, and Jim Thome had three R.B.I.</p>
        <p>MARINERS 2, ORIOLES 1: John Halama (7-3) won for the first time in nearly a month, and Seattle extended its season-best winning streak to five games, handing visiting Baltimore its eighth straight loss.</p>
        <p>Kazuhiro Sasaki pitched the ninth for his 13th save in 15 chances, dropping Baltimore's record at Safeco Field to 0-6. Seattle has won seven consecutive series for the first time in franchise history.</p>
        <p>ROYALS 8, ATHLETICS 3: Mike Quinn hit a three-run homer and Luis Ordaz added three R.B.I. with a two-run single and a sacrifice fly as visiting Kansas City ended Oakland's nine-game winning streak.</p>
        <p>Oakland, which hit .368 during the winning streak and averaged more than 10 runs a game, was held to two extra-base hits -- a first-inning double by Jason Giambi and a double by Randy Velarde in the ninth.</p>
