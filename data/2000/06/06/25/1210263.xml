        <p>If money were not a factor, where would you go for vacation? How about Mir?</p>
        <p>That is the dream destination of Dennis Tito, an American investment manager and multimillionaire who said he planned to become the first tourist in space by visiting the Russian space station next spring. Mr. Tito, 59, signed on with MirCorp, a Netherlands-based company that leases commercial rights to the spacecraft, to pay an estimated $20 million for the flight. If he passes Russian medical tests, he will accompany two astronauts for a week.</p>

        <p>But he'll be traveling strictly tourist class on a ship with a history of mishaps and near calamities, no shower and the ambience of a cluttered dormitory. The modules are jury-rigged with wiring and conduits; sometimes the interior is hot and smells of leaking coolant.</p>
        <p>Ah, but think of the bragging rights.</p>
