        <p>A FULL-SERVICE hotel and conference center is to go up in the Lafayette Yard area of Trenton, giving the city a hotel for the first time since the 1980's and bringing to an end its unenviable distinction as the only state capital without lodging for visitors.</p>
        <p>Making the more than $46 million hotel a reality was not easy. It took three years of planning and a financing structure that required state and city subsidies, the creation of a nonprofit corporation to issue $31 million in tax-exempt bonds, and a city guarantee for the bonds. Local officials say that the 197-room hotel, to be operated by Marriott Conference Centers, part of the Marriott hotel chain, will be a new anchor in their longterm plan to revive Trenton as a tourist destination and boost the economy of the city, whose industrial base has withered over the last few decades.</p>
        <p>The other anchors -- a 6,150-seat minor-league baseball stadium and a 10,600-seat hockey arena -- were constructed in the last few years with public and private funds. Douglas H. Palmer, the mayor of Trenton, said that the hotel would strengthen that base because ''it will bring in over 60,000 people a year who will spend the night and have money to spend in the city.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Palmer said the hope is that housing, office and retail space would rise around the hotel, the stadium and the arena -- which are in a half-mile area -- and will spur other development. The hotel is about a block and half from the state capitol.</p>
        <p>The hotel project, on which site work began in April, will also include an $11.9 million, 657-car parking garage, which was financed by the Trenton Parking Authority in a separate bond issue. It will take shape on a 3.5-acre site at Lafayette and South Warren Streets, which is owned by the city and the Trenton Parking Authority and was formerly a public parking lot. The seven-story hotel, scheduled to open in early 2002,  will be linked to the adjacent Trenton War Memorial, a state historic landmark used for concerts and other cultural events that recently underwent a $38 million renovation. The last hotel in Trenton, the Capital Plaza Hotel, closed in 1986.</p>
        <p>The Marriott Conference Hotel at Lafayette Yard is to be built by Acquest-New Jersey, a subsidiary of Acquest Realty Advisors, a development, management and advisory company in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., together with Zeiger Enterprises of Trenton. The hotel will be owned by the private, nonprofit Lafayette Yard Community Development Corporation, which was set up to sell the $31 million in tax-exempt bonds and whose directors include city and community leaders.</p>
        <p>Alan Mallach, the development corporation's chairman, said that the city had stayed the course because ''giving up on the hotel was giving up on the future of downtown Trenton.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mallach, a former director of housing and economic development for Trenton, said that the city had guaranteed the bonds because ''the choice was to wait for the project to happen through the private sector, or have the city prime the pump.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Palmer said that ''it was a risk worth taking.''</p>
        <p>John A. Fox, a senior vice president at PKF Consulting, a real estate and hotel consulting firm in Manhattan, said that financing new full-service hotels is difficult, particularly in downtown urban locations, despite a still strong lodging market and a shortage of such hotels. Among the reasons, he said, are rising interest rates and increasing construction costs.</p>
        <p>That combination, said Robert Bowers, a vice president at Smith Travel Research in Hendersonville, Tenn., is even more difficult with full-service hotels. Such hotels, he said, have meeting rooms, restaurants and shops, and are more expensive to build than are lodgings without those amenities, such as limited-service hotels, which have been driving new construction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bowers's company reported that of the 3,393 hotels built nationally from January 1998 to April 2000, only 335 were full-service hotels. Only one of the 38 hotels built in New Jersey during the same period, the Meadowlands Plaza Hotel in Secaucus, was a full-service lodging, according to Smith Travel Research.</p>
        <p>''So unless developers can secure below-market financing or obtain public subsidies,'' Mr. Fox said, ''the numbers often don't pencil out.'' Bond-based financing is becoming a more prevalent way to finance such hotels, he said.</p>
        <p>In the case of the more than $46 million Trenton hotel, which at times seemed would never be built, the financing evolved in three stages, with the city's involvement increasing at each stage, said Robert Powell, a  managing director at Nassau Capital Advisors in Princeton, which represented the city in the project.</p>
        <p>FROM the start the state committed $8.175 million in loans to the project, he said; the city contributed the land as well as $7.25 million in subsidies. Despite the public money, a healthy hotel market and a commitment from Marriott, the developers tried unsuccessfully through mid-1998 to raise the remaining money. ''The projected return on the private investment was not high enough to justify what was perceived to be a risky investment in Trenton's untested market,'' Mr. Powell said.</p>
        <p>Early in 1999 the focus shifted to public financing and to the creation of the nonprofit development corporation to issue $31 million in tax-exempt bonds, backed by the project. But it took until last November to structure the deal and turn the state's $8.175 million loan commitment into actual funds, Mr. Powell said, adding that by then interest rates had reached 8.5 percent -- based on the bonds' unrated status, and the market's weak appetite for high-yield bonds -- rendering the project financially unfeasible.</p>
        <p>The solution was to get the city to guarantee the bonds, a move the mayor and the City Council agreed to. The six-member Council approved the guarantee by a vote of 5 to 1. Doing so increased the rating of the bonds and lowered the interest rate to 5.7 percent, which made the project more economically viable by reducing the debt service on the bonds from an average of $2.6 million a year to $2.1 million, Mr. Powell said. That lowered the break-even occupancy rate for the hotel to 60 percent from 70 percent, which he said gave city officials the assurance they needed to back the bonds.</p>
        <p>Also comforting, he said, was a $2.1 million reserve fund -- part of the $31 million bond issue -- the city could tap, if necessary, to pay the debt service on the hotel. In addition, any profit from the hotel -- Marriott receives a management fee -- flows back to the city, Mr. Powell said.</p>
        <p>The commitment of the city and state to the project and to transforming Trenton into a tourist destination is what persuaded Marriott to remain involved, said Terry Harwood, the vice president and general manager of Marriott Conference Centers. Mr. Harwood said that his company, which runs several lodgings in central New Jersey, including a full-service hotel in nearby Princeton, also concluded there was a market for the project in Trenton.</p>
        <p>According to Smith Travel Research, the hotel occupancy rate in the area around Trenton, which has 46 lodgings with 4,700 rooms, was 69.7 percent in the 12 months ended in April, a figure relatively unchanged from 1999. The average daily room rate, according to Smith Travel Research, rose 5.5 percent, to $102.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harwood said that 15,000 to 19,000 guests yearly at the Princeton Marriott ''are coming out of Trenton and would stay in downtown Trenton'' if it had a hotel. He said that the Princeton hotel has an average occupancy rate of 80 percent and a turnaway rate of 5 percent.</p>
        <p>The main business for the Trenton hotel, Mr. Harwood said, will be conferences, which are projected to account for 70 to 75 percent of its occupancy, compared with 40 percent at many other hotels. The 10,000 square feet of meeting space planned at the hotel will be added to the 5,000 square feet of such space as well as the 1,900-seat amphitheater at the War Memorial, which Marriott will market and manage.</p>
        <p>The hotel has been designed to blend with its neighbor. The architects are Ford Farewell Mills and Gatsch, and Johnson Jones,  both of Princeton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harwood said that the balance of the business at the hotel, which will have a 120-seat restaurant, will be from business and leisure travelers. He said that room rates are expected to be at least $5 a night lower than those at his company's Princeton hotel, where daily rates range from $150 to $170.</p>
        <p>The challenge ahead, said Mr. Mallach of the development corporation, is to draw  other commercial and retail projects downtown, including restaurants and offices, and to link the hotel with the arena and baseball stadium and existing historic attractions.</p>
        <p>To that end, the hotel is being made the centerpiece of a Heritage Tourism master plan being advanced by the city and Mercer County. The plan seeks to promote historic sites in Trenton and the surrounding area, including the Old Barracks, the Trenton Battle Monument and the Princeton Battlefield.</p>
        <p>''The hotel in and of itself is not the answer to turning Trenton into a destination,'' Mayor Palmer said. ''The plan now is to take advantage of the city's location and history.''</p>
