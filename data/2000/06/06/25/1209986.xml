        <p>Blaine Harden's article (June 4) came just one week after I returned from my fourth trip to Nairobi. After reading it, I realized that I, too, have struggled with what to tell people regarding this country that I love so much. Do I tell of my amazing visits, of the people and places that have so inspired me, in the hope that more tourists will make the trip and revive the economy once again? Or do I ''expose'' the reality of the poverty and decline of Kenya, with the idea that if enough people hear about it, something may be done? I have never come up with a satisfying answer. I just hope that I never get ''out of the sun,'' as Harden writes so bitterly, and give up on ever seeing a prosperous, healthy Kenya.</p>
