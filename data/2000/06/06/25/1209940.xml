        <p>PIECE by piece my body is being plundered by time. ''Wear and tear in exchange for experience and wisdom'' is my mother's reasoned thinking about the physical changes that accompany aging. And while I accept this with relative ease, I dispute the equation vigorously when it comes to teeth.</p>
        <p>Blessed with good genes, many people I know smile at themselves in their bathroom mirrors and see reflections of the same pebbly whites that broke through their swollen 6-year-old gums five decades before. They are like the teeth excavated by archaeologists that bit and chewed long before the toothbrush was invented, teeth so rich with detail they tell stories about culture right down to what, once upon a time, constituted an evening's meal.</p>
        <p>These teeth -- eternity makers, I call them -- outlive their owners by centuries. They are the kind of teeth I wish I had.</p>
        <p>I grew up before water was fluoridated, when floss was considered esoteric, and pain-free dentistry was oxymoronic. A candy lover and a sloppy brusher, I spent lots of after-school time at the dentist's office, inhaling the clove-scented air and getting my teeth drilled. Those cavities, mini-mines of mercury silver amalgam, generated much income for my dentist, whose own smile needed some serious attending to.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, I never cottoned to Dr. Levine and his fake cheeriness. But I did grow to love Hannah, his dental assistant, a rosy-cheeked woman who wore a stiff nurse's cap and rubber-soled shoes that squeaked against the high-gloss floor.</p>
        <p>''You'll do better next checkup,'' she would say reassuringly as she dabbed my welling eyes and let me grip her ringed fingers as the dentist drilled. She inspired me to tell my junior high school yearbook editor that my professional goal was to someday become an oral hygienist.</p>
        <p>On the cusp of puberty, with barely any white enamel surface left to fill, I moved to the next tier of dental care, orthodonture.</p>
        <p>My buck-toothed smile, the result, I was told, of shameless round-the-clock thumb sucking, would undergo six years of restructuring. In the end I would chew more efficiently, and in the bargain, gain a winning smile.</p>
        <p>My appointments for appliance adjustments were scheduled on Fridays, after school, so that weekends often began with dull throbbing pain and lots of aspirin.</p>
        <p>One particular November afternoon, everything seemed in its place -- the gurgling fishtank, the Highlights magazines strewn all over the floor and the wall hangings, artwork signed by the orthodontist's wife. Instead of the usual Muzak, however, there was talk, solemn and urgent.</p>
        <p>''President Kennedy is dead; we repeat, President Kennedy is dead,''  I heard. The receptionist sobbed and the phone rang and rang unanswered. Death and dentistry became entwined, forever cemented.</p>
        <p>MY grandmother's teeth were gone long before her death at 93. She wore dentures, lookalikes of the souvenir wind-up chatterers I had won at a carnival.</p>
        <p>Each night she soaked them in a glass of water perched atop her night table, a sunken treasure of pink and pearls. Before sliding them in each morning, she looked pinched and puckered, her tongue like a lost horse searching for its corral. But she accepted her toothless fate good-naturedly, rarely complaining about her diet of easy-to-swallow, baby-foodlike concoctions -- soups, custards and overcooked pasta.</p>
        <p>Spring, with its holiday barbecues, presented the exception. It was the time of year when she watched us enviously as we ate our blackened meats to the bone and husks of corn on the cob bare.</p>
        <p>''There is God in those kernels,''  she would say, lingering over spoonfuls of mashed potatoes, forcing us to think about the impact and end of simple pleasures.</p>
        <p>My sister, a Bavarian pretzel eater, someone who goes for the toothsome and crunchy, recently had a permanent molar removed because of disease that had descended into her jawbone. This ominous reminder has pushed to full-throttle my small-scale war on plaque, gingivitis, tartar and other Madison Avenue-fueled teeth enemies.</p>
        <p>I own a top-of-the-line electric toothbrush, a WaterPik and an arsenal of toothpastes so varied, they crowd the shelves of my sizable medicine cabinet. To stymie the periodontal disease that has wreaked  havoc on my ascending gumline, I undergo two extra cleanings a year.</p>
        <p>And while I am loath to admit it, I floss in my rearview mirror while waiting for traffic lights to turn green. It is my vain attempt to keep a part of me going long after I am gone.</p>
