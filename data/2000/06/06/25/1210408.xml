        <p>Dad works hard at an auto repair shop. In his off hours, he and his oldest son head for the neighborhood gym where they're training the middle son, a boxer with a shot at the championship. The youngest son is a pre-med student at U.C.L.A. The older daughter works as a paralegal at a Beverly Hills firm. The younger daughter is in high school and has been hanging out with the wrong crowd. Their dead mother's sister, who lives across the street, owns a beauty salon and spends a lot of time with the family, which also includes a brain-damaged uncle.</p>
        <p>Their names are Roberto, Miguel, Carlos, Alex, Yolanda, Victoria, Bibi and Ruben. They are the Santiagos, a Mexican-American family living in a beige shingled house in East Los Angeles. And the new drama on which they appear -- ''Resurrection Boulevard,'' which has its two-hour premiere tomorrow night at 10 on Showtime -- may be this country's first television series to focus on a Latino family. Ever.</p>
        <p>''It could have been an Irish family in Boston or a Lithuanian family in Atlanta,'' said Dennis E. Leoni, the creator and co-executive producer of the show. ''It's about a working-class family trying to get a piece of the American dream.'' Still, it is important that this show focuses on Latinos, he said, because, despite the vast Hispanic population in the United States, television has barely acknowledged that they exist.</p>
        <p>Oh, there was Victor Sifuentes (Jimmy Smits), the sexy young lawyer on ''L.A. Law''; Don Johnson's boss on one police show (Edward James Olmos, ''Miami Vice'') and partner on another (Cheech Marin, ''Nash Bridges''); and, more than 20 years ago, Freddie Prinze's ''Chico and the Man'' character, a mechanic who lived in a truck. Otherwise, when Latinos have appeared in series or television movies, they have tended to be secondary characters, in some cases the household help.</p>
        <p>''People in America think of us in those terms,'' said Mr. Leoni, who grew up in Phoenix (his ancestors came from the same area, thank you; the Gadsden Purchase in 1853 turned their part of northern Mexico into southern Arizona). ''Network executives are very wealthy, usually Anglo males. When they develop shows, they don't have the sensibilities to see us as anything but maids and gardeners.''</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Pena, who plays Bibi on ''Resurrection Boulevard,'' has been cast as a maid twice: in the film ''Down and Out in Beverly Hills'' and on the short-lived sitcom ''I Married Dora.'' At other times she has portrayed a teacher (in John Sayles's film ''Lone Star''), a spy, a marine biologist, a postal worker, a waitress and a bomb- disposal expert. She knows sh is one of the lucky ones and is pleased that Showtime is doing a Latino series.</p>
        <p>''It's never happened, to my knowledge, in the history of American television,'' said Ms. Pena, who grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, adding that it was rewarding to work at last with so many people ''of the same culture as you.''</p>
        <p>Asked what language was used on the set, she said: ''We all speak English to each other, but the minute you have a one-on-one with somebody, you switch. My brain starts to think in Spanish.'' The script throws in a phrase now and then for flavor, but Anglo viewers with a semester of high school Spanish will be able to understand the likes of ''Comprendo todo,'' ''Porque no?'' and ''Te quiero.''</p>
        <p>Many people behind the scenes of ''Resurrection Boulevard'' are Hispanic as well. Jesus Salvador Trevino directed, for instance, and the costumes are by Sylvia Vega Vasquez.</p>
        <p>''A Latino can give a more honest portrayal of what the reality is,'' said Mr. Leoni, who also wrote the series premiere. ''An Anglo producer,'' he believes, ''would be more worried about being politically correct and not offending anyone.'' He has already taken some heat, he adds, because the series shows a criminal element in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''I'm trying to do a realistic series,'' he said. ''You have your good guys, you have your bad guys, and they're all Latino.''</p>
