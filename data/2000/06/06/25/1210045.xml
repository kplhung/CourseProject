        <p>ONE is a sound engineer with his own studio in Manhattan who just signed a contract with Disney for the use of a song he wrote for the show ''Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.'' Another received an Emmy Award last month for a PBS documentary series, ''The Souls of New York.'' Another was the first cameraman/ steadicam operator for the film ''Titanic.'' Another produced the first season of ''Once and Again'' for ABC in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>They are among the 160 former students, now playwrights, creative directors, publicists, choreographers, set designers, film editors, actors, teachers, lawyers and doctors, who gathered in Manhattan on June 9 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Student Television Arts Company of Herricks High School in New Hyde Park.</p>
        <p>Conceived and run by Ron DeMaio, STAC is the first and only program on Long Island to offer a school within a school that devotes the last third of the school day to enhancing skills in art, dance, drama, music, voice and writing. Thirty-six students from grades 9 through 12, selected by audition before an independent panel of professional artists, choose to give up lunch, free periods and electives to participate.</p>
        <p>But those who have been part of the program said it had done far more than merely develop arts skills.</p>
        <p>''Our goal in 1980 was to create a program that used the arts as a vehicle to develop human beings with a real respect for learning,'' said Charlotte Podolsky, former director of pupil personnel services of the Herricks school district. ''The result after two decades is 346 independent thinkers who are not afraid to march to their own drummer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. DeMaio said: ''The program is unique in that all the arts work together to write, direct, film and edit original video productions. We hire staff outside the district five times a year for four sessions in each discipline, but the rest of the time we're problem-solving, collaborating and improvising. We learn about being generous. What we unlearn is that mistakes are bad. By supplying a safety net of support, kids learn that no matter what you do, nobody's going to laugh.''</p>
        <p>''I use everything I learned in STAC every day,'' said Kristina Testani, a 1988 graduate who studied art in the program. ''Working with a special-needs preschool population in Whitestone, my goal is to be what Mr. DeMaio is: a firm but kind, structured yet flexible, endlessly creative and energetic teacher.''</p>
        <p>The program was federally funded for its first four years, until the Herricks school district took over. The music videos, soundtracks, documentaries, and experimental videos produced through the years have earned the program more than a dozen national awards from such organizations as the American Film Institute, the Florida Department of Citrus, the San Francisco Science Exploration Festival and PBS.</p>
        <p>Keri Kravitz Weisblum, now a post-production supervisor in the film industry, studied dance for four years. ''Spending two hours a day learning to appreciate the arts taught me more about creative problem solving, more about skills applicable in everyday life, than any other part of high school.''</p>
        <p>Almost 65 percent of the program's graduates found a career in a related field. Several women have become film editors and gaffers, jobs that until recently were overwhelmingly male. Having New York City nearby exposed them to all the possibilities.</p>
        <p>''I was only 14 and totally unfamiliar with Manhattan before STAC,'' said Brent Nemetz, now a 26-year-old Emmy winner. ''We had the opportunity to take advantage of going to museums, dances, plays, sometimes once or twice a week. Mr. DeMaio made himself available and accessible beyond the school day, getting us inexpensive tickets and arranging for us to meet many of the casts after the performance. How can you put any kind of payback on what he gave us?''</p>
        <p>Despite the stereotype of artists as temperamental and selfish, the former Herricks students said STAC promoted just the opposite values.</p>
        <p>''I don't remember one fight, one problem we couldn't work out,'' said Donna Levy, an event coordinator working for a corporate concierge service.</p>
        <p>For years the arts have been considered a frill for public education, nowhere near as important as advanced courses in science and math. Those with dreams of pursuing the arts were encouraged to do so outside the school environment. There is some evidence that this is changing. The State University of New York has for the first time passed a core curriculum that includes an arts requirement.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeMaio said the confidence and selflessness instilled by the program extended far beyond high school. ''I've heard stories where kids have met on the job, say in California, and after a few hours of noticing how well they seem to understand each other, one asks, 'were you in STAC?' It's a kind of language, a connecting to creativity, a celebration of working noncompetitively in harmony that they're sensing. What you hope to instill is the confidence that comes when you actually feel just how talented you are.''</p>
