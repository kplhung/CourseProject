        <p>AS more baby boomers creep into middle age and forget where they put their glasses, keeping the brain sharp and functioning is taking on a new urgency.

        <p>The cardinal rule of brain exercise is similar to any other muscle in the body: use it or lose it. The brain works by an electrochemical process in which information, including memory, is passed through billions of dendrites, which are extensions of neuron cells (like the branches of a tree). If not used, dendrites can atrophy; but when the brain is used in new and creative ways, dendrite connections remain active, and allow information to pass through. And new dendrites can be created even when neuron cells die with aging.</p>

        <p>AS more baby boomers creep into middle age and forget where they put their glasses, keeping the brain sharp and functioning is taking on a new urgency. Fortunately, there are ways to maintain a nimble mind, reduce the effects of aging on the brain and ensure that the little hamster runs around the wheel at a healthy pace.</p>
        <p>The cardinal rule of brain exercise is similar to any other muscle in the body: use it or lose it. The brain works by an electrochemical process in which information, including memory, is passed through billions of dendrites, which are extensions of neuron cells (like the branches of a tree). If not used, dendrites can atrophy; but when the brain is used in new and creative ways, dendrite connections remain active, and allow information to pass through. And new dendrites can be created even when neuron cells die with aging.</p>
        <p>Experts say there are many ways to buff up and make more dendrites -- from carrying out everyday functions with a twist, like brushing your teeth with your weak hand, to learning a musical instrument or a foreign language. And then there are good old-fashioned brain teasers.</p>
        <p>''Riddles and puzzles are a very conscious effort to generate new connections, which is also a good way to strengthen dormant pathways,'' said Dr. Lawrence Katz, a professor of neurobiology at Duke University in Durham, N.C. Taking in new information and having to apply memory in new ways is the mental equivalent of a tae bo workout.</p>
        <p>The following riddles, culled from Web sites, are one way to put the brain through its paces.</p>
        <p>A. Consider a road with two cars 100 miles apart. They start driving toward each other at the same time. The car on the left moves at a speed of 40 miles per hour, and the car on the right at 60 miles per hour. A bird starts at the same location as the car on the right and flies at a speed of 80 miles per hour. When it reaches the car on the left it reverses direction, and when it reaches the car on the right it reverses again, repeating the pattern until the cars meet. What is the total distance that the bird has traveled at the moment that the two cars reach each other?</p>
        <p>B. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 must be put in the square at right so that the sums of the numbers in each row, column and diagonal are equal. How should the numbers be arranged in the square?</p>
        <p>C. A 16-foot-long cable hangs between two pillars that are both 15 feet high. The cable ends are attached to the tops of the pillars. At its lowest point, the cable hangs 7 feet above the ground. How far apart are the two pillars?</p>
        <p>D.  Fill in the blanks:</p>
        <p>A E F H I K L M -- -- -- W X Y Z</p>
        <p>E. In two different towns, two strangers build similar apartment buildings. They both forget an important part of their project. By chance, they both call the same supply company to order the missing items. They are given the following prices:</p>
        <p>1 will cost $2.</p>
        <p>2 will cost $2.</p>
        <p>12 will cost $4.</p>
        <p>144 will cost $6.</p>
        <p>What was the item they needed?</p>
        <p>F. A king who loves chess decides to retire. He tells his three sons: ''I will give my kingdom to one of you on one condition -- you must spend exactly half your remaining days playing chess.'' Two sons say there is no way to know how long they will live. The third accepts the challenge. How can he fulfill his father's wishes?</p>
        <p>G. What occurs once in a second, once in a minute, twice in a millennium, but never in the course of a lifetime?</p>
