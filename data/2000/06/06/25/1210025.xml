        <p>The Travel section receives hundreds of letters from readers about their experiences with airline travel. Although most write to complain, a small number actually offer words of praise. Here is a selection from the last year:</p>
        <p>To the Editor: My wife and 6-year-old daughter were recently bumped from a Continental flight from Flint, Mich., to Newark. They were given $14 lunch money and put in a filthy van for a two-hour trip to Detroit to catch the next flight to Newark. On the way, the van driver decided to have breakfast; my wife and daughter sat in a McDonald's lot while he ate.</p>

        <p>The response from the Continental service representative was, ''Well, we got them to Newark, so what's the problem?''</p>
        <p>SAMUEL PARAB  Princeton, N.J.</p>
        <p>(Mr. Parab later was sent two $200 round-trip vouchers.)</p>
        <p>Catherine Stengel, manager of public relations for Continental, replies: We apologize that the expectations of our customers weren't met. Continental is reviewing the service we provided, and establishing procedures that will allow us to continue to improve service to our customers.</p>
