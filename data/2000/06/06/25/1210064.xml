        <p>EUGENE O'NEILL'S father, James O'Neill, liked to say that the map of Ireland was written all over his son's face. A map of early 20th-century New London, however, can be traced in many of his best plays. Now, New London, once home to O'Neill, is celebrating the playwright with ''Eugene O'Neill's New London: The Influence of Time and Place.''</p>
        <p>The Arts Alliance of Southeastern Connecticut and Connecticut College is sponsoring the celebration, a series of symposiums, lectures, performances and exhibitions that opened in late April and continues through October.</p>
        <p>''The project explores O'Neill's life in New London from 1885-1915,'' said Robert A. Richter, a Connecticut College professor who will lecture on ''Eugene O'Neill's Maritime Years''  on July 5 at Connecticut College's downtown campus. ''The idea to honor O'Neill started percolating two years ago at the Monte Cristo Cottage,'' Mr. Richter said, ''and it seemed the new millennium was a good time to do so.''</p>
        <p>Appreciation of O'Neill (1888-1953) in his hometown has come a long way. In the mid-70's the mayor of New London wondered why a group of citizens wanted to re-name Main Street after ''a stew-bum'' who ''wrote a few books.'' The sad truth was that the assessment wasn't far off, since O'Neill, along with his older brother Jamie, showed more talent for debauchery than writing. Yet it was this period of his life that supplied the characters and action of ''Long Day's Journey into Night,'' ''Moon for the Misbegotten'' and his only comedy, ''Ah, Wilderness!''</p>
        <p>''New London was probably the greatest influence of his life,'' said Barbara Gelb, who with her husband, Arthur Gelb, recently published the first of a three-volume biography titled ''O'Neill'' (Applause Books). The biography is a revision of the couple's 1962 book of the same name. ''It was the only real home he had,'' Mrs. Gelb said. ''Since all of his plays were autobiographical, New London was very important.'</p>
        <p>O'Neill, America's only Nobel Prize-winning playwright, was born in New York City. His father was an actor-manager known for playing the title role in the ''Count of Monte Cristo'' for most of his career.</p>
        <p>James O'Neill bought the family's first house on Pequot Avenue in New London in 1884 as a summer home for his wife, Ella, and their young son Jamie. Since the family trouped across the country with James, it was the only place where the family stood still for very long.</p>
        <p>''Ah, Wilderness!'' imagines the family life that O'Neill said he had wished for while ''Long Day's Journey'' depicts a version of the family undermined by alcoholism, drug addiction and self-destruction.</p>
        <p>''People knew of the boys' exploits, but not to the extent that 'Long Day's Journey' shows,'' said Sally Pavetti, curator of the Monte Cristo Cottage, a landmark owned by the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford. ''Nobody knew of Ella's addiction or the other terrors the family knew.''</p>
        <p>The Monte Cristo Cottage, of course, plays a prominent role in the O'Neill celebration. There the Playwrights Theater of New York will perform the ''Eugene O'Neill Ragtime Revue'' on July 16 and the premiere of an early work, ''Personal Equation,'' in August.</p>
        <p>Other highlights of the O'Neill series include the following programs.</p>
        <p>Scenes from ''Ah, Wilderness!'' and ''Long Day's Journey Into Night'' will be performed by a local theater group on Wednesday at 12:30 p.m. The free performance takes place at Connecticut College Downtown, 305 State Street.</p>
        <p>Morgan McGinley, whose Uncle Art was the prototype for O'Neill's father figure Nat Miller in ''Ah, Wilderness!'' will deliver a lecture on the play on Thursday at 4 p.m. at Tansill Black Box Theater at Connecticut College.</p>
        <p>The Groton Regional Theater's fully-staged production of ''Ah, Wilderness!'' (which is part of the International Festival of Arts and Ideas) will be given from Thursday through July 1 at the Tansill Black Box Theater, and ''The Hairy Ape'' will be presented by the Flock Theater on July 5, 8, 12 and 15.</p>
        <p>The number to call for further information about ''Eugene O'Neill's New London: The Influence of Time and Place'' is (860) 439-ARTS.</p>
