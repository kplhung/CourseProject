        <p>CORN cushions. My best friend and I are having a spirited conversation about corn cushions. A comparative colloquy, really, in which the merits of various corn interdiction and removal technologies are argued with the same conviction one might bring to a debate over Kurdish separatism or the latest papal encyclical.</p>
        <p>Tempers flare. We brandish corn cushion packaging at each other, theatrical and accusatory, like prosecutors at the thrill-killing trial of Dr. Scholl. Gelpac? Closed-cell foam? We go on this way for several minutes. Harsh words are spoken and tootsies unshoed. It is Darrow versus Bryan. Bryan versus Darrow. Bryant versus Katie and Matt. About corns.</p>

        <p>CORN cushions. My best friend and I are having a spirited conversation about corn cushions. A comparative colloquy, really, in which the merits of various corn interdiction and removal technologies are argued with the same conviction one might bring to a debate over Kurdish separatism or the latest papal encyclical.</p>
        <p>Tempers flare. We brandish corn cushion packaging at each other, theatrical and accusatory, like prosecutors at the thrill-killing trial of Dr. Scholl. Gelpac? Closed-cell foam? We go on this way for several minutes. Harsh words are spoken and tootsies unshoed. It is Darrow versus Bryan. Bryan versus Darrow. Bryant versus Katie and Matt. About corns.</p>
        <p>Conversations like these are impossible to explain to anyone under 40. To anyone over 40, no explanation is necessary.</p>
        <p>I am 42. My bunioned friend is 42. And we can feel AARP fairly breathing, or at least wheezing, down our necks.</p>
        <p>My G.P., ''Dr. Opie,'' a young man who still fidgets and fusses in his grown-up doctor coat like a panicked understudy in a career-day production of ''H.M.O.: the Musical!'' informed me recently that I am in  ''generally good health, considering.'' Considering, I suppose, the smoking and the drinking, and the fact that I eat like an 8-year-old on his first day at the state fair.</p>
        <p>Opie is right, of course, and I'm genuinely thankful (so is he, I suppose) that I have no serious illnesses. Rather, I am a dubious catalog of small infirmities, a high-mileage 40-something who totals his health in the sum of his small hurts, oxidizing body parts and inglorious persistent ''conditions.'' Caesars and their epic stories are made on the front lines, however, not in the quartermaster corps, so he and I are left to talk small about the creeping ravages of maturity.</p>
        <p>ME  My toenails are getting thicker.</p>
        <p>OPIE  (donning latex glove with a dramatic snap) That'll happen.</p>
        <p>ME  I mean really thick, like they're hooves or something. . . .</p>
        <p>OPIE  (elaborately adjusting fit of same) Mm. . . .</p>
        <p>ME  . . . like the scales on an allosaurus.</p>
        <p>OPIE  (looking at his index finger with resignation) Don't worry about it, you're lucky to have such minor complaints. O.K., just relax. You'll feel some pressure now. There! You're just getting old is all. (Laughing.)</p>
        <p>ME  Oh. (The opposite of laughing.)</p>
        <p>Opie is thus a real optimist when it comes to my entropic, slo-mo collapse into geezerhood. So is my girlfriend. She is about Opie's age, as healthy and strong as a Clydesdale. Her advice regarding my progressive decay into a twilight life of slipper socks and cardigans is to ''suck it up.''</p>
        <p>It's not that they're unsympathetic; it's just that they've bought into the idea that aging and death can be conquered by science and four-color magazine photos. The fantasy of our new middle age is the abdominal showman on the cover of Men's Health magazine. Sure he looks great, with his tiny gym shorts and expensive pectoral implants, but that's how he earns his living. Doing situps is his job! Where's the nobility in a struggle against peak-hour crowding at Club Reebok?</p>
        <p>A hock-to-head self-inventory of those things about which Opie instructs me to feel lucky reveals, I think, the awkward, unretouched reality of an average man waging an average fight against his own decline.</p>
        <p>The corns and toenails you know about. The ankles above them, like airline cocktails, are alternately too stiff or not stiff enough. I know that one day, perhaps at a curb, they will betray me. The bony knees have each exploded on several occasions, the most recent detonation occurring during a pickup hockey game in which an ex-Ranger faked me out of my own patella.</p>
        <p>My orthopedic surgeon, whom I met several hours later, has children in college. He now encourages me to play hockey more often, as tuition is trending up. When I get up in the morning, my knee joints sound as if someone is making a fresh batch of microwave popcorn. Don't ask me to dance.</p>
        <p>FARTHER north are the devious and unreliable bowels, the shrinking bladder, the suddenly delicate stomach and the parts about which the less said the better. Sure, they can manufacture pills for some of these problems, but when will medicine deliver a really safe, effective burrito?  My hips hurt, my heart doesn't always beat right, my shoulders won't work before 10 or after 6, and on wet mornings my hands feel as if they've been dipped in papier-mache.</p>
        <p>My neck makes noises like an antique oven hinge, I can't read fine print anymore, and my dentist schedules his vacations around my calendar of multiple root canals. I don't sleep, I get bad headaches sometimes, and my memory is now limited to sitcom theme songs of the 1970's and a not-very-good recipe for banana bread.</p>
        <p>I have fallen off, onto and through too  many things. I have gone faster than conditions permit. I have been burned and cut and kissed. I exercise too much and not enough. I ache. I bruise like a peach. I have eaten poorly and loved badly and neither exfoliate nor rehydrate on a regular basis.</p>
        <p>This strikes me as a noble, if not heroic, struggle, and reflects, I guess, ''generally good health, considering.'' Everyone, everywhere has to fight the same fight. And what can any of us do but breathe out and relax? Or, better still, suck it up? We're just getting old, is all.</p>
