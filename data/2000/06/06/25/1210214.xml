        <p>Talk about a velvet revolution. For a new generation of Eastern European transplants to New York, Soviet-era establishments like Kiev, Veselka and the 10th Street Baths are being supplanted by a new brand of pop-cultural action that is about more than borscht and pirogies.</p>

        <p>Talk about a velvet revolution. For a new generation of Eastern European transplants to New York, Soviet-era establishments like Kiev, Veselka and the 10th Street Baths are being supplanted by a new brand of pop-cultural action that is about more than borscht and pirogies.</p>
        <p>Mehanata (the name means little tavern) is a Bulgarian restaurant-bar-disco, above right, on Canal and Broadway with Thursday night ''Gogol Bordello'' dance frenzies, where young and old Russians, Ukrainians and Bulgarians mix with models, artists, dot-com kids and Chloe Sevigny, who dropped by recently.</p>
        <p>''There is no gimmick to it,'' said Eugene Hutz, 27, who gives the party. ''The idea is to let loose and taste some life energy. It's a different culture in motion.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hutz -- a D.J., model, and lead singer of a Ukrainian punk band, Gogol Bordello -- plays Russian, Ukrainian and Gypsy songs, as well as Arabic and Spanish music and Euro hits from the 70's and 80's. On the dance floor, people do kicks and jump like Cossacks, swirl Ukrainian style, whistle and break plates.</p>
        <p>For those who prefer a quieter atmosphere, there's the Russian Vodka Room, top left, at 265 West 52nd Street, where 63 kinds of vodka flow from heart-shaped carafes and Russian waitresses clad in black leather halter-tops serve gravlax and potato pancakes. During happy hour, from 4 to 7 p.m., one might run into the members of Squirrel Nut Zippers or David Letterman's music director, Paul Shaffer.</p>
        <p>Anyway Cafe in the East Village attracts artsy Russian expatriots and cinema lovers coming from the Anthology Film Archives across the street to drink vodka and listen to Russian accordion music on Thursdays, jazz on Fridays and Saturdays, and Gypsy music on Sundays.</p>
        <p>After drinking too much vodka, the place to sweat out the toxins is the Wall Street Bath &amp; Spa, below, on Fulton Street, a new Russian bania, or bathhouse. Pavel Ananiev, its manager, said it is frequented by Sharon Stone, Q-Tip and Leonardo DiCaprio, who walks around with a towel on his head like the Orthodox Jewish patrons, who keep their heads covered for religious reasons. The bathhouse has Russian, Turkish and Swedish steam rooms, massage rooms, a swimming pool and a cold-water dip, a juice bar with palm trees and a restaurant serving Russian food. Daily admission is $26; yearly membership is $975.</p>
