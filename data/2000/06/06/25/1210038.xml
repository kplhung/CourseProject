        <p>Article on quick spread of rumor, via Internet, that Department of Transportation plans to build bridge from Rye to Oyster Bay, Long Island; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Did you hear? The Department of Transportation is finally building that bridge from Rye to Oyster Bay. I know because some neighbors told me. They saw it on the Internet. They heard about it in the supermarket. Work crews are widening a road to accommodate it. There is even a photograph of it.</p>
        <p>According to Nicholas DiFonzo, associate professor of psychology at the Rochester Institute of Technology and an expert on rumors, that is exactly how rumors spread: A seed of truth (there was once talk of such a bridge), an instigating occurrence (a proposal to widen West Shore Road in Oyster Bay), a mistrusted source (the Department of Transportation), false information (a Web site posted incorrect information).</p>

        <p>Did you hear? The Department of Transportation is finally building that bridge from Rye to Oyster Bay. I know because some neighbors told me. They saw it on the Internet. They heard about it in the supermarket. Work crews are widening a road to accommodate it. There is even a photograph of it.</p>
        <p>According to Nicholas DiFonzo, associate professor of psychology at the Rochester Institute of Technology and an expert on rumors, that is exactly how rumors spread: A seed of truth (there was once talk of such a bridge), an instigating occurrence (a proposal to widen West Shore Road in Oyster Bay), a mistrusted source (the Department of Transportation), false information (a Web site posted incorrect information).</p>
        <p>And that photo? It is a bridge in Florida -- what the Sound bridge might look like if were being seriously considered. Or considered at all.</p>
        <p>Rumor is improvised news possessing a degree of uncertainty. People speculate. The rumor then becomes information that is passed around, or as Professor DiFonzo explains, ''The group tries to figure out what the truth is.</p>
        <p>Enter another important element in the genesis of a rumor: the trusted source who quells the panic, the one who moves the discourse away from the unverified information to a valid fact that has secure standards of evidence. In this case the trusted source was N. J. Burkett, a WABC news correspondent and friend of a self-confessed (yet unsuspecting) rumor-monger.</p>
        <p>The tale goes like this: Pat Santelli, an industrial-advertising saleswoman and resident of Oyster Bay Cove, an enclave of multimillion dollar homes, recently began training for a charity run with her friend Cindy Bogart. During a powerwalk, they began talking about the widening of West Shore Road, an abomination to their friends and to the West Shore Road Committee.</p>
        <p>One day Ms. Bogart informed Ms. Santelli that she had come across a Web site, www .nycroads.com, that touted itself as ''the complete guide to New York area roads, crossings and exits.'' It was extensive and official-looking, and said the Sound bridge was being considered again. There on the page labeled ''The Unbuilt,'' was a beautiful color photo of the dreaded 6.1-mile span.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bogart panicked, and soon all her neighbors began to get excited.</p>
        <p>''This is a very, very wealthy area with very well educated, very powerful and very business-savvy population,'' Ms. Santelli said, ''and everyone was starting to panic.''</p>
        <p>At local watering holes and stores, people began talking about the bridge as a fait accompli. ''Part of the problem was that we thought that the easement was the beginning of the bridge-building process,'' Ms. Santelli said, ''but we were also concerned that Charles Wang, who lives in Cove Neck, bought up 50 additional properties in the area. What's his master plan? There was a lot of paranoia in the air.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wang is chairman and chief executive of Computer Associates.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bogart said: ''A lot of things were conspiring together. What was Computer Associates doing buying up whatever they could in the area? They have bought up between 40 and 60 properties. It's a known fact.''</p>
        <p>Seeing the Web site ''was the icing on the cake,'' Ms. Santelli said. At the area's recent Memorial Day parade, the West Shore Road Committee set up an information table, and discussions began to spread.</p>
        <p>''The West Shore Committee did themselves a disservice,'' Ms. Bogart added, ''by rousing public paranoia when discussing the bridge. Everyone got crazy and thought all this was linked to some diabolical plan.''</p>
        <p>But Peter Lopipero, president of the West Shore Road Committee, said his organization did not rile anyone up. ''We are just concerned about West Shore Road,'' he said. ''And when items like the bridge come up, it breeds paranoia.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Santelli takes some of the blame. She began making calls and was out on late-night missions delivering letters and information from the Web site to people like Rosemary Bourne, head of the Cove Road Civic Association, and Anita MacDougall, wife of the commodore of the Sewanhaka Yacht Club. ''I basically caused a lot of trouble,'' she said with a laugh, ''and then took off for an out-of-town business trip.'' She came home to several E-mails and realized the situation was out of control. So she called someone ''who could get to the bottom of this.''</p>
        <p>Enter Mr. Burkett, of WABC, who laughs about how out of control the situation got. ''There was panic in this community of people who are usually quite smart about things like this,'' he recalled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burkett put his reporting skills to work and checked with the Department of Transportation, where a source told him the bridge was no longer under consideration. When the reporter checked out the Web site, which he agreed ''seemed very official,'' he found incorrect information: that a bridge was still being considered.</p>
        <p>Angry, Mr. Burkett contacted Steve Anderson, the site's creator. Mr. Anderson, a hobbyist from Forest Hills who specializes in transportation, did some research and soon toned down some of the language on the extensive site. Mr. Burkett called his friend, Ms. Santelli, and all was put to rest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson, she said, ''should be drawn and quartered -- his misinformation just fed into the paranoia that was overtaking the community.''</p>
        <p>The following day, on the Long Island Rail Road, Mr. Burkett met a friend who lives in the Oyster Bay area and told him the story. When he arrived in his office, Mr. Burkett was greeted by an E-mail from Albert Messina of Huntington, stating, ''I don't usually eavesdrop on the Long Island Rail Road, but . . .''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burkett ''was speaking kind of loud,'' said Mr. Messina, ''and when I heard the name Steve Anderson, it drew my attention. I thought I could help. We went to N.Y.U. business school together and I knew he was a smart guy with a legitimate interest'' in transportation. But by this time the rumor had been quelled.</p>
        <p>Professor DiFonzo says the Oyster Bay case was a ''remarkable testament to the power of the group.'' He particularly liked the railroad eavesdropping, which sort of closed the circle.</p>
        <p>Rumors can serve a purpose, Mr. DiFonzo added, but they can also do harm. In this case, he believes it finally did good by determining the facts and circulation them.</p>
        <p>And Ms. Bogart? ''Now I'm worried about what Computer Associates is up to,'' she said.</p>
