        <p>LOOKING back, Alice Myhal says it was partly the doctor's enthusiasm that helped her decide: she sensed an energy level as high as her own in Dr. Beth Overmoyer, and it struck a chord. But religion had a role, too. Since providence had brought her to Dr. Overmoyer just in time for a new, experimental treatment, she thought she must be meant to try it.</p>
        <p>Then there were the bleak odds for women with her condition, inflammatory breast cancer, an unusually aggressive type of cancer. Even with standard treatment, patients have only a 25 to 45 percent chance of living 5 years. Ms. Myhal, who is 45, hoped for more time. She had a teenage son and daughter, and wanted a chance to see them grow up.</p>
        <p>So in April, Ms. Myhal became part of an experiment at the Ireland Cancer Center at University Hospitals in Cleveland, a clinical trial testing standard chemotherapy combined with SU5416, an anti-angiogenesis drug meant to kill tumors by cutting off their blood supply. Dr. Overmoyer devised the trial, in the hope that adding SU5416 to chemotherapy, followed by surgery and radiation, would boost women's survival. The new drug had been shown to slow the progress of advanced colon cancer, but it had never been given to anyone with inflammatory breast cancer.</p>
        <p>''Somebody has to be first,'' Ms. Myhal said. ''I felt sort of like the women astronauts.''</p>
        <p>She became one of the 40,000 to 45,000 cancer patients in the United States - only 5 percent of all those with cancer - who brave, hopeful and sometimes desperate, participate in clinical trials. These are experiments in which groups of people, ususally matched for age and stage of illness, try a new drug or procedure. More than 600 cancer trials are under way in the United States, as well as several thousand more studies of other diseases.</p>
        <p>The trials usually have three phases, which can be summarized in three questions: Is it safe? Does it work? Is it better than standard treatment?</p>
        <p>Phase I studies, like the one Ms. Myhal entered, are designed to determine whether a new treatment is safe and what is the correct dosage of a drug. Patients may sign up hoping for a cure, but the real mission of Phase I trials is not to measure effectiveness. Not until Phase II are researchers supposed to look for signs that the treatment works. In Phase III, the treatment is compared with a usual therapy, or, if there is none, with a placebo.</p>
        <p>Like Ms. Myhal, many people find their way to clinical trials through their doctors, particularly if they are being treated at major medical centers where research is done. Others use the Internet or call organizations that specialize in referring people to trials.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, President Clinton said that he would sign an executive order requiring Medicare to cover most of the costs of its patients in clinical trials, which should help ease their access to experimental treatments.</p>
        <p>Not everyone can get into a trial, however. Patients usually have to be at the exact stage of illjness speified by the experimental protocol, which are the rules set up to ensure that subjects are similar enough to yield meaningful results. Many trials also need people who have not been treated before, or who have not taken certain drugs that might interfere with the experiment.</p>
        <p>The gold standard in research is the ''random controlled trial,'' in which patients are assigned ramdonly to one treatment group or another, with neither patients nor experimenters told which group is which until the trial is finished.</p>
        <p>Researchers consider clinical trials to be the backbone of medical progress. They are the most reliable way to determine whether a new treatment works and is safe, and they have led to improved therapy for cancer, AIDS, heart disease, asthma, diabetes, mental illness and hundreds of other disorders. Most children with cancer are treated in clinical trials, and cancer experts redit the high cure rates to that practice.</p>
        <p>Dr. Overmoyer, who is the director of clinical trials in breast cancer at the Ireland Center, said that offering clinical trials to patients was an important mission of a major cancer center. ''We like to make sure there's always something new, something investigational, for everyone with breast cancer, because we're not curing everyone,'' she said.</p>
        <p>At a conference on breast cancer in New York this month, Dr. Larry Norton, head of the solid tumor oncology division at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said, ''Every advance we've made is from clinical trials.'' He added that patients in trials often fared better than those not in trials, and he described entering a trial as ''actually a very smart thing for a patient to do.''</p>
        <p>Not all doctors agree. Some, thinking clinical trials use people as guinea pigs and therefore not worth the risks, do not encourage patients to participate. Others want to retain control of patients' treatment themselves.</p>
        <p>For people who take part in studiesk there can be great advantages but also great risks. On the positive side, trials can offer patients hope in the form of a chance to try promising treatments not yet available to the public. That is a powerful lure for people like Ms. Myhal, who have conditions for which the usual treatment does not work well, or for which there is no standard treatment. People in clinical trials often receive close medical monitoring, adn their health care and medications are ususally paid for, at least in part, by the company or the research institution sponsoring the trial.</p>
        <p>Many people who enter trials also find it heartening to think that even if the treatment does not help them, doctors may learn something that will help others.</p>
        <p>The potential drawbacks of being in a trial come from the fact that it is an experiment, and researchers do not know whether the new treatment will be safe and effective. Patients may be testing drugs or procedures never tried before in humans; there is a risk of being harmed. And if there is no standard treatment for an illness being studied, patients entering a trial may be assigned randomly to a control group that is being given placebos, a prospect that many find discouraging.</p>
        <p>Well-meaning doctors and hopeful patients may gloss over the primary mission of a clinical trial, which is not to benefit particpants but to gather information. Sick people in trials want to think of themselves as patients being treated, rather than research subjects being experimented on, said George Annas, the chairman of the health law department at the Boston University School of Public Health. But the patients are, in fact, research subjects, he said.</p>
        <p>In properly designed trials, independent researchers monitor the data as they accumulate so that the experiment can be halted if one group starts doing signficantly better than the other. Of course, that means the other group is doing worse, a determination that may not be made until a certain number of participants suffer adverse effects, deteriorate or even die.</p>
        <p>People with severe illnesses are often willing to take considerable risks for the chance to be cured. Dr. Christiaan Barnard, the South African heart transplant pioneer, described his patients' circumstances in the early days of transplanation as ''lions or corcodiles'': a person being chased by a lion to the edge of a river would jump in and try to swim across even if the river was full of crocodiles, but would never jump in if there were no lion.</p>
        <p>Some do make it to the other side, however. About a year ago, Mary Anna Kralj-Pokerznik, a middle-school teacher in Edmonton, Alberta, heard about a study at the University of Edmonton in which patients with Type 1 diabetes would be given transplants of insulin-producing cells to try to cure the disease. Patients with Type 1 diabetes make little or no insulin of their own, and must take injections of the hormone several times a day to control their blood surgar.</p>
        <p>Doctors had been trying such transplants for about 20 years, usually failing. This time, the cells, taken from the pancreas of organ donors, would be injected into the liver, and a new set of antirejection drugs would be used. Risks included the possibility of damaging the liver and, from the antirejection drugs, increased odds of infection and even certain cancers.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kralj-Pokerznik, who is 30, had been idabetic for 20 years. She was jabbing herself in the fingers 20 times a day to test her blood sugar, taking insulin shots sixtimes a day and adhering to a rigid diet. Even so, she had tremendous swings in sugar levels which often brought her close to passing out, or left her feeling sick and lethargic.</p>
        <p>''The complications of diabetes - blindness, amputations, kidney failure, cardiovascular - I knew that with my fluctuations, it was not a matter of if, but of when,'' she said. ''With this new therapy, being on low-dose antirejection drugs, there are some risks. But they are maybes. The others were a given.''</p>
        <p>In May 1999, Ms. Kralj-Pokerznik under-went the cell transplant, which was performed by Dr James Shapiro, the leader of the university's transplant team. She has been off insulin for a year, with no signs of diabetes.</p>
        <p>''It was hard to believe at first,'' she said. ''It didn't seem real.'' She revels in small, newfound freedoms: being able to take a walk whenever she feels like it, no longer planning her days around a rigid schedule of meals and snacks, shots and blood tests. She knows that the cells could fail or be rejected, but, she said, ''I am hopeful.''</p>
        <p>The Edmonton team has successfully treated eight patients, and their results, which will be published next month in The New England Journal of Medicine, were posted on its Web site in June as an ''early release,'' which the journal reserves for studies of major import. Medical centers in this country will try the new procedure probably later this year.</p>
        <p>Not every experiment goes as well. For instance, at a cancer conference in May in New Orleans, Dr. Russell DeVore of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn., reported that in a clinical trial, four lung cancer patients unexpectedly began coughing up blood and died, possibly from an experimental drug, Rhumab.</p>
        <p>The public image of clinical triasl suffered greatly last year when Jesse Gelsinger, an 18-year-old from tucson, died during a trial of gene therapy at the University of Pennsylvania, from an infusion of gene-altered viruses meant to correct an enzyme defiency. The defiency had been under control with diet, so Mr. Gelsinger was not in the kind of desperate situation that might have justified the experiment's risks.</p>
        <p>An investigation revealed that he and his parents had not been fully informed of the dangers, and that Mr.Gelsinger had had some abnormal laboratory tests suggesting that he should have not been injected with the viruses. Gene therapy trials at the university were shut down.</p>
        <p>Dr. Overmoyer noted that highly publicized cases had made some patients wary of clinical trials. ''It is so disheartening on so many levels,'' she said. ''It breaks down the foundation of trust.''</p>
        <p>At the Ireland Center, she said, ''consent forms are very thorough, with every type of risk, almost including alien vasion; they are quite scary.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Myhal did not hesitate to enroll. ''I felt we were heading in the right direction,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As predicted, the injections of SU5416 gave her cramps, headaches and some swelling of the affected breast. Because the drug can affect blood vessels, she is also being monitored closely for changes in blood clotting or in bleeding, as well as for heart problems. But, she said, she is reassured by the concern ad compassion of the nurses who are assisting with the study.</p>
        <p>After several rounds of treatment, she noticed that the tumor seemed to be shrinking. ''I think it's going to be all right,'' she said. ''I don't think the Lord would have presented this had it not been meant to be.''</p>
        <p>She has become friendly with another woman in the study. They go to the clinic at different times, but often leave notes for each another. ''We're like two girls in a capsule, but we're floating,'' Ms. Myhal said. ''Hopefully, when we get out of this we'll have time to do something together.''</p>
        <p>Where to Search for Trials</p>
        <p>VARIOUS searchable Internet sites offer extensive information about clinical trials, including lists of studies and explanations of informed consent and the different phases of trials and how they work. In some cases, information can also be obtained by telephone.</p>
        <p>Actis.org gives information on clinical trials, specifically on AIDS; (800) 874-2572.</p>
        <p>cancertrials.nci.nih.gov provides information about clinical trials in cancer. The National Cancer Institute also offers a Cancer Information Service, which helps patients to locate trials. Telephone: 1-800-4-CANCER.</p>
        <p>www.CenterWatch.com, a division of the Medical Economics publishing company, lists newly approved drugs and clinical trials for many diseases. It also offers information on participating in clinical trials.</p>
        <p>ClinicalTrials.gov, introduced in February by the National Institutes of Health, provides information on more than 4,400 federal and private studies of a wide array of diseases at about 50,000 sites nationwide.</p>
        <p>www.nih.gov, the site of the National Institutes of Health, provides links to member institutes, many of which provide clinical trial information on their home pages. For example, www.nei.nih .gov, the site of the National Eye Institute, lists clinical studies on eye disorders; click on ''clinical studies database''; (301) 496-5248.</p>
        <p>www.nimh.nih.gov, the site of the National Institute of Mental Health, gives information on clinical trials for patients with mental disorders; (301) 443-4513.</p>
