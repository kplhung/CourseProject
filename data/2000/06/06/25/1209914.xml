        <p>Plato's Garage</p>
        <p>By Rob Campbell.</p>
        <p>264 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>St. Martin's Press. $23.95.</p>
        <p>THE nearly two dozen essays that make up ''Plato's Garage,'' Rob Campbell's tour through ''the magical realms'' of cars, zigzag through a lot of genres. There isn't one chapter, whether philosophy, semiotics, reportage, travelogue or about seven different variations on the memoir (coming of age, coming out, nervous breakdown, dysfunctional family, child of divorce, odd jobs, collisions with foreign cultures), that doesn't recall an entire book devoted to that subject.</p>
        <p>But the casual construction of ''Plato's Garage,'' and the faint echoes, in Campbell's unadorned prose, of writers as disparate as Mary Karr, Charles Kuralt and Paul Monette, throw into stark relief just how cleverly Campbell has made his first book's lack of focus work for him. The paradoxical pleasure of this book about cars is that there's little if any narrative drive. Campbell starts off by pondering Plato's cave: his book's title, he writes, is ''a vague way of saying that I wanted to philosophize about cars, to look at the effect they have on our lives beyond what we perceive.'' There is no problem laid out to be solved, no conclusion reached, though Campbell's belief in a mental construct he calls Plato's Garage -- a very real place to me, a peaceful zone where I could contemplate the symbiotic connection between human beings and automobiles'' -- is intriguing.</p>
        <p>The book is ostensibly a memoir, but the best chapters are profiles of other people, and in many of the chapters that are explicitly about Campbell and his family, the most dramatic events (Campbell's H.I.V. diagnosis, the breakup of his eight-year relationship) seem to happen in the margins of the pages. There are wonderful stray bits: an evocation of ''Doris Day parking'' (why is it that Doris Day never has to look for a parking space in her romantic comedies?), for example, or Campbell's writing about ''the ghost taxis of Kyoto'' and why, during his time in Japan, he ''made the Kyoto taxi my personal focus and spiritual transportation device.''</p>
        <p>The pleasures of such passages are compromised by the fact that Campbell doesn't have anything very meaningful to say about Japanese culture or its influence on him. Still, it's Campbell whom the reader comes to care about. The freshness of his straightforwardly simple style is more engaging than the mundane incidents he often chooses to describe.</p>
        <p>Campbell's suggestion that there are dense connections between cars, identity and gender comes closest to expressing what seems to be the heart of the book: that there is a ''supercharged poetry'' to be found in the ''perfect symbiosis between car and driver''; that for Campbell, too, there are ways in which, as his Cadillac-loving friend says of cars, ''they're almost like an extension of my own body.''</p>
        <p>THREE stunning documentary chapters, profiling a number of people living on ''the ragged edge,'' are the most vivid in the book. We meet a transsexual who transformed his body from male to female mainly because he ''got tired of working with cars and objects and mechanical paraphernalia''; an H.I.V.-positive Southern California man whose flamboyant Cadillac (''It's a real head turner, and it's so huge'') matches his own ''flesh impact, which is not to be confused with sex appeal, though he's got that too''; and two small-time celebrities in Los Angeles whose identities are so wrapped up in their cars that Campbell fantasizes that he is the love child of the ''wayward wannabe teenage superstars'' he imagines them to have been in 1965.</p>
        <p>Not all the profiles are so memorable, and ''Plato's Garage'' does not consistently reach the level of complexity hinted at in its best parts. The biggest surprise is that Campbell's wide-eyed enthusiasm for cars and the characters who fall in love with them is more than enough to hold the pieces together. ''Plato's Garage'' works on charm. It isn't a beautiful book, but it has the great personality you never want to hear about when you're set up on a blind date.</p>
