        <p>The Devils, the holders of the Stanley Cup, have a history of shrewd drafting and a knack for finding hungry players off the beaten path. Last season's roster included Scott Gomez, an Alaskan who became the National Hockey League's first Hispanic star, and Krzysztof Oliwa, a former coal miner from Poland who reached the big league as a fistfighting specialist.</p>
        <p>But in today's entry draft, in which they had seven of the first 76 choices, the Devils selected an international player with a history as colorful as that of any prospect in the world. He is Max Birbraer, who said he was a Russian Jew from Kazakhstan who lived and played in Israel after his family moved there in part to avoid anti-Semitism in the former Soviet Union.</p>

        <p>The Devils, the holders of the Stanley Cup, have a history of shrewd drafting and a knack for finding hungry players off the beaten path. Last season's roster included Scott Gomez, an Alaskan who became the National Hockey League's first Hispanic star, and Krzysztof Oliwa, a former coal miner from Poland who reached the big league as a fistfighting specialist.</p>
        <p>But in today's entry draft, in which they had seven of the first 76 choices, the Devils selected an international player with a history as colorful as that of any prospect in the world. He is Max Birbraer, who said he was a Russian Jew from Kazakhstan who lived and played in Israel after his family moved there in part to avoid anti-Semitism in the former Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>After moving to Canada to play junior hockey, Birbraer returned to Israel to renew his passport last year, only to be arrested and imprisoned for three weeks for avoiding the draft in Israel. After that, he served a few months in the army but was discharged for medical reasons that remain vague.</p>
        <p>A left wing who scored 50 goals in 47 games with Newmarket in Tier II junior hockey in Ontario last season, Birbraer is 19 years old and is expected to play in the minor leagues next season.</p>
        <p>He speaks four languages, including a little Hebrew. His jaws and chin have an angular little beard, his hair is frosted blond and his body is decorated with several tattoos, including one of barbed wire to commemorate his prison days and another with the Hebrew phrase for ''Brothers Forever,'' in honor of a friend who sponsored him in Canada.</p>
        <p>He said his parents, living south of Tel Aviv, would be happy to hear that ''I'm the first Israeli ever to be drafted'' in the N.H.L.</p>
        <p>As for his style, Birbraer said: ''I love hockey. I started enjoying it even more when I came to Canada. I love the Canadian style. I like to hit people, too. Score goals. Hit people. Fans love that.''</p>
        <p>Chosen 67th over all, Birbraer was the first of two New Jersey picks in the third round. In the first round, the Devils chose David Hale with the 22nd pick. He is a 6-foot-1-inch, 204-pound defenseman from Colorado who played last season as a junior with Sioux City of the United States Hockey League. The N.H.L.'s Central Scouting service said Hale was ''an intense, punishing player who can intimidate opponents.''</p>
        <p>In the second round, the Devils had four picks. They chose Teemu Laine, a 6-1, 194-pound right wing from Finland, with the 39th pick over all. With their second pick in the second round, 56th over all, the Devils chose Aleksandr Suglobov, a 6-foot, 176-pound forward from Russia. With their third pick in the round, 57th over all, the Devils chose Matt Demarchi, a 6-2, 180-pound defenseman from Minnesota who plays for the University of Minnesota. With their fourth pick in the round, the Devils chose another Minnesotan, Pual Martin, a 6-1, 170-pound defenseman who played last season for Elk River High School.</p>
        <p>After choosing Birbraer with their first pick in the third round, the Devils used their second pick in the round, the 76th over all, to select Michael Rupp, a defenseman from Cleveland who played last season with Erie of the Ontario junior league. Rupp was drafted two years ago in the first round by the Islanders, but he re-entered the draft this season because they did not sign him.</p>
        <p>Lou Lamoriello, general manager of the Devils, said he was ''very pleased, extremely pleased'' with all the selections. Regarding Birbraer, Lamoriello said: ''We were aware of everything about him. I personally like those type of individuals who have talent and a rough going, not have everything handed to them.''</p>
        <p>Birbraer said he was not religious and his parents did not even tell him he was Jewish until he was in his teens. It was better not to know, he said, because that way other children would not make an issue of it.</p>
        <p>Birbraer speaks English well, with a slight accent, and he enjoys conversing. He has been living north of Toronto and said he had friends in the New York metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>Of his time in a military prison, he said: ''I feel mentally strong now. It wasn't easy. It was pretty crazy, just like the army.''</p>
