        <p>THE show called ''The California Impressionists at Laguna'' is a stimulating blend of similarities and differences. The summer show, at the Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme, is designed for comparison with the Lyme Art Colony that flourished early in the 20th century, and also to demonstrate what was innately Californian about the Western brand of Impressionism.</p>
        <p>The museum's curator, Jack Becker, has arranged the 26 paintings borrowed from many Western collections into a series of rooms focusing on a particular theme. In each room he has hung a representative work from the Lyme colony for instant contrast. It's unfair to the Eastern works, since, in the proximity of their Western cousins, they seem drained of color and almost shy in attitude. The California paintings are, in a word, robust.</p>

        <p>THE show called ''The California Impressionists at Laguna'' is a stimulating blend of similarities and differences. The summer show, at the Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme, is designed for comparison with the Lyme Art Colony that flourished early in the 20th century, and also to demonstrate what was innately Californian about the Western brand of Impressionism.</p>
        <p>The museum's curator, Jack Becker, has arranged the 26 paintings borrowed from many Western collections into a series of rooms focusing on a particular theme. In each room he has hung a representative work from the Lyme colony for instant contrast. It's unfair to the Eastern works, since, in the proximity of their Western cousins, they seem drained of color and almost shy in attitude. The California paintings are, in a word, robust.</p>
        <p>Laguna Beach, between Los Angeles and San Diego, has a great variety of scenery that naturally attracts painters. The most stunning feature is a long meandering coastline, but there are also desert, bold hills and valleys as well as snow-capped mountains. Artists from Los Angeles began to assemble to the small town of Laguna Beach around 1903.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Lyme colony, Laguna Beach was a more ad hoc arrangement; there was no place where artists congregated on the order of the Griswold House (which became the Griswold museum). Instead of living in a boardinghouse, they preferred to set up tents on the beach. Nevertheless the artist population grew in a fashion similar to that of the Lyme colony, through one painter telling another of the rich possibilities for landscape that Laguna Beach afforded. Enlarged vintage photographs of the California artists at work -- their easels set up almost on the water, with umbrellas protecting them from the intense light as they painted -- help set the scene.</p>
        <p>One of the most appealing paintings in the exhibition centers on the local atmosphere and has has little to do with landscape. In ''Curiosity,'' by Joseph Kleitsch, two little girls (the torn sleeve on the dress of one indicates they are poor) are investigating the tools of a painter's trade, especially a palette. The work is painted with especially vigorous brushstrokes.</p>
        <p>A series of arches in the background indicated that the scene of Kleitsch's painting is the mission of San Juan Capistrano, a major landmark. The mission was in ruins, which gave the painters a chance to indulge in a mild sort of Romanticism, like the painters who went to Europe in search of picturesque remnants of the past.</p>
        <p>Alson Skinner Clark's view of a mostly-intact corner of the church has an intensely sun-bleached look making it seem especially ancient. The Connecticut counterpart is Everett L. Warner's ''Village Church,'' modest and white, though its steeple has a strong thrust.</p>
        <p>The coastline where the blue Pacific -- and in several paintings it is very blue -- is the Laguna colony's calling card, and one room is hung with paintings focused on the simple but rich efect of waves meeting the shore in various calibrations of strength. George Gardner Symons's large work carries the pretty title, ''Under a Blue Sky,'' but it is a vigorous essay in rough waves crashing against rugged rocks. It is a stock subject, popular from Maine to California, that gives an artist a chance to display a technique that rivals nature in its dash.</p>
        <p>On the other hand Anna Hills's ''July Afternoon, Laguna'' is small and jewel-like. A dense stand of trees partially hides the coastline and lends a bold block of dark tonality to the painting's otherwise nearly blinding brightness. The Connecticut work brought in for contrast with the coastline paintings is Childe Hassam's ''Late Afternoon Sunset.'' In this rather hazy painting, which is sharply different from the almost crystalline standard of the California works, the orange sun is setting on the Lieutenant River in Old Lyme.</p>
        <p>A room of the museum focusing on dry land includes William Griffith's ''In Laguna Canyon'' displayed on an easel. This large work is characterized by an unexpected and pervasive verdancy.</p>
        <p>The painter who commands this facet of the exhibition is William Wendt whom Mr. Becker describes as very religious. His ''Road that Leads Nowhere'' does have an air of spiritual mystery as well as a full moon. ''Twilight (Moulton Ranch Near Laguna),'' also featuring the moon, is almost Symbolist; Munch and van Gogh might come to mind. But Wendt also shifted styles. He painted the complex, ''Twisted and Gnarled,'' a study of trees in autumn, and ''Old Coast Highway Bridge'' built of blocky shapes. Along with these is Willard Metcalf's ''Early October,'' a rugged Connecticut scene marked by stone outcroppings.</p>
        <p>The town of Laguna Beach itself is the last category. Artists such as Kleitsch with his ''Old Laguna'' might show the town from a distance as a grouping of small peaked-roof buildings and as very subordinate to the surrounding nature.</p>
        <p>Mr. Becker notes that calling it Old Laguna in the mid-1920's, when the work was painted, means that the remote and unspoiled town the artists knew is fading. But Kleitsch also painted the downtown area with a lively population, in a way reminiscent of John Sloan's approach.</p>
        <p>Chester Hinkle's ''Overlooking Laguna'' is structured as a mass of short horizontal and vertical marks, a geometry rather like that in Mondrian's early abstractions. And the painting is almost all white, fixing the viewer's opinion that historic Laguna was a bedazzling place.</p>
        <p>Likewise, Charles Ebert's ''House on Lyme Street'' rouses fond feelings for bygone days around Connecticut.</p>
        <p>''The California Impressionists at Laguna'' is at the Florence Griswold Museum, Old Lyme, through Sept. 24.</p>
