        <p>TO have lived with H.I.V. for a decade or more is to have died with it many times over.</p>
        <p>First came the assumption of imminent death, common to just about everyone who got the diagnosis before the mid-1990's. Wills were hastily written. Credit card debts ran up, and long-term plans were forgotten.</p>
        <p>Then came the burying of friends, sometimes dozens, sometimes at a funeral a month. Those who were infected sat in support groups, on buses, at dinners, staring at those who were sicker, frantically trying to recall when the other person took that crucial turn for the worse, wondering how far away it was for them.</p>
        <p>There were the near deaths, as medical developments raced to keep up with the progression of their illness. Some were ready to die, sick and exhausted from treatments, strict pill regimens and side effects as well as myriad hospital visits.</p>
        <p>But those same people who were infected in the 80's and are alive today have slowly watched death skulk from their doorsteps. They grieve at far fewer funerals. They have walked away from wheelchairs and beds to return to work, attend school, have babies, counsel others, go to church, take vacations and send to college the children they never expected to see grow up.</p>
        <p>Lee Chew, who received his diagnosis of H.I.V. in 1987, noticed the transition in 1997, a year after he became paralyzed and was close to death with full-blown AIDS. It dawned on him that he had not been in the hospital for more than a year.  ''You started to think the wolf was no longer at the door,'' he said recently. ''He may be down the street now, or maybe he is in the next town. But he isn't coming for me.''</p>
        <p>People like Mr. Chew are living on the other end of an incredible medical journey that has surprised even the most experienced scientists and health workers. Antiviral drugs -- mainly the protease inhibitors introduced in the mid-90's -- have proved to be more effective than doctors and patients had dared to hope. And while they are expensive, they are also widely available, thanks to clinics and government subsidies.</p>
        <p>''We have shifted from a clinic that was largely devoted to preparing patients to die to one that prepares people to live,'' said Dr. John G. Bartlett, the director of AIDS services at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore. ''It is the biggest change in a disease I have witnessed in 30 years of doing infectious diseases.''</p>
        <p>Of course, plenty of people are still getting the virus. Doctors are alarmed by the increase in unsafe sex among young gay men who may be lulled into thinking the virus is no longer deadly. Among many groups, however, the principal mode of transmission has shifted from sex to contaminated drug needles.</p>
        <p>As the face of AIDS has changed, the need for services for the infected is greater than it was 10 years ago. Dennis Snyder, who volunteers at an AIDS service center in rural Pennsylvania, has watched the center's demographics shift from young, male and white to mostly black and Hispanic since he started volunteering in 1994. Many clients are women, some recently released from prison. (Nationwide, the percentage of women among people with AIDS has more than tripled since the epidemic's beginnings, to 23 percent in 1998 from 7 percent in 1985.) Almost all are poor.</p>
        <p>''When AIDS first came around, it was guys who needed a support group, information about vitamins, things like that,'' Mr. Snyder said. ''Now we are dealing with issues of poverty.''</p>
        <p>And despite the medical advances, many people still die of complications from AIDS -- mainly those who seek treatment too late, and those who develop resistance to the newest drugs. The virus still devastates many parts of the world, most notably sub-Saharan Africa, where drugs have been unavailable or have been prohibitively expensive, and prevention efforts are stymied. Further, many of the wonder drugs that made researchers hopeful just a few years ago have turned out, for some people, to have perilous and even lethal side effects.</p>
        <p>But many people who have had H.I.V. for many years have found their lives twisting unexpectedly toward something other than sure and fast demise. The ride has been more complicated than they ever imagined.</p>
        <p>From the Wheelchair to the Gym</p>
        <p>Lee Chew, 51, started to have vague notions about the so-called gay cancer in 1982, when he was starting his acting career in traveling shows. ''I didn't smoke, I didn't do drugs, I had never had a sexually transmitted disease,'' was his reasoning at the time. ''I tried to look for ways that I was out of the loop'' of contracting AIDS. Nonetheless, he decided it was time to settle down.</p>
        <p>In 1984, touring in the show ''Woman of the Year'' with Barbara Eden, he met Howard Crabtree, a costume designer and a co-author of several Off Broadway musicals, and they fell in love. They moved in together two months later.</p>
        <p>In 1985, the two decided to get H.I.V. tests. Mr. Chew was negative. Mr. Crabtree was not. The doctor who informed them of their results did not talk to them about safe sex, and he certainly did not talk about AZT because there was no such thing. ''A lot of people didn't even want the news because there was nothing that could be done,'' Mr. Chew said.</p>
        <p>He decided to stick it out with his partner. ''I guess I had a Romeo-and-Juliet sort of fantasy,'' he said. ''We were cursed and we would die together.'' But in 1987, the relationship soured, and that August, Mr. Chew went for another test. This time, the results were positive.</p>
        <p>The day he received the diagnosis, he went to a support group, ''just to prove to myself that I hadn't died.'' With no drugs in sight, the formerly apolitical Mr. Chew found himself involved in the protest group Act Up, and was arrested two months after his diagnosis at a protest in Washington. ''I don't think I would have bothered if I had not been H.I.V.-positive,'' he said. ''But I had nothing left to lose.''</p>
        <p>For several years, his health remained good, and his career continued to flourish. Off Broadway and traveling productions beckoned. In 1988, he went on AZT. But all around him, the grim certainty of his future was evident. People came to support groups 10 pounds thinner than the week before. Then they did not come back at all. Among those to die were his own doctor, whose death and H.I.V. status Mr. Chew learned from an obituary.</p>
        <p>In 1994, Mr. Chew learned that his T-cell count had dipped below 200, heralding the arrival of AIDS. In 1996, he started to get pneumonia and other constant infections. He was in the hospital four times that year. In 1996, he had to leave a production of ''The Front Page'' in Cleveland, marking the end of his career. Then he learned something else: Mr. Crabtree was dead.</p>
        <p>At the same time, a series of new drugs he was taking caused nerve damage to most of his body, and he had to get a wheelchair. ''I felt it was unstoppable,'' he said. ''I had no illusions. I started to wrap things up. I thought it was O.K., because I had so many friends in heaven or hell. You get a little attached to dead people.''</p>
        <p>He went to Madison, Wis., to be with his sister, and half expected never to leave the hospital there. But somehow he fought off yet another bout of pneumonia and came home to New York.</p>
        <p>That May, he started a new drug regime, which slowly turned his life around. With the introduction of Crixivan, he watched his body repair itself. Out of the wheelchair and to a cane. From a cane to a bicycle. And then he was back in the gym. He has not had an AIDS-related infection since late 1996. Two years ago, he began graduate school at New York University, studying social work.</p>
        <p>His AIDS activism has fallen away, and he said he goes to far fewer support groups. ''I don't want to obscure the fact that there are people who took Crixivan and threw it up,'' he said. ''That there are people who are dying of AIDS while we sit here.''</p>
        <p>But AIDS is taking up a smaller and smaller part of his identity. ''I have given myself permission to pull away,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chew recently got a tattoo -- a red cross in a circle, signifying his illness -- on his back. ''For 13 years, so much of my life has been focused on H.I.V.,'' he said. ''But this is on my back, because I wanted it to be behind me.''</p>
        <p>Between Sadness and Relief</p>
        <p>If Thomas K. Duane were in any other profession, his H.I.V. might never have been known to anyone, including his own family. Although it was diagnosed in 1988, and he thinks he was infected long before that, he has never had a single related infection. His medicine chest is not bursting -- he takes pills only to prevent herpes. A big health problem, he concedes, is keeping weight off.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Duane, who is a 45-year-old New York state senator, first revealed to the world that he was infected when he was seeking a spot on the New York City Council in 1991. Guided by a politician in Minneapolis who had revealed his H.I.V.-positive status to constituents in a letter, Mr. Duane's campaign team mailed letters to 40,000 households, saying that as a candidate for public office, ''I believe in being candid.''</p>
        <p>His campaign manager was horrified, as were several friends, but he won that race.  In an odd way, AIDS had been part of Mr. Duane's political life long before he got the diagnosis. He was politically active, both as a rising star in local Democratic circles and among his many friends who had become sick. He, too, joined Act Up.</p>
        <p>But he never got sick himself, which has puzzled him and made him take stock of his life -- not because it is about to end, but because it apparently is not.</p>
        <p>''I am pulling out of a period of profound sadness,'' Mr. Duane said, recalling the deaths of dozens of friends, three of his closest in recent years. His father died in 1995, two months after a younger brother died suddenly of a brain tumor. ''I always thought I would get sick,'' he said, ''and get to spend time with them because I would no longer be able to work.''</p>
        <p>Asked how his life has changed most since his H.I.V. was diagnosed, Mr. Duane squeezed his eyes shut and kept them that way for a minute. ''I think there is still an umbrella of anger about H.I.V. because it has taken so many people away from me,'' he said finally. ''I have so many sad memories. But I am happy I have lived long enough to develop a spiritual life, and I am not sure I would have without H.I.V. I would not have said that two years ago.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes, when I am in the Senate chamber, which is this very beautiful place, I think, 'You people have no idea what I have gone through and what my life is like,' and I am so much more fortunate than other people. But I do think H.I.V. makes me feel a little bit separate because the sadness has been so profound and the fear so tremendous.''</p>
        <p>Still Sick, but 'Still Here'</p>
        <p>The sun was bright and strong, as it often is in Fort Worth, when Ruth Jimenez drove home from the post office that morning in September 1986. Stopped by a train at a railroad crossing, she decided to open the registered letter she had just picked up.  Never, ever would she have guessed that it was informing her that she was infected with H.I.V.</p>
        <p>''I just lost it,'' remembered Ms. Jimenez, who is 46. ''I could not even to this day tell you how I got home.''</p>
        <p>She had had an operation to remove part of her kidney the year before, and in gratitude for the blood she had received, decided to give some back. It was through the blood center that she learned the awful news. A divorced mother of four, she immediately set up a guardianship for her youngest. ''I thought I would be dead inside a couple of months.''</p>
        <p>As a licensed vocational nurse, she had seen a smattering of young white men with weeks to live come into the hospital where she worked. She quickly devised a plan, based on her scant understanding of the disease. ''I quit smoking because I knew pneumonia,'' she said. ''I didn't have any more relationships. I was bound and determined I was going to survive to see my youngest graduate from high school. I always had the sense of waiting for the other shoe to drop.''</p>
        <p>In 1989, she moved her family to a small town in west Texas, trying to remove the stress of the big city from her life. She remained healthy and working, and told almost no one about her illness. But in 1991, it became unavoidable. Constant battles with the flu weakened her, and she often had to crawl to the bathroom. The nearest AIDS clinic was in Abilene, more than an hour away. She had no help outside her home, and no encouragement to look for any.</p>
        <p>''We were living in a little tiny town,'' Ms. Jimenez said. At the Abilene clinic one day, she was asked if her children had shared the news about their mom. When she asked why, workers said, ''Because we have been getting calls from people in your town saying they know someone there has AIDS, and they are going to bomb the place unless we tell them who it is.''</p>
        <p>Desperate for support and deeply religious, she decided to turn to her pastor after services that Sunday. But first she sat through the homily. ''During the service, he said that everyone who had AIDS deserved to have it, and he hoped they died soon,'' she said. ''I thought, 'This is the person I was going to put my child's welfare in.' You expect stupidity from people, but not your clergyman.''</p>
        <p>Her health worsened. Doctors advised her to return to Fort Worth to take advantage of more resources, and to make the most of her time with her children. By then, she was sick so often she was fired from her job. ''I was pretty well whipped,'' she said. ''I had no hope. I didn't want to fight anymore.''</p>
        <p>In Fort Worth, the AIDS clinic where she sought treatment required that she attend a support group for women. ''I thought it was a waste of time,'' she said. There she met women who were in the same boat. One in particular, Katherine, pushed her to speak to school groups and others about her experience, both to help others and to keep her going. ''She said, 'You need to get your back up and fight for your baby.' Her attitude was so different from mine.''</p>
        <p>Her drug treatments have not been as successful. ''I have now been on every combination of drugs that they have,'' Ms. Jimenez said. Last November, her doctor explained that she was resistant to almost  every therapy. She is not taking any medicines now. And though her T-cell count and viral load are in good shape, most experts say that these levels cannot be sustained without drugs.</p>
        <p>''I think it is because I am trying to keep my stress levels down,'' she said. ''My attitude has changed so much since 1994. It has been worth it. I am here. My youngest is graduating, and I am still here.''</p>
