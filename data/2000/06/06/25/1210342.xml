        <p>The first day of long-awaited national elections was reported largely peaceful today, apparently free of the brazen intimidation and violence that marked the campaign and threatened to mar a vote seen as the biggest challenge to the grip of President Robert Mugabe in the 20 years since white minority rule ended.</p>
        <p>A smattering of voter registration problems and a number of delays in distributing accreditation to local election monitors were reported, but election observers said the troubles were far less serious than they could have been, and that the process so far was most notable for being peaceful.</p>
        <p>''It's very quiet, surprisingly calm,'' said Irene-Maria Eich, a spokeswoman for the election observers from the European Union, which has the largest contingent of foreign monitors. ''It's really going well. It's good news.''</p>
        <p>At a news conference tonight, Mariyo Mariyawanda Nzuwah, the chairman of the Zimbabwe Elections Directorate, said that the turnout has been ''tremendous,'' with long lines reported in both urban and rural areas, and that the election has been marked by ''peacefulness.''</p>
        <p>The country's more than five million voters are electing a new Parliament, and the party that has controlled the government since blacks won majority rule in 1980 is facing its first real challenge.</p>
        <p>In less than a year, a rising opposition party led by a coalition of black academics and labor activists has seized on deepening popular discontent over the nation's crumbling economy and continuing corruption to challenge the governing party.</p>
        <p>Indeed the only real question in this weekend's voting is how many seats the new party, the Movement for Democratic Change, will take from Mr. Mugabe, who has led the country since 1980. His party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, called ZANU-PF, controls all but three seats in the 150-member Parliament.</p>
        <p>Here in this urban center about 35 miles south of the capital, Harare, and in the rural communities that surround it, interviews with voters this morning suggested that the results are likely to follow the pattern that has emerged as the opposition has gained support.</p>
        <p>Older and rural voters appear to be sticking with the party of the 76-year-old president and former guerrilla leader while younger and urban voters seem more likely to latch on to the new party as their best hope for a change in the country's miserable economic fortunes.</p>
        <p>At the office of the rural development agency in the village of Seke, several miles from here, voters stood in line today, clutching their identity documents, waiting to cast their ballots by candlelight in the dark, drafty interior of an unlighted building. Everyone interviewed said the decision to come out to vote, despite the violence of the last several months, was easy -- and the decision about who to support seemed to have been even easier.</p>
        <p>''I voted for Mugabe,'' said Esther Mugiyo, 59. Though the president is not up for re-election this year, he is considered the embodiment of his party. ''He's doing everything for us that we need in the rural areas,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Like others interviewed here, she knew almost nothing about the new opposition party. Most of what she learns about politics, she said, comes from local leaders of the governing party, and what little she had heard about the new party only left her puzzled.</p>
        <p>''What I didn't understand,'' she said, ''is, what is this party for? We already won independence. We know ZANU-PF is our party.''</p>
        <p>Here, in the region's biggest town, however, voters appeared to be taking a different view of the election. Hundreds of people, a number of whites among them, waited as long as an hour to cast their ballot and -- to read between the lines of their comments -- to cast a vote for a change in the leadership of the nation.</p>
        <p>''We have to improve the economic situation,'' said James Sobola, a 25-year-old gardener, after voting in the auditorium of the Step Ahead Academy, a vocational school near the center of town.</p>
        <p>Like everyone else interviewed here, Mr. Sobola did not want to say for whom he had voted. Much of the political violence of the last several months has been directed at supporters of the opposition party, and Mr. Sobola said the prospect of more such attacks gave him pause as he contemplated casting his vote.</p>
        <p>''I worry so much,'' he said. ''It's not good, the violence. But I'm not afraid. We are in a free country.''</p>
        <p>Encouraged as they are by the calm of the first day, election observers have said that they are concerned about how widespread fears like Mr. Sobola's are and how many people might have passed up voting out of fear that the months-long campaign of intimidation against opposition supporters might spill over into this weekend.</p>
        <p>The European Union's observer mission is expected to deliver a preliminary report after the polls close on Sunday, and it will look carefully at turnout as a crucial measure of whether the pre-election intimidation compromised the fairness of the vote. Another question will be how quickly the Zimbabwean election authorities resolve the problems that surfaced today in accrediting the local observers, who number about 16,000.</p>
        <p>Another question will be how quickly the difficulties distributing accreditation to 16,000 local monitors are resolved. After saying it would only accredit a fraction of that number, the government decided late this week to accredit all of them. But election authorities said they did not have enough accreditation cards for all 16,000, and by this afternoon only about 30 percent had been issued the proper identification and sent to polling places.</p>
        <p>The Zimbabwean government's refusal to accredit British and American observers has been yet another issue, and while the government has refused to budge on British observers, it did ease its stance on Americans, saying Friday that it would allow 27 diplomats at the American Embassy to serve as observers.</p>
