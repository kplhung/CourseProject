        <p>The Pittsburgh Pirates finally ran out of breathing room last night against the Mets.</p>
        <p>Pittsburgh could not maintain its leads, which ranged from 4-3 to 8-4, and the Mets generated one last rally, with three runs in the eighth inning, for a 10-8 victory at Shea Stadium. The victory, coming as Todd Zeile drove home the tie-breaking runs with a double, extended the Mets' winning streak to three games.</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine credited the character of the Mets for their ability to remain in contention in the game -- that and a fine effort by the onetime closer John Franco.</p>
        <p>Franco came on in the eighth after the Mets had whittled the Pirates' lead to 8-7 with a three-run seventh. He mowed down three batters.</p>
        <p>Now the Mets were in position to strike back.</p>
        <p>''That was huge,'' Valentine said of Franco's eighth inning. ''He not only gave us an inning, but did it in excellent fashion. That put us in the driver's seat even though we were behind.''</p>
        <p>Franco went back out for the ninth, retired one batter and then gave way to the current closer, Armando Benitez. He got the final two outs, marking the first time all game that the Pirates had failed to score in two straight innings.</p>
        <p>The 39-year-old Franco said that coming in during the late innings as a set-up man, instead of as the closer, did not matter to him.</p>
        <p>''When I decided to come back, it was whatever it takes to help us win,'' said Franco (3-3), who got the victory.</p>
        <p>Robin Ventura, who hit two home runs to help keep the Mets (40-31) close all night, noted the ability to rally. ''It's one of the things about the game -- it's not a time clock,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Those early deficits guaranteed nothing, but they did look ominous for the Mets. A pitcher who had a career batting average lower than his temperature and who had blown his chances as a starter helped put the Mets in a hole early.</p>
        <p>The Pirates (31-42) are one of the anemic power teams, ranking next to last in the National League in home runs. But they swatted three in taking leads against Rick Reed and the first two relievers who followed him.</p>
        <p>This is how tough it was for Reed: of the first 14 batters he faced, nine got hits. Two went for home runs. As soon as he got out of the third inning, Valentine lifted him.</p>
        <p>''It was just one of those nights,'' Valentine said. ''He threw 75 pitches in the three innings.''</p>
        <p>By then, the Mets trailed, 4-1.</p>
        <p>Reed generally does good things for the Mets. They win when he starts, even if he is not the winner. The Mets are 10-4 when Reed starts, including 5-1 in his most recent appearances.</p>
        <p>But Reed had immediate trouble. No Mets outfielder moved as John Vander Wal crushed a home run estimated at 438 feet for a 2-0 edge.</p>
        <p>In the second, Jose Silva, who has a career average of .069 (4 for 58), singled in a run for a 3-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Silva was also making only his second start of the season. A career 18-36 as a starter now, he had been sent to the bullpen before getting another chance.</p>
        <p>The Mets began chipping away, only to have to dig some more: Ventura lengthened his hitting streak to 11 games in the Mets' second with a homer to right. That was offset by Kevin Young's smash, estimated at 430 feet, in the third.</p>
        <p>And so it went. Someone scored in every inning except the fourth and, of course, the ninth. But Mike Piazza extended his hitting streak to 13 games with a two-run double in the seventh, among other timely hits.</p>
        <p>It marked the 19th time this season the Mets had come from behind to post a victory.</p>
        <p>They'll need this resiliency for next weekend's four-game series with the Braves, whom they trail by three and a half games.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Mets would not comment, but one of their scouts was in Seattle Friday night at the Mariners-Orioles game. Presumably, he was looking at Baltimore's right-handed pitcher SCOTT ERICKSON and shortstop MIKE BORDICK. . . . MELVIN MORA went about as deep as a shortstop can go for a pop fly in the third. He chased LUIS SOJO's looper into left-center while two outfielders also converged on it. Mora snared the ball halfway between home and the 358-foot sign in left. . . . BOBBY J. JONES's solid stint Friday came just in time. It was Jones's first start since going to Class AAA Norfolk. ''It's totally different in the minor leagues, and you forget how really special it is to be a major league ballplayer,'' he said. ''I had a 4 a.m. wake-up call to catch a 5 a.m. flight to Pawtucket from Norfolk.''</p>
