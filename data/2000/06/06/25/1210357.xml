        <p>Will they return, or is the worst over? Will the buzzing black masses swarm around homes, settling on screens and siding?

        <p>If only the people of Naples knew. Last week, millions of flies hatched and descended on about half a dozen houses in town, three weeks after a local farmer spread 200 tons of chicken manure on a 20-acre field nearby. Some residents scattered to the homes of friends and relatives. The town's health officer, noting that dead flies were several inches deep around the houses, declared a public health risk. Neighbors joined to pester county and state health and environmental officials for help.</p>
        <p>By the end of last week, after chemical spraying and the use of lots of fly strips, traps and plain old fly swatters, the flies were down to the kind of nuisance found in a stable. But some residents of Naples, a town in the Finger Lakes region about 40 miles south of Rochester, were still clearing piles of dead flies from closets, front porches and tool sheds.</p>
        <p>''It was like a black cloud,'' said Ervin Paulsen, who lives across County Road 36 from the field where the manure was spread. He doused his house with insecticide. ''It was just like an Alfred Hitchcock movie.''</p>
        <p>Brenda Fleischman, who lives next to the field, said, ''I'd get home from work, and I'd have to get the hose and spray down the door to get in the house.'' First the odor of the manure and then the flies kept her, her husband and their two daughters in the house for weeks. They stopped drinking their well water after all four developed diarrhea. On Thursday, preliminary water testing confirmed the presence of potentially dangerous E. coli bacteria.</p>
        <p>Though their water had never been tested before and a local water official said it was not uncommon to find some E. coli in well water, the Fleischmans blame the manure.</p>
        <p>If only the beleaguered residents knew that the infestation was over, they could venture outdoors again to enjoy their spectacular views of the Bristol Hills. Naples, a town of 2,830, is typically known for its rural charm, vineyards and annual Grape Festival. But right now, some people are still hunkering down, scrubbing walls and sweeping floors.</p>
        <p>Phillip Kaufman, a veterinary entomologist at Cornell University who spoke with the farmer, Mark Adams, about the flies, said this type of ''giant fly explosion'' was reported only a few times a summer across the country. ''They're very likely through the worst part,'' Dr. Kaufman said. ''Once these adult flies are gone, the problem should be gone.''</p>
        <p>But the town supervisor, Donald Leysath, sounded worried as he talked about the region's recent run of wet, cool weather. ''If we continue to get rain, I'm going to have a fly problem,'' Mr. Leysath said as he surveyed the field in question.</p>
        <p>People a few miles down County Road 36 say they had a fly problem last summer after the farmer spread chicken manure on an 80-acre field there. The flies bothered them much of the summer, and again this spring after more manure was spread.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adams is a member of the Naples Town Board and president of Adams Hen House, the family farm, where he tends 105,000 laying hens. Those hens produce 2.5 million dozen eggs a year and 12 tons of manure a day. The eggs go to market. The manure has to go somewhere else.</p>
        <p>For years, he spread the manure on his own fields as fertilizer for crops like corn. But in the last few years, Mr. Adams -- who ironically is a member of the town's Board of Health, as well as president of the New York Poultry Association -- began leasing extra fields so he could spread the manure more thinly to better protect the soil and the water.</p>
        <p>Then the troubles began. Angry neighbors say Mr. Adams caused last week's fly infestation by dumping manure filled with larvae, which hatched into flies, and by not plowing the manure under quickly and thoroughly enough.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adams denies that the manure contained larvae when he spread it on the field. Dr. Kaufman said some flies had probably been attracted by the manure and had laid eggs before the plowing.</p>
        <p>But spreading manure is a common farm practice, and it rarely results in masses of flies. So why this invasion? ''There's a large number of variables and many unanswered questions,'' Dr. Kaufman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adams said he follows agricultural guidelines for applying manure and, when weather permits, for plowing the manure under within a few days. But he concedes that rain kept him from sealing off the manure until more than two weeks after he had spread it and plowed it under.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the Town Board prohibited Mr. Adams from spreading more manure this year on the 20-acre field. Because the area is in the Canandaigua Lake watershed, state environmental officials visited the fields today, Mr. Adams said, and concluded that his manure-spreading practices were sound.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adams is investigating an alternative for the manure: composting and selling it as dried fertilizer. ''It's becoming apparent to me that to be community-friendly, we have to come up with a different way of handling manure,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The change would come none too soon for Denise Wheaton and Charles Francis, who live across the street from the field. After spraying, their front porch was littered with thousands of dead flies. ''I've been around farms all my life,'' Mr. Francis said. ''I've never seen anything like this.''</p>
