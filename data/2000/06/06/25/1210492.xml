        <p>The Yankees kept trying to determine if they could persuade Juan Gonzalez to sign a contract extension so they could complete a trade with the Detroit Tigers, but a baseball official said the Yankees were growing skeptical tonight that they could do so.</p>
        <p>While the Yankees negotiated with Gonzalez's agents today, they remained unsuccessful in getting him to budge from his refusal to sign a contract extension. Because of Gonzalez's reluctance toward various proposals, the Yankees resumed their discussions with the Chicago Cubs about acquiring Sammy Sosa and made some progress.</p>
        <p>The talks with the Cubs served two purposes for the Yankees, giving them a second option if the Gonzalez deal fizzled and enabling them to maintain some leverage with Gonzalez. Still, that may not matter much longer because the Yankees are virtually certain they do not want to trade three young players simply to have the 30-year-old Gonzalez for the rest of this season. Gonzalez's agent had said he would play for the Yankees for the rest of the 2000 season.</p>
        <p>As the Gonzalez discussions unfolded, the Yankees had more substantive discussions about Sosa. The Yankees were turned off when the Cubs asked for at least five elite prospects, including Nick Johnson, Alfonso Soriano, Drew Henson and Jackson Melian, when the teams last spoke. But the Cubs have decreased those demands, as baseball officials said these talks were progressing.</p>
        <p>Gonzalez has been Plan A since the agreement was struck Thursday, and Sosa has been a clear Plan B -- particularly with Cubs officials apparently realizing they have a very limited market for Sosa.</p>
        <p>The Yankees had agreed in principle to trade outfielder Ricky Ledee, Henson, a third baseman who is their best prospect, and Randy Keisler, a Class AA pitcher, for Gonzalez, and they have a 72-hour window to come to terms with him. The window closes at noon Sunday, but the Yankees think they can get an extension. Still, that will be moot if it is clear that Gonzalez will not change his mind and the Yankees will not rent him for three months.</p>
        <p>As of this afternoon, the Yankees had not tried to use Bernie Williams, Gonzalez's childhood friend, as a recruiter. Williams said on Friday that he would be willing to talk with Gonzalez about the advantages of playing for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''It's exciting to think about talking to him and about him coming here,'' Williams said. ''It's almost unfair if we get him. I remember he carried Texas for about a month and a half a few years ago.''</p>
        <p>When a Detroit reporter told Gonzalez that Williams would be interested in speaking with him if the Yankees asked him to, Gonzalez said he would talk to Williams. Still, it appeared that Williams would have to be extremely persuasive for Gonzalez to agree to sign an extension, especially because Williams said he agreed with Gonzalez's desire to test the open market.</p>
        <p>''He should come here for the next three months and go medieval on people,'' Williams said. ''You know he's due.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees would probably be unwilling to trade three young players with no guarantee of having Gonzalez beyond this season. They could offer lesser prospects, but Detroit wants Henson, who is also a quarterback at the University of Michigan and would be a fan favorite.</p>
        <p>Gonzalez turned down an eight-year contract for around $140 million from the Tigers after they obtained him from the Texas Rangers; Jim Bronner, one of Gonzalez's agents, asked for $148 million. The Yankees would probably have to offer close to $140 million. Fernando Cuza, another of Gonzalez's agents, said his client would prefer to play the rest of the season with the Yankees before considering an extension.</p>
        <p>''He's got an open mind about going to the Yankees,'' Cuza said. ''He's got an open mind about talking to the Yankees.''</p>
        <p>Williams added: ''If he comes here and likes it, maybe they'll be able to sign him after that. He wouldn't be the only guy getting some attention, and he'd be hitting in a great lineup. It would be unbelievable.''</p>
