        <p>THE music was ''Pomp and Circumstance,'' but the graduates were not about to hear speeches about going forth to make their way in the world. Not yet, anyway.</p>
        <p>This ceremony marked the moving up of 43 3-  and 4-year-olds from first to second year of preschool and from second year of preschool to kindergarten at Immaculate Conception School here.</p>
        <p>The setting was the textbook definition of cute. The auditorium was festooned with blue and white balloons. Long tables were laden with juice and cookies, and folding chairs were set up for proud parents and friends. The clicks and whirrs of photographic equipment could be heard as mothers and fathers videotaped and snapped still shots.</p>
        <p>Behind the children, on the stage, was a huge cutout of a colorful butterfly; around it were drawings of caterpillars emerging from their cocoons. The theme was obvious: metamorphosis, growth and all those things that people stress at any turning point.</p>
        <p>Also obvious was the involvement of the principal, Louise Frangella. She believes that each milestone, each shift from one little era in a young life to another, should be marked as something special. ''We want to enhance what we have,'' she said. ''It's important to have reminders of significant moments. If you just ignore graduations -- or holidays, for that matter -- then everything is the same. It's important to make the children aware of the special things in life.''</p>
        <p>Awareness -- and observation of the world around them -- is paramount at the preschool, she added, explaining that it combines principles of Catholic religious education with those of the Montessori methods. In the brick Victorian building that houses the preschoolers, there are separate rooms for various activities. Painted white, with a minimum of decoration, these areas are meant to encourage quiet learning and appreciation of various stimuli. There is a ''practical life'' room, with neatly aligned teapots, measuring spoons, and so forth; a ''circle room,'' where morning prayers and the Pledge of Allegiance are recited; a computer room; and a room with maps, globes and geometric figures.</p>
        <p>The teachers, Maralyn Brois and Theresa Waters, do not just impart academic knowledge. In her speech to the audience, Ms. Frangella enumerated some of the philosophies: ''Make time for everything. Time to work alone and with a group, play, have a snack, rest and always acknowledge the beginning and ending of each day. There is really no need to shout -- speak gently to everyone; truth and sincerity are always heard. And cubbies have a purpose -- everything has a place, and there is a place for everything.''</p>
        <p>The children seemed to have absorbed these lessons, as they sat quietly in their pastel ruffled dresses and jackets and ties.</p>
        <p>On stage they sang standard songs like ''I'm a Little Teapot,'' ''If You're Happy and You Know It'' and ''Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.'' They also recited their usual morning prayer -- ''Thank you, God, for the new day and for the time to work and play'' -- and sang ''The Goodbye Song,'' which brought a few sentimental tears to the eyes of relatives in the audience.</p>
        <p>Sniffles could also be heard as the Rev. Raymond J. Byrne spoke of their fleeting innocence: ''Soon they begin to put on masks, to hide behind them. But now they're still so open, they teach us a lesson: that we need to be as honest and open as these little children.''</p>
        <p>After the hourlong ceremony, even the most well-behaved got a bit rambunctious as they ran around the room, happily calling out to one another, munching cookies and greeting their mothers and fathers.</p>
        <p>Sage Lofaro, 4, rushed up to her father, John, an accountant, and her mother, Laura, who describes herself as a stay-at-home mom. ''It's very bittersweet,'' Mrs. Lofaro said. ''In one way I'm so glad to see how much she's learned; on the other hand, it means she's growing up and that is sad.''</p>
        <p>The entire experience, she added, was ''very 'deja vuish.''</p>
        <p>''I came to this school, and I remember all I learned here. They are going to learn how to tell right from wrong, not just learn but to feel it. They are going to internalize good values.''</p>
        <p>Eileen O'Shea, a partner in an accounting firm, her husband, Daniel, chief executive of a publishing company, and their baby sitter, Marie Martin, were there for 5-year-old Danny O'Shea. Because she and her husband are so busy, Mrs. O'Shea said she is reassured to know that the school is imparting more than math and reading lessons. ''I think it brings together the best of everything -- the personal and social and religious side of things that children need to know. We are so happy today.''</p>
        <p>For at least one couple, the occasion was not one of unadulterated joy. Hugh Williamson-Noble, who is in the hotel business, and his wife, Esmerelda, who stays home with their son, hugged 5-year-old Robert.</p>
        <p>As he showed off his brightly colored diploma, they explained that five years ago, his twin, Alexander, then 7 months old, died of sudden infant death syndrome. On a day like this, Mrs. Williamson-Noble said, she and her husband could not help thinking of what might have been had he lived.</p>
        <p>Then her mood swung back to one of smiles as she turned to Robert. ''Tell everyone what you learned here,'' she said. Robert replied: ''I'm learning to be nice to people. That's the most important thing.''</p>
