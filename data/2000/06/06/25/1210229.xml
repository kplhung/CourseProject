        <p>FEW issues point up the ideological gulf between the likely major-party presidential candidates more clearly than their approaches to inducing Americans to save more for retirement.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore, the Democrat, wants the government to provide a subsidy of as much as $3 for each $1 that a worker kicks in to his or her retirement kitty; this proposed new entitlement program is intended to favor the relative have-nots. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the tax-cutting Republican, will probably endorse a plan under which the kitty will be fattened by redirecting taxes that now help finance Social Security.</p>
        <p>The two sides have in common a recognition that voters want Social Security's long-term health to be seriously debated, not avoided as taboo. And they share a belief that shortfalls in retirement security are best made up in the financial markets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was first to publicly sketch out a plan. But Mr. Gore, who used to attack the idea of investing Social Security money in stocks, has laid out his proposal in much greater detail.</p>
        <p>Now that the debate has been joined in earnest, some investment advisers have begun tentatively sizing up the competing plans, neither of which is yet concrete enough to reward close financial scrutiny. Indeed, Mr. Bush has yet to provide the most crucial single number: the portion of the 12.4 percent Social Security tax, half of which is paid by employers, that he would divert into private investment accounts. That, he contends, is a job for legislators.</p>
        <p>Despite the vagueness, though, one preliminary finding has emerged: Assuming that cash can be spared to take advantage of the government's matching offer, for most people Mr. Gore offers more.</p>
        <p>''The Gore plan would be better,'' at least in terms of the greatest benefit for the greatest number, said Thomas P. Ochsenschlager, a specialist in personal taxation in the Arlington, Va., office of Grant Thornton, the accounting firm. He pointed to the way it would give a couple earning $30,000 a year and able to save $1,000 in the plan an extra $3,000 in matching money, and to how it would leave existing Social Security benefits unchanged.</p>
        <p>BUT the Gore plan becomes much less attractive as incomes rise, with the matching money dwindling to zero for households earning more than $100,000. Other advisers, looking beyond the raw figures, take a dimmer view.</p>
        <p>''My clients would be hard-pressed to see that they would benefit from the Gore plan,'' said Carol I. Johnson, a financial planner at Voellinger, Simpson &amp; Associates, an accounting firm in Belleville, Ill. She said this group, 30 percent of whom have household incomes of less than $100,000, are more interested in ensuring the solvency of Social Security, which is neither ''fixed'' nor undermined by the Gore plan, than they are in a new entitlement program.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Gore's proposal, which would be voluntary and phased in over 10 years, the government's match would take the form of a tax credit -- a dollar-for-dollar reduction in income tax. The credit would be refundable, meaning that if it exceeded your income tax liability, the Treasury would write you a check for the difference.</p>
        <p>Your money would be pooled with the government's in a tax-deferred account managed by professionals who would invest it broadly, avoiding individual stocks. A typical household could expect the account to swell to about $200,000 over 35 years, according to plan's architects. Funds could be tapped without penalty for college tuition, heavy medical expenses or a first home.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is much bolder, proposing to modify the Social Security system itself, an initiative that he will bill as addressing impending shortfalls in the system's finances but critics say could instead put the system in greater jeopardy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has said he wants to let workers divert an unspecified share of the Social Security taxes that they and their employers pay into self-managed personal accounts. In return, the workers would agree to accept a smaller guaranteed retirement benefit from Social Security, which would be deprived of the diverted revenue.</p>
        <p>A wide variety of specific proposals could fit into what Mr. Bush calls his ''framework.'' But one plan that is being promoted by a close Bush adviser, Martin S. Feldstein of Harvard University, is a suitable proxy. Dr. Feldstein would have the government deposit 2 percent of each individual's income into a privately managed portfolio, three-fifths invested in stocks and two-fifths in corporate bonds, a mix that would have yielded a 6 percent annual return, adjusted for inflation, over the last 50 years.</p>
        <p>Dr. Feldstein, who served as chief economic adviser to the Reagan Administration, calculates that a 21-year-old who follows this plan to retirement would have an even chance of beating the currently projected Social Security benefit by at least one-third. Conversely, he figures that the chances of winding up with less than 90 percent of what Social Security alone would have yielded are below 1 in 10.</p>
        <p>WHILE financial planners say it is not yet possible to compare the plans with any rigor, they tend to prefer that of Mr. Bush, perhaps because it is skewed to mainly benefit the well-to-do who are their main clients.</p>
        <p>''The 60-40 plan sounds better,'' said W. Michael Cooper, a planner in Lexington, Ky. ''This business about the tax credit I'm not comfortable with,'' he added, citing administrative complexity and opportunity for fraud, among other factors.</p>
        <p>Steve Garrett, manager of financial planning services at A. G. Edwards, the St. Louis-based brokerage firm, said he doubted whether lower-income families could muster even the modest amount of cash needed to qualify for Mr. Gore's credits.</p>
        <p>Many workers taking part in the Gore plan would do so with money otherwise destined for 401(k) plans, which would throw the balance of lower-paid and higher-paid workers in such plans out of kilter and severely limit employers' ability to offer them, according to Dan Halpin, a benefits specialist with Grant Thornton.</p>
        <p>Paul A. Levis of Summit Financial Consultants in Yonkers said that even the Bush-Feldstein plan, with its 40 percent bond requirement, would be too timidly invested for his taste. Referring to his daughter, Ashlie, who recently graduated from college, he asked, ''Why not give her the ability to put 100 percent'' in stock mutual funds?</p>
        <p>Then there was Mary B. Hevener, a payroll tax expert for Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, who said she was ''hard-pressed to say which one is worse,'' a generous-to-the-poor Gore plan that seems to invite wholesale cheating or a Bush plan that she said risks aggravating, rather than reducing, the threat posed to the Social Security System by the aging of the baby boom generation.</p>
        <p>''The richer and older you are, the more you're going to go toward Bush,'' Ms. Hevener said, but ''the crooks are going to like Gore better.''</p>
