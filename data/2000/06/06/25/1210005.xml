      <block class="full_text">
        <p>CLAD in his bright yellow athletic warm-up suit, Tommy Hilfiger skull cap, sunglasses and dangling gold chains, the British cult comic character Ali G conducted one of his trademark hoax interviews on his hit late-night television program here with Tony Benn, a longtime member of Parliament and ardent socialist, completely straight-faced.</p>
        <p>''These unemployed -- they just chillin' innit, man?'' he quizzed a serious-looking Mr. Benn, who appeared thrown by his seemingly black interviewer's unusual style of questioning and choice of clothing. ''Is goin' on strike jus' like 'avin' a sickie?''</p>
        <p>Without a hint of laughter, Ali G probed further. ''Does welfare not just encourage young girls to go out and get jiggy with Mr. Biggy?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Benn was clearly not in on the joke, in part because he was the punch line, and in part because the comedian who plays Ali G is not a black product of the inner city; he is a white, Jewish graduate of Cambridge University.</p>
        <p>But Ali G's audience ate up the segment, repeating bits from the interview at pubs around town for weeks, making ''Mr. Biggy'' a momentary pop-culture reference among the 20-something generation.</p>
        <p>The politician acknowledged after the prank interview that he never realized he was being duped.</p>
        <p>Mr. Benn has not been the only one to fall for the tongue-in-cheek antics of Ali G, who has become the television icon of the moment here. A long line of well-known politicians and academics have been suckered. On a trip to the United States, Ali G asked an unsuspecting Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr., the former secretary of state, ''Is it true that Reagan and Thatcher was doin' it?'' He followed up with, ''Do you t'ink it's worth nukin' Russia now, while it's weak?''</p>
        <p>Played by 28-year-old Sacha Baron Cohen from North London, the Ali G character tries to mock young, white, middle-class suburban men who presume to act stereotypically black, as well as the way in which an older generation reacts to them. His language is a potpourri of American gangsta rap and the Indian and Caribbean accents of the British working class. Mr. Baron Cohen even created a fictitious gang, laughingly called Staines Massive (after the London suburb of Staines), which, of course, is led by Ali G.</p>
        <p>The Ali G character has become a lightning rod for praise and controversy, stirring the English to applaud Ali G, who represents a new form of comedy that speaks to a younger generation, and at the same time to condemn the character as another example of racism that has sadly been accepted by a broad and impressionable audience.</p>
        <p>The character was created two years ago for several segments on a late-night comedy program called ''The 11 O'Clock Show'' on Channel 4. The Ali G character, who duped unsuspecting public figures into interviews under the pretense that he was the host of a public affairs program for teenagers, became so popular that an entire weekly television series, ''Da Ali G Show,'' was built around the character by the same network. A home video of the original Ali G segments has become a top seller in Britain, and another video may be on its way.</p>
        <p>His shtick has hit such a nerve that Mr. Baron Cohen is set to appear in Madonna's next music video as Ali G and is working on a script for the movie production company Working Title, which made ''Four Weddings and a Funeral'' and ''Notting Hill,'' about making a movie based on the Ali G character.</p>
        <p>It remains unclear whether Mr. Baron Cohen's brand of humor can attract a broad audience beyond Britain and whether it would be accepted without protest elsewhere. While there have been reports here that Talkback Productions, which produces ''Da Ali G Show,'' may try to take the program across the Atlantic, it will almost surely receive an onslaught of criticism from a multitude of minority groups.</p>
        <p>Here in England, the Ali G character has come under attack in some circles. Mr. Baron Cohen has received death threats and is regularly condemned in the press. ''The fact that he has been a success should not be treated as an excuse to quash discussion about the propriety of the act,'' a commentator wrote recently in the daily newspaper The Guardian. ''If the black and white minstrels weren't funny, then why is Ali G?''</p>
        <p>But Ali G's defenders say the act is less about poking fun at minority stereotypes than mocking ignorant whites. ''He is about a white kid pretending to be black,'' said a spokesman for Channel 4. ''He is satirizing the way white kids try to copy the black street culture and look ridiculous. If it's offensive to anyone, it's offensive to white people.''</p>
        <p>Harry Thompson, co-creator and producer of ''Da Ali G Show,'' believes the Ali G character just follows the model of a long list of comedians who have successfully inspired laughs through a bit of racism in Britain.</p>
        <p>''Just as Alf Garnett became a hero to bad-tempered racists in the 1960's, and Loadsamoney inspired London football fans to wave wads of cash at their northern counterparts in the 1980's, so Ali has become a cultural magnet for inarticulate youth in the 2000's,'' Mr. Thompson wrote in The Sunday Times.</p>
        <p>''It's a perverse but welcome accolade for one of the most brilliant comic talents that I've ever encountered.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baron Cohen refused to be interviewed for this article. In fact, his agent and production company were so worried that Mr. Baron Cohen would become recognizable in the United States because of media coverage -- and therefore unable to successfully pull pranks on future interview subjects -- that they refused to provide ''production'' photos of Ali G in full garb regularly handed out to British media organizations, or allow photographs to be taken of him as Ali G. (The picture that accompanies this article was obtained from a photo agency.)</p>
        <p>But Ali G's cover may not be blown after all. In one of the better-known segments, he is dragged away from an environmental protest by a policeman. ''Is it because I's black?'' he says. Without even a second glance, the officer replies, ''Not at all.''</p>
