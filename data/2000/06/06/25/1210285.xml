        <p>WHEN Al Gore's college transcript found its way into the press recently, it seemed destined to ignite a firestorm. Now the world knew: the prep school boy who applied only to Harvard, the wonky vice president, the learned president-in-waiting, had actually been a C student for a time at Harvard. He even got a D in biology.</p>
        <p>But nobody in Mr. Gore's camp acted terribly agitated by the revelations. And before long, the whispers started: could the campaign itself have leaked the transcript?</p>
        <p>The campaign denies the accusation, but it's a peculiarly American phenomenon that a candidate might advertise his academic stumbles. In fact, just as a recurring theme in this presidential race has been whether Gov. George W. Bush has the intellect to be a successful president, so some Gore advisers worry that their candidate may come off, as President Harry Truman would put it, as too much of ''a smarty.''</p>
        <p>A number of politicians of recent vintage -- from Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota to Ronald Reagan to Ross Perot -- have been known more for their street smarts or down-to-earth personalities than their intellectual curiosity. It was no accident that during the Republican primaries, Senator John McCain reminded crowds that he graduated at the bottom of his class at the Naval Academy.</p>
        <p>There is a sense among some scholars, too, that smarties make lousy presidents. Most historians agree that the last president who was an intellectual was Woodrow Wilson, and some think he was too much of a thinker to turn the wheels of government.</p>
        <p>Anti-intellectualism is one of the more venerable traits of American voters. It's not that they don't respect smart politicians; it's that they do not always respect politicians who act smart. Instead, voters trust those who seem more like themselves, even if those politicians are masking their intelligence to better appeal to common folk.</p>
        <p>''We now expect a much more personable person in the White House,'' said Fred Greenstein, a professor of history at Princeton University. ''We are much more open to a normal, laid-back, colloquial style. George Washington was a figure who never smiled, and by modern standards would make Al Gore look like the life of the party.''</p>
        <p>The question for many voters, it seems, is not whether a leader can recite from the classics or is a whiz at math but whether he or she seems sober-minded and possessed of enough common sense to make sound decisions and relate easily to people.</p>
        <p>In this environment, Mr. Gore has found that his command of policy, and his willingness to display it, can be as much a political liability as an asset. Mr. Bush still must persuade voters that he has a sufficient grasp of policy -- or, to put it bluntly, that he is not a dumbbell -- but polls show he is drawing higher and higher marks for leadership. That leaves Mr. Gore with the arguably tougher job of proving that he is not a condescending smarty-pants.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Bush seems to have had success convincing Americans that you don't have to like reading books to be intelligent. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released this weekend found that 37 percent of the public thinks Mr. Gore is more intelligent, while a statistically indistinguishable 34 percent give the nod to Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the reigning -- and one of the last -- intellectuals in Congress, managed to get elected despite his intellectualism because he played at being the absent-minded professor. His campaign also reminded voters that he grew up an immigrant's son in Hell's Kitchen and worked as a longshoreman.</p>
        <p>''There's a long tradition, and it's appropriate to a democracy, of politicians saying, 'I'm just like you,' '' Mr. Moynihan said. ''Go down the list of senators whose names are Dick, Tom, Al, Joe and not their Christian names, as we used to say. I would have run as Pat Moynihan except we missed the filing day in New York City and they put down my proper name. But I'm happy that we didn't have Frank Roosevelt instead of Franklin D.''</p>
        <p>America didn't exactly start out this way. The founding fathers were much in the British mode of gentlemen of means and leisure, using both to get a classical education. Not only did they feel it unnecessary to pander to voters, they felt it far too demeaning to try.</p>
        <p>As America grew more insistently democratic, and populist, the ruling campaign model began to change as well. And with the election of 1828, Andrew Jackson disabused voters entirely of the notion that the president should be an aristocrat from Tidewater Virginia or a Harvard graduate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson was regarded as a boor by the Brahmins of Boston, who were apoplectic when Harvard bestowed an honorary degree on him. John Quincy Adams, an overseer of the school, wrote that it was a disgrace to confer honors upon ''a barbarian who could not write a sentence of grammar and hardly could spell his own name.''</p>
        <p>In the 20th century, Harry Truman was perhaps the president who best combined sagacity and a genuine common touch. David McCullough, the Truman biographer, said: ''He was one of the few presidents who went to the National Symphony fairly often -- and certainly not for a photo opportunity. If they were playing Mozart or Chopin, he would often take the score with him.''</p>
        <p>His instincts were infinitely sharper than those of Adlai Stevenson, whose reading and speaking habits nearly caused American intellectuals to swoon with joy at the thought of his occupying the Oval Office. He never did, of course, and one reason may be that he lacked Truman's everyday appeal.</p>
        <p>The story goes that during the 1952 presidential campaign, a woman rushed up to Mr. Stevenson (who, famously, was derided by Dwight Eisenhower's loyalists as an ''egghead'') after one of his speeches. ''Mr. Stevenson,'' she said. ''You have captured the vote of every thinking person in America!'' Mr. Stevenson was not heartened. ''Ma'am,'' he replied. ''We need a majority!'' How charming -- and how haughty.</p>
        <p>More recently, could it be mere coincidence that Speaker Newt Gingrich, who liked to compare Mr. Clinton's behavior in office to the forces that led the Roman republic to ruin, has been replaced by a former high school wrestling coach? Or that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who likes to invoke Teilhard de Chardin (the paleontologist and philosopher), was ousted by the unassuming Gov. George E. Pataki, who is more inclined  to chat passionately about the Rolling Stones than his Yale credentials?</p>
        <p>These politicians may also be tapping into American society's increasing glorification of, well, stupidity. People do not get much credit these days for being brainy. The British complain that the questions on the television hit ''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' in the United States are far easier than those of the program's English counterpart. Bart Simpson, one of the most popular television characters, celebrates being  an underachiever -- ''and proud of it, man!''</p>
        <p>In that spirit, Mr. Gore spent a day last week with Governor Ventura -- his third visit with the governor in four months. This is a former professional wrestler -- known as the Body -- who had a television commercial in his 1998 race that featured him assuming the position of Rodin's ''Thinker,'' clad only in a pair of shorts.</p>
        <p>What then, would be the ideal blend of brains and Bubba for a president? Even one intellectual was stumped.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we have figured out that formulation yet,'' Mr. Moynihan said. ''Wait until the DNA sequencing is done.''</p>
