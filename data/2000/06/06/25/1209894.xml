        <p>DR. JAMES VARGA, a pediatrician, has been in practice in Santa Monica, Calif., for 21 years, enough time for a generation of well-educated, middle- and upper-middle-class parents to have visited his examination room with their children. His diagnosis of those parents: ''Absolutely too permissive.''</p>
        <p>The syndrome, according to Dr. Varga, starts with sleep problems, when the child is 9 to 12 months old. Then comes the tantrums when the child is 2 or 3. By adolescence, it is drugs and alcohol. ''People are not setting limits,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That is almost certainly a prescription for trouble, experts say. Parents may assume that a laissez-faire approach to child raising will make youngsters relaxed, happy and independent. In fact, children read flexibility and a willingness to negotiate as inconsistency, and it makes them nervous. ''When discipline is sacrificed for the 'palness' of the relationship, the child does not feel safe,'' said Dr. Linda Rubinowitz,a clinical psychologist and the director of the Family Institute at Northwestern University, in Evanston, Ill.</p>
        <p>It seems that the parents of today's parents, those strict disciplinarians of the 1950's and early 60's, may have been right all along: father and mother did know best, many psychologists and pediatricians say. But that style of parenting is as out of fashion as last season's pants. Permissiveness fits better, particularly in a world that seems much more threatening than it did a generation ago. Daily life is so full of constraints that many parents are reluctant to introduce more.</p>
        <p>Like fashion, permissiveness is primarily a function of affluence, and the work schedule required to maintain it. Poorer families aspire to discipline but often practice ''permissiveness by default,'' Dr. Rubinowitz said.</p>
        <p>''When you're working on a lower socioeconomic scale, the intent may be to set firm limits, but they end up being permissive because of the complexity of life -- working so many jobs and handling responsibilities on a personal level that a more affluent person would farm out, like shopping or cleaning.''</p>
        <p>Those who can afford to choose are motivated by a number of factors. Dr. Varga, the father of two daughters, ages 13 and 15, blames a strong ''reaction formation'' in some adults who, trying not to recapitulate their parents' authoritarian style, ''end up lopsided the other way.'' In other words, baby boomers who entered adulthood on a wave of rebellion continue to fight the establishment.</p>
        <p>Dr. Varga cites parents who have proudly told him that they smoked marijuana with their children. ''Most parents of teens today have smoked pot, and they don't want to be hypocritical, so most of them are very lenient,'' he said. ''But if parents don't have a position, it's difficult for a kid to figure out what to do.''</p>
        <p>Other parents abandon discipline because they want to enjoy the little time they have to spend with their children. ''With working mothers, there is definitely an issue of guilt,'' Dr. Varga said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rubinowitz said that single parents feel a similar pressure. ''The complexity of life and lifestyle is a constraining factor,'' she said. ''People feel, 'I just don't have the energy, I don't want to have another fight, I have limits myself.' ''</p>
        <p>Overwhelmed adults take what Nancy Samalin, a parent educator in New York City, believes is the path of least resistance. ''Parents want their children to love them, and it's harder to say 'no' than 'yes,' '' she explained, ''especially if you've been working all day and you're tired.''</p>
        <p>The technology that makes the universe one big chat room can also make it harder to converse at the dinner table. ''The nuclear family used to have dinner and then perhaps watch a family program on TV together,'' said Reveta Bowers, the head of school at the Center for Early Education in Los Angeles, a private elementary school where families include celebrities, dual-career couples and those receiving financial aid. ''Now they all go off to their own rooms, to the computer. Even the poorest families have TV's.''</p>
        <p>The autonomy that technology encourages has undermined the family, Ms. Bowers said, noting, ''Everyone does what feels best for them.''</p>
        <p>As a result, Ms. Samalin and other experts say, children are making too many decisions, often subsidized by money, which is easier to hand out than attention.</p>
        <p>Vicky Mann is a middle-school teacher on Mercer Island, a middle-class suburb of Seattle, and the mother of two daughters, 13 and 11. Mrs. Mann said she was appalled when her seventh-grade students circulated a petition challenging a school dress code that forbade spaghetti-strap tops and dresses at a  dance. She has never let her daughters wear such revealing clothes. What did it mean that her preteen students wanted them so badly?</p>
        <p>''I don't think parents are involved,'' Mrs. Mann said. ''I assume they just give the kids money to go shopping at the mall, and they come home with clothes meant for older girls. The parents think it's fashionable, and they think of themselves as hipper than their parents were. So they don't institute rules.''</p>
        <p>She tells her own children that they cannot wear clothes that ''advertise'' a young body, ''and my girls go along with me because I give them a reason.'' Which is that it is inappropriate for girls to dress in such revealing styles.</p>
        <p>In the absence of parents' putting on the behavioral brakes, schools are increasingly assuming the traditional parental role. ''Schools now make rules,'' Ms. Bowers said, ''which in many instances are the only rules that are not open to arbitration or negotiation.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''What children really need is guidance and love and support. We expect them to act more and more like adults, while we act more and more like children. Then, when we're ready to act like parents, they bristle at the retaking of authority.''</p>
        <p>Among her students' families, permissiveness can become a competitive sport. Indeed, two years ago, she  sent out a note asking people to tone down birthday parties. ''There's this formula -- the rentals, the trained acts,'' Ms. Bower said. ''It's how we express our love, rather than putting our arms around them and saying 'no' in a loving way.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Rubinowitz said that no is often the most loving thing a parent can say. ''It gives the child a sense that you really understand what's going on,'' she explained. ''And it gives the child a way to deal with a problem in a social context. You can tell them, 'Say your mom and dad won't let you do it, and grumble if you want.' That's face-saving for the child.''</p>
        <p>There are signs of a backlash among wealthier parents. Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, who are film producers whose credits include the Oscar-nominated ''Sixth Sense'' and ''E. T.,'' could underwrite all manner of permissiveness with their two daughters, Lili, 3 1/2,  and Meghan, 15 months. But they have decided not to.</p>
        <p>''We originally designed the kids' rooms so we could put TV's in them,'' Ms. Kennedy said. Instead, the television and computers will be installed in a communal space in the house because, Ms. Kennedy said, ''I want to know what they watch and have some control; I'm a big believer in boundaries and discipline.''</p>
        <p>The challenge, as Ms. Kennedy sees it, is to figure out how to be strict in a world that has far more rules than when she grew up. ''The seeds of my imagination and creativity came from the fact that I could say, 'Hey, see you later,' and our parents didn't worry about it,'' she said. ''They'd just say, 'Be home in time for dinner,' and I'd be off on my bike. But today, you can't send your kids riding their bikes in the canyon alone, because it isn't safe.''</p>
        <p>The old freedoms have become casualties of fear related to teenage violence, drugs and alcohol; the sexual revolution that the current generation of parents lived through now has life-or-death consequences. Ms. Kennedy's children spend more time under adult supervision than she ever did, and she wonders how children will learn to be independent.</p>
        <p>As Dr. Rubinowitz said, ''This is the challenge for this generation -- to find ways to enable a child to develop her own judgment without a created structure around her, to find ways to 'work in' experiences that allow more flexibility.</p>
        <p>''The umbilical cord stretches,'' she concluded, ''but I do think it's a harder world.''</p>
