        <p>A dozen school districts held second votes this week on revised versions of budgets and bond referendums that had been defeated in May.</p>
        <p>In most school districts the budgets were passed, but in Glen Cove and West Islip, they were defeated for a second time, and those districts will have to make more drastic cuts.</p>
        <p>In Suffolk, bonds were approved in Brentwood, Center Moriches, Connetquot and East Islip for projects that will address rising student enrolment and aging buildings. In Nassau, voters supported revised bonds in Hewlett-Woodmere and Mineola.</p>
        <p>''I'm greatly relieved,'' Mineola's superintendent, Harry Jaroslaw, said. ''Reducing our bond by $12 million forced us to make some hard choices, but the core remained.''</p>
        <p>Reduced budgets were approved in Babylon, Elwood, Farmingdale, Longwood, Patchogue-Medford, Three Village and Port Washington.</p>
        <p>In Port Washington, after the initial defeat for both the budget and a much-debated bond, voters approved a drastically reduced budget. The bond was delayed until the fall.</p>
        <p>Superintendent Albert Inserra said, ''I'm delighted that the budget passed, but I remain concerned that this budget did get some severe cuts, especially with the elimination of two portable classrooms for the middle school that we desperately need.''</p>
        <p>The picture after the budget defeat in Glen Cove was grimmer. ''We will now be forced to bring our budget in line with caps that were put in place by the state Legislature,'' said Frank Fiumano, business manager for the district. ''For Glen Cove, this will mean all equipment and capital projects will be automatically cut.''</p>
