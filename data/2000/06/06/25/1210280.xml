        <p>Rooting for Al Gore and the Democrats in Texas these days can be as dangerous as rooting for the 49ers at a Dallas Cowboys home game. Especially when your boss is Michael Dell, an ardent Republican.</p>
        <p>But on Monday night, Thomas J. Meredith, the former chief financial officer of Dell Computer and now a managing director of the Dell Ventures unit, raised more than $800,000 for the Democrats at his home in Austin, with the help of President Clinton. Roy Spence, a founder of Austin's GSD &amp; M advertising agency, now owned by Omnicom, raised an additional $125,000 or so at his home.</p>
        <p>Reflecting on Mr. Meredith's willingness to raise money for the party of George W. Bush's rival, Mr. Spence recalls telling him, ''That's a brave thing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Meredith, noting his circumstances, replied, according to Mr. Spence: ''When you got a billion dollars, you can be brave.''</p>
        <p>In seeking to recruit employees, Mr. Spence's Web site, gsdm.com, asks visitors if they are creative. Click ''yes'' and you get a fill-in-the-blanks application letter. Click ''no'' and you end up at www.irs.gov.</p>
