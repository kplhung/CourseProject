        <p>They call him the fund-raiser in chief. The money man. The closer. The Democratic Party's biggest draw, elder statesman, marquee attraction. Put him on the bill. Lead him to the podium. Wallets will open.</p>
        <p>President Clinton may not be on the ballot in the fall, but he is raising campaign money as though Election Day were tomorrow and his party's life depended on a huge cash infusion. He works his magic in hotel ballrooms, exclusive nightclubs and tony dining rooms from coast to coast, wherever he can find Democrats willing to give.</p>
        <p>''It really is extraordinary that the president, in his eighth year of office, is out on the road doing this,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who joined Mr. Clinton on Thursday night at the Ritz-Carlton in Phoenix for a swank fund-raising reception for the Democratic National Convention. The event took in about $350,000, making it the biggest fund-raising event ever for Arizona Democrats.</p>
        <p>But that was just one of many stops for Mr. Clinton, whose frenetic fund-raising pace this week alone helped bring in $4 million for the Democrats at a dozen events in just four days.</p>
        <p>A portion of the money went to Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose New York Senate campaign received $200,000 from a fund-raiser at which Mr. Clinton was the host on Wednesday night at a private home in Washington. The Democratic National Committee, which is using its money for issue advertisements promoting Vice President Al Gore's candidacy, received well over $1 million from fund-raisers Mr. Clinton attended in Phoenix and San Diego on Thursday and Los Angeles on Friday.</p>
        <p>In his 1996 re-election bid, Mr. Clinton set the standard for aggressive fund-raising with a relentless series of coffees, lunches, dinners and late-night receptions in the months before the election. All the money-raising helped him hold onto the White House, but the ensuing controversies surrounding illegal funds haunted his administration for years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who assisted with the effort back in 1996, still faces questions from Justice Department investigators about his stop at the Hsi Lai Buddhist temple, a visit the vice president has insisted was finance-related but not a true fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>It is the memory of 1996 that, in part, keeps Mr. Clinton going at full throttle. Aides say he remembers how much time he spent on fund-raising as a presidential candidate when he should have been out shaking hands and talking policy. By doing some of the heavy lifting himself this time, the aides say, Mr. Clinton hopes he can free Mr. Gore and other Democratic candidates from the onerous task of raising money.</p>
        <p>''He feels fund-raising took too much of his time in '96,'' said Jake Siewert, a former Clinton-Gore campaign worker who is now the president's deputy press secretary. ''He wants Gore to be able to collect votes instead of money.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's pitch typically ignores money altogether. He may thank donors for their contributions to the party, but the arm-twisting for big checks is done before he arrives by seasoned fund-raisers like Terry McAuliffe, who recently took over fund-raising for the cash-strapped Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's travels this week benefited many Democrats.</p>
        <p>Susan Davis, a California assemblywoman who is taking on Representative Brian P. Bilbray, received $125,000 from a fund-raiser Mr. Clinton headlined at the El Cortez Hotel in San Diego. Ms. Davis, who was occupied with legislative business in Sacramento on Thursday night, did not attend her own gala.</p>
        <p>Senator Dianne Feinstein, who is building a war chest to keep her opponent, Representative Tom Campbell of California, at bay, netted $550,000 from two Clinton-attended events in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The California Democratic Party emerged $112,000 richer after Mr. Clinton spoke on Friday at a rousing reception at the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Convention Host Committee also benefited from the president's latest fund-raising swing, taking in $25,000 from enough couples at an event this morning to amass $1.5 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton clearly relishes the road. Outside Washington, where his relevance is sometimes questioned as legislative stalemates keep much of his agenda in check, there is already a nostalgia setting in among the almost ex-president's supporters.</p>
        <p>In Los Angeles, Mr. Clinton told members of the state party it was fitting that the Democrats were holding what would be his ''farewell convention'' in the key state of California. ''Awwww,'' the audience replied, clearly sorry to see him go. ''I'm not going to shrivel up,'' Mr. Clinton replied with a laugh. ''I'll be around.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes, Mr. Clinton is in top form, as he was late Friday when he turned conversational during an appearance at the home of Kenneth Edmonds, the music producer and singer better known as Babyface. The audience -- a star-studded crowd that included the model Naomi Campbell, the boxer Evander Holyfield and the singers Lionel Richie and Chaka Khan -- seemed to hang on every presidential word.</p>
        <p>Earlier that evening, Mr. Clinton spoke at an exclusive nightclub called Garden of Eden, the sort of place that picks out pretty people from the line out front but turns away most people not on the list. There, the stylish crowd of young Democrats ignored most of Mr. Clinton's oft-delivered applause lines and seemed to agree completely when the president said, ''Now, look, you all came here to have a good time and you probably don't want to hear a political speech.''</p>
        <p>Despite different audiences, Mr. Clinton's spiel is virtually identical at every stop: The current prosperity may not last and should not be squandered with tax cuts. Mr. Gore, the president says, is better positioned to keep the good times rolling.</p>
