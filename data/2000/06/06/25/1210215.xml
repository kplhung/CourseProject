        <p>I SHOULD have gotten my pole beans in by early May, but the weather didn't cooperate. Every time I got down to the farm, it rained buckets, and the ground was like cement. The fine, sunny weekends came when I was off seeing someone else's garden. So it was mid-June before I got my seeds in the ground. Which is plenty of time for a bush bean like Royal Burgundy, which only takes 60 days, but pole beans, which grow on vines that like to wind up strings or trellises, often take more like 70 or 80 days to mature. And since they keep coming, as long as you pick them, all summer long, it's a shame to lose a month to the vagaries of weather and the gardener.</p>
        <p>But one lovely event, and that's what it feels like, is my soil, which is full of earthworms and a lot more workable thanks to a cover crop of hairy vetch I planted in early September. I scattered the seed over the old vegetable patch and it grew for two months before winter set in, then picked up and was about a foot tall by early May when we cut it down and turned it into the soil.</p>

        <p>I SHOULD have gotten my pole beans in by early May, but the weather didn't cooperate. Every time I got down to the farm, it rained buckets, and the ground was like cement. The fine, sunny weekends came when I was off seeing someone else's garden. So it was mid-June before I got my seeds in the ground. Which is plenty of time for a bush bean like Royal Burgundy, which only takes 60 days, but pole beans, which grow on vines that like to wind up strings or trellises, often take more like 70 or 80 days to mature. And since they keep coming, as long as you pick them, all summer long, it's a shame to lose a month to the vagaries of weather and the gardener.</p>
        <p>But one lovely event, and that's what it feels like, is my soil, which is full of earthworms and a lot more workable thanks to a cover crop of hairy vetch I planted in early September. I scattered the seed over the old vegetable patch and it grew for two months before winter set in, then picked up and was about a foot tall by early May when we cut it down and turned it into the soil.</p>
        <p>Hairy vetch is a legume. Like the beans I planted, it can take nitrogen from the air and, with the help of nitrogen-fixing bacteria that colonize its roots, turn that gas into a form of nitrogen usable to the plant. It also releases nitrogen into the soil through its roots, which is why just growing beans or peas can fertilize your ground.</p>
        <p>In the third century B.C., Theophrastus wrote that the Greeks planted broad beans to improve the soil. So I'm in good company.</p>
        <p>If you aren't familiar with beanology, snap beans are so crunchy they snap, and are eaten pod and all; haricots verts, or fillet beans, are bred to be slender and should be picked pencil-thin; Italian Romano varieties are long, flat-podded types, which can be eaten pod and all, shelled as fresh beans or left on the vines to dry.</p>
        <p>I'm concentrating on pole beans this summer because they look so pretty on trellises, where you can see their various-colored blossoms, and they have a real beany taste, which makes bush beans pale by comparison. Bush beans also give up the ghost after a few pickings, after which you have to pull them up and start another crop in another part of the garden. I'm getting too lazy to do anything I can avoid -- so pole beans seem the far better choice.</p>
        <p>You can eat pole beans fresh, or let them dry on the vine and shell them for use all winter. They look beautiful in big glass jars, and it makes me feel good to think I can eat yummy beans grown without pesticides.</p>
        <p>Ellen and Shepherd Ogden, the founders of Cook's Garden in Londonderry, Vt., think pole beans are so delicious they don't even bother with bush beans anymore. And I've planted a few of their favorites.</p>
        <p>Trionfo Violetto is an Italian heirloom with dark green, purple-veined leaves and lavender flowers. The deep purple, flavorful bean will keep its color, Mr. Ogden says, if you boil it less than two minutes.</p>
        <p>Kwintus is a long, flat-podded bean in the Romano type. ''It bears as soon as a bush bean, but it keeps going all summer,'' Mr. Ogden said. ''And no matter how big they get, the beans are still good.''</p>
        <p>Borlotto is a brown speckled bean that grows in multicolored pods 8 to 12 inches long. It's as close as Mrs. Ogden could get to a bean called Lamon, which is sold in the Venetian marketplace and is used in pasta e fagioli, the classic pasta and bean dish that goes right to the hips. ''It's a meaty bean with a flavor reminiscent of a chestnut,'' Mrs. Ogden said.</p>
        <p>I've also planted Musica, an eight-inch Romano type hailed for its sweet, delicious flavor. (Territorial Seeds, in Cottage Grove, Ore. -- 541-942-9547 -- calls it the ''finest Romano pole bean we've ever trialed.'') And two runner beans: Painted Lady, which has red and white blossoms attractive to hummingbirds, and bears beautifully mottled purple and white beans; and Scarlet Runner, which has red blossoms and beans mottled with shades of violet, red and black. First described in 1750, it's one of the oldest runner beans in existence, according to the Seed Savers Exchange, in Decorah, Iowa. You can eat the pods and the fresh beans, and cook the dried ones with a chunk of smoked ham all afternoon on a winter's day.</p>
        <p>The Seed Savers Exchange has a vast collection of seeds, thanks in part to the late John Withee, who lived in Lynnfield, Mass., and was known as ''the Bean Man.'' He gave the exchange his collection of 1,186 strains of beans in 1981. If you join the exchange, you will receive a yearly handbook on the current year's seed offerings (information, 319-382-5990), and you can also trade your own heirloom seeds with other members.</p>
        <p>I'm experimenting with trellises, too. Some are bamboo tepees set six feet apart, with a single bamboo pole lashed across the top. I've hung some with netting (with the large square holes), and some with sturdy hemp twine, strung horizontally and vertically. Gardener's Supply Company (800-863-1700), in Burlington, Vt., has a good selection of such materials. I've made other trellises out of sturdy posts, 10 feet long, sunk a foot into the ground, and stretched twine across the top. When the bean plants appear, I'll give each one a vertical string to wind up. We'll see which trellises fare better in the first windy storm.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, my dog, Red, has done battle with the groundhogs. But if you don't have a dog, just get a fence, because rabbits and groundhogs happen to love beans as much as people do.</p>
