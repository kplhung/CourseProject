        <p>Considering that on successive days, the two recognized contenders for the American League East championship lost games by scores of 17-4 and 22-1, that the Toronto Blue Jays, in the space of six recent games, lost by scores of 16-3 and 18-6 should not rule them out as a third contender for that title.</p>

        <p>Considering that on successive days, the two recognized contenders for the American League East championship lost games by scores of 17-4 and 22-1, that the Toronto Blue Jays, in the space of six recent games, lost by scores of 16-3 and 18-6 should not rule them out as a third contender for that title.</p>
        <p>''We definitely have a chance,'' Carlos Delgado, the team's mass weapon of opposing pitchers' destruction, said.</p>
        <p>''We're for real; absolutely,'' Gord Ash, the general manager, proclaimed, then readily acknowledged that the Blue Jays have benefited from the inconsistent performances of the Yankees and the Red Sox.</p>
        <p>''We're not fooling ourselves,'' Ash added. ''The Yankees and Red Sox have played probably more poorly than anyone anticipated and given us a chance to contend. But given the circumstances, we think we can compete with them.''</p>
        <p>The Blue Jays are in first place, a game ahead of the Yankees, a game and a half in front of the Red Sox, after beating Boston yesterday for the second time in their three-game series in Toronto. The Blue Jays were four games from first before winning 13 of their last 18 games, including two games in each of six successive series. When that stretch began, the other two teams were tied for first, but since then the Yankees have won only 8 of 18 games and the Red Sox 8 of 19.</p>
        <p>If those expected contenders have been inconsistent, the Blue Jays have been a contradiction. They have one of the best-hitting and highest-scoring teams in the league, but they have given up more runs than they have scored. They have the pitcher with the most victories in the majors, but the pitching staff has allowed the most hits and has the league's third-worst earned run average.</p>
        <p>Delgado and David Wells are the primary reasons the Blue Jays are in position to challenge the Yankees and the Red Sox, though Delgado has had more help from other hitters than Wells has from other pitchers. Delgado, who chose to remain in Toronto after his good friend Shawn Green was traded to Los Angeles, is one of the most fearsome hitters in the league. He drove in three runs yesterday in Toronto's 6-4 victory.</p>
        <p>Entering yesterday's games, he led the league in home runs (25) and slugging percentage (.714); he was second or tied for second in on-base percentage (.469), runs scored (61), total bases (190), extra-base hits (45) and walks (53); and he was fifth in hits (95), tied for fifth in batting average (.357) and seventh in runs batted in (66).</p>
        <p>''I was very happy to come back,'' said Delgado, who could have become a free agent after this season. ''At some point in your career, you have some leverage. You have to weigh your options. I don't think I sacrificed anything. If I did, I'm happy with the way things have worked out.''</p>
        <p>Wells was not happy with his trade by the Yankees to Toronto last year, but he has flourished there nonetheless. Following a 17-10 record last season, the portly portsider is 12-2. His 3.55 earned run average is No. 2 in the A.L. among pitchers whose name is not Pedro Martinez.</p>
        <p>But like the team, Wells has been a contradiction. He has allowed the most hits in the league (126), but also has the best walk ratio (1.2 per nine innings) with 14 walks in 106 1/3 innings. Since the trade for Roger Clemens, Wells has compiled a 29-12 record, Clemens 18-16. ''He's having a great year,'' Ash said. ''I think he's relishing the role, in his own unique way, of being the leader of this group. He came out in spring training and said some negative things about the club and the players.</p>
        <p>''To his credit, 30 days later, he did an about-face after he saw them compete. Ever since he's been the go-to guy. Probably the most impressive thing about David this year is the number of times he's been out there without his best stuff and he has battled and kept us in the game.''</p>
        <p>But Wells is the only pitcher with a winning record in Toronto's rotation, which includes two young right-handers, Chris Carpenter and Kelvim Escobar, and a journeyman, Frank Castillo, but no steady fifth starter.</p>
        <p>The spot belonged to Roy Halladay, another young right-hander, but an 11.97 e.r.a. earned him a trip to the minors after seven starts. He returned yesterday and was the winning pitcher. In his absence, Lance Painter, Peter Munro and Clayton Andrews did not pitch effectively either. Andrews was the starter in a recent 16-3 loss to Detroit. A week later Carpenter was the starter of an 18-6 loss to the Tigers.</p>
        <p>Yes, Ash said, games like that (earlier in the season the Blue Jays lost successive games to Seattle, 17-6 and 19-7) can make him crazy, but he added, ''It's the nature of the game at the moment.''</p>
        <p>With Raul Mondesi, acquired for Green in a swap of right fielders; Shannon Stewart, Tony Batista and Brad Fullmer assisting Delgado, the Blue Jays have done some pummeling of their own. ''Offensively, we're clearly right there with them,'' Ash said, referring to the Yankees and the Red Sox.</p>
        <p>But Ash also expressed the view that the division race would be won by the team with the best pitching staff. ''We're all in trouble,'' he said. ''It's the degree of trouble you're in.''</p>
        <p>Just One of Those Days</p>
        <p>When the Yankees beat Pedro Martinez with a flurry of bases-empty home runs last week, it was suggested that familiarity might have done him in. That is, the Yankees were facing the brilliant Boston pitcher for the third time in 24 days and perhaps benefited from the experience.</p>
        <p>But the Cleveland Indians saw Cal Eldred three times in 28 days, and the Chicago White Sox pitcher beat them every time. His third start against the Indians, in fact, produced the best of Eldred's three performances against them. He shut them out on six hits.</p>
        <p>Another factor could have made the difference in the outcomes experienced by Martinez and Eldred. In Eldred's three games, the White Sox scored a total of 19 runs; in the three Martinez pitched against the Yankees, the Red Sox scored a total of three runs. Eldred allowed six runs; Martinez gave up four and had an earned run average in the three games that was just about a run lower than Eldred's, 1.57 to 2.53.</p>
        <p>Inflated E.R.A. in Atlanta?</p>
        <p>It's not bad enough that John Schuerholz, the Atlanta Braves general manager, has spent the past six months dealing with the fallout from the words that fall out every time John Rocker opens his mouth. Now he has suffered culture shock. The Braves have joined the rest of pitching humanity.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't believe it,'' he said. ''I looked at the stats about two weeks ago. I looked at the earned run averages in the American League and saw they were in the 5's and 6's. Then I looked at the National League and we're over 4. It's so foreign to me. But that is as true a reflection of our pitching times as anything.''</p>
        <p>The Braves last had a season-ending team e.r.a. that began with a 4 in 1990. Leo Mazzone was named the team's pitching coach in the middle of that season and quickly took steps to reduce the e.r.a. From 1992 through last season, the Braves' staff had either the lowest or next-to-lowest e.r.a. in the major leagues. Their 3.63 e.r.a. was the lowest last season.</p>
        <p>They entered last night's game at 4.15, third lowest in the majors but not low enough to suit Schuerholz. ''We're going to try to fix it,'' he said, ''but when you see those stats, you say how are we going to fix it. I'd rather be writing about the problem than trying to fix it.''</p>
        <p>No Help from Reynoso</p>
        <p>Since the second day of their season, Arizona has been out of first in the National League West on only two days, after their April 23 game against San Francisco and their game last Sunday against the Rockies. Armando Reynoso was the Diamondbacks' starter in both games, which were on Sundays. Reynoso pitched a total of two innings in the two games (he faced only seven batters in the first one) and gave up 16 runs and 16 hits.</p>
        <p>A Rule Book Strike Zone?</p>
        <p>By instructing umpires to call the strike zone that is defined in the rule book, Major League Baseball could speed up the pace of games, which has been one of its goals, and potentially reduce the number of home runs and runs, which is not a goal. But Major League Baseball is apparently not prepared to take such a drastic step.</p>
        <p>The upper limit of the rule book strike zone is the midpoint halfway between the top of the shoulders and the top of the uniform pants. When enforced, that point was around the letters on the shirt. The lower limit is the hollow beneath the kneecap.</p>
        <p>That zone, however, shrunk many seasons ago, and umpires now basically use the knees to a point, by edict of the commissioner's office, about two inches above the belt.</p>
        <p>At a negotiating session this season for a labor agreement for the umpires, their representatives reacted to comments they had seen from officials criticizing umpires for not calling pitches correctly.</p>
        <p>''Statements had been made in the papers that when we get an agreement, umpires will call the rule book strike zone,'' John Hirschbeck, the union's president, said, relating a discussion at the session. ''We said, 'Wait a minute, if that's what you want, we'll do that right now. Tell us and we'll do it.' If they said, 'Call the rule book strike zone,' I swear every major league umpire will go out and call armpits to knees.''</p>
        <p>Did officials leap at the chance to enlarge the strike zone? ''They said, 'No, don't do that; we'll do this gradually,' '' Hirschbeck related.</p>
