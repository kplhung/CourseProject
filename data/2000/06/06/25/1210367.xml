        <p>Hans Krause was in the air, somewhere over Virginia, when he heard about the pub. Another pilot, who flies for United, told him there was a place in New York City where the beer was cheap, the customers were airline and the bartender had a huge collection of bras, hanging on a beam above the bottles of vodka and whiskey.</p>
        <p>So the next time Mr. Krause, 32, a pilot for Trans States Airlines, landed in New York, he dropped his things off at the crash pad in Kew Gardens, Queens, that he shares with 13 other pilots and wandered into Yer Man's Irish Pub on Metropolitan  Avenue, main street for people in the airline industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Krause lives in Florida, but he spends three or four days a week in New York. He is among the scores of flight attendants and pilots who have apartments or second homes in Kew Gardens, which is close to both La Guardia and Kennedy Airports. The neighborhood is so full of airline employees that residents call it ''Crew Gardens.''</p>
        <p>The other night Mr. Krause showed up at about 10 p.m. at Yer Man's with a roommate, Dave Zook, who also flies for Trans States. It was Wednesday, airline night at the pub. So anyone who flies -- and the owner of Yer Man's, Jimmy O'Reilly, says he always knows who they are -- gets half-price drinks all night.</p>
        <p>As the crowd swelled with pilots and flight attendants, Mr. Krause moved around the room, greeting friends from Delta, Continental, United, American and T.W.A. Some he has known since he first showed up at the pub four years ago, others he had met just weeks or months before. But as he worked his way around the room, they all seemed like his sisters and brothers.</p>
        <p>''This is a definite subculture,'' said Mr. Krause, on his third beer. ''Being away from home so much, it feels like a family type environment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Krause has spent his 30th birthday, a Thanksgiving and a Christmas at Yer Man's because his flying schedule made it impossible to go home to Vero Beach, Fla., where he has a wife and a 2-month-old baby.</p>
        <p>Mr. Krause said many of the pilots he knows have also got the Yer Man's fever. On his briefcase is a sticker, from Mr. O'Reilly's plentiful selection of Yer Man's paraphernalia, that says, ''Save Water, Drink at Yer Man's.'' Mr. Krause said he had several times found himself in an airline personnel lounge thousands of miles away and noticed the stickers on other pilots' briefcases.</p>
        <p>In the six years since he opened the pub and introduced airline night, Mr. O'Reilly, who is originally from Killarney, Ireland, has become something of a father figure for airline personnel in the neighborhood. (''Yer man,'' Mr. O'Reilly said, is slang in Ireland for ''what's-his-name.'') Almost as soon as he opened up the place, near Lefferts Boulevard, he noticed that Kew Gardens was a hub for airline people.</p>
        <p>''You get to know the look,'' he said. ''Their hair is all nicely done and sometimes they come in here wearing summer clothes in the winter.''</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Reilly knew a good business opportunity when he saw one, but he also thought there was loneliness to the job and that the pilots and flight attendants could use a place to go. Certainly, many of them might want to get away from their apartments, where rooming with 10, 15 or 20 people is routine.</p>
        <p>''I thought I could do something to help them out,'' Mr. O'Reilly said. ''A lot of them are young, and so we watch them.''</p>
        <p>Jennifer Apking, 25, a flight attendant for Delta, was at Yer Man's for the third time the other night, having heard about it from another flight attendant. She has 15 roommates, living in three bedrooms and a living room and sharing one and a half baths. She works six days straight and then has six days off, so her social life gets a little discombobulated, she said.</p>
        <p>The night before, she had stopped into Yer Man's and met a pilot from JetBlue. The two agreed to meet the next night, airline night.</p>
        <p>''It's pretty cool,'' Ms. Apking said, ''Everyone's airline. There's a certain comfort about that.''</p>
        <p>The pilot, Ralph Meyer, stays with 27 other pilots.</p>
        <p>''It's nice when we all get together,'' he said. ''The main thing is we get to mix airlines.''</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Reilly knew three of the working crew members and several others who were ''deadheading,'' or getting a ride but not working, on T.W.A. Flight 800, which exploded off Long Island in July 1996, killing all 230 aboard. Some of the pilots and flight attendants who died in the crash had spent time at the pub, on airline night.</p>
        <p>A few weeks after the crash, Mr. O'Reilly held a benefit at the pub, featuring 18 bands and raising $6,500 for the children of airline employees who died in the crash. In the back of the bar, a plaque is propped against the wall, listing the names of the airline employees who died. ''To the Crew of Flight 800,'' it says, ''From all their friends at Yer Man's Irish Pub.''</p>
        <p>Then there's the bra collection. Mr. O'Reilly somewhat sheepishly explained that he has a certain expertise in the bra removal department and that, if a woman is willing, he can unsnap and remove a bra within 10 seconds, if it's under a short-sleeved shirt. Looking up at the collection, hundreds of them dangling over the bar -- lace, satin and cotton, ranging in size from A cups to double D's -- Mr. O'Reilly said, ''If I had to estimate, I'd say about 60 percent of those came from flight attendants.''</p>
