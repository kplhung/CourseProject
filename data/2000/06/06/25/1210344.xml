        <p>Mexicans call it the six-year curse, that spell that has come over the economy at the end of every recent presidential term to make the currency plunge, interest rates soar and people go broke.</p>
        <p>With elections approaching on July 2, Antonio Gonzalez Perez, 46, who has lived through all of Mexico's cyclical economic traumas since he opened his curtain-making shop 25 years ago, is taking no chances. These days his sewing machine in a workaday suburb of Mexico City is spinning late into the night so he can salt away savings and be ready in case the hex strikes again.</p>
        <p>Yet despite jitters of Mexicans like Mr. Gonzalez, economists are surprisingly united that for once the economy is strong enough to keep any disturbance caused by the handover of power from becoming disaster.</p>
        <p>The reason, they say, is that President Ernesto Zedillo, an economist himself, has spent the last three years reshaping the economy and building armor, as he calls it, around Mexico's finances to shield them from the kind of meltdown that almost sent the country into default when he took office in 1994.</p>
        <p>''The vulnerabilities are not there,'' said Jonathan Heath, a Mexican economist who has written a book about the recurring crises at the end of recent presidents' single six-year terms. ''There are risks,'' he added, ''but they are within the context of the normal risks of an economy.''</p>
        <p>In the past, the enormous concentration of power in the hands of the almost kingly chief executive has made the hand-over exceptionally perilous. Since the mid-1970's, a procession of presidents used that power to further their political aims by overspending and running up the debt -- often behind the veneer of what looked like a sound economy.</p>
        <p>Then, when it came time for the hand-off to a successor, those fiscal weaknesses came abruptly to light,  shattering investors' confidence and sending the peso into a dive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zedillo, however, has had powerful incentives for wanting to leave his successor a healthier country than the one he received from President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.</p>
        <p>After a devaluation just weeks after his inauguration, Mr. Zedillo's first year in office was a nightmare of stricken businesses, lost jobs and paralyzed government programs. He has said that he knows only too well that the economic gains Mexicans make while he is president can be wiped out in a flash after he leaves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salinas's fate also served as a cautionary example. Mexicans were so outraged by the mess he left, he had to leave the country in 1995.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zedillo's determination to achieve a smooth finish will be just as great if an opposition candidate wins the presidency, as could happen for the first time. A president who is not from Mr. Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has controlled Mexico for seven decades, would be even more inclined to blame his predecessor for any economic shocks in the transition.</p>
        <p>''A total overhaul'' is how Abel Beltran del Rio, president of the consulting firm Ciemex-Wefa, describes  Mr. Zedillo's changes. ''The edifice was rebuilt so that it can get through the earthquakes without the crumbling as it did in the past.''</p>
        <p>In 1994, in the final months under Mr. Salinas, Mexico had short-term debts of $40 billion and foreign reserves of $12 billion. Today Mexico has $32 billion in reserves and its short-term debt is insignificant. Mr. Salinas kept the reserves under wraps most of the time. Mr. Zedillo opened things up, so that the vital economic indicators are on view every day. Under Mr. Salinas the peso traded within fixed limits. Now the peso floats with the market, so the government faces a less severe challenge in spending its reserves to defend the currency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zedillo is on track to meet his goal of a budget deficit this year of 1 percent of the gross domestic product. Reforms he promoted have given the central bank authorities leverage to say no to government officials who want to fiddle with the money supply. As a result, Mexico's stubborn inflation has been slowly sliding down toward the official target of under 10 percent this year.</p>
        <p>Buoyed by the North American Free Trade Agreement, foreigners will probably make more than $10 billion in long-lasting investments in factories and businesses this year. The economy steamed forward by 7.9 percent in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>There are a few gray spots on the picture. The $100 billion bank bailout remains a hot political issue and could take unexpected turns. No one is quite sure how Mexico, now fastened at the hip to the American economy, will fare in a slowdown in the United States.</p>
        <p>President Zedillo has not been above stepping up federal spending to help the campaign of Francisco Labastida Ochoa, his party's presidential candidate. Public outlays jumped by 15.4 percent in the first quarter, as the federal government laid hand on money budgeted for the last half of the year and dipped into the windfall from soaring oil prices.</p>
        <p>''With oil prices running so high, Mexico should be running a surplus, and it's not,'' said Walter Molano, head of research at BCP Securities. ''They're spending money based on a volatile revenue source when they should be saving for the time when prices drop.''</p>
        <p>But the real surprise came from the elections. Polls show that Mr. Labastida is tied with Vicente Fox Quesada, a right-of-center opposition candidate.</p>
        <p>The governing party has begun a campaign of machine tactics to sway voters, and the opposition is warning that the election may not be clean.</p>
        <p>The sparring has already created some turbulence in the economy. On June 8, when Mr. Labastida accused Mr. Fox of planning to create ''chaos'' if the opposition candidate lost, the peso dipped from 9.5 to the dollar to over 10. It has since recovered slightly but continues to waver.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gonzalez, the curtain-maker, sees other signs of uneasiness. His suppliers are telling him that the imported toile he uses is out of stock. ''It's speculation,'' he said. ''They're waiting to sell until after the election because they know the price is going up.'' Nonetheless, seasoned Mexico watchers remain sanguine about the basics.</p>
        <p>Luis Rubio, the head of Cidac, a political economics research institution, said, ''This time Mexico could have a political crisis without an economic one.''</p>
