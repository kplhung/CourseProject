        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Regarding Ben Ratliff's thought-provoking arguments regarding the overindulgent jazz soloist and the need for a ''jazz literature'' [''The Solo Retreats From the Spotlight in Jazz,'' May 28]: I found that Keith Jarrett's response to the article [Letter to the Editor, June 11] partly supported, rather than denied, Mr. Ratliff's point. Yes, as Mr. Jarrett pointed out, Duke Ellington's music sounds lifeless without master improvisers to bring it to life. But let's remember, also, that Ellington is one of the few jazz artists whose ratio of solo time to notation is almost equal. It is, of course, the solos that make the written music come alive, but the reverse is equally true. How many jazz artists today are producing notated material that is as lengthy, complex and perfectly ever-present as Duke? I believe that jazz is certainly in need of more Ben Websters, but perhaps in more dire need of composers like Ellington. No one is denying that jazz springs to life in the midst of a great solo. But can anyone deny that jazz needs to grow by expressing itself in new and perhaps more challenging ways compositionally? I believe a critical issue lies unaddressed, one that is fundamental to the ascendancy of jazz soloing: economics. All over America, and especially in New York, jazz musicians have been making about $50 a night for more than 30 years. And since Duke's time the performing opportunities (the real way the music grows) have considerably diminished. How can you ask a musician to rehearse complicated charts that may take him or her hours or days to master under these conditions? His response, whether tacit or out loud, will be to turn the composer down in favor of a situation where he can ''just blow.'' Mingus went through this 40 years ago; nothing's changed. If more of us had a Lincoln Center to commission us, trust me, there'd be a lot of ink flying around.</p>
