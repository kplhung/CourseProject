        <p>Kentucky is a battleground state this election year and Gov. Paul E. Patton, a Democrat, is worried. And irked.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas keeps showing up, raising money for himself and the Kentucky and national Republican parties and campaigning for himself and state and Congressional Republican candidates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush says he intends to carry Kentucky. He is intent on helping Kentucky Republicans win three hotly contested Congressional races.</p>
        <p>And he is trying to help Republicans maintain their 20-18 majority in the Kentucky State Senate, a crucial majority because going into next year's redistricting process, Mr. Patton will still be sitting in the governor's chair and Democrats almost certainly will still be in control of the State House of Representatives.</p>
        <p>So last weekend when Mr. Bush showed up in Kentucky for the third time in five weeks -- he raised some $1.7 million while talking up himself and other Republicans -- Governor Patton groused enough already and accused him of using ''strong-arm tactics'' to wring money and votes out of Kentuckians.</p>
        <p>''This is unprecedented for a presidential candidate to participate this way,'' the governor said. ''It just blows my mind.''</p>
        <p>The state Republican chairwoman, Ellen Williams, laughed and called Mr. Patton's remarks ''wacky sour grapes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was more pointed, sending the governor this message:</p>
        <p>''I'm coming. Get used to it. I'm going to come to your state as many times as I feel like coming -- and win the vote.''</p>
