        <p>AS senior vice president for merchandising at Tiffany &amp; Company, Linda Hanson had to be careful when talking about creating a new design for the Tiffany engagement ring.</p>
        <p>After all, the company had been making its trademark ring, with its famous ''Tiffany setting,'' for 114 years. But Ms. Hanson pressed for a new product, and Tiffany introduced Lucida, billed as ''the new Tiffany engagement ring,'' last fall. With a square-cut diamond and sleek setting, it is a far cry from the traditional Tiffany setting, with a round diamond. The new ring starts at $2,000.</p>

        <p>AS senior vice president for merchandising at Tiffany &amp; Company, Linda Hanson had to be careful when talking about creating a new design for the Tiffany engagement ring.</p>
        <p>After all, the company had been making its trademark ring, with its famous ''Tiffany setting,'' for 114 years. But Ms. Hanson pressed for a new product, and Tiffany introduced Lucida, billed as ''the new Tiffany engagement ring,'' last fall. With a square-cut diamond and sleek setting, it is a far cry from the traditional Tiffany setting, with a round diamond. The new ring starts at $2,000.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hanson, a math and economics major at Smith College, worked in the 1980's for Smith Barney, where she became a vice president in corporate finance. But she was always fascinated by gems and grew interested in design during her art history classes at Smith.</p>
        <p>After seven years at Smith Barney, she wanted a career change. She studied at the Gemological Institute of America and joined Tiffany</p>
        <p>in 1990, becoming a vice president in 1994.</p>
        <p>The new ring, several years in the making, is intended to attract a more adventurous buyer. ''We knew that we needed to create a new icon in the engagement world,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But making an icon isn't easy. Ms. Hanson directed a team of gemologists, designers and marketers that produced the ring. The gemologists worked on different ways to cut the stone while designers worked on creating the band. Then the team made sure that the cut matched the design of the setting.</p>
        <p>The group practiced on real diamonds. As for the scores of stones that just didn't work, Ms. Hanson said many were simply discarded. ''It sounds kind of weird, because you use actual diamonds, she said, but that's just a part of research and development.''</p>
