        <p>FOR years now, the Other War on Drugs has been fought from the thatch-roofed hospitals of rural Africa to the travertine-clad corridors of the United Nations' Palace of Nations here. It is a war over the sale of life-saving medicines to developing countries. At issue are not only prices but also implications for free trade and intellectual property rights.</p>
        <p>Advocates for the world's poor are mounting a powerful moral and political campaign to make advanced medicines available much more cheaply, even though it costs billions of dollars to research and develop them. But can pharmaceutical corporations greatly discount their products for the poor yet continue to finance research and show a profit? And do the poor have an absolute moral right to such medicines, even to the point of infringing patents and pirating drugs?</p>
        <p>Thanks to capitalism's victory in the cold war and pressure from the West for open markets, the world's pharmaceutical giants have largely had the upper hand in the struggle.</p>
        <p>That is no longer true.</p>
        <p>The balance has shifted with the forming of an awkward coalition of public health agencies, governments and drug makers in the third world, advocates for AIDS patients, consumer groups and demonstrators who disrupt world trade meetings. The battle line itself was redrawn last month when the White House changed its position on the way poor countries adopt the 1994 Treaty on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. Written to end piracy of consumer goods, the agreement has an obscure section permitting patented products to be copied in emergencies. The AIDS epidemic is such an emergency, said Michael R. Reich, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. Executives can no longer focus only on profits, he said.</p>
        <p>''Big pharma has recognized that it has to think more positively about access for poor countries,'' Professor Reich said.</p>
        <p>If such a ''health exception'' to the treaty were recognized, the door would be open to treat the forgotten epidemics of malaria, sleeping sickness and elephantiasis as emergencies. This may be possible because of the new forces that have entered the fray. The new director general of the World Health Organization, Gro Harlem Brundtland, has reinvigorated an agency previously known for its sluggishness. Doctors Without Borders, a group already critical of the drug industry, won the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize, effectively spinning a halo around its every utterance. Act Up, a protest organization, suddenly took up Africa's cause and began hounding Vice President Al Gore over his ties to the industry.</p>
        <p>Last month, the White House issued an executive order: it would not oppose African nations that violated American patent law to get AIDS drugs. Did that mean the government had actually switched sides in the debate over protecting the pharmaceutical giants?</p>
        <p>''Protecting intellectual property rights is fundamental to having a dynamic pharmaceutical industry,'' said Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services. ''But at the same time, we're recognizing the need to drag down the costs of drugs.'' Ms. Shalala called it a ''balancing act.''</p>
        <p>Two days later, five pharmaceutical giants agreed to discuss voluntary cuts in the prices of their AIDS drugs to Africa, even cuts of 80 percent. That would reduce profits but enable the companies to control their patents.</p>
        <p>A week later, a conference of world health ministers asked the W.H.O. for a database of prices for all AIDS drugs on sale, even in countries that ignore American and European patents, and for help in rewriting their own patent laws so they can buy them legally.</p>
        <p>When the 1994 treaty was written, said Jeffrey D. Sachs, a Harvard economist who studies development in the third world, the industry didn't have in mind ''a titanic struggle for the drug market in Tanzania -- Tanzania wasn't on the radar screen. They didn't even think about the implications for the poorest countries, and then they ran into this growing health disaster.''</p>
        <p>The five American, British and German companies offering to talk about price cuts are still vague about exact numbers. The one exception, Glaxo Wellcome, said it would cut its anti-retroviral cocktail Combivir from $16 a pill to $2. But it has not shipped the cheaper drug yet, and the company's representatives in Kenya recently declined to say whether Glaxo Wellcome wanted any quid pro quo from African countries -- such as dropping efforts to pass patent-seizure laws, as Kenya is considering. The drug companies have traditionally put intense pressure on countries contemplating such laws.</p>
        <p>A recently released AIDS study for the United Nations showed that Brazilian companies were ready to sell generic anti-retrovirals at very low prices. A Combivir equivalent was offered for $1.44, for example, and ddC for 24 cents a pill, rather than $8.80, its American price. The drug industry has long warned that copies may be substandard.</p>
        <p>If the poor actually dare to demand free drugs, can the hugely profitable industry really afford it? The answer seems to be: up to a point.</p>
        <p>PFIZER donates millions of doses of Zithromax to the International Trachoma Initiative, which treats a form of blindness common in central Africa. The powerful antibiotic sells for up to $60 a dose in the West, and earns the company $1 billion a year. Yet Pfizer moves cautiously in Africa and Asia to make sure that the drug is not smuggled back to Europe or America, undermining sales. Merck donates Ivermectin for river blindness; Bayer gives Praziquantel for schistosomiasis, which is caused by liver flukes. But the quantities are never sufficient, and administrative costs are high.</p>
        <p>If Western industry can't find a solution, it will find the world turning to what the industry sees as its nemesis, India. There, 26,000 companies replicate everything from antibiotics to AIDS cocktails to Rogaine and Viagra -- all legally, since Indian law recognizes patents on processes, not products.</p>
        <p>''We don't need to be apologetic about it,'' India's secretary of health, Javid A. Chowdhury, said in an interview. ''We are a self-contained developing economy -- we live on little, but we survive. The per-capita health budget in India is $10 a year.''</p>
        <p>But even this generic copying must end. India recently signed the 1994 treaty on intellectual property rights and must enforce it by 2005.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 9, 2000, Sunday  An article in the Week in Review on June 25 about the right of the poor to inexpensive medicine incorrectly described the disease schistosomiasis. It is caused by a blood trematode, not by a liver fluke.</p>
