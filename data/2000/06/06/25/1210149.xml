        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read ''The Enforcer'' (News and Topics, June 18) with interest. Fred Chichester and the Montclair Parking Committee have long been trying to help deal with an extremely serious matter. The Montclair public schools are mostly in residential areas; they all began as neighborhood schools to which children mainly walked. With desegregation in the 60's, and the formation of magnet themes to attract students, children began to take buses or be driven by their parents -- not a problem if they are dropped off, but serious when  cars are parked and left standing illegally for any amount of time.</p>

        <p>We live near an elementary school where parents routinely park on both  sides of a narrow street. This poses a danger to children and residents. Citizens should park legally when driving their children to school, even if that means walking farther. Mr.  Chichester is looking out for our children, and should be commended for  his efforts.</p>
