        <p>The Travel section receives hundreds of letters from readers about their experiences with airline travel. Although most write to complain, a small number actually offer words of praise. Here is a selection from the last year:</p>
        <p>To the Editor: If an airline cherishes one class of passengers at the expense of another, does it pay? Evidently Air France thinks so.</p>
        <p>Upon landing in New York on a flight from Paris, the cabin crew blocked tourist-class aisles, prohibiting debarkation until we could see no more first- or business-class people. Finally, the ''steerage'' folks remonstrated loudly, shouting ''Enough!'' and ''Let us off!'' It was only then that we were allowed off.</p>
        <p>JEROME PRIEST  North Grosvenordale, Conn.</p>
        <p>Diane Cornman, an Air France spokeswoman, replies: Many major carriers allow first-class and business-class passengers to deplane first. There is a valid reason for this, in that the door for disembarking, in most circumstances, is the forward left door. They deplane first to allow for a smoother and more efficient disembarkation. It is also important to note that ''premium'' passengers on essentially every airline are offered special services, including allowing them to disembark quickly.</p>
