        <p>A Little Too Close to God</p>
        <p>The Thrills and Panic of a Life in Israel.</p>
        <p>By David Horovitz.</p>
        <p>311 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A Knopf. $26.</p>
        <p>When I first picked up David Horovitz's ''A Little Too Close to God,'' my first thought was, ''Dayenu'' (loose translation for those reading the English-only Haggadah: ''Enough already''). It is a well-known fact that the People of the Book are in reality the People of the Book Proposal, and so the world has been overly blessed by books that make the following two observations: (1) Israel is filled with Jews! And (2) They're all nuts!</p>
        <p>But despite the title, Horovitz gives us an entertaining (if occasionally exasperating and disorganized) memoir of his life as an English immigrant in Israel. What makes ''A Little Too Close to God'' particularly interesting, however, is the jeremiad embedded in the narrative. It seems as if Horovitz, the editor of The Jerusalem Report, an English-language magazine, had set out to write his autobiography, but politics -- and his fear for the future of Israel -- intervened. ''A Little Too Close to God'' is a screaming denunciation of everything loathed by the Israeli left: the intolerance of the Orthodox, Israel's gratuitously cruel treatment of the Palestinians and, most loathed of all, the politics and character of the former (and possibly future) Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In fact, Horovitz's love for Yitzhak Rabin, a man he idealizes, and his hatred for Netanyahu -- and hatred is not an overstatement -- are the emotions that seem to power him out of bed each morning.</p>
        <p>''A Little Too Close to God'' is an important book, if only because Horovitz gives the lie to the stereotype of Western immigrants to Israel (''Anglo-Saxons,'' in the ridiculous taxonomy of Israeli immigration) as savages who beat the hell out of Palestinian farmers because the Italians of Bensonhurst used to beat the hell out of them.</p>
        <p>There is truth to the stereotype -- we have the evil Dr. Baruch Goldstein and his massacre of 29 Arabs to thank for that -- but there is truth in its opposite: Western immigrants are disproportionately present in the thin ranks of Israelis who are pressing for the rights of the individual -- Arab and Jewish -- and who are promoting, at great personal risk, alternatives to the fossilized Orthodoxy of the Israeli religious establishment.</p>
        <p>Horovitz is firmly in the humanist camp. He is a member of one of Jerusalem's few progressive synagogues -- a house of worship regularly threatened by Jewish extremists -- and, like most Israeli journalists, he is very much a creature of the left (in Israel, unlike America, there is an actual left-wing Jewish media conspiracy).</p>
        <p>Horovitz's denunciation of Netanyahu forms the hot center of this book, and it is something to behold, a striking reminder that in Israel, politics is life and death and everything in between. ''Perhaps it doesn't much matter, in the existential scheme of things, whether America chooses a Bush or a Clinton, a Gore or a Bush, but it sure matters here,'' Horovitz writes. ''One man, yes, one man, in hardly any time at all, turned back the course of Israeli history -- shut down the bridge-building with the Palestinians, froze the warming relations with the moderate Arab world, left Jordan and Egypt embarrassed about having made peace with us.''</p>
        <p>He continues, unnecessarily: ''I feel this extraordinary bitterness toward Netanyahu. Bitterness because, if I have come to mythologize Rabin as the embodiment of my Israel dream, then Netanyahu, demagogic, divisive, destructive, has come to symbolize the nightmare.''</p>
        <p>I carry no brief for Netanyahu, but Horovitz's vehemence is disturbing. It is precisely this sort of hyperemotionalism that has led to the coarsening of Israeli life, which was never terribly Japanese to begin with. Horovitz's vehemence is troublesome, too, because the magazine he edits is the best periodical published in Israel, in English or Hebrew. The Jerusalem Report is a beacon of professionalism and sobriety in a press culture that sometimes resembles the National Hockey League, and its editor should be careful not to let his spleen get the better of him.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, it's not as if he's wrong.</p>
        <p>Horovitz's vitriol, however exasperating, effectively highlights the central fact of Israeli life: that everything is political. He is at his most amusing, in fact, when he uses his own experience to underscore the absurd omnipresence of politics in the culture. He writes, for instance, that he and his wife, Lisa (originally from Texas), ''even make driving decisions on the basis of political bumper stickers. If the car that wants to change into our lane or pull out ahead of us into the traffic features a 'Friend, We Miss You' sticker, in memory of Yitzhak Rabin, or one pronouncing 'A Strong Nation Makes Peace,' whichever one of us is driving is likely to yield. But if, as is more common in right-wing Jerusalem, the back windshield is adorned with something like 'Hebron, From Days of Old and Forever,' we'll try to freeze out the offending vehicle.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes Horovitz seems nave. He implies throughout the book that the Palestinians seek peace more ardently than the Israelis, and he is scornful of Israeli skepticism. ''I just do not believe that Arafat's chief of affairs in Jerusalem, Faisal Husseini, whom I have interviewed half a dozen times, nurses a secret plan to eliminate the state of Israel.'' I have also interviewed Husseini -- who is charming and affable and a proud Palestinian nationalist -- and I would be wary of guessing what he, or any other Palestinian, dreams about at night.</p>
        <p>Horovitz has written what he knows will be a controversial book. Even at this late, post-Zionist stage of the game, many readers will recoil at his unapologetic criticism of Israeli society. ''There are still so many well-intentioned supporters of Israel to whom the very notion of a Jew writing something uncomplimentary about the Jewish state smacks of treachery,'' he writes.</p>
        <p>Yet unlike some of Israel's more strident supporters in the United States, he is willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for his country. Not his own life, but the lives of his young children, who will soon enough receive draft notices calling them up for army service. Perhaps Horovitz should direct some of his bile away from Israelis and toward the more recalcitrant of his country's remaining Arab enemies, but this is the book of an Israeli patriot nonetheless, one who believes his adopted country can be better than it is today, and one who does not believe that hate has to last forever.</p>
