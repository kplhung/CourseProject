        <p>The struggle over prescription drug benefits for the elderly, now center stage in the House, is not simply between Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives. It has also driven a wedge between two of the biggest, most influential lobbies in Washington: the Health Insurance Association of America and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.</p>
        <p>For months now, the pharmaceutical industry has been arguing -- on Capitol Hill and beyond, in an intensive advertising campaign -- that any new prescription drug benefit for the elderly must be provided through the private sector, not the traditional Medicare program.</p>
        <p>Critics say the industry fears that direct government involvement will inevitably mean government pressure on drug industry prices -- and profits. The pharmaceutical association asserts, as it said in one recent advertisement, that ''a government-run prescription drug plan'' and ''government controls'' on prices would hurt the industry, slow research and ultimately harm patients.</p>
        <p>That philosophy, which fits neatly with the Republican desire for less government and more private market forces in the Medicare program, is at the heart of the prescription drug bill that the Ways and Means Committee passed Wednesday night, which may hit the House floor next week. The Republican bill would use government subsidies to encourage private companies to offer drug policies to the elderly. Medicare does not cover outpatient prescription drugs, and about a third of the elderly have no drug coverage at all.</p>
        <p>But there has been a persistent voice of resistance from the insurance industry, ordinarily a strong ally of the Republican Party. Officials of the Health Insurance Association of America have been warning that the private-sector solution being debated would be difficult to achieve. Even with federal subsidies, insurance officials have warned, private companies would have a hard time offering an affordable product and making a profit in a market where drug prices keep rising and the sickest elderly people -- the heaviest users of prescription drugs -- are most likely to buy the coverage.</p>
        <p>As Charles N. Kahn III, president of the group, testified before a House committee earlier this month, ''We do not believe that private drug-only insurance is a viable concept given the substantial economic and regulatory barriers and problems with adverse selection that would face such a product.''</p>
        <p>This tension between two industry giants, like the fierce partisan warfare, is one more hurdle in the way of passing prescription drug legislation this year. The debate has bubbled throughout the spring, much to the annoyance of Republican leaders who have been scrambling to find a consensus on prescription drug coverage, considered one of the most powerful issues of this election year.</p>
        <p>''We've been trying to find something that gets through the House,'' said John P. Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert. ''Obviously, some aspects of the insurance industry aren't that excited about it, but we're trying to get something that will help seniors.''</p>
        <p>Neither industry group has officially taken a position on the Republican bill, but their disagreement is widely known and infuses the larger, more partisan debate. Democrats and their allies say the insurance industry's resistance proves that the Republican bill is not a realistic effort to meet the needs of the elderly.</p>
        <p>''This really shows the G.O.P. drug plan to be a mirage,'' said Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a health care advocacy group. ''It looks good from a distance, but there's very little there. Notwithstanding the fact that the G.O.P. bill would provide huge subsidies to insurance companies, the insurance companies are still saying, 'We're not going to offer these policies.' ''</p>
        <p>President Clinton, who has a drug proposal of his own and is a sharp critic of the House Republicans' plan, has noted the insurance industry's criticism on several occasions. Mr. Clinton has spent much of his administration at odds with the health insurers association, most notably when the group ran the legendary ''Harry and Louise'' advertisements attacking his proposal for national health insurance.</p>
        <p>Chris Jennings, the deputy assistant to the president for health policy, said, ''When the advocates of Harry and Louise and the president agree on something, people say there must be something to this.''</p>
        <p>The larger Democratic critique of the Republican plan, as voiced by many people this week, is that the obvious solution to the lack of a drug benefit in Medicare is to add a drug benefit to Medicare -- rather than, as Mr. Pollack puts it, ''contorting yourself'' to find private-sector mechanisms that the private sector itself has doubts about. As Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, put it, ''Republicans want to basically privatize this benefit, as they've always wanted to privatize Medicare.''</p>
        <p>Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, argued that the last major effort to open Medicare to more private insurance involvement, Medicare+Choice, ''by anyone's analysis has not worked.'' He was referring to the fact that many Medicare beneficiaries in recent years have signed with private health maintenance organizations, rather than the traditional Medicare program, only to see their H.M.O.'s pull out of the Medicare market because they found it unprofitable.</p>
        <p>Republicans counter that their plan would give the nation's elderly more choices in drug plans; they note that it guarantees every Medicare beneficiary a choice of at least two plans, and would also provide for a federal fallback plan if private insurers do not offer coverage in a particular area.</p>
        <p>And while the Health Insurance Association of America -- whose members include the biggest health insurers and provide benefits to 123 million Americans over all -- may be resisting this new market, Republican leaders note that others are not. Representative Bill Thomas of California, the chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health and the prime mover on this bill, noted this week that a leading drug benefit manager, Merck-Medco Managed Care, had said it would ''work to develop a prescription-drug-only plan that we could offer nationwide in competition with others in what we expect will be a highly competitive market.''</p>
        <p>''The fact of the matter is, if you build it, they will come,'' said Mr. Feehery, the House speaker's aide. The legislation, he added, ''will create a huge pot of money that the private market will want to get involved in. The fact is, this is a great benefit for seniors and we've already had some movement from the private sector that they will be interested in it.''</p>
        <p>Judith H. Bello, executive vice president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in her testimony on June 13 that she was certain the private marketplace could produce drug benefits for the elderly, since it had already produced private insurance policies for ''cancer, sports accidents, emergency room visits, pregnancy complications and campers.''</p>
        <p>After the Republican bill passed the Ways and Means Committee Wednesday, on a strict party-line vote, Mr. Kahn said he had no comment ''on the bill right now.'' Asked if he would lobby against the bill when it hits the floor next week, he again declined to comment. But the dispute clearly puts him in an awkward position, politically and, perhaps, personally. Before assuming the presidency of the health insurance association, Mr. Kahn was staff director for the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health.</p>
        <p>As for the pharmaceutical association, its critics assert that it is so panic-stricken over the prospect of the government cutting into its profits that industry lobbying will only intensify. Even if, as many expect, nothing is enacted this year to provide prescription drug coverage to the elderly, the issue will only return in the new administration and Congress of 2001.</p>
        <p>''There's so much money being thrown around on this issue that it's really hard to track,'' said Holly Bailey, a researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics.</p>
