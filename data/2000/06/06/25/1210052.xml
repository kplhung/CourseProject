        <p>LAST Monday a 70-year-old woman sat surrounded by 14 relatives, including her husband, brother, sister, three of her children, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.</p>
        <p>One by one, they approached and spoke to her, telling her they loved her, planning shopping dates and reminiscing. And for the first time, she heard them.</p>
        <p>Before that, the last sounds Hermine Wilber heard were bombs being dropped on Vienna in 1945, just before she went deaf as a result of spinal meningitis at 15.</p>
        <p>In May Mrs. Wilber had an electronic stimulator called a cochlear implant surgically installed in her right ear at Westchester Medical Center here.</p>
        <p>And on Monday morning she had it activated at the hospital's Speech and Hearing Center. An audiologist, Sara C. Morton, programmed Mrs. Wilber's speech processor and asked her: ''Are you ready?''</p>
        <p>''Am I ready?'' replied Mrs. Wilber, who reads lips. ''55 years.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Morton held a piece of paper in front of her mouth and made the noises, ''Bop, bop, bop,'' and quick as a reflex, Mrs. Wilber echoed back: ''Bop bop, bop.''</p>
        <p>The room burst into gasps, then tears, then group hugs, almost to the point of neglecting the smiling success story.</p>
        <p>''Come on,'' Mrs. Wilber said. ''Talk to me.''</p>
        <p>Carl Wandell, her son-in-law, laughed and said, ''That's one we've never heard from her before.''</p>
        <p>Her oldest daughter, also named Hermine, 53, put her hand over her mother's eyes and said words Mrs. Wilber had never heard before: ''I love you, Mom.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Wilber's son, Stuart, 45, reminded his mother of the Donald Duck stories she had read to him as a child and their hikes together in the mountains. Mrs. Wilber held Stuart's daughter, Amanda, and told her they could now speak by phone from Amanda's New Mexico home. She told her great-grandson, Ben, 5, ''We will play hide and seek, and you will yell for me to find you.''</p>
        <p>Then it was time to hear her husband, Bill Wilber, for the first time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilber, 78, kept his distance, as if it was that evening he first met her in Vienna, a year after she had gone deaf. He approached her gingerly, not knowing quite what to say. But finally he said softly, ''I met you in 1946.''</p>
        <p>She nodded, and he asked her if his voice was the way she imagined. She said it was low and strong. The family stood by, silent and filled with emotion.</p>
        <p>So he cracked a joke.</p>
        <p>''Do I sound knowledgeable?'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Wilber's hearing was returning slowly. She said she could hear the air-conditioner. She could not, however, hear the sobs from her family in the rear of the room. She called for her grandson Thomas, a teenager with a linebacker's build and a baby face, but he collapsed in his mother's arms, crying too hard to speak.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Wilber, who lives in Stone Ridge, N.Y., near Kingston, said she never imagined she would hear again, but then last year she began having a recurring dream involving her younger brother Kurt. Kurt's wife was a nurse, and often, before his death in 1998, he urged Mrs. Wilber to inquire about a new procedure that restored hearing.</p>
        <p>''In the dream, he told me I would hear again,'' said Mrs. Wilber, who related the dream to her daughter, Rosemarie Wandell. Rose told her mother she had recently seen a news segment about cochlear implant surgery. They called Westchester Medical Center and applied for the procedure, one offered to patients who have suffered damage to the inner ear, or cochlea, but not to the auditory nerve.</p>
        <p>The implant basically replaces the function of the cochlea, by electrically stimulating the auditory nerve.</p>
        <p>Last month, in a three-hour operation, Dr. Lawrence V. Meiteles drilled a hole in Mrs. Wilber's skull, behind her ear. He inserted a wire electrode near the auditory nerve. The wire was then attached to an electrode implanted into her skull under the skin. By being connected to an external device that filters and converts external sound, the implant allows her to hear.</p>
        <p>The procedure can restore some hearing to most deaf people, but it is most effective for people who have lost their hearing after learning to speak, because their brain has already adapted to sound and speech.</p>
        <p>Aside from her decades of silence, Mrs. Wilber was unusual because she grew up in Vienna and never learned much English.</p>
        <p>As a child she attended the Vienna School of Art, studying dancing, singing and acting. She always told her mother she would be a ''big star,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But her father, a glass blower, had spoken against the Nazis, who were occupying Vienna. The children were expelled from school, and the family went into hiding.</p>
        <p>In October 1944, while working at a photo studio one evening, Mrs. Wilber fell ill and headed home. She could not be taken to a proper hospital for fear of the Nazis, so she was taken to a nearby shelter, where she fell into a coma. Eventually, a doctor diagnosed spinal meningitis. She recovered from the coma after two weeks but lost her hearing.</p>
        <p>''Her whole future was destroyed by it,'' said her sister, Charlotte Wienckowski, 73, who lives in Brockport, N.Y. ''She always said she wanted to be a movie star, someone special.''</p>
        <p>Then, in 1946 she met Mr. Wilber, an American soldier, outside an Army nightclub in Vienna, and she began dating him. For months, Mr. Wilber did not know she was deaf because she read lips so well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilber liked the spry girl with the red hair and the animated personality, and her disability made no difference to him.</p>
        <p>She agreed to move back to America with him, and in 1947, they married and began raising a family on the Wilber farm in Stone Ridge at the base of the Catskills.</p>
        <p>Undoubtedly her deafnesss posed challenges. As a supervisor of security at I.B.M., Mr. Wilber often worked nights, and Mrs. Wilber kept her children in bed with her because she could not hear them cry.</p>
        <p>He taught her English, and they communicated by their own version of sign language, spelling out parts of words. She took up painting and writing poems, several of which have been published in anthologies.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Wilber also began cultivating a rather unusual passion: belly dancing. After her children became teenagers, she enrolled in an adult education class, and then began traveling to Manhattan to study. She sewed her own costumes, intricately tailored in extraordinary detail.</p>
        <p>She danced by sensing vibrations, counting beats and following visual cues. ''The music was still in my heart,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She taught students privately, and billing herself as ''Hermeenah,'' she performed at parades, street fairs and charity events,  hoping, she said, to encourage other people with disabilities to develop their talents.</p>
        <p>But her deafness made her sad. On her daily nature walks, she admired the mountains but could never hear the birds and waterfalls. And she missed music, like Strauss and Bach. And she wanted to hear what Elvis sounded like. She wanted to hear her children and her husband laughing.</p>
        <p>And as it happens, Mrs. Wilber could have had the procedure 10 years ago, when it first started to be offered to the general public, said Dr. Meiteles, who specializes in skull-based surgery. The three-hour operation, which usually costs around $40,000, is now covered by most insurance plans.</p>
        <p>''She was never aware it was available,'' he said. ''She hadn't been to an ear doctor in 30 years.'' He said he has performed the surgery successfully on older patients than Mrs. Wilber, ''but she's definitely the first 70-year-old belly dancer.''</p>
        <p>Last week at the center, Mrs. Wilber's family gathered around her and sang a family prayer, and she joined them.</p>
        <p>Then they asked her to sing her favorite song, a German tune. She recorded the song, ''Vogel Geflogen,'' on a 78-r.p.m. record at 14. Her family kept the record and played it for her last week.</p>
        <p>But as she slowly shrugged off her shroud of silence, Mrs. Wilber seemed more rapt by ordinary sounds than by music. She woke up Tuesday morning baffled by a noise outside the window, the lawn mower. Then she heard a series of strange clacking sounds, her heels on the wood floor.</p>
        <p>She knew finally that she had left her 55-year sentence of silence behind when a granddaughter's pager made her jump, as if to welcome her back to the world of sound.</p>
