        <p>ERIC McCORMACK'S wife didn't stand a chance Wednesday night at the Amfar benefit at Ellis Island. Though she looked pretty in her polka dot dress and a peony corsage, Janet McCormack was outnumbered competing for her husband's attention. It was, after all, an AIDS benefit, and Mr. McCormack, the evening's M.C., had to keep 700 mostly gay men feeling generous during a four-hour program.</p>
        <p>A straight Canadian-born actor may seem an unlikely draw for an AIDS fund-raiser, whose headliners are typically gay icons like Liza Minnelli and Elton John. But Mr. McCormack is the star of NBC's ''Will &amp; Grace,'' the sitcom in which he plays a gay Manhattan lawyer whose best friend is a straight woman.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, he was having a hard time stepping out of character. Primped up in a black suit by Banana Republic, paired with a parrot green shirt and matching silk tie, the handsome and affable Mr. McCormack camped it up, showing off vintage postcards of Elizabeth Taylor he had bought while window shopping earlier that day. ''Fabulous,'' one man said. ''He's perfect boyfriend material,'' another whispered.</p>
        <p>''I was called a fag since I was 2,'' Mr. McCormack said, explaining that growing up he was shy and didn't play sports. ''When I started this show, my biggest fear was that the community wouldn't accept me.''</p>
        <p>By 7:15, the crowd was lining up for cocktails in the baggage room of the registry building as Mr. McCormack greeted Mario M. Cuomo and others near the paparazzi pen. ''I had to miss an event for Harry Belafonte,'' said the former governor, who was there to deliver a keynote speech on AIDS activism.</p>
        <p>At 8, a medley of salmon, chicken and filet mignon was served upstairs under a vaulted ceiling decorated with the AIDS Memorial Quilt. ''I keep seeing guards walking around,'' said Larry Kramer, the playwright and founder of Act Up, pointing to the prisonlike catwalk that circles the room. He was among the nine who were honored by Amfar that night.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCormack took the stage to deliver introductory remarks. ''As a straight man playing a gay role,'' he began, but the audio system could not compete with the din of forks.</p>
        <p>''I think he's great,'' said James Dale, the telegenic Boy Scout whose gay rights case is expected to be decided before the Supreme Court any day, ''but we also need openly gay people on television.''</p>
        <p>By dessert, a flock of admirers were surrounding Mr. McCormack. ''I'm a better leading actor as a gay man than I've ever been in a straight role,'' he said. ''I'm just being me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCormack's limelight suffered a temporary blackout with the arrival of the supernova of the AIDS charity circuit: Elizabeth Taylor. Dr. Mathilde Krim, Amfar's chairwoman, took over host duties to introduce ''the only person in the world who doesn't need an introduction.'' A gasp could be heard as Ms. Taylor, escorted by a phalanx of security guards, swept onto the stage, wearing a pink organza gown. You could have heard an AIDS ribbon pin drop as she spoke for six minutes about ''strength, courage and fortitude,'' before she was whisked away. ''It was like the coming of the president of the United States,'' said Matt Coles, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union's AIDS Project.</p>
        <p>Nearly half a million dollars had been netted in ticket sales that evening, in addition to $60,000 that Mr. McCormack raised by auctioning walk-on parts for his show. ''You really do get to kiss me,'' he said after announcing a winning bid.</p>
        <p>As the event wound down at 11, Mr. McCormack got a final laugh when he bid adieu to the partygoers and said, ''There's a couple of big fairies waiting for you outside.''</p>
