        <p>FOR several months, I've been dating a girl who lives in Baton Rouge, La. And not only is she the first Southern girl I've dated, but she does something I've never seen before. Whenever we're in her car, she reaches for the radio, hits a button for one of the country stations on preset and starts singing along. Now, I've lived in a lot of cities -- Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Nashville, Seattle -- and met a lot of people. But this is the first time I've spent time with anybody who sings along with country-music radio. Even in Nashville, where the people who manufacture the music live, rock 'n' roll, rap or alternative country reigns in cars. Country radio listening, in general, is strictly business.</p>
        <p>Of course, like many of my friends, I love country music. We listen to Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Hank Williams, George Jones, Johnny Cash, Loretta Lynn and all the great lesser-known Texans like Townes Van Zandt and Jimmie Dale Gilmore. But we're city folk and musical intelligentsia. This is music we like, not music we live or grow up to. And it's definitely not the country my Baton Rouge girl listens to. Sure, she likes most of the above -- she was even named after a Waylon Jennings song. But that's her parents' music. Country to her is Jo Dee Messina, Tracy Lawrence, Faith Hill (but not pop songs like ''This Kiss''), Diamond Rio, Steve Wariner, and that one song by Shedaisy about a girl breaking up with her boyfriend and taking the cat but leaving the litter. When she's in the mood for more classic country, she listens to the Judds, George Strait, Pam Tillis, early Reba McIntyre and that Nitty Gritty Dirt Band song about fishing in the dark.</p>

        <p>Hanging out with her, I've come to realize that, although at the very least 60 million records are sold each year by such contemporary country acts, not one person I know in any position of cultural authority whatsoever can truly say they like the genre. So what's the problem? The genre or us?</p>
        <p>Let's start by taking a look at us. To simplify things, we like music that we can relate to. This may be music that triggers a connection with our past -- reminding us of, say, the Beatles songs that we grew up with. It may simply be music that we've been socialized to like by friends and colleagues. Or it may be music that offers an escapist fantasy -- from the thug posturing of gangsta rap to the hard drinking, hard living and heartbreaking of classic country. But there is no cultural reinforcement in Northern cities for listening to contemporary country pop. Our friends don't listen to it, we didn't grow up on it and there isn't a radio station in Manhattan that plays it. Overall, it seems like canned, manufactured cliche. We may be able to enjoy Britney Spears singing ''I'm not that innocent'' as a guilty pop pleasure, but when it comes to Shedaisy and its cat litter we shut our ears.</p>
        <p>MY epiphany came when my girlfriend bought me a Steve Wariner CD. ''Listen to 'Small-Town Girl,' '' she insisted. It was probably one of the cheesiest songs anyone's ever asked me to listen to. The singing was over-sentimental and the music, full of synthesizer stabs, was trite. But then there were the lyrics, about a man who married a country girl and brought her back to a skyscraper apartment in the city, where she has hot coffee waiting and country radio playing every night after he comes home from a hard day at work. ''There ain't nothing like the love of a small-town girl,'' ran the chorus. They were the most hackneyed lyrics in the world, but I loved them. Because I understood that the song was her, singing to me.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, I was able to connect the song with my life and the things I cared about, and it opened up a door to the music. Though country has a large audience in the north, it's important because it remains a regional music, affirming the identity of those who live in a country within a country: the South, home to a race of very proud people often made to feel like second-class citizens culturally. It is a very different place from the North. In the South, they walk around every day with the identity of Southerner. In the North, we're simply Americans; we don't realize we're Northerners until we're in the South.</p>
        <p>Today, as evidence of a changing South, most pop country is about middle-class small-town life, or town-and-country, as Pat Quigley, the president of Capitol Records, likes to call it. When the music comes across as more backwater and rural, it is usually with the intention of further distinguishing itself from the entertainment of the city. For example, Tim McGraw sings: ''You can have a lot of fun in a New York minute/ But there are some things you can't do within those city limits/ There ain't no closing time, ain't no cover charge/ Just country boys and girls getting down on the farm.''</p>
        <p>The list of criticisms we often apply to contemporary country is as much a cliche as the music is accused of being. Detractors say it's slick, soulless and manufactured. There is no twang, no weepy steel guitar, no connection to legends like Hank Williams. But whose standards are we judging it by? We don't expect rockers to keep playing ''Rock Around the Clock'' and ''Blue Suede Shoes.''</p>
        <p>I certainly don't want to defend the music, but I do want to make the point that many people don't understand it. We want our hicks to remain hicks. But the hick musical savant is largely a myth: many of the aw-shucks performers on the Grand Ole Opry show 60 or 70 years ago were well-educated entertainers playing a vaudevillian part. Today, country has evolved into an industry that in many ways is much more sophisticated than rock, rap, even most pop. It exists in a small, centralized and very complex world. When record labels restructure and consolidate, there is massive bloodshed at the rock and pop labels while the country divisions are generally left alone. And the simple reason is that most New York and Los Angeles executives don't understand that world. It doesn't work the same way. It's not based on talent scouts signing artists to labels. There are other components that, while they exist in the pop world, are the lifeblood of country: songwriters, publishers and studio musicians.</p>
        <p>Great country hits are generally not written by a singer; they are shopped for and bought in the closest parallel modern music has to Tin Pan Alley. Listen to country radio and pay close attention to the lyrics. They are meticulously written and thought out. Vagueness will not do here: only clearly stated sentiments calculated to appeal to the broadest swath of the American public. (The most blatant example: the Chely Wright chorus ''I'm a single white female looking for a man like you.'')</p>
        <p>I suppose in the Big City we think we're too smart to fall for this. We have a snobbish attitude toward pop country, which in many ways is the same attitude we have toward the South. When I moved to Nashville for a short time, most of my New York friends turned up their noses on hearing the news and laughed: ''What are you going to do there?'' And the answer: ''Well, think of it as spending a year abroad.''</p>
        <p>Traveling around Tennessee, I entered a world with its own regional cuisine (meat-and-three restaurants and sweet tea) and its own music. And I came back with the realization that we can never really appreciate country in the same way country folks do. At best, we can appreciate it the way we listen to the Buena Vista Social Club: admire it from a distance, enjoying its intrinsic value but oblivious to its context and relationship with quotidian life.</p>
        <p>If you disagree, go buy an album by the best-selling group Montgomery Gentry. It's called ''Tattoos and Scars,'' and has been on the country charts for over 60 weeks. On the cover you'll see two hairy, beefy, mullet-topped good ole Kentucky boys who like to wear leather overcoats with black cowboy hats. Inside, you'll hear some strange attempt to package slick Nashville pop with bad-boy Southern rock. And you'll listen to it once, then set it aside, shaking your head and saying, ''This is not for me.'' And that's not musical elitism: I don't like it either. It wasn't made for you or me. It was made for people who don't like us.</p>
