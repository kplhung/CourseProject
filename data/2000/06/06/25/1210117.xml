        <p>JOHN GARNER, a slender, quiet-spoken man, is a 39-year-old artist whose subjects have included an Edward Hopper-like view of a pizzeria at night, the pastel swirl of advancing Buffalo Soldiers, and a luminous portrait of the Queen of Sheba.</p>
        <p>''Mostly I have gravitated to the impressionist style of painting,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His friend and fellow artist, who would identify himself only as Mr. Hills, prefers Michelangelo and Picasso.</p>
        <p>''Some of your Renaissance artists had a superb use of color,'' Mr. Hills said, ''and what I like about Picasso is his simplicity. I kind of combinated that in my paintings.''</p>
        <p>Both men are inmates at the Adult Diagnostic Treatment Center in Avenel, a state prison for repetitive, compulsive sex offenders. Mr. Hills, 45, a tall man with braided hair who has been in the prison system since 1983 for several crimes including a sex offense, was transferred to Avenel in 1993.</p>
        <p>He pointed to a copy of a Picasso he made in art class. ''I long to put that up in my house when I get out,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The waiting list to take art classes at the prison is several years long. Inmates study drawing, painting, the elements of design, ceramics and art history. They watch Sister Wendy tapes and Channel 13 and anything on television that deals with art.</p>
        <p>''Van Gogh is very important to them,'' said their art teacher, Barbara Lugutko. ''They could tell you stories about Caravaggio, that he is a master of chiaroscuro, that he was also institutionalized and that the only way he could make it through was by painting. This is very touching for them.''</p>
        <p>About 700 men live at the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center, which is half prison, half treatment center. Jesse K. Timmendequas, the man who was convicted of the 1994 sexual assault and killing 7-year-old Megan Kanka, spent six years at the center. That case is what inspired the legislation known as Megan's Law, which requires community notification when convicted sex offenders are released.</p>
        <p>Against this backdrop of controversy, state correction officials continue, as they are mandated to do under the New Jersey Criminal Code, to provide treatment to this group of sex offenders, and they believe that art is an important adjunct to the psychological and group counseling that inmates receive.</p>
        <p>''If you can draw on people's latent talents, they will realize they have some worth,'' said Grace Rogers, acting administrator of the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center. Many of the inmates say that art is helping them to become more human.</p>
        <p>''I'm a work in progress, and that is why art is so important. It becomes you,'' said Gregory Neely, a 40-year-old inmate. ''Our first responsibility is rehabilitation. Being a sex offender is not my totality. I need to replace this thing.</p>
        <p>''Ceramics is where I blossomed first, and you see other talented people there, too.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hills also does ceramics. An expert in different glazes, he holds a certificate in kiln operations, which he earned at Avenel. His creations include a sleek golden figure called ''Tribute to Motherhood'' and several Egyptian-style busts glazed in lustrous blue and gold. He is also Ms. Legutko's ''para pro,'' helping out with the glazes, loading and unloading the kiln and stretching canvases. ''The world of art let me see the world in color -- because before I saw the world in black and white alone,'' he said. ''With the therapy, it enabled me to have balance''</p>
        <p>Brian Marsh, supervisor of educational programs at the center, said: ''We see changes in individuals who have been hard to reach. Through the patience and the coming to terms with themselves that is involved in art, you see change, a softening of attitudes, pride developing and an increasing ability to tolerate others. It's really, I think, a wonderful program for us.''</p>
        <p>But will it stop people from committing sex offenses? Treatment programs generally have about a 20 percent recidivism rate, according to William Plantier, director of operations for the Department of Corrections. Mr. Plantier used to be the administrator at the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center. There are no clear-cut statistics when it comes to art classes, he said, ''but anytime you increase self-esteem with a trade or art, in a general sense, you have reduced the likelihood of recidivism.''</p>
        <p>To those who favor punishment over art classes, Mr. Plantier points out that 98 percent of the prisoners are going to be released. ''The mere fact that people are incarcerated is the sanction. The more you treat people like animals, the more you're going to get animalistic behavior when they do return to the society. I want them involved. We think we're doing what we should be doing. I don't feel I should be apologetic in saying that our mission is to prevent recidivism, and I don't think you do that by turning them into animals.''</p>
        <p>This September some of the inmates' artwork will be exhibited at a gallery in Richmond, Va. The inmates will not be receiving compensation, but the recognition and sense of communicating with the outside world will mean everything. ''It means an awful lot to be able to express yourself and feel a sense of acceptance, said Abdul Khaliqu Shabazz, who was sentenced to 30 years. His mauve, repetitive-image portrait of Malcolm X was much influenced, he said, by the style of Andy Warhol.</p>
        <p>The idea for the exhibition came from Jimmy Sadowski, a 52-year-old man who had been in and out of prisons in Virginia for 30 years. After his release in 1994, Mr. Sadowski went back to college. Now he is getting a master's degree in fine arts at Long Island University and has applied for a Guggenheim fellowship to Scotland.</p>
        <p>''Art really changed my life around,'' Mr. Sadowski said. ''It gave me something to focus on. It reconstructed my whole way of thinking. It's a key to rehabilitation.''</p>
