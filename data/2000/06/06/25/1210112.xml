        <p>Taxpayers of New Jersey, look to your wallets. Next year's governor's race is already under way, and the two most powerful men in Trenton are competing for your vote with projects that could end up adding heavily to the state's debt -- debt that will have to be paid back with interest.</p>
        <p>The focus of concern about debt is in the two big capital programs being worked out in time for the passage of the budget this week. One is the school construction bill, which started out as a $2.8 billion, court-ordered program to help poor districts replace aging buildings, and which has grown to $15 billion -- with money in it for wealthier districts as well. The other big bill before the Legislature is the Transportation Trust Fund, which started out paying for roads and bridges with a portion of the gasoline tax, and has since ballooned into a something-for-everyone measure with a hefty debt load built in.</p>

        <p>Taxpayers of New Jersey, look to your wallets. Next year's governor's race is already under way, and the two most powerful men in Trenton are competing for your vote with projects that could end up adding heavily to the state's debt -- debt that will have to be paid back with interest.</p>
        <p>The focus of concern about debt is in the two big capital programs being worked out in time for the passage of the budget this week. One is the school construction bill, which started out as a $2.8 billion, court-ordered program to help poor districts replace aging buildings, and which has grown to $15 billion -- with money in it for wealthier districts as well. The other big bill before the Legislature is the Transportation Trust Fund, which started out paying for roads and bridges with a portion of the gasoline tax, and has since ballooned into a something-for-everyone measure with a hefty debt load built in.</p>
        <p>From the point of view of someone who will be paying the taxes on this four or five years from now, the problem is not necessarily the size of the school construction bill but how it will be financed. Of $8.6 billion that the state estimates will be spent on school construction in the next decade, only $100 million will come from tax revenue, leaving the rest to be borrowed. According to budget calculations, the cost of that borrowing will amount to more than $6 billion.</p>
        <p>Jack Collins, the speaker of the assembly and presumably a future Republican contender for governor, is also a leading player in the school construction debate. It was Mr. Collins, after all, who offered to make the $1 billion loan fund -- interest free -- available to suburban districts. But since the debt service on that money has to come from somewhere, taxpayers will end up paying for it anyway.</p>
        <p>It was also Mr. Collins who opposed letting the courts force the state to pay 100 percent of school construction costs in poor districts on the principled constitutional ground that only the Legislature can appropriate money, not the court.  But once the courts rejected his objection, the speaker used his power adroitly to sweeten same bill with gifts to the suburban districts whose voters will choose next year's Republican candidate for governor.</p>
        <p>The Transportation Trust Fund has a similar debt load liability as the school construction fund. When it was created in the early 1980s, the fund was intended to operate on a pay-as-you-go basis, with a portion of the gas tax paying for current highway and public transportation projects, and with borrowing kept low and short-term to smooth the revenue stream for each project.</p>
        <p>But the recessions in 1989 and 1992 produced lower gas tax income levels, while demand for project spending continued to grow. Since elected officials hate to reduce spending -- only taxes -- they began borrowing to shore up the Trust Fund as it wobbled out of balance. This year, the borrowing reached $900 million.</p>
        <p>Concerned, Governor Whitman proposed a frank stopgap measure, a one-year plan while lawmakers thought of long-term solutions.</p>
        <p>But the transportation projects are popular with the voters, just as free school buildings are, and Mr. Collins and Donald T. DiFrancesco, the president of the senate and the speaker's chief competition for the Republican nomination, did not want spending to come unstuck with a campaign under way. Instead, they came up with a four-year plan that increased annual spending on roads and bridges, while responding to expressions of concern about the level of borrowing by offering to reduce annual borrowing from the current level of $900 million a year to $650 million for the next four years.</p>
        <p>But critics complain that a worthy step toward reducing debt is marred by the decision of the two leaders to make up for the lost borrowing by siphoning money from the general treasury, which only means less money for the other things the state does, like building new schools.</p>
        <p>And even at reduced levels, $650 million a year in borrowing for four years can pile up a lot of debt when it comes on top of the borrowing already committed to. Under the plan, interest payments that now run about $380 million will swell to $600 million a year by 2004. That means that nearly two-thirds of the appropriation for roads and bridges that year will go to pay interest.</p>
        <p>Jon Shure, president of New Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal research group, was critical of the Collins-DiFrancesco solution.</p>
        <p>''We've been borrowing instead of appropriating,'' Mr. Shure said, ''and we will end up paying interest with dollars that could have been put into transportation projects.''</p>
        <p>Tim Blake, a senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service, tracks New Jersey's debt load, and he, too. is watching the school construction measure and the transportation trust fund. He says most states are using the flush times to spend more and borrow less</p>
        <p>New Jersey, with a $1 billion surplus likely, is also moved in that direction, Mr. Blake said, although at a slower pace than other states.</p>
        <p>''From our perspective, school construction and transportation are the two most significant capital needs facing the state,'' Mr. Blake said, ''and it is certainly our basic view of New Jersey that debt ratios will continue their upward move over the next five or six years, at least.''</p>

        <p>Correction:  July 29, 2000, Saturday  Because of an editing error, the Political Briefing column on June 25 omitted attribution for a news account of a comment by the campaign manager of Gov. Frank O'Bannon of Indiana in an exchange about politics and rising gasoline prices. It was The Indianapolis Star to whom the campaign manager, Tom New, said ''Phooey'' when told that some Republicans saw politics behind the governor's suspension of the gasoline tax. Attribution was deleted when the column was edited to fit assigned space; The Star pointed out the omission by e-mail yesterday.</p>
