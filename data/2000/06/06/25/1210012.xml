        <p>FANS of the great Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, whose credits include ''Through the Olive Trees'' and ''Taste of Cherry'' (winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes International Film Festival in 1997), are familiar with this signature image: A man alone in his car, driving along the winding contours of bare mountains. Few know that Mr. Kiarostami has spent years traveling the same remote roads, in search of landscapes to photograph.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kiarostami's first show of photographs in the United States, organized in collaboration with the art dealer Olivier Renaud-Clement, is on view at the Andrea Rosen Gallery in Chelsea through July 14. (His most recent film, ''The Wind Will Carry Us,'' a stunningly lyrical and eloquent exploration of both rural village life and the nature of artistic responsibility, opens in New York on July 28, the same day that a five-film retrospective begins downtown at the Screening Room.)</p>
        <p>His landscapes, shot on the outskirts of Tehran, in northern Iran and in the western region of Kurdistan, share his films' spare visual poetry. A small green tree stands alone on a hillside, bathed in blue light; a tilled field waits beneath a low, cloud-filled sky; snow-filled tracks lead toward oblivion. Like his films, they are modern in their minimalism but their concerns are broadly humanist -- an art of reticence and humility before vast existential questions.</p>
        <p>Trim and dark, perpetually veiled by sunglasses, his aloof manner tempered by gentleness and humor, the 60-year-old filmmaker seems pleased to be redefining the field of his artistic activity. During the last year, while concentrating intensively on photography, he has also published a book of haikulike verses. At the loft of an artist friend in Chelsea, Mr. Kiarostami spoke of his recent trip to Uganda, where he made a short film commissioned by the United Nations about children with AIDS, and where he shot his first photographic portraits.</p>
        <p>''We were in a place where there was no electricity, no candles or torches,'' he said, speaking Farsi to a translator. ''At night, it was just dark. I photographed the children; their only response was surprise before that strange object, the camera.'' He plans an exhibition of these images to benefit children with AIDS in Africa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kiarostami began photographing landscapes during the tumult of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. ''At that time,'' he said, ''I thought my filmmaking career was finished. I was also undergoing an inner revolution.'' He was referring to the end of his marriage. ''To escape these problems, I began traveling, leaving the cities behind and photographing nature.''</p>
        <p>Yet his images remain calm and timeless. No particulars of date or location, no minarets or veiled women, mark them as exotic or the products of a particular nation.</p>
        <p>''Trees are everywhere,'' he said. ''They carry no passport. The big things in life, like nature, have no nationality.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kiarostami's long photographic practice has allowed him to reflect on time and its vicissitudes.</p>
        <p>''For 21 years, I've been photographing the same group of trees,'' he said. ''Some haven't grown at all. Their branches have turned inward. Others have become so tall. Still others have disappeared. They're on the same land, with the same water and exposed to the same light. Yet they're all different. I believe they each have their own destiny.''</p>
        <p>Photography's intimacy and its relative technical simplicity also appeal to him.</p>
        <p>''In photography, I have the chance to be alone,'' he said. ''I don't need a crew. And when you're unhappy with a photograph, you can just tear it in two. Film is different. There is capital invested. It is the seventh art, but it has become first in terms of commerce. Photography may be closer to poetry.''</p>
        <p>He refuses to speculate on his work's cultural sources. ''Fifteen years ago,'' he said, ''when my grandmother was alive, and we were driving together, she would also turn her head to look at a lonely tree, without saying a word. But just her gesture of looking so moved me.''</p>
