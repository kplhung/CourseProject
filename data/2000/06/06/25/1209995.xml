        <p>I can foresee the e-junk-mail of the next Internet generation:</p>
        <p>''Dear Joe: We know you like adult movies, but we also know you have never seen sex like this. Keep this sample with our compliments and sign up for a weekly treat.''</p>
        <p>''Dear Mary: We heard your chat room complaint about the apple cake crust. Next time try our pie plate and special mix. Just click here and be the star of your next church bazaar!''</p>
        <p>Because they can't find the word ''privacy'' in the Constitution, our courts, from the Supremes on down, are refusing to help consumers fend off horrendous intrusions into personal life. And so the Internet is fast becoming a giant spy network that gathers and peddles a record of what we read, write, watch, think and buy to make us ever more precise targets of unsolicited ads, mail and marketing ploys.</p>
        <p>The technology of intrusion now infests virtually every Web page, browser, e-mail message and chat room, and it relentlessly tracks our individual movements, interests, moods and even keystrokes. As a result there is a multivolume cyberarchive matching up tens of millions of names, addresses, ages and personal characteristics with the books and underwear we bought, the stocks we sold, the music we downloaded and the cancer facts we once pursued.</p>
        <p>Huge sums are being spent to harvest these nuggets of information and to bundle them for delivery to both online and off-line advertisers and merchants. The Big Brother industry, like most Web enterprises, is not yet earning big bucks, but it is betting that customized and fancy new Internet imagery will invade our minds to much greater effect than the catalogs and junk mail that have long filled our mailboxes.</p>
        <p>In time, the courts may wise up, but by then we may all be not only cataloged but also palm-printed and even facially digitized. Too many judges are failing to recognize the urgent need to balance the First and Fourth Amendments, the rights of corporate free speech against the right of people to ''be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects.''</p>
        <p>A few weeks ago, the Supreme Court refused even to hear an appeal from the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, which struck down a ruling of the Federal Communications Commission to limit US West's use of information about its customers. The commission wanted the phone company to ask all customers to consent to the release and ulterior use of personal information. But the court stood by the company's weak offer to make people opt out by withdrawing permission -- if they could find and decipher the obscure instructions for doing so.</p>
        <p>As you can discover on the vast majority of Web sites, that prepositional distinction between opting ''in'' and ''out'' marks the difference between meaningful and disingenuous respect for privacy. Web merchants have made a show of ''self-regulation'' by posting lengthy and complicated statements of ''privacy policies,'' many of which permit diligent readers to withdraw from some lists and warn them of intrusions by third parties. But in only a minority of cases -- like The Times's own Web site -- is the language of these cautions unambiguous. And even when clear, the warnings and instructions are not standardized; they must be hunted down and mastered on every Web page you ever visit. Also like The Times's, some major sites promise to use their customer data only in an anonymous aggregate, to help advertisers focus their messages and assess the results. But most ''policy'' statements are contradictory, hard to locate, subject to change and lacking any mechanism for enforcement or redress.</p>
        <p>If the courts persist in thus favoring property over privacy, the only real remedy is to write laws that will treat privacy as valuable property.</p>
        <p>That is hardly a radical proposition. All of us regularly and knowingly trade our privacy for commercial benefit. We accept phone calls at awkward moments for the convenience of being connected. We volunteer our Visa card numbers and leave a trail of our purchases for the comfort of shopping from home. We leave a bar-coded menu of our favorite foods for a quick supermarket checkout. Most of us have learned that the personal information we yield has commercial value. It is property that the receivers routinely sell to other merchants so that they can bombard us with solicitations tailored to our surmised lifestyles.</p>
        <p>But atomized consumers lack the power to command a decent price for this informational property. When a pollster calls me to sample my political views or tastes in food, I can refuse to answer unless he shares some of his fee. But I cannot strike a deal with the anonymous spies that pursue me online. If America's marketers really believed in a free market, they would fully expose themselves and their data traffic and let me decide whether the price is right.</p>
        <p>Instead of baiting me with offers of a ''free'' search engine, e-mail and current stock quotes, Yahoo should be required when I enter its site to define those services as payment for its right to resell my identity and online habits to other merchants. The Times's Web site should explain up front that it is not giving its news away without charge; it is bartering the news and other services to learn about reader interests for the commercial benefit of advertisers. Upon entering an iWon.com lottery for millions of dollars, I ought to be told which ''sponsors or business partners'' it says in fine print will share in the registration information I supply. And even if I keep watch, as instructed, for iWon policy changes, who will police its partners?</p>
        <p>Clearly, we need laws, like those for truth in lending, to regulate truth in surfing. Web sites should be required to adopt standardized technologies to expose the full extent of their use of personal information and to seek their customers' ''opt in'' consent. The same should be required of third parties who then buy or share that information. And any change in the deal should require a new agreement.</p>
        <p>I may welcome countless future offers that play to my interests, but I want something of value in exchange for exposing myself to strangers, for the burden on my computer and for the time I spend sorting through the flood of e-mail. If what I tell you about myself has an ulterior market value beyond our immediate Web transaction, I deserve to be told your intentions, asked to approve and be acceptably paid.</p>
