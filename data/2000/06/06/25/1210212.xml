        <p>IT sounds a little weird, but the Old World is a work in progress.</p>
        <p>Europe is in the throes of change, and investors there are only beginning to benefit from the Eurocentric capital markets system that is being built.</p>
        <p>Later this summer, for example, the European Commission is likely to give pension funds in member countries the green light to make cross-border investments. Collectively, those funds have $2 trillion in assets.</p>
        <p>All of this is old news to American money managers, who have spent the last couple of years anticipating what these changes will mean and how to profit from them.</p>
        <p>Michael Levy, head of international equities at Deutsche Asset Management and manager of the Deutsche European Equity fund, took some time last week to talk about those and other issues. Following are excerpts from the conversation:</p>
        <p>Q. Changes related to pension funds will increase the amount of cross-border investing in Europe. How are you positioning your fund to benefit from that?</p>
        <p>A. We looked at the way these markets appeared from the point of view of the managers in each country, and asked what their asset allocation was. The answer was that it was incredibly distorted. Spanish fund managers, for example, were pretty much captive to Spanish stocks, which are dominated by utilities and banks.</p>
        <p>Those who have been freed from those constraints have been moving into large companies outside their home country, names like LVMH, Total Fina Elf, Mannesmann and Nokia.</p>
        <p>Q. Aren't many European funds underweighted in stocks?</p>
        <p>A. By our standards, the exposure to equities is low.</p>
        <p>As pension funds become funded, instead of pay-as-you-go, we are going to see an increasing shift from bonds to equities. That is going to happen over the next 5 to 10 years, and is going to generate tremendous demand for stock in Europe.</p>
        <p>I have seen conservative estimates that project institutional demand for European equities to be $11 trillion between now and 2010. That is a big number, and it doesn't make any wild assumptions about equities. The demand will outstrip supply, and there will be more supply.</p>
        <p>Q. So do you expect to see a lot more companies go public?</p>
        <p>A. For the first time, a lot of companies are going to start coming to market. Companies will have the chance to raise capital in many more markets, and investors will have the choice of which ones they want to invest in.</p>
        <p>Before now, pension funds and companies were basically captive. Except for the best-rated companies, who could float debt in the Eurobond market, there has not been a capital market in Europe.</p>
        <p>Bonds rated ''A'' or below account for about 93 percent of the American corporate bond market. In Europe, it is almost the reverse.</p>
        <p>Q. Has your fund invested in any newly created companies?</p>
        <p>A. Early in the year, we positioned ourselves to invest in a number of spinoffs, including two from Siemens, Infineon and Epcos.</p>
        <p>And we have invested in companies like Reckitt Benckiser, a British company that has been taken over by Benckiser, a very successful Dutch family-owned concern.</p>
        <p>Q. What are some of your other holdings?</p>
        <p>A. Vodafone AirTouch is a large position, even though we are underweight the United Kingdom. At the start of the year, we held a number of blue chips like Philips, Siemens, Telefonica and Nokia. We own companies like Intershop, a German software company, and Total Fina Elf has been very exciting, and is one of our largest positions.</p>
        <p>Q. Does the move to create one European market with a common currency mean the Continent is less vulnerable to swings in the American business cycle?</p>
        <p>A. There is no way Europe or anywhere else would not be impacted by a recession here. However, the euro zone does about 90 percent of its trading within the European Union itself. So they are about as closed a market as the U.S. is.</p>
        <p>A recession would create some spillover, but not as great as in the past. And if the U.S. is able to pull off a soft landing, there would be practically no effect.</p>
        <p>Q. Do European markets represent a good opportunity for American investors?</p>
        <p>A. Some of the markets are doing better than others. France and Sweden are doing all right. The United Kingdom has had a hard time, because sterling was too strong.</p>
        <p>That said, there is no question this is a great time to get in. Whether or not the euro has another bout of weakness, it is an oversold, undervalued currency.</p>
        <p>The weaker euro gives dollar investors a nice window and provides a nice tailwind for European economies and countries to restructure.</p>
