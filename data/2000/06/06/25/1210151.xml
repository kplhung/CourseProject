        <p>Bronxville High School has recalled its 2000 yearbook because of inappropriate content. A school official said the yearbook had a picture of a student with his buttocks exposed, two others in a simulated sexual pose and a section that read, ''You know you're from Westchester if . . . ,'' which included the statement, ''You recall your Jamaican nanny with great fondness.'' Superintendent of Schools John Chambers said it would cost thousands of dollars to recall the yearbooks, ''but it has to be done.''</p>
