        <p>The timing is more intriguing than anyone could have predicted.</p>
        <p>Westchester County wants to find veterans who served in Korea, in what is often called ''the forgotten war.'' And yet, as recent headlines about the meeting of the leaders of North and South Korea make clear, many people have never forgotten that conflict, not for a single day in the last 50 years.</p>
        <p>On July 1, the county will honor its Korean War veterans in connection with a millennium celebration in downtown White Plains. It hopes to give out medals to more than 1,000 veterans in a ceremony at 9 a.m. at the Westchester County Courthouse, 111 Martin Luther King Boulevard. The ceremony will kick off a full day of activities, including a parade that will begin at 11 a.m. at Martine Avenue and King Boulevard; organizers say the best viewing points are the corners of Main and North Broadway and Hamilton and South Broadway.</p>
        <p>Applications for the medal are available at the Veterans Service Agency at 150 Grand Street in White Plains, or at the Westchester County Clerk's Office, legal division. Forms can also be downloaded from the county home page on the Internet: westchestergov.com.</p>
        <p>More information is available from H. Gaylord Worrell, director of the Veterans Service Agency, at (914) 285-2145.</p>
