        <p>AMERICANS still work out at health clubs because it is not yet fashionable to get sick and die. But in a few years, the baby boomers are going to be entering the prime perishing years, and we all know what that means. They're going to turn dying into a form of self-expression.</p>
        <p>Each and every last boomer is going to strive to make his or her death a unique and fulfilling ritual. They're going to be taking adult education classes on the joys of dying well. They'll have brunch discussions about what music should be on the stereo as one drifts off into the afterlife. They'll say things like, ''I don't want to just die, I want to claim ownership of my death,'' and they'll start buying self-actualizing books with titles like, ''The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Dead People.'' In short, the boomers are going to take death and they're going to turn it into a growth experience.</p>

        <p>AMERICANS still work out at health clubs because it is not yet fashionable to get sick and die. But in a few years, the baby boomers are going to be entering the prime perishing years, and we all know what that means. They're going to turn dying into a form of self-expression.</p>
        <p>Each and every last boomer is going to strive to make his or her death a unique and fulfilling ritual. They're going to be taking adult education classes on the joys of dying well. They'll have brunch discussions about what music should be on the stereo as one drifts off into the afterlife. They'll say things like, ''I don't want to just die, I want to claim ownership of my death,'' and they'll start buying self-actualizing books with titles like, ''The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Dead People.'' In short, the boomers are going to take death and they're going to turn it into a growth experience.</p>
        <p>Already, you can see the age-old rituals being personalized. San Francisco has its own Zen hospice, which -- and I couldn't make this up -- is about to start training ''death companions'' or, as they will also be known, ''midwives of death.'' The Paradise Memorial Crematory outside Scottsdale, Ariz., has a Cremation Cam, which offers Internet broadcasts of cremations (up to but not into the oven). There are Web sites like ObitDetails.com, where you can post obituaries online, and plan4ever.com, where families can have memorial chat rooms. Soon you'll be able to spam people from beyond the grave.</p>
        <p>A company called Celestic Inc. will blast some of your ''cremains'' to the moon for about $12,500, using a rocket launched by a commercial space company from either Vandenberg Air Force Base or Cape Canaveral. That means during the last years of your life, you can look down on those dull vanillas whose ashes are going on less-extreme adventure vacations than yours are. In dot-com rich San Francisco, there is fierce competition for water-view burial plots, with prices for a family plot skyrocketing over $100,000, which means that dying has become yet one more thing you can't do without a real estate agent.</p>
        <p>And of course, there have already been striking changes in coffin and mausoleum design. Coffins now come in an infinite array of looks. A Dallas-based firm, Whitelight, can put a digitally imaged mural on any ''art casket,'' so people are going six feet under with designs like ''Fairway to Heaven'' -- a golf course scene -- and zebra stripes. It's only a matter of time before some boomer gets lowered down in a container that looks like the album cover of Pink Floyd's ''Dark Side of the Moon.''</p>
        <p>The end result is that we baby boomers are going to transform the next world just as much as we have transformed this one. It is not enough that we are going to bankrupt the Social Security system, give the entire country the demographic profile of Florida and annoy the planet with our midlife crises. Now we are going to start having afterlife crises, wondering if our souls are fully self-actualized.</p>
        <p>As for myself, I am preparing for a little post-mortem one-upmanship. I am laying the groundwork for a truly high-status death. As I conceive it, my own death takes place many decades hence at my yet imaginary regular table at the Four Seasons. I have just received news that my grandchildren have managed to find time during their Supreme Court clerkships to collaborate on another best-selling poetry anthology. I beckon to my assistant, Tina Brown, to read me their latest e-mail again, and I celebrate by ordering some penne off-menu. But I'm not really paying attention to the freshness and coloring of my dish as the waiter settles it in front of me, and instead of enjoying a routine power lunch I become yet another baby boomer victim of pesto poisoning.</p>
        <p>I get dizzy and see a long blue tunnel of light, and coming down it, the Angel of Death. But it's a special baby boomer Angel of Death. She's wearing a North Face parka instead of a black robe, and instead of a scythe she's got a gardening trowel from Smith &amp; Hawken. And as she gets closer, I see that it's Oprah, who apparently gets to decide not only which novels will succeed and which will fail, but also who will live and who will die.</p>
        <p>She tells me I am being recycled, which is the new phrase for it, and she invites me over to her table, which is in a better location than mine. The heads of the Harvard, Yale and New York Public Libraries are seated there already squabbling over my papers. The Angel of Death asks me if I have already detailed my funeral arrangements on my Palm Pilot, which of course I have. First I give her the name of the funeral home I have selected, the one in Alphabet City where all the supermodels go. Then I beam over my embalming instructions; I've asked to be pumped full of a '69 Bordeaux because my motto is, ''Embalmed but Not Embarrassed.'' I want an open casket, and in preparation, I'd like a surgeon to get rid of the bags under my eyes.</p>
        <p>I don't look at my remains as a corpse, but as my last chance for cosmetic surgery. As for the casket, I have a few special instructions: a sisal interior, because it's so unpretentious, and a translucent shell, so I don't clash with my iMac. I also want to have a University of Chicago window sticker attached to the back of my box, for the sake of educational boasting, and maybe one of those ACK stickers that signify that I once visited Nantucket.</p>
        <p>I've selected a cemetery up the Hudson that bills itself as ''America's Ultimate Gated Community.'' And I confess I've gone a little overboard on my mausoleum. Actually, I've selected one of those McMausoleums -- the big marble structures with two-story great rooms, four-car garages and newly renovated kitchens. It's vulgar, I know, but I couldn't see spending all of eternity without a Jacuzzi in the master bathroom suite.</p>
        <p>I can see the Angel of Death is impressed by the care I have taken with my arrangements, and she mutters something about looking forward to telling Narcissus. As a final gesture, I blast-fax the obituary I've written for myself, with instructions to run it above the fold. And then I settle back and prepare to meet my Maker, secure in the knowledge I have achieved the boomer ultimate: I have gone from ashes to ashes, dust to dust, without once stopping along the way at maturity.</p>
