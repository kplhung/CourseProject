        <p>Hollywood was stunned last summer when Kenn Viselman's Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Company beat out several big studios for the merchandising and film rights to the Eloise books, the classic 1950's children's series about a cheeky little girl who lives in Manhattan's Plaza Hotel. Variety called it ''not just an itsy bitsy surprise: it was a shock.''</p>

        <p>Hollywood was stunned last summer when Kenn Viselman's Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Company beat out several big studios for the merchandising and film rights to the Eloise books, the classic 1950's children's series about a cheeky little girl who lives in Manhattan's Plaza Hotel. Variety called it ''not just an itsy bitsy surprise: it was a shock.''</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Viselman loved Eloise's comic antics, it wasn't just the appeal of the character that turned his head. As the man behind the marketing of ''Teletubbies,'' Mr. Viselman saw in the Eloise books a long-term brand franchise that could be transformed into everything from dolls to a television series to a string of feature films.</p>
        <p>''You can build a brand or you can build a movie franchise: a brand generates a lot more money and a lot more exposure over time,'' Mr. Viselman said. ''A successful book will sell 100,000 copies. A hundred million is a successful movie, but a successful licensing program can do $1 billion in its first year.''</p>
        <p>The Eloise licensing program is still in its infancy, so exactly how much cash it generates remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: in this year of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter, Eloise will have lots of famous company from the world of children's literature: Dr. Seuss's Grinch, ''Clifford the Big Red Dog'' by Norman Bridwell and ''Curious George'' by H. A. and Margaret Rey.</p>
        <p>All are getting expanded merchandising, from key chains and lunch boxes to puzzles and CD-ROM's, as the licensing of children's book characters becomes a story in itself.</p>
        <p>The spotlight is on book characters at a moment when movie marketing has slowed and Harry Potter has captured the imagination of millions. The Potter books -- the latest one will be published next month -- are the most obvious touchstones. But the exploitation of book characters also fits into a trend of conservatism in the often-brazen world of licensing.</p>
        <p>Some of the wariness stems from the outrageous expectations and hype of films like last summer's ''Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' Book characters, in contrast, are recognizable brand names with an established fan base that presumably makes them easier to sell as broader media and merchandising properties. Classic books also appeal to adults, who are gatekeepers in the children's market.</p>
        <p>This week, Eloise and the others will be on display at Licensing 2000 International, the annual trade show of the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers Association, which opens Tuesday at the Javits Convention Center in New York.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of buzz around Harry Potter and around Eloise -- these are two very big deals,'' said Charles M. Riotto, president of the trade group. ''But it's part of the whole trend. Even before Potter or without it, you'd still see this move into building the publishing segment. There's a higher comfort level to deal with properties that have an established audience base.''</p>
        <p>Warner Brothers, which has the worldwide rights for Harry Potter, will begin releasing selected products based on the first book in the fall, with another round next year linked to release of a feature film.</p>
        <p>The Universal Studios Consumer Products Group, a unit of Seagram has awarded licenses to 70 companies to produce merchandise tied to the holiday release of Dr. Seuss's ''How The Grinch Stole Christmas!'' directed by Ron Howard and starring Jim Carrey.</p>
        <p>And after years as a book, ''Clifford The Big Red Dog'' is being turned by Scholastic Entertainment into a television series on PBS this fall, with the actor John Ritter as the voice of Clifford and the Nickelodeon star Kel Mitchell as the voice of his friend T-bone.</p>
        <p>Itsy Bitsy Entertainment will turn Eloise -- who made her debut as a fancy doll at F.A.O. Schwarz -- into the first of several feature films next year and is also working on an animated children's series.</p>
        <p>Universal has awarded licenses to 150 companies to produce Curious George products -- triple the number of companies three years ago -- and it plans to bring the little monkey to the screen.</p>
        <p>The licensing of children's book characters is not new. Indeed, licensing based on the characters of Beatrix Potter, which include Peter Rabbit and Squirrel Nutkin, dates back almost a century, and there are a lot of perennial favorites like ''Winnie The Pooh'' and ''The Wizard of Oz.''</p>
        <p>But last year, the business of licensing publishing properties saw a 33 percent increase in royalty revenues to $40 million, according to a study by licensing industry association. Even some adult book series are benefiting, like ''Chicken Soup for the Soul,'' which is now a television series and a board game.</p>
        <p>''Literary properties are great assets because they have a history and a familiarity,'' said Dan Romanelli, the president of Warner Brothers Worldwide Consumer Products. ''Today there is some risk involved in any business, but when you have 20 million books sold like Harry Potter, and a fourth about to be released, you know that there's continuity, and that's difficult to find.''</p>
        <p>Also, there is no one big movie this year, like ''The Lion King'' or ''Jurassic Park,'' that would drive a huge merchandising onslaught.</p>
        <p>And the industry is wary. Walt Disney, a virtual marketing machine, has not had a blockbuster movie merchandising property for some time, said Mr. Viselman. The Star Wars film generated an estimated $1 billion in retail sales, but that was not always enough for companies to cover the cost of the licenses and still make a profit. Producers saturated the market, and some retailers were stuck with too many products.</p>
        <p>''The expectation of how much you could do got so out of hand that people lost all sense of reality as to what was possible,'' said Marty Brochstein, executive editor of The Licensing Letter in New York. ''It was a marketing machine that fed on itself, and a lot of people ended up paying the price.''</p>
        <p>Book publishers say it is exactly this kind of fad-chasing that is playing into the growth of treasured book characters. At Scholastic Inc., the executive vice president Deborah Forte said she sensed a growing weariness among retailers.</p>
        <p>''All of this hype for a six-week window, and then they have to find the next big thing,'' she said. ''I think the longevity and sustainability of publishing properties tends to be better than some of the just-media properties.''</p>
        <p>Overpromotion is a concern in expanding book characters as well, and Mr. Viselman and others said they are carefully controlling expansion of their product to avoid saturation. Warner is so concerned about keeping a brand franchise for Harry Potter over the long term that it went to Madison Avenue for help and hired Grey Advertising to advise the company on building a brand.</p>
        <p>Of course, the book character trend is just one inside the $74 billion licensing industry that spans a broad spectrum of businesses and pop culture. The publishing category generated some $1.3 billion in retail sales last year, a tiny portion compared with huge categories like the $17.9 billion business of corporate branding, or the $15.9 billion in licensed retail sales from the entertainment industry, according to The Licensing Letter.</p>
        <p>Some of the classics are coming to life now by sheer happenstance. The Eloise books became available after the death in 1998 of the author, Kay Thompson, who did not market the property. Licensing around Dr. Seuss occurred after the widow of the author Theodor Seuss Geisel learned that copyright laws required her to use the rights or risk losing them.</p>
        <p>One big reason books make popular licensing is that they have inherent value as an educational tool. Parents, who wield some control over these purchases, often prefer book properties in a world where shielding children from violent and inappropriate material is a daily chore.</p>
        <p>''Books in world culture are viewed as very important and well-respected,'' said Nancy Cushing-Jones, Universal Consumer Products' president for publishing rights. ''A good book has an intrinsic value that a T-shirt doesn't have. And the process of bonding with kids through reading is extremely important.''</p>
        <p>But Seth Siegel, co-chairman of the Beanstalk Group, a licensing agency and consulting firm in New York, said the entire trend is simply entertainment licensing, albeit inspired from books. He said the classics have been around forever, but the products do not move off the shelves until they are made into a media property.</p>
        <p>''We haven't elevated literary properties,'' he said. ''We've just given Hollywood another way of taking pop culture icons and turning them into images that can be absorbed by the mass population.''</p>
        <p>And what will become of it all? Mr. Siegel predicts a rash of children's stories will be turned into films followed by a few wild successes and then, the inevitable losers.</p>
        <p>''And then one day we'll be reading a trend report that says properties based on books don't work,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''I think it was Balzac that once said all fashion ends in excess. He was speaking of something else. But he should have been speaking of the licensing industry.''</p>
