        <p>Roughly 40 minutes had gone by since Gustavo Kuerten had begun walking merrily toward the net to celebrate his second French Open title, roughly 40 minutes since a crosscourt backhand struck by Magnus Norman had been called out by a line judge only to be overruled by the chair umpire, Francois Pareau, to Kuerten's stupefaction.</p>
        <p>''It was like I was watching white and he was watching black,'' Kuerten said.</p>

        <p>Roughly 40 minutes had gone by since Gustavo Kuerten had begun walking merrily toward the net to celebrate his second French Open title, roughly 40 minutes since a crosscourt backhand struck by Magnus Norman had been called out by a line judge only to be overruled by the chair umpire, Francois Pareau, to Kuerten's stupefaction.</p>
        <p>''It was like I was watching white and he was watching black,'' Kuerten said.</p>
        <p>Roughly 40 minutes, and the fifth-seeded Brazilian was still on Center Court today, still in the fourth set chasing down Norman's heavy forehands and trying his best to forget all the match points that had gone by. He had squandered three in the 10th game, four more in a marathon 12th game and three more in the ensuing tie breaker.</p>
        <p>Ten match points in all; 10 opportunities to raise his skinny arms overhead and hug his coach and confidant, Larri Passos. There was no precedent for this kind of frustration in a Grand Slam final. A lesser man would have been an emotional wreck, screaming at the shifting sky and heaping insults on the umpire. But Kuerten, a lesser man once, stayed calm. At 6-6 in the tie breaker, he fired a first serve at Norman's body that the Swede could not quite handle to earn his 11th match point.</p>
        <p>By now, the crowd was shellshocked: worn out, like the players, from anticipation and lack of resolution. There was not much buzz as Norman prepared to serve, little emotion from Kuerten as he stood 12 feet behind the baseline. But when the next rally ended with Norman hitting a forehand wide, this 3-hour-44-minute match -- as much an ordeal as a spectacle -- was over. Kuerten, no longer a one-Slam wonder, was the winner, 6-2, 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (6).</p>
        <p>''Of course you start to think, especially because the first match point I thought the ball was out, so for me it was over,'' the fifth-seeded Kuerten said. ''Every time I missed another chance, I was still thinking about that. It was really strange: the points keep passing and you don't realize if it's going to be O.K. or not.''</p>
        <p>Just as in 1997, it turned out beautifully for the man the Brazilians call Guga. Just as in 1997, he won with his 80-something grandmother Olga Schlosser in the stands after she flew in from Brazil, and with his nation's green and yellow flag fluttering in the stands and a band waiting in the wings. Just as in 1997, he won by generating remarkable pace and depth from the baseline and by demonstrating slightly surreal endurance.</p>
        <p>But this title, like any second Grand Slam title, was a different psychological challenge. In 1997, Kuerten was ranked 66th, had a room in a two-star hotel and was a household name only in his beach-side hometown of Florianopolis.</p>
        <p>A year later, he was upset early in singles and ended up being disqualified from the doubles after throwing his racket in frustration and narrowly missing the chair umpire's head. A tearful Kuerten later issued a written apology.</p>
        <p>But this year, there would be no such melodrama, and he was on the very short list of favorites from the beginning. He has improved his serve considerably since 1997 and was undisputably the most consistent clay-court player over the last two seasons. Last month, he lost to Norman in the final in Rome and then beat him en route to winning the title in Hamburg, Germany, a week later.</p>
        <p>''I think this shows that I'm really one of the top players -- a guy who will stay around,'' Kuerten said in his pleasantly fractured English. ''People maybe thought I'd win one time and be finished. So I think right now with my name again here in the history, I think I put myself as one of the players who can stay for a long time in the tennis.''</p>
        <p>Kuerten has also reached the quarterfinals at the United States Open and, more surprisingly because of his grip changes and long backswings, at Wimbledon. He also reached the final in Key Biscayne, Fla., this year, losing in a tight match to Pete Sampras. But clay is where he remains most dangerous.</p>
        <p>In 1997, Kuerten won three five-set matches on his way to the trophy. This time, despite a suspect back that bothered him earlier in the clay-courts season, he stared down defeat against Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the quarterfinals and Juan Carlos Ferrero in the semifinals, rallying from two-sets-to-one deficits in both instances. Against Kafelnikov, he was down by 2-4, 15-40 in the fourth set, as well.</p>
        <p>''Kafelnikov was my worst nightmare, I can say,'' Kuerten said. ''I was not feeling my game. He was controlling the match. Somehow things changed.''</p>
        <p>They changed today, as well, and this time Kuerten was the one whose lead started to erode. For two sets, Norman played far less than his best and occasionally threw his racket, making this final between the two top players in the yearlong points race anticlimactic. With shot after shot striking the net, Norman kept twisting away and bellowing.</p>
        <p>''You know I wanted it so much,'' said Norman, who was playing in his first Grand Slam final. ''I was standing on my back foot when I played the forehand today. The other matches I've been going through the ball. Today I was playing too defensive in the beginning. I didn't feel good out there. I was not nervous. Things just didn't go my way.''</p>
        <p>That changed in the third set and early in the fourth, when Norman broke Kuerten in the first game and took a 2-0 lead. But Guga would soon even the score and they would trade breaks and groundstrokes with great intensity, if not always great efficiency, until the end.</p>
        <p>It was hardly a great match, but the way it finished (and did not finish) was unquestionably great theater. With Norman serving at 4-5 in the final set, he soon fell behind by 15-40. On the second match point, after Pareau had overruled on the first, Kuerten knocked a forehand long, with Norman shouting ''Come on!' before it even landed.</p>
        <p>The Swede saved another match point that game and then dodged four more on his next service game, which stretched to nine deuces and lasted for 21 minutes. But after making up a 3-6 deficit in the tie breaker, Norman's great escape finally came to an end along with his lead in the points race. Kuerten is the new No. 1.</p>
        <p>''I had the feeling I could win all the time until the last point, until I saw the forehand go out,'' Norman said. ''I still feel like if I could play the match again. . . . ''</p>
        <p>His voice trailed off, and as it did a group of Brazilian fans kept thumping drums in the distance as they danced a victory lap around the stadium.</p>
