        <p>Both President Clinton and Gov. George W. Bush would like the Pentagon to get along with fewer nuclear warheads, and the Russians are eager for talks to push the numbers down. But top American military officers insist that current nuclear policy prevents them from shrinking our arsenal to fewer than 2,000 to 2,500 strategic weapons -- and that going lower would threaten our security. The reason for their position is a matter of simple arithmetic, buried in the nation's strategic war plan and ultimately linked to presidential guidance.</p>
        <p>Defense officials do not talk openly about the nuclear targets in the strategic plan. But for 25 years, beginning with a background in the Strategic Air Command, I have studied strategic policy and operations and have had extensive contacts with officials who are knowledgeable in these areas. I have been able to develop current estimates, and they lead inexorably to a conclusion that our leaders are clinging to outdated planning that helps keep an unnecessarily large number of American and Russian missiles pointed at one another on hair-trigger alert.</p>
        <p>The strategic war plan consists of a very long list of targets in Russia and a shorter list of targets in China. The Pentagon says the United States must be able to destroy these targets to meet current presidential guidance on nuclear war planning, a directive issued in late 1997 to get the number of warheads down from even higher levels required in earlier plans.</p>
        <p>Oddly enough, the target list has been growing instead of contracting since the last strategic arms reduction treaty, Start II, was signed in 1993. The list has grown by 20 percent over the last five years alone, according to top military and former administration officials. The vast bulk of the targets are in Russia. Three other former republics of the Soviet Union -- Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan -- were dropped from the strategic plan in 1997, yet the list of sites the Pentagon says we must be ready to destroy has grown from 2,500 in 1995 to 3,000 now.</p>
        <p>My research and interviews indicate that there are about 2,260 so-called vital Russian targets on the list today, only 1,100 of them actual nuclear arms sites within Russia. By this calculation, we have nuclear weapons aimed at 500 ''conventional'' targets -- the buildings and bases of a hollow Russian army on the verge of disintegration; 160 leadership targets, like government offices and military command centers, in a country practically devoid of leadership; and 500 mostly crumbling factories that produced almost no armaments last year.</p>
        <p>American strategic planners have historically set the level of damage that they wish to inflict on vital targets at 80 percent. This is tantamount to requiring our forces to be able to destroy 80 percent of the 2,260 Russian targets, which in turn requires the ability to deliver nearly 1,800 warheads to their targets. It is no accident that we have about 2,200 strategic warheads on alert, according to numbers provided by Strategic Command officers. Virtually all of our missiles on land are ready for launch in two minutes, and those on four submarines, two in the Atlantic and two in the Pacific, are ready to launch on 15 minutes' notice, officers say. The land-based missiles must leave the ground fast enough to be sure of being in the air before Russian missiles can destroy them.</p>
        <p>If 1,800 warheads have to be delivered quickly, the Pentagon says, we need a larger arsenal because of the demands of maintenance. For instance, typically 6 to 7 of the 18 nuclear-armed submarines are port-bound at any time and cannot be counted on to survive and deliver nuclear warheads if we are attacked. Thus the United States needs one-third more sea-based strategic weapons than it can expect to deliver in wartime.</p>
        <p>And Russia is not our missiles' only target. Responding to the 1997 presidential guidance, the Pentagon put China back into the strategic plan after a hiatus of about 20 years. For China, we now have two so-called limited attack options, involving a handful of nuclear weapons on submarines and bombers, for striking nuclear targets, leadership sites and critical industries. Compare this with scores of limited attack options against Russia, each using from a handful of weapons to more than 100, as well as a few major attack options, the smallest of which would send more than 1,000 strategic warheads to attack Russia's nuclear complex.</p>
        <p>There are also many hundreds of secondary targets in China, Iran, Iraq and North Korea that have weapons assigned to them, though not on immediate alert, further driving up the size of the arsenal.</p>
        <p>Add it all up, and at least 2,500 American warheads are deemed necessary to carry out nuclear war against Russia and China, countries that Al Gore recently said represent our vital partners, not our enemies.</p>
        <p>Getting to below 2,000 warheads will be difficult unless the target requirements are eased by new presidential guidance. Of course they could be, if our leaders would bring our war plans up to date. No thoughtful American general, much less any political leader, really believes that deterrence depends on the scale of nuclear bombing with which Russia and the United States now threaten each other.</p>
        <p>Almost without exception, our leaders regard the attack options that unleash thousands of nuclear warheads as absurd and grotesque. They do not believe that a cold-blooded, deliberate nuclear strike by either Russia or the United States is remotely plausible. The only circumstances for nuclear war that they do consider plausible involve the use of one or a handful of nonstrategic weapons, like nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, against a country other than Russia.</p>
        <p>Deterrence would remain robust with far smaller arsenals on far lower levels of alert. The United States and Russia should aim to cut the numbers of their nuclear weapons to the low hundreds and to take all of them off hair-trigger alert, with a view to eventually eliminating them under existing treaty obligations. As a first step, the United States could drop to 1,500 warheads, the ceiling the Russians are pushing for.</p>
        <p>Such a force could consist of 10 submarines armed with a total of 480 warheads; 300 Minuteman III land-based missiles with one warhead apiece; 20 B-2 bombers with 16 weapons apiece, for 320; and 50 B-52 bombers modified to carry 8 warheads apiece, for 400.</p>
        <p>A better option would be to retire the B-2 and B-52 nuclear bomber force from the arsenal and have the submarines in this mix carry 1,200 warheads. But planners cringe at the thought of removing a leg from the vaunted triad -- the mix of missiles, submarines and bombers carrying nuclear weapons -- a vestige of cold war rivalry between the Navy and the Air Force.</p>
        <p>Even without relying on launch on warning, 1,500 warheads would be more than adequate to destroy 250 targets of any choice in retaliation for any surprise attack under normal conditions, and to destroy 1,000 targets in retaliation to an attack in a crisis. If the threat of this much nuclear retaliation does not deter a prospective adversary, it is difficult to conceive of anything that would.</p>
