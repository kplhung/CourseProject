        <p>THE first time the son filled out an entry form for the United States Open, the father, who had played in the 1955 Open, had some words of advice.</p>
        <p>''This is the national championship,'' the father said. ''When you send your entry in, you put your real name on the entry form, your full name.''</p>
        <p>For nearly two decades the son did just that, writing ''William Payne Stewart.'' But for the 100th United States Open, which begins Thursday at Pebble Beach, that name was not on an entry form. The golfer who won last year's Open with a dramatic 15-foot par putt at Pinehurst No. 2 died Oct. 25 on a ghostly Learjet that plunged into a South Dakota field.</p>
        <p>For the first time in half a century, there will be no defending champion in the United States Open.</p>
        <p>Not since 1949, when Ben Hogan was recuperating from severe injuries sustained when his Cadillac was crushed by a Greyhound bus on a Texas highway, has the reigning Open champion not teed off in defense of the title. And never had the reigning champion died before the next Open.</p>
        <p>In that sense, it will be an empty Open without Stewart, who also won the 1991 Open at Hazeltine National outside Minneapolis.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, the defending champion tees off with the British Open champion and the United States Amateur champion in the first two rounds before the 36-hole cut. Stewart's slot will be filled by Jack Nicklaus, a four-time Open champion, in a threesome with Scotland's Paul Lawrie and the Texas amateur David Gossett.</p>
        <p>In Stewart's honor, the United States Golf Association, which governs all the national championships, has planned a sunrise service at 7 a.m. Wednesday near Pebble Beach's 18th tee.</p>
        <p>''In accordance with Tracey's wishes,'' said David Fay, the U.S.G.A. executive director, referring to Stewart's widow, ''the service will be a tribute to Payne, not a memorial.''</p>
        <p>Tracey Stewart and her two children, Chelsea and Aaron, will also attend a Tuesday evening celebration of more than two dozen living Open champions.</p>
        <p>Stewart almost won two other Opens, finishing second to Lee Janzen both in 1993 at Baltusrol and 1998 at Olympic, but his defining moment occurred at Pinehurst.</p>
        <p>In her memoir, ''Payne Stewart: The Authorized Biography (Broadman and Holman), Tracey Stewart, an Australian who met her husband in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, when he was playing on the Asian Tour, wrote of a suggestion she made after Saturday's round. He had shot a spotty 72, mostly because of poor putting. As she watched, she noticed that when he putted, he made the mistake of moving his head.</p>
        <p>''You need to keep your head down,'' she told him later. ''You're trying to watch the ball go in rather than keeping your head down.''</p>
        <p>In the dusk at Pinehurst that Saturday, Stewart spent 45 minutes on the putting green with one thought: not moving his head.</p>
        <p>In his duel with Phil Mickelson in Sunday's final round, Stewart made an undulating 25-foot putt at the 16th hole to tie for the lead, then took the lead with a 3-foot birdie putt at the short 17th. Minutes later, he sank the winning 15-footer on the 18th green.</p>
        <p>''I did it,'' he told Tracey as they hugged. ''I kept my head down. All day, I did it. I kept my head down.''</p>
        <p>Over the years, other Open champions have thrown the winning golf ball to the gallery around the 18th green, but after Stewart's ball clunked into the cup on that 15-foot putt, he grabbed it, kissed it and slipped it into his pocket. This ball was a keeper.</p>
        <p>Other Open champions have eventually donated one of their Open-winning clubs for display in Golf House, the U.S.G.A. headquarters in Far Hills, N.J., as Ben Hogan did with the 1-iron he used at Merion in his comeback victory in the 1950 Open.</p>
        <p>Stewart died too quickly for that, but maybe the putter that sank the 15-footer, the longest putt to win the Open, will be there someday.</p>
        <p>Hauntingly, before that final round Stewart watched an NBC television segment on him and his father, Bill Stewart, the Missouri amateur who shot 83-88 in that 1955 Open at Olympic in San Francisco, the father who advised the son to put his real name, his full name, on his Open entry form. The son who would win the Open twice.</p>
