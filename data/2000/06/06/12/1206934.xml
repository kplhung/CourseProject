        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Commies and Demmies'' (column, June 6), Thomas L. Friedman writes that because ''China is now committed to capitalism with W.T.O. characteristics,'' it will have to move toward ''an independent judiciary'' and ''W.T.O. rules, not Communist Party whims.''</p>
        <p>But while Chinese membership in the World Trade Organization is a worthwhile experiment, every act of that government leads to the reverse logic. The power-shrinking unacceptability of an independent judiciary and loss of party control probably means that China is not in fact committed to capitalism with W.T.O. characteristics.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, I expect to see Communist Party stonewalling and tokenism on the liberalizing front, while the party exploits whatever painless gains it can extract from W.T.O. membership.</p>
