        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and his fellow Republicans are beginning seven weeks of difficult politics around the issue of abortion.

        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and his fellow Republicans are beginning seven weeks of difficult politics around the issue of abortion. It is a potentially divisive element in his decision on a running mate, his handling of the party's platform and the moderate, upbeat image he seeks to project at the party's convention in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Some analysts give Mr. Bush high marks so far for sending conciliatory signals to both sides on the issue,  including openly considering potential running mates who support abortion rights while embracing his party's strict anti-abortion stand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's opponents assert that his overtures to the middle are mere symbolic gestures. The next seven weeks, they say, will show Mr. Bush siding, ultimately and firmly, with his party's social conservatives on abortion. ''We think this flirting with moderation is very cynical, and we hope American women will see it for what it is,'' said Alice Germond, executive vice president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, which has endorsed Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the Bush campaign, said, ''The governor's record and his inclusive tone speaks for itself.''</p>
        <p>Already, Mr. Bush and Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, the party's platform chairman, have served notice that they want to preserve the current platform position on abortion, which calls for a ban on the practice, without exception, and the appointment of judges who respect ''the sanctity of innocent human life.''</p>
        <p>The political risk for Mr. Bush is that his effort to satisfy his conservative base could undermine his appeal to the center. The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, conducted May 10-13, showed that 15 percent of the independents said abortion should not be permitted; 22 percent of the suburban voters responded that way. Among Republicans, 32 percent supported a total ban.</p>
        <p>Another risk for Mr. Bush: If Republican abortion rights supporters decide to fight on the platform, it would inject a rough ideological struggle into the upbeat convention he seeks. Just because Mr. Bush has signaled his intentions on the platform, ''it doesn't mean everything is in his control,'' said Ann Stone, head of Republicans for Choice. ''Ask Bob Dole.'' She was alluding to the Republican nominee's efforts four years ago to add a ''tolerance'' provision expressing room for other views on abortion, an effort that was quashed by social conservatives.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders are trying their best to mute the issue this time around. Party strategists grumble that the news media will, nevertheless, declare what one called ''abortion month'' -- a focus that will be intensified when the Supreme Court soon hands down an important ruling  on the constitutionality of Nebraska's law on a procedure opponents call ''partial birth'' abortion.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the abortion issue has become a major subplot in Mr. Bush's selection of a running mate. ''They've got a situation where if they pick a pro-choice candidate, they've got enormous worries about the convention,'' one Republican strategist said of the Bush campaign, speaking on the condition that he not be identified. ''And if they don't pick one,'' the strategist added, the criticism will be ''you guys didn't have the guts to pick a pro-choice vice president.''</p>
        <p>Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, said: ''If Bush doesn't pick a pro-choice running mate, it gives the pro-choice movement credibility to say he also won't pick pro-choice judges for the Supreme Court.''</p>
        <p>In general, both sides argue that Mr. Bush could pay a price if he rebuffs their constituents. Anti-abortion leaders have long argued that their rank and file has greater intensity on the issue than supporters of abortion rights -- and is far more likely to cast a vote on the basis of it.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the New York Times/CBS News Poll in February found that 70 percent of those supporting a ban on abortion said it was ''very important'' that their presidential candidate shared their views; only 26 percent of those who supported abortion being available to all said it was ''very important'' that their candidate agreed.</p>
        <p>''It's been very beneficial for the Republican Party to be a pro-life party,'' said Darla St. Martin, associate executive director of the National Right to Life Committee. ''And I think they will continue to be a pro-life party.''</p>
        <p>Republicans who support abortion rights, though, argue that the party's position hurts its candidates and its image in subtle and complicated ways. ''It's representative of a number of issues beyond abortion,'' said Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine. ''We have to demonstrate that we're not reflexively ideological. Clearly, Governor Bush is not.'' She added, ''I would think the logical step would be to have platform reflect an inclusive tone.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stone said that she told Governor Thompson, in a meeting last week, that the party needs to ease the fears of Republican abortion rights supporters who worry about the impact of a Republican Congress and White House on Supreme Court nominees. While Mr. Bush has declined to embrace an abortion litmus test for judicial nominees, his support for a platform that includes one is sure to be used against him this fall, many strategists agree. (Mr. Bush has indicated that he also supports exceptions to a ban on abortion for cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at stake, although the platform includes none.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Stone said efforts are already under way to influence the makeup of the platform committee; down the road, abortion rights supporters also have the option of trying to gather a majority of six state delegations necessary to suspend the rules and allow a debate on abortion on the floor of the convention.</p>
        <p>But, after eight years out of power, with a nominee ahead in the polls, no wing of the party may be in the mood for a messy internal fight.</p>
        <p>Former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, a veteran of the abortion rights struggle in the Republican Party, said, ''It's a lose-lose proposition in a way.''</p>
        <p>''On the one hand, pro-choice Republicans don't really want to do anything to help the chances of the Democrats in presidential elections,'' Mr. Weld said, ''and to the extent there's a huge buzz on the issue, it calls attention to the pro-life plank, which is a distinct negative in the election as a whole.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Weld said that not changing the platform made it easier for Democrats to portray the Republicans as ''a monolithic bloc'' on abortion, and hurt them in the general election.</p>
        <p>''So there's no clear way out of that box,'' Mr. Weld added.</p>
