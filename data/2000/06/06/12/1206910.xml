        <p>Hafez al-Assad has been a fixture of Syrian politics and diplomacy for so long that it is hard to imagine the Middle East without him. In 30 years of rule, he transformed Syria from a coup-prone pawn of stronger Arab states into a formidable regional power. His Soviet-equipped forces slashed across the Golan Heights and menaced Israel's survival in the early days of the 1973 war and have progressively taken over Lebanon since 1976. His fixation with reclaiming every inch of the Golan made him the last of Israel's Arab neighbors to resist a negotiated peace. His successor should shed this costly policy of confrontation and begin integrating Syria's closed and backward society into the 21st-century world.</p>
        <p>Family loyalists have moved quickly since the dictator's death Saturday to install his son and chosen heir, Bashar, as his successor, designating him as the nation's top military commander and ruling-party presidential candidate. But it is still to be seen whether the younger Assad, a Western-educated ophthalmologist with limited political experience, can master the murderous intrigues of Damascus. Israel and the United States will need to watch closely for possible changes in Syrian security policies and negotiating positions.</p>

        <p>Hafez al-Assad has been a fixture of Syrian politics and diplomacy for so long that it is hard to imagine the Middle East without him. In 30 years of rule, he transformed Syria from a coup-prone pawn of stronger Arab states into a formidable regional power. His Soviet-equipped forces slashed across the Golan Heights and menaced Israel's survival in the early days of the 1973 war and have progressively taken over Lebanon since 1976. His fixation with reclaiming every inch of the Golan made him the last of Israel's Arab neighbors to resist a negotiated peace. His successor should shed this costly policy of confrontation and begin integrating Syria's closed and backward society into the 21st-century world.</p>
        <p>Family loyalists have moved quickly since the dictator's death Saturday to install his son and chosen heir, Bashar, as his successor, designating him as the nation's top military commander and ruling-party presidential candidate. But it is still to be seen whether the younger Assad, a Western-educated ophthalmologist with limited political experience, can master the murderous intrigues of Damascus. Israel and the United States will need to watch closely for possible changes in Syrian security policies and negotiating positions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Assad maintained his tight grip through a cold-blooded instinct for power. He surrounded himself with loyal military commanders from his minority Alawite religious group and assured his domination through the competing machinations of 15 intelligence agencies. When all else failed, he did not hesitate to use violence, as in his 1982 massacre of 10,000 residents of the rebellious city of Hama.</p>
        <p>For a decade, Israeli prime ministers have tried to negotiate peace with this ruthless leader. They reasonably imagined that a deal swapping all or most of the Golan Heights for rigorous security guarantees would be easier to work out than a more complex arrangement with the Palestinians involving Jerusalem, refugees and statehood. But each time, their hopes foundered on Mr. Assad's unyielding insistence that all territory held by Syria prior to June 1967 be returned. Israel says it is ready to concede the principle of full withdrawal, but wants border adjustments to assure continued control of the Sea of Galilee, its principal freshwater source. Mr. Assad refused, most recently when he met with President Clinton in Geneva last March.</p>
        <p>No negotiating breakthrough is likely soon. But if Bashar al-Assad consolidates control, he might be able to make the deal his father could not. Re-establishing the precise June 1967 border had become a personal obsession for Hafez al-Assad. His son may have other priorities, like carefully opening up safety valves in Syria's Leninist police state and guiding its backward and isolated economy into the Internet age. Hafez al-Assad bequeathed Syria a dictator's legacy of militarism, repression and economic suffocation. His successor must offer Syrians and their neighbors something better.</p>
