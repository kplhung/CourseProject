        <p>Well, one thing didn't change: the parking valets were once more dressed in tuxedos despite the heat of the day at Belmont Park. But in most other ways, the 132nd Belmont Stakes on Saturday was staged in stunning contrast to the recent past for the third leg of the Triple Crown.</p>
        <p>Not just that the Triple Crown wasn't at stake after three straight years when it was. But chiefly because the race actually did fall apart after the two superstars of the 3-year-old class dropped out -- Fusaichi Pegasus with a small cut on his right front foot, Red Bullet because he needed rest.</p>

        <p>Well, one thing didn't change: the parking valets were once more dressed in tuxedos despite the heat of the day at Belmont Park. But in most other ways, the 132nd Belmont Stakes on Saturday was staged in stunning contrast to the recent past for the third leg of the Triple Crown.</p>
        <p>Not just that the Triple Crown wasn't at stake after three straight years when it was. But chiefly because the race actually did fall apart after the two superstars of the 3-year-old class dropped out -- Fusaichi Pegasus with a small cut on his right front foot, Red Bullet because he needed rest.</p>
        <p>So, for the first time in 30 years, they were running the Belmont without the winners of either the Kentucky Derby or the Preakness. It was as though a bunch of amateur actors were thrown onto the Broadway stage, and the marquee was at a loss for words.</p>
        <p>Make no mistake, the cast lacked distinction. None of the 11 horses had won a Grade I stakes. Only one of them, Impeachment, had run in both the Derby and the Preakness. The eventual winner, Commendable, had lost six in a row since winning his debut 10 months earlier at Del Mar, and he ran 17th in the Kentucky Derby. He was entered almost in desperation by D. Wayne Lukas, the king of Triple Crown racing, after High Yield finished 15th in the Derby and 7th in the Preakness.</p>
        <p>Commendable was no secret to the betting public, which wasn't betting on him to outrun his credentials: he was an 18-1 long shot. He also lost a shoe when it got stuck in the flooring of his paddock stall before the race.</p>
        <p>''He didn't do anything,'' Lukas said about the shoe, like any trainer reporting an insignificant matter just before the most important race of the horse's career. ''He just stood there and turned, and it held in the footing and came off real clean. The blacksmith did a good job putting it back on.''</p>
        <p>It was almost as though Pegasus, the flying horse, had clipped a wing. But losing a shoe turned out to be really insignificant for Commendable, who sprang from the gate second to the pace-setting Hugh Hefner. One mile or so later, Pat Day made his move, and Commendable threw his challenge to Hugh Hefner, who was getting tired, anyway.</p>
        <p>As they crossed the finish line, Commendable had a length and a half on Aptitude, who also ran second in the Kentucky Derby, and Aptitude had a length on Unshaded, who had to be treated with ice and cold water on the track because of heat exhaustion.</p>
        <p>They ran an exceedingly slow race, too: the mile and a half in 2:31, which was seven seconds slower than Secretariat's record time in 1973. Five years ago, Thunder Gulch won the Belmont in 2:32.</p>
        <p>But you have to go back to 1970 to find a slower going than that: 2:34 by High Echelon. The longtime trainer Jimmy Jones, who should know, has often said that time isn't important in a horse race; getting there first is what counts. Maybe he had the Belmont in his sights.</p>
        <p>On the morning after his latest coup, Lukas beamed and said: ''He's perfect. He didn't show a lot of stress from yesterday.''</p>
        <p>Commendable also didn't show a lot of speed or promise. But then, as Lukas often says, you can beat only the other horses they put on the track. And they did not include Fusaichi Pegasus or Red Bullet.</p>
        <p>Yet, despite all the snickering at the colts on stage, the 132nd Belmont drew a crowd of 67,810, a record for a day that did not feature a Triple Crown going on the line. Last year, the third straight year when it did go on the line (and the third straight time it missed), the race drew a record crowd of 85,818.</p>
        <p>The record figured to be broken until Red Bullet and Fusaichi Pegasus were withdrawn in the last three weeks. But few people would hazard a guess: without the superstars, the crowd might be as low as 40,000 or as high as 70,000, depending on the weather, the Yankees-Mets game in the Bronx, or the loss of interest with the Triple Crown factor gone.</p>
        <p>Instead, on a sultry day with the Yankees-Mets game sold out, Belmont Park hit the jackpot, the 67,810 spectators helping to set an all-sources betting handle of $54 million.</p>
        <p>How come?</p>
        <p>''We were coming off a three-year run when Triple Crown opportunities provided significant appeal,'' said Terry Meyocks, president of the New York Racing Association. ''That momentum, coupled with an outstanding lineup of quality racing, helped to provide a successful day for N.Y.R.A. and the industry.''</p>
        <p>Momentum, no doubt. Quality racing, no way, at least not in the Belmont. Now, they had better keep the momentum going until the quality racing returns.</p>
