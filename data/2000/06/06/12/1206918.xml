        <p>It had gotten so bad for Jay Payton, he was not even hitting well in batting practice. An injury to Darryl Hamilton had given him a chance to play more than he had expected, but Payton spent most of May in a tailspin after a strong start.</p>
        <p>Advice came from everywhere -- friends, players, even clubhouse attendants -- and none of it was outrageous. But all hitters are different, and much of the advice did not apply to Payton's game. He was confused as a hitter, and impatient when his 1-for-30 slide kept him out of the lineup.</p>
        <p>''It's understandable why he's been impatient,'' General Manager Steve Phillips said. ''He's been asked to be patient for an awfully long time.''</p>
        <p>Elbow and shoulder operations cost Payton most of the last four seasons, and at 27, he is finally getting his chance in the majors. His recent surge has made him a regular part of the Mets' lineup. Last night's start in center field against the Yankees was his ninth start in a row, but the game was rained out in the bottom of the third. In his eight previous games, Payton had 13 hits, including 4 home runs, in 29 at-bats (.448).</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine will make no commitment to how long Payton will stay in the lineup, but he has seen a difference in Payton's approach this month.</p>
        <p>''Jay's new in the big leagues, and it's been a while since he's really even been through a whole season,'' Valentine said. ''I think he lost a little perspective about the length of the season. He's understanding this league a little better.''</p>
        <p>Coming back after struggling is evidence of the way he has adjusted to the way pitchers attack him. Phillips noticed that Friday night against the Yankees, when Payton, who feasts on high pitches, drove a low breaking ball from Roger Clemens up the middle for a single.</p>
        <p>''I try to think a little bit more now about situations,'' Payton said. ''Earlier in the season, I think I was just going up there swinging, trying to see a pitch and hit it. Now I try to think a little more about what the pitcher might be trying to do to me. All that falls into why I've been able to have a little success lately.''</p>
        <p>Payton is also feeling better with his swing. He processed all the advice before deciding that what he needed was to simplify his swing: keep his hands back, make sure he takes his short stride.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the other parts of his game have flourished. Phillips said the Mets recently clocked Payton at 3.82 seconds from the batter's box to first base; the average for a right-handed hitter is 4.3 seconds. His speed is making an impact on defense, too.</p>
        <p>''He's been better defensively than I anticipated,'' Phillips said. ''I thought he would be a good outfielder, but he's been exceptional on defense so far. The throwing arm has been a complete nonissue. In fact, he's thrown better than a lot of center fielders in the major leagues. But he's covering more ground and getting better jumps and reads than I expected.''</p>
        <p>Ventura Makes a Splash</p>
        <p>Mike Piazza saw Robin Ventura in the tunnel during the rain delay at Yankee Stadium last night. Ventura and other Mets had been plotting a skit for the Bronx stage, and Piazza would be the target of the parody.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'If the game gets called, I'm going to do it,' '' Piazza said, quoting the Mets' third baseman.</p>
        <p>Minutes after the game was postponed, Ventura ambled out of the third-base dugout, wearing Piazza's No. 31 jersey stuffed with towels. Ventura had used eye-black to create a Piazza-style Fu Manchu, and as the rest of the Mets hung on the dugout railing, Ventura went to work.</p>
        <p>He let a phantom pitch go by, then called time, gesturing dramatically with his right hand. He took a mighty hack and sprinted around first before splashing into second. Ventura called time again and raced for home, where he slid and splashed some more.</p>
        <p>Pitching Plans Change</p>
        <p>Bobby Valentine said Mike Hampton, who threw more than 50 pitches last night, would start the second game of the Mets' two-game series with the Cubs in Chicago on Wednesday. Rick Reed will stay on schedule to start tomorrow.</p>
        <p>From Day to Night</p>
        <p>The Mets-Yankees game on Sunday, July 9, at Shea Stadium, which is scheduled for 1:10 p.m., will most likely be moved to 8:05 p.m. to be televised by ESPN.</p>
