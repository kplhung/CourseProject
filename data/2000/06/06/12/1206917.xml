        <p>In a marble corridor outside his Capitol office, Joseph L. Bruno, Republican majority leader of the State Senate, struggled to explain why the Senate was about to pass a hate crimes bill, something he and his colleagues had blocked since the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Clearly uncomfortable with the question put to him on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Bruno began by dismissing the bill as symbolism, a measure that would do nothing to fight crime, though he acknowledged its popularity.</p>
        <p>''You know, we're in a business where times change,'' he said. ''We're contemplating doing something with gun safety, and you know, three months ago, or a year ago, or three years ago, that's not anything we would contemplate. Times change, and I think we have to stay flexible.''</p>
        <p>Times do change, and no faction in New York politics has changed more of late than the Senate. The Senate Republicans, a bulwark of the state Republican machinery that has held a vise grip on that chamber for decades, look on this year's election with greater fear than they have felt since the 1970's.</p>
        <p>They see a presidential election in which most polls show Al Gore swamping George W. Bush in New York. They see an entire state, and some battleground districts, that have become more heavily Democratic in recent years. They see a voter rebellion against the Republican Party in the Republican bastion of Nassau County.</p>
        <p>And they see the Senate Democrats, long a political punching bag who often failed even to muster opponents to Republican incumbents in swing districts, fielding the strongest team of challengers in memory.</p>
        <p>In the last several months, the Senate Republicans, long a redoubt of conservatism in a liberal state, have made an astonishing march leftward, approving legislation that it would have been hard to imagine them accepting a few years ago. Each measure appealed to moderate and liberal voters in New York City and its suburbs, where the most vulnerable Republican senators are, or placated crucial interest groups like labor unions or the elderly.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, for the first time, the Senate passed a bill providing increased penalties for crimes motivated by hatred of any of several particular groups, with 24 of 36 Republicans voting in favor. Among the protected classes of victims listed in the bill are gays and lesbians, a step that Mr. Bruno and many of his colleagues had previously said they would not take.</p>
        <p>Since last fall, the Senate has passed a bill making it a crime to block access to abortion clinics, a bill creating a major new health care entitlement program for the working poor, a 55-cents-a-pack increase in the cigarette tax, a bill requiring that all cigarettes meet fire safety standards, and a bill restricting companies' ability to sell air pollution ''credits'' that in effect give polluters the right to violate clean air standards. All those bills were signed into law except the cigarette safety measure, which was vetoed.</p>
        <p>In recent budget talks, it was the Senate Republicans who championed state-subsidized prescription drugs for the elderly and an important tax credit for the poor. And with just a few days left in this year's legislative session, Senate leaders are seriously considering passing a broad package of gun controls; approving an increase in the state minimum wage to $6.75, from $5.15; and giving retired government workers automatic annual pension increases for the first time.</p>
        <p>''It's the new left-wing Senate,'' said Senator Martin Connor of Brooklyn, the Democratic minority leader. ''The mood across the aisle seems pretty grim. They're really worried about their survival, and the legislative result is they're rushing to adopt the Democratic agenda.''</p>
        <p>Republican senators have privately teased each other about their new liberal credentials.</p>
        <p>''I see them acting very nervously, and I see them making a lot of mistakes because of it,'' said Michael L. Long, chairman of the state's Conservative Party. ''In their fear and their desire to stay in control, they're acting like there's no difference between Republicans and Democrats, and passing a lot of far-left legislation.''</p>
        <p>The stakes are enormous. With Democrats firmly in control of the Assembly, a Democratic majority in the Senate could form a unified legislative front in taking on Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, over budgets and other issues. They could begin sending the governor bills on matters like an overhaul of the campaign finance laws that have been bottled up in the Senate.</p>
        <p>The Senate majority controls several hundred patronage jobs, and many of the people who hold them become campaign foot soldiers when it is time to circulate petitions, arrange rallies and get out the vote. Those jobs also provide a breeding ground for candidates for local and legislative offices.</p>
        <p>This year's elections are particularly crucial, because the next Senate will draw the district boundaries for the next decade. In a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 5 million to 3.1 million, the Republicans have maintained control of the Senate largely through the power to carve out as many favorable districts as possible for themselves. Political analysts say nonpartisan or pro-Democratic redistricting would give Democrats solid control of the chamber for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>Republicans hold a 36-to-25 edge in the Senate, and even the Democrats acknowledge that they have no better than an outside shot of picking up the six seats needed to take control. A shift in power is rare; the Assembly last changed hands in the Democrats' post-Watergate sweep of 1974, and the Senate has had a Republican majority for all but one year since 1938.</p>
        <p>But even knocking off three Republican senators could make it hard for Mr. Bruno to control legislation on which there are a few dissenters in his party. It could also persuade political contributors who now heavily favor Republicans to start hedging their bets and give to Democrats, too.</p>
        <p>The great wild card in this year's races is Nassau County, where Republicans still outnumber Democrats by a wide margin. Will voter anger last until November, and will it spill over from local contests to state races? At this point, no one can do more than guess.</p>
        <p>In a way, Mr. Pataki, a fellow Republican, has helped put the Senate Republicans on the spot, siding with legislation opposed by conservatives, rather than giving them a powerful ally in a united front. He was a major architect of the new health care program and the cigarette tax increase, and he has called for gun control and hate crimes legislation.</p>
        <p>Republicans are also worried about the loss of Rudolph W. Giuliani as their party's candidate for the United States Senate. Mr. Giuliani had been expected to fare well in New York City and its suburbs, which could have helped Republicans down the ticket, and it remains to be seen how Representative Rick A. Lazio will do as his replacement.</p>
        <p>Publicly, the Senate Republicans say that this year's legislative agenda has nothing to do with politics, and that they are not worried about November. ''What people should read into this is that the Senate majority represents the thinking of mainstream New Yorkers,'' said Senator Nicholas A. Spano of Yonkers, who is widely seen as one of the most vulnerable. ''We have a history of being moderate, and our passage of bills like clinic access and hate crimes are evidence of that.''</p>
        <p>But privately, Republican senators admit that many of their brethren are running scared, and that that is driving the decisions to pass bills, a circumstance that has some upstate conservatives with secure seats none too happy. ''Bruno is a thorough pragmatist,'' a Republican senator said. ''He's doing what's needed, and he's having to fight some of his own people to do it.''</p>
