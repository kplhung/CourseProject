        <p>This is a 60-second commercial that Representative Rick A. Lazio has begun showing in the eight major upstate television markets. It is the first advertisement produced by his Senate campaign staff. Called ''Introduction,'' the ad emphasizes his New York roots and middle-class upbringing.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome Agency of Falls Church, Va.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN The ad opens with black-and-white pictures of Mr. Lazio's parents as he tells the story of their early struggle to make ends meet. Mr. Lazio then speaks of meeting his wife, raising two children and working his way up the political ladder from a job in the Suffolk County prosecutor's office to congressman. Twice Mr. Lazio is shown walking on a beach with his family. The ad's final images show Mr. Lazio at campaign rallies and greeting supporters on an upstate bus tour.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT ''My mom and dad were both veterans. Their very first date was at a Brooklyn Dodgers game at Ebbets Field. My dad was one of those guys who came back from World War II without a dime in his pocket, but he had this dream, his very own auto parts store. I worked there as a kid stacking mufflers and learning all about hard work from my dad,'' Mr. Lazio says.</p>
        <p>''I started as a prosecutor and I have been a congressman for eight years. I work hard on issues like housing and the environment, and with two daughters in public schools, I care deeply about education. I've got a mainstream record and I've stood up for New York.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY Mr. Lazio was born in West Islip and now lives in Brightwaters, both in Suffolk County. He often trumpets legislation he sponsored that led to  changes in public housing policy, with a primary goal of increasing the number of tenants who work. Mr. Lazio has received favorable ratings from environmental groups, though he has also been criticized for voting for federal budgets that eliminated some programs. On education, Mr. Lazio supported legislation last year that gives local districts more latitude in spending federal money. But Democrats note that Mr. Lazio supported a 1995 budget bill that included a provision eliminating the Education Department.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD The ad's homespun biographical narrative is meant to introduce the relatively unknown congressman to crucial upstate voters while forging a comfortable, middle-of-the-road image. The scenes of Long Island and family pictures tie in with Mr. Lazio's repeated references to his New York roots; his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, moved to the state five months ago. The emphasis on family illustrates a a distinction between Mr. Lazio's personal life and the public marital difficulties of Mrs. Clinton and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p>
