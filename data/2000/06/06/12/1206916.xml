        <p>An hour earlier, Commissioner Gary Bettman had handed the Stanley Cup to the Devils, winners over the Dallas Stars in two overtime periods.</p>
        <p>Now Martin Brodeur had plunged into a chair in front of his locker in the visitors' dressing room and had taken a deep breath. He had a victory cigar in his left hand and his right arm wrapped around his wife, Melanie.</p>
        <p>The goaltender whom some call the franchise had won a Stanley Cup to go with the one the team captured in 1995.</p>
        <p>''There were some bumps along the way, but I'm so happy it's over and I'm glad we're on the good side of it,'' Brodeur said. ''It was a great feeling that it took us five years to get back to where we were supposed to be. Winning the cup every five years is not so bad.''</p>
        <p>Except for a few uninspiring moments, Brodeur was simply brilliant in the playoffs, especially in the finals against Dallas.</p>
        <p>Some thought that Brodeur, along with Jason Arnott, was as deserving of the Conn Smythe trophy, which goes to the most valuable player in the tournament, as Scott Stevens, the winner.</p>
        <p>Brodeur was so brilliant in the last four games -- the last two in overtime -- against Dallas that he allowed only four goals while facing 112 shots. His goaltending duel with Ed Belfour in Game 5, which went into triple overtime, will go down as one of the best in the tournament.</p>
        <p>With his 16 victories in the Stanley Cup playoffs, Brodeur tied the record Philadelphia's Bernie Parent set in 1973-74 for most victories in a season with 59. He was almost as happy about that accomplishment as winning the Stanley Cup.</p>
        <p>''That is a statistic I will treasure,'' Brodeur said. ''You've got to play a lot of games. It took me a lot of games to get to that and number, and I'm glad it's over.''</p>
        <p>Brodeur played 72 games in the regular season, winning 43. He played every minute in 23 playoff games and got his 16th victory with a brilliant performance in Game 6. He also erased the stigma of having previously lost all of his overtime playoff games.</p>
        <p>''It's a good thing I didn't see it,'' Brodeur said of his 0-7 record, which was often flashed on television screens. ''I knew about it, though, and I wanted to get it over with. This is a great way to end it, by winning the Stanley Cup.''</p>
        <p>Lamoriello Quiet on Future</p>
        <p>Lou Lamoriello, the Devils' president and general manager, refused to answer specific questions about his future with the team, which has been sold by John McMullen to YankeeNets for $175 million -- plus a  $1 million bonus for winning the cup -- but he made it clear he would stay with the team through the entry draft later this month.</p>
        <p>The YankeeNets will officially take over the team on July 12 and that group has expressed willingness to keep Lamoriello.</p>
        <p>He said he had not decided which names would appear on the Stanley Cup. He did say that Robbie Ftorek, who was replaced as coach with eight games left in the regular season, was part of the team and deserved some praise.</p>
        <p>No Decision on Parade</p>
        <p>The Devils' Lou Lamoriello said the team had not decided how, when or where the public Stanley Cup celebration would take place. Lamoriello said the decision had been delayed because he had not discussed the details with John McMullen, the team owner. Because of a bad back, McMullen did not go to Dallas.</p>
        <p>Early Ratings Report</p>
        <p>The Devils' clinching of the Stanley Cup on ABC Saturday night produced a 5.2 preliminary overnight Nielsen rating.</p>
        <p>The final national rating will probably be lower because the overnight measures only 48 major markets. Game 5's original 5.3 rating Thursday night was revised to a 4.2 when the ratings from the rest of the country were calculated.</p>
        <p>From 8 to 11 p.m. Saturday, the game rated a 4.5, but rose to a 6.6 from 11 p.m. to 12:45 a.m.</p>
        <p>The New York market rated a 7.0, equaling 476,877 television households. In Dallas, the 28.7 rating equals 562,428 households.</p>
