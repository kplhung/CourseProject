        <p>If a group of grandmothers from Atlanta were running the Internet, there would be no chat rooms and absolutely no government involvement. And they would enlist William H. Gates, the church and the United Nations to help them oversee the global network.</p>
        <p>College students, on the other hand, want the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the Internal Revenue Service involved, since, as they see it, ''these people pretty much run who we are.''</p>
        <p>One woman from Nebraska suggested that Oprah Winfrey would make a good Internet watchdog. The candid and sometimes contradictory opinions were offered in focus groups held around the country the last two weeks as the Markle Foundation began taking what may be the first comprehensive look at public attitudes about the Internet, its regulation and governance and online privacy and fraud.</p>
        <p>The results from the 10 two-hour sessions, with groups of six to eight people, offered only preliminary insights and were mainly intended to help the researchers narrow their focus and redefine their questions before beginning more in-depth surveys.</p>
        <p>The sessions were perhaps most significant in underscoring the complex and tough task facing policy makers around the world as they seek to govern the Internet.</p>
        <p>Participants seemed to trust business over government to regulate the Internet. On privacy and fraud, they echoed the call of buyer beware. When pressed, however, most seemed to expect some type of rules or protections. And few knew anything about  consumer-protection programs implemented by Internet companies or about a new international body that administers the Internet's system of domain names.</p>
        <p>Zoe Baird, president of the New York-based foundation, a nonprofit organization, said the goal of the six-month survey and follow-up research was to dig beyond public opinion polls to see how people really feel about and act on the Internet.</p>
        <p>''We are trying to conduct a test to figure out if what people are saying is in response to what they have read and heard or what they really do,'' Ms. Baird said.</p>
        <p>The final report, to be issued in September, is intended both to engage the public in Internet policy discussion and to provide a basis for lawmakers and companies to develop intelligent, long-term policies.</p>
        <p>''As these focus groups are beginning to show, these are very complicated issues,'' Ms. Baird said. ''We hope this will help in developing and understanding what policies are sustainable.''</p>
        <p>The research is being done with Greenberg Quinlan Research, a Washington public policy research firm. To begin the study, focus groups were held recently in Omaha, Atlanta, Scottsdale, Ariz., and Syosset, N.Y. Participants included adults between 18 and 75, split between Internet users and nonusers.</p>
        <p>Because the focus group participants were promised anonymity, the foundation provided only first names and ages of participants.</p>
        <p>Stanley Greenberg, who is leading the research, said he was struck by the shift in attitudes about whether government should try to regulate the network. In a study he did two years ago for the Direct Marketing Association, he said, people were more inclined to want government to try to regulate things like pornography.</p>
        <p>''People didn't understand the Internet as well,'' he said. ''They understand more now about the difficulty of regulation.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, even older people who have never used the Internet seemed hesitant over the prospect of new laws.</p>
        <p>''So far, it's the one thing that government doesn't control,'' said Evaughn, a 69-year-old retired federal worker from Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Still, she and others in her group thought there should be some rules. Evaughn even brought in an e-mail message from someone she knew that discussed the case of a young girl who had been lured by an online sexual predator.</p>
        <p>''There's no reason for anybody to be in chat rooms,'' she added, saying they were dangerous.</p>
        <p>The questions and exercises in the focus groups tried to explore participants' attitudes about online privacy and to get a sense of what kind of groups they would want running the global network.</p>
        <p>Although initially most people said they were hesitant about having government involved, many seemed to think that the Federal Trade Commission's recent request to Congress to pass basic rules for how companies handle personal information collected online had some merit.</p>
        <p>''I think you have the right to know where your stuff is going,'' said Kristin, an 18-year-old restaurant worker in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Most participants said they were very leery of giving away personal information. But during simulations, few seemed to recognize the seal of a popular program called TrustE, begun by the industry to certify sites that comply with basic privacy standards. And most acknowledged that they never read the privacy policies posted by Web sites.</p>
        <p>During a discussion about information that companies have compiled on people on the Internet and elsewhere, Donna, a 21-year-old nurse from Long Island, said, ''Everybody can find anything, so forget about it -- we should all just crawl in a shell.''</p>
        <p>Regardless, she said she still shops online.</p>
        <p>''Maybe I should just stop giving stuff out on the Internet, but it's so convenient,'' she said with a shrug.</p>
        <p>On the topic of Internet regulation, only one person had heard of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, a nonprofit group appointed by the Clinton administration to oversee the administrative functions of the Internet and set rules for its addressing systems.</p>
        <p>Though when asked what kind of group they would appoint to run the network, most called for a group similar to that Icann is trying to put together -- one that is international and run by Internet companies and individual users.</p>
        <p>And in nearly every focus group, a top choice to be part of that board was Mr. Gates, the Microsoft chairman.</p>
        <p>Although most groups said the United Nations should be involved, few wanted any other government representation. But many of the older women thought the church or a theologian should be involved, ''someone with morals.''</p>
        <p>''I think we should put Oprah on there,'' added one middle-aged woman in Omaha. ''She has a lot of pull. She'd be pulling for all of us. She has a loud voice with good morals. She's always for the underdog.''</p>
