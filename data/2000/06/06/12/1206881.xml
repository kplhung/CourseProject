        <p>Six fifth graders here at the highly regarded Potomac Elementary School, suspicious about the way their state achievement tests were administered last month, complained at home about some odd things they had noticed.</p>
        <p>Their comments led to the resignation of the school principal, the suspension of a teacher and the discovery of what officials have described as substantial evidence of administrative cheating on a test that lends ranking and, inevitably, cachet to the best schools in Maryland.</p>
        <p>The test incident has pushed Potomac Elementary, one of the highest rated schools in the affluent, competitive cities around Washington, into the national debate about whether standardization tests, driven by the demands of politicians and parents for firmer evidence of school improvement, risk skewing education as much as helping it.</p>
        <p>The Potomac setting differs from most similar incidents because the school already was in the upper echelon of achievement even as supervisors pressed students to do better.</p>
        <p>''These tests were never designed for setting real estate values or for politicians to use as a way to lever their campaigns,'' said Dr. Jerry D. Weast, the superintendent of the Montgomery County school system, which is investigating Potomac Elementary.</p>
        <p>Dr. Weast called for a better understanding that the new standardized tests, which are being increasingly used across the country, are a needed but limited tool for curriculum and quality control, one that can be abused by the simplistic ''public display'' of relative rankings.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, school ratings remain as feverishly consulted as tax tables by house buyers looking for strong schools that can put their children on the path to prestigious universities and high-paying careers. The current presidential campaign resonates daily with fresh promises of tougher education standards for children.</p>
        <p>Other cheating problems have been reported recently in New York City, where 32 schools and dozens of teachers are under investigation, and in Houston and 10 other districts in Texas, where there have been reports of patterns of extraordinary erasures and corrective editing on tests.</p>
        <p>Officials at the highly regarded schools in nearby Fairfax County, Virginia, another Washington suburb, are looking into charges of improper coaching by a teacher at a middle school.</p>
        <p>Another school, Eastgate Elementary in Columbus, Ohio, was hit with a cheating scandal in the fourth grade a few weeks after President Clinton visited to showcase its progress in meeting standards.</p>
        <p>Critics of achievement testing contend that Potomac and similar scandals suggest that basic education is being subsumed by a process of relentless testing and ranking of schools based on material values that veer far from scholarship.</p>
        <p>''Schools are turning into test coaching centers, caught up in this frenzy of trying to look their best,'' said Monty Neill, director of FairTest, a private education group in Boston opposed to SAT's and other standardized exams. Mr. Neill maintains that these exams undermine, not bolster, the quality of education in a process that invites cheating.</p>
        <p>''There's no way to tell how much cheating there actually is, but I get the sense nobody is looking too hard for abuses,'' he said of the push by  school districts to demonstrate achievement.</p>
        <p>Maryland education officials said that the Potomac incident is an aberration in such an affluent district and that the tests, one of the early drives for credible statewide school standards, have been well policed.</p>
        <p>Since the tests were introduced in 1991, there have been perhaps five or six complaints a year in the state's 1,400 schools, officials said.</p>
        <p>''I do feel we have politicized education too much,'' said the education superintendent of Maryland, Nancy S. Grasmick, while defending the testing as a responsible means for educators to target problems and tailor remedies.</p>
        <p>''The political part of education today does not offer stability,'' Ms. Grasmick warned, finding too many candidates offering ''silver bullet'' panaceas for difficult classroom problems.</p>
        <p>Dr. Weast conceded that Potomac Elementary, ranked first in the prized Montgomery County system and third in the state, ''has become a poster child for the testing debate.'' But he emphasized that the incident, while alarming and deserving investigation, involves only one or two professionals at a single school in a system of 9,500 teachers and 189 schools.</p>
        <p>Even so, the incident is confronting parents and professionals here with the question of how to best to govern the competitive pressures that modern education puts on teachers and students.</p>
        <p>''It's out of balance,'' said Janyce Speier, one of the leaders of the Potomac Parent Teachers Association. ''I find teachers are frustrated with the amount of time they spend on testing and would rather be with their kids doing other things. I salute accountability, but maybe you can push that envelope too far.''</p>
        <p>The issue has sparked concern that ''the battle for performance dollars between schools finally may have taken their toll,'' as one resident wrote to The Montgomery Journal. Another complained in the newspaper that as schools compete through the state's testing of their students ''the value of their parents' property is tied to the outcome.''</p>
        <p>After the parents alerted state officials about their children's testing suspicions, the Potomac principal, Dr. Karen B. Karch, resigned in the face of accusations that she improperly allowed students extra time and coached them to change incorrect answers on the School Assessment Performance Program. The program is a rigorous examination in which third graders and fifth graders are tested across parts of five days to produce a composite understanding of where a school stands in meeting state standards.</p>
        <p>For all its record of excellence, Potomac Elementary had been criticized earlier by district supervisors as failing to meet its potential in some areas. The critique is resented in retrospect by some parents who feel it needlessly compounded the competitive pressures. But district officials say it was fair comment given the community's high expectations and the school's outstanding reputation in pioneering such programs as an immersion course in Mandarin Chinese.</p>
        <p>''My resignation is not an admission of guilt,'' Dr. Karch, a professional for 30 years, said in a statement. ''I exercised poor judgment in some of my decisions,'' she said while declining to answer questions in ''a situation that is already out of control.''</p>
        <p>A great deal more than prestige can be riding on the results of the test competition among schools, from salary rewards to school favoritism, said Bob Chase, president of the National Education Association, the largest teachers union in the country with 2.5 million members.</p>
        <p>''If a school doesn't get to a certain point in the tests the financial rewards might not be there,'' Mr. Chase said, describing the resultant pressures on teachers and administrators as unfair.</p>
        <p>''Potomac is not alone in this,'' he said. ''The cheating allegations  point to a bigger issue, to make sure the use and overuse of testing does not negatively impact something positive like the standards movement.''</p>
        <p>While awaiting the results of the inquiry, the community here has rallied round its school.</p>
        <p>Parents had organized a vote of confidence for the school staff by having all 634 students bring bouquets to class.</p>
        <p>''Well, at least it's encouraging that character building is working at Potomac,'' said a beleaguered parent in praise of the students who decided they had to speak up.</p>
