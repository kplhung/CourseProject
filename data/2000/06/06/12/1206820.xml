        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Is it not possible that Jon S. Corzine swamped former Gov. Jim Florio in the race for the New Jersey Democratic primary for the Senate (front page, June 7) because he spoke to the issues that trouble most Americans?</p>
        <p>We are constantly subjected to overwrought threats of nuclear disaster and anthrax attacks, and expressions of a need for more military spending by politicians who pay only lip service to our real worries --  health care, education, humanitarian needs.</p>

        <p>Is it not possible that Jon S. Corzine swamped former Gov. Jim Florio in the race for the New Jersey Democratic primary for the Senate (front page, June 7) because he spoke to the issues that trouble most Americans?</p>
        <p>We are constantly subjected to overwrought threats of nuclear disaster and anthrax attacks, and expressions of a need for more military spending by politicians who pay only lip service to our real worries --  health care, education, humanitarian needs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine addressed these worries in a way rarely seen from politicians today. Perhaps his victory should be taken as a warning that the American people are fed up with politics, as they have been for three decades.</p>
