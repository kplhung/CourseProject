        <p>Politicians and protesters vied for attention yesterday at the National Puerto Rican Day Parade. But there was no mistaking what drew the hundreds of thousands who jammed the sidewalks for a 42-block stretch of Fifth Avenue: a chance to be part of a high-spirited celebration of Puerto Rican culture, music and ethnic pride.</p>
        <p>Though the parade itself went off without incident, hundreds of bystanders were overcome by the heat, and the celebration's aftermath was marred by violence. Three men were stabbed near the end of the parade route, the police said yesterday, in unrelated attacks in a 20-minute span beginning shortly after 5 p.m. All three were hospitalized in stable condition last night.</p>

        <p>Politicians and protesters vied for attention yesterday at the National Puerto Rican Day Parade. But there was no mistaking what drew the hundreds of thousands who jammed the sidewalks for a 42-block stretch of Fifth Avenue: a chance to be part of a high-spirited celebration of Puerto Rican culture, music and ethnic pride.</p>
        <p>Though the parade itself went off without incident, hundreds of bystanders were overcome by the heat, and the celebration's aftermath was marred by violence. Three men were stabbed near the end of the parade route, the police said yesterday, in unrelated attacks in a 20-minute span beginning shortly after 5 p.m. All three were hospitalized in stable condition last night.</p>
        <p>It was an unfortunate coda to an otherwise upbeat parade, traditionally one of the city's largest and most boisterous. The celebration turned the Upper East Side into a undulating sea of red, white and blue Puerto Rican flags displayed on T-shirts, bandannas, nail polish, necklaces and even a cape worn by a dog.</p>
        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio, New York's candidates for the United States Senate, were there, along with a long list of other state and local politicians. Hundreds of marchers and spectators held signs urging the United States Navy to stop using Vieques, a Puerto Rican island, as a bombing range.</p>
        <p>Still others at the parade, which choked traffic from Midtown  through the Upper East Side, rallied in memory of Pedro Albizu Campos, a figure in Puerto Rico's separatist movement who called for islanders to start an armed struggle against the United States.</p>
        <p>But it was the dancers, the competing salsa and marching bands and the floats sponsored by towns and villages from Puerto Rico that drew the biggest roars from the crowds. So, too, did the tributes to Tito Puente, the jazz musician of Puerto Rican heritage who died on May 31.</p>
        <p>''It's about Puerto Rican people being together, proud of being Puerto Rican and celebrating our day,'' said Violet Colon, 49, from the Bronx.</p>
        <p>But the sun that beat down on Fifth Avenue proved too much for many paradegoers. As temperatures reached the low 90's, about 250 people were treated for heat-related health problems, mostly sunstroke and dehydration, Firefighter Vito Berretta said. While several were taken to hospitals, no cases were serious, he said.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani marched alongside Mr. Lazio, who replaced him last month as the Republican candidate for the Senate. Mrs. Clinton was escorted by Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, with whom she broke into a dance at one point, as the two passed a 12-member salsa band.</p>
        <p>The previous Sunday, Mrs. Clinton  was jeered and booed intensely as she marched up Fifth Avenue in the Salute to Israel Parade, in part because of her previous support for an independent Palestinian state. But yesterday, it was Mr. Giuliani who drew a symphony of boos and occasional rude gestures, evidence of his decline in popularity among the city's Hispanic population since first being elected mayor in 1993, particularly after a series of recent police shootings of unarmed men.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani seemed impervious to the often bitter response, rushing to the sidewalks to greet spectators even when he was being booed. ''It was a better reception than I usually get,'' said Mr. Giuliani, alluding to the heckling he had received at recent Puerto Rican Day parades. ''I think it is wonderful. I think more people applauded for me.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton clearly relished the turnaround that a week had brought.</p>
        <p>''That is democracy in action,'' she said of the reversal from the previous Sunday. ''We are so blessed to live in a country where everyone is free to express their opinion.''</p>
        <p>The parade -- which at times seemed to extend throughout much of Manhattan, with streams of cars and motorcycles festooned with Puerto Rican flags -- illustrated the growing economic force of Latinos in the United States economy.</p>
        <p>There were, of course, floats sponsored by traditional Latino-oriented products, like Cafe Bustelo coffee and Corona, the Mexican beer. But the Showtime cable network was promoting its new television series ''Resurrection Blvd.'', about a Latino family in East Los Angeles. There were also floats by several Latino-oriented Internet sites, like Latino.com and LaMusica.com, as well as by retailers and companies like Sears and Colgate-Palmolive.</p>
        <p>The Mazola corn oil float feverishly rocked back and forth to the tunes of the Barrio Boyzz, who had the young girls in the crowd swooning. The actors Jimmy Smits and Rosie Perez also drew intense cheers, as did the boxer Felix Trinidad.</p>
        <p>The parade was dedicated to Vieques and to Pedro Albizu Campos, the onetime leader of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party who was imprisoned in the 1930's and 40's for trying to overthrow the United States  government and again in the 50's for attacks against the government. But the concern about Vieques drew more attention.</p>
        <p>''We are being invaded,'' said Brinitte Gonzalez, 30, of the Bronx, one of many who held a ''Peace for Vieques'' sign. ''It is our island. I just want them to get out.''</p>
        <p>Yet even some of the demonstrators acknowledged that the expression of ethnic pride and celebration of Puerto Rican culture were what most drew them to the parade.</p>
