        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Jeff Greenfield's pointed humor (Op-Ed, June 6) mistakes brevity for informality. In this folksy political climate, some candidates enlist the former to convey the latter, hoping to reassure the public that they're just like us.</p>
        <p>The public, though, having recently lived through a most informal approach to adult and presidential responsibility, appears to have made candor, self-acceptance and self-confidence -- three elements of real maturity -- a key part of its election criteria.</p>
        <p>STANLEY RENSHON  New York, June 6, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a professor of political science at CUNY and a psychoanalyst.</p>
