        <p>After 38 starts at 20 tracks in six countries and three races in three weeks, Running Stag probably had to stop running sometime. And he did stop yesterday when Lemon Drop Kid rallied to win the 112th Brooklyn Handicap by seven and a quarter lengths in the heat of Belmont Park.</p>
        <p>Lemon Drop Kid, who won the Belmont Stakes and the Travers last year, was second to Running Stag, the favorite, in the early stages and then took the lead in the homestretch while Running Stag faded to sixth. In a crowded photo for second, Lager edged Down the Aisle by a head.</p>
