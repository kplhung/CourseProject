        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Justices Deny Grandparents Visiting Rights'' (front page, June 6): The Supreme Court's decision acknowledges that assumptions of parental autonomy based on the single nuclear family cannot be taken for granted. Divorce, decisions not to marry, single-parent households and the like have created more varied family structures than before.</p>
        <p>It is a disservice to the children of this country to ignore their perception of what family is to them.</p>

        <p>It is a disservice to the children of this country to ignore their perception of what family is to them.</p>
        <p>A woman who divorces her husband, or the mother of children whose father has died, may no longer be related to her children's paternal grandparents, but the children still have a connection to them through heritage and bloodlines. They are family to that child.</p>
