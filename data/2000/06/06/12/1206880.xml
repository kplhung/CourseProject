        <p>And for their next magic act, the Yankees will resurrect Dwight Gooden and turn him into a major league pitcher again.</p>
        <p>Gooden, George Steinbrenner's latest reclamation project, has signed a minor league contract to continue playing baseball after the Houston Astros sent him to Tampa Bay this season and the Devil Rays released him.</p>
        <p>Some players would take the hint and find another means of employment or recreation. Gooden, however, is convinced he can still pitch.</p>
        <p>''I guess Doc feels he can still do it, especially the way pitching is now in baseball,'' John Franco, the Mets' relief pitcher and a former teammate, said yesterday. ''It's so scarce and not so good. Can't be any worse than what's out there already.''</p>
        <p>Franco spoke before the Mets and the Yankees concluded the Bronx half of their interleague and intracity competition. Gooden played for both teams, starring for the Mets, pitching creditably at times for the Yankees. The Mets didn't see any reason to prolong his career. The Yankees' owner is always ready to give a guy another chance, a last chance.</p>
        <p>As deftly as he locates his pitches on a good day, Franco put his finger precisely on why the Dwight Goodens are dragged off baseball's scrap heap and tossed back into the arena like so many ancient gladiators. Baseball is suffering from so serious a pitching shortage that teams will try anything and anyone. It used to be that left-handed pitchers were the ones who seemed to have a lifetime guarantee of a job in the major leagues. Now right-handers are getting their share of jobs because of the desperate need that teams have for pitching.</p>
        <p>By signing Gooden to a minor league contract, the Yankees don't really risk anything. He can take classes at their Tampa complex, then undergo tests in minor league games. There they can experiment with him pitching out of the bullpen, an experience that he basically has avoided in his 16-year career, relieving only seven times in his 412-game career.</p>
        <p>''That's a question that maybe we'll answer, either in Tampa or Columbus,'' Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, said. ''I'm not sure. Just looking at it from my standpoint, I think it would be worthwhile finding out.''</p>
        <p>It's what Gooden can do at all that is in serious question. Both the Astros and the Devil Rays are managed by former pitchers, one who also served as pitching coach for the 1997 World Series champion Florida Marlins. If Larry Dierker and Larry Rothschild thought Gooden could still pitch effectively in the major leagues, he would not be taking remedial courses in Tampa.</p>
        <p>''What I saw was average stuff,'' Dierker said yesterday from San Diego, ''the kind of stuff if you're going to pitch at the major league level, you have to have good control. You see guys like Bob Tewksbury not throwing real hard and not having great sinking action but placing the ball where they want it and having good off-speed stuff. If he gets to the point where he has that kind of command, he can be successful.''</p>
        <p>With the Devil Rays, said a member of their organization, Gooden was not the ''same pitcher that everyone remembers.'' But then, he hasn't been since very early in the 1990's with the Mets.</p>
        <p>''He had a good breaking ball; his slider had really improved,'' the Tampa Bay employee said. ''But he lost power off his hard curveball and that made his fastball less effective. He just couldn't get away with any mistakes. The home runs were pretty pronounced.''</p>
        <p>Gooden gave up 15 home runs in 40 2/3 innings with the two teams, including 9 in his last 15 2/3 innings for the Devil Rays. The Yankees clubbed three home runs against him in four and one-third innings last month.</p>
        <p>''He made mistakes and we got him for a couple three-run homers,'' Stottlemyre said. ''But it looks like he still has something in his arm.''</p>
        <p>Gooden allowed 17.5 base runners per nine innings in nine starts with the Astros and the Devil Rays and emerged with a career-high 6.86 earned run average. Opposing teams battered him for a .319 batting average and a .645 slugging percentage. If the 35-year-old right-hander doesn't make it back to the majors with the benevolent Yankees or any other team grasping onto the nearest experienced arm, those will be the final figures on his year-by-year record.</p>
        <p>Are players embarrassed by such performances, or can they shrug them off as simply having a few bad games that a little more work would overcome?</p>
        <p>''There's a time and a place for a player at a certain age to step back and say, 'Hey, I've had enough and that's it,' '' Franco said. ''But it's hard to walk away when you're so used to doing something for 12, 15 years. Sometimes it might take an embarrassment to say, 'I've had enough.' ''</p>
        <p>He wasn't passing judgment on Gooden or commenting on his desire to continue pitching, just explaining the way a player in Gooden's circumstance thinks and acts. What Franco didn't say was that often the player is the last one to know he is finished. These days, on the other hand, teams don't always know it either.</p>
        <p>Talking about the possibility of sending Gooden to the minors when he was with the Astros, Dierker said: ''I don't think we could have gotten him to the minor leagues. With the pitching shortage that exists, we probably would have put him on release waivers and somebody would have claimed him.''</p>
