        <p>Congress is expected to pass legislation this week that would make electronic signatures and records as legally binding as pen-and-paper versions. Passage would end a long stalemate over how far a law should go in freeing financial institutions from current consumer notification laws.</p>
        <p>The compromise bill, approved by a House-Senate conference committee late last week, would confirm that electronic signatures and electronic records were legal. It would also provide a way for banks and insurers to notify consumers of late payments or changes in credit card or loan contracts via e-mail rather than postal mail, and it would allow financial institutions to begin keeping more records electronically.</p>

It would also provide a way for banks and insurers to notify consumers of late payments or changes in credit card or loan contracts via e-mail rather than postal mail, and it would allow financial institutions to begin keeping more records electronically.</p>
        <p>The legislation incorporates a measure sought by the Clinton administration, requiring a company to conduct a test e-mailing with customers before sending any subsequent e-mail notifications. ''This is good news for both the Internet economy and American consumers,'' Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., Republican of Virginia and chairman of the House Commerce Committee, said.</p>
