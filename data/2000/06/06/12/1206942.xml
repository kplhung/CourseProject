        <p>Four young women were sexually abused and robbed in and around the south end of Central Park yesterday in a series of attacks by a gang of about 15 men, the police said.</p>
        <p>Two men were arrested in connection with the attacks, said Detective John Giammarino, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>The young women were treated at city hospitals.</p>
        <p>It was not immediately clear what was done to them, but ''sexual abuse,'' the least serious category of sex crime, usually involves groping someone without the person's consent. Detective Giammarino said that at least two of the women had their clothes partly or completely ripped off.</p>
        <p>In the first incident, at 6:15 p.m., the gang attacked two teenagers, 16 and 18, at Central Park South and Avenue of the Americas, Detective Giammarino said.</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, inside the park at 63rd Street and East Drive, the gang set upon a 28-year-old woman and a 29-year-old man,the detective said.</p>
        <p>One woman who manages a bar on Central Park South said she saw a woman who appeared to be in her late 20's, naked and crying, being escorted out of the park by a man, led through a throng of people leaving the National Puerto Rican Day Parade, and put in a police vehicle.</p>
        <p>''We couldn't believe what was happening,'' said the manager, Rita  Berlin, 26. ''We thought, 'Is she kidding?' And then we realized she was crying and screaming. It was really disturbing.''</p>
        <p>The attacks had no connection to the parade, Detective Giammarino said.</p>
        <p>The last attack occurred at 6:45 p.m., when an 18-year-old woman was sexually abused at 59th Street and Center Drive North, the police said.</p>
        <p>The two men arrested were Tremayne Bane, 23, of Miami Beach, Fla., and David Row, 24, of Hempstead, N.Y., Detective Giammarino said. Both were charged with felony sexual abuse and robbery. It was not clear what was taken in the robberies. The police are looking for the other suspects.</p>
