        <p>With 1.1 million students spread across 1,100 buildings, New York City's public schools have historically contained some of the best and worst schools in the country. The problem is finding a way to extend teacher talent and enthusiasm for learning beyond those schools that have traditionally flourished to schools at the low end of the performance scale. The system has a long way to go to reach this goal. But as the school year draws to a close, New York City's schools are showing indisputable signs of improvement as measured by state and local reading tests.</p>
        <p>To solidify and build upon these gains, the city and the state will need to commit more energy and money to two vital objectives. The first is attracting the most talented teachers into the lowest-performing schools. The second is to build more schools as quickly as possible, to alleviate poor conditions and overcrowding that typically make the best teachers go elsewhere. The school system will also need to assure that funds are directed to teacher training and other instructional needs instead of to administrative activities that have less to do with improving academic performance.</p>

        <p>With 1.1 million students spread across 1,100 buildings, New York City's public schools have historically contained some of the best and worst schools in the country. The problem is finding a way to extend teacher talent and enthusiasm for learning beyond those schools that have traditionally flourished to schools at the low end of the performance scale. The system has a long way to go to reach this goal. But as the school year draws to a close, New York City's schools are showing indisputable signs of improvement as measured by state and local reading tests.</p>
        <p>To solidify and build upon these gains, the city and the state will need to commit more energy and money to two vital objectives. The first is attracting the most talented teachers into the lowest-performing schools. The second is to build more schools as quickly as possible, to alleviate poor conditions and overcrowding that typically make the best teachers go elsewhere. The school system will also need to assure that funds are directed to teacher training and other instructional needs instead of to administrative activities that have less to do with improving academic performance.</p>
        <p>This school year got off to a chaotic start, with  the system roiled by uncertainty over whether then-Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew would stay or go.  The Board of Education finally voted to buy out his contract and seek a replacement. Then the search for a successor turned into a political slugfest, as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani worked to undermine the prime candidate, Harold Levy, on the grounds that Mr. Levy was too close to the teachers' union. The board's willingness to appoint him over Mr. Giuliani's objections came as a relief to New Yorkers who had grown tired of political brinkmanship at the expense of the city's schools. Mr. Levy got the permanent job after impressing the board during his stint in the interim post. He pushed the State Legislature for a bigger share of state aid, started a review of the system's huge bureaucracy and began to streamline the disciplinary procedures through which incompetent teachers are removed.</p>
        <p>As for student performance, Mr. Levy is reaping the results of four years of intensive work by Dr. Crew, who devoted himself to high standards and championed the belief that all the system's children can learn. This gospel of high achievement allowed the system to boost reading scores slightly for three consecutive years. But the system posted the largest gains yet just recently, when both state and local reading scores showed significant improvements all over the city, even in some of the most troubled districts. To a large extent, these improvements are attributed to Project Read, an intensive program that provides children with small-group instruction after school or during the day.</p>
        <p>Though encouraging, the most recent test scores show a clear division between middle-class neighborhoods, which are improving quickly, and poor neighborhoods, which are improving at a slower rate. It is no secret that schools in the poorest neighborhoods suffer the worst overcrowding and are staffed by the least experienced teachers. In addition, recent surveys show that the most talented teachers are the first to leave for the suburbs, citing not just higher pay, but also the need for relief from huge and unwieldy classes. Stopgap solutions are imposing an educational cost. In Queens, for example, the city has eased overcrowding by running two split sessions that cheat students of one or two class periods per day.</p>
        <p>The State Legislature has wisely committed itself to provide incentives that could lure more experienced teachers to low-performing schools and keep them there. But the class-size problem will remain insoluble until more money is found to build some badly needed schools.</p>
