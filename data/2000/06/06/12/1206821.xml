        <p>You have heard of ambulance-chasing lawyers. How about auditors you can sic on late delivery vans.</p>
        <p>For a monthly fee of $9.95, a new Web service will track the status of a customer's FedEx and United Parcel Service shipments, alerting the sender whenever a package arrives later than the time guaranteed by the delivery company.</p>
        <p>Once alerted, the shipper can then use that information to demand that the delivery service fulfill its on-time guarantee by paying a full refund for the cost of shipping the package, which typically ranges from $10 to $20.</p>
        <p>The new service, OnTimeAuditor.com, is aimed at businesses that send large volumes of packages, typically more than they could track manually, said Robert Morse, the auditing company's vice president for  marketing and its co-founder.</p>
        <p>Of the 16 million packages that FedEx and U.P.S. ship each day, more than 5 percent -- some 800,000 -- arrive late, Mr. Morse said, citing industry estimates. Assuming about $12 a package, that would be $10 million a day in unclaimed refunds.</p>
        <p>At OnTimeAuditor.com, customers can total their potential savings using an onscreen calculator. A company shipping 100 packages a month could save about $1,000 a year.</p>
        <p>The service is based on a program that Michael Harris, a software entrepreneur, developed in the 1980's to track the arrival of software packages he shipped to customers. He was frequently frustrated by customer complaints that packages had arrived late without the delivery service ever alerting him to the delays.</p>
        <p>''You just kind of assumed that it got there, and suddenly a customer would call and say it hadn't,'' Mr. Morse said. ''You're paying for a certain level of service.''</p>
        <p>So far, OnTimeAuditor is able to track only FedEx and U.P.S. shipments, but the company is planning to add other carriers this year. Mr. Morse estimates the entire package-refund market is worth about $2.5 billion a year.</p>
