        <p>A diamond-mining company with close ties to the governments of Congo and Zimbabwe may be thwarted in an effort to trade on the London Stock Exchange after reports of British government opposition to its plans, executives close to the company said tonight.</p>
        <p>Oryx Diamonds Ltd., registered in the Cayman Islands, had planned to seek a listing on the Alternative Investment Market, which is part of the London exchange, on Tuesday. The company is a result of a $75 million merger between Oryx Natural Resources and Petra Diamonds Ltd., a South African company that already trades on the same market. The plan has generated increasing public debate since the company said it intended to exploit a $1 billion diamond concession granted to it by a Congo government decree at a time when the British government is campaigning to halt the trade in so-called conflict diamonds.</p>
        <p>Geoffrey White, Oryx's deputy managing director, said that, despite the debate surrounding the company's plans, he and other executives thought their attempt to list shares on the London exchange was proceeding on track until soon after markets closed on Friday. At that time, trading in Petra Diamonds was formally suspended in accordance with merger rules and its new listing as Oryx Diamonds.</p>
        <p>Soon afterward, however, Mr. White said in a telephone interview, Oryx's advisers, the British accounting company Grant Thornton, informed the company that it had unspecified concerns about the deal and would resign if shareholders approved it at a meeting scheduled on Monday.</p>
        <p>Mr. White said that, without a nominated adviser, the company would not be permitted under stock market rules to list under its new name and resume trading.</p>
        <p>He said he did not know what was behind the company's change of plan and declined to comment on British newspaper reports today that the British Foreign Office -- which is leading the government's campaign against ''blood diamonds'' used to prolong African wars -- had put pressure on the advisers. Grant Thornton was not immediately available for comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. White said Oryx planned to proceed with its shareholders' meeting on Monday and would press Grant Thornton to explain its apparent shift at that gathering.</p>
        <p>While Oryx denies that its concession is in a war zone, it has acknowledged that the diamond field, south of the diamond-mining center of Mbuji-Mayi, is guarded by some of the 11,000 Zimbabwean troops who have been in the Congo since 1998 supporting President Laurent Kabila against rebel forces.</p>
        <p>The debate has forced one nonexecutive director, Moses Anafu to quit a high-ranking job with the 54-nation Commonwealth after his involvement with Oryx was publicized. At the time, Mr. Anafu was leading a Commonwealth delegation to Zimbabwe, where senior government and military officials are linked to Oryx through at least two Zimbabwe-registered companies, according to diplomats.</p>
        <p>Another nonexecutive director of Oryx, Frances Cook, is a former United States ambassador to Oman, where many of Oryx's managers, including its chief executive, are based. She has said repeatedly that she regards Oryx as a commercial venture that will benefit Africans in the concession area. Oryx says she will be entitled to a $100,000 annual fee plus stock options.</p>
