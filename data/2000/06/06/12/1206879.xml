        <p>Carrying black flags and a flower-wreathed portrait of Hafez al-Assad, the people of this border village held a memorial ceremony today for the leader of the country they call their own.</p>
        <p>The villagers, members of Mr. Assad's minority Alawite sect, chanted and wept in a demonstration of loyalty to Syria that was repeated today in the neighboring Druse villages of the Golan Heights, which was captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.</p>
        <p>In Majdal Shams, the largest village of Druse, a separate sect, hundreds gathered in the main square under Syrian flags to hear eulogies and poems of tribute, marching to a border fence to send condolences into Syria over a sound truck.</p>
        <p>Yet the ceremony here in Ghajar had a peculiar twist, befitting a village in limbo at the junction of Israel, Syria and Lebanon.</p>
        <p>After Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon last month, United Nations teams surveying the border determined that according to the line drawn in the 1920's, part of Ghajar actually lies in Lebanon, not the Israeli-held Golan Heights.</p>
        <p>Fearing that a border fence could soon divide families and separate people from their farmlands, villagers have barricaded entrances to Ghajar with burning tires and are standing guard armed with clubs to repel any United Nations teams that might come to mark the border.</p>
        <p>Forward scouts have been posted to summon the 1,700 residents to the streets if United Nations vehicles are spotted nearby.</p>
        <p>''The village will be divided over our dead bodies,'' said Imad Khatib, 35, a teacher. ''Without our lands we will be refugees. This is inhuman.''</p>
        <p>United Nations officials say they are simply marking the border and will not build a fence. They have stopped short of entering Ghajar, surveying the village by helicopter, residents said.</p>
        <p>The villagers insist that for generations they have been considered Syrian, not Lebanese, with Syrian identification papers and property deeds -- a message that was hammered home today by the memorial ceremony for Mr. Assad.</p>
        <p>''We in Ghajar are Syrian, and this is Syrian soil,'' said Salman Khatib, the leader of the local council. He stood in the village square, near an outlook over the Hasbani River that was decorated today with a likeness of Mr. Assad and a Syrian flag.</p>
        <p>Villagers said that in June 1967, when Israel captured the Golan Heights, its troops stopped short of Ghajar, considering it Lebanese territory. But the Lebanese authorities, reluctant to absorb an Alawite community into a land already divided by religious strife, told a delegation from Ghajar that their village was part of Syria and warned the group that if villagers crossed the Hasbani River into Lebanon, they would be shot or jailed.</p>
        <p>Residents then invited Israeli forces to take the village with the rest of the Golan, and the villagers were granted Israeli citizenship in the 1980's. Many now work in neighboring Israeli communities and speak fluent Hebrew.</p>
        <p>Matan Vilnai, an Israeli cabinet minister, visited Ghajar last week to calm residents' fears, telling them that his government was in contact with the United Nations and would work to ensure that the village remained undivided under Israeli control. An Israeli Army vehicle patrolled the village today.</p>
        <p>Despite the assurance, worried villagers said today that they wanted to avoid partition at all costs, even if that meant coming entirely under Lebanese control. A fence, they said, is out of the question.</p>
        <p>''Either we stay together or we will all die,'' said Mahmud Khatib, 40, a factory worker who stood guard with a club at the village entrance.</p>
        <p>Kamal Asad, 36, who also held a club, said: ''We didn't choose this situation. We've simply stuck to our land. The Berlin Wall came down after 30 years, and it can't be that in the year 2000 we will be divided by a fence.</p>
        <p>''We're not a herd of cows that can be split up. We're talking about human beings. The United Nations is supposed to unite people, not cut us in two. It should make peace, not pain. This is not political. We only want to live in dignity.''</p>
