        <p>When David Cone threw his perfect game against Montreal last July 18, rain delayed the game, with one out in the bottom of the third inning, for 33 minutes. Last night, Cone did not allow a hit to the Mets for three innings, and with one out in the bottom of the third, rain delayed the game, and eventually forced its postponement.</p>
        <p>In his sliver of action, Cone pitched better than he had all season. But he left Yankee Stadium feeling a bit frustrated, wishing the game could have continued. The Yankees led, 1-0, when play stopped;  after a delay of 1 hour 31 minutes, it was called off. As fans learned of the postponement, Robin Ventura of the Mets donned the No. 31 jersey of his teammate Mike Piazza and entertained the fans with an impression of the slugger, sliding headfirst across the rain-soaked tarp.</p>
        <p>No makeup date was set, and because the schedules of the Mets and Yankees rarely have them in town at the same time, it will be difficult to identify a day when they can play. Cone, who is the Yankees' player representative, mentioned that a few possibilities had been discussed, including a day-night doubleheader on July 7 or 8, with one game at Shea Stadium and the other at Yankee Stadium. ''The fans would have to have a police escort, too,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Another mutually acceptable day may be Aug. 31, but the Yankees play in Seattle the day before, and unless they do not play Aug. 31, they will have to play 45 straight days.</p>
        <p>It was disappointing to have the postponement, Yankees Manager Joe Torre said, but at least Cone could walk away feeling good about what he had done, about the adjustments he had made. ''If you're talking about the season ahead,'' Torre said, ''what he did today had to be beneficial.''</p>
        <p>Cone said: ''I'm not going to grasp onto three innings and tell you guys I'm back. I've got to prove it. I've got to be consistent.''</p>
        <p>Cone has been unable to throw a consistently good slider this year, a serious problem, for Cone needs the pitch to combat right-handed batters, who were hitting .326 against him this year going into last night's game, 112 points higher than last year. Cone and the Yankees' pitching coach, Mel Stottlemyre, searched for the slider in their last bullpen workout, refining the arm angle at which Cone throws the pitch. Lo and behold, they felt they found something.</p>
        <p>So Cone was eager to pitch and employ the adjustments he made. As he finished his pregame warm-up and departed the Yankees' bullpen in left-center field, he chatted briefly with Stottlemyre, smiling slightly. But by the time he reached the Yankees' dugout, his face was cold and serious.</p>
        <p>He dumped the change he made earlier in the season; no longer did he hold his hands low and in front of him as he looked in for the sign. He went back to his old mechanics, and altered his approach. Rather than use his off-speed pitches early in the count, he relied on his fastball, throwing it with the first pitch to eight of the nine hitters the first time through the lineup, to get ahead in the count. His fastball reached 88 miles an hour, and he threw inside.</p>
        <p>And his slider was sharp -- not the sweeping slider he had thrown in the past, but a slider with a quick, finishing bite -- and he struck out Edgardo Alfonzo with it to end the first inning. Because of this, he was able to freeze Mike Piazza and Jay Payton with third-strike fastballs in the second inning. He struck out four and walked two over his three hitless innings, needing just 44 pitches. If the game had continued and Cone had held the Mets hitless in the fourth, it would have been the first time in the regular season since his perfect game that he threw four consecutive hitless innings.</p>
        <p>''It was probably the best slider I had all year,'' Cone said. ''I knew they had a lot of right-handed batters, and I knew I had to have the slider.</p>
        <p>''In some ways, I'm kind of embarrassed to be talking about a three-inning stint turning me around.''</p>
        <p>Cone's next start will come Friday, against the White Sox.</p>
        <p>Better, but Not Quite There</p>
        <p>With each turn he took in batting practice yesterday, Chuck Knoblauch's swing gained speed and strength, and by the last round, he was hitting a few line drives. Knoblauch was not in the starting lineup last night, but he is expected to play tonight, in the start of a three-game series against the Boston Red Sox.</p>
        <p>Setback for Johnson</p>
        <p>Nick Johnson, one of the Yankees' top prospects, has had a setback in his comeback from a sprained hand he first injured early in spring training. Johnson began swinging a bat a few weeks ago, and the Yankees were hoping he would be able to start playing games in late June or early July. But Johnson is feeling discomfort again and has backed off on his workouts.</p>
        <p>Johnson, a first baseman, is crucial to the Yankees' plans, for they eventually expect him to play that position in the big leagues. The Yankees hoped he would play in  Class AAA this entire year and perhaps contend with Tino Martinez for the major league job next year. Martinez is signed through the 2001 season.</p>
        <p>Ed Yarnall, who has been on the disabled list, is expected to pitch a simulated game today, and if all goes well in his comeback from a strained muscle in his back, he will rejoin Class AAA Columbus late next week.</p>
