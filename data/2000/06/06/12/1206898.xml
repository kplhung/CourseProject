        <p>''They call it sudden death,'' a weary Mike Modano said early this morning. ''And it feels like it.''</p>
        <p>Talk about a mood swing. Two days earlier, Modano, the Dallas Stars' center, had scored in the third overtime in New Jersey to extend the Stanley Cup finals to a sixth game. This morning, Modano and the rest of the Stars knew exactly how the Devils had felt.</p>
        <p>With the tension mounting with each rush up the ice late Saturday night, the Devils' Jason Arnott finally finished off the Stars, 2-1, with the cup-clinching goal at 8 minutes 20 seconds of the second overtime.</p>
        <p>Arnott's overtime goal was the 15th in history to clinch a Stanley Cup. The Devils won their second cup in franchise history, and first since 1995, while keeping the Stars from repeating as National Hockey League champions.</p>
        <p>Not since 1993 had consecutive games in the finals gone to overtime. Montreal defeated Los Angeles in extra time in Games 2, 3 and 4 to take the 1993 finals in five games.</p>
        <p>Not since 1951, when Toronto defeated Montreal, four games to one, with all five games going to overtime, had the last two games of a finals series gone past regulation.</p>
        <p>And not since Games 2 and 3 of the 1931 finals, then played under a three-of-five-game format, had there been consecutive multiple overtimes in the finals. Montreal shook off losses to Chicago in both those games and took the cup, three games to two.</p>
        <p>This year, the Stars and the Devils played a combined 74 minutes 41 seconds of overtime over parts of five periods since Thursday night. It was no wonder they were physically beat.</p>
        <p>''And in overtime, it only takes one play and the series is over,'' Derian Hatcher, the Dallas captain, said. ''That's what happened tonight.''</p>
        <p>Hatcher had ended the series for Petr Sykora much earlier -- 12:08 into the game -- with a vicious elbow that necessitated a stretcher to take Sykora off the ice. Sykora spent the night in a hospital, cheering the Devils on.</p>
        <p>Hatcher, who could barely walk after Game 6, displayed no remorse for the hit.</p>
        <p>''I was scared when he didn't get up for a while,'' Hatcher said. ''But someone said he was moving and talking. Those were the real important things.''</p>
        <p>Sykora made the trip back to New Jersey, and the Devils, who won all three games on Dallas ice, were able to avoid a Game 7.</p>
        <p>''Both goaltenders were really good,'' said Dallas's 40-year-old center, Guy Carbonneau, who may have played the final game of his career. Carbonneau was referring to his teammate Ed Belfour, who stopped 91 of 93 shots over Games 5 and 6, including 43 of 45 on Saturday night, and the Devils' Martin Brodeur, who turned aside 70 of the 72 shots fired his way the final two games.</p>
        <p>''But you can always look at we had three games at home and we lost three games,'' Carbonneau said. ''That hurts.''</p>
        <p>The Stars were able to make the series memorable, however, after falling behind by three games to one, and that seemed to take some of the sting out of the loss. The Stars were plagued by serious injuries all season.</p>
        <p>Few had predicted that they would make it this far in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''Everyone is upset that we lost,'' Carbonneau said. ''But if you look back on our season, we did some unbelievable things to come two games within winning the Stanley Cup.''</p>
        <p>The Stars saved some of their most unbelievable moments for Games 5 and 6 of the finals.</p>
        <p>''Those were just two unbelievable games,'' Coach Ken Hitchcock said.</p>
