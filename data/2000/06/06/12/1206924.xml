        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While these particular grandparents lost their case, the Supreme Court's decision (front page, June 6) actually grants lower courts broad powers to make decisions favorable to grandparents.</p>
        <p>That parental autonomy deserves protection has never been seriously questioned. The plurality decision says that as long as judges apply the presumption that parents are acting in a child's best interest, visitation rights might be granted to nonparents if they can rebut this presumption.</p>

        <p>While these particular grandparents lost their case, the Supreme Court's decision (front page, June 6) actually grants lower courts broad powers to make decisions favorable to grandparents.</p>
        <p>That parental autonomy deserves protection has never been seriously questioned. The plurality decision says that as long as judges apply the presumption that parents are acting in a child's best interest, visitation rights might be granted to nonparents if they can rebut this presumption.</p>
        <p>In this particular case, the court concluded only that the Washington State judge failed to apply the presumption in the first place.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court has left visitation decisions firmly in the hands of judges.</p>
