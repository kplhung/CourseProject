        <p>The party and nation that Hafez al-Assad ruled for 30 years until his death this weekend moved swiftly today to anoint his son Bashar as Syria's new president, raising prospects that at least the nominal trappings of power in the highly militarized state may pass peacefully to a new generation.</p>
        <p>Thousands of weeping Syrians took to the streets of Damascus, shouting their grief over the death of Mr. Assad and their devotion to his son, a reserved 34-year-old eye doctor who inherits an insular nation still at war with Israel, in control of the government and militant groups in Lebanon, and struggling to find its place in a region that has passed it by economically.</p>
        <p>''God, Syria and Bashar only,'' people chanted as they marched through the capital, which was patrolled by squadrons of uniformed security officers who kept a close watch on the demonstrations. In normal times, public gatherings are not permitted in Syria.</p>
        <p>Cementing his claim to his father's job, the younger Mr. Assad secured a number of new titles and positions today. Abdel-Halim Khaddam, one of Syria's two vice presidents who are nominally running the country now, named him the commander of Syria's armed forces, at the same time promoting him from the rank of colonel to lieutenant-general.</p>
        <p>In addition, the regional command, or governing body, of the ruling Bath Party unanimously nominated him for the presidency. Parliament must also endorse the nomination, and set a date for a referendum to confirm the choice.</p>
        <p>The Parliament has already amended the country's Constitution to reduce the minimum age for a president to 34 from 40, briskly eliminating a legal obstacle to Mr. Assad's ascension.</p>
        <p>The young Mr. Assad, a relative neophyte who held no official position in the government or the party while his father was alive, is unlikely to command anything close to the independence and absolute authority of the deceased ruler. The uncertainty caused by the sudden death of his father rippled beneath statements of support for Mr. Assad issued by Mideast leaders today.</p>
        <p>Perhaps nowhere is the unease greater than in Lebanon, a country under Syrian sway that has now seen two major shifts -- the withdrawal of Israeli troops from its south and a transition in Damascus -- in as many weeks.</p>
        <p>However, the bestowal of new titles and positions gave the younger Mr. Assad a strong measure of public legitimacy by propelling him to the top of Syria's tight and secretive military and political hierarchy.</p>
        <p>Over the past six years, since the death of his older brother Basil, Mr. Assad had been assiduously but quietly groomed for succession. He has steadily advanced in military rank and acted as his father's liaison to Lebanon, the client state that Syria runs politically and militarily.</p>
        <p>In recent months, the creation of a clean and forceful image for Mr. Assad took on a new urgency. He has been credited in the state-controlled press with helping choose a younger and supposedly more progressive set of ministers and with managing a major anti-corruption drive.</p>
        <p>The purge has been aimed at some of the old guard in the government and in the security services who might have been expected to resist automatically transferring their loyalty from the father to the son.</p>
        <p>The most recent victim was Hikmat Shehabi, the former chief of the Syrian Army and one-time member of Syria's negotiating team with Israel. Mr. Shehabi was reported to have fled Syria last week.</p>
        <p>''It would have been difficult for him to ascend among the generation of his father's age,'' said Joseph Samaha, a political analyst with the pan-Arab daily newspaper Al-Hayat. ''The old guard, many of whom retired due to age or for other reasons, would have had a hard time communicating with and taking orders from Bashar.''</p>
        <p>The loyalty of a group of middle-aged officers and party officials who have coalesced around Mr. Assad remains to be tested. But the endorsements he acquired in less than 48 hours after his father's death virtually assure him the presidency, barring any attempt by disgruntled army officers or displaced party officials to seize power.</p>
        <p>Although his position would have to be confirmed by a public vote, presidential elections in Syria for the past three decades have been pro-forma affairs limited to one candidate -- the elder Mr. Assad -- who generally won nearly 100 percent of the votes cast.</p>
        <p>Syrian authorities, meanwhile, were completing plans for a massive funeral on Tuesday for the former president, who ruled Syria through two major Arab-Israeli wars. He died of an apparent heart attack at the age of 69 on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Plans call for a procession of the body through Damascus and a formal ceremony in the capital, where world leaders are expected to pay their respects. The body will then be transported to the small hilltop village of Qurdaha, Mr. Assad's once impoverished hometown, for burial near the tombs of his mother and his eldest son, Basil.</p>
        <p>Among those who have indicated they will attend the funeral are the heads of state of most Arab countries; Iran's President, Mohammad Khatami; a vice president of neighboring Iraq, which was considered an enemy of Syria during Mr. Assad's reign; and the French president, Jacques Chirac, the only Western head of state who plans to be present and who played host to Bashar Assad on the young Syrian's first official talks in the West in Paris last November.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will represent the United States, which has had an ambiguous relationship to Syria in the past few decades. While under Hafez al-Assad, Syria joined the anti-Iraq coalition in the Gulf War. But it has for over two decades also been considered by the State Department to be a sponsor of terrorism.</p>
        <p>The latest attempt at forging a peace between Syria and Israel -- and by extension, between Lebanon and Israel -- broke down in mid-January. A meeting between President Clinton and the late President Assad in Geneva in March failed to break the logjam.</p>
        <p>The younger Mr. Assad inherits the foreign policy issues that occupied his father, but may not have the same freedom to strike a deal with Israel. He has also been left an unsettled situation in Lebanon, where the abrupt Israeli withdrawal put pressure on Syria to rein in the militias that it had supported in the formerly occupied zone in the south.</p>
        <p>Mr. Assad, according to political sources in Lebanon, will probably rely for advice on the peace effort and internal security on some of his father's confidantes, like Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara, as well as a group of about six army and intelligence officers whose power has increased with the recent purge and forced retirement of many of the more senior officers.</p>
        <p>Among the advisers to Mr. Assad are his brother-in-law Asef Shoukat, Hassan Khalil, Hashem Bakhtiar, Iyad Mahmoud and Asef el-Hakim -- all brigadier generals or generals.</p>
        <p>Tributes to the former Syrian leader continued to pour in from other Arab leaders, who described him as a tenacious ruler who clung to the ideals of Arab nationalism long after they were set aside as out-dated or impractical by other rulers.</p>
        <p>The accolades were especially effusive in Lebanon, where officials credited the Syrian strongman with helping to end their civil war. Syria still treats much smaller neighbor as a satellite state and keeps some 30,000 soldiers and an unknown number of intelligence agents based here.</p>
        <p>But a clear strain of anxiety underlay the eulogies. Many in the region expressed concern for the future stability of Syria, which suffered through a series of military coups and revolving-door governments before Hafez al-Assad seized power in 1970.</p>
        <p>In Cairo, the Egyptian cabinet met to discuss the ramifications of the Syrian leader's death. It was the only subject on the agenda.</p>
        <p>''We were shocked by the death of a colleague and a brother,'' President Hosni Mubarak said after the meeting. ''We hope from deep in our hearts that Syria will be stable, and we will support the leadership. We respect the Syrian people's opinion in choosing their president.''</p>
        <p>In the United States, the lack of open opposition to Bashar al-Assad's ascension also was seen as a positive sign. ''It seems to me that the initial signs that we have seen suggest that there is a very smooth transition process underway,'' said Dennis Ross, President Clinton's special envoy for the Middle East, in an interview on ABC News. ''I would expect that we will see that go forward. We'll be able to make a judgment, but on the whole, it seems to me that the structure that is being put in place is a structure that suggests that the transition will be smooth.''</p>
        <p>If he does consolidate his hold on Syria, Mr. Assad would join a new generation of Arab leaders who were bequeathed power by their fathers despite their lack of military or political credentials. Over the past two years, power has passed peacefully to the sons of long-ruling monarchs in Jordan, Morocco and Qatar, who, like Mr. Assad, came of age after the major dislocations and loss of territory that followed the Arab-Israeli wars.</p>
