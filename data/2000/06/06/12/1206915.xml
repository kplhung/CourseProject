        <p>Guy J. Velella  Bronx and Westchester Counties  1996 election: unopposed  1998: 58 percent  District voter registration: 54 percent Democrat, 22 percent Republican</p>
        <p>Of the districts in New York held by Republicans, this district, arcing across the north and east Bronx and into southern Westchester, is the most heavily Democratic. But the greatest threat to Mr. Velella could be from Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, who recently sent investigators with search warrants to take files from the senator's offices, as part of an investigation whose purpose has not been revealed.</p>

        <p>These are the Republicans in the State Senate who are widely viewed as vulnerable in this year's elections. They are listed in order, from most vulnerable to least, as seen by a wide sampling of politicians and political analysts.</p>
        <p>RICHARD PEREZ-PENA</p>
        <p>Guy J. Velella  Bronx and Westchester Counties  1996 election: unopposed  1998: 58 percent  District voter registration: 54 percent Democrat, 22 percent Republican</p>
        <p>Of the districts in New York held by Republicans, this district, arcing across the north and east Bronx and into southern Westchester, is the most heavily Democratic. But the greatest threat to Mr. Velella could be from Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, who recently sent investigators with search warrants to take files from the senator's offices, as part of an investigation whose purpose has not been revealed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Velella, a senator since 1986, could face a serious challenger for the first time in many years. Lorraine Coyle Koppell, wife of a former state attorney general, G. Oliver Koppell, is running for this seat, but she must first win a Democratic primary against Michael Benedetto.</p>
        <p>Frank A. Padavan  Queens  1996 election: unopposed  1998: 59 percent  Voter registration: 52 percent Democrat, 23 percent Republican</p>
        <p>In this district in northeastern Queens, the minority and immigrant populations have increased steadily for years, a shift that could work in a Democrat's favor. Mr. Padavan, a senator since 1973, is generally more conservative than his district. His opponent this year, Rory Lancman, a young lawyer and community board member, may be the strongest Democrat he has faced in many years.</p>
        <p>Nicholas A. Spano  Westchester County  1996 election: 52 percent  1998: 59 percent  Voter registration: 44 percent Democrat, 28 percent Republican</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano's centrist politics are a good fit for his district, but he has had some close calls. In 1996, he had a political near-death experience running against Thomas Abinanti, majority leader of the Westchester County Legislature, who is running again this year. This time, Mr. Spano, a senator since 1987, will be taking Mr. Abinanti more seriously, but then again, so will the Democrats, who put few resources behind the challenger four years ago.</p>
        <p>Thomas A. Morahan  Rockland and Orange Counties  1999 special election: 53 percent  Voter registration: 42 percent Democrat, 28 percent Republican</p>
        <p>Mr. Morahan barely won this seat in a special election last year, and the higher turnout of a general election in a presidential year typically helps Democrats. He faces the same opponent he did last year, Kenneth P. Zebrowski, chairman of the Rockland County Legislature. Mr. Morahan has been in poor health, a factor that some Republicans fear will limit his ability to campaign.</p>
        <p>Roy M. Goodman  Manhattan  1996 election: 62 percent  1998: 56 percent  Voter registration: 52 percent Democrat, 23 percent Republican.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodman, a senator since 1969, is the most liberal Republican in the Senate, and is well liked in his Upper East Side district, but he, too, has had some close calls. In the 1998 election, he had the weakest showing of any incumbent senator. He could face his strongest Democratic opponent in years: Liz Krueger, who heads the Community Food Resource Center and has some family wealth behind her candidacy. She faces a Democratic primary against Rob Bellinson, a lawyer who has run against Mr. Goodman twice.</p>
        <p>Kemp Hannon  Nassau County  1996 election: 57 percent  1998: 60 percent  Voter registration: 46 percent Republican, 31 percent Democrat</p>
        <p>Mr. Hannon's Republican colleagues sometimes grumble that he is more enthusiastic about legislation than about campaigning, while Democrats say he spends more time in Albany than in his district. His district, strung across the midsection of the county, includes the largest concentration of minority voters on Long Island, but this is normally a safe Republican seat. The question, as with all the Nassau districts, is whether last year's backlash against the Nassau Republican party carries over to this November. Mr. Hannon, a senator since 1989, faces Anthony D. Macagnone, a member of the Oyster Bay Town Board and a carpenters' union official, who was also the Democratic candidate two years ago.</p>
        <p>Michael A. Balboni  Nassau County  1997 special election: 61 percent  1998: 58 percent  Voter registration: 39 percent Republican, 34 percent Democrat.</p>
        <p>Of the nine Long Island districts, this is the one where Democrats come closest to parity in voter registration. It is also the place with the freshest example of rebellion by Nassau voters against the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>In a special election last month for County Legislature, in a district overlapping Mr. Balboni's, the Democrat crushed a Republican and an independent. But politicians in both parties say Mr. Balboni, a senator since 1997, has been tireless and effective at making himself popular in his district. He faces John Brooks, a lawyer who was his Democratic opponent two years ago.</p>
        <p>Carl L. Marcellino  Nassau and Suffolk Counties  1996: 59 percent  1998: 60 percent  Voter registration: 41 percent Republican, 30 percent Democrat</p>
        <p>Mr. Marcellino, a senator since 1995, has the advantage that almost half his district lies in Suffolk County (he also represents the northeast section of Nassau), where there has been no rebellion against Republicans. But even his colleagues say he is not much of a campaigner, and this year he has a fairly well-known opponent. The Democrat is Lawrence H. Silverman, president of the Long Island Rail Road Commuters Council.</p>
