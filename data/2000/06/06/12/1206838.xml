        <p>Web journalism is usually cast as savior or savage. For some people, online journalism is a path to interactive enlightenment and economic liberty. But to the puritans of the old media world, Web journalists are apostates who have confused liberty with license and whose delusional disregard for profit can end only in self-immolation.</p>
        <p>It was hard for the puritans not to act smug last week.</p>
        <p>The aftershocks of the Nasdaq's April collapse, which had already shaken the E-commerce world, hit news and information sites. Salon and CBS.com both announced layoffs. And the crime news site APBNews .com became an undead dot-com, dismissing its staff of 140, then allowing some to hang on, unpaid, while the bosses sought new partners to bring the site back to life.</p>
        <p>Last week's tremors forced analysts and other Web publishers to conduct various forms of industry damage assessment -- and consider what it may take to make surviving sites earthquake resistant.</p>
        <p>''No one is going to be terribly surprised that this sector of the industry is going to consolidate,'' predicted Peter Petrusky, director of new media for the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. ''The future belongs to those sites that are developing multiple revenue streams.''</p>
        <p>Mark Mooradian, an Internet analyst at Jupiter Communications, said that the week's events clearly signaled the more cautious approach by investors. ''It is mostly a testament to the fact that capital availability is drying up,'' he said. ''If these guys want to lessen their burn rates in any substantial way they have to slim down.''</p>
        <p>Burn rate, of course, refers to money up in smoke. And Mr. Mooradian noted that many of the Web companies, including online journalism sites, had spent lavishly on marketing because they had been assured that they would be able to raise second rounds of financing, whether through venture capital investments, strategic investment or public offerings. But, he said, ''that window has now closed.''</p>
        <p>An exception might seem to be Inside .com, the new, richly financed media news site led by the author and editor Kurt Andersen. But because it takes money to burn money, some analysts wonder how long such a site -- providing expensive, original reporting -- can withstand budget-minded competitors.</p>
        <p>Take MediaNews, the daily roundup assembled by Jim Romenesko. For a good deal less than $100,000 a year, coffee included, Mr. Romenesko can match much of Inside.com's speed and depth on his MediaNews site, simply by studding his digest with hyperlinks to the work of other journalists -- including Inside.com's. ''You're right, I rely on reporters around the world to give me the good content, and I'm the editor,'' said Mr. Romenesko, who works for a $80,000 annual salary from the Poynter Institute for Media Studies.</p>
        <p>Even more automated is Moreover.com, founded by a former newspaper reporter. The site uses technology that monitors content sites for articles, then lists them as headlines and provides hot links to originating sites -- including the Web sites of the BBC, CNN and The New York Times.</p>
        <p>Readers can customize a Moreover.com home page to get the kinds of news they are most interested in, and other publishers can arrange links -- as George magazine's Web site (georgemag.com) does for Moreover's political headlines.</p>
        <p>Reuters and Advance.net, the Internet arm of Advance Publications, which owns Conde Nast, are expected to announce today that, along with Soundview Ventures, they have invested $21 million in Moreover.com.</p>
        <p>Of course, the aggregation game is not restricted to tiny upstarts. America Online's news section draws 14 million distinct visitors monthly, 70 percent more than the nearest old-media news site, MSNBC.com. America Online offers wire-service dispatches from Bloomberg News and Reuters; readers can also link to the reports of other news organizations.</p>
        <p>When Editor &amp; Publisher Online did not include America Online in a recent analysis of news sites, Gary Kebbel, director of AOL's news, e-mailed Carl Sullivan, Editor &amp; Publisher Online's editor, to take issue. Mr. Kebbel contended that in many communities more people use AOL as an online news source than use the Web sites of their local newspapers.</p>
        <p>So what does the trend toward sites that repackage someone else's journalism mean for online publishers that are intent on actually reporting, writing and editing their own material?</p>
        <p>Slate, the online magazine with probably the highest profile in online journalism, has the advantage of a giant parent: Microsoft. After Slate's debut in 1996, its early setbacks were closely watched by the envious. And after its much-admired editor Michael Kinsley had to abandon his attempt to lure paying subscribers, for instance, most others did not even try.</p>
        <p>So far, The Wall Street Journal, with its subscription-based Wall Street Journal Interactive online service, seems to be one of the few news and information sites finding a steady audience of paying customers. Meanwhile, Slate now runs promotional advertorials -- Blue Nile diamonds, anyone? -- in its table of contents, although the Magazine Publishers of America guidelines ask print magazines not to do so.</p>
        <p>With little hope of subscription revenue, Web sites have imitated the broadcast TV model, seeking to attract big audiences and sell them to advertisers. And advertisers have obliged, increasing their Web spending from $906.5 million in 1997 to $1.9 billion in 1998 and $4.6 billion in 1999, according to the Internet Advertising Bureau.</p>
        <p>Yet, of that 1999 total only 8 percent went to news and information sites, according to a report prepared for the bureau by Pricewaterhouse. By comparison, search engines and portals, like Yahoo.com or About .com took in 38 percent of the total. Technology-related sites took in 18 percent; financial sites, 15 percent.</p>
        <p>In search of other forms of revenue, some online publishers have turned to licensing deals. CBS's MarketWatch.com, a leading financial news site, owns a service called Big Chart that creates financial charts. MarketWatch's its chief executive, Larry Kramer, estimates that while 75 percent of the site's revenue in 2000 will probably come from advertising, most of the rest is likely to come from licensing the chart technology to other online publishers.</p>
        <p>And not everyone has given up on the subscription model. Inside.com, for example, plans to charge $217 annually for subscriptions -- despite the rollback on subscription charges by other high-maintenance sites with lots of original content.</p>
        <p>Inside.com executives contend that readers will be willing to pay for high-quality material. But Deanna Brown, the chief operating officer at Inside, said that the expense of the site's comprehensive coverage was worth the freedom from old-media constraints. The established media companies have the benefit of established brands and experienced managers, she said. The drawback, she said, ''is that they have legacy publications they have to be concerned with, and they don't offer entrepreneurial opportunities to talent.''</p>
        <p>Established media companies, however, do not necessarily see their legacy publications as dead weight.</p>
        <p>Peter Bart, the editor in chief of the entertainment trade publication Variety, contends that the best efficiencies come from a new-media offshoot borrowing from and contributing to an old-media original. Thus does Variety play give-and-take with its Variety.com Web site. ''The key to the Variety site,'' he said, ''is that it is derived from the basic old brand.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bart said that last week he hired four new staff members and planned to hire 20 more this year. He also plans to expand the Web site's coverage of raw entertainment industry data, a franchise on which Inside.com is also placing an emphasis.</p>
        <p>So who's winning -- the puritans or the apostates? It may be too soon to tell, but certainly last week's upheavals were enough to try a Web journalist's soul.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Ken Layne, a columnist for Online Journalism Review (www.ojr.org), posted a piece saying, ''Whenever the dot-com business/media system is bumming me out beyond my ability to type -- generally, every three or four months -- I convene other disgusted new-economy scribes and present the question, 'How in hell did we end up doing something so gut-wrenchingly stupid?' ''</p>
