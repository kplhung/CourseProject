        <p>Facing an important deadline next month, Justice Department prosecutors are redoubling their efforts to prove that Sotheby's and Christie's, the world's most powerful auction houses, hatched a scheme to fix the prices they charged buyers and sellers and that the collusion began as early as 1991.</p>
        <p>The prosecutors are racing to beat a July 18 deadline, set by the court hearing civil suits in the case, that could expose the best kept secrets of their long antitrust investigation.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks the prosecutors have made calls to more than a dozen present and former auction house employees, potential witnesses and lawyers say, asking them for voluntary interviews and testimony before a grand jury. They have been striving to back up claims of collusion as far back as 1991 made late last year by Christie's former chief executive, Christopher M. Davidge, in particular over commissions charged to buyers.</p>
        <p>While the prosecutors are said to feel they have a good case that the two houses conspired to fix sellers' commissions in 1995, evidence of earlier collusion directed at buyers' fees is largely confined to Mr. Davidge's allegations, backed up by documents he has provided that in some instances are not dated.</p>
        <p>What prosecutors are most eager to keep secret, lawyers said, is what exactly is spelled out in a dozen documents that Mr. Davidge, who abruptly resigned on Christmas Eve, turned over to Christie's lawyers. The lawyers then gave them to the government in exchange for a conditional amnesty from prosecution for Christie's, a tradeoff that sent the lagging federal investigation into high gear.</p>
        <p>On May 12 the government's chief antitrust prosecutor in New York, John J. Greene, argued in favor of keeping the documents out of the hands of lawyers suing Sotheby's and Christie's to maintain the secrecy of its grand jury investigation -- now almost three years old -- through at least August. But Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who is hearing a civil class action lawsuit by auction house customers who claim they were cheated by collusive practices, voiced impatience with the government's pace. The following week he ordered Mr. Davidge's documents to be made available starting on July 18 to the lawyers, who are suing on behalf of dozens if not hundreds of complainants. The judge could, however, still modify his order and delay the document turnover.</p>
        <p>Leading the 60 or more law firms handling the plaintiffs' suits is the firm of David Boies, who is fresh from his victory as the government's special counsel in the lawsuit to break up Microsoft. The firm, Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner, of Armonk, N.Y., was named lead counsel by Judge Kaplan on May 26 through an unusual bidding process he devised. The process was intended to determine which lawyers would offer plaintiffs the greatest share of a settlement by holding down legal fees.</p>
        <p>Apart from the criminal penalties, if the Justice Department is successful in establishing that the price-fixing dates back nine years, civil awards could cripple both companies, lawyers representing various parties in the tangled case agreed. One lawyer suing the auction houses said that the damages could run well into the hundreds of millions of dollars, which, when tripled under provisions in such cases, could mean combined losses to Sotheby's and Christie's of close to $1.5 billion.</p>
        <p>Several people close to the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity citing the continuing investigation, said that prosecutors seem specifically focused on gathering facts regarding 1991 and 1992. Those were the years both companies made the decision to change the fees they charge buyers from a flat rate of 10 percent of the purchase price to 15 percent of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Sotheby's announced the change in November 1992, and Christie's followed with an identical fee structure a little over a month later.</p>
        <p>Even if they did not collude on setting the fees originally, they could be in violation of federal antitrust statutes if in subsequent years they simply discussed maintaining the fee structure, said an experienced antitrust lawyer. Lawyers and others close to the case have said that the government has evidence that Sotheby's and Christie's exchanged lists of important collectors who were to be exempt from sellers' fees.</p>
        <p>People close to the investigation say the Justice Department has also asked witnesses about whether other topics came up in conversations between Mr. Davidge and Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's chief executive, who resigned on Feb. 21. These include whether they worked out a policy not to poach each other's staffs and whether they had spoken about how to negotiate with the French government about opening the Paris auction business to non-French companies.</p>
        <p>The reasons for queries about these matters are unclear, although experienced antitrust lawyers said that in some circumstances ''no poaching'' agreements may have antitrust implications and that in other antitrust cases conversations about benign topics, akin to negotiating with the French over auction laws, have turned to questionable issues that figured heavily in prosecutions.</p>
        <p>In addition to examining Rolodexes, diaries and telephone logs, prosecutors have asked auction house employees -- including present and former art and antiques experts and a former in-house lawyer -- about what they may know of any discussions between the two houses.</p>
        <p>Whether the government is trying to run down additional leads in an already strong case or buttress a weak one is not clear, said lawyers representing parties in the civil and antitrust actions. The government already believes it has substantial proof that the people who were then chief executives and chairmen of the two companies -- Ms. Brooks and A. Alfred Taubman at Sotheby's, and Mr. Davidge and Sir Anthony Tennant at Christie's -- conspired to raise sellers' fees in 1995, people close to the investigation say.</p>
        <p>But lawyers involved in the case believe the prosecution has not been able to establish a case that four years earlier Sotheby's and Christie's executives also agreed to fix the prices they charged buyers. The allegations of early collusion are potentially far more costly to both companies because, if substantiated, they would open a new class of plaintiffs that is far larger than the number of sellers.</p>
        <p>Among the documents from Mr. Davidge that Christie's law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, provided to federal prosecutors in December are memorandums Mr. Davidge wrote to Sir Anthony, lawyers involved in the case said. They said the memorandums detailed the progress of meetings he had with Ms. Brooks to set the new commission fees.</p>
        <p>People familiar with the documents but who spoke only on condition of anonymity because of the continuing investigation, said that the documents contain references to collusion over the buyers' fees in the 1991-92 period. But some of the documents are not dated, people familiar with them said. As a result, the government has been seeking confirming testimony from other witnesses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davidge said that it was Sir Anthony, chairman of Christie's from 1993 to '96, who asked him to meet with Ms. Brooks, his counterpart at Sotheby's, to agree on fixing its buyers' and sellers' charges, people familiar with his allegations say. A person close to Ms. Brooks said she has let prosecutors know that under certain conditions of immunity from prosecution, she would be prepared to testify that Sotheby's chairman, Mr. Taubman (who resigned as chairman the same day she did as chief executive) had asked her to meet with Mr. Davidge over sellers' fees. But the person close to Ms. Brooks was unable to confirm any talks involving buyers' fees starting in 1991.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brooks kept no records of the secret meetings she had with Mr. Davidge, people familiar with the case say.</p>
        <p>People close to Ms. Brooks said that prosecutors were pressing her for admissions that carried grave penalties, including possible prison time.</p>
        <p>Since the beginning of the investigation lawyers close to Sotheby's have said while Mr. Taubman did meet with Sir Anthony in the early to mid-1990's, the conversations were innocent and had nothing to do with a conspiracy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greene, the chief prosecutor in the case, said he would not comment on the investigation in any way.</p>
        <p>Andrew J. Levander, a Manhattan lawyer who has been hired by Sotheby's to represent some of its employees who are being contacted by the government, declined to comment on whether he was involved in the case.</p>
