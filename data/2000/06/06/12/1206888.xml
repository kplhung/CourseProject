        <p>South Korean officials remained confident today that the first summit meeting with North Korea would proceed normally on Tuesday despite an unexpected 24-hour delay by the North.</p>
        <p>North Korean officials surprised their southern counterparts on Sunday with a request for the delay of the three-day meeting for unspecified ''minor technical reasons.''</p>
        <p>The postponement set off rife speculation over the cause, with analysts here focusing on security arrangements, the death of President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, a longtime ally, or matters as mundane as the erratic electricity supply and telecommunications networks in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, where the meeting is to be held.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, South Korean officials say they are still hopeful that the meeting can yield progress on reducing the tensions that have made the divided peninsula the most heavily armed place in the world, ultimately including a pledge by Pyongyang to forswear nuclear weapons development.</p>
        <p>In addition, Seoul's main allies, the United States and Japan, have pressed for emphasis on reducing the threat from North Korea's ballistic missile program, which has helped provoke proposals in Washington to spend billions of dollars on an elaborate missile defense system.</p>
        <p>Despite a half-century of military hostilities and fierce ideological competition between the two countries, not to mention the North's renowned unpredictability, officials here said they had few doubts that the delay would prove to be only a momentary setback.</p>
        <p>Among other reasons for this confidence, they cited the presence of a 30-member advance team already in North Korea. ''We will definitely go on Tuesday,'' said Moon Chung In, an academic who is part of the official southern delegation. ''There is no major problem.''</p>
        <p>North Korea's first leader, Kim Il Sung, died in July 1994, just days before the only other previously scheduled summit meeting between the two countries, and the gulf between the two countries widened drastically in the ensuing years. Just last year, the two countries engaged in a fierce naval skirmish in the Yellow Sea, raising anew the prospect of war across the border.</p>
        <p>Diplomats said, though, that the uncharacteristically intense recent diplomatic activity by North Korea was the best gauge of its seriousness about engaging the South and lifting the country's reclusive veil.</p>
        <p>This month, the Korean president, Kim Jong Il, paid a surprise visit to China, his first trip outside the country since he succeeded his father. Since then, Mr. Kim has invited the Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin, for a visit to Pyongyang that is expected to take place in July.</p>
        <p>Pyongyang has also recently busily established diplomatic relations with a wide range of nontraditional partners. These have included countries from Italy to Australia, and talks aimed at restoring or establishing ties with others are proceeding.</p>
        <p>Last week, Washington announced that it could soon lift most economic sanctions that remain in place on North Korea, most of which are tied to the the State Department's listing of the country as a supporter of terrorism.</p>
        <p>''It is clear that something important is going on here, and the North-South meeting is obviously the centerpiece,'' one senior Western diplomat said.</p>
        <p>''It is hard to say just how far or how fast this will all proceed, but to not have spoken to someone for 50 years and then be seated at the same table is itself historic.''</p>
        <p>In recent days, a major concern of the South Korean government has been controlling high public expectations over the first meeting between leaders of the countries. In briefing after briefing, South Korean officials have stressed that the summit meeting should be seen as only the beginning of what they hope will be regular, high-level contacts between the two countries.</p>
        <p>The two presidents, Kim Dae Jung and Kim Jong Il are expected to meet at least twice during the three days, and there have been persistent but unconfirmed reports of a reciprocal visit to Seoul by the North Korean leader in the coming months.</p>
        <p>In a reflection of the huge differences separating the countries, the agenda has been left deliberately vague.</p>
        <p>The South Korean leadership would like to achieve something that lowers military tensions on the peninsula, focusing on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, which have generated anxiety throughout the region. Tensions rose sharply in 1998, for instance, when North Korea made a surprise test launch of a long-range Taepodong 2 missile that flew over the main Japanese island of Honshu.</p>
        <p>For its part, North Korea can be expected to make renewed demands for the withdrawal of the approximately 37,000 American troops based in the South. And after years of disastrous shrinking of its economy following the loss of its Soviet-bloc allies, Pyongyang is also eager to receive a large increase in economic assistance and investment from the far richer South.</p>
        <p>Seoul has already promised large amounts of development assistance in exchange for a real detente. And southern companies, many of whose leaders are flying to Pyongyang in the 130-member presidential delegation, are eager to expand their presence in the north.</p>
        <p>To expand greatly, however, will require new agreements on everything from technology transfer and legal protections from expropriation to monetary exchange and ordinary banking procedures.</p>
        <p>Given the daunting amount of groundwork required in these areas, South Korean officials say privately that they will consider the summit meeting a success if the two sides can announce progress on human issues like the restoration of mail service between the countries, or visits between millions of families separated by the war.</p>
