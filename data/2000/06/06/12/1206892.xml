        <p>The State Assembly is expected to vote today on a bill that would require health insurers to pay hospitals and health care providers more promptly for approved medical services. This is a sound bill that deserves to be approved by both houses of the Legislature. Hospitals frequently have to wrangle with health plans over payment for services provided, and often wait months to be paid. Unjustified delays can create a financial crunch.</p>
        <p>The bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Alexander Grannis, would accelerate the time frames for payment of undisputed claims, and create a dispute resolution system for claims in excess of $500. The losers would bear the costs of the proceedings. Another provision would prohibit insurers from denying payment for medically necessary emergency services because the claim was not reported immediately. The bill would also create a new fund, financed by insurers, to protect providers and consumers with unpaid claims if an insurer went bankrupt.</p>

        <p>The bankruptcy fund proposal may be controversial as negotiations proceed between the Assembly and the Senate on this package. But prompt payment of medical claims has been a tough problem, and some tightening of the rules is needed.</p>
