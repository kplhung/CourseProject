        <p>BEE SEASON  By Myla Goldberg  275 pages. Doubleday. $22.95.</p>
        <p>While it may be true, as Tolstoy famously wrote, that every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way, the unhappiness of the Naumanns in Myla Goldberg's unusual first novel, ''Bee Season,'' seems so particularly original and intriguing that you almost want the author to go on denying the family members the fulfillment they so ardently seek.</p>
        <p>Saul Naumann, the father, is a cantor whose feelings of love for his wife, Miriam, have ebbed ''into gratitude.'' His passion is to retire to his study and read the great Jewish mystics, although he knows that he lacks whatever it takes to achieve true communion with God.</p>
        <p>Miriam, a partner in a law firm, spends her hours at home cleaning and organizing, ''a hummingbird in human form, her wings too fast to be seen without a stop-motion camera.'' Orphaned while in college by a car accident, she seeks to heal herself by occasionally stealing from stores what she thinks of as the missing pieces of her world.</p>
        <p>The Naumanns' oldest child, Aaron, 16, dreams of becoming a rabbi. Inside his father's synagogue ''he is junior class president, football captain and star of the school musical.'' But outside he has few friends and is terrorized by bullies. His 11-year-old sister, Eliza, can't forgive him for failing to resist during a fight she secretly witnessed. She also suffers from feeling less smart than Aaron is, from failing to be picked as he was for her school's talented and gifted program.</p>
        <p>Everything changes when Eliza exercises her talent for spelling. To everyone's surprise, she wins her class, school and district spelling bees and qualifies for the nationals, to be held in Washington.</p>
        <p>Her delighted father pitches in to help her study. He begins by drilling her with Webster's Third International Dictionary. But he sees in her the potential to be what he cannot be, namely a practitioner of the teachings of Abraham Abulafia, a 13th-century cabalist who taught that the key to transcendence is language itself.</p>
        <p>As Saul tells Eliza: ''Abulafia believed that, by concentrating on letters, the mind could loose itself from its shackles to commune with a presence greater than itself, what Abraham Abulafia called shefa, the influx. He believed that barriers separated personal existence from the larger stream of life, the Divine Intellect.'' Eliza, Saul is convinced, can achieve shefa, if properly trained.</p>
        <p>While Eliza is thrilled by her father's attention, Aaron suffers from the loss of it and begins to question his own devotion to Judaism. Concluding that ''he's bought Judaism without consulting the side of the box'' it has come in, he begins to look at other religions and eventually falls in with a Hare Krishna group.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile Miriam steps up her quest for what she calls Perfectimundo, feeling that something is ''growing inside her, waiting for the right moment to make itself known.''</p>
        <p>Eliza, sensitive to these changes in the family dynamic, feels guilty for her part in causing them.</p>
        <p>Ms. Goldberg, who has published short stories in various little magazines, does a sensitive and witty job of plotting the back-and-forth lurches of these seekers after the divine. Aaron, at breakfast on his first overnight at his Hare Krishna temple, ''longs for cereal and not prasadam, has his first pang of homesickness at the thought of Frosted Flakes with sliced banana.'' Miriam longs to match the Perfectimundo implied by a bubble-gum pink Spalding rubber ball.</p>
        <p>As for Eliza, ''her new powers of concentration astound'' her father. ''He laughs to recall a time when she struggled to ignore the sounds of television. He has sneaked up behind her during her chanting and dropped all three volumes of Webster's Universal. She hasn't moved, as far as he can tell not even hearing its unabridged collision with the hard floor.''</p>
        <p>Not everything works in ''Bee Season.'' As eloquently as Eliza's experience is described, there seems something a little forced about equating Abulafia's prescription of language with the chanting of children spelling words like propagate and manicotti and gherkin.</p>
        <p>Faintly off-putting, too, is Ms. Goldberg's adherence to the new form of English in which ''like'' substitutes for ''as if,'' ''different than'' for ''different from,'' ''lay'' for ''lie,'' ''enormity'' for ''enormousness,'' ''disinterest'' for ''uninterest,'' ''access'' for ''get'' and ''a moment in time'' for ''a moment.''</p>
        <p>Still, she keeps her story alive with witty modulations of her characters' feelings. As Eliza approaches the ecstasy of experiencing God, she also the sees practical advantages in her encounter.</p>
        <p>''Shefa will erase years of average report cards, undo seasons of unfulfilled expectations, and legitimize Eliza's new place by her father's side. Shefa will neutralize the guilt she feels when she sits opposite Aaron at the dinner table. Shefa is Eliza's national bee backup plan. . . . With God on her side, the national trophy is as good as in her hands.''</p>
        <p>As mundane and unmystical as these longings of Eliza's may be, you never stop caring about whether she will fulfill them.</p>
