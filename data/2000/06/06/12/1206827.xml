        <p>Dressed in authentic Victorian clothing, members of the Bowler family step inside 50 Elliscombe Road, the 19th-century house in suburban London that will be their home for three months. They have agreed to live there as their ancestors would have -- without telephones, computers, dishwashers (or detergent, shampoo, tampons) -- except their ancestors weren't televised, as the Bowlers will be.</p>
        <p>The house, stripped of all modern trappings and painstakingly refurbished, is a pristine example of turn-of-the-century middle-class propriety. After gasping at the elegance, the family matriarch, Joyce Bowler, says slyly of her new home, ''It's an original, but I'm a fake.''</p>
        <p>With this, the excellent new PBS reality show ''1900 House,'' (which the network is coyly billing as a ''docu-soap''), immediately distinguishes itself from the pack. While capitalizing on our apparently insatiable voyeurism, this British-produced four-part mini-series (which begins tonight) has a sense of humor about itself, a quality noticeably absent from CBS's ''Survivor'' and even from MTV's coltish ''Real World.''</p>
        <p>Another difference: You can emerge from the ''1900 House'' experience with new insight, not only into the obvious (differences between life then and now) but also into the nature of reality itself. Or at least the nature of reality as television presents it these days.</p>
        <p>On ''Survivor,'' which had its premier on May 31, 16 men and women were stranded -- with a camera crew -- on a deserted island. Every week they vote to eject one person. The final ''survivor'' wins $1 million. Later this summer on ''Big Brother,'' CBS installs a group of people in a house under nonstop surveillance. Every week the audience votes someone out, with a half-million-dollar prize to the last remaining tenant.</p>
        <p>On tomorrow's season premiere of ''The Real World'' seven strangers, all young and attractive, move together into a house in New Orleans, where they will spend the next few weeks producing their own cable-access show. Will they get along? Who will sleep with whom?</p>
        <p>The CBS ''Survivor'' Web site, cbs.com/survivor,, which is more interesting and complex than the show itself, does venture a bit of anthropologic theorizing: ''The behavior of B. B. (the 62-year-old real-estate developer who was kicked off the island last week) and Joel closely matched that of Rwanda's Silverback gorillas,'' says one article about two of the island dwellers. ''In every tribe of gorillas one dominant male assumes control. No other male is allowed to mate with the group's female gorillas or lead the group in any way. Through age and infirmity, a dominant male can lose his power.''</p>
        <p>Shows like ''Survivor'' and ''The Real World'' seem most like the audience participation segment at an improvisational theater, performed by amateurs but cleverly packaged by entertainment professionals. By carefully choosing their subjects and settings, the producers can almost predict possible scenarios and edit the material accordingly. Unlike actual reality, which is distressingly random and unedited, these shows fall into a predictable pattern. There will be quarrels, flirtations, danger and revulsion. On ''Survivor,'' bugs have already been eaten.</p>
        <p>What do we learn about the human condition? People apparently enjoy watching other people's pettiness and problems, even when the people themselves aren't all that interesting. The ''Survivor'' ratings, already high, increased for the second show and topped those of the ratings Goliath ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' People (in general and on these shows) in their early 20's are obsessed with themselves and sex: ''The Real World'' entices with the prospect of a good-looking young man who shocks the group by declaring that he intends to remain a virgin until marriage.</p>
        <p>These shows are very different from old reality television, which earnestly believed in truth with a capital T. Most famous was ''An American Family,'' the PBS series -- controversial in the 70's -- which followed the Loud family right through the breakup of the parents' marriage. On the other hand ''Candid Camera'' planted the seeds for ''Survivor,'' by contriving situations in which people could be ''caught in the act of being themselves.''</p>
        <p>''1900 House,'' too, plays to our desire for story and drama, indulging our increasing cultural inability to digest unsweetened information. So the Bowler family undergoes its share of deprivation and reacts with satisfying outbursts of temper and frustration, and subsequent reconciliation and renewal.</p>
        <p>But this series has a larger purpose that it fulfills with great success. The Bowlers know from the outset that the only prize they'll win is knowledge, about the Victorian era and about themselves. There is no cash award. In a clip from the Bowlers' audition interview (they were chosen from more than 400 applicants), Joyce explains that she wants to know if her family is held together by 20th-century technology. Can its members be happy without it?</p>
        <p>Designed as an experiment rather than a contest, ''1900 House'' tries to honor its documentary duty. The producers present not only the family's travails but lots of miscellaneous information about the Victorian era, including the kind of earthy detail Edith Wharton couldn't divulge (about feminine hygiene, for example). A narrator periodically informs us about the hardships: the dearth of hot water for baths, the terrifying rate of infant mortality (one in four children didn't survive past age 6) and household dangers like wallpaper containing arsenic.</p>
        <p>Fashionably, the producers have made the process part of the program. The first episode is devoted to the enormous task of refurbishing the house and choosing the family. This proves to be surprisingly engaging, in part because the man who does much of the explaining -- a social historian named Daru Rooke -- turns out to be perfectly cast. A mild, balding man in his 30's, he's like a good character actor playing a crucial secondary part, the fellow who help moves the plot along. (Such men are valuable in life, too, but appear more frequently on television.)</p>
        <p>During the selection it would become obvious who couldn't stand yesterday's realities. ''If we go more than two weeks without a proper curry, I mean a proper Indian curry, we become very irritable,'' says one of the fathers who wasn't picked.</p>
        <p>A consulting psychologist explains why the Bowlers were chosen: ''They have a sense of adventure, a good sense of humor, and they're also quite comfortable with the camera.''</p>
        <p>All true, but even the good-natured Bowlers will become cranky at times. After their initial infatuation with the house subsides, they learn some hard truths about Victorian life, even for a comfortable middle-class family. The indoor light was gloomy, the food was bland, and people were more pungent because it was so difficult to wash clothes and bodies. And there was an awful lot of family togetherness, too much, perhaps, for people accustomed to the diversions of television, movies, computers and Gameboys.</p>
        <p>Joyce, who dragged her husband and four children into this adventure, emerges as the leading lady. A small, thoughtful 44-year-old, she offers a running commentary on her expectations and disappointments. Her battle with the demands and restrictions on a Victorian woman fulfills both the program's documentary and dramatic needs. The roots of feminism are easy to see.</p>
        <p>Her real struggles with her whalebone corset brought to mind a vivid description from a Louisa May Alcott novel, ''Eight Cousins,'' written in 1875. The heroine is Rose, a young orphan girl being raised by her uncle, a doctor with radical ideas. When he finds out someone has tried to put a corset on the girl, he asks, ''Have you lost your senses that you can for a moment dream of putting a growing girl into an instrument of torture like this?''</p>
        <p>But Joyce's true awakening comes when she decides to hire a maid (who has to agree to abide by the show's rules while working at 50 Elliscombe Road). Thrilled with her new-found freedom (without a machine, the laundry alone consumed three days a week), Joyce goes to the library. She reads about the burgeoning feminist movement and feels at one with the suffragists. But her appeal lies in her self-awareness, as both would-be suffragist and quasi-actress, so she soon feels guilty about having someone else -- a woman no less -- cleaning up after her.</p>
        <p>In an act that seems chivalrous to her, she decides to let the maid go, but is too cowardly to do it in person. She fires her by mail. This shocks and wounds the maid -- who in fact is an actual maid, like her mother and grandmother -- and makes Joyce feel ashamed. This sort of no-win situation feels very real.</p>
        <p>The others have their own problems and pleasures. The husband, Paul, has to shave with a straight razor and the teenage daughter, Kathryn, is overwhelmed by her unshampooed ''dirty, smelly, greasy, skanky'' hair. Nine-year-old Joe refuses to eat almost everything. The 11-year-old twin girls, however, adapt best, concocting theatrical performances with paper-doll puppets and a homemade stage and otherwise amusing themselves.</p>
        <p>In the end, reflecting on their experience, Joyce says she'd like to be able to say the family will change. ''You have to make more time -- more thought -- more time for each other,'' she says. Kathryn, on the other hand, can't wait for the family's first stop after vacating the ''1900 House,'' at Burger King.</p>
        <p>It's easy to sympathize with Kathryn. Maybe soon all of us will reach our saturation point with artificial reality (though the climbing ratings of ''Survivor'' indicate that soon may be later). Maybe after watching ''1900 House'' everyone should turn off the television for a while. Consider the words of the French existentialist Albert Camus, born just after the Victorian age, in 1913.</p>
        <p>''If there is a sin against life,'' wrote Camus, ''it consists perhaps not so much in despairing of life as in hoping for another life and in eluding the implacable grandeur of this life.''</p>
