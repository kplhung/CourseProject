        <p>House Republicans will flesh out their proposal for Medicare drug benefits this week and try to push it through two House committees in three days, despite fierce objections from many Democrats.</p>
        <p>Republicans said today that they would combine their drug plan with a proposal to give more money to health maintenance organizations -- perhaps $4 billion over five years -- in hope of halting the exodus of H.M.O.'s from Medicare.</p>
        <p>In the last two years, H.M.O.'s have pulled out of Medicare, disrupting insurance arrangements for more than 700,000 elderly people, and many more health plans are expected to withdraw this year.</p>
        <p>Documents prepared by senior House Republicans show that they would increase Medicare payments to H.M.O.'s, especially those in rural areas, which now receive the lowest payments.</p>
        <p>Republicans said such increases were needed to keep H.M.O.'s in Medicare and to attract them to markets they have avoided. But some Democrats, like Representative Pete Stark of California, said the increases were unjustified because many health plans were overpaid.</p>
        <p>Under the Republican proposal, the government would subsidize private insurance to cover pharmaceutical costs for Medicare beneficiaries. Such insurance, covering only drug costs, is now unavailable, and insurance companies say they do not intend to sell it, but the Republicans have set aside up to $40 billion over the next five years to buy it.</p>
        <p>A summary of the House Republican plan says the government would guarantee access to drug coverage if private insurers did not offer it. ''All beneficiaries, regardless of where they live, would have the choice of at least two plans, one of which must be a prescription drug plan'' for people in Medicare's original fee-for-service program, the document says.</p>
        <p>Trent D. Duffy, a spokesman for Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said: ''Whether you live in rural Kansas or downtown New York, you will have the option to buy drug coverage. The government would be the insurer of last resort in the unlikely event that private plans are not available.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Duffy said the premiums would probably average $30 to $40 a month. But, Republicans said, premiums, deductibles, co-payments and details of the benefit packages would vary among plans.</p>
        <p>House Republicans said they expected to win approval for their proposal at meetings of the Ways and Means Committee and the Commerce Committee on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. They want the full House to pass it this month, before the Fourth of July recess, to counter Democratic charges that Congress has done nothing on the issue.</p>
        <p>One feature of the House Republican plan is sure to infuriate Clinton administration officials: it would create an agency in the Department of Health and Human Services to administer drug benefits and the H.M.O. program for Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
        <p>The new agency would be known as the Medicare Oversight and Management Administration. Republicans said it was needed because Medicare officials had been biased against H.M.O.'s and had imposed too much regulation on health care providers. The new agency, as envisioned by House Republicans, would have more of a free-market orientation and would encourage private health plans to compete for Medicare business.</p>
        <p>House Republicans acknowledge that drug companies often charge higher prices in the United States than in other countries. But rather than limiting prices here, they would direct the United States trade representative to negotiate with other countries to ''eliminate price controls'' on drugs in Canada and Europe.</p>
        <p>Glen Bolger, a pollster who advises House Republicans on the politics of the prescription drug issue, said: ''It's very important that Republicans stick together and pass a bill. If they don't pass a bill, they'll pay a price at the ballot box.''</p>
        <p>For political purposes, some Republicans said, the fact that they have a plan and are trying to pass it is more important than the content of the plan or whether it actually becomes law.</p>
        <p>Here are details of the House Republican plan, as described in documents obtained from Republican leaders:</p>
        <p>*Medicare beneficiaries would be encouraged to enroll in a drug insurance plan before they became sick. They would initially have six months to enroll. They could change plans once a year, but ''must maintain continuous drug coverage'' through either H.M.O.'s, prescription drug plans or a former employer's health plan.</p>
        <p>*Prescription drug plans would aggressively negotiate with drug companies to secure discounts for Medicare beneficiaries. Insurers would have to cover ''all major therapeutic classes of drugs.''</p>
        <p>*The government would pay premiums and all other costs except modest co-payments -- say, $5 a prescription -- for people with incomes up to 35 percent above the poverty level. The government would provide smaller subsidies for people with incomes from 35 percent to 50 percent above the poverty level. (A couple is classified as poor if it has income less than $11,250 this year.)</p>
        <p>*The government would help insurance companies by paying most of the drug costs incurred by Medicare beneficiaries with the highest costs. An insurance plan with a typical mix of patients would receive a subsidy for 25 percent to 30 percent of all its pharmaceutical costs, ''making insurance more affordable for all beneficiaries.''</p>
        <p>The House Republican bill would increase the basic payments that H.M.O.'s receive for providing services to Medicare beneficiaries. It would also, for the first time, allow H.M.O.'s to negotiate with the government to obtain even more money, if they could prove that their costs justified such payments. The new Medicare agency could grant increases up to a maximum matching the growth of premiums in the private insurance market.</p>
        <p>Private insurance costs have been rising more than twice as fast as Medicare payments to many H.M.O.'s: 4.8 percent a year, as against 2 percent.</p>
        <p>House Republicans will also try to ''recoup government investments in the research and development of prescription drugs,'' their documents say.</p>
        <p>The bill would require drug companies to share some of the profits they reap by exploiting research financed by the National Institutes of Health.</p>
