        <p>It is not, you may be sure, the Bach year to end all Bach years, this 250th anniversary of the composer's death, although it may indeed be the biggest until 2050. In any case it has surely inspired grand gestures: the complete Bach on CD from Teldec; a major festival from Lincoln Center; complete cycles or towering masterworks rendered redundant.</p>
        <p>So there was something appealing about the intimacy as well as the variety of the concert offered by the Mannes Bach Institute on Thursday evening at the Church of the Holy Trinity in Manhattan. The performers were mostly faculty members of the two-week institute, presented by the Mannes College of Music: not all of them, it must be said, Bach or Baroque specialists.</p>

        <p>It is not, you may be sure, the Bach year to end all Bach years, this 250th anniversary of the composer's death, although it may indeed be the biggest until 2050. In any case it has surely inspired grand gestures: the complete Bach on CD from Teldec; a major festival from Lincoln Center; complete cycles or towering masterworks rendered redundant.</p>
        <p>So there was something appealing about the intimacy as well as the variety of the concert offered by the Mannes Bach Institute on Thursday evening at the Church of the Holy Trinity in Manhattan. The performers were mostly faculty members of the two-week institute, presented by the Mannes College of Music: not all of them, it must be said, Bach or Baroque specialists.</p>
        <p>No matter; half of the concert, at least, was wonderful. The Sixth ''Brandenburg'' Concerto, in particular, proved an utter joy. Andre Emelianoff, a cellist, and Martha Stiehl, a harpsichordist, anchored the performance, and Misha Amory and Hsin-Yun Huang, violists, supplied fireworks ever so subtle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Amory is blessedly familiar from his work with the Brentano String Quartet and elsewhere; Ms. Huang, his wife, somewhat less so from her work with the Borromeo String Quartet. But she matched him at every turn here, color for color, and occasionally led a merry chase of her own. The string band was ably filled out by three students.</p>
        <p>This came on the heels of another excellent performance, of the Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor for organ (BWV 582), by Stephen Hamilton. Mr. Hamilton, as minister of music at the church, obviously knew the instrument's sonorous capabilities and brought them powerfully to bear in a rousing account. He took serious risks with accents of duration at one point, lingering on strong beats, but succeeded in enhancing the effect of teeming cumulation that lies at the heart of this work.</p>
        <p>The first half of the program was slower to charm. Mr. Emelianoff, although a fine ensemble musician, proved not quite a master of Bach's Suite for Unaccompanied Cello in E flat (BWV 1010). His tempos seemed unstable, impatient at times, and his tuning tended to falter where it mattered most, in big cadences.</p>
        <p>D'Anna Fortunato, a mezzo-soprano not heard much in New York in the last decade, sang four cantata arias honorably though not quite freshly, her lower notes failing to knit smoothly with the rest of the voice. The greatest satisfaction here was found in obbligato solos: Laura Gilbert's, on flute, and Mr. Amory's.</p>
