        <p>DESPITE the recent sell-off in technology stocks and the steady drumbeat of failing dot-coms, the search for the best high-technology employees continues. And recruiting them still takes extreme measures -- not the least of which is learning the names of potential recruits.</p>
        <p>One ploy currently in vogue -- with many variations on the theme -- has a headhunter call a company, posing as a prospective date who has lost the name and phone number of the nice guy she met at the gym the night before. ''He said he was director of engineering,'' the headhunter confides to the company receptionist, who can't help but oblige by producing a name and extension. In another ruse, a recruiter phones a company's front desk and pretends to be the manager of the new restaurant that just opened up down the street: ''We'd like to send everybody in marketing a gift certificate for a free lunch. Now if I could just get their names.''</p>

        <p>DESPITE the recent sell-off in technology stocks and the steady drumbeat of failing dot-coms, the search for the best high-technology employees continues. And recruiting them still takes extreme measures -- not the least of which is learning the names of potential recruits.</p>
        <p>One ploy currently in vogue -- with many variations on the theme -- has a headhunter call a company, posing as a prospective date who has lost the name and phone number of the nice guy she met at the gym the night before. ''He said he was director of engineering,'' the headhunter confides to the company receptionist, who can't help but oblige by producing a name and extension. In another ruse, a recruiter phones a company's front desk and pretends to be the manager of the new restaurant that just opened up down the street: ''We'd like to send everybody in marketing a gift certificate for a free lunch. Now if I could just get their names.''</p>
        <p>And so goes the race to hire away the best minds of the information technology industry. Even as some dot-com companies hand out pink slips, true high-technology jobs remain a employee's market, with far more jobs than job candidates. Microsoft, which has not let its antitrust travails slow its talent search, currently has 3,000 unfilled positions. Cisco Systems hires 3,000 people every quarter -- if it can find them.</p>
        <p>''From the point of view of companies trying to hire, this has been the worst few years in the history of the planet,'' said John Holman, a San Francisco recruiter. The hardest workers to find are technical ones -- software designers, test engineers, programmers. And start-ups are also plagued by a shortage of managers.</p>
        <p>While demand for workers shows no sign of abating, what has changed recently is what it takes to lure away a new senior-level employee: cash. Stock options, particularly in companies not yet public, have considerably less allure than they did just a few months ago, according to the recruiters helping to craft compensation packages.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, executives changing jobs might have agreed to pay cuts as long as they received plenty of stock options. Now, though, companies are finding they must pay more in salary and options as well as bonuses and other perks.</p>
        <p>Pay for a marketing vice president now runs between $170,000 and $250,000 plus stock options and, often, a bonus. That compares with top salaries of about $150,000 six months ago. And potential employees are scrutinizing companies' financing and management more closely.</p>
        <p>''People would rather go to more established companies,'' said Valerie Frederickson, president of a high-technology recruiting company in Menlo Park, Calif., that bears her name, so they need not worry about when or if a promised initial public stock offering actually happens. ''Employees are getting angry that their companies are delaying their I.P.O.'s.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Frederickson did note that layoffs at smaller Internet companies had helped create a noticeable increase in job candidates in May.</p>
        <p>David Pritchard, Microsoft's head of recruiting, said there was no end in sight to the shortage of workers, though he added that competition from Internet start-ups for new recruits had diminished. ''Given what's been happening in the stock market lately, people are looking a little less at the big payoff that the dot-coms are offering,'' he said. ''When candidates have a competing offer, we tell them to go do some research.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Holman, the recruiter, said he, too, had noticed greater caution on the part of job candidates.</p>
        <p>''Nine months ago, you could say to someone at Hewlett-Packard, 'Sure, we're going to pay you less, but your stock may soon be worth $50 million,' '' Mr. Holman said. ''Now, that same stock looks like it will be worth only $10 million. It's a change in the risk-reward trade-off.''</p>
        <p>Consider Thomas Blanco, who just last month took a job at a publicly traded Internet music company in San Francisco after a year in a telecommunications company and 20 years in banking before that. (He spoke on condition that his current employer not be identified.)</p>
        <p>A human resources director, Mr. Blanco had considered a competing offer from an Internet start-up that planned to go public soon but decided the risk was not worth it. Had he been making the move a few months earlier, before the Nasdaq's dive in April, he said his decision might have been different. ''I knew that the number of I.P.O.'s from here on would be smaller,'' Mr. Blanco said.</p>
        <p>To lure new hires, companies continue to add perks, including catered dinners. In a recent survey by Deloitte &amp; Touche of chief executives at high-technology companies, a quarter said they offered their employees free meals at work. Six percent said they allowed employees to bring pets to work. Other flourishes included in-house gyms, dry cleaning and even flu shots.</p>
        <p>But few things beat more money. Back in February, Microsoft's management in Redmond, Wash., raised salaries in the company's Silicon Valley operations 15 percent across-the-board. That move came after Microsoft concluded that it would otherwise be unable to compete in the Northern California job market, where housing costs and living expenses were far higher than in Washington.</p>
        <p>And in April, Microsoft's president, Steven A. Ballmer, announced a new companywide stock option program. The hope was to bolster the confidence of current employees and attract new ones in light of both the lower stock price and the vagaries of the government's intention to split the company.</p>
        <p>But Nasdaq uncertainty is not scaring everyone away from start-ups. Michael Marrow, an executive with more than 10 years experience in providing outsourced customer service, recently signed on as chief operating officer of a new company called ShipServ, which plans to develop an e-commerce marketplace for the deep-sea shipping industry. He turned down more lucrative offers in order to ''create something that has not been created before,'' he said, despite the fact that other dot-coms were facing layoffs and delayed stock offerings.</p>
        <p>''I'm not a 25-year-old programmer,'' Mr. Marrow said. ''I know there are not guarantees, that the payoff may be further down the road.''</p>
        <p>For many, joining a start-up is still considered boot camp for managing larger companies. In fact, Ms. Frederickson said some of her clients in large, established corporations would consider only candidates with some experience at companies before they went public. ''You have to get your ticket punched at a pre-I.P.O. company or you don't get any respect,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The difference now, she says, is job candidates may want more cash along with the respect.</p>
