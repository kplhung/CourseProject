        <p>HUANG-John, M.D. On June 11, 2000 we lost our dearest friend. His life, tragically cut short, was filled with accomplishments of many lifetimes. Valedictorian Bronx High 1974, summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa Haverford College 1978, high honors Tufts Medical School 1982, most recently New York Law School. He outshined all around him with his quick wit, deep empathy, keen mind, and decency. His greatest achievements were in his devotion to family. His loss leaves a void which will never be filled-yet his light will shine forever in the hearts of his wonderful two sons. To his wife Mabel, and sons Michael and David, we wish comfort and peace. Mark, Karen, Josh and Adam Bodner</p>
