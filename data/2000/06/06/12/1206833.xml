        <p>The piece, performed by American Ballet Theater on Wednesday afternoon and evening at the Metropolitan Opera House, is a long journey through academic ballet training.

        <p>Harald Lander's ''Etudes'' ought to be required viewing for anyone who believes that the current film ''Center Stage'' presents an accurate picture of a life in ballet.</p>
        <p>The piece, performed by American Ballet Theater on Wednesday afternoon and evening at the Metropolitan Opera House, is a long journey through academic ballet training. Spectacular, cornball and dull in turn, the ballet progresses from the most basic steps performed by the smallest of small fry to demanding sequences performed by those who have mastered not just the steps but also the physical and spiritual discipline the art demands.</p>
        <p>The evening's lead cast -- Irina Dvorovenko, Jose Manuel Carreno and Vladimir Malakhov -- stood out on the whole for the glitter of its performing. In the afternoon the emphasis was more on expansiveness and simplicity in a performance headed by Amanda McKerrow, Marcelo Gomes and Maxim Belotserkovsky. Ms. Dvorovenko's dancing had a weight that made it regal. Ms. McKerrow was delicately lyrical. Lander did not allow for much pyrotechnical ornamentation, and both Mr. Carreno and Mr. Malakhov looked uncharacteristically subdued. The greatest beauty of their dancing was their contrasting qualities. If Mr. Carreno could be said to be earth, Mr. Malakhov is air.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon Mr. Gomes stood out for his big, unforced approach to classical technique. Like Ms. Dvorovenko, Mr. Belotserkovsky has a more forceful Russian-style attack, mixed here, characteristically, with a winning clarity of line and shape. The score, composed by Knudaage Riisager and based on Czerny etudes, was conducted at both performances by David Lamarche.</p>
        <p>The matinee performance also included Mr. Malakhov's role debut in Martha Graham's ''Diversion of Angels,'' dancing with Sandra Brown as half of the Couple in Red. The purest of classicists, Mr. Malakhov has obviously paid close and devoted attention to the distinctive shapes and propulsive quality of the Graham modern-dance technique.</p>
        <p>His is somewhat airy Graham dancing, but that quality of devotion keeps him sufficiently tethered to the earth. Isaac Stappas, who danced the Fourth Man, looked as if he had been born dancing Graham, in a fine lead cast completed by Stella Abrera, Mr. Gomes, Erica Cornejo and Herman Cornejo.</p>
