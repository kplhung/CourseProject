        <p>THEY are moving toward Islanders territory, having roared right through the Rangers' domain.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey Devils were not necessarily going to get their due merely for winning a second Stanley Cup in six seasons, gained in the wee small hours of yesterday morning, with millions of captivated fans and strangers paying rapt attention.</p>
        <p>Then at the end, the Devils hoisted above their shaggy, sweaty heads the grandest sporting trophy in North America, the Stanley Cup.</p>
        <p>But, oh, the way the Devils did it, struggling in two straight epic games, one a loss in the third overtime Thursday night and then the victory on the road, beating the Dallas Stars, 2-1.</p>
        <p>The Devils never wanted to cut it this fine, but what they lost in suffering they will gain in fame. In two straight gripping games, they gave viewers compelling overtimes with no commercial timeouts, gripping back-and-forth hockey that anybody could appreciate.</p>
        <p>The Devils are now in their own category. If the old Dodgers of urban Brooklyn were the Boys of Summer (courtesy of the writer Roger Kahn) and the Islanders of the suburbs were the Boys of Winter, then the Devils are now the Boys of Midnight.</p>
        <p>They flew home yesterday afternoon and deposited the Stanley Cup in the foyer of their arena, looking surprisingly refreshed for men who had played a long and terrifying game the night before. They had come somewhat farther than the distance between Dallas and New Jersey. They had now traveled into dynasty country.</p>
        <p>It is not exactly true that the Devils operate in a vacuum. Hockey people have known, even before that 1995 Stanley Cup, that Lou Lamoriello runs a good ship -- a little secretive, a little frugal, a little tense, but a sound ship nonetheless. Lamoriello was not afraid to ship out players who did not want to play at his prices, but he knew enough to recognize keepers -- Ken Daneyko, Martin Brodeur, Scott Stevens, the backbone.</p>
        <p>The real insult for the Devils, just as it was for the Islanders, has been the anonymity conferred on them by playing in the suburbs. The Islanders won four straight Stanley Cups from 1980 through 1983, one of the best New York teams ever for character and skill, but they never knew the thrill of riding through the Wall Street canyons and hearing the roars. When they won, it was Hempstead Turnpike and a parking lot.</p>
        <p>The Rangers won one stinking Stanley Cup in 1994 and the celebration was so great you would have thought somebody had finally fixed all the broken parking meters.</p>
        <p>The Rangers had the mystique and the Islanders had their Stanley Cups, but all the Devils had was the Mickey Mouse label hung on them by that raging motormouth of controversy, Wayne Gretzky.</p>
        <p>They can hang up the mouse ears permanently. What with free agency and international scouting, it is harder than ever to put up a hockey dynasty. All of us of a certain age lament when the Montreal Canadiens were automatic finalists, but it's not going to happen anymore.</p>
        <p>''Everyone says the first cup is the most difficult -- and it is, until you do it,'' Lamoriello said. ''But I say the second one is more difficult because you are expected to win every year.''</p>
        <p>On Thursday night the Devils wanted to clinch at home for their loyal fans with red and black draped and slathered all over them, but the Devils frittered away a third-period power play and ultimately lost at 46 minutes 21 seconds of overtime. They were not the resourceful Islanders, not that night.</p>
        <p>However, on Saturday night, fighting to avoid a seventh game, the Devils came up with their own heroes, their own images. There was Jason Arnott, playing the role of Bob Nystrom (the Islanders' overtime hero of the first cup), scoring the winning goal at 8:21 of the fifth period. And there was Larry Robinson, the stalwart Hall of Fame defender, now the coach, pulling on the No. 17 jersey of his wounded forward, Petr Sykora, during the celebration on the ice.</p>
        <p>These visions, flickering in dens and bedrooms and bars wherever hockey is shown, propelled these Devils into a higher league. Even Lamoriello had a sense that his dour, competent franchise had touched some nerves.</p>
        <p>''The way it's been done,'' he said yesterday, back home. ''The interest of the people. It's been tremendous for hockey, and great for our area.''</p>
        <p>Lamoriello, who is not prone to gush, added: ''For us to go on the road and take the Stanley Cup away from the defending champions is just great. It was a great battle, and it could have gone either way.''</p>
        <p>He praised Robinson, who replaced the high-strung Robbie Ftorek with eight games left in the regular season, and he praised his young players, but mostly he praised the nine players who remain from that 1995 season.</p>
        <p>''Very seldom do you see so many players stay around that long,'' Lamoriello said.</p>
        <p>Now the public has put a face next to the name. Daneyko's battered mug. Stevens's gunfighter eyes. Brodeur's smile. Bobby Holik's intensity. And the nastiness of Claude Lemieux, digging in his skates, sending a shower of ice chips into the opposing goalie's mask just for the meanness of it.</p>
        <p>These guys were slow to captivate the area, almost never selling out a game, but they have gotten everybody's attention with those extra periods, those bonus hours, those Peril-of-Pauline stands in the goal mouth.</p>
        <p>Now the team is being sold by John McMullen to a chap named Steinbrenner, who is known for rebuilding the Yankees. The new owner may want to remember that the Devils are Stanley Cup champions, with a whole new cadre of fans who can only hope he does not mess up what has been handed to him, a contemporary dynasty of sorts, the Boys of Midnight.</p>
