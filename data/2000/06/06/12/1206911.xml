        <p>Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the largest health insurer in New York State, cannot earn enough money to survive if it remains a nonprofit company. But state authorities have dawdled over its application to convert to for-profit status for nearly four years, and the Legislature threatens to exit Albany without approving Empire's request.</p>
        <p>Empire used to be the only insurer to extend coverage to all individual applicants -- those not covered through employers -- at rates that did not depend on the applicant's medical condition. But since 1996, the state has required every managed care plan to enroll individuals. Empire's special role ceased. The only way to preserve Empire's contribution to the uninsured is to approve the conversion. Empire would turn over all of its stock, worth perhaps $600 million, to an independent foundation. The foundation would later sell the stock, using the proceeds to help extend coverage to the uninsured. Empire would then issue new stock to pay for the information systems and other hugely expensive investments that are needed to match those of for-profit plans.</p>

        <p>Empire used to be the only insurer to extend coverage to all individual applicants -- those not covered through employers -- at rates that did not depend on the applicant's medical condition. But since 1996, the state has required every managed care plan to enroll individuals. Empire's special role ceased. The only way to preserve Empire's contribution to the uninsured is to approve the conversion. Empire would turn over all of its stock, worth perhaps $600 million, to an independent foundation. The foundation would later sell the stock, using the proceeds to help extend coverage to the uninsured. Empire would then issue new stock to pay for the information systems and other hugely expensive investments that are needed to match those of for-profit plans.</p>
        <p>Nonprofit plans are struggling across the country. The simple fact is Empire cannot provide enrollees high-quality service unless it can raise capital. The state's insurance superintendent supports conversion. So does Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general. Four years is long enough to wait for something that benefits Empire's four million enrollees and has widespread approval among the state authorities in charge of protecting the public interest.</p>
