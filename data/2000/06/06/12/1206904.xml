        <p>Perhaps it is the tedium of watching the grass grow just to cut it down and watch it grow some more. Perhaps it's just something about men and their motors. No one seems to know why it is happening now. But all across America, men have discovered new thrills at the throttle of the snail of gasoline-powered locomotion, the riding lawn mower.</p>
        <p>From Bergholz, N.Y., to Buda, Tex., from Troy, Ohio, and Stillwater, Okla., to Cut Bank, Mont., Damascus, Ore., and this brawny town across the Missouri River from Bismarck, men and the rare woman are off to the races on souped-up, decal-coated John Deeres, Snappers, Dynamarks and Murrays. Some as stocky as their machines themselves, they whip around dirt tracks at speeds routinely exceeding 30 miles an hour and sometimes 60.</p>

        <p>Perhaps it is the tedium of watching the grass grow just to cut it down and watch it grow some more. Perhaps it's just something about men and their motors. No one seems to know why it is happening now. But all across America, men have discovered new thrills at the throttle of the snail of gasoline-powered locomotion, the riding lawn mower.</p>
        <p>From Bergholz, N.Y., to Buda, Tex., from Troy, Ohio, and Stillwater, Okla., to Cut Bank, Mont., Damascus, Ore., and this brawny town across the Missouri River from Bismarck, men and the rare woman are off to the races on souped-up, decal-coated John Deeres, Snappers, Dynamarks and Murrays. Some as stocky as their machines themselves, they whip around dirt tracks at speeds routinely exceeding 30 miles an hour and sometimes 60.</p>
        <p>''This is going to go over big time if somebody doesn't get killed,'' said Larry Freisz, 61, a fan at the races around a 480-foot dirt track at the Dacotah Speedway here on Saturday. Poking along at four or five miles an hour in the solitude of the prairie west of Mandan, Mr. Freisz mows five acres of grass around his home, so he was taken by the speed of the machines here.</p>
        <p>''Those two mowers over there?'' Mr. Freisz said. ''They're just like mosquitoes. They're here and they're gone.''</p>
        <p>The racing inspires puns. ''The mow the merrier,'' the United States Lawn Mower Racing Association advertises, in the ''mowdowns'' of the ''mowlennium.'' A group in Ohio calls itself the Dewberry Mudboggers, and one in Alabama, the Dixie Outlaws.</p>
        <p>Although the mowers' blades are removed, these machines still have a modicum of menace. Somebody might indeed get killed. Through their trade association, the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute, in Alexandria, Va., the companies that produce 1.6 million riding lawn mowers a year will have nothing to do with racing and have adopted a resolution opposing it. ''We're concerned with the use of the equipment as it was manufactured to be used,'' said William G. Harley, president of the institute.</p>
        <p>Here, 40-year-old Richard Bohlman, operations director of a medical center 200 miles away in Tioga, won the biggest event, with eight men starting and four finishing the 20 laps. The instant Mr. Bohlman crossed the line, his mower threw a rear wheel. The machine flipped, pitching Mr. Bohlman, who weighs about 250 pounds, 15 feet in the air. He seemed to hover there spread-eagled, then landed on his side in the dirt. Ashen and aching, he walked away.</p>
        <p>Like stock car racing, a decades-old institution in many suburban and rural communities, lawn mower racing is becoming a regular sport. Local newspapers report the results. Local businesses sponsor many of the racers. Races in Stillwater draw thousands of fans; the one here drew 200. Evidently starting in the late 1980's as a Fourth of July event on wide subdivision streets, contenders are now organizing circuits, scheduling weekend races town to town.</p>
        <p>Donald Gienger, a machinist at an Ingersoll-Rand factory in Bismarck, formed the North Dakota Lawn Mower Racing Association only last year. He drew six drivers to its first race, in Mandan. On Saturday, 12 showed up for the first of six events scheduled across the state so far this year. Thirty racers have signed up for one on July 4 in Wildrose, N.D., population 193. Other circuits have formed in Georgia, Alabama, Oklahoma, Texas, Washington State and upstate New York.</p>
        <p>Lawn mower racing's biggest boost has come from the Gold Eagle Company in Chicago, which makes a gasoline additive called Sta-bil. Eight years ago, Gold Eagle executives formed the United States Lawn Mower Racing Association to promote Sta-bil. The association now claims 500 member racers for whom it has organized more than 20 regional events this year, the most ever, and a national championship in Mendota, Ill., on Labor Day. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, more racers belong to groups, just a year or two old, unaffiliated with the association.</p>
        <p>One secret of the racing's growth is its economics. To enter, contestants pay a small fee, $15 or $25. There are no purses and typically no betting. ''We have no desire for filthy lucre,'' said Larry Sandoval, 62, who edits the newsletter of a racing group in Stillwater. Bruce Kaufman, a public relations man and president of the national association, said, ''We race for trophies, bragging rights and glory.''</p>
        <p>More important, the mowers are cheap, opening a vast new horizon for the adrenaline-enriched and mechanically inclined. Racing mowers cost a fraction of the $10,000 or $20,000 spent to buy and prepare a stock car racer.</p>
        <p>Most are long-retired machines that racers rebuild to meet four or five levels of classification, from stock racers that still cut grass, but race with blades removed, to ''factory experimental'' machines on which the platforms intended to cover the blades are strictly decorative.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bohlman, who had the accident here, said that one of his two racers is 28 years old. ''My uncle bought it for me when I was 12 to mow the grass on my grandfather's farm,'' he said. Long after, ''I dug it out of a rock pile'' and fixed it up for racing.</p>
        <p>Wayne Storick, a 35-year-old contract laborer, bought his mower for $100. ''I cut my grass with it and then tore it apart,'' he said. ''I put a centrifugal clutch in it'' so he doesn't have to shift gears. ''I made my own intake manifold and cam shaft.'' He installed an external oil pump and brakes from a snowmobile.</p>
        <p>''I've always liked working with engines,'' said Mark Steinwand, 33. ''I like making stuff go as fast at it can.'' A machine operator at the Ingersoll-Rand plant, Mr. Steinwand bought his mower from a farmer last August. ''He pulled it out of his tree rows. I got three lawn mowers from him. I gave him $50 for all three.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gienger, the machinist, who owns four mowers, said: ''They're the guys who always wanted to race and couldn't afford to. If they missed their call for professional racing, this is their venue.''</p>
        <p>Any silliness to the notion of racing a riding lawn mower evaporates as a race approaches.</p>
        <p>In Mandan this weekend, grim-faced men donned the required safety apparel -- long-sleeved shirts, long pants, gloves, over-the-ankle boots and full-face helmets. On their machines, each had a switch, to be tethered to their belts, to stop the motor if they fell or were thrown. Racers cannot drug their machines with speed-inducing additives.</p>
        <p>On the announcer's command, ''On your mark, get set, get ready, mow!'' they dashed to their machines and roared off. Round and round they went, hunching over their steering wheels. Thundering into turns, they hiked out their bodies barely touching their seats, from one side, then the other. Lean, lanky younger men had the edge in maneuvering and dodging, the bigger men in keeping their wheels down.</p>
        <p>In all four races, machines spun into the center and returned, or died with dropped chains and burst engines. ''The big men won,'' said Mr. Gienger, who, with Mr. Bohlman, was one of them.</p>
        <p>Then came the tamer, double-elimination one-on-one drag races, and another close call. Wayne Schultz, 34, a farmer from Streeter, Okla., 90 miles east of Mandan, had finished third in his class in the earlier race.</p>
        <p>In the first heat of the drag, he lost to Donovan Hoffer, 27, a heavy-equipment operator from Bismarck. With the flash of orange lights starting the second, Mr. Schultz's mower did a wheelie, leaping up on its rear wheels. But instead of folding back down on him, still in the seat, it stood there upended, and Mr. Schultz walked away.</p>
        <p>''You really got to be a good defensive driver,'' Mr. Gienger said. ''You have to be very level-headed about it. There's a huge level of risk.''</p>
