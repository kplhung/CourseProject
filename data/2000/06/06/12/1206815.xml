        <p>''Fierce Campaigns Signal a New Era for State Courts'' (front page, June 5) raises a more fundamental question: Why should judges be elected in the first place? The founding fathers understood the need for an independent judiciary when they gave life tenure to federal judges.</p>

        <p>''Fierce Campaigns Signal a New Era for State Courts'' (front page, June 5) raises a more fundamental question: Why should judges be elected in the first place? The founding fathers understood the need for an independent judiciary when they gave life tenure to federal judges.</p>
        <p>Under our separation of powers, judges should protect minorities and those who hold minority views against the whims of the majority.  The views of the ''majority'' are legitimately heard by the legislative and executive branches.</p>
        <p>Criminal defendants and private litigants deserve a tribunal that decides cases by impartially applying the law to the facts, not with an eye to the next election or how a decision will play in an opponent's attack ad. Incompetent or unethical judges can be weeded out through a nonpolitical oversight board.</p>
