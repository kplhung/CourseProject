        <p>Take a great company like American Ballet Theater, give it a piece of fluff like ''The Taming of the Shrew'' in John Cranko's ingenious dance treatment, and you have a terrific piece of escape entertainment.</p>
        <p>Among ballets for the tired businessman, this ''Shrew,'' first seen in New York in 1969 with the Stuttgart Ballet, has held pride of place. There were lots of laughs as Cranko's Petruchio and his Kate tripped each other up in pratfalls and were entangled in hammerlocks. Except for its bravura duets, the choreography got by on a great deal of sleight of hand, or foot.</p>
        <p>But on Friday night at the Metropolitan Opera House when Ballet Theater performed ''The Taming of the Shrew'' for the first time, the work appeared reborn. Alessandra Ferri and Julio Bocca were sensational as a tantrum-prone Katherina and a jaunty Petruchio. The company performed with the same brilliance, energizing the ensemble on a level one doesn't recall from other productions.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ferri and Mr. Bocca channeled their fiery dramatic temperaments into comic acting, slapstick and even dancing. The paradox is that sheer dance power from all concerned carried a ballet short on complex dance elements. If this production comes across more strongly than expected, it is thanks to the staging of Reid Anderson and Jane Bourne, but also to the projection that Ballet Theater provides through the force of its technique.</p>
        <p>When the Stuttgart made its triumphant New York debut in 1969, Richard Cragun and Marcia Haydee took to the tosses and lifts of Cranko's high-flying Soviet-style duets with fearlessness and flair. Unlike anyone else, Mr. Cragun could execute triple turns in the air.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bocca remains satisfied with the usual double air turns, but his overall technique puts him on a higher level and he gives his dancing and acting a transformatory power. Like his drunk act in ''The Merry Widow,'' his tipsy Petruchio goes beyond cliche through the forcefulness of his movement, echoed later in the onrush of leaps and whizzing turns that are among his trademarks.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ferri is a bit cautious in the duets: the tosses are low. But from the moment she stamps on stage in her harridan act, she throws herself fully into her role and brings out its emotional nuances. The lily-swatting reluctant bride married off to the highest bidder becomes a tender spouse who never loses her own temper.</p>
        <p>Like the best of vaudeville comics Ms. Ferri and Mr. Bocca are a perfect team. The scene in which Petruchio starves his new wife into submission is funny rather than offensive. They make every grab for a drumstick and every wrestling hold part of a clearly developing relationship. They won't need a marriage counselor. The understanding between the two dancers is so complete that they can make falling off a wooden horse seem significant rather than just a crossover sequence during a set change.</p>
        <p>The scenery, in fact, comes from the National Ballet of Canada, where a Canadian, Susan Benson, has designed new sets and costumes. These are similar in concept to the originals at Stuttgart by Elizabeth Walton, keeping a two-tier Renaissance arched structure, adding a fine and occasionally impressionistic style. Kurt-Heinz Stolze's arrangement of compositions by Domenico Scarlatti, conducted exuberantly by David Briskin, still provides the right period-piece flavor. Robert Thomson's  lighting adds to the merriment.</p>
        <p>Cranko's adaptation of Shakespeare's play makes skillful use of theatrical symbols to replace words. Ashley Tuttle, engaging and sweet as Bianca, Katherina's sister, is wooed by three suitors. Joaquin De Luz, in plumes and turquoise, shows a new side of his stage personality as a very funny fop, Hortensio; he gives Bianca a fan. Vladislav Kalinin, marvelous as Gremio, becomes a doddering dolt without overdoing anything; he gives her a glove. As Lucentio, Marcelo Gomes looks more alive than ever onstage in his comic timing and virile nobility; he gives Bianca a rose and dances the lyric duets with her.</p>
        <p>By contrast the uninhibited antics of Cheryl Madeux and Michele Wiles as two whores, of Brian Reeder as a priest and of Ethan Brown as an exasperated patriarch are low comedy, expertly put across.</p>
        <p>The corps members, streaming out in nightclothes to rail at Katherina's tantrums, or as revelers at a carnival and aristocrats at a ball, have a lot of silly time prancing and wiggling. The first of the ballet's two acts is stronger. But the beauty of the staging is the opportunity it gives so many dancers to shine as the individuals they are. Its success is a welcome surprise and one looks forward to other casts next week, from June 19 to 22.</p>
