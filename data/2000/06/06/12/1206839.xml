        <p>Following an exciting semifinal that resulted in the elimination of the top-ranked team, groups led by George Jacobs and Richard Schwartz faced each other yesterday in the final of the International Team Trials in Memphis. At stake was the right to represent the United States in the World Championships in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in August.</p>
        <p>Nick Nickell, Dick Freeman, Bob Hamman, Paul Soloway, Jeff Meckstroth and Eric Rodwell, who own bunches of world and national titles, were exempt until the 120-deal semifinal, played on Friday and Saturday. They began badly, trailing by 59 imps after the first 15 deals against Jacobs, Ralph Katz, Howard Weinstein, Steve Garner, David Berkowitz and Larry Cohen. They fought back and had a one-imp lead going into the final 15-deal segment, but the Jacobs team snatched a 7-imp victory and advanced.</p>
        <p>In the other semifinal the Schwartz team, consisting of Drew Casen, Bobby Levin, Steve Weinstein, Zia Mahmood and Michael Rosenberg, overwhelmed a group headed by Rose Johnson-Meltzer, winning by 102. Forty-eight hours earlier the Schwartz team had struggled to defeat a highly talented junior squad.</p>
        <p>The diagramed deal helped the Jacobs team build its lead in the first half of the semifinal. Most players with the South hand would double an opening bid of one diamond by East, but Nickell chose a gentle overcall of one heart. He eventually reached the normal three no-trump contract and Cohen, West, led the diamond deuce.</p>
        <p>East played the nine, and South won with the ace and led the club jack for a finesse. Berkowitz, East, allowed this to win, a fine play that greatly diminished South's chances of using dummy's clubs. A second club finesse lost to the queen, and East led the diamond jack. This was ducked, and East continued with the queen.</p>
        <p>South gave up a spade and a club from the dummy. He won with the king, and the fate of the contract was in the balance. He cashed the spade ace and finessed the jack. This was not likely to succeed, in view of the opening bid, and when it lost to the queen, he was doomed.</p>
        <p>There was a difficult line of play that would have saved the day. The play of the diamond suit strongly suggested that East held the 10 and West the eight. Instead of playing the spade ace, South should have cashed his heart winners and led the diamond four, throwing the spade 10 from the dummy.</p>
        <p>After winning, East would have to lead a spade. South would win in the dummy, lead the club king and discard his spade ace. East and dummy would be reduced to black cards, and South would make nine tricks.</p>
        <p>In the replay Hamman, East, did not find the play of holding up his club queen. South was subsequently able to overtake the 10 with the king, making his game, and the Jacobs team gained 11 imps.</p>
