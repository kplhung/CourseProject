        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report that ''the United States falls behind almost every country in Europe as well as Canada, Australia and Israel in what the World Health Organization calls 'healthy life expectancy' '' (news article, June 5). This should not come as a surprise.</p>
        <p>The United States does not have a national health plan, and many elderly people (and not so elderly) can barely make ends meet, let alone buy health insurance. There is no reason that the richest country in the world cannot provide medical care for all who live here.</p>

        <p>We must also examine the ridiculous work ethic forced upon us. We are expected to work a great deal of overtime (often without pay) and have to be happy with two weeks of vacation. In many of the countries mentioned, four to six weeks is standard.</p>
