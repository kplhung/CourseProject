        <p>After six weeks of marching up stairs and knocking on doors, an army of census takers has surpassed the Census Bureau's efforts in 1990 and nearly completed the agency's task of accounting for New Yorkers who did not complete their mail-in forms this spring, the Census Bureau said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The census takers, called enumerators, still have to pound on tens of thousands of doors and prod people into providing detailed and personal questionnaires for the bureau to account accurately for New York City's residents. And census officials said many of those who remained unaccounted for -- residents who declined to mail back census questionnaires, refused to answer their doors or otherwise have been inaccessible -- will be among the toughest to reach.</p>
        <p>But as of Saturday night, six weeks into the 10-week, door-to-door campaign, enumerators had completed their work at 91.7 percent of the 1,647,931 households the agency had selected in the city's five boroughs. Tony Farthing, New York regional director of the Census Bureau, estimated that about 70 percent of households had been reached at this time in the last census.</p>
        <p>''I was here in 1990, and that was a nightmare,'' said Mr. Farthing, who in 1990 headed census operations in Brooklyn. ''We still have to finish, but it's nice to be in this position. We have three and a half more weeks to get such a small percentage done.''</p>
        <p>The results in New York mirror national figures released last week by Kenneth Prewitt, the director of the census, who said enumerators had accounted for 93 percent of 42 million households nationwide, about 20 percentage points better than in 1990.</p>
        <p>The Census Bureau's door-to-door work follows a high-profile $167 million national advertising campaign seeking to persuade a skeptical public to fill out the bureau's questionnaires and to halt a three-decade slide in mail response rates. In New York and other cities where tens of thousands were missed in the 1990 census, the bureau also relied on an ambitious plan that counted on churches, grass-roots organizations, immigrant rights groups and local politicians to urge city residents to cooperate.</p>
        <p>The result, census officials said, was that by the end of April, 53 percent of the city's households had returned their forms, a percentage that matched the 1990 response rate for that period.</p>
        <p>Employing 25,000 part-time enumerators, the Census Bureau then embarked on reaching the rest, and has now completed visits to 97.4 percent of the selected households in the Bronx, 93.4 percent in Brooklyn, 92.4 percent on Staten Island and 91 percent in Manhattan. Queens remained last, with 87.1 percent of selected households accounted for, a showing that the bureau attributed to the  high number of new immigrants in the borough who might fear contact with a government agency, despite the bureau's promise of confidentiality.</p>
        <p>Exact data for the corresponding period in 1990 was not available to compare accurately the bureau's efforts from this census with the last. But Mr. Farthing said he expected 18 of the bureau's 22 census offices in New York City to finish enumerating by June 23. In 1990, census takers from 17 offices were still counting as the 10-week enumeration period came to a close.</p>
        <p>While census officials were hailing this year's work, they acknowledged that accounting for those yet to be reached would be extremely difficult. Experts said many of those who remained were likely to be illegal immigrants, fugitives from the law or others who wanted nothing to do with the government.</p>
        <p>''The ones they've gotten so far are ones where they found somebody there, and the person was willing to talk,'' said Andrew A. Beveridge, a Queens College sociology professor who analyzes census data and closely follows the agency. ''As you do repeats, those people become harder and harder and harder to find.''</p>
        <p>Even in the Bronx, where the census has been most successful, enumerators have found their work full of obstacles.</p>
        <p>Some residents of new housing blocks that have sprouted in once-blighted communities have refused to buzz in census takers who arrived at the gates in front of their homes, said Christopher Bell, assistant manager of field operations for the bureau's satellite office responsible for the southwest Bronx.</p>
        <p>At the Mitchell Houses on Alexander Avenue, one enumerator was chased down a hallway by an irate resident. And at the Daniel Webster Houses on Webster Avenue, extending from 168th to 169th Street, safety became a factor because enumerators were scared off by young men who told them to leave, Mr. Bell said.</p>
        <p>''New York City housing developments, in general, historically have people who are disenfranchised,'' said Mr. Bell, who lives in the South Bronx. ''It's a hard life on people there, and they have to take it out on someone. And we're the federal government.''</p>
        <p>No one has been hurt, he said, and the bureau has responded by returning time and time again, trying to urge people to open their doors. ''Safety was a big factor,'' Mr. Bell said. ''We go there very cautiously, and we go there in numbers. We want to send four or five people at a time.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, several residents of the Webster Houses, a five-building project in one of the poorest stretches of the city, said some of their neighbors were fearful of opening their doors to strangers. ''I wouldn't open the door to someone I'm not expecting,'' said Ormesinda Isaac, 78, who mailed in her census questionnaire months ago. ''These days, you can't do that.''</p>
        <p>Joseph Dechamps, 82, the president of the tenants association at 420 East 169th Street, one of the Webster buildings, speculated that many of those who did not open their doors to census workers were subletting illegally or not listed on the city housing rolls.</p>
        <p>Yet, Mr. Dechamps, a retired factory worker, and others said the Census Bureau could have done better.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dechamps, for instance, said he was never asked by census workers to reach out to other residents. ''I would have helped them out,'' he said. ''I would have been glad to help.'' And Jamel Smith, 21, scoffed at assertions that the Webster development was dangerous. ''They don't knock on doors,'' he said. ''We saw them walk by. They walk by every Sunday, but they haven't come by here.''</p>
        <p>For the bureau, getting as accurate a count as possible is crucial. In 1990, the agency accounted for nearly 97 percent of the city's population. But while that figure sounds impressive, it amounted to missing 240,000 New Yorkers, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars in federal and state aid. Nationwide, the undercount was 4.7 million people, about 1.8 percent of the population.</p>
        <p>Still, census officials are feeling buoyant as the latest results come in from the door-to-door efforts -- and pondering why resident response has varied from neighborhood to neighborhood, borough to borough.</p>
        <p>The diversity of Queens, where new immigrants have poured into Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, Astoria and other areas, is believed to be a leading factor in the borough's last-place standing in this year's door-to-door campaign. On Staten Island, census officials thought their work would be complete because of the relatively small size of the workload, only 71,767 households, compared to, say, Brooklyn, with 527,274. Mr. Farthing said he believed that enumerators on Staten Island have been ineffective.</p>
        <p>In the Bronx, which exceeded the expectations of bureau officials, several factors contributed to census takers' success. Politicians, from the borough president, Fernando Ferrer, to state and local officials, held meetings with residents and urged community groups to educate people in their neighborhoods about the census, bureau officials said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, organizations as divergent as the Gambian Society on Jerome Avenue and Sacred Heart Church on 168th Street sent volunteers into the streets and into apartment buildings, where residents were told about the importance of the census to their communities.</p>
        <p>''We asked questions; we answered questions,'' said Michelle Fox Peterson, an organizer for the South Bronx Churches Morrisania Cluster, which operates low-income buildings in the Bronx. ''We directed people where to get their census forms. We found there were people who didn't know about the census, were misinformed. We assured them.''</p>
