        <p>While the recent rise in job openings in the humanities is heartening, it is premature to describe college teaching as ''a hot career in a hot job market.'' A 1999 study shows that only half those seeking tenured positions in English had actually achieved them after 10 years.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Higher Degrees of Occupation'' (Workplace section, June 7):</p>
        <p>While the recent rise in job openings in the humanities is heartening, it is premature to describe college teaching as ''a hot career in a hot job market.'' A 1999 study shows that only half those seeking tenured positions in English had actually achieved them after 10 years.</p>
        <p>Any country with 50 percent underemployment would declare a national crisis.</p>
        <p>To remedy this chronic underemployment, the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation is helping create positions for humanities Ph.D.'s. As a result, new doctoral graduates are finding challenging opportunities inside and outside academia.</p>
        <p>A robust academic market for Ph.D.'s in the humanities requires a robust market for these professionals throughout the economy.</p>
        <p>ROBERT WEISBUCH  Princeton, N.J., June 7, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is president of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation.</p>
