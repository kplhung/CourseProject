        <p>Devils Coach Larry Robinson made his way off the bus and through the crowd at the Meadowlands, carrying the Stanley Cup in front of him like a battering ram as he pushed through the doors to the Devils' offices.

        <p>Devils Coach Larry Robinson made his way off the bus and through the crowd at the Meadowlands, carrying the Stanley Cup in front of him like a battering ram as he pushed through the doors to the Devils' offices. He was also dragging a Neiman Marcus bag, the spoils of an enjoyable trip to Dallas.</p>
        <p>Robinson propped the cup on the reception desk, where it immediately became the gathering spot for pictures as members of the Devils' organization posed next to the prize. But no players stepped inside, instead descending from the bus, exhausted, most rushing to their cars and the exit.</p>
        <p>A few lingered, like Scott Stevens, who stood in the middle of the traffic, holding his Conn Smythe trophy while the small crowd of fans, friends and family members congratulated him and posed for pictures, too. But most of the players just seemed to want to get home after an exhausting finish to the Stanley Cup finals late Saturday night with a 2-1 double-overtime victory over the Dallas Stars in Game 6.</p>
        <p>The Devils had gotten little sleep, reveling in the joy of their second Stanley Cup in six seasons as they celebrated. Jason Arnott, who scored the game-winning goal, hoisted the cup one more time when the team plane landed at Teterboro Airport. As cars rushed by, he was the last to leave today. Asked how tiring the last stretch of the season had been, with a triple-overtime game on Thursday, a flight to Dallas and then the double-overtime victory, he laughed.</p>
        <p>''You don't even want to know,'' Arnott said. ''Now it's time to kick our feet up.''</p>
        <p>Arnott was one of a few players who took the celebration to a Dallas hospital hours after the game was over, carrying the cup to their teammate Petr Sykora, who was injured in the first period and was kept overnight for observation.</p>
        <p>Sykora seemed fine today. A CAT scan when he arrived at the hospital and another one this morning showed no problems other than the headache he had as he got into his black Corvette and drove away.</p>
        <p>''He's fine,'' said Lou Lamoriello, the Devils' president and general manager. ''Larry and I went right after the game to see him. A little story which I think is great; when we got there, they had him monitored and he was left quiet, but he had a television watching the game. When we scored in overtime, he screamed and they all went running to the room. They thought something was the matter, and he woke up everyone around.''</p>
        <p>Today, a small but enthusiastic crowd gathered outside the Devils' offices, lining the walkway to the door and spreading into the parking lot as the players made their getaway. Some, mostly veterans who knew just how special this moment was, stayed to enjoy it. Two of the last to leave were Stevens and Ken Daneyko, who are among the nine players who were also part of the Devils' first championship team in 1995.</p>
        <p>''We have a good core of fans that really support our team,'' Stevens said. ''They're always there for us, which is nice.''</p>
        <p>Daneyko added: ''I think this one is a little bit sweeter. The first one was a whirlwind. You don't know how to react. It's just very tiring. Besides playing into overtime, there was a lot of celebrating. The guys had a great time, a lot of fun together. It was something special, something I'll treasure the rest of my life. I really appreciate it the second time around.</p>
        <p>''I'm pretty fortunate, along with eight other guys on this club who've won it twice in two tries. And to win it in grueling fashion after losing in three overtimes is special. We have a lot of heart-and-soul guys.''</p>
        <p>The team will probably reconvene with a similar group for the start of camp next season. Only one player, Claude Lemieux, is an unrestricted free agent. But just who will be guiding them is uncertain. The team has been sold by John McMullen to YankeeNets, a transaction that will take effect next month. McMullen, who will get an additional $1 million on the sale price of the Devils for winning the Stanley Cup, was unable to accompany the team to Dallas, but greeted them on the tarmac at Teterboro. And Lamoriello has not stated whether he will remain.</p>
        <p>''First of all, what I'd like to do is enjoy what we've accomplished right now,'' Lamoriello said. ''And then we'll look at this team at the appropriate time. Everybody is a part of what's transpired.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes decisions and focuses are in one individual area, but this is an organization that belongs to the players and everyone involved. There's not one M.V.P.''</p>
