        <p>The New York City Ballet has named Andrea Quinn, the music director of the Royal Ballet in London, as its new music director. The appointment of Ms. Quinn, 35, a conductor whose experience has included work with major opera and symphony orchestras as well as the recording of Paul McCartney's recent composition, ''Tuesday,'' ends an unabashedly public search by the company. In the last two years 12 guest conductors, including Ms. Quinn, have led the City Ballet's orchestra.</p>
        <p>The concerted effort to find a music director to succeed Gordon Boelzner, who has been ill, came in the wake of complaints from the company's artistic management and members of the public about the inconsistent quality of the musicians' performances.</p>
        <p>A monthlong strike by the orchestra's members last winter was settled after they agreed to a formal commitment stating that City Ballet is their primary employer and to new work rules that will not permit outside engagements to affect rehearsals and performance at City Ballet as in the past.</p>
        <p>Ms. Quinn, who will join the company officially as music director in August 2001, went out of her way to call both the dancers and musicians outstanding. In an interview at the end of last week at the New York State Theater before she returned to London, she said she looked forward to the company's range of music and to being involved in the creation of new works. She also said she hoped the company could sponsor independent concerts for the musicians in the way the Royal Opera House does for its musicians.</p>
        <p>The works of City Ballet, which has the widest musical repertory of any ballet company in the world, are frequently set to music, often difficult, that is most often heard in concert halls, rather than to scores specifically written for ballet.</p>
        <p>Ms. Quinn will begin her three-year contract in 2001 after her contract with the Royal Ballet expires. Until then she will continue to conduct as a guest at City Ballet, and Mr. Boelzner, who will retire after 41 years with the company, will remain music director, a post that involves advising Peter Martins, City Ballet's artistic director, on the choice of music. Hugo Fiorato will remain principal conductor.</p>
        <p>Ms. Quinn, whose liveliness in the pit is reflected in her conversation about music, said she had been interested in conducting since she was a teenager. Born in London but brought up mainly in the town of Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire, she began clarinet lessons at 13. At 15, she heard a recording of Brahms's First Symphony, and ''that was that,'' she said, explaining that the music led her to explore ''what is inside a score and find the heartbeat.'' That, she added, is ''the wonderful part of conducting.''</p>
        <p>After studying music at Nottingham University, Ms. Quinn specialized in conducting at the Royal Academy of Music until 1989 and won two prizes there. In 1993 she won the Conduct for Dance Competition and was appointed music director of the London Philharmonic Youth Orchestra. She was also guest conductor at the Birmingham Royal Ballet in 1993-94 and became music director of the Royal Ballet in 1998.</p>
        <p>Asked if some of the musical repertory at City Ballet was new to her as a conductor, she said she had not previously conducted Stravinsky's ''Agon,'' which was written by the composer for George Balanchine, the company's co-founder.</p>
        <p>''Balanchine was so forward looking,'' she said, adding that while she enjoyed conducting full evening 20th-century story ballets, their scores were often fashioned out of pieces of music. City Ballet's respect for the integrity of a score appeals to her: ''These scores are untainted by someone coming in and cutting the music up,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Quinn, who has conducted the English National Opera and symphony orchestras in Europe and Australia, expresses particular interest in new music. Her preferred contemporary composers are James MacMillan and Thomas Ades, both British, and Poul Ruders, a Dane.</p>
        <p>As City Ballet's fourth music director, she will be its first female conductor. But she said: ''I hate being talked about as a woman. I should be considered as a conductor.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Quinn is married to Rod Champ, a doctor, and has two daughters. Dr. Champ expects to qualify to practice in the United States and the family is to join her in New York.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't think of coming without them,'' Ms. Quinn said.</p>
