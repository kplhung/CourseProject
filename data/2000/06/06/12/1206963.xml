        <p>MARKOWITZ-Alfred M., MD, 73, died June 9th, 2000. A wonderful and beloved husband, father and grandfather, brilliant educator, masterful surgeon and extraordinary person. He will be terribly missed by Sydell, his adored wife of 45 years, his four children, Dr. Arlene Markowitz, Dr. David Markowitz, Dr. Marian Haber and Mrs. Amy Rosen, and his nine grandchildren. He will be remembered for his integrity, quiet strength and humanity as well as for his remarkable intellectual achievements. He enriched the lives of all of those who were fortunate enough to have known him. Shiva will be observed for the week at his home in Scarsdale, NY. The family requests that donations be sent to The Alfred M. Markowitz Endowment For Scholars, Department of Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, Milstein Hospital, Building 7, New York, NY 10032.</p>
