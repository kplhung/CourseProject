        <p>It is an online advertiser's dream: an Internet site consisting entirely of banner ads, those animated rectangles found at the top of a Web page that exhort viewers to ''click here'' for sales information.</p>
        <p>But the 70 examples of banner ads found on the new ''clickhere!'' site (www.soulbath .com) do not try to sell products.</p>
        <p>If anything, they are selling the concept of banner ads, in a backhanded answer to the growing perception that the tiny, kinetic billboards are a costly and ineffective way to advertise.</p>
        <p>Florian Schmitt, who has a Web-design firm, Hi-Res (www.hi-res.net) in London, asked fellow designers from around the industry to submit alternate approaches to banner ads by filling a 400-by-80 pixel space with ''sense or beauty, or both.'' The results were put on the Web site last week.</p>
        <p>Although some of the entries are crudely anticommercial or blatantly self-promotional, many do induce an irrepressible urge to click.</p>
        <p>Mat Poprocki's minimalist offering, for example, is all white except for the text ''don't click here.'' You just can't help yourself, even if nothing happens when you inevitably do click.</p>
        <p>Others include Ed Burton's ad, a rectangular cage for a series of squirming geometric creatures. Chris McDermott's banners explode into shards or sag down the screen.</p>
        <p>Maurizio Poletto's ad acts as an actual Web browser, forcing users to view a page through a banner-size slit. And Andrew Cherry's entry mimics the on-screen display for a Windows file transfer but shows money flying out of a wallet, with the message ''Please Wait -- Extracting Cash.''</p>
        <p>The site may be an exhibition of antibanners, but, Mr. Schmitt said, ''I don't hate banner ads. They're just not as good or as clever as they could be, so no one watches them anymore.''</p>
