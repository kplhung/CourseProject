        <p>Changes are afoot at CNBC that could mean more statistics and data and less Geraldo Rivera.</p>
        <p>In one sign of changes in the air, workers began building a new set at the network's studios in Fort Lee, N.J., over the weekend. When it is completed, a 47-foot wide wall of video screens will stand behind the anchor's desk.</p>
        <p>The wall will somewhat resemble the busy electronic data board used by reporters in the glass Nasdaq market studio in Times Square. The screens will either display separate bits of information or a single image, while an anchor or correspondent addresses viewers. For instance, a correspondent at the New York Stock Exchange could be shown on the wall while being interviewed by an anchor. Or, producers could use the wall to flash facts or charts of interest to viewers.</p>
        <p>CNBC executives said it will take some time for them to become used to the wall and that they have not fully figured out how to meld it into all their programs.</p>
        <p>''It's a fairly complex device,'' said Bruno Cohen, CNBC's senior vice president for business news. ''No one has built one before, so we'll have to figure out how to use it.''</p>
        <p>Still, he said, it is expected to dominate CNBC's business news programs eventually. The wall will make its debut sometime in July.</p>
        <p>That also happens to be when executives are considering dropping Geraldo Rivera's ''Upfront Tonight'' program, which covers the general news of the day and runs on weeknights at 7:30, and replacing it with more business news.</p>
        <p>''Upfront Tonight'' is the lead program of CNBC's evening block of nonfinancial programming, which also includes ''Hardball with Chris Matthews,'' Mr. Rivera's talk show, ''Geraldo Live,'' and ''The News with Brian Williams.''</p>
        <p>For some time, CNBC executives have been considering expanding business news into that block. Earlier this year, they said, Mr. Rivera let them know he was less interested in continuing with ''Upfront Tonight'' and would prefer to concentrate on his talk show and other projects for NBC, like stand-alone specials.</p>
        <p>One executive, however, said no decision had been made and that nothing would change until midsummer. Mr. Rivera was not available for comment.</p>
