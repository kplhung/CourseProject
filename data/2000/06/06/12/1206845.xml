        <p>EVENTS</p>
        <p>Mirror Images</p>
        <p>Through the decades of the 20th century, the art of Norman Rockwell (1894-1978) reflected a sentimentalized America of small-town soda fountains, barbershops and mischievous children, of friendly policemen and new automobiles and family celebrations and the Four Freedoms. Beginning on Saturday at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, more than 70 of Rockwell's oil paintings and all 322 of his Saturday Evening Post covers will be exhibited in what is described as the first comprehensive exhibition of his art. Included in ''Norman Rockwell: Pictures for the American People,'' which spans 60 years and continues through Sept. 24, are preliminary sketches, photographs, color studies and detail drawings. Information: (202) 639-1700.</p>

        <p>Leopold and Molly</p>
        <p>In Dublin on June 16, 1904, Leopold Bloom set forth, and James Joyce immortalized the day in his landmark novel, ''Ulysses.'' So it is that on Friday, ''Bloomsday on Broadway XIX,'' the 19th annual celebration of ''Ulysses,'' will take place from 7 p.m. to midnight at Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street. With Isaiah Sheffer as host and writers and actors like Frank and Malachy McCourt, Fritz Weaver, Steven Lang, Rochelle Oliver, Lois Smith and Frances Sternhagen, a thousand years of Irish poetry will be explored. There will be selections from Yeats, Synge, Seamus Heaney and of course Joyce. Information: (212) 864-1414.</p>
        <p>Her Way</p>
        <p>Picasso was her lover; Giacometti, Braque and Matisse, her friends. Like Matisse, she was fond of images captured with a bold, simple line. Like Picasso, she was willing to free herself from convention and distort form. She is Francoise Gilot, considered a major feminist voice in the School of Paris. Beginning on Wednesday, 46 paintings and drawings from the first decade of a career that initially won her acclaim in 1943 will be exhibited at the McMullen Museum of Art at Boston College. ''Francoise Gilot: 1940-1950'' continues through Sept. 24. Information: (617) 552-8587.</p>
        <p>Curtain Up</p>
        <p>With preview performances of the United States premiere of Alan Ayckbourn's version of the 1870 Aleksandr Ostrovsky play ''The Forest,'' the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival will open its 2000 season tomorrow at its F. M. Kirby Shakespeare Theater on the Drew University campus in Madison. The comedy of manners, about two vagabond actors, a comedian and a tragedian who wreak havoc on a rich, insular country estate in Russia, plays through July 2. Information: (973) 408-5600.</p>
