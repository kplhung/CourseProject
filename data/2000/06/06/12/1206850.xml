        <p>IN the spring of 1998, Internet retailers were troubled to learn that, according to Forrester Research, two-thirds of Web shoppers abandoned their ''shopping carts'' before actually buying something. At the time, and throughout last year, e-commerce companies pledged to improve the shopping experience, giving customers no reason to leave without passing through checkout.</p>
        <p>But because investors showed little inclination to penalize e-tailers for basic deficiencies like failing to close the sale, these resolutions were frequently shuffled to the back burner in favor of planning TV ads and making business development deals.</p>

        <p>IN the spring of 1998, Internet retailers were troubled to learn that, according to Forrester Research, two-thirds of Web shoppers abandoned their ''shopping carts'' before actually buying something. At the time, and throughout last year, e-commerce companies pledged to improve the shopping experience, giving customers no reason to leave without passing through checkout.</p>
        <p>But because investors showed little inclination to penalize e-tailers for basic deficiencies like failing to close the sale, these resolutions were frequently shuffled to the back burner in favor of planning TV ads and making business development deals.</p>
        <p>And so, consumers are still abandoning their Web shopping carts at the same rate they did in 1998, according to a recent report by Shop.org, an industry trade group.  But now, with e-tailers under increasing pressure to start actually making money, Web merchants are suddenly being serious in their efforts to squeeze whatever cash they can from site visitors.</p>
        <p>According to a report planned for release today by Creative Good, a consulting firm in New York, e-tailers could generate substantially more revenue by focusing on basic customer needs, like speed and simplicity. The report estimates that e-commerce companies could realize an additional $20 billion in sales this year -- bringing overall Web sales to some $57 million -- by improving site design, navigation and overall ease of use.</p>
        <p>Creative Good's chief executive, Phil Terry, acknowledges that prescribing these changes may be much easier than having sites implement them. ''We've seen a real resistance to the basics in the industry,'' he said, ''which indicates that this is just the tip of the iceberg.''</p>
        <p>For instance, Mr. Terry said, many e-commerce sites still fail to track their order conversion rates -- the rate at which visitors become paying customers. Shop.org recently pegged the average conversion rate at 1.8 percent, but Mr. Terry, said e-tailers could easily raise that rate to 2.5 percent.</p>
        <p>Ignoring such a core statistic, he said, indicates how little attention many sites are paying to what visitors actually do once they are at the site. The Creative Good report focuses on a number of key categories in which merchants typically fail their customers, including page design, site search and the checkout process.  The report criticized marthastewart .com, for instance, for letting customers add out-of-stock items to the shopping cart without informing them until reaching the final checkout that the items are unavailable.</p>
        <p>Martha Stewart, the chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, acknowledged this shortcoming but disputed the notion that changing it would be easy. ''We're working on that,'' Ms. Stewart said,  ''but the coordination between the catalog and the Internet operations has to be perfect before we can do it.''</p>
        <p>The company that handles inventory and fulfillment for marthastewart.com, the Time Customer Service unit of Time Warner, has an older computer system, she said, so it takes a while for the site to search Time's database for in-stock items. Because of this, Ms. Stewart and her executives had decided not to slow things down with a real-time inventory check of each item as a shopper selects it.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Stewart said the company was searching for a fulfillment partner that would enable the site to display real-time inventory without slowing down the customer. ''It's a minute-to-minute task, to keep up with technology and customer demands,'' she said. ''It's a constant thing.''</p>
        <p>The Web is littered with glaring examples of poorly designed pages and features, of course. The Creative Good report acknowledges as much, pointing out sites that label products poorly (or not at all), sites that try to pack too much information and sites that require customers to fill out a lengthy questionnaire before they can actually browse for goods.</p>
        <p>Indeed, if there is a common criticism from those within the industry, it is that e-commerce sites may be interesting to look at or listen to, but they are not easy enough for many customers to use. And that, says H. Robert Wientzen, president of the Direct Marketing Association, may be because e-tailers are still struggling to shed their high-technology habits.</p>
        <p>''It comes down to a reverence for technology,'' Mr. Wientzen said. ''A lot of the people who started these sites are technologists, and in the beginning, at least, the people who used the sites were more savvy about technology.'' Now that the Web is more closely aligned with mainstream culture, he said, the sites must cater to the capabilities of nontechnical customers.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, technology itself is making it easier for Web sites to be more shopper friendly, according to Ford Cavallari, who heads the e-business practice for Renaissance Strategy, a consulting firm in Boston. Mr. Cavallari said that in the last year, companies that made software that helped Web sites create their pages -- content management software, in industry argot -- had ''moved forward a light year from where they were.''</p>
        <p>''Webmasters were always behind the eight ball,'' Mr. Cavallari said. ''They were throwing content together on the page. But as this software has gotten better, the staff has more time to get more creative and spend time on value-added activities.''</p>
        <p>The new urgency on the part of retailers to make a profit could be a boon to shoppers. Too often, consumers have been lured to the Web by the promise of convenience, only to find the experience less convenient than shopping at the mall.</p>
        <p>Ron Hanners, executive vice president of JCPenney.com, said competitive pressures had forced his site to become more user friendly. He said the company planned to introduce a new version of its site in October -- an overhaul that will have taken a year and the efforts of about 300 people to create.</p>
        <p>Through the redesign, he said, the company has focused on its average customers: women, ages 25 to 55, with a household income of $55,000 to $70,000. ''It's the sweet spot of middle America,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And a conclusion from the many customer focus groups the company has conducted while testing the redesign, Mr. Hanners said, is that middle America is most interested in ''noncluttered'' Web sites. The challenge in putting this insight to use is  that JCPenney.com has 10,000 product images to display.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanners would not disclose specifics of the site's new design. But he said it would give customers options on how they would like to shop, although not so many options that they would be confused.</p>
        <p>''When we started the redesign, I thought it'd be easy,'' he said. ''Then I moved to thinking of it as extremely impossible. Now I'm somewhere in between. People talk about e-commerce being easy. Well, I'm an old retailer, and I don't recall ever working this hard at retail.''</p>
