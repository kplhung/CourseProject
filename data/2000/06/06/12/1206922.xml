        <p>FORGET Hack-a-Shaq. The Pacers' Jalen Rose may have stumbled upon a real ratings gimmick when he suggested that equally difficult to beat would be Shaq and four hacks.</p>
        <p>''They're the same team with you four guys standing out there,'' Rose told a small gathering of reporters the other day. ''As long as they've got Shaq in the paint.''</p>
        <p>With all due respect to the hobbled Kobe Bryant, that would be an excellent vantage point from which to cover the National Basketball Association finals -- from the left wing, making the entry pass to Shaquille O'Neal, before flipping open the laptop to record his latest adventure at the free-throw line.</p>
        <p>But the reality is that no one player -- not Wilt, not Jordan, not Shaq -- has ever won a championship without a partner or two. And based on last night's 100-91 Pacers victory in Game 3, Shaq is going to need a healthy Bryant soon to close this series out.</p>
        <p>Nineteen years ago, on the eve of the finals, Moses Malone claimed that he and four buddies from the playgrounds of Petersburg, Va., could handle the Boston Celtics. Given the opportunity with a supporting cast that wasn't much of an upgrade, Malone and his Houston Rockets surrendered in six games.</p>
        <p>Larry Bird, of course, was playing in that series, as opposed to coaching Indiana to a 2-1 series deficit with Game 4 coming up Wednesday night and Bryant, according to Phil Jackson, not likely to be 100 percent ''for a while.''</p>
        <p>Before we go any further, I know what most Knicks fans were thinking after watching Shaq win the first two games of the series in Los Angeles, and my advice is, forget it. If you think the Knicks' front line would have been a better match, consider that it was physically obscured in the Eastern Conference finals by one Dale Davis, who now looks like a kid riding Shaq piggyback.</p>
        <p>In all likelihood, Jeff Van Gundy's lovable louts would not have been content to play Hack-a-Shaq either. It would have been more whack, smack and thwack. Kurt Thomas in his face, Charlie Ward at his knees. That's all the league would have needed in this playoff season of the viewers' discontent, more tasteless posturing and a few more technical fouls and more free throws for these teams to shoot.</p>
        <p>Say this for the maturing Shaq, who used to get frustrated by the hacking and would occasionally threaten retaliatory mayhem. Throughout these playoffs, he has taken the tactical taunting for what it is, his personal cross to bear, and just marches professionally to the line to do his best. He missed another 10 of 13 last night, after clanking 21 of 39 in Game 2. That game in Los Angeles dragged like five sets in Paris but, as Bird later drawled: ''Well, I don't worry about ratings. I'm trying to win a ballgame.''</p>
        <p>It's not classic basketball, or television, but then the All-Star Game is a freewheeling dunkathon every year, and it is stultifying to the point of being unwatchable. These games are at least the result of honest competition.</p>
        <p>If the Devils and the Dallas Stars resort to conservative hockey to avoid making that one killer mistake and take the final Stanley Cup games into the wee hours, well, that's sport, in nonscripted splendor. If the N.B.A. is so concerned about stoppages of play and length of the game, maybe it can pressure the network to take fewer commercial breaks, and allow for some sense of continuity to be established in the game. Or go the other way completely, and start awarding Shaq prize money for every free throw he hits, adding to the pot as the game moves along and the shots mean more.</p>
        <p>There's been talk that the league might tinker again with the rules to further discourage the Hack-a-Shaq, but the sport begins to look fake when it modifies its game to adjust to a particular player. Make your free throws. End of story. For my money, there are concessions being made by any coach who puts O'Neal at the line, consistently hoping to trade 1 point for 2.</p>
        <p>For one thing, he is guaranteeing even more possessions for the Lakers. For another, he is conceding even the possibility of a turnover, a basket in transition, and allowing O'Neal and the Lakers to set up their defense.</p>
        <p>For all that will be made of Shaq's poor free-throw shooting last night, the Pacers really won this game in the third quarter when they played physical and pesky defense, forced Laker turnovers and stretched a 5-point lead to 18 with transition offense that produced open-court looks. Hack-a-Shaq may be the prudent strategy down the stretch. Attack-a-Shaq will put them in position to win.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, as someone once said -- Pat Riley or James Naismith -- no playoff statement is really made until someone wins on the road. In that case, here's where the Lakers are: in the driver's seat but one sprained ankle and Shaq's Achilles' mean this season isn't over yet.</p>
