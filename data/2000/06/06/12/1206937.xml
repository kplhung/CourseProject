        <p>Units of the B Com3  Group are merging and acquiring abroad.</p>
        <p>B Com3  in Chicago is merging the Japanese operations of two of its agencies -- the Leo Burnett Company and D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles. The new agency, to be called Beacon, will have 300 employees and billings estimated at $430 million from clients like Kellogg, Polaroid and Procter &amp; Gamble.</p>
        <p>Dentsu Inc. in Tokyo, which owns approximately a 20 percent stake in B Com3 , will take a significant equity stake in Beacon, the terms of which are still being negotiated, and supplement the venture with employees and business.</p>
        <p>Phil Rubel, 42, president at the Tokyo office of D'Arcy, becomes president and representative director at Beacon. Phil Fiebig, 50, president at the Tokyo office of Burnett, will assist in the transition, but relocate to another B Com3  agency by the end of 2000.</p>
        <p>In Europe, D'Arcy is acquiring Grupo K Comunicacion in Madrid, a marketing services agency with 100 employees and billings estimated at $75 million from clients like Hewlett-Packard. Terms were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>Grupo K will be merged with D'Arcy's International Marketing &amp; Promotions Company in Barcelona, Madrid and Lisbon, which has 25 employees and billings estimated at $25 million from clients like Philips. Carlos Diaz, 37, president at Grupo K, will continue as president at the merged agency, to be known as Grupo K-IMP.</p>
