        <p>Size and position prevent Reggie Miller from ever waging a genuine duel against Shaquille O'Neal. But for one raucous night on his home floor, the corn-silk-thin swingman of the Indiana Pacers pulled back his slingshot anyway and fired. And fired.</p>

        <p>Size and position prevent Reggie Miller from ever waging a genuine duel against Shaquille O'Neal. But for one raucous night on his home floor, the corn-silk-thin swingman of the Indiana Pacers pulled back his slingshot anyway and fired. And fired.</p>
        <p>And when he had finally wiped away the perspiration with the multicolored wristbands on his bony forearms -- and survived the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 3 much more than he ever scaled Mount O'Neal -- Miller and 18,345 fans at Conseco Fieldhouse rejoiced wildly, as if their team had accomplished the implausible in celluloid.</p>
        <p>Small-market Hoosiers 100, Goliath and the Lakers 91.</p>
        <p>Rebounding from a dismal showing in Los Angeles much the way his teammates did, Miller matched O'Neal's 33 points on 11-of-22 shooting. What's more, with Kobe Bryant sidelined with a sprained left ankle, Indiana made the National Basketball Association finals a contest rather than a coronation.</p>
        <p>Miller made 8 of 8 foul shots in the fourth quarter, including two with 13.2 seconds remaining after the Lakers had crept within 3 points and turned an embarrassing blowout into riveting theater.</p>
        <p>''This is my team,'' Miller said afterward. ''I've got to step up and do everything sometimes. The offense was funneling through me, and I was taking advantage.''</p>
        <p>The Pacers now trail the Lakers by two games to one in the four-of-seven-game series and are host for Games 4 and 5, on Wednesday and Friday. O'Neal was held to only 33 points and 13 rebounds and made only 3 of 13 free throws after exploding for 83 points and 43 rebounds in Games 1 and 2.</p>
        <p>The Lakers were hampered without Bryant, whose sprained left ankle, sustained in the first quarter of Game 2, kept him on the sideline.</p>
        <p>Lakers Coach Phil Jackson said Bryant approached him 35 minutes before tip-off and said he could play, but Jackson told his 21-year-old guard to rest up for Game 4.</p>
        <p>After breakdowns on both ends by the Lakers, they need help on Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>''We started the season without Kobe,'' O'Neal said, referring to Bryant's missing the first two months of the season with a broken wrist. ''With Kobe, he adds 20 points every night.''</p>
        <p>Jalen Rose finished with 21 points and 6 rebounds for the Pacers, who shot 46.2 percent from the field and outrebounded the Lakers, 39-33. Travis Best and Austin Croshere combined for 26 points off the bench.</p>
        <p>With a major role reversal, tonight's game almost mirrored Game 1. Like the outplayed Pacers last Wednesday, the Lakers spent so much energy trying to recover from Indiana's first-half barrage that they had little left to finish a potential comeback. Indiana led at the half, 53-42.</p>
        <p>For every overpowering jump hook of O'Neal's released 12 inches from the rim, Miller answered with a jab-step jump shot. He became flammable near the end of the third period as the Pacers first went on a 12-0 binge and then blew the game open.</p>
        <p>Miller's 3-pointer from the right wing with 2 minutes 13 seconds left in the quarter put Indiana in front, 76-58, and turned Conseco into a madhouse. Raising his hands and motioning for the fans to rise from their seats, skipping gleefully downcourt, the Pacers' brilliant shooter showed that Miller time had finally arrived in the league championship series.</p>
        <p>''We just have to tail him, put a hand on him and hope he misses,'' O'Neal said.</p>
        <p>''Being at home, he came out with the eye of the tiger and got us going early,'' Rose said. ''That was the difference.''</p>
        <p>After shooting 8 for 32 in the first two games and showing little of the passion and purpose he showed in the Eastern Conference finals against the Knicks, Miller locked away the impostor in the No. 31 jersey.</p>
        <p>The player who suited up for Game 3 knew his and his teammates' reputations were at stake. He understood the magnitude of a possible 0-3 deficit, knowing no team had come back from such a hole in any seven-game playoff series.</p>
        <p>By halftime, he had 14 points on 7-of-14 shooting. It was not just his long jumpers hurting the Lakers, either.</p>
        <p>Miller hung in the air after O'Neal fouled him with 8:10 left in the second quarter, clutched once and lofted a layup that fell through. He pumped his fist wildly after the basket, and the free throw gave Indiana a 30-19 cushion.</p>
        <p>''Our energy level was much higher, we did a much better job controlling the boards and our effort was tremendous,'' Miller said.</p>
        <p>''I can't play quiet,'' he added. ''There's no way. I play on emotion and excitement, and it's always been that way.</p>
        <p>''I'm still more upset with myself for Games 1 and 2.''</p>
        <p>After the Pacers held a lead of no more than 3 points in both games at the Staples Center, it was easy to see how different a team they were on their home floor, where they were a league-best 35-6 this season.</p>
        <p>Whether the Lakers were rattled by the crowd, thrown off by Bryant's absence or both, they had none of the cohesion that carried them to a 2-0 series lead. They produced 10 turnovers in the first 24 minutes, some of which were unforced and clumsy.</p>
        <p>The game began with all the pageantry expected with Indiana's playing host to its first N.B.A. finals game, a sea of yellow towels waving furiously inside the intimate arena.</p>
        <p>Then the Pacers went to work.</p>
        <p>As Miller dropped bombs from beyond the arc, Rose stopped and popped from 15 feet and the Pacers found a way to contain the league's most dangerous team. The mood of the series had changed.</p>
        <p>Indeed, in 28 other N.B.A. cities, the Lakers have already been crowned. But this is Indiana, where the mightiest teams from the biggest towns sometimes have problems against the underdogs from the country.</p>
        <p>Even the skinny, resilient ones who grew up in California.</p>
        <p>Asked why he did not receive better treatment from the officials at home in Game 3, Miller replied: ''I've watched a lot of N.B.A. finals games and you almost have to get murdered to get fouled. You have to earn every foul. But the key is to keep going back in there.''</p>
