        <p>Local elections held in Montenegro today, closely watched as a barometer of this small republic's future, suggested that it remains perilously divided between following the West, or staying with President Slobodan Milosevic and Serbia.</p>
        <p>Ostensibly, voters in the Montenegrin capital, Podgorica, and in the seaside town of Herceg Novi, were simply electing new mayors and local assemblies.</p>
        <p>In fact, the vote was effectively a poll on who wants to stay with Mr. Milosevic and Yugoslavia -- which now consists only of Serbia and Montenegro -- and who prefers the more independent course of Montenegro's leader, Milo Djukanovic.</p>
        <p>Western ministers and diplomats have leaned heavily on Mr. Djukanovic in recent months to avoid a complete break with Belgrade and to postpone any referendum on independence. It is also not clear that the president and his ruling coalition will win sufficient support; opinion polls indicate a fairly even split among Montenegro's 600,000 people between staying with their traditional allies, the Serbs, and breaking all ties with Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>Both outsiders and residents of this small republic fear that any outright rupture with Belgrade would cause another in the series of Balkan wars that have erupted since the old Communist Yugoslavia began splitting apart a decade ago.</p>
        <p>Early unofficial results suggested that the situation remains sharply divided. Mr. Djukanovic's coalition -- ''For a Better Life'' -- apparently won the majority of the 28 council seats at stake in the capital, Podgorica, but was losing to the pro-Yugoslavia coalition in Herceg Novi. That slip, if confirmed, would a strengthen Mr. Milosevic's allies and could eventually tempt Belgrade to challenge Mr. Djukanovic's hold on power.</p>
        <p>Violence has already begun to color the politics of Montenegro, where the atmosphere remains uneasy 10 days after a close aide of Mr. Djukanovic was killed in what appears to have been a political assassination.</p>
        <p>The Yugoslav Army presence in Montenegro remains a persistent cause for concern for the government as do political supporters of Belgrade, who have threatened to take to the streets if they lose today's ballots.</p>
        <p>Few local issues were raised during the boisterous flag-waving rallies this last week.</p>
        <p>The government coalition kept to its familiar slogan and the name of the president, offering a program of democratic reform and openness to Europe and the West and a hint towards independence. ''We have never sold our authority, and will never sell our country,'' Mr. Djukanovic said at a rally in the capital last week. ''That's what we want for Montenegro and our future.''</p>
        <p>The pro-Belgrade opposition, led by the Yugoslav prime minister, Momir Bulatovic, and the local leader Predrag Bulatovic (no relation to Momir), ran with the simple message ''Yugoslavia.''</p>
        <p>Predrag Bulatovic has emphasized that Montenegro and Serbia are equal partners in the union, yet he has been forced into a coalition with both the most radical Serbian nationalist party and its leader, Vojislav Seselj, and the leftist party run by Mr. Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic. Both that alliance and televised footage of his meeting with Mr. Milosevic in May to discuss these elections undermined Predrag Bulatovic's claim to equal partnership.</p>
        <p>The small Liberal Alliance, which caused these elections by withdrawing from the government coalitions in both cities, has slipped from view behind the larger parties. The most vocal supporter for independence, and a critic of the Djukanovic government, it hoped to win a larger part of the vote in new elections, but has been drowned out by the greater confrontation with Belgrade.</p>
        <p>Today, voters in the capital were clear about their choice. Supporters of the government said they had voted for democracy, for modernity, openness to the West and a future inside Europe. ''It is the only choice with perspective,'' said a student who gave his name only as Aco.</p>
        <p>''I voted 'For a better life.' No one wants to live worse,'' said Milisav Miuskovic, a school janitor, quoting the government coalition slogan.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the pro-Belgrade coalition were often reluctant to talk to a Western journalist or declined to give their names. When they did, their arguments were direct.</p>
        <p>''I voted for Momir,'' said Rada, a saleswoman who declined to give her full name. ''I am for Yugoslavia, I do not want to separate from Serbia. The people will not let it happen.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Djukanovic appeared confident and relaxed, driving himself to his local polling station in the city and walking in with his wife and only a small security detail.</p>
        <p>Yet the campaign has not been an easy ride for him. Goran Zugic, his close friend and security adviser, was shot dead outside his apartment on May 31 in an attack that shook the political establishment and the public who turned out in huge numbers for Mr. Zugic's funeral. Diplomats based in the region suspect the hand of Belgrade and say the killing amounted to an attack on the president himself.</p>
        <p>But trouble has also surfaced from other directions. Mr. Djukanovic's younger brother, Aco, caused a scandal when he was arrested for his involvement in beating of a man in the lobby of Podgorica's main hotel. The man, a liberal politician, was admitted to hospital with a serious injury from a pistol butt to the head.</p>
        <p>''They are taking the law into their own hands,'' Miroslav Vickovic, the liberal leader and candidate for mayor, said of Mr. Djukanovic and his supporters. ''They think they can do anything.''</p>
        <p>The Liberal Alliance has also criticized the Djukanovic government for its slowness on promised reforms, murky privatization deals and widespread corruption. The government has managed to attract financial support from the West and now questions are being asked as to where that money has gone.</p>
        <p>''Talk to people and ask them about privatization and they will tell you it is all illegal stealing,'' Mr.  Vickovic said.</p>
        <p>''We have no audit office, no parliamentary control of the budget. The government has no culture of public interest. The problem is the lack of institutions and controls over the government,'' said Nebojsa Medojevic, an independent economist.</p>
        <p>Rather than address those criticisms, Mr. Djukanovic and his political allies chose to clean up Podgorica, pouring money into several civic projects such as placing new benches in the parks and new garbage bins in the streets.</p>
        <p>Critics of the government charge that it is effectively using Mr. Milosevic has a useful excuse for any inefficiencies or failures.</p>
        <p>A presidential aide, Miodrag Vukovic, said that the government neither wanted nor needed these elections. ''Montenegro has plenty of problems without them. We are involved in two conflicts, an internal Montenegrin conflict between democrats and conservatives, and a second conflict between Montenegrin democracy and Belgrade dictatorship,'' he said.</p>
