        <p>After months of being skewered for moving to New York to run for the United States Senate, Hillary Rodham Clinton -- carpetbag in hand -- joined in on the joke on Saturday during an evening of satirical skits and songs.</p>
        <p>The night of political spoofing, held by the Albany press corps, included a sketch that, sung to the tune of ''The Lady Is a Tramp,'' satirized Mrs. Clinton's decision to run for office in New York: ''She changes viewpoints like three times an hour. Her only interest is grabbing some power.''</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Clinton had the last word at the annual Legislative Correspondents Association dinner, a black-tie affair during which some of the state's prominent politicians take some brutal ribbing from the news reporters who cover them daily.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton took the stage at the end, carrying a carpetbag. ''I'm just like every other New Yorker with Secret Service protection,'' the first lady told an audience of more than 500 people who frequently broke out in laughter during her 20-minute rebuttal speech.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, who moved into the Westchester community of Chappaqua a few months ago, then presented a slide show of her life titled ''The Woman From Chappaqua.'' In each frame -- whether as an infant or as an adult meeting Pope John Paul II -- Mrs. Clinton wore a New York Yankees cap.</p>
        <p>The Legislative Correspondents Association, composed of scores of the state capital's current and former reporters, has put on the show every year since 1900. The event is usually off the record, but this year, the organization's members voted to put it on the record because of the intense interest in Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton is looking to fill the seat that is being vacated this year by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who is retiring. Her Republican opponent, United States Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island, attended the show as well, but did not speak.</p>
        <p>His aides said his late entry into the race -- which came after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York dropped out of the campaign last month to undergo treatment for prostate cancer -- had left them with insufficient time to prepare remarks for the appearance.</p>
