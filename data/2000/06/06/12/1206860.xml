        <p>HE WORKS out of a cubicle not much bigger than a prison cell, but his ambit is the world.</p>
        <p>James B. Steinberg, the White House's deputy national security adviser, is less visible than his boss, Samuel R. Berger, who works in a sunlit corner office a few steps away in the West Wing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinberg seldom appears on television and tends to remain in the background at public appearances of the president.</p>
        <p>But his influence has been widely felt through his role as chairman of the committee of deputies of the government's national security agencies. And Mr. Steinberg has often colored press coverage of administration foreign policy by offering burnished versions of events to a few favored reporters. Some dare call it spin.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Steinberg's eyes, President Clinton's meetings with foreign leaders are never tense; they are ''businesslike.'' Interagency discussions are never argumentative; they are ''lively.'' One of his standing orders to staff members is that they never put anything particularly sensitive on paper; paper trails lead to subpoenas.</p>
        <p>To outsiders, he gives the impression of being a friendly, relaxed sort, but associates know, and occasionally fear, his intensity. His temper has scared away potential colleagues and shortened the tenures of several assistants.</p>
        <p>He is so single-minded that when a reporter once phoned his office seeking comment on Bosnia, he called back -- from his honeymoon.</p>
        <p>Last Friday was as close to a typical day as there is for someone at the vortex of American foreign policy. At 7 a.m., Mr. Steinberg met with the heads of the State Department, Department of Defense, Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency. The subject was a sensitive international law enforcement matter about which Mr. Steinberg would say no more.</p>
        <p>At 8 a.m., he briefed the president for a  telephone call that Mr. Clinton was to make to Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, a few minutes later. At 8:30 a.m., he attended the senior staff meeting led by Steve Ricchetti, the deputy White House chief of staff, to discuss financing for antidrug efforts in Colombia and the Pentagon budget, among other matters. That was followed by a conference call with officials at the State Department about a British peacekeeping mission to Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinberg then briefed Mr. Clinton for his meeting with President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico in the Oval Office at 12:45 p.m. After that, the Middle East, reparations for Holocaust survivors, the Northern Ireland peace process, Ethiopia-Eritrea, the Congo, preparations for the G-8 summit.</p>
        <p>It is a heady life for someone who started in the Clinton administration in 1993 as a deputy assistant secretary of state in the relatively obscure Bureau of Intelligence and Research. But Mr. Steinberg had a mentor in Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher, for whom he had worked in the Carter administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Christopher elevated him to the chief of policy planning, the State Department's internal research center, a position Mr. Steinberg described as ''the best foreign policy job anywhere.'' When the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, left after Mr. Clinton's re-election in 1996, Mr. Berger moved up and Mr. Steinberg moved into Mr. Berger's deputy slot.</p>
        <p>BUT Mr. Steinberg, 47, is leaving all that behind. This summer, he will join the Markle Foundation to work on a $100 million project to study the impact of the digital revolution on international relations and economic development. He  has known the foundation's director, Zoe Baird, since the Carter administration, in which they served as lawyers, she at the White House, he at the Department of Justice.</p>
        <p>Ms. Baird was Mr. Clinton's first choice for attorney general but withdrew from consideration after it was disclosed that she had not paid taxes for a baby sitter.</p>
        <p>The Markle project addresses many of the issues that have preoccupied Mr. Steinberg over the past seven years: the march of technology, the globalization of markets, the ubiquity of the Internet, and the social and security concerns they raise.</p>
        <p>''How do you create a governance structure for what is basically a private sector function?'' he asked. ''Government can't do this. But how can private entities bring the benefits of the networked society to developing countries?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinberg cut his teeth on local politics in Boston, where he grew up. His father was a jeweler; his mother a homemaker. He received his law degree from Yale and worked for Mayor Kevin White of Boston in the 1970's and on the Congressional campaigns of the Rev. Robert F. Drinan. He has also worked on the staff of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, on the 1988 presidential campaign of Michael S. Dukakis and for the Rand Corporation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinberg identified the agony of the Balkans and the evolution of relations between the United States and China as the two areas that have engaged him most over the past seven years.</p>
        <p>He was one of the architects of Mr. Clinton's decision in 1994 to sever the link between human rights and trade with China.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinberg defends the administration's record on Bosnia and on Kosovo, but said that the unfinished business of the Balkans remains his biggest regret.</p>
        <p>''We won't have a stable southeastern Europe,'' he said, ''until the problem of Serbia is resolved.''</p>
