        <p>If your 5-year-old asks how much money you make, and you make tons, then the appropriate reply is, ''That is not a nice question.''</p>
        <p>If your 22-year-old gives a big, boozy party and breaks up the million-dollar TriBeCa apartment that you just bought as a graduation gift, then that child is not yet ready to be trusted with serious inheritance money.</p>
        <p>If your son insists on marrying someone who is poor, then, as soon as is seemly, you should persuade the future daughter-in-law to sign a prenuptial agreement. After the signature, it is prudent to smooth ruffled feathers with a sizable cash gift that says, ''Welcome to the family.''</p>
        <p>These and other strategies for raising the rich in Manhattan were served up last week in an auction room at Christie's filled with wealthy parents and grandparents.</p>
        <p>Rich kids are something of a growth industry in Manhattan and across the country, as the number of families worth $10 million or more has jumped more than fourfold in the last decade to 275,000 from 65,000, said Edward N. Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University and editor of The Review of Income and Wealth.</p>
        <p>At least 41,000 of those families live in New York City, constituting the largest concentration of the rich in any American city, Professor Wolff said.</p>
        <p>Last week's strategy session at Christie's marshaled the expertise of four rich-kid specialists -- a headmaster at a private school, a lawyer specializing in trusts and estates, a child psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst. Together, they explained how to increase the odds that children who know they will never have to work for a living will turn out to be something other than pouty layabouts.</p>
        <p>''An awful lot of people have made an enormous amount of money and are scared what it is going to do to their kids,'' said Dale Burch, who organized the box lunch and panel discussion for which tickets cost between $100 and $500. It was the second such panel in two years at Christie's, with proceeds going to the Henry Street Settlement, a community organization on the Lower East Side. Mrs. Burch is on its board.</p>
        <p>The ideal rich kid that the experts talked about would grow up to be a hard-working adult -- smart with investments, inclined to philanthropy and comfortable in social settings with the nonrich.</p>
        <p>Unmentioned by the press-shy parents at the box lunch were the flame-outs, drug overdoses and suicides that periodically burn the names of rich families -- and their profoundly unhappy progeny -- into the public mind.</p>
        <p>In Manhattan in the last 13 months, Raphael de Rothschild, 23, heir to one of the largest fortunes in the world, died of an apparent heroin overdose on a sidewalk in Chelsea; Robert Bingham, 33, a promising fiction writer and heir to a newspaper fortune, died of an apparent heroin overdose in his loft in TriBeCa; and William Woodward III, 54, scion of a society family known as much for violent deaths as for wealth, took off his slippers and jumped to his death from his 14th-floor apartment on the Upper East Side.</p>
        <p>Judging from last week's two-hour advice session (and a videotape of last year's), three particularly vexing clusters of trouble confront parents trying to raise well-adjusted children in Park Avenue circumstances.</p>
        <p>MOTIVATION AND DISCIPLINE</p>
        <p>''You can buy whatever you want without lifting a pudgy finger.''</p>
        <p>That's how Hume R. Speyer, the trusts and estates lawyer on the panel, summed up the fundamental risk facing rich children.</p>
        <p>To defend against what Mr. Speyer called ''the dark side'' of wealth, the panel collectively offered advice.</p>
        <p>Parents should show their children, by example, that meaning in life comes from work, education and concern for others -- not from buying and bragging about clothes, cars, airplanes, apartments, summer houses and fancy foreign vacations.</p>
        <p>In practice, parents should insist that children do real work around the house, even if it means ordering servants to back off and let a child wash a dish, vacuum a rug or clean a closet.</p>
        <p>Children, at about the age of 5, should be made aware that most people are not rich and that the privileged few have an obligation to pay attention to the poor and to invest time and money in trying to help them.</p>
        <p>Children should be given an allowance that amounts to somewhat less than what they say they need, and part of it should be set aside for charitable giving.</p>
        <p>So their school-age children can't hornswoggle them with tales about what ''all the other kids are doing,'' parents should meet regularly with other parents (a relatively easy trick, since most rich kids in Manhattan attend small private schools). They should compare allowances, credit-card policies and set rules for how much money rich children can spend on one another.</p>
        <p>If your child comes home and says he wants a credit card because all the other children have them: ''Ask who and how many of the friends have credit cards,'' advised Diana Russell Deacon, the psychoanalyst on the panel. ''The list might get short very fast.''</p>
        <p>The panelists advised parents to keep children away from technology that enables unlimited spending. Instead of American Express cards, give debit cards that run dry when allowance runs out. Give cellular phones that have a prepaid chip. If children chat beyond their allotted time, then they are out of luck until next month. Car repairs and maintenance should come out of allowance, not unlimited access to dad's wallet.</p>
        <p>Dr. Peter J. Walsh, the child psychiatrist on the panel, told the story of a 19-year-old daughter from a Manhattan family who went off to an Ivy League college with a shiny new BMW convertible. When she wrecked it, her parents immediately bought her a Mercedes, and when she wrecked that, they immediately bought her a Lexus sport utility vehicle.</p>
        <p>''Parents will often go for the quick, easy solution, which often isn't the right way of dealing with the problem,'' Dr. Walsh said. ''You don't always have to smooth things over with a bigger, better thing. Instead of buying her better cars, take the time to teach her how to drive. Impose a little delay between cars, so she realizes that there are consequences for wrecking them.''</p>
        <p>DEALING WITH THE NONRICH</p>
        <p>''Do I have to fly coach so my son will not alienate other kids?''</p>
        <p>So asked one parent, who said he could not control the obnoxious bragging of his son about family money.</p>
        <p>The panelists said such bragging was common among insecure rich kids trying to establish a sense of self. To smooth a child's entry into a world where most people are not rich, the panelists agreed, parents should talk early and often with him about family money -- and about the obligations that go with it.</p>
        <p>''Be honest and matter of fact with children inside the family about the money,'' said Mr. Speyer, the lawyer, who advises starting frank discussions about money when children are in their early teens. He said the chats should become more detailed -- and should be supported with paperwork from brokers and banks -- as a teenager's capacity to understand increases.</p>
        <p>But in all these conversations, Mr. Speyer said, parents should draw a firm line between proper discussions of money inside the family and improper boasting about money with friends and all other outsiders.</p>
        <p>''By not acting like an extremely rich person,'' he said, ''you may not be treated like an extremely rich person, and that is a good thing.''</p>
        <p>When a rich child grows up in nonrich world, there is always the possibility that he or she may marry a person from that world. As with all the risks of moneyed child rearing, panel members said, the best answer is to talk early and honestly to child about the family's long-term interest in protecting its capital. This usually means, they said, bringing up the prenuptial agreement.</p>
        <p>Dr. Walsh advised parents to deal with their child and the nonrich future in-law ''as a couple.''</p>
        <p>''You should sit them both down and tell them what your concerns are,'' said Dr. Walsh. ''It is a wonderful litmus test to see the character of the person who is coming into your family.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Speyer, the lawyer, said that prenuptial agreements were ''a really good idea.'' But, he said, it is also true that ''for the poor spouse, the process can be very unpleasant.''</p>
        <p>He advises parents to cushion the upset by giving a ''not insubstantial'' gift -- as soon as the prenuptial is signed.</p>
        <p>GIVING ALL THE MONEY TO THE CHILDREN</p>
        <p>''Do you 'owe' your children your lifestyle?''</p>
        <p>This question seemed to arouse the most passion from panelists and parents.</p>
        <p>All the experts argued that parents owed their children continuity with the luxurious lives to which they had allowed their children to become accustomed.</p>
        <p>''If they have lived themselves a life of plenty, that is all they will have learned in their lives,'' said George P. Davison, head of Grace Church School, a private school in Manhattan. ''They will have been really good at it in order to please you as their parents. Then, after doing everything right for 21 years, you say, 'Sorry, you are out.' Of course, they are going to be angry. Of course, they are going to be uncomprehending.''</p>
        <p>Disinheriting a child, Dr. Walsh said, is not a humane option for wealthy parents.</p>
        <p>''This just causes rage among children and they start floundering,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nor did the experts have an encouraging word to say about ''incentive trusts,'' a new wrinkle in estate planning among the very rich. These trusts give money on the basis of performance. A child, for instance, might get more money if he became a teacher, rather than an international playboy.</p>
        <p>These arrangements are complex for trustees to administer, the panelists agreed, and they almost always make offspring crazy with rage, driving a wedge of resentment between parents and children.</p>
        <p>The panelists agreed that it was usually better for all concerned for parents to give their children just enough money to be comfortable, although the experts offered few specifics as to what that might mean.</p>
        <p>''A lot of my really rich clients have made a conscious decision not give all the money to their children,'' Mr. Speyer said. ''They set up a foundation and give the kids a chance to help decide how it will be spent. This centers the family, gives responsibility, gives life meaning.''</p>
