        <p>Poor Devils. The team may have returned to New Jersey with the Stanley Cup, the grail of the ice hockey world, but their homecoming was hardly fit for a prodigal son.</p>
        <p>First, it took them more than four and a half hours to beat the Dallas Stars 2-1 in overtime in the sixth game of the Stanley Cup finals, at which point the late news was over and most of the spectators had gone to bed.</p>
        <p>By the time their chartered plane landed at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey yesterday, they were more than an hour late, and the number of fans waiting for them in the 95-degree heat had melted down to a mere two dozen. At the nearby Meadowlands arena, the team's home, about 50 more waited, many of them people who work for the franchise.</p>
        <p>Still, the Devils, whose fan club has displayed the slogan, ''We don't get no respect. We just win,'' were not exactly fishing for compliments.</p>
        <p>As the small crowd cheered at the sight of Jason Arnott -- who scored the winning goal -- emerging from the plane with the silver cup aloft, the team, which has sold out only 2 of 41 home games this season, hustled into a bus bound for the Meadowlands without pausing for its public.</p>
        <p>At the arena, waiting reporters grumbled when most of the team, including Peter Sykora, who had been hospitalized during the game against Dallas on Saturday, made a beeline to their cars. Scott Stevens, Ken Daneyko and Arnott stayed behind to sign autographs for fans.</p>
        <p>The last time the Devils won the Stanley Cup, in 1995, their timing was no better: they were in the midst of a dispute over their lease, and there was a pitched debate over where to hold the victory parade. A couple of towns invited the Devils to celebrate, but a team spokeswoman said the offers were less than impressive.</p>
        <p>In the end, and not without ridicule, the parade was held in the Meadowlands parking lot, just after the Devils announced they were moving to Nashville. The Devils stayed, and worked it out with New Jersey, but not to the point of planning the parade route this time around. Normally, the location of a victory celebration is announced a few hours after the victory; the Devils hope to finalize plans today.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Devils fans, often characterized as long-suffering, waited for the news. James Vera, 32, said he did not mind a bit if the cavalcade was held in the parking lot again. Last time, he liked it there.</p>
        <p>''It was good just to be able to be close to the players and to be so close to the cup,'' he said. ''New Yorkers make such a big deal out of their parades, but in New Jersey it's more personal. They can see your face and your joy.''</p>
