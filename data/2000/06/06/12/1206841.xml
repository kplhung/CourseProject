        <p>There was plenty of room to dance at the Sixth Element festival, which presented more than nine hours of electronic dance music on Saturday. The dance floor was 10 blocks long and covered with grass: the soccer fields on Randalls Island. To hear more than two dozen disc jockeys and six electronic bands, thousands of club kids faced daylight. From about 2:30 p.m. to midnight they shook, jumped and made angular martial-arts gestures; a few break-dancers spun on their heads.</p>
        <p>Sixth Element presented simultaneous music on four stages (and in a fifth disc-jockey showcase backstage). It had one tent dedicated to house music, another for drum and bass, a main stage dominated by trance and a ''chill out'' area for less categorized music. It included the pioneering hip-hop disc jockeys Afrika Bambaataa and Kool DJ Herc, along with proponents of newer styles. During the set by the disc jockey Sandra Collins a hip-hop graffiti artist, Seen, and some helpers spray-painted a large panel with a ''Seen'' tag (stylized signature) emerging from ghostly shapes.</p>

        <p>There was plenty of room to dance at the Sixth Element festival, which presented more than nine hours of electronic dance music on Saturday. The dance floor was 10 blocks long and covered with grass: the soccer fields on Randalls Island. To hear more than two dozen disc jockeys and six electronic bands, thousands of club kids faced daylight. From about 2:30 p.m. to midnight they shook, jumped and made angular martial-arts gestures; a few break-dancers spun on their heads.</p>
        <p>Sixth Element presented simultaneous music on four stages (and in a fifth disc-jockey showcase backstage). It had one tent dedicated to house music, another for drum and bass, a main stage dominated by trance and a ''chill out'' area for less categorized music. It included the pioneering hip-hop disc jockeys Afrika Bambaataa and Kool DJ Herc, along with proponents of newer styles. During the set by the disc jockey Sandra Collins a hip-hop graffiti artist, Seen, and some helpers spray-painted a large panel with a ''Seen'' tag (stylized signature) emerging from ghostly shapes.</p>
        <p>Because Sixth Element didn't have a headliner like Fatboy Slim or the Chemical Brothers who had reached the mainstream rock audience, it was an event for dance music devotees. Its most widely known performer was probably Perry Farrell, formerly of Jane's Addiction and Porno for Pyros, who did a disc jockey set. And its most elaborate spectacle was by Rabbit in the Moon, who used video and costumes as diversions from imitative music.</p>
        <p>Sixth Element revealed both the insularity and omnivorousness of dance music. With every segue a disc jockey chooses between the familiar and the challenging. Holding on to the beat keeps the music functional, stoking the motion on the dance floor; changing it might provide new pleasures but could also break the music's spell. Although disc jockeys can draw on the totality of recorded music, many prefer to stay within the confines of a genre.</p>
        <p>Afrika Bambaataa defied such specialization. With open ears and fast hands, his set went jump-cutting from funk to rock to electro-pop. Mr. Farrell was just as omnivorous, dancing behind his turntables as he moved from billowing chords to dub-reggae echoes to Donna Summer to African funk. Mixmaster Morris offered relaxed, acid-jazz-tinged music: sonic watercolors separated from the digital crispness all around him. Justin Johnson also eluded genres, slipping samples from ''The Matrix'' into a giddy and ominous mixture of funk, rap and techno.</p>
        <p>Bands with live performers added ethnic exotica to the dance beat. Organic Grooves sought a gentle, East-meets-West sound, with undulating vamps of a sitar-toned guitar; Medicine Drum's female singer topped a live and computerized beat with Middle-Eastern-style vocal quavers.</p>
        <p>Most disc jockeys preferred to polish their niches. Dave Ralph and Ms. Collins methodically assembled tracks -- sustained chord, bouncing-octave bass line, beat -- then removed the beat and let suspense build before a triumphal crescendo pounded back to the beat. Hybrid, a live trance band with drums, keyboards and disc jockey, filled in the same formulas. But Donald Glaude revitalized the strategy with harsher, more anarchic material: notes that skidded sideways, a beat that buzzed like a ferocious busy signal.</p>
        <p>Among the house disc jockeys, Erick Morillo made the steady thump carry a benevolent party spirit and gospel-charged diva voices. Kevin Yost was more adventurous, switching from jazzy ease to bursts of dissonance and distortion. Miss Honey Dijon also took chances with rougher sounds, and at one point in her set she shifted from house to trance. In the drum-and-bass tent Aphrodite and Mickey Finn played jittery, starkly etched tracks; Trace broadened the music with brooding piano and earthy funk. And Kool DJ Herc rested on his laurels, playing 1970's funk songs while he encouraged the break-dancers.</p>
        <p>Large-scale dance parties tend to take place outside New York City and run all night long. When Sixth Element ended at midnight, those with more dancing left in them probably headed for the clubs, which were just getting started.</p>
