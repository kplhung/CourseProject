        <p>I was all set to announce my  candidacy for mayor of my town (''Narayanan Subramania for mayor of Sleepy Hollow'' -- it had a  nice ring to it) when I was stopped cold in my tracks by a campaign aide who brought to my attention Jeff Greenfield's June 6 Op-Ed  article about how the names of candidates are getting shorter and shorter.</p>
        <p>Memories came up of many first days at work, when a new co-worker (invariably a Gary or a Larry) would say upon being introduced, ''Now, what can we call you for short -- Nary?''</p>
