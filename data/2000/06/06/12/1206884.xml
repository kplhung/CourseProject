        <p>If you want to make a list of the Syrian dictator Hafez al-Assad's good deeds, begin with this: he was an enemy of Iraq's Saddam Hussein. That's where the list ends.</p>
        <p>On the debit side of his life's ledger can be included his eager alliance with Soviet Communism; his slaughter of thousands of dissident Syrians in Hama; his avid support of terrorists worldwide; his military occupation of neighboring Lebanon; and most consuming of all, his abiding hatred of Israel, which made Assad the Arab world's most relentless rejectionist.</p>
        <p>At his funeral tomorrow, crocodile tears will flow from Yasir Arafat, long the object of Assad's contempt, who must be delighted at having outlived his tormentor.</p>
        <p>Western leaders will proclaim respect for ''stability'' provided by such dictators-for-life. Groping for ways not to speak ill of the dead, they will note that once Assad grudgingly made an agreement, he ''kept his word'' by sealing his side of the border.</p>
        <p>Wisely, Bill Clinton decided to bypass this chance at wearing his inimitable lip-biting mournful look, and won't dispatch Vice President Al Gore, his normal substitute, to Damascus.</p>
        <p>Why? Because three months ago, at a much-touted meeting in Geneva, Clinton presented Assad with the Golan Heights on a silver platter. The Syrian then humiliated the supplicating American by refusing to take yes for an answer, making fresh demands for control of Galilee that embarrassed not only Clinton but even the most appeasement-prone doves in Jerusalem. Assad scuttled negotiations in the most dramatic way possible.</p>
        <p>As a result, an unelected official, the secretary of state, will represent the U.S. at the state funeral of a world figure; that deliberate diplomatic slight will not be lost on Middle East leaders or American voters.</p>
        <p>Does the dictator's demise help or harm the processing of peace? It helps.</p>
        <p>Short-term, this week's attempt to transfer power to his son, Bashar, means that the ''Syrian track'' is derailed for at least this year. That delay is not a matter for hand-wringing. On the contrary, the implacable Hafez was pressing the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, into a corner that might have resulted in Israelis, in a referendum, voting to turn down a deal that would deliver the high ground in return for treaty promises.</p>
        <p>Longer-term, the absence of Assad will help because the dictator was driven by pride to recapture in negotiation every inch of land he lost in foolish early aggressions. That intensely personal motive for self-justification is gone. Several scenarios now present themselves:</p>
        <p>1. Worst case: anarchy in Syria. The Assads come from a religious minority, the Alawites; the majority Sunnis may want to take over. The dictator also struck a balance among his military, his spy service and his political party; his 34-year old son, figurehead of the regime's insiders, may not have the manipulative cunning of a father who in the end could be expected to make neither peace nor war. Anarchy could lead to coups, riots, a reckless lashing-out at Israel, rapprochement with Saddam. Hebrew University president Itamar Rabinovich, expert on Syria, tells me he's concerned that ''The days of predictability may be over.''</p>
        <p>2. Less bad case: a balance of internal powers behind a dictator who needs to make peace to survive. If not Bashar, this could be a militarist or politician able to establish internal order -- ''stability'' -- without Hama-style massacres. Economic incentives might induce him to bring home 30,000 troops from Lebanon as Iran's Hezbollah is induced to leave.</p>
        <p>3. Best case: the young man leads angry, backward Syria into the modern world. Bashar is an ophthalmologist, educated by London eye doctors. He heads the computer society in a socialist land too worried about dissent to permit Internet access to anybody beyond the elite. With initial investment from Saudis and the emirates, and with a little canniness and a lot of luck, he could introduce the rudiments of market reform and prosperity to a freedom-parched land. It's wishful thinking, but that's how a real peace could take hold.</p>
        <p>As newscasters learn to pronounce ''ophthalmologist'' (first two syllables are ''ahf'' and ''thal''), Syrians will adjust to life after Hafez. To succeed, whoever follows him must reject a life of rejection.</p>
