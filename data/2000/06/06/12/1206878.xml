        <p>Damascus today was a contrast in silence  of mourning and secretive political maneuvering -- and the noisy grief of tens of thousands.</p>
        <p>Normally, public gatherings are not permitted in Syria. Today, residents of the capital streamed into the streets -- under the watchful eyes of security guards -- to mourn their president, Hafez al-Assad. By sunset, the crowd had swelled into tens of thousands flooding to the Umayyad Square near the Chami Hospital where they believed his body still lay, awaiting Tuesday's burial.</p>
        <p>Chanting over and over, ''Hafez, the beloved of God,'' in Arabic, the mourners carried poster-size photographs of both the Syrian leader and his son Bashar, the heir apparent. ''Our blood, our soul, we redeem you, Bashar,'' they called.</p>
        <p>Some mourners wept. A group of young men beat their bare chests so hard it left welts.</p>
        <p>One young man, seated atop the shoulders of his friends, with a black stenciled portrait of President Assad painted on his bare chest, repeatedly thrust his fists in the air and implored the crowds to respond with ever greater adoration for the deceased President Assad, the only leader many Syrians have ever known.</p>
        <p>''We loved Assad too much,'' said Rifaat, a driver who would not disclose his last name. ''He brought stability to our country.''</p>
        <p>In contrast to the noise and tumult of the streets, Syrian television played Koranic verses and, besides images of the mourners, showed scenes of Bashar Assad meeting with Lebanese officials -- President Emile Lahoud, Prime Minister Selim al-Hoss, and the speaker of Parliament, Nabih Berri -- at his home. The Lebanese delegation also went to the hospital where Hafez al-Assad's body was presumed to lie.</p>
        <p>Unseen was the maneuvering that propelled Bashar Assad closer to the top of Syria's secretive elite, which nominated him for president at a closed meeting of the ruling Baath party.</p>
        <p>Beyond the streets where the mourners gathered, the rest of Damascus was respectfully shuttered, the somber quiet broken only by small bands of marchers. Soldiers prevented access to streets near the president's home, turning away cars and pedestrians.</p>
        <p>Mourning continued into evening, when torch-bearing youth groups marched in the darkness.</p>
        <p>Basam Salameh, 17, a secondary-school student,  said he reacted in disbelief to the news of President Assad's death. But, he said, to many Syrians, the 34-year-old Bashar represents the hope for the future.</p>
        <p>''All the people want Bashar Assad to be president of Syria,'' Mr. Salameh said. ''Maybe he can do what the people want for our country and our population.''</p>
