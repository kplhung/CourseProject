        <p>When surgery showed that Dr. Henk Laane's 77-year-old patient, a woman who had been in his care for more than a decade, was riddled with cancer, she immediately asked him to help her die.</p>
        <p>At first, Dr. Laane said no. There was no unbearable suffering yet, he argued. There were still some good times ahead. But when several months had passed and she was in the grip of chronic diarrhea and nausea, so much so that not an hour went by uninterrupted, Dr. Laane finally agreed to help.</p>
        <p>She wanted to die on her birthday and gathered her family around her at home. She had traditional Dutch bon voyage cakes ready for the doctor and his nurse and she asked that they eat the cakes first.</p>
        <p>Then, with everyone gathered at her bedside, Dr. Laane gave her an injection.</p>
        <p>''It is never easy to help someone die,'' said Dr. Laane, a month later. ''You take it with you. You bring it home. You don't sleep so well after.''</p>
        <p>In the last two decades, mercy killings and assisted suicide of terminally ill patients have been widely tolerated here, with prosecution for such acts becoming less and less likely.</p>
        <p>But soon the Netherlands is expected to take a further step with a  new bill that would decriminalize such acts if certain criteria are met, giving this country the least restrictive laws on mercy killing and assisted suicide in the world. Dr. Laane's actions last April 15, for which he was not prosecuted, would become fully legalized. The new law, which almost everyone here expects will be passed in the fall, could allow help to die for people ranging from Alzheimer's disease sufferers to perhaps even terminally ill children as young as 12.</p>
        <p>The Dutch are not alone in Europe in moving toward legalization of mercy killing and assisted suicide. Belgium too has been debating legalizing euthanasia for months now, with more than 40 witnesses appearing before its Parliament to tell their stories. Switzerland already allows assisted suicide under some conditions.</p>
        <p>Many other European countries have high-powered committees reviewing the issue, including one in France that recently recommended that euthanasia be considered in certain cases. And, in general, euthanasia activists say their ranks are growing. For less than a year, euthanasia was legal in part of Australia, but that law has since been repealed. In the United States, Oregon allows assisted suicide in some cases.</p>
        <p>Still, the Netherlands remains the only country that has tolerated it for years, and now lawmakers and health officials here say the aim of the new legislation is to make sure that what happens during a patient's final hours happens in the open, where it can be scrutinized and regulated.</p>
        <p>Health officials say that in the five-year study period from 1990 to 1995, including the period after 1993 when new regulations made it easier to admit to euthanasia, the percentage of cases actually reported to the authorities more than doubled. But even then, anonymous surveys indicate, doctors were not reporting 60 percent of their cases.</p>
        <p>''If it remains a punishable offense, we will never see the transparency that we are aiming for,'' said Jacob Visser, a spokesman for the medical ethics division of the Health Ministry which, along with the country's Justice Ministry, helped shape the bill. ''To get that, we must get this out of the criminal system.''</p>
        <p>The debate over euthanasia has raged here for more than two decades. But surveys show that it has increasingly won popular support. A 1998 survey showed that more than 90 percent of the population is now in favor. Yet the details of exactly when it should be administered and to whom are still hotly contested.</p>
        <p>The bill, introduced last fall in Parliament, brought more than 540 questions from legislators and activists during the review process, among the most government officials had ever gotten. They say they are still scrambling to answer all those questions before the summer break. Many experts believe that some changes will be made before the bill is voted on this fall, including raising the age of patients permitted to ask for help in dying to 16 or 18 from 12.</p>
        <p>But the core of the bill is not likely to change. Doctors' actions in helping patients to die would no longer be routinely reviewed by prosecutors but instead by a committee of doctors, lawyers and ethicists. To qualify for help to die, a patient's request must be ''durable,'' he or she must face ''unbearable suffering'' and have no ''reasonable alternative'' to death. The doctor must also consult at least one other independent physician before helping a patient to die.</p>
        <p>In fact, the country's medical association is now training 1,000 doctors to be specialized consultants in the field. The three-day course is by most accounts emotional and draining. These doctors do not intend to perform euthanasia, but to give a second opinion and advice and information to other doctors considering such action.</p>
        <p>The curriculum ranges from teaching doctors to resist pressure from their patients to technical information on relieving pain and other conditions that may have become unbearable for the patient, such as incessant itching, inability to swallow or slow suffocation from blood in the lungs. Some of the course focuses on telling the patient's story so it can be properly reviewed.</p>
        <p>''No physician has been taught in medical school how to write about the ending of someone's life,'' said Dr. Gerrit Kimsma, a professor at Free University in the Netherlands, who is helping to train the doctors. ''Their stories are often not rich enough. When you look at the papers you can't see the nature of the suffering, so we teach them that too.''</p>
        <p>Despite wide support for euthanasia, the medical profession and indeed the country is still gripped in a debate over its details.</p>
        <p>The new bill introduces for the first time the possibility of an ''advance directive'' so that a patient could indicate ahead of time that he or she wishes to die at a certain point. It will for the first time open the door for patients suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease to get help dying if they have signed such a directive early in their illness.</p>
        <p>In the past, such patients have not qualified because they are not considered by some to be suffering ''unbearably.'' While their condition may cause anguish to their families, they themselves may be unaware of it.</p>
        <p>The advance directive has caused an uproar in some circles and may end up being deleted from the bill. For the Christian Right Association, which has supported some euthanasia bills, the new bill goes too far. The opposition party objects to both the advance directive and the cessation of the review process by the prosecutor's office.</p>
        <p>''For us, this is going down the slippery slope,'' said Clemence Roos, a spokeswoman for the Christian Right. ''Eight years ago, we were hearing 'never' for dementia. 'How dare you suggest that we will go that far?' And now, it's being treated like it's just a fact of life.''</p>
        <p>''The goal of this legislation seems to be: just tell us what you do, it doesn't matter what it is.''</p>
        <p>In contrast, some euthanasia activists feel that some of the language in the proposed new law may actually make it more difficult for patients to control at what point they want to die. The law seems to tighten some of the criteria used in the past to regulate the decision. For instance, it says the patient's decision must be ''durable.''</p>
        <p>''This may imply some sort of time element that wasn't there before,'' said Dr. Rob Jonquiere, the managing director of the Dutch Voluntary Euthanasia Society. ''There are a couple of things like that which actually may be a step backward.''</p>
        <p>In the last decade, fewer than a handful of doctors have been prosecuted for helping patients to die with injections such as the one Dr. Laane gave or by supplying them with drugs to take their own lives when they were ready. But thousands of cases have been reported to the authorities.</p>
        <p>The country has built a body of data on the subject, largely from two huge studies conducted in 1990 and 1995. The data show that 90 percent of the patients requesting euthanasia are in the final stages of cancer. Most die in their homes.</p>
        <p>Both supporters and opponents of assisted suicide and mercy killing use the statistical evidence to bolster their cases. Supporters say that euthanasia remains rare despite the lack of prosecution.</p>
        <p>While the actual number of such cases rose slightly between 1990 and 1995, researchers said they would expect that, given several factors including the aging of the Netherlands' population and the relative increase in cancer patients. The surveys showed that about 9,000 patients asked their doctors for help in dying in 1995 and about 3,600 got such help. Overall, there were about 150,000 deaths in the Netherlands that year.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes people think, ah, in Holland you go to a doctor and you get an injection,'' said Reina van de Valk, who helped evaluate doctors' decisions to perform euthanasia in 1999. ''But they don't realize how hard it is for doctors.</p>
        <p>''The whole process is so emotional. It is so difficult after trying to save a patient, to preserve life, then to change course.''</p>
        <p>Government officials say that anonymous surveys have actually shown a decrease in the ''slippery-slope areas,'' the number of cases where a doctor helps a patient die without an explicit directive. In most cases, this involves patients with mental illness who are suffering but incapable of making a request or newborns with congenital disorders, perhaps involving a decision by the parents. But opponents of euthanasia look at the numbers differently. Many include decisions to stop treatment or to use painkillers that may hasten death as cases of euthanasia. Opponents argue that they do, in fact, see a dangerously high number of slippery-slope cases.</p>
        <p>Some aspects of the Dutch model make it difficult to compare it to what is going on or what might go on in other countries. For one thing, medical care is virtually free in the Netherlands, so concern over the cost of care would presumably not influence a decision here, as it might in America.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the medical system here revolves around the general practitioner, who usually has known his or her patient for years. Such a relationship can make it much easier for a doctor to be comfortable with a patient's decision.</p>
        <p>While the new law would legalize euthanasia if the rules are followed, it does not give a patient the right to euthanasia. The doctor always has the final say on whether to help. Surveys indicate that about 10 percent of doctors in the Netherlands are opposed to euthanasia in principle. No one knows how many have balked at the last minute for emotional reasons, but it does happen.</p>
        <p>Yvonne Jager still shakes when describing what happened when her mother wanted help dying five years ago. Diagnosed with a brain tumor, her mother quickly signed a paper saying she wanted help dying when circumstances became ''unbearable.'' She thought she had her family doctor's promise that he would help when things got too difficult.</p>
        <p>Her condition deteriorated fairly rapidly. One day, she smeared butter all over the walls. After that, she was placed in a nursing home where she soon became paralyzed and could only say yes or no to questions. But when she indicated to her daughter that she wanted to die now, the doctor said he just could not do it. Ms. Jager tried to find another doctor to help, but none would.</p>
        <p>Finally, she went to her mother and took her by the hand: ''I said I was sorry, but I was not going to be able to do anything to help her. I told her that if she really wanted to go, she had to stop eating and drinking, and so she did.</p>
        <p>''It took three days.''</p>
