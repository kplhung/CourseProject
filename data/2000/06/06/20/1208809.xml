        <p>Taking a less traveled path in the quest to replace damaged organs with parts grown in the laboratory, a professor at the University of California at San Francisco reports that he has changed human skin and gum cells into bone and cartilage.</p>
        <p>''Sounds like science fiction, doesn't it?'' said the researcher, Dr. Rajendra Bhatnagar, who is head of the university's graduate bioengineering group. ''But that's what we do.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Bhatnagar's findings, detailed in the latest issue of Cells and Materials, a peer-reviewed journal, provides one of the first alternatives to researchers' widespread reliance on stem cells, the primordial cells from which all others emerge.</p>
        <p>For several decades, researchers have tried to find a source of living cells to coax into new tissues. Most are focusing on stem cells, because, in theory, they can be manipulated to form any organ in the body.</p>
        <p>But they are difficult to harvest.  Stem cells are found in bone marrow, but make up only one out of every 10,000 cells, or even fewer as patients age, making them extremely difficult, not to mention painful, to excavate and isolate through biopsies and other means.</p>
        <p>Human embryos offer another source of stem cells, but the prospect of mining biological matter from fetuses has raised objections. In 1994, President Clinton banned the use of money from the National Institutes of Health for experiments that either create or destroy embryos, a policy Congress later adopted.</p>
        <p>Using embryonic stem cells also has immunological complications. Just as the body rejects transplanted organs from donors, it can reject tissues grown from donated cells.</p>
        <p>Skin, however, is not only the largest organ in the body, providing researchers with a seemingly unlimited number of cells, but it is also the most accessible. Within the dermis, the middle layer in the folds of human skin, is an abundance of fibroblasts, the cells that Dr. Bhatnagar and his researchers convert into bone and cartilage. So it is with gums as well, where fibroblasts are plentiful and, Dr. Bhatnagar reports, equally pliable.</p>
        <p>From a snippet of skin or gum tissue no more than a few cubic millimeters in volume, Dr. Bhatnagar says he can generate enough tissue to fill a hole in bone or cartilage many hundreds of times that size. And because the fibroblasts come directly from the donor, there is no risk of rejection.</p>
        <p>''This will have enormous impact in the field,'' said Dr. Antonios Mikos, vice president of the Tissue Engineering Society and editor of Tissue Engineering, which published a paper by Dr. Bhatnagar last year on converting a type of fibroblast found in gums into bone. ''There are many technologies trying to isolate stem cells from bone. The problems of those technologies may be solved if one can use dermal fibroblasts.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Bhatnagar's newest paper describes the transformation of a different type of gum cell, the gingival fibroblast, into bone. In November, CeraMed Dental, a small company owned primarily by Dentsply International, got approval from the Food and Drug Administration to sell a product based on Dr. Bhatnagar's research for patients with advanced gum disease. CeraMed paid the university for the rights to use the research; Dr. Bhatnagar says he has no financial interest in the company.</p>
        <p>Inserted wherever teeth have eroded, CeraMed's product, Pepgen P-15, works by transforming fibroblasts in the gums into bone, CeraMed officials say. In clinical trials required for F.D.A. approval, the product proved 38 percent more effective than current methods of plugging holes in teeth, and generated new growth over roughly three-fourths of deteriorated areas. In one test, a middle-aged man whose jaw had become too dilapidated to bear false teeth had his gums packed with the pasty substance. After six months, he had grown what amounted to a new jaw, somewhat crudely formed, but solid enough to withstand drilling and support fake, screw-in teeth.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bhatnagar hopes the technology can be adapted to eliminate the need for costly operations for other degenerative diseases. Osteoarthritis, characterized by a breakdown in the joint's cartilage, is the principle cause of nearly half a million knee and hip replacements each year, according to the American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons.</p>
        <p>Of course, fibroblasts are not supposed to turn into bone or cartilage. Biologists have long believed that cells do not change course once they fully differentiate.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Bhatnagar pays them no mind. After spending more than 40 years tinkering with the laws of nature, he has learned to be irreverent. ''There is no dogma that has any true basis,'' he is fond of saying.</p>
        <p>His skeptics disagree. Dr. Arnold Kaplan, a founder of Osiris Therapeutics and one of the first scientists to isolate the stem cells found in bone marrow, said he was not familiar with Dr. Bhatnagar's work but speculated that the professor was unknowingly experimenting with another type of stem cell, called a pericyte, which also inhabits blood-rich tissues like skin and gums.</p>
        <p>Pericytes, virtually indistinguishable from fibroblasts, are as flexible as their counterparts within bone marrow, and may explain how Dr. Bhatnagar's findings seemingly throw the developmental process into reverse. ''We don't know that you can take one type of tissue cell and get it to back up,'' Dr. Kaplan said. ''In the cases that have been looked at with some rigor, that isn't how it happens.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Bhatnagar said his years of experimenting left him certain that it was the fibroblasts that were changing their properties, and as he publishes more findings he is convincing a growing number of his peers.</p>
        <p>His work with fibroblasts began in the late 1980's. Dr. Bhatnagar sent his graduate students to the university's medical clinic, where they collected the discarded foreskins of just-circumcised babies. Then he extracted the fibroblasts and placed them on a matrix that closely mimicked the properties of bone.</p>
        <p>Surrounded by minerals, held fast by P-15, a string of sticky amino acids that allowed them to interact, the skin cells conformed to the new environment as if they always belonged there. Within three weeks, the cells began producing proteins found only in bone. The same was done with  more fibroblasts, this time from gum tissue, with the same results.</p>
        <p>Then the researchers packed fibroblasts tightly together and deprived them of oxygen, imitating the conditions of cartilage. Once again, the cells responded, as if they knew the lines of different characters and delivered them as soon as the set was changed. ''They completely forgot how to be skin cells,'' said Dr. Bhatnagar. ''We played mind games with the cells. We made them think of home.''</p>
