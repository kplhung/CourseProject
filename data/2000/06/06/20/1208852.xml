        <p>The United States and China agreed today to step up cooperation in the fight against illegal drugs, especially heroin and methamphetamine. The two drugs have emerged as scourges in both countries and throughout much of Asia.</p>
        <p>For the last few years, American and Chinese law-enforcement agencies have sometimes cooperated to stop contraband drug shipments.

        <p>The United States and China agreed today to step up cooperation in the fight against illegal drugs, especially heroin and methamphetamine. The two drugs have emerged as scourges in both countries and throughout much of Asia.</p>
        <p>For the last few years, American and Chinese law-enforcement agencies have sometimes cooperated to stop contraband drug shipments. But today the two governments signed their first formal agreement to share information and evidence related to drug smuggling. Officials from both sides predicted more wide-ranging collaboration.</p>
        <p>The agreement was announced here by Barry R. McCaffrey, a retired Army general and director of the White House drug-control office. General McCaffrey is visiting China with other anti-drug officials as part of an eight-day tour and will also stop at Hong Kong, Hanoi and Bangkok.</p>
        <p>''This is an important moment,'' General McCaffrey said after two days of talks with Chinese officials. General McCaffrey, the first top American drug official to visit China, said such collaboration was vital to combating global heroin trafficking and the fast-rising abuse of methamphetamine.</p>
        <p>Since China began opening its borders in the late 1970's, it has become a major transit route for heroin produced in Southeast Asia, especially Myanmar. Chinese gangs ship some of that heroin to the United States, although most heroin sold there is from Latin America.</p>
        <p>At the same time, heroin addiction has risen in China, especially in the southern province of Yunnan and in the western region of Xinjiang, which receives heroin smuggled from Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>According to charts provided by General McCaffrey's office, factories in southeastern China are important producers of methamphetamine, which is sold throughout East Asia, and of ephedrine, an ingredient of legal medicines that is also used to produce methamphetamine.</p>
        <p>General McCaffrey listed several areas in which the United States hopes to gain cooperation, including sharing intelligence about drug operations, curbing money laundering, controlling precursor chemicals, analyzing seized drugs to identify their sources and fighting the smuggling of weapons.</p>
        <p>The director of drug enforcement at the Public Security Ministry, Yang Fengrui, said he believed that Chinese-American cooperation was ''going to enter a new stage.''</p>
