        <p>Due to the extraordinary degree of interest in the current presidential campaign, we are going to answer a few of the burning questions that have been raised about the Gore/ Bush proposals for Social Security.</p>
        <p>No, really. Feel free. Ask us anything.</p>
        <p>So, do you think it was O.K. for them to eat the rats on ''Survivor''?</p>
        <p>Yes, it is well known that only cute species feel pain. Besides, animal rights rules do not apply to anything that crawls into people's kitchens and scurries around the woodwork.</p>
        <p>However, ''Survivor'' rats are not an issue in this political campaign. Except perhaps metaphorically.</p>
        <p>I just can't get all that worried about Social Security. It's not going to run out of money soon, is it?</p>
        <p>Social Security is not due to become insolvent until Al Gore and George Bush are around 90. We have pending crises with earlier due dates, but both men seem particularly attached to this one.</p>
        <p>Don't Gore and Bush seem like the same person to you?</p>
        <p>For all his talk about trust funds and ''retirement savings plus,'' Al Gore is basically a Democrat who wants to spend more money on domestic programs. George Bush can organize his schedule so he will never be seen with another rich white person until November, but he's still a Republican who wants to cut taxes and spend more money on defense. Plus one has funny ears and says ''I don't appreciate'' for ''I don't like,'' and the other has a bald spot and talks as if he were dictating a letter.</p>
        <p>Is there any way you can work Tiger Woods into this? I think people would pay a lot more attention to the presidential race if Tiger Woods were involved.</p>
        <p>Tiger Woods is not a part of the presidential campaign. But he was on the Ryder Cup team that George W. Bush inspired with a reading of Col. William Travis's ''victory or death'' letter from the Alamo.</p>
        <p>Has Al Gore ever helped us win the Ryder Cup?</p>
        <p>No, but he does occasionally phone Shaquille O'Neal to wish him luck before a big game. Now would you like to hear about Social Security?</p>
        <p>No, explain the Bush ''Star Wars'' program. That has more of a summer-movie feel to it.</p>
        <p>Today we are talking retirement. You may have read, for instance, that Mr. Bush wants to let people invest part of their Social Security money in the stock market.</p>
        <p>Can you give me some details?</p>
        <p>Of course. That's why we're having this little talk. The details are that citizens will be allowed to take an as-yet-undetermined chunk of their Social Security money to invest, thereby earning a much larger return unless the market happens to crash at an inconvenient time. The program will create an as-yet-unestimated hole in the regular Social Security program, which will apparently have to be made up by yet-to-be-announced reductions in benefits.</p>
        <p>Did you know that polls show there are more young people who believe in U.F.O.'s than believe they'll ever get Social Security benefits?</p>
        <p>Oh, please. Young people don't believe they'll ever be old enough to collect Social Security. It's like when Mick Jagger said he couldn't imagine singing ''Satisfaction'' when he was 40.</p>
        <p>When Al Gore was young, did he ever think he'd be old enough to collect Social Security?</p>
        <p>Al Gore always was and always will be 55, which will start to become a real advantage once he's 70. His Social Security plan involves using most of the surplus to pay down the national debt. Then as the debt gets smaller we'd take the money we save on interest payments and squirrel it away to help pay for Social Security and Medicare benefits when the baby boomers retire.</p>
        <p>Maybe the baby boomers should just have to work forever. It'd serve them right.</p>
        <p>As a member of the baby-boom generation, I'm getting really tired of the rest of you people throwing darts at us just because we got to stay in college until we were 32. Life wasn't a bed of roses back in the 60's. We were always trapped between boring young men who kept talking about what they would do to end the war as sophomore class president, and fraternity guys who'd laugh when somebody threw up on your shoes. It is no small burden to realize that we've got one of each running for president.</p>
