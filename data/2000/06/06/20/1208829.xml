        <p>Nothing better illustrates the profound racial and social-class biases in our criminal justice system than your June 17 news article about the student at an elite boarding school who carved a sexual slur into the back of a fellow student, a few days after slashing another student.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Nothing better illustrates the profound racial and social-class biases in our criminal justice system than your June 17 news article about the student at an elite boarding school who carved a sexual slur into the back of a fellow student, a few days after slashing another student.

        <p>Compare this egregious example of white middle-class privilege with the likely fate of any inner-city youth who similarly pleaded guilty to such crimes: long years in jail, probably in an adult prison. The politically seductive campaigns to ''get tough on juvenile crime'' -- cruel, misguided and counterproductive to start with -- are made even more destructive by their racially selective implementation.</p>
