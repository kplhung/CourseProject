        <p>Being paired with Tiger Woods on Sunday gave Ernie Els a chance to watch history from the front row.</p>
        <p>Els sounded overwhelmed. But at least he was honest.</p>
        <p>''It seems like we're not playing in the same ballpark right now,'' Els, a two-time winner of the United States Open, said. ''When he's on, you don't have much of a chance.''</p>
        <p>A statement like that, coming from a player of Els's caliber, crystallized the problem facing the world's other top players. Woods is in a class of his own. And school is just getting started.</p>
        <p>At age 24, Woods won the Open by a record-setting 15 strokes Sunday, and increased the psychological edge he held over the competition. Even for Woods, what he did over four days at Pebble Beach was remarkable. It was stunning. It was breathtaking. But it was not a fluke.</p>
        <p>It was simply the world's best player at his best, validation that when he performs at his highest level, everyone else is playing for second place.</p>
        <p>What long-term impact will that have on Woods's peers? That question will be answered during the next two decades, when Woods stalks Jack Nicklaus's record of 18 professional majors. It will hard for the competition to forget what Woods did at Pebble Beach. And if the aura of his presence intimidates some of his competitors, Woods will gladly take the advantage.</p>
        <p>''As far as intimidating other players, I just try to put myself in contention each and every time I go out,'' he said. ''If they fall by the wayside because I'm there, so be it.''</p>
        <p>Sunday's victory gave Woods three major championships -- the Masters (1997), the P.G.A. Championship (1999) and the United States Open. Only seven players have won all three of those championships -- Gene Sarazen, Byron Nelson, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Raymond Floyd, Nicklaus and Woods. That is elite company for anyone, even more elite for a 24-year-old. But based on Woods's dedication, his love for the game and his talent, there is no reason to believe that his early career success will make him complacent.</p>
        <p>The missing major jewel for Woods is the British Open, which will be played next month at St. Andrews, Scotland, on a course that fits his game like a tailored suit. Based on Sunday's performance, Woods will arrive at St. Andrews with more confidence than ever. And his competitors will arrive with even more questions to answer.</p>
        <p>Nicklaus's career was long and brilliant, but despite his greatness, others carved out greatness for themselves as well. Arnold Palmer, Player, Lee Trevino and Tom Watson all won memorable head-to-head battles against Nicklaus in majors, stepping up to the challenge in golf's premier events.</p>
        <p>But this is clearly the Woods era, and it remains to be seen if other top players will step forward during future majors, or step back. Vijay Singh has stepped forward, winning his second major at this year's Masters. Woods entered that tournament as the clear-cut favorite but finished fifth.</p>
        <p>But many of today's top players have not yet won a major. Phil Mickelson turned 30 at the Open, but he has not won his first major. David Duval is the world's No. 2-ranked player, but he has not won a major yet, and has not won a tournament of any kind since April 1999. On Sunday, Duval finished 19 strokes behind Woods. Colin Montgomerie, considered the best player in Europe, has never won a major, and he has never won a tournament in the United States. At 36, Montgomerie has to be wondering if it will ever happen.</p>
        <p>Whenever Woods's name appears on the leader board, Montgomerie sounds a little bit too willing to concede, to accept that no matter what he does, Woods will do it a little bit better. On Sunday, Montgomerie finished 27 shots behind Woods.</p>
        <p>Golf tends to be cyclical, with even the best players going though peaks and valleys. But Woods seems capable of prolonging his peaks and narrowing his valleys. In his last 23 starts worldwide, Woods has won 13 times. And in those 23 starts, he has finished out of the top 10 only twice.</p>
        <p>It is a surprise now when Woods does not contend. And he is so strong mentally, he seems unaffected by the expectations of others because his own expectations are so high.</p>
        <p>Did Woods expect to win the Open by 15 strokes? He did not. Did he expect to win the Open? Of course.</p>
        <p>Does Woods think he will surpass Nicklaus's record of 18 professional majors? He is not certain. Will he do everything in his power to give himself the best chance, like working hard on his game and staying in supreme physical condition to increase his longevity? You bet.</p>
        <p>This is a special time in golf, the arrival of a superstar who is determined to maximize his enormous potential, while taking the game's popularity to new heights. The Open was a remarkable example of what Woods can do, and it is entirely possible that he will get even better. Right now, Woods does not even have a consistent rival, sitting alone at the top, pushing himself to new heights.</p>
        <p>That is a daunting fact for the world's other top players, but Woods seems to control his own destiny. When he plays his best, he either wins, or wins big. And that does not seem likely to change.</p>
