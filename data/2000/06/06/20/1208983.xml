        <p>BARTLE-Thomas P., Jr. The colleagues, employees and partner of Wesley, Brown &amp; Bartle, Inc. deeply grieve the loss of our company President and co-worker, Thomas P. Bartle, Jr. His indomitable optimism, unflagging spirit of adventure, literary skills and business inventiveness are irreplaceable. His unrelenting embraciveness of workforce diversity in the executive search business leaves a major impact and creates a metric for all of us to meet. Most cherished of all, however, was his pursuit of a love and beauty of living. It is in this regard that we are left with a void and memories that will always live on. Tom, you touched our hearts in ways that go far beyond having been your coworkers. You had an ability to make all around you feel so special and part of your extended family. Your intellectuality, sense of humor, natural grace and social charm, a life buoyancy that will continue to carry us along on a tide and be forever a ''BARTS'' legacy. Wesley Poriotis, Partner, Wesley, Brown &amp; Bartle, Inc.</p>
        <p>BARTLE-Thomas P., Jr., was a founder and member of the Board of Directors of ''The Center for Military and Private Sector Initiatives.'' With a mission to build a bridge between the military workforce and the private sector, The Center created a win-win scenario for both corporate America and transitioning military professionals alike. A veteran of the Air National Guard, Tom provided more than the business strategy for this newly formed, highly successful enterprise; he showed his passion and committment to those military men and women who have already given their all to their nation by helping them navigate to the next levels of their careers in the private sector. He cared about them. He was exceptionally proud of his service to his country, and it showed in his devotion to this cause. Tom, you will be missed by all of your colleagues here at The Center. You will always be the wind beneath our wings. Tony Watson, CEO, ''The Center for Military and Private Sector Initiatives''</p>
