        <p>You'll need a high decibel tolerance to enjoy ''Joe Fearless (A Fan Dance),'' and it will help if you're a sports nut, but this comedy about one man's lunatic obsession with basketball, ebulliently written by Liz Tuccillo and staged by Craig Carlisle at the edge of hysteria, is a true original. If your imagination has ever put you on the floor of Madison Square Garden with the galloping herds of the National Basketball Association thundering around you, get a ticket. It's probably the first theatrical production ever staged with a foul-shooting contest for the audience at intermission.</p>
        <p>And if the hormonally pumped-up atmosphere of the arena strikes you as ominous, in its theatrical artifice the play addresses that as well; you might find yourself echoing Marv Albert: ''Yessss!'' It's certainly the first time I've ever seen the gyrations of lithe actresses (playing cheerleaders here) elicit cries of ''Oh, Mama!'' from my fellow theatergoers.</p>

        <p>You'll need a high decibel tolerance to enjoy ''Joe Fearless (A Fan Dance),'' and it will help if you're a sports nut, but this comedy about one man's lunatic obsession with basketball, ebulliently written by Liz Tuccillo and staged by Craig Carlisle at the edge of hysteria, is a true original. If your imagination has ever put you on the floor of Madison Square Garden with the galloping herds of the National Basketball Association thundering around you, get a ticket. It's probably the first theatrical production ever staged with a foul-shooting contest for the audience at intermission.</p>
        <p>And if the hormonally pumped-up atmosphere of the arena strikes you as ominous, in its theatrical artifice the play addresses that as well; you might find yourself echoing Marv Albert: ''Yessss!'' It's certainly the first time I've ever seen the gyrations of lithe actresses (playing cheerleaders here) elicit cries of ''Oh, Mama!'' from my fellow theatergoers.</p>
        <p>Talk about a well-timed opening. The play, at the Atlantic Theater in Chelsea, opened last night during the N.B.A. championships. (It's independently produced, not an Atlantic Theater Company presentation.) It is a semicautionary, character-based fairy tale about Joe Donnelly, an overbearing devotee of a team called the K9's (read: Knicks), which, after decades of frustration, has reached the N.B.A. finals against the favored Breakers. A ne'er-do-well who has gone from job to job and whose marriage to his high school sweetheart has grown pallid, Joe has attached himself to the K9's in such desperate fashion that he is convinced that a loss to the Breakers will kill him.</p>
        <p>The action takes place during the final series, several of whose games are enacted by eight very sizable athletes-turned-actors on a stage that has been turned into a basketball court with regulation baskets at either end. And it traces Joe's fate after he delivers an impassioned defense of the K9's on talk radio, his life-and-death declaration turning him into a local celebrity.</p>
        <p>In an obvious but nonetheless effective gimmick, the play has alternative endings, depending on whether the star of the K9's, Jo-Jo Sharkey (an unusually pressure-filled role played by Michael Ealy) sinks a buzzer-beating jump shot.</p>
        <p>The egregious melodrama of all this is written and delivered with great good cheer, but the play isn't merely fluffy. The chaos, bordering on glandular fury, that professional sports in general and basketball in particular cultivate is a genuine subject here. And the seductiveness of the arena setting, its resonant repercussions in the psyches of fans who have little else to cling to, gives the show its underlying discord.</p>
        <p>The theme is helped immeasurably by the performance of Michael Leydon Campbell as Joe, whose fiercely coiled, loony-bird turn here never lets go of a credible grounding in ordinary despair; he's the kind of guy who feels left out in a win-at-all-costs culture, the kind of guy who is reminded by the sweaty, sexy, cacophanous drumbeat of pro sports of everything he is not.</p>
        <p>In the second act, the show acknowledges his recognition of this in some sentimental dialogue, but it is handled with dignity by Mr. Campbell and the other actors, most notably Julie Dretzin as his wife, Linda.</p>
        <p>And Ms. Tuccillo never lets her serious satire slip away entirely. In perhaps the play's most complicated emotional sequence, Linda, an ex-cheerleader who is sadly flummoxed by her husband's immersion in a fantasy world, resorts to enacting cheers in front of him, using mop heads as pom-poms.</p>
        <p>It is a legitimately touching moment, nearly too much, but reclaimed at the brink of sogginess by the cheer she recalls from the old days -- ''Kill Kill/Hate Hate/Murder Murder/Mutilate'' -- and the stunned expression on Ms. Dretzin's face when she realizes what she's said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tuccillo knows her terrain. Basketball fans will recognize references in her script to famous moments in basketball history, like Willis Reed's comeback from injury in the 1970 championship finals and Chris Webber's ill-advised timeout call in the final minute of the 1993 college championship game.</p>
        <p>She's also created characters who are marvelous sendups, including the hepped-up, chest-bumping players whose cliche-ridden macho attitude in interviews is skillfully mimicked by the actors, a television interviewer prone to asking embarrassing questions in the smug guise of journalistic courage and a talk-show host with the self-importance of a big fish in a small pond. The latter two are played by Nathan Dean with a joyous sense of parody; he looks a little like NBC's Bob Costas and sounds a lot like WFAN's Mad Dog Russo.</p>
        <p>Even with its strengths, the script is overshadowed here by Mr. Carlisle's relentlessly vibrant staging, which keeps the noise level cranked up and 21 actors shuffling on and off the stage in nearly constant motion. Helped by the remarkable choreography of Taro Alexander in enacting ball games -- it includes slam-dunking, pick-setting, behind-the-back passing, jump-shooting and shot-blocking (Mr. Alexander knows the importance of good defense) -- Mr. Carlisle places Joe, often on his living room couch as he watches the game on television, smack in the middle of the action. He uses the cheerleaders (who seem to have been cast for teenage looks and un-self-conscious brazenness) as a kind of chorus, their elastic, swivel-hipped dances and overtly erotic chanting providing an undercurrent of unseemliness that is calculatedly tough to resist.</p>
        <p>The result is both entertainment of a high-energy stripe and, particularly for a show that begins with an actor singing the national anthem, a surreptitious critique of a contemporary American subculture that is much in evidence but has been resistant to effective dramatization. Like a bench warmer turned hero, this is an unheralded show that shoots and scores.</p>
