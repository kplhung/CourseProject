        <p>The audit was routine, but the findings were chaotic.</p>
        <p>Ninety-seven boxes of unprocessed papers were stacked on the desks and floor of the Brooklyn Office of the City Register, which records real estate documents. Inside were piles of uncashed checks totaling around $26 million in real estate fees paid to the city.</p>
        <p>The city comptroller and the Department of Finance announced the discovery yesterday after a six-month audit of the Brooklyn office.</p>
        <p>Nick Paolucci, a spokesman for City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, called the office's problems ''pretty severe,'' echoing the findings of the audit, which noted that the unprocessed checks were a ''serious violation'' of a rule that cash receipts be deposited on the same business day.</p>
        <p>And the mistakes were costly.</p>
        <p>The city lost nearly $294,000 in interest because the checks had not been deposited, the audit found. The audit report said that 112 checks worth $36,395 had been refused by the bank because they were more than six months old. A study of transactions found that 10 percent included errors ranging from an underpayment of $29 to an overpayment of $39.</p>
        <p>The audit was prompted by a surge of business and not by any suspicion of wrongdoing, Mr. Paolucci said. The Office of the City Register, overseen by the Department of Finance, handled $1.1 billion in fees and taxes in the last fiscal year; each day the Brooklyn office (there is an office in each borough except Staten Island) handles 1,000 transactions and takes in $1 million.</p>
        <p>''In this booming economy, lots of those transactions were happening, and a backlog occurred,'' Mr. Paolucci said.</p>
        <p>In an unusual arrangement, the Department of Finance was informed of the findings as the audit proceeded. As a result, the audit report notes, 10 of its 12 recommendations, like assigning more staff to reduce the backlog, had already been implemented by the time the audit was released.</p>
        <p>''The bottom line here is, serious problems were found and serious problems were promptly corrected,'' Mr. Paolucci said.</p>
        <p>After the audit began in December, the city demoted two officials who supervised the agency. Joy A. Bobrow, the city registrar, was reassigned to the legal affairs division of the Department of Finance on Feb. 13, and Ronald Douglas, the deputy city registrar in charge of the Brooklyn office, was transferred to the taxpayer assistant unit, said Jim Moses, a department spokesman.  Ms. Bobrow's salary was reduced to $65,107 from $70,964, and Mr. Douglas's to $47,000 from $52,376. No other action was taken against them, Mr. Moses said.</p>
        <p>The audit also found 11 types of clerical or procedural errors, including a lack of internal controls to ensure that the department collected the revenues it should. At each step in the recording process, the audit found, a document would receive a new identifying number, thus making it almost impossible to trace a single transaction from start to finish.</p>
        <p>Each city agency is audited once every four years. In 1997, the Office of Vital Records, which handles requests for birth and death certificates, was found to have $272,000 in undeposited checks and money orders, a similar offense, but involving a much smaller amount of money.</p>
        <p>This audit was distinguished not just by sizable sums, but by close cooperation, officials said. Mr. Hevesi and Andrew S. Eristoff, who became finance commissioner a year ago, congratulated each other for what Mr. Eristoff called an ''innovative, collaborative approach.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Paolucci said that the city was changing procedures for handling documents and payments at all the city registrar offices.</p>
