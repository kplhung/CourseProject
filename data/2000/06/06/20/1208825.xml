        <p>You know things have changed in the decorous game of golf when spectators paint their faces in orange and black and hoot and holler as if they were watching the New York Jets. Of course there is always excitement in the gallery when Tiger Woods is playing, but Sunday at the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach was something special, mainly because Woods was something special. Crushing 350-yard drives, lofting wonderful recoveries from the rough, putting with supreme confidence, Woods won the U. S. Open with a 12-under-par 272 and a 15-stroke margin over his nearest competitor. This was the lowest score in relation to par in Open history, and the largest margin of victory in any of golf's four ''majors'' in the history of the game.</p>

        <p>You know things have changed in the decorous game of golf when spectators paint their faces in orange and black and hoot and holler as if they were watching the New York Jets. Of course there is always excitement in the gallery when Tiger Woods is playing, but Sunday at the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach was something special, mainly because Woods was something special. Crushing 350-yard drives, lofting wonderful recoveries from the rough, putting with supreme confidence, Woods won the U. S. Open with a 12-under-par 272 and a 15-stroke margin over his nearest competitor. This was the lowest score in relation to par in Open history, and the largest margin of victory in any of golf's four ''majors'' in the history of the game.</p>
        <p>It was also Woods's third victory in a major - only the British Open title has eluded him - and one has to think back to his first big victory, the 1997 Masters, to find a comparable blowout. Woods, then a 21-year-old rookie, virtually shrank Augusta National into a pitch-and-putt course on his way to an 18-under-par 270, a Masters record. But this victory may have been even more impressive, because Pebble Beach did not play easily. The average per-round score was a shade over 75, the highest for any Open since Oakmont in 1983.</p>
        <p>Woods's transcendent performance recalled Bobby Jones's observation after he had watched a young Jack Nicklaus dominate Augusta National in 1965. ''He plays a game with which I am not familiar,'' Jones said. Woods's competitors are now saying the same thing about him, freely admitting that on his best days, he is untouchable. Fortunately for them, and probably for the game of golf as well, there are some days when Woods is merely mortal. But they seem to be dwindling.</p>
