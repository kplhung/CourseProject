        <p>A police officer on trial on charges of lying about what he saw in a Brooklyn police station when Abner Louima was savagely tortured there lied to federal agents investigating the case to avoid the unsettling prospect of testifying against his peers, a prosecutor said in closing arguments yesterday.</p>
        <p>But a defense lawyer, in his own closing argument, said the officer, Francisco Rosario, was nothing more than a frightened policeman who committed a mistake, not a crime, by giving bad information to the agents. Officer Rosario, the lawyer said, is now being prosecuted because his version of the truth did not conform to the version offered by an ambitious and overly zealous prosecution.</p>
        <p>The closing statements in the trial -- the third to have stemmed from the attack against Mr. Louima on Aug. 9, 1997, when he was sodomized with a broken broom handle inside the 70th Precinct station house -- encapsulated the charges that have pervaded testimony since it began on June 5. No one has argued that Officer Rosario took part in the assault on Mr. Louima or its ensuing coverup; both sides have acknowledged that he was only inside the station house because he and his partner, Rolando Aleman, were doing paperwork for a man arrested for having a gun on the streets of the 70th Precinct that night.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the government has contended that, acting out of self-absorption, Officer Rosario lied to the government agents to extricate himself from an investigation that he could have helped immensely. Officer Rosario has been accused of saying he was not inside the station house arrest room when Mr. Louima was tossed into a cell there moments after the assault. Although he eventually confessed that he was in the room, the government asserts that he lied again by saying that Officer Thomas Bruder, not Justin A. Volpe, placed Mr. Louima, reeking of feces and with his pants at his ankles, into the cell.</p>
        <p>In March, Officer Bruder was convicted along with Officers Charles Schwarz and Thomas Wiese of plotting to cover up the assault. Mr. Volpe pleaded guilty in May 1999 to committing the attack, interrupting a trial in which Mr. Schwarz, too, was eventually found to have participated in the assault.</p>
        <p>In their summations yesterday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, prosecutors said Officer Rosario and Officer Aleman, who has already pleaded guilty in the case, lied to the agents because they did not want ''to be labeled as rats,'' as Richard Faughnan, an assistant United States attorney, put it.</p>
        <p>''They did not want to appear as government witnesses in the Louima case,'' Mr. Faughnan said. ''It did not matter that the cop they were protecting had committed one of most depraved acts of brutality in memory, if not in the history of the New York City Police Department.''</p>
        <p>Over the course of two trials, three grand jury appearances and numerous interviews with local and federal investigators, witnesses in the case, including Mr. Louima himself, have altered crucial aspects of their accounts several times. Officer Rosario was no different from these witnesses except that his version of events did not match the prosecution's, his lawyer, Raymond Granger, said.</p>
        <p>''Frank Rosario is not here today because he lied to the government,'' Mr. Granger added. ''He is here today because he refused to lie to the government. He refused to get into lock step with what other witnesses said.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Granger, who was once a federal prosecutor himself, went on to accuse the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States attorney's office of tailoring the testimony of their witnesses to fit their theory of the case -- that Mr. Volpe alone led Mr. Louima to the holding cell moments after the attack.</p>
        <p>''The truth becomes a casualty when a law enforcement agency becomes too convinced of the righteousness of its cause,'' he said. ''People were demanding justice, and the F.B.I. was going to give it. But maybe egos and ambition got involved, too.''</p>
        <p>In his rebuttal, Alan Vinegrad, the chief prosecutor in the case, replied: ''You know what that argument is? It's a joke. And not a funny one.''</p>
