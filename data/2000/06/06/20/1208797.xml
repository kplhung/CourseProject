        <p>African slaves brought the gift of syncopation to Peru, putting rhythmic crosscurrents behind the symmetrical melodies of Spanish and Native American songs. Susana Baca, who has spent much of her career collecting and preserving Afro-Peruvian songs, has decided not to isolate Peru's music from its kin across the hemisphere. On Wednesday night she opened a three-night engagement at Joe's Pub with guest musicians from New York -- John Medeski on keyboards and Marc Ribot and David Byrne on guitars -- sitting in with her Peruvian band.</p>
        <p>In songs from her new album, ''Eco de Sombras'' (Luaka Bop), Ms. Baca sang about slave drivers and about the pains of love. Some songs had African words that had been eroded by time. Her voice rose above  troubles -- airy and clear, with a tinge of remembered sadness -- while syncopations ricocheted around her.</p>

        <p>African slaves brought the gift of syncopation to Peru, putting rhythmic crosscurrents behind the symmetrical melodies of Spanish and Native American songs. Susana Baca, who has spent much of her career collecting and preserving Afro-Peruvian songs, has decided not to isolate Peru's music from its kin across the hemisphere. On Wednesday night she opened a three-night engagement at Joe's Pub with guest musicians from New York -- John Medeski on keyboards and Marc Ribot and David Byrne on guitars -- sitting in with her Peruvian band.</p>
        <p>In songs from her new album, ''Eco de Sombras'' (Luaka Bop), Ms. Baca sang about slave drivers and about the pains of love. Some songs had African words that had been eroded by time. Her voice rose above  troubles -- airy and clear, with a tinge of remembered sadness -- while syncopations ricocheted around her.</p>
        <p>Many of the songs were in brisk six-beat rhythms, divided among the band's bassist and arranger, David Pinto, and two percussionists who played Peruvian instruments like cajon (wooden box) and checo (gourd) along with conga drums; Rafael Munoz plucked additional crosscurrents on guitar, shifting between the basic harmonies of folk music and complex chords suggesting samba and jazz.</p>
        <p>The band was deliberately sparse, with its quick, pinpoint accents leaving plenty of space around Ms. Baca's curving vocal lines. But its arrangements were also so complete that the additional musicians almost had to sneak their parts into the songs. Mr. Medeski added stealthy sustained chords from his keyboards; Mr. Byrne plucked unassuming parts on guitar or charango (small Andean guitar), sometimes hinting at African soukous. Mr. Ribot was bolder, bending blues phrases to fit the Peruvian songs. While Ms. Baca sang with serene assurance, the burdens of history and the heart gave way to the pleasures of rhythm.</p>
