        <p>A Supreme Court justice has rejected the city's request for a court order to banish gang members from a section of Queens frequented by prostitutes, saying the city failed to present convincing evidence that the gang members' activities were menacing enough to warrant suspending such a basic civil right.</p>
        <p>The Police Department had gone to court in February to ask that 21 members and associates of the Bloods street gang be barred at night from Queens Plaza, where authorities said gang members had come to control the prostitution trade.</p>
        <p>But in a decision dated Friday and released yesterday, Justice Arthur W. Lonschein of State Supreme Court in Queens said that, while prostitution was a clear nuisance, the city had provided little evidence that it was controlled by the Bloods or would be eradicated by such a ban.</p>
        <p>''It would certainly seem likely that the customers would continue to come to the area, '' he wrote, ''and that there are more than enough pimps and prostitutes available to accommodate them.''</p>
        <p>Police officials, who say the Bloods' role has led to violence in the neighborhood, said they are reviewing whether to appeal.</p>
        <p>The city's maneuver was believed to be the first attempt by New York authorities to use a court injunction to curtail gang-related crime. The tactic has been successfully employed in gang-ridden cities in California for more than a decade.</p>
        <p>Councilman Walter L McCaffrey, whose district includes Queens Plaza, said, ''The judge does not take notice of the fact that this strategy has sustained legal challenges around the country.''</p>
        <p>But Justice Lonschein said the circumstances in the city's case were quite different from the California cases. For one thing, he said, the alleged illegal activity in California, which included drive-by shootings and arson, was more serious. And even there, he said, authorities did not seek an outright geographical banishment, only a prohibition on gang members' associating in a particular neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''Having established the existence of a less serious situation,'' he said, ''the city proposes a more sweeping injunction.''</p>
        <p>Chris Dunn, a lawyer for the New York Civil Liberties Union, which filed papers on behalf of the defendants, praised the ruling. ''The Constitution does not permit the city to banish people from public streets even if they are alleged gang members,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The city in its papers had sought to bar the defendants from a 25-square block area near the Queensboro Bridge between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.</p>
        <p>Justice Lonschein said that while some of the women cited in the complaint had histories of prostitution, the city had offered little evidence to show that the men were actively involved. And even if they had presented stronger evidence, he said, he was not convinced the city should be using a civil tool to curb behavior that is more appropriately adjudicated in Criminal Court. In fact, the judge said he believed the city was trying to make an end run around the court because authorities were frustrated that prostitutes do not receive longer sentences.</p>
        <p>''The city has absolutely failed to prove its scandalous innuendo that the judges of the Criminal Courts have been unwilling to enforce the law,'' the judge wrote.</p>
        <p>Robert F. Messner, a lawyer who directs the Police Department's Civil Enforcement Unit, said: ''The city never complained about the Criminal Court in its paperwork. The suit is not about the Criminal Court.''</p>
