        <p>''The Orchid Show,'' a new suite of dances by Neta Pulvermacher, is clearly a way station on an exploratory journey from dark drama to lighter, more playful work. Performed by the Neta Dance Company on Friday night at the Kitchen, ''The Orchid Show'' takes the Israeli choreographer and her six immensely appealing dancers into the outer stratospheres of giddiness.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pulvermacher was inspired to explore the world of orchids by a track on ''Apple Venus,'' a new album by the English rock band XTC. The music, a blend of the Beatles and Lovin' Spoonful, seems to have lifted Ms. Pulvermacher and carried her along on its sunny, wryly whimsical flow. A little of that whimsy goes a very long way in the dances, however, and they eventually look aimless and in need of editing.</p>

        <p>''The Orchid Show,'' a new suite of dances by Neta Pulvermacher, is clearly a way station on an exploratory journey from dark drama to lighter, more playful work. Performed by the Neta Dance Company on Friday night at the Kitchen, ''The Orchid Show'' takes the Israeli choreographer and her six immensely appealing dancers into the outer stratospheres of giddiness.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pulvermacher was inspired to explore the world of orchids by a track on ''Apple Venus,'' a new album by the English rock band XTC. The music, a blend of the Beatles and Lovin' Spoonful, seems to have lifted Ms. Pulvermacher and carried her along on its sunny, wryly whimsical flow. A little of that whimsy goes a very long way in the dances, however, and they eventually look aimless and in need of editing.</p>
        <p>The opening solo, for a fey Maile Okamura, sets the tone. There are moments of inspired invention in ''Apple Venus'' and ''The Orchid Show,'' which complete the trilogy. One such sequence occurs in ''Apple Venus'' when two dancers pat and milk a small white cutout of a sheep like cow, with tiny imaginary pails at the ready. The scampering little orchids are often charming as they nuzzle up to and disobey a voluble English orchid-fancier named Jill St. John (Jeremy Laverdure) in the final dance, set to music by composers including Satie, Ennio Morricone and Ms. Pulvermacher and Tami Stronach, with a text by Eric Hansen.</p>
        <p>The layering of humor, emotion and inventive movement in one strange but potent duet in ''Apple Venus,'' danced by Mr. Laverdure and the slyly anarchic Ms. Stronach, suggest where Ms. Pulvermacher may be heading. The company was completed by Brittany Reese, Christina Towle and the amusingly sleepy looking Jason Marchant. The bright, witty costumes were by Ms. Okamura, Ms. Pulvermacher and the other dancers. The pretty but lightweight video was by Grr-Riley Productions.</p>
