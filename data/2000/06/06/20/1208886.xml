        <p>ON sunny days, Mengistu Melesse, a sad-eyed stick figure of a man, drags a hose in front of the limestone town house at 20 East 65th Street, for him a vaunted house turned haunted house, and nourishes the conifers his vanished benefactor, Irene Silverman, planted in more positive times.</p>
        <p>''If she sees one wilted plant, Mrs. Silverman will go crazy,'' murmurs Mr. Melesse, 32, who still tends to slip, after two years without her, into thinking of his employer in the present tense.

        <p>ON sunny days, Mengistu Melesse, a sad-eyed stick figure of a man, drags a hose in front of the limestone town house at 20 East 65th Street, for him a vaunted house turned haunted house, and nourishes the conifers his vanished benefactor, Irene Silverman, planted in more positive times.</p>
        <p>''If she sees one wilted plant, Mrs. Silverman will go crazy,'' murmurs Mr. Melesse, 32, who still tends to slip, after two years without her, into thinking of his employer in the present tense. It's more comforting that way, making it easier to fall asleep in his spartan caretaker's quarters in the basement, where his only company is a television, a teddy bear and the security system.</p>
        <p>''She was the soul of this house,'' he says. ''Without her, it's quiet.''</p>
        <p>Eerily full of furniture and plants, but empty of humans except the bereft Mr. Melesse, whose American dream came true the day he met Mrs. Silverman eight years ago and, he fears, died when she disappeared on July 5, 1998.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what's going to happen with me,'' says Mr. Melesse (pronounced meh-LAH-see), who left Africa -- and political persecution -- for the United States in 1990, found a surrogate mother in Mrs. Silverman in 1992, and this spring showed up in criminal court numbed by stage fright, flabbergasted by the defense team's rote attempt to implicate him and motivated to perform one final task for his heroine. Mr. Melesse's exacting testimony helped prosecutors secure New York's first murder conviction without a body, confession or forensic proof. Her killers' sentencing is set for next Tuesday. But it has brought him minimal relief.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Silverman's photo, on a missing persons card, is still tucked under the glass top of the desk in the front hall: its implications are agonizing. ''She deserves a proper burial. She thought she would live to be 99. She had plans for her dream,'' he says, referring to the Coby Foundation, which she established in 1996 to honor her mother, an embroiderer who was nicknamed Coby after a favorite radio character.</p>
        <p>''She gave me so much,'' he says, eyes fogging over. ''And I never got to say goodbye.''</p>
        <p>When he waters the greenery outside the 65th Street town house, he will invariably feel a tap on the shoulder. When he turns with customary politeness, manners curried by an upper-crust Ethiopian upbringing before the coup that toppled the Selasse regime (he recalls dead bodies in the street as he walked to school) and rendered him a refugee, yet another passer-by will ask the inevitable: ''Did they ever find her?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Melesse just shakes his head. ''What a shame,'' is what the curiosity-seekers say as they pass the house where Mrs. Silverman was apparently strangled two years ago by a pair of tenants who turned out to be con artists, Sante Kimes and her son Kenneth. They coveted the widow's $7.7 million home.</p>
        <p>Mr. Melesse was at a soccer tournament in Atlanta the day she was ambushed, his first vacation in six years, and he sorely regrets taking it. And he was not on duty the day his pleasantly eccentric boss rented out 1B, an apartment just steps from hers, to the furtive man he now calls Mr. Death. It was a Sunday in June, concierge's day off, and Mr. Melesse was visiting his sister in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>WHEN he returned that night, a ''do not disturb'' sign was posted on the new tenants' door, and Mr. Melesse's tiny employer, a onetime ballerina from New Orleans who danced her way from a Radio City chorus line into the prosperous marriage that brought her to this address, was waiting in the hall with her index finger pointed toward 1B.</p>
        <p>''I don't like him,'' she told Mr. Melesse. ''Keep your eye on him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Melesse didn't like what he saw: ''He spied on us; he hid from the security cameras when he came in the door.''</p>
        <p>The first time Mr. Melesse was buzzed through the imposing wooden door, he was a greengrocer's delivery boy, living with relatives in Jersey City and living off hot dogs. And he bore, instead of the usual 50-pound sack of potatoes, something exotic: a box brimming with cherries.</p>
        <p>''Imagine, a box of cherries brought me here,'' says Mr. Melesse, who for a few moments found himself alone in the most beautiful house he'd ever seen. Inside, a crystal chandelier illuminated a curving staircase and black marble floors: ''It looked like a movie then. Like this,'' he adds, flicking on the lights.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Silverman tipped him $20 that day, and a week later, after learning of the death of his father in Ethiopia, he was back at her door on his delivery route. They chatted. She noticed he was distraught. She offered him a job, doubling his salary, and he surprised them both by saying something very personal.</p>
        <p>''My heart was pounding,'' he recalls. ''I told her, 'If you'll be like a mother to me, I'll be like a son to you.' The rest of the day, I carried dirt up to the terrace for her garden. That was a test, to see if I wanted to stay.'' Three years after hiring him, she trusted him with her banking. In March 1998, she paid his tuition for computer classes, assured him Coby had a job for him. ''She opened the door for me out of nowhere. Who am I? I'm nobody, but here I am in a $10 million house. She was a great, great person. They can't kill this person.''</p>
        <p>The day Mr. Melesse left Ethiopia, his father took him aside and briefed him on America: he told him it could provide everything, the good and the bad. It did.</p>
