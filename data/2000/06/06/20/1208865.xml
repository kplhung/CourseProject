        <p>Tiger Woods's face, biceps, torso, feet, clubs and Nike ball were such riveting images on Sunday at the United States Open that it's a wonder NBC showed any other golfer at work on the grass of Pebble Beach.</p>
        <p>After all, Woods's 15-stroke victory was ''the greatest performance in golf history,'' said Johnny Miller, NBC's lead analyst, ''maybe the best in sports history.''</p>
        <p>Other golfers were present, but playing cameo roles so tangential that NBC should have employed a corner box to display Tiger's reactions when mortals named Ernie, Padraig and Miguel rudely intruded on his historic Face Time.</p>
        <p>Didn't it seem unfair to see anyone but Tiger in a field packed with golfers who, Miller said, ''drift out of the way and don't play their normal game'' against Tiger?</p>
        <p>''Even with an eight-shot lead, you don't want to stop watching him,'' Roger Maltbie, an NBC commentator, said on Sunday. Exactly.</p>
        <p>When NBC cut to a par putt by Nick Faldo, I wondered: Tiger could be clog dancing on the eighth green. Kill this ridiculous shot!</p>
        <p>NBC knew other golfers were out there, competing in a lesser universe, incapable of lifting its ratings. But NBC had to show them, probably by contract, yet with reluctance.</p>
        <p>Tiger was irresistible, stretching a 10-stroke third-round lead into a 15-stroke rout. Once he teed off, 2 hours 10 minutes after NBC's golf day began at 1:30 p.m., Eastern time, Tiger logged astonishing attention.</p>
        <p>NBC cut to Woods 407 times, to see him tee off and putt, to watch his reactions, to analyze him in replays, to see him breathe. NBC followed him as he marched from green to tee, from tee to fairway, from fairway to green. During his perambulations, NBC surely failed to show shots that were important to other golfers. But on this day, they mattered not.</p>
        <p>Inexplicably, NBC missed Woods's tap-in at the fourth hole -- he was approaching the ball -- to cut to a wedge shot by Lee Westwood. And Tiger's tap-in on the ninth hole was deemed less important than a Bobby Clampett birdie try!</p>
        <p>NBC's priorities were nearly always correct. When Ernie Els, Woods's partner, putted, he was usually placed in a two-shot with Tiger to the side or in the background.</p>
        <p>On the sixth hole, NBC lingered 90 seconds through a six-angle setup before Tiger putted for par. On the 17th, NBC stayed with Woods nonstop (except for brief cuts to his mother and to his ball) for 15 separate shots as he walked from the tee to the bunker where his first shot lay.</p>
        <p>On the 18th, NBC lingered on Tiger for 1 minute 15 seconds as he did nothing but stroll beside the ocean and the local flora and apply lip balm as he awaited Els's second shot.</p>
        <p>During his four-hour round, Tiger's Face Time totaled 93 minutes 23 seconds. That's 39 percent of the slot between 3:40 p.m. and 7:40 p.m. Whatever NBC carried before Tiger's round started was a prelude and shouldn't be counted in the ratings.</p>
        <p>Each time NBC found Woods, the camera stayed for an average of 13.7 seconds. The network found his mother four times, twice more than it showed Notah Begay III.</p>
        <p>What Woods's runaway victory proved is that viewers will watch even if they know that the outcome is obvious, like previously taped figure skating events that grab audiences despite foreknowledge of the results.</p>
        <p>NBC would certainly not have gotten an 8.8 overnight Nielsen rating on Sunday -- the highest such rating ever recorded for the United States Open -- had Stewart Cink been soaring to an astonishing 15-stroke victory. The rating was 11 percent above last year's final round, when Payne Stewart won by a stroke.</p>
        <p>But NBC's rating is puny compared with CBS's 15.8 overnight for the final round of Woods's 12-stroke victory at the Masters three years ago. (In that round, Woods's Face Time totaled 80 minutes 46 seconds.)</p>
        <p>When Woods won last year's P.G.A. Championship over Sergio Garcia by two strokes, CBS garnered a 7.7 overnight rating, up 26 percent from a year before.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the only factor that could have jazzed up NBC's Sunday rating was stiff competition through the 18th hole against a marquee rival.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the Tiger Woods show held up quite well during its one-hour encroachment into prime time, trouncing its competition. Golf peaked from 7 to 7:30 p.m. with a 12.2 rating, beating its closest rival, ''60 Minutes'' on CBS, which had an 8.1.</p>
        <p>NBC embraced the United States Open as if it were as dear a property as the National Basketball Association. When the second round was truncated on Friday, NBC ordered two hours of Saturday morning coverage. And although NBC was to leave the air at 8 that night, it stayed until 10:45, causing NBC to scuttle the prime-time showings of ''Alice in Wonderland'' and ''The Others.''</p>
        <p>For Saturday's prime time, NBC posted a 7.5 overnight rating.</p>
        <p>Only last month, in a tournament that lacked Woods atop the leader board, CBS left the Byron Nelson Classic at 6:38 p.m. rather than show the third hole of a sudden-death playoff won by Jesper Parnevik.</p>
        <p>The action was deemed a violation of CBS's PGA Tour contract, and the network vowed never to repeat its heinous act. It can leave by 7 o'clock, just not before.</p>
        <p>Naturally, if Woods were in a position to win, CBS would never have pre-empted a second of golf, even if it meant delaying a film about Jesus.</p>
        <p>Now NBC bequeaths Woods to ABC for the British Open next month from St. Andrews, a course Miller says is better suited to a Woods victory than Pebble Beach. If he succeeds, Tiger would provide star power well beyond that of Paul Lawrie, whose playoff victory last year produced a 4.8 final-round rating.</p>
