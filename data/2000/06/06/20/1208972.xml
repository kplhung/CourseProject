        <p>Vinny Testaverde is in the ninth month of rehabilitation from an Achilles' tendon injury that normally takes 8 to 12 months to heal. He said yesterday that he was ''not quite 100 percent,'' but thought he would be close by opening day.</p>
        <p>''I'm in a normal regular workout mode,'' said Testaverde, who was at the ESPN Zone restaurant to promote the Cadillac N.F.L. Golf Classic. ''The tendon has healed and I don't feel any problems there. Now, it's just getting my left calf as strong as my right. That may take awhile.''</p>

        <p>The worst thing that could happen, Testaverde said, is injuring his right foot. ''Once you injure one, you're at a higher percentage that you might injure the other, higher than anyone who didn't have a tear,'' Testaverde said.</p>
