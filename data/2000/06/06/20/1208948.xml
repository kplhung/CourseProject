      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article yesterday about ''children of Chernobyl'' visiting the United States for a summer of medical care and relaxation referred imprecisely to the number of deaths and illnesses caused by the accident at the nuclear plant in Ukraine in 1986. As was noted in a correction in this space on Saturday, referring to an article published on June 6, the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has said that 31 people died in the first weeks after the accident. Other estimates of deaths ultimately caused by it range from dozens to tens of thousands; estimates of illnesses range from hundreds to tens of thousands.</p>
