        <p>The Supreme Court performs a valuable if sometimes under-appreciated public service when it rises above politics and popular opinion to prevent harmful erosion of the First Amendment's wall between church and state. Yesterday the court admirably fulfilled that mission in refusing to permit organized student-led prayers before public high school football games.</p>
        <p>The 6-to-3 ruling, the court's most important school prayer decision in almost a decade, came in a closely watched case from Texas. It arose when a Mormon family and a Catholic family brought a lawsuit objecting to the Christian prayers offered by chaplains at school events. Trying to get around the constitutional bar on officially organized prayers, the district shifted it policies to have a student selected by a schoolwide election deliver a pregame ''message or invocation'' of his or her own choosing.</p>

        <p>The Supreme Court performs a valuable if sometimes under-appreciated public service when it rises above politics and popular opinion to prevent harmful erosion of the First Amendment's wall between church and state. Yesterday the court admirably fulfilled that mission in refusing to permit organized student-led prayers before public high school football games.</p>
        <p>The 6-to-3 ruling, the court's most important school prayer decision in almost a decade, came in a closely watched case from Texas. It arose when a Mormon family and a Catholic family brought a lawsuit objecting to the Christian prayers offered by chaplains at school events. Trying to get around the constitutional bar on officially organized prayers, the district shifted it policies to have a student selected by a schoolwide election deliver a pregame ''message or invocation'' of his or her own choosing.</p>
        <p>For the majority, this resort to a student surrogate could not hide the school's role in organizing the religious worship. Nor could it overcome the intrinsic risk of coercion in holding prayer exercises in elementary and secondary schools -- whether during regular class hours or at after-school events. ''The 'degree of school involvement' makes it clear that the pregame prayers bear 'the imprint of the state and thus put school-age children who objected in an untenable position,' '' wrote Justice John Paul Stevens, quoting language the court used eight years ago in its ruling outlawing clergy-led prayer at graduation.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush, who filed a brief supporting the pregame prayers, expressed disappointment yesterday with the decision. So did three members of the court -- Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas -- whose dissent described the majority opinion as bristling ''with hostility to all things religious in public life.''</p>
        <p>Chief Justice Rehnquist should know better than to confuse the majority's attempt to protect against state establishment of religion with opposition to religion generally. The court, as Justice Stevens wrote, ''recognizes the important role that public worship plays in many communities.'' The new ruling merely upholds the principle that ''religious activity in public schools, as elsewhere, must comport with the First Amendment.''</p>
