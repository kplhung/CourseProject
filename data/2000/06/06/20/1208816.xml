        <p>Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. And that's pretty much it for the Broadway production of Shakespeare's ''Macbeth,'' starring Kelsey Grammer in the title role.</p>
        <p>The producers of the ill-received revival said yesterday that they would close the production on Sunday, five weeks before its planned closing, after being battered by most of the city's theater critics.</p>
        <p>The production, which opened on Thursday at the Music Box Theater on West 45th Street, will have played only eight previews and 13 regular performances, making it one of the shortest runs in recent years. Having opened just after the Tonys -- officially the end of the old Broadway season and the start of the new one -- ''Macbeth'' also takes its place as both the first show to open in the 2000-2001 season and the first show of that season to close. It will have lost some $1.5 million.</p>
        <p>The production, staged by the British director Terry Hands, nearly closed in Boston last month after mixed-to-poor reviews but continued on to New York after Mr. Grammer assured producers that he would help bear any financial losses they incurred.</p>
        <p>But the reviews in New York were no better. Writing in The New York Times, Ben Brantley called it a ''blunt-witted new production'' with ''a plodding quality that matches the lumbering and circular steps with which the actors have been encouraged to move.'' Other critics were less kind.</p>
        <p>In published interviews, Mr. Grammer said he knew it was a professional risk to take on ''Macbeth,'' which is widely considered one of Shakespeare's most difficult plays and is the subject of much theatrical mythology. (Superstitious theater professionals call it ''the Scottish play,'' rather than evoking the legendary bad luck that seems to follow productions of it.)</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Grammer said he had long wanted to play the role, for which he was an understudy in a 1981 production at Lincoln Center.</p>
        <p>On the surface, at least, his classical credentials did not seem completely lacking; after all, he attended though he did not graduate from the Juilliard acting program, and he received good notices for his performance as Cassio in a 1982 production of ''Othello'' with James Earl Jones.</p>
        <p>With the early closing, however, Mr. Grammer's stage credits are likely to compare unfavorably with his career in television, during which he created the character of Dr. Frasier W. Crane, the fussy and fitfully unhappy psychiatrist on the long-running NBC sitcom ''Cheers.''</p>
        <p>He was a regular on that show for 10 years -- one year for every day ''Macbeth'' will have been open on Broadway -- before spinning off the character into its own successful series, ''Frasier,'' which he is still starring in on NBC.</p>
        <p>Yesterday neither the show's producers nor Mr. Grammer would comment on the early closing, which will probably spare the show further losses. But perhaps an explanation can be drawn from the play itself.</p>
        <p>''If it were done when 'tis done,'' says Macbeth in Act I, ''then 'twere well it were done quickly.''</p>
