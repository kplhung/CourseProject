        <p>With the stern visage of Leon Trotsky glaring from a huge screen behind the lectern, Dr. Joseph Lykken, a particle physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill., launched into his best parody of a coffeehouse radical railing against the counterrevolutionary tendencies of the old guard.</p>
        <p>''Among the many crimes of the bourgeois overlords of HEP and their running dog lackeys is to have allowed the misapprehension among students (and the public) that particle physics is almost done,'' he declared in a manifesto delivered near the end of an international conference on particle physics last August at Stanford.</p>
        <p>''HEP,'' in the jargon, is high-energy physics, the attempt to use powerful particle accelerators to study the tiniest pieces of matter. Dr. Lykken was tired of hearing some of his own colleagues lament that this centuries-long pursuit had run out of intellectual steam and was coming to an end.</p>
        <p>''Trotsky was right,'' Dr. Lykken proclaimed as the image of the dour Bolshevik and advocate of never-ending political upheaval grimaced through his goatee. ''In fact high-energy physics is exciting and will remain exciting precisely because it exists in a state of permanent revolution.''</p>
        <p>After years of impasse, the study of subatomic particles has been undergoing something of a renaissance. A new generation of physicists is stretching its collective mind and coming up with radical ideas about how the universe may be constructed. Some are proposing the existence of extra dimensions. Others are building bridges between islands of thought that once seemed hopelessly remote, rekindling hopes of a unified ''theory of everything'' that would explain all the particles and forces of nature. Still others are looking for the very building blocks of space and time. And, most surprising of all, the young physicists are finding ways to test indirectly even some of the wildest ideas with experiments.</p>
        <p>''This is a very exciting time in high-energy physics,'' said Dr. Nima Arkani-Hamed, a 28-year-old physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, whose ideas on extra dimensions have helped inspire a rethinking of superstring theory, the attempt to explain matter and energy in terms of tiny vibrating strings. ''Three years ago, everyone thought that all possibilities for what one could imagine seeing at high energies had been realized,'' he said. ''This new work shows that you can see completely different bizarre things.'' The ''whole shebang,'' he said, might be ''right around the corner.''</p>
        <p>Maria Spiropulu, a 30-year-old physicist who is getting her Ph.D. in August, is searching for the hypothetical extra dimensions by poring over data from accelerator experiments at Fermilab. ''Whether it is extra dimensions or extra-anything that will lead us to answers about how nature swings, we can only find out really by means of experiment,'' she said. ''If it's not extra dimensions, it will be something as crazy as extra dimensions.''</p>
        <p>The charge is being led by people in their 20's and early 30's, who chose to enter the field in the thick of the malaise. Ideas have been coming so fast that Dr. Lykken, part of an older generation who got Ph.D.'s back in the early 1980's, is convinced that physics, far from being over, has barely begun. ''There is no reason to imagine that we are near the end of this process,'' he said in his lecture, ''barring the collapse of our civilization -- by which I mean, our funding gets cut off.''</p>
        <p>Though exaggerating for effect and preaching a bit to the choir, he was countering what until recently was a growing sense of gloom. Particle physics, many wistfully believed, may have reached its pinnacle some 30 years earlier with the soaring piece of architecture called the standard model. According to this theory, the culmination of decades of theorizing and experimentation, matter is made from two kinds of particles: lightweight ''leptons,'' like the electron and neutrino, and quarks. Animating these building blocks, causing them to join together and break apart, are three kinds of forces: electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear reactions. The forces are also made from particles, called quanta. The photon, for example, carries electromagnetism.</p>
        <p>Impressive as the standard model has been, surviving one experimental challenge after another, there is much that it has not explained. It does not mention the fourth force, gravity, described by a completely different theory called general relativity. Nor can the standard model say why the hundreds of different particles come in such a bewildering variety of masses, or why there are 4 forces instead of 5, or 27 or 43.</p>
        <p>In fact, the standard model seemed, when it was devised, like a rest stop on a march toward something greater. But in the succeeding years, attempts to go beyond it hit one snag after another. The feeling of discouragement reached its peak in 1993, with the death of the superconducting super collider, a powerful accelerator thought necessary to test ideas about the universe. The tunnels that had been partially dug to house the accelerator were abandoned. One company inquired about using them as a mushroom farm.</p>
        <p>In its January millennium issue, Wired magazine, a barometer of what is supposed to be technologically trendy, listed quarks among tired old 20th-century ideas that would fade. ''Particle physics has been gut-shot ever since the spectacular failure of the superconducting super collider,'' wrote Bruce Sterling, a science fiction writer who compiled the list. ''The next generation of physicists is going where the real money is -- computer science. At the end of the 20th century, the only thing more pitifully dated than being an atom splitter is being a rocket scientist.''</p>
        <p>Before the recent revival, even some of the physicists themselves feared becoming scientific has-beens. ''There were a lot of depressed people running around,'' Dr. Lykken said.</p>
        <p>Some had put their hopes in superstring theory, which holds that beneath the level of quarks and leptons are tinier entities called strings. For the idea to work, the superstrings seemed to need the extra wiggle room afforded by an inconceivable space consisting of nine dimensions (10 counting time). But to explain why humans experience only three of the dimensions, theorists were forced to assume that the others must each be curled up too tiny to detect. Superstring theory, some critics retorted, was more like medieval theology than science: reality would be explained through pure reason without the need for experiment. Adding to the frustration, there seemed to be five candidate string theories with no sign of which one explained this universe.</p>
        <p>Outside of superstring theory, more traditional approaches to soup up the standard model also failed. Quarks come in three different types whimsically called ''colors'': red, green and blue. Maybe, some hoped, an even more abstract quality called technicolor would solve the problems. Or perhaps a concept called supersymmetry, which predicted a mirror world of particles with names like squarks and sneutrinos, would plug the gaps in understanding. But either the ideas were wrong and the particles did not exist, or physicists would need far more powerful accelerators -- and brains -- to find them.</p>
        <p>Then, in the mid-1990's, the conceptual logjam began to break. The first wave of excitement came when theorists realized that the five different string theories were just varying perspectives of the same underlying idea. Five blind men had been looking at the same elephant.</p>
        <p>Building on this and other ideas, a 29-year-old Argentinian theorist named Juan Maldacena made a conceptual leap in 1997 that many hope will point to a more complete picture of physics. In a paper that caused a sensation among string theorists, he uncovered hints of unexpected links between superstring theory and the standard model. If he is right, then what seemed like two different theoretical worlds, each with a different language, might be reflections of a single underlying truth -- the ultimate theory.</p>
        <p>Dr. Maldacena's paper caused so much excitement that theorists at a string theory conference in Santa Barbara, Calif., literally danced for joy, grinding through the steps of the macarena, shouting physics-filled lyrics that climaxed with the refrain, ''Ehhh, Maldacena!''</p>
        <p>For all the light shed by Dr. Maldacena's conjecture, physicists were still left with the problem of how to prove the existence of the tiny dimensions. In 1998, Dr. Arkani-Hamed, then a 25-year-old Stanford postdoctoral researcher, suggested a possible way out. He and two colleagues -- another young physicist, Dr. Gia Dvali, and a senior Stanford professor, Dr. Savas Dimopoulos --  made the startling suggestion that at least one of the extra dimensions might be large enough to measure. What people had been thinking of as the universe may actually be part of something grander: a three-dimensional island floating inside a fourth dimension no more than a millimeter wide. (This may be somewhat easier to visualize if you think of this universe as a sheet of paper, a two-dimensional ''flatland'' light-years in length and breadth, floating inside a narrow sliver of space.)</p>
        <p>That sounds like a tight fit, but a millimeter is gargantuan compared with the prevailing idea that the hidden dimensions are 10 to the minus 32 millimeters in size -- smaller by a factor of 100 million trillion trillion. This sprawling higher dimension has gone unnoticed, the three scientists proposed, because the particles that make up our universe are stuck to the surface of the island, barred from entering the surrounding space. But gravitons, the carriers of gravity, can trickle into the netherworld. This suggested ways to search for the extra dimension by looking for hints of gravitational leaks.</p>
        <p>The next year, two more theorists, Dr. Lisa Randall and Dr. Raman Sundrum, both in their mid-30's, devised another theory in which the universe is surrounded by a higher dimension, this one infinite in size. Evidence is also being sought in accelerator data.</p>
        <p>''These ideas don't have to be realized in nature,'' Dr. Arkani-Hamed said. ''But if they are, this will run counter to the whole idea of things being at an end and physics being reduced to philosophy. I think it's amazing that it took 20 years until the very simple but certainly radical ideas that we propose sort of crashed the standard model and made it possible that traditional particle physics could be string theory in 10 years.''</p>
        <p>Recently, two 30-year-old Stanford physicists, Dr. Shamit Kachru and Dr. Eva Silverstein have been using large extra dimensions and other ideas to try to explain a glaring cosmology problem. Scientists are becoming increasingly convinced that a strange energy field described as  the cosmological constant is boosting the expansion of the universe, causing it to accelerate. Particle physics, as it is now understood, explains how this kind of inflation can occur, but it predicts that the phenomenon should be far more intense -- that the universe should be growing very rapidly, or rapidly collapsing on itself. ''It looks like we are really missing a crucial piece of physics here,'' Dr. Kachru said.</p>
        <p>The remedies they suggest are still very tentative, but Dr. Silverstein says the joy is in the chase. ''It can be quite thrilling to pursue an idea one finds exciting, or simply to understand something about physics better,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The reigning idea of the quantum revolution in the early 20th century was that energy was not smooth and continuous but came in discrete packets, the quanta. Another challenge of physics is to see if time and space also have an internal structure. ''I always thought that if we could look really close, space and space-time would turn out to be not smooth and geometrical, as in Einstein's theory, but 'bumpy' and made up of building blocks,'' said Dr. Fotini Markopoulou Kalamara, 29, a researcher at Imperial College in London. She is part of a group trying to show that space and time are built from mathematical units called spin nets.</p>
        <p>With a slightly different turn of fate she might not have gone into physics. As an undergraduate she spent a summer at a national physics laboratory in England: ''My supervisor there told me many times that I should not go into particle physics, that the era of accelerators and great experiments was all over and it was a dying field,'' Dr. Markopoulou said. ''In fact, he advised me to do biology, which he thought was the science of the future.''</p>
        <p>The lesson of all this, Dr. Arkani-Hamed said, is that theorists should never assume they have already thought of every possibility for how the world works. ''What it says to me is that you should never underestimate the feebleness of the human imagination,'' he said. ''We're really struggling in the dark.''</p>
