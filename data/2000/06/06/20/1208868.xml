        <p>Aiming directly at the voters in the center, Republicans turned their first official platform meeting today into a showcase for the party's ideas on education, Medicare and Social Security.</p>
        <p>Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, the platform committee chairman, asserted that the panel would produce a ''very fresh, very visionary'' platform that would seal the Republicans' reputation as the reform-minded party of the future.</p>
        <p>But away from the harmony on stage, the party's ideological fault lines on abortion were apparent. Anti-abortion advocates held a news conference outside the meeting hall in which they called on party leaders to live up to their promises and retain a strong anti-abortion plank; several of the advocates said they were confident the party would do so.</p>
        <p>The anti-abortion advocates also urged Gov. George W. Bush, the expected nominee, to name a running mate who opposed abortion. ''If Governor Bush selects a pro-choice running mate, it will be a very serious strategic mistake,'' said Peggy Lehner, president of Dayton Right to Life.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson and the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Jim Nicholson, reiterated to reporters that, in accord with Mr. Bush's wishes, they did not expect the platform's language on abortion to change. The platform calls for an end to legalized abortion and the appointment of judges who respect ''the sanctity of innocent human life.'' Republicans who support abortion rights are struggling, once again, to change that language.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nicholson, citing Mr. Bush's deep popularity in the party and his ability to unify Republicans, said he did not expect a fight over abortion on the floor of the convention.</p>
        <p>Aside from that, one of the major themes of the day was the need for change and fresh ideas. Mr. Thompson said he expected extensive revisions to the platform to deal with rapidly changing issues -- including electronic commerce, biotechnology and women's health -- and to reflect the focus of the Bush campaign on issues like education.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson noted that he did not expect the party to call for the abolition of the Department of Education, one of several federal agencies that the 1996 Republican platform, a deeply conservative document, wanted to dismantle.</p>
        <p>Today's meeting, held in a state that generally plays a pivotal role in presidential elections, was a careful selection of panel discussions that highlighted parents and principals, health care experts and pension analysts and citizens from Dayton itself.</p>
        <p>Republican officials heard from a Milwaukee mother, Pilar Gomez, who talked of her ''empowering'' experiences with that city's Parental Choice Program, which enabled her to use publicly financed vouchers to send her children to private school.</p>
        <p>''Quality education -- that should be a right, not a privilege,'' Ms. Gomez said.</p>
        <p>Republicans also heard from officials in Arizona, Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania concerning their efforts to inject more flexibility and accountability into public schools.</p>
        <p>''Our party rejects the notion that the creator placed talent in children based on their skin color or their wealth,'' said Lisa Graham Keegan, superintendent of public instruction in Arizona.</p>
        <p>The Republicans also focused on the need to ''reform'' Social Security and Medicare. Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, a co-chairman of the platform committee, argued that Medicare was in profound need of modernization, in part because of the inadequacy of its benefit package, which lacks prescription drug coverage.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Frist argued that adding that benefit must be part of an ''overall reform of the system,'' and the creation of a new health care marketplace to allow private plans to compete with traditional Medicare for the elderly.</p>
        <p>About 100 people attended today's event, held at Sinclair Community College in downtown Dayton, and several of the most attentive were from various interest groups.</p>
        <p>Representatives of Republicans for Choice and the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition were on hand, although Republican leaders had earlier declared that abortion would not be the subject of any public hearings leading up to the convention.</p>
        <p>In a conciliatory gesture, an aide to Governor Thompson said tonight that at the next platform forum, to be held on Friday in Billings, Mont., one local representative from each side of the abortion issue would be scheduled to speak.</p>
