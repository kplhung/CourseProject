        <p>It's 8 a.m., and Diane Ruggiero is seated in a super-trendy patio restaurant in a hotel on Sunset Boulevard. Despite the early hour, most of the handful of diners are wearing dark glasses, dressed in black and keeping their cell phones handy.</p>
        <p>''Who are these people?'' whispered Ms. Ruggiero, a 29-year-old writer who just flew in from New Jersey. ''When I checked in I said: 'Give me a break! These people wouldn't last 15 minutes in New Jersey. I mean, I don't know these people.''</p>

        <p>It's 8 a.m., and Diane Ruggiero is seated in a super-trendy patio restaurant in a hotel on Sunset Boulevard. Despite the early hour, most of the handful of diners are wearing dark glasses, dressed in black and keeping their cell phones handy.</p>
        <p>''Who are these people?'' whispered Ms. Ruggiero, a 29-year-old writer who just flew in from New Jersey. ''When I checked in I said: 'Give me a break! These people wouldn't last 15 minutes in New Jersey. I mean, I don't know these people.''</p>
        <p>She will quite soon.</p>
        <p>After years of struggling as a writer and working as a waitress and bartender in and around the working- and middle-class North Jersey towns North Arlington and East Rutherford, Ms. Ruggiero (ROUGE-ear-oh)  has been plucked from obscurity to write and help produce a new autobiographical television comedy series, ''That's Life,'' on CBS. The show, about a 30-something New Jersey waitress who turns her life and her family's life upside down when she decides to return to college, will make its debut in the fall.</p>
        <p>At the moment, Ms. Ruggiero, who is candid, funny and self-deprecating, is temporarily moving from her big $600-a-month apartment in North Arlington (''If I had the same apartment in Manhattan I'd have to, like, hire call girls to work for me so I could afford it'') to Los Angeles. Visibly reluctant to move here, Ms. Ruggiero acknowledged that her career and life were changing  rapidly.</p>
        <p>A film script she wrote, ''Pretty the Beast,'' is to be produced by Nora Ephron. Her new television series, in which she is also a supervising producer, is starting production. And Ms. Ruggiero has ideas for several other projects that are based, more or less, on growing up in a large, tightly knit Italian family.</p>
        <p>In the series, for example, the family keeps photos of the pope and Frank Sinatra in their home. ''I grew up thinking that Frank Sinatra was actually a younger version of the pope,'' she said. ''When I made my communion we were talking about the pope and I said, 'My father has all his records,' and the nun was, like, 'What?' I actually grew up thinking that the pope sang 'Summer Wind.' '' In a quasi-serious moment, Ms. Ruggerio said that moving to Los Angeles, at least at the moment, filled her with dread. ''I'm an Italian girl from northern New Jersey,'' she said. ''The sun is kind of overbearing here. And the people! I was at the hotel bar last night and I saw like five girls who wore little dresses and had 10-foot-long legs. I don't like being the fattest person in this state.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ruggiero, who is not fat, has tried to write movies, plays and stories since she was a child. She grew up in Old Bridge, N.J., where her father, Joseph, was a maintenance worker on the New Jersey Turnpike for 30 years. (In the series,  Paul Sorvino plays the father of the young woman and works as a toll collector.) Her mother, Carol, is British. ''When her relatives come over we have peppers and eggs and tea and biscuits,'' Ms. Ruggiero said. ''My mother's kind of a white-bread Italian.''</p>
        <p>After graduating from high school, Ms. Ruggiero kept writing and worked as a waitress and bartender.  She took courses for about 10 years at several colleges, mostly at Montclair State University. (In the series, the college is called Montville.) Ms. Ruggiero said she would drop courses to earn money to pay for unexpected car insurance bills or a root canal.</p>
        <p>''At one point I was waitressing 80 hours a week and taking only photography and astronomy,'' Ms. Ruggiero said. She also worked as an Easter Bunny in a mall, made fruit baskets and was an assistant to a publicity agent in New York.</p>
        <p>She still hangs out in East Rutherford with friends at a restaurant where she once worked called Park and Orchard. While she was a waitress there, a patron, Mark St. Germain, who lived nearby, would come  by with his young daughter. He asked Ms. Ruggerio what she really wanted to do. ''I told him I was a writer, and he said that he was a writer,'' she  said. Mr. St. Germain, who has written some Off Broadway plays (''Moby Dick,'' ''Jack's Holiday'') as well as scripts for ''The Cosby Show,'' asked Ms. Ruggerio if he could read some of her work.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ruggiero gave him 10 pages of her comedy screenplay ''Pretty the Beast,'' about a suicidal writer who can't kill herself because she has writer's block and can't write the note. Mr. St. Germain told her she had talent and put her on a weekly writing regimen to complete the screenplay. After she finished it, he gave the screenplay to his agents at International Creative Management. Soon enough Ms. Ruggiero had an agent there as well as a mentor in Mr. St. Germain. (Mr. St. Germain is now writing some scripts for ''That's Life.'')</p>
        <p>Ms. Ephron, who optioned the screenplay, said, ''From the first page it was absolutely clear that Diane was an extremely funny writer with an absolutely clear voice.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ruggiero was selected to write ''That's Life'' in an unusual way. A CBS executive, Ghen Maynard, had  proposed a series that would be a twist on the premise of the hit show ''Felicity'': instead of a young woman attending college an older woman would decide to return to school.</p>
        <p>Talent agents sent more than 100 scripts to CBS, which was seeking a writer for the show. Ms. Ruggiero's film script stirred the attention of CBS; she said she would write the pilot if she could turn the heroine into an Italian-American waitress from New Jersey who decided to go to college -- just like herself. The script  for the pilot was welcomed by CBS.</p>
        <p>Anita Addison, a producer of the show and a former CBS executive who helped select Ms. Ruggiero from among more than 100 writers, said: ''This was dialogue we hadn't quite heard before. We didn't feel like it was retreaded from other television shows. It was written out of life's experiences, wonderfully irreverent.''</p>
        <p>The show stars Heather Paige Kent, a stand-up comedian and actress born in the Bronx, as Lydia, a surrogate for Ms. Ruggiero. Ellen Burstyn and Mr. Sorvino play her parents; Debi Mazar plays a smart-mouth hairstylist friend, and Peter Firth is an arrogant and sad professor. The characters are more or less based on real people or composites.</p>
        <p>The series is to be broadcast on Saturdays from 8 to 9 p.m., the time slot held for five years by ''Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,'' which drew a strong, predominantly female audience.</p>
        <p>Like the clan in the show, Ms. Ruggiero's family was not so much against her attending college as puzzled by her not wanting to settle down, marry and have children. But for all the similarities, she said, she had her antennae out for stereotypes that would be demeaning to Italian-Americans or her home state.</p>
        <p>''I had one big problem with a house we were using,'' she said. ''It was a bit unkempt out front. And I said, 'You know, these people take care of their houses.' My father is like Edward Scissorhands with the shrubbery. He has great pride.</p>
        <p>''I don't want this show to be a joke where people have names like Luigi and Cheech and it's all stereotypical and cheesy. I mean, I grew up in this area that's thick with Italian culture and I love it. And the same with New Jersey. In this hotel I was talking to this woman from Germany and she began making fun of New Jersey. And I said: 'You're from Germany! How do you make fun of New Jersey?'</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Have you ever been to New Jersey? You don't know anything. Thomas Edison's from New Jersey. How bad could it be?' ''</p>
