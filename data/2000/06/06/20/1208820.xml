        <p>Like a pilot at his controls, Stefen Fangmeier sat at the video console in a darkened meeting room at Industrial Light and Magic, a pioneer in the business of creating special effects for movies. Arrayed behind him on four rows of ratty couches and metal chairs were a dozen or so computer animators and engineers.</p>
        <p>Scenes appeared one after another on the room's oversize monitors, some just a few seconds long, others perhaps 30 seconds: huge ships lumbering through heavy seas, impossible waves washing across colossal decks, flashes of lightning, roaring torrents of wind and mist. Watching the same scenes on a satellite video hookup at the Warner Brothers lot in Burbank, the director Wolfgang Petersen and the cinematographer John Seale saw the parade of visual-effects images slide soundlessly past.</p>
        <p>''That shot, I don't know,'' Mr. Petersen said. ''It's a lot of flashing lightning in a very short time. It's too much. Maybe you can tone it down or take that second flash out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fangmeier is the visual effects supervisor on Mr. Petersen's new film, ''The Perfect Storm,'' which is to open on June 30. It is the largest and most ambitious computer-effects project Mr. Fangmeier has undertaken at Industrial Light and Magic, part of George Lucas's moviemaking empire. With its complex fluid dynamics and computer-intensive water effects, the film is even more demanding than ''Jurassic Park,'' with its digital dinosaurs, or ''Twister,'' with its virtual cyclones.</p>
        <p>Computer-generated special effects have been at the center of moviemaking for more than two decades now, especially in the kind of thunderous blockbusters that tend to dominate the summer. Even so, this is turning out to be a particularly ambitious and perhaps pivotal summer for them. Never have so many big summer movies been so centered on such effects.</p>
        <p>Ridley Scott has said that one of the chief reasons he decided to direct ''Gladiator'' was that the latest generation of sophisticated effects made it possible to recreate second-century Rome in towering and vivid detail. Disney's ''Dinosaur,'' with its groundbreaking combination of realistic, computer-generated creatures and live-action backgrounds, is a showcase for sophisticated effects.</p>
        <p>Roland Emmerich's Revolutionary War drama, ''The Patriot,'' can spread itself across a broad canvas, with flotillas of masted ships and spectacular armies of thousands, by relying technology that can transform a few hundred redcoats into a horizon-choking multitude. And Sony's Digital Human Project, an attempt to push and dissolve the boundaries of computer animation, was what made it possible for the director Paul Verhoeven to attempt, in the forthcoming ''Hollow Man,'' to bring an invisible man to the screen in a way, beg your pardon, that has never been seen before.</p>
        <p>''Using computer effects just for the sake of using them is not very interesting,'' said Mr. Emmerich. ''But where they are very useful is in helping you to make things very big, or to do things like make your skies match in shots that were filmed on different days. We could not have done 'The Patriot' the way we did it without the computers.''</p>
        <p>A growing number of filmmakers, it seems, have gone beyond big stunts and bigger explosions and have awakened to the newfound ability of computer-effects specialists to transport audiences to dazzling places, be it some vanished historical epoch or the swelling crest of a 100-foot wave.</p>
        <p>Back in the meeting room Mr. Fangmeier ran the ''Perfect Storm'' scene again, stopping and starting, the digital boat jerking back and forth in the roiling seas until the image was frozen at last on the second flash of lightning.</p>
        <p>''You mean this one?'' Mr. Fangmeier asked. Mr. Seale, sitting next to Mr. Petersen in Burbank, leaned forward and studied the screen. ''Yes, yes,'' he said, ''the one where it looks like it has legs.''</p>
        <p>The problem, Mr. Petersen and Mr. Seale said, was that the shot did not look real: it was too bright, too vivid. It would break the audience's concentration, pull them out of the movie.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fangmeier studied the shot. There were no voices of objection from the technicians and animators in the room behind him. Finally he nodded. ''Yes, we can take that out if you like,'' he said.</p>
        <p>After the viewing session Mr. Petersen said: ''The computer effects in 'Perfect Storm' were the most important thing in the telling of this story. Otherwise we never could have done it. We could never have shown what it was like to be in 100-foot seas, not in a way that would satisfy audiences in the year 2000. Who can go out and shoot in 100-foot waves? We all would have been killed. And that good old device of using water tanks and miniatures? No way. Audiences just will not buy it in the year 2000.''</p>
        <p>The enormous success, creative and financial, of ''Titanic'' in 1997 has been the prime generator for this boom in realistic effects.</p>
        <p>Those dozens of people falling off the back of the upended ocean liner -- some real actors on wires, some digital creations, crashing and tumbling together in the same shot -- brought a vividness to visual effects that filmmakers have been expanding and improving upon ever since.</p>
        <p>''What this does is, it allows you to create more spectacular images and more spectacular combinations of things,'' said Andrew Millstein, who heads Disney's Secret Lab, the studio's in-house computer animation and effects unit where ''Dinosaur'' was born. ''I think there are some filmmakers, more and more of them, who fully understand the power of the tools. Our job, in a way, is to create a new way to view reality.''</p>
        <p>The process of creating the water effects for ''The Perfect Storm'' began with John Anderson of Industrial Light and Magic, an expert in fluid dynamics, using new software that effectively builds a virtual ocean, many miles wide, inside the computer. Computer-generated ships were later added to the seas and given various weights and physical characteristics. As the animators worked with the new software and tried to make the results look realistic, they quickly realized that water behaved very differently at different points on the wave and under different circumstances.</p>
        <p>They created and named more than a dozen different kinds of water, from crest foam (the white churn at the top of a wave) to chopper wash (the pebble-in-a-pond circles created by a helicopter hovering above the water).</p>
        <p>''Every one of these behave very differently,'' said Habib Zargarpour, assistant visual effects supervisor on the film. ''You have waves that turn into foaming, blobby chunks, then into sea foam, then into mist. To me that's the most difficult thing to come up with, the look of a splash.''</p>
        <p>Many of the live-action sequences were shot in an enormous water tank on the Warner Brothers lot. The actors (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and others) were atop a re-creation of the Andrea Gail, the doomed vessel featured in the best-selling book, built on the true story on which the film is based.</p>
        <p>The boat sat on gimbals that could toss, turn and upend it while several cameras filmed the tumult from fingerlike cranes around the periphery. Thousands of gallons of water could be spilled from overhead tanks while wind machines raged and the actors were blasted across the deck.</p>
        <p>A computer in the gimbals, meanwhile, recorded every inch of the ship's movement and relayed it to the computers at Industrial Light and Magic. Visual effects technicians there could attempt to match the real ship's movement to the roster of waves they had in their virtual ocean. Then they could tweak the effect even more. Does the wave not look terrifying enough at 60 feet? O.K., make it 75.</p>
        <p>Then the visual effects shots -- there are about 336 in the film -- were shown to the director and cinematographer at the daily satellite conferences known as ''the transmission,'' at which everyone discussed whether a shot seemed to be working.</p>
        <p>''In his comments Wolfgang will often say things like, oh, this looks too computer-generated, or it looks like a model, or it doesn't somehow look real,'' Mr. Fangmeier said. ''So we go back and we fix it. It's my job to figure out how to change it to make it look real.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Petersen, the world of filmmaking has changed so much since he shot some of the water scenes in his 1981 submarine adventure, ''Das Boot,'' in a water tank with miniatures.</p>
        <p>''The progress they have made in generating totally believable environments and people, it's all so vastly improved,'' he said. ''I have no idea how they do it. It's a mystery to me. In this film some of the shots are of actors on the set, and some are of computer-generated actors on a computer-generated ship. Sometimes I look at a shot, and I have to ask them, is this something we shot, or is this you?''</p>
        <p>All of which has spurred him creatively, Mr. Petersen said, forcing him to enlarge his ambitions and rethink his vision for this film and for films he hopes to make in the future.</p>
        <p>''If you feed the computer, it's basically limitless what you can do nowadays,'' Mr. Petersen said. ''You can create worlds. You can do whatever you want.''</p>
