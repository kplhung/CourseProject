        <p>Complaining that corporate sponsorship is turning presidential debates into beer commercials, Ralph Nader and others filed a suit today against the Federal Election Commission over how the debates are financed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nader, the Green Party presidential candidate, filed the suit in Federal District Court here along with such celebrity plaintiffs as Susan Sarandon and Phil Donahue.</p>
        <p>The suit, which the plaintiffs say could affect this fall's presidential debates, says that corporate financing of the debates amounts to an illegal corporate campaign contribution. It asks the court to strike down the F.E.C. regulations that allow corporations -- like Anheuser-Busch, the maker of Budweiser and a sponsor of this fall's debates -- to contribute millions of dollars to the staging of the debates.</p>
        <p>''It's turning our presidential debates into a beer commercial,'' Mr. Nader said in a telephone interview. ''And these companies are really sponsoring an exclusive to our campaign commercial for Bush and Gore.''</p>
        <p>Since 1907, almost all corporate financing of campaigns has been banned; only a few small exceptions are allowed, like money for general get-out-the-vote efforts. But the Federal Election Commission's rules specify that if presidential debates establish objective criteria for selecting candidates who take part, then they can receive corporate financing without it being considered a campaign contribution.</p>
        <p>That is wrong, said John C. Bonifaz, executive director of the National Voting Rights Institute, a nonprofit group specializing in campaign finance litigation.</p>
        <p>Giving money to the debates ''is, in our view,'' Mr. Bonifaz said, ''a means by which major corporations curry favor with the major parties in a way that completely undermines the very spirit and essence of the prohibition on corporate contributions.''</p>
        <p>Scott Lewis of the Boston law firm Palmer &amp; Dodge, which is handling the suit together with the National Voting Rights Institute, also used the beer commercial analogy, saying: ''The debates this fall look like the Bud Bowl. Federal law requires an overhaul of this process.''</p>
        <p>Such complaints are not new to the Commission on Presidential Debates, which was set up in 1987. At least two other challenges to the debates are under way this year, said Janet H. Brown, the commission's executive director. A similar challenge has also been raised by the Libertarian Party in New York State.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brown declined to comment on the election law that allows the corporate financing. But, she said, ''I can say that the commission's donors do not have, and never have had, any input on any substantive decisions that we have made, whether it's regarding the number, schedule and format of the debates, who is invited to debate or any other substantive piece of our work.''</p>
        <p>The commission has set three criteria this year for who can debate, she said: the candidate must be constitutionally eligible for the presidency (that is, old enough and native born), must be on enough state ballots to have a chance at securing enough votes in the electoral college to win and must be garnering at least 15 percent in national polls. Recent national polls show support for Mr. Nader at 4 percent to 6 percent, although a recent survey put his support in California at 10 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nader said that if the court ruled against him but he earned enough support to take part in the debate he would participate. But, he said, ''one of the first things I would say is that these debates should never be funded by corporate money in the future.''</p>
        <p>The debates are scheduled for Boston on Oct. 3, then Winston-Salem, N.C., and St. Louis. Ms. Brown declined to comment on the suit's chances of derailing the debates. She said only, ''The plans we have under way are the result of already more than two years' worth of work, and I hope very much they will stay on track.''</p>
