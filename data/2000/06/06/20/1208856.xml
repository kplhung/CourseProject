        <p>This week, 25 years after unifying under Communism, Vietnam is testing the systems that will run the country's first stock market. The opening bell may ring next month.

        <p>''Seeing will be believing,'' said J. Mark Mobius, a prominent money manager who started a Vietnam fund in 1994 for Templeton Asset Management Ltd., believing that the country would embrace free-market changes and make good on plans to open a stock market.</p>

        <p>This week, 25 years after unifying under Communism, Vietnam is testing the systems that will run the country's first stock market. The opening bell may ring next month. But like Vietnam's tentative experiments in recent years with ''market socialism,'' the tests are getting mixed results and reviews.</p>
        <p>''Seeing will be believing,'' said J. Mark Mobius, a prominent money manager who started a Vietnam fund in 1994 for Templeton Asset Management Ltd., believing that the country would embrace free-market changes and make good on plans to open a stock market.</p>
        <p>Vietnamese officials will not say exactly when the market will open, though reports in government-controlled media have suggested a July start. In 1996, the government established a State Securities Commission to create a stock market. But bureaucracy and corruption have hindered efforts to lure foreign investment and privatize state-owned enterprises.</p>
        <p>There were some early indications today that the Ho Chi Minh City Securities Trading Center was getting off to a rocky start, despite assistance from the Stock Exchange of Thailand. Mock trading scheduled for today was reportedly thwarted by a power failure that crippled the electronic trading board.</p>
        <p>Even if the board worked, it would report the stock prices of just two companies -- the Refrigeration Electrical Engineering Corporation and the Cables and Telecommunication Materials Joint Stock Company. They are the only companies that have registered for a listing.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Mobius's Vietnam fund, it withdrew from most Vietnam investments in 1998 and broadened its focus to Southeast Asia. Mr. Mobius said he remained unconvinced that Hanoi's Communist leaders could allow a free market to flourish in the former Saigon. ''Put it this way,'' he said. ''I'm not getting on the first plane to Vietnam. I've been theredone that.''</p>
