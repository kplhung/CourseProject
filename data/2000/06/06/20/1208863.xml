        <p>The Supreme Court today unanimously struck down a Massachusetts law aimed at boycotting companies that do business in Myanmar, ruling that crucial differences between the state law and existing federal sanctions ''compromise the very capacity of the president to speak for the nation with one voice in dealing with other governments.''</p>
        <p>Making a rare excursion into the realm of foreign policy, the court said that under the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, which gives Congress the power to pre-empt state laws, the Massachusetts law intended to undermine the government of Myanmar, formerly Burma, had to fall because it ''stands in the way of Congress's diplomatic objectives.''</p>

        <p>The Supreme Court today unanimously struck down a Massachusetts law aimed at boycotting companies that do business in Myanmar, ruling that crucial differences between the state law and existing federal sanctions ''compromise the very capacity of the president to speak for the nation with one voice in dealing with other governments.''</p>
        <p>Making a rare excursion into the realm of foreign policy, the court said that under the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, which gives Congress the power to pre-empt state laws, the Massachusetts law intended to undermine the government of Myanmar, formerly Burma, had to fall because it ''stands in the way of Congress's diplomatic objectives.''</p>
        <p>The court stopped well short of declaring that states have no constitutionally valid means of taking positions with foreign policy implications, as many did during years of protest against the apartheid government in South Africa.</p>
        <p>Rather, Justice David H. Souter's opinion focused tightly on the ways in which the Massachusetts law, which was adopted in early 1996, was irreconcilable with a federal law passed by Congress three months later and carried out by a presidential executive order in May 1997.</p>
        <p>Justice Souter wrote that while the hallmark of the federal policy was a ''calibration of force'' -- leaving the president great flexibility to impose or lift sanctions as a form of diplomatic leverage -- the Massachusetts law was much more categorical in barring state agencies from doing business in most circumstances with any company that conducted business in Myanmar.</p>
        <p>''We see the state Burma law as an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congress's full objectives under the federal act,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>The ruling left proponents of cutting off trade with the Asian country's repressive military government with several other approaches, including seeking divestment by public pension funds of the stock of companies that do business there.</p>
        <p>Robert Stumberg, a law professor at Georgetown University who has provided legal advice to ''free Burma'' coalitions around the country, said today that along with divestment, other options included seeking public disclosure of corporate activities in Myanmar as well as pushing for new legislation from Congress that would disavow any desire to pre-empt state and local efforts.</p>
        <p>There is considerable sympathy in Congress for state and local anti-Myanmar efforts. Mr. Stumberg filed a brief for 78 members of Congress who said they had not intended to pre-empt local laws.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration argued strongly that beyond its specific provisions, the Massachusetts law was unconstitutional as an incursion into the federal government's exclusive foreign policy role.</p>
        <p>It was on that broad ground that the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit struck down the state law last year. The court today did not go so far, limiting its analysis to the specific ways in which the state law conflicted with ''Congress's specific delegation to the president of flexible discretion.''</p>
        <p>As a result, Professor Peter Spiro of Hofstra Law School said, ''once you get outside the Burma context, this decision is of limited utility in trying to bat back state and local efforts to make foreign policy.''</p>
        <p>Several cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, have adopted similar measures restricting municipal purchases from companies that do business in Burma. Vermont is the only other state with such a law.</p>
        <p>Other countries, including Indonesia, Nigeria and Switzerland, have recently been the targets of selective-purchasing legislation, most of which have not passed. But Miami's embargo against Cuba, which is stricter than the federal embargo, is almost certainly unconstitutional under today's ruling, said Professor Pamela S. Falk of the City University of New York law school.</p>
        <p>The court today took note of the state and local sanctions against South Africa that were widespread during the 1980's. No challenge to those laws ever reached the court, so there was no particular lesson to draw from that recent history, Justice Souter said. Professor Spiro said that many of the South Africa sanctions ''would have had a tough time surviving'' today's opinion.</p>
        <p>The case drew intense interest overseas. The European Union and its 15 member states filed a brief asking the justices to find the law unconstitutional. It also became a lightning rod for anti-globalization sentiment; protesters demonstrated outside the court the day of arguments, carrying such signs as ''Boston Tea Party 2000'' and ''E.U. out of Boston Harbor.''</p>
        <p>The case, Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, No. 99-474, was brought in 1998 against the Massachusetts law by a Washington-based trade organization of 550 companies that engage in foreign commerce.</p>
        <p>Thirty-four of the National Foreign Trade Council's members were on the state's restricted-purchase list of companies that did business in Myanmar. The council won a permanent injunction against the law's enforcement from the Federal District Court in Boston, in a decision that the appeals court affirmed. (When the case first reached the Supreme Court, it was known as Natsios v. National Foreign Trade Council.)</p>
