        <p>Bad News for Pests</p>
        <p>A water droplet hitting the waxy top of a leaf is like a basketball hitting a backboard -- it rebounds off the surface. This can be a problem if, for example, the water is a pesticide solution being applied to crops. Studies have shown that in much pesticide spraying, less than half of the spray is retained by the plants.</p>
        <p>But scientists in France, researching how droplets rebound from such a hydrophobic surface, have discovered a way to help make them stick. The key, they report in the journal Nature, is to add small amounts of a polymer to the solution.</p>
        <p>The scientists studied droplet impact using a video system that recorded 1,000 frames per second. A plain water droplet hits, spreads out to a maximum diameter and then contracts so much and so quickly that it leaves the surface. A droplet containing polyethyleneoxide or another polymer, on the other hand, contracts very little and stays where it hits. The researchers found that the elongational viscosity of the polymer -- that is, how it resists stretching -- dampens the contraction of the droplet.</p>
        <p>The researchers say their findings could be useful not only in agricultural spraying but in industrial and consumer applications where cutting waste or preventing the spread of contaminants is desired. They note that so little polymer is needed that other characteristics of the solution are essentially unchanged, meaning that other processes that it has to go through -- pumping, for example -- would not be affected.</p>
        <p>Ice Age Survivor</p>
        <p>The Irish elk was a spectacular animal, the largest deer that ever lived, with antlers that spanned up to 12 feet. Like some other large mammals, it was thought to have become extinct at the end of the last ice age, about 10,600 years ago.</p>
        <p>Reports of its demise, however, have been found to be a bit premature. Radiocarbon dating by British researchers of a specimen unearthed two centuries ago on the Isle of Man shows that it is only about 9,225 years old. Thus the Irish elk joins some other large mammals, including the woolly mammoth, as an unexpected survivor into the Holocene, the modern post-ice age epoch.</p>
        <p>The researchers, reporting in Nature, found that the body size of the specimen was well below the mean for the species, indicating that the same factors thought to have killed off the animal during the ice age -- notably a lack of food -- probably contributed to decreasing body size.</p>
        <p>The Isle of Man became separated from mainland Britain about 10,000 years ago. So the finding shows that some large mammals were able to survive the ice in isolated spots, only to die off later, unable to cope with changes in vegetation, perhaps, or the victims of human or other predators.</p>
        <p>A Modern Survivor</p>
        <p>Conservationists who had been concerned that California sea otters might be going the way of the Irish elk got some good news this month with the release of spring survey numbers that show that the otter population increased by almost 11 percent from the year before, to more than 2,300.</p>
        <p>The population has been on a roller-coaster ride in recent decades, declining in the mid-1970's, picking up again after restrictions on some fishing nets were instituted and then declining again. While otter experts said the current increase, the first since 1995, was an encouraging sign, they added that the increases would have to continue for several years before they would declare that the declines have stopped. Particularly encouraging in the current survey was the fact that the number of otter pups increased by almost 14 percent.</p>
        <p>The surveys are done twice a year, in May and November. Spotters cover about 375 miles of the central California coast.</p>
        <p>Disease, pollution, loss of food sources and entanglement in fishing gear are all considered causes of the decline of the animals, which were listed as a threatened species in 1977.</p>
