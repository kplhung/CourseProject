        <p>To listen to the manufacturers of an ever-growing list of germ-fighting products -- including antibacterial soaps and sprays, toothbrushes and toothpastes, pajamas and slippers, sheets and mattresses, potty chairs, high chairs, toys, sponges, cutting boards and even chopsticks and paper towels -- my family and I should have been riddled with disease all these many years.</p>
        <p>My husband is allergic to antibacterial soaps, so we abandoned them 34 years ago. I do not have a dishwasher, so our dishes, glasses and utensils are not ''sterilized'' at high temperatures. I had no clothes dryer for 20 years and still don't use one for drying and ''sterilizing'' our clothes. We use sponges to wipe the kitchen counters and cloth towels to dry our hands. We ride the subways, often holding the poles that the ads tell us are crawling with billions of germs. And we do not use instant ''hand sanitizer.''</p>

        <p>To listen to the manufacturers of an ever-growing list of germ-fighting products -- including antibacterial soaps and sprays, toothbrushes and toothpastes, pajamas and slippers, sheets and mattresses, potty chairs, high chairs, toys, sponges, cutting boards and even chopsticks and paper towels -- my family and I should have been riddled with disease all these many years.</p>
        <p>My husband is allergic to antibacterial soaps, so we abandoned them 34 years ago. I do not have a dishwasher, so our dishes, glasses and utensils are not ''sterilized'' at high temperatures. I had no clothes dryer for 20 years and still don't use one for drying and ''sterilizing'' our clothes. We use sponges to wipe the kitchen counters and cloth towels to dry our hands. We ride the subways, often holding the poles that the ads tell us are crawling with billions of germs. And we do not use instant ''hand sanitizer.''</p>
        <p>As infants, our sons crawled around the streets and parks of New York, putting whatever they happened to find into their mouths, which is how babies test their interest in all manner of objects.</p>
        <p>Yet, to my knowledge, none of us has ever acquired an ''environmental'' infection or even spread microorganisms from one person to another. In fact, we have been remarkably healthy for more than three decades, despite what the manufacturers tell us: that everything from our hands to our counters to our supposedly clean laundry is crawling with potentially pathogenic bacteria that their products can wipe out.</p>
        <p>But can they? And if they can, at what price does this superhygienic environment come? People frightened by a microbial world that harbors superbugs they believe are out to get them may be adopting an approach that actually fosters rather than suppresses serious infections.</p>
        <p>Resistant Organisms</p>
        <p>Earlier this month at a conference sponsored by the American Medical Association, Dr. Stuart B. Levy, director of the Center for Adaptation Genetics and Drug Resistance at Tufts University in Boston, voiced serious concerns about the more than 700 antibacterial products now crowding the marketplace. They do not, he said, kill all bacteria, only those that are most susceptible. They upset the natural balance of microorganisms and they leave behind the bacteria that are strong enough to survive and multiply. Furthermore, these surviving bacteria may evolve resistance to both antimicrobials and antibiotics that could be transferred to dangerous pathogens.</p>
        <p>Last week, because of the growing concern about the emergence of antibiotic-resistant germs, the American Medical Association urged the government to step up regulation of antibacterial soaps, lotions and other household products.</p>
        <p>Explaining the process two years ago in Scientific American, Dr. Levy wrote: ''Bacteria are a natural, and needed, part of life. Most live blamelessly. In fact, they often protect us from disease because they compete with, and thus limit the proliferation of, pathogenic bacteria. The benign competitors can be important allies in the fight against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.''</p>
        <p>In making a case against products spiked with antibacterials, he explained: ''Like antibiotics, antibacterials can alter the mix of bacteria; they simultaneously kill susceptible bacteria and promote the growth of resistant strains. These resistant microbes may include bacteria that were present from the start. But they can also include ones that were unable to gain a foothold previously and are now able to thrive thanks to the destruction of competing microbes.''</p>
        <p>Given the chance to proliferate, some of these emergent organisms ''may become new agents of disease,'' Dr. Levy said.</p>
        <p>The most frequently used antibacterial agent in consumer products is triclosan. Laura McMurry and colleagues in Dr. Levy's laboratory have shown that while triclosan wipes out the most sensitive bacteria, it also gives rise to bacteria that resist its action by pumping the chemical out of their cells.</p>
        <p>''Residues are the potential problem,'' Dr. Levy said. ''We're talking about chemicals that can stick around in the home and continue to select for resistance when the levels of these chemicals drop. Then even high levels of the chemicals won't work.''</p>
        <p>Another potential problem of creating a superhygienic environment is misdevelopment of the immune system in children that persists throughout life. The developing immune system may need to be primed to function properly.</p>
        <p>During their first year of life, babies need to be exposed to germs to foster the production of T-helper 1 cells, which make antibodies to dangerous microorganisms. If the baby's environment is too clean, the production of T-helper 1 cells is not adequately stimulated and the immune system instead overproduces T-helper 2 cells, which create antibodies to allergens and could result in lifelong allergies or asthma, a recent study in Italy showed.</p>
        <p>Practicing Proper Hygiene</p>
        <p>There is no need for an ordinary healthy person to be a fanatic about cleanliness, Dr. Levy said. Among the hygienic habits that make sense are these:</p>
        <p>*Always wash your hands with soap and water after using the toilet, before preparing or eating food, after working in the garden or changing a dirty diaper.</p>
        <p>*Thoroughly rinse under running water all fruits and vegetables before eating or preparing them, including foods like melons and grapefruit. Skins can harbor disease-causing microorganisms that contaminate the edible part of the food, especially if it sits around unrefrigerated for a while.</p>
        <p>*Always thaw foods in the refrigerator.  Do not leave cooked foods unrefrigerated for more than two hours, or for more than one hour when the temperature reaches 90.</p>
        <p>*Use separate cutting boards for uncooked meat, poultry or fish, and for vegetables, fruits and bread. Always wash surfaces, including the sink, and utensils that have been in contact with raw meat, poultry, fish or eggs with hot soapy water as soon as you are through using them.</p>
        <p>*Plastic cutting boards, sponges and dishcloths can be sanitized in the dishwasher.</p>
        <p>*To sanitize a surface or object, use bleach, denatured alcohol or hydrogen peroxide. These do their work and disappear, leaving no residue to foster microbial resistance. Laundry detergent with bleach is fine.</p>
        <p>*Infant clothing, bedding, etc. might be washed separately from adult laundry, but no special detergent is needed. If you use cloth diapers, they should always be washed separately in hot water with bleach.</p>
        <p>*Close the lid on the toilet before you flush it to keep tiny droplets containing microorganisms from spewing into the air.</p>
        <p>The rules change if someone in the household is seriously ill or has a compromised immune system. ''Products containing antibacterial agents are best reserved for use when someone is very sick,'' Dr. Levy said. ''When caring for a sick person, hand washing should should take more than one minute.''</p>
