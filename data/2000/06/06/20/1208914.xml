        <p>Although he arrived in New York with a solid reputation as a skilled administrator, Archbishop Edward M. Egan showed yesterday that he saw his new role as being a teacher to his vast flock, too, fulfilling an essential role of a priest.</p>
        <p>''We are a people of prayer,'' the archbishop said in a homily at his service of installation at St. Patrick's Cathedral, attended by more than 1,000 priests and 100 bishops. ''We are a people of justice. We are a people of charity.'' His message laid out what he considered to be foundational elements of Roman Catholic identity.</p>
        <p>In describing what he meant by justice and charity, Archbishop Egan urged New York's Catholics to stand against racial and religious discrimination, to care for the poor and to oppose abortion and euthanasia. The victims of discrimination, the impoverished, ''the unborn'' and the elderly, he said, are all ''images of God.''</p>
        <p>Being a teacher means working directly to shape the spiritual understanding of the faithful by clearly expounding church doctrine. As an expert on canon law who spent 18 years in the Vatican, Archbishop Egan is well qualified to take on that role. And in carving out what he sees as his responsibilities, the archbishop signaled that he would be the one who defined how he filled the job as the archdiocese's leader, not those who have described him as a man whose greatest talents and interests lie in management and fund-raising.</p>
        <p>But then, he has stepped into a job so multifaceted and demanding it has never been possible to say it is just about one set of duties. On an administrative level, New York's archbishop oversees a vast network of schools, parishes and hospitals.</p>
        <p>He also speaks from a national pulpit, amplified by intense news media attention, from which he can proclaim the views of the church on a wide variety of social, moral and economic issues. And an archbishop in New York can play a leading role in fostering good relations between Catholics and other religious groups. Both of these tasks were widely acknowledged as particular strengths of Archbishop Egan's predecessor, Cardinal John J. O'Connor.</p>
        <p>But New York's archbishop must be conscious of the needs of his polyglot flock, a constituency that grew by one-third in the last 15 years to 2.4 million people. Even in a ceremony attended by bishops from around the nation and representatives of other faiths, Archbishop Egan spoke primarily to New York's Catholics yesterday, calling them to prayer and to a clear understanding of church teaching about the Mass and its central place in Catholic life.</p>
        <p>In his homily, he cited a national poll, taken several years ago, that showed that many Catholics were uncertain of a basic teaching, that the bread and the wine at the Mass are changed into the body and blood of Christ. On this belief, he said, there can be ''no compromise.''</p>
        <p>(Although the archbishop did not name the poll he was describing, a New York Times/CBS News poll in April 1994 found that more than 60 percent of American Catholics said ''the bread and wine are symbolic reminders of Christ.'')</p>
        <p>Interestingly, Archbishop Egan began his homily with a bricks-and-mortar analogy, talking about the basilica in Rome where he was consecrated a bishop in 1985. But his point, in speaking about how that church rested on the foundations of a Christian building dating to Roman times, was to describe how a strong identity among New York's Catholics -- involving prayer, worship and adherence to the church's teachings -- would make a strong foundation for the archdiocese. In terms of his preaching style, the archbishop's use of personal experience to introduce a broader message resembled the way he structured his homily at St. Patrick's on Sunday, during the ceremony in which he was officially invested as New York's ninth archbishop.</p>
        <p>In that message, which dealt at length with the inspirational power of Christian charity, he spoke of how the care showed by nuns toward an injured person who staggered into a church service in the South Bronx had so moved one man who saw it that he later became a priest, ordained by Archbishop Egan when he was bishop of Bridgeport, Conn.</p>
        <p>The incident, the archbishop said, occurred while he was an auxiliary bishop in New York in the mid-1980's.</p>
        <p>In that homily, too, Archbishop Egan struck a theme similar to his theme yesterday, saying he saw his coming to New York as joining a community that ''heroically defends the child in the womb, the elderly in the nursing home, the sick and the disabled.'' That community, he said, would see ''every human being as an image of divinity.''</p>
