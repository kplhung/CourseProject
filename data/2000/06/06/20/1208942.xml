        <p>One of the biggest financial services companies in South Africa, Old Mutual P.L.C., reached an agreement to acquire the United Asset Management Corporation, a Boston-based fund manager, in a deal valued at nearly $1.5 billion. Old Mutual, which is based in London, will pay $25 a share for United Asset Management, which has $188 billion under management and caters to institutions, mutual funds and affluent private investors. Last month, Old Mutual completed its purchase of the Gerrard Group, a British fund management and specialty banking company, and the company says it still is in the market for more assets.</p>
