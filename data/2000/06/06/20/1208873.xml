        <p>British customs officers searching a consignment of tomatoes aboard a Dutch truck in the port city of Dover found the bodies of 58 Asian men and women. It was suspected that the victims -- presumed to be poor migrants being smuggled into Britain -- had died of suffocation.</p>
        <p>The driver of the truck was arrested, and a police investigation was under way. Two men survived and were taken to the hospital. Officials said at least 20 criminal groups were actively involved in bringing illegal immigrants into Britain and forcing them into farm or service jobs at low wages. Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke of the need to stamp out this ''evil trade in people.''</p>
