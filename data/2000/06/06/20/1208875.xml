        <p>Joseph V. Coccimiglio, an award-winning casino and leisure industry stock analyst for Prudential Securities, announced yesterday that he was gay in an e-mail to clients that created a minor stir on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>In the e-mail, Mr. Coccimiglio said that he was inspired to make the announcement because June is gay pride month and he had seen Allan Gilmour, a Prudential board member and a former vice chairman of the Ford Motor Company, discuss his homosexuality at a gay pride rally. Until now, ''I've lacked the courage to be proud of who I am,'' he wrote.</p>

        <p>Joseph V. Coccimiglio, an award-winning casino and leisure industry stock analyst for Prudential Securities, announced yesterday that he was gay in an e-mail to clients that created a minor stir on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>In the e-mail, Mr. Coccimiglio said that he was inspired to make the announcement because June is gay pride month and he had seen Allan Gilmour, a Prudential board member and a former vice chairman of the Ford Motor Company, discuss his homosexuality at a gay pride rally. Until now, ''I've lacked the courage to be proud of who I am,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>On Wall Street, a generally conservative place where few top managers or analysts are openly gay, Mr. Coccimiglio's announcement came as a surprise. By late afternoon, Mr. Coccimiglio said he had received more than 40 e-mails and 20 telephone calls from clients, which were mostly supportive, asking about his note.</p>
        <p>''The fact that it's created such a stir shows how much progress needs to be made,'' Mr. Coccimiglio said. ''I've been on Wall Street for eight years, and I've never dealt with anybody in management who is openly gay, or any senior analysts. It's about time for people to become aware that there are successful people on Wall Street that are gay.''</p>
