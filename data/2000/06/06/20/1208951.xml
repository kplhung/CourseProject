        <p>H&amp;R Block in Kansas City, Mo., said yesterday that it had named Campbell Mithun Esty in Minneapolis, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, to handle creative duties for its worldwide account, with billings estimated at $100 million. That assignment had been handled since 1996 by the Chicago office of Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising, which decided against taking part in a review that began in late March.</p>
        <p>The review, managed by Select Resources International in Los Angeles, had been narrowed to Campbell Mithun and the Chicago office of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. A third finalist, Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, also owned by Interpublic, withdrew last week. Three agencies were eliminated from the review last month: Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners in New York, also part of Interpublic; Publicis in New York, part of Publicis S.A.; and the Richards Group in Dallas.</p>
