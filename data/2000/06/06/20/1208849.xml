        <p>Five Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee, the panel responsible for Medicare legislation, plan to introduce a bill on Tuesday to establish prescription drug benefits for the elderly, even as senior Senate Republicans appear to be floundering in efforts to develop a proposal of their own.</p>
        <p>The Democrats' initiative, orchestrated by Senator Bob Graham of Florida, comes just a day before the House Ways and Means Committee is to start voting on legislation to authorize outpatient drug benefits under Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled.</p>
        <p>Senator Graham said he hoped his proposal would be ''the basis for a bipartisan compromise,'' and he added, ''The chances are at least 50-50 that something will happen on this issue this year.''</p>
        <p>Congress has already set aside $40 billion over five years for drug benefits.</p>
        <p>The new bill is supported by 5 of the 9 Democrats on the 20-member Finance Committee -- Mr. Graham, Max Baucus of Montana, Richard H. Bryan of Nevada, Kent Conrad of North Dakota and Charles S. Robb of Virginia -- and by one Republican, Senator Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, who is not on the panel.</p>
        <p>Under the proposal, Mr. Graham said, drug insurance premiums for most Medicare beneficiaries would be $35 to $40 a month, the same as under a bill introduced last week by House Republicans. People with high incomes would pay higher premiums.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Graham's bill, the beneficiary would have to pay the first $250 a year in prescription drug expenses. The government would share costs beyond that amount, paying a larger proportion as drug expenses increased.</p>
        <p>The government would pay 50 percent of drug expenses from $250 to $3,500, and the beneficiary would pay the rest. The government would pay 75 percent of costs from $3,500 to $4,000 a year, and it would pay all costs over $4,000 a year.</p>
        <p>This is significantly different from the proposal offered by House Republicans, which has a gap in coverage: Medicare would pay half of drug costs from $250 to $2,100, but the patient would then be solely responsible for several thousand dollars of drug costs, and the insurer would not step in again until the beneficiary had incurred $6,000 of costs.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Graham's bill, the protection against very high drug costs, known as catastrophic coverage, would begin in 2003, along with basic drug benefits. By contrast, under President Clinton's plan, basic drug benefits would begin in 2003, with catastrophic coverage to follow three years later.</p>
        <p>The chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, began meeting with committee members last week to seek common ground, but members of both parties said the sessions had been unproductive. Mr. Roth and other Senate Republican leaders have not publicly offered any detailed proposals for Medicare drug benefits.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Graham's bill, the government would charge higher premiums to people with incomes of more than $75,000 a year and families with incomes exceeding $150,000 a year. The government subsidy would be gradually reduced as incomes rose. The maximum premium, 50 percent above the basic premium, would be charged to people with annual incomes exceeding $100,000 for an individual or $200,000 for a couple.</p>
