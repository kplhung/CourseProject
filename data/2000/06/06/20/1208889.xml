        <p>The New York Times is expected to sign an agreement this week with state and city officials to build a 40-story headquarters on Eighth Avenue, between 40th and 41st Streets, according to executives involved in the talks.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, The Times would pay nearly $100 million for the development rights to the site, the executives said. The city, in turn, is expected to provide a series of tax breaks.</p>
        <p>The proposed tower would sit within the borders of the Times Square redevelopment project and across Eighth Avenue from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. It would be the third home for the newspaper in the Times Square area in 100 years and would allow The Times to consolidate operations now scattered among six buildings.</p>
        <p>''We're in discussions with the city and state,'' said Catherine Mathis, a spokeswoman for The Times. ''But there are many things that have not been finalized.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mathis would not comment on ''any monetary terms of any potential arrangement.''</p>
        <p>The agreement, or memorandum of understanding, serves as an outline for the headquarters project and sets the stage for what will probably be months of lease negotiations over the final terms of a deal with the state and the city. Talks on the project began last fall.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, The Times selected Forest City Ratner Companies as a developer and partner for the project. Under their agreement, The Times would take up to 900,000 square feet in the tower, out of a total of 1.37 million square feet, while the developer would take the rest of the space. There would be retail stores on the ground level.</p>
        <p>The state would have to condemn the property and demolish about eight low-rise buildings now on the site before construction could begin.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the newspaper's 87-year-old headquarters, on 43rd Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, would be sold and presumably razed for a new building, according to real estate executives and government officials.</p>
        <p>The Times is in the process of winnowing a list of potential architects to four from eight. Candidates included Sir Norman Foster, the British architect, and Cesar Pelli, who designed the tallest buildings in the world, Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. To encourage diversity of architecture in the area, state and city officials had asked the newspaper to exclude Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill; Fox &amp; Fowle and other architects who had designed Times Square buildings in recent years. The Times considered a number of European architects, including several who have never worked on office projects. The four finalists are to submit designs in competition for the commission.</p>
        <p>The state's guidelines for the building require a symmetrical mid-block tower set back from Eighth Avenue atop a large base of six to eight floors, for the newspaper's newsroom, according to an architect who has seen preliminary plans.</p>
        <p>The Times is resisting the state's demand that there be large illuminated signs on the side of the building facing Eighth Avenue, much as there are on buildings in Times Square, executives involved in the discussions said. The state is also requiring that the project embrace some kind of public amenity, like a subway entrance.</p>
