        <p>Shaquille O'Neal spent much of the last four years trying to meet high expectations, and deal with heartache and the perception that he and Kobe Bryant were simply too young and immature to seize a championship. Hurdle after hurdle, their Los Angeles Lakers team leapt over everyone this season -- until only Reggie Miller and the resilient Indiana Pacers remained.</p>
        <p>Tonight, before a screaming crowd at the Staples Center, the Lakers cleared the final barrier.</p>
        <p>With Coach Phil Jackson folding his arms in serene contentment, having won his seventh title in the last nine seasons, the Lakers won their first National Basketball Association championship under his guidance.</p>
        <p>Delivering down the stretch, coming from behind for three quarters, O'Neal, Bryant and Los Angeles finally caught the Pacers, winning by 116-111 in Game 6 and securing the franchise's first title of the post-Magic Johnson era.</p>
        <p>O'Neal, 28, completed a majestic triple-crown season -- he had won the scoring title and the league's most valuable player award -- by scoring 41 points and grabbing 12 rebounds, and being named M.V.P. of the finals.</p>
        <p>Few shots were bigger than the running floater he made on the right side with just over nine minutes remaining. Hit by Derrick McKey and Austin Croshere, O'Neal somehow converted the layup that gave the Lakers their first lead since the last second of the first quarter.</p>
        <p>When Rick Fox put in a soft 3-pointer from the left wing with less than nine minutes left to give the Lakers a 4-point lead, they had scored on nine straight possessions.</p>
        <p>After the championship was secure, O'Neal was overcome by the moment. Holding his hands high, both index fingers pointed toward the sky, O'Neal caught Bryant, who leapt into his arms moments after the game ended. He began crying as he made his way around the court, hugging teammates, kissing and embracing his mother, Lucille Harrison.</p>
        <p>Choked up on the podium, O'Neal accepted his M.V.P. award for the series, having averaged 38 points and 21 rebounds.</p>
        <p>''I've been in the league eight years, and this is the moment you wait for,'' he said. ''Growing up, watching Larry and Magic and Michael celebrating, to see Hakeem and Robert Horry celebrating in 1995 with Orlando, I wanted my moment.</p>
        <p>He added: ''I've held my emotions in for 11 years, 3 years in college and 8 in the pros. I've always wanted to win. It just came out. It just came out.''</p>
        <p>The party did not begin until Bryant hit four free throws in the final 13 seconds. The Pacers almost came back from a 7-point deficit twice in the final minutes.</p>
        <p>Miller, who finished with 25 points, took a wild 30-footer with 30 seconds left that did not come close. ''Probably if I drove and got to the free-throw line, I could have made it easier,'' he said. ''But I never want to do things easy. I wanted to tie the ballgame up right there.''</p>
        <p>Bryant, who ended with 26 points, 10 rebounds and 4 assists, dropped in a 22-footer from the right wing with 3 minutes 28 seconds remaining that gave the Lakers a 109-103 lead.</p>
        <p>O'Neal was a lethal weapon in the fourth quarter, too. Hitting a pretty turnaround from the left baseline about 15 feet away and dunking missed put-backs, he brought the fans to their feet and the Pacers to their knees.</p>
        <p>The Lakers won the series, four games to two, and won all three games at their home arena.</p>
        <p>''He was just too much for us,'' said Larry Bird, who coached his last game with the Pacers after a three-year run. ''Shaq was awesome the whole series. He's the most dominating player in our league. He's powerful, strong, able to get the ball in the hole.''</p>
        <p>Jalen Rose led the Pacers with 29 points, including a 3-pointer that tied the score with 5:08 remaining.</p>
        <p>Horry, Ron Harper and the stingy Lakers defense also played an important role in the Lakers' first title since 1988, hitting key shots and stifling Indiana in the final minutes.</p>
        <p>The Pacers were trying to become the seventh team in N.B.A. history to recover from a 3-1 deficit in a seven-game series and the first team to accomplish the feat in the finals.</p>
        <p>For more than three quarters, they looked determined to force a Game 7. Moving the ball around the perimeter, getting clutch shooting from Miller and Rose and inspired play off the bench from Croshere and Sam Perkins, Indiana was in command.</p>
        <p>But somehow the Lakers found the missing element from their fairy-tale season, the one thing they needed to erase the perception that they lacked a killer instinct: the hammer, a fourth-quarter performance so dominating that nothing could be left to chance in a deciding game on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>They found it, and that is why the streamers and confetti descended from the rafters, the embroidered championship hats and T-shirts were distributed, and O'Neal, having scored more than 40 points in three of the six games, grinned wide and proud and hugged Bryant, his 21-year-old teammate, as the buzzer sounded and the celebration began.</p>
        <p>Bryant said he had a dream the other night that the Lakers had won a championship. ''It came true tonight,'' he said. ''We worked so hard. We finally got our championship.''</p>
        <p>After he was finished celebrating with teammates, O'Neal rushed to the sidelines to greet the frenzied fans, who tried to pat his bald head. When the trophy presentation began, he said, ''I just want to thank you for believing in us.''</p>
        <p>O'Neal and Bryant finally believed in themselves and saw their championship dream in living color.</p>
