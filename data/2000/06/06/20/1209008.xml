        <p>SILBERMINTZ-Seymour. K'hal Adath Jeshurun mourns the passing of our Choir's Musical Director. For nearly 40 years his enormous talent, immense patience with amateurs and his ready smile, coupled with an abundance of grace and humility, endeared him to three generations of choir members and concertgoers. The notation ''Arr. SS'' on so much of our music leaves an indelible mark on the liturgy of our Shul. May the Almighty comfort his wife Elaine, their daughters and his brother Teddy amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yehi Zichro Boruch. Zachariah Gelley, Rav Dr. Erich Erlbach, President Samson R. Bechhofer, Conductor A.J. Gutmann, Conductor (Ret.)</p>
        <p>SILBERMINTZ - Seymour. On June 18, 2000 after a long illness. Age 83. Beloved husband of Elaine for 49 years. Devoted father and father-in-law of Shelley and Jeff, Tobe and Naomi. Dear brother of Theodore and the late Aaron and Joshua. Adored grandfather of David, Akiva, Jonathan, Ariel, Sharona, Yaeli, Elisha and Talya. Unforgettable music teacher and choir leader for over 60 years. Shiva Monday through Wednesday at 27-71 Edgehill Road, Riverdale, NY, Thursday through Sunday morning at 921 Peninsula Boulevard, Woodmere, NY.</p>
