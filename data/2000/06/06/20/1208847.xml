        <p>This was not your ordinary bee. There were no tricky spelling or geography questions. For this competition, talented students had to endure grease, grime and muggy weather.</p>
        <p>But the pot for this national shop bee was a quarter of a million dollars, to be divided among the top 10 teams.</p>
        <p>With the Washington Monument towering behind them, an international cast of high school seniors, clad in white jumpsuits with red and black racing stripes, competed today in a contest to be the fastest at fixing balky automobile engines.</p>
        <p>Two-member teams from every state, Puerto Rico, Argentina, Australia and Canada battled the clock and ''bugged'' Mercury Grand Marquis engines for the prizes and scholarships.</p>
        <p>The team from Maui High School, in Kahului, Hawaii, which restored its car to working condition in the shortest time, topped the team from Oregon by one minute and seven seconds. The Hawaii team of Steven Garrard, 17, and David Sharp, 17, both seniors at Maui High, completed the repairs in just under 35 minutes.</p>
        <p>''I have to thank the guys because they were the ones in the field doing the work,'' said Dennis Ishii, 51, the students' instructor. ''We've been close a couple of times before, but this is unbelievable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ishii and the two students finished in second place at last year's competition. And a team from Maui High won in 1995.</p>
        <p>''I was really nervous this morning, but it went away once we got started,'' said Mr. Garrard, whose team met for a couple of hours each school day this year in preparation for the event.</p>
        <p>The contest, which has been held annually since 1949, was sponsored by the Ford Motor Company and the American Automobile Association.</p>
        <p>Before packed bleacher seats on the Mall here, the teams repaired cars that had identical electrical and engine problems. A judge supervised each team's efforts, and supplied replacement parts as needed.</p>
        <p>When a team determined that the car was back in working order, it slammed the hood shut, signaled a timer to stop the clock and jumped into the driver's seat for a short road test.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, each team member took a 100-question written examination. The multiple-choice examination tested the students' ability to respond to ''typical repair shop situations,'' said David Van Sickel of the American Automobile Association.</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Van Sickel said, a contestant might be asked to diagnose a car that is pulling toward the right when the brakes are applied.</p>
        <p>In this year's competition, students from Minnesota finished third, followed by teams from California and Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>Timothy DeBoer, 18, a member of the second-place team from Vale High School in Vale, Ore., was disappointed that his team came up short. On the other hand, Mr. DeBoer said, ''it was definitely easier than taking the SAT's.''</p>
