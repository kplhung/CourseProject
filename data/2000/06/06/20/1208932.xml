        <p>The Yankees were 20-8 on May 7, steadily building their lead in the American League East, playing at a pace that would have them chasing all the records they set in 1998. But the Yankees have gone 15-21 since, including a 22-1 rout of the Boston Red Sox tonight in the opener of a four-game series. Regardless of how they do in this series, which comes on the heels of a four-game losing streak, they are ready to make changes.</p>
        <p>Orlando Hernandez sprained his right elbow on Sunday and will miss his next start and maybe more, and there is a chance he will join Roger Clemens on the disabled list. There is no longer time for patience, and the Yankees will delve deeper into trade talks for the slugging outfielders Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs and Juan Gonzalez of the Detroit Tigers.</p>
        <p>The Cubs are expected to name their asking price to the Yankees by the end of the week, according to a baseball official, and the Yankees will finally know how much it will take to get Sosa. Club executives have been told it will take a significant package to get Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, would not comment on his talks, but other baseball officials say he is searching intensely for at least one trade to augment the lineup and to add a pitcher. Despite Hernandez's sprained elbow, the Yankees feel he may be able to pitch soon and avoid the disabled list.</p>
        <p>But Hernandez is apparently concerned enough about his elbow to seek a second opinion. He will visit James Andrews, the noted surgeon, in Alabama on Wednesday. ''He just wants to make sure two people agree,'' Manager Joe Torre said. ''I can understand; it's his career.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees, like many teams, will sometimes be vague about the nature of injuries to their players -- the art of strategic deception. So executives with other teams were curious today about Hernandez's status. Elbow sprains are usually serious injuries, knocking out pitchers for at least six weeks. The Yankees announced in April that outfielder Roberto Kelly had a sprained elbow, and it did not become clear until later that Kelly was facing reconstructive surgery.</p>
        <p>But while Yankees officials are not sure when Hernandez will pitch next, they maintained today that they did not think Hernandez's elbow injury was serious.</p>
        <p>Executives with other teams are watching the situation closely because they want to get a sense of how desperate the Yankees are to make a deal for one of the very few quality pitchers who are available. The team's front office is stocked with successful executives, Cone said before tonight's game.</p>
        <p>''Now is the time to let them do their job,'' he added. ''I don't envy Brian Cashman right now.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees could ask about the likes of Brad Radke of the Minnesota Twins and Curt Schilling of the Philadelphia Phillies. Dwight Gooden, recently signed to a minor league contract, has been in Florida at the team's facility and working on a split-finger fastball. But they may have more luck trying to add a pitcher to a blockbuster deal for Sosa or Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>Yankees officials have been braced for more than a week to hear the asking price from the Cubs, who are expected to ask for a truckload of prospects, players like infielders Alfonso Soriano and Drew Henson. It also figures that outfielder Ricky Ledee will be included in any trade; interestingly, he may be the only real marketable player on the major league roster, for the rest of the team consists of players the Yankees need to make a run for the championship, or they are older and expensive.</p>
        <p>The Yankees would also have to agree to a contract extension with Sosa, who has a no-trade clause in his contract and can control everything that happens, for something in the range of $18 million to $20 million a year. If the Yankees and the Cubs can somehow agree to a package of players for Sosa, it will probably not be difficult to have a pitcher added to the swap, as well, someone like Kevin Tapani or Ismael Valdes.</p>
        <p>Soriano would almost certainly be included in any deal for Gonzalez, and it figures the Tigers would ask about Henson, too, although there are continuing doubts about whether Henson, a star quarterback for the University of Michigan, will even continue his baseball career after the coming football season.</p>
        <p>The Tigers were roundly criticized for passing on Henson in the 1998 draft, and would probably like him, but considering the tenuous nature of his baseball career, a deal with the Yankees would have to be anchored around a prospect other than Henson.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have also talked continually with the Kansas City Royals about outfielder Johnny Damon and with the Baltimore Orioles about the veteran outfielder B. J. Surhoff.</p>
        <p>If the Yankees and Tigers agree to a package for Gonzalez, then a pitcher like Dave Mlicki, a former Met, who has two years remaining on the three-year, $15.25 million deal he signed before this year, or Hideo Nomo, another former Met, who has been pitching effectively for the Tigers, could be involved.</p>
        <p>Jake Westbrook, the rookie who was pounded in his Yankees debut last Saturday, will start Thursday against the Red Sox.</p>
        <p>The Yankees did not know tonight who would pitch Friday in Chicago; they do not even know if Friday's starter is currently a member of their roster.</p>
        <p>Major changes are on the horizon.</p>
