        <p>When women reach menopause, many struggle with the decision of whether to take hormone replacement therapy. It often comes down to weighing the compelling benefits against the disturbing drawbacks.</p>
        <p>The benefits are relief of symptoms like hot flashes and insomnia as well as a lowered risk of osteoporosis and of high cholesterol. (Until recently, many doctors believed that hormone replacement therapy also reduces risk of heart disease, but that finding has now been questioned.) The drawbacks, most notably, are an increased risk of blood clots and breast cancer.</p>
        <p>A growing number of postmenopausal women, however, are trying to sidestep the decision altogether by choosing a third route. They have turned to ''natural'' alternatives to hormone replacement, including foods and herbal supplements containing plant estrogens, phytoestrogens, which have estrogen-like effects when taken by humans. They are also using creams made with the hormone progesterone, and cocktails made up of vitamins, minerals and herbs.</p>
        <p>At low doses, most experts say, most of these natural remedies are probably safe. But they worry that some women are being overzealous in their self-treatment and taking supplements in unsafe doses.</p>
        <p>The greatest concern is for women with estrogen-dependent breast cancer. They are advised not to take hormone replacement because the estrogen in it may feed breast cancers, but some are taking large doses of these phytoestrogens that may be just as harmful.</p>
        <p>''What worries me is how women are not willing to go on hormone replacement therapy, but willing to go on a supplemental medicine, without any information but hearsay that it's safe,'' said Dr. William Helferich, an associate professor of nutrition at the University of Illinois.</p>
        <p>Indeed, sales of supplements for menopause have risen greatly in recent years. In 1999, sales of soy isoflavones, the phytoestrogen in soy, rose to $21 million in supermarkets and drug stores, more than triple 1998 sales. Sales for all in-one menopausal formulas were $36.20 million last year, an increase of 197 percent, according to Spins and ACNielsen, market research firms. Sales of other popular herbs used to treat symptoms of menopause, like black cohosh, flaxseed, red clover, dong quai and wild yam, are also on the rise.</p>
        <p>Eating soy and their isoflavones are the most popular natural way to increase estrogen. Soy has estrogenic properties, and like hormone replacement, appears to lower cholesterol and reduce bone loss in postmenopausal women, though studies have not shown that it reduces hot flashes.</p>
        <p>Some studies suggest that soy foods may prevent cancers. This research, largely based on population surveys, has found that women in Japan, who eat a lot of soy, also have a low incidence of breast cancer, although the relationship is far from proven.</p>
        <p>Laboratory and animal studies have found conflicting results, with some studies finding that soy isoflavones act as anticancer agents and others finding that the isoflavones may promote some breast tumors.</p>
        <p>Or it could be that isoflavones do both.  Some scientists theorize that when eaten early in life, as in Japan, foods with soy in them may help prevent cancer.</p>
        <p>''The way it may be protective in young women is that the phytoestrogens may hasten the maturation of breast cells, and once they're mature, they're less susceptible to the effects of carcinogens,'' said Dr. Margo Woods, associate professor of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine, who specializes in diet, hormones and breast cancer.</p>
        <p>Soy, when added to the estrogen that is normally present in young women, may make breast cells mature at a much faster rate and protect against cancer. However, researchers believe that girls who menstruate early, and also are exposed to added estrogen, are not similarly protected, because without soy, levels of estrogen are too low to help mature breast cells.</p>
        <p>But many American women are introducing soy into the diet late in life, or are bypassing the tofu and going directly to supplements that contain concentrated doses of soy protein or isoflavones. This high-level, late-in-life intake, these scientists say, may promote cancer.</p>
        <p>''It's wise to use soy foods, like soy milk and tofu, in moderate amounts in your diet,'' said Dr. Sadja Greenwood, an assistant clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California at San Francisco. ''But to use the isolated soy proteins or the isolated isoflavone pills is very unwise, as we don't know the effects of them.''</p>
        <p>Isoflavones are a hundred to a thousand times less potent than the estrogen used in hormone replacement, but one can easily consume hundreds of times more of them in the supplements on the market -- far more than what Japanese women consume. Some capsules contain as much as 500 milligrams of isoflavones, while the average daily intake in Japan is 25 to 50 milligrams.</p>
        <p>Proving most promising for relieving hot flashes is black cohosh, an herb long used in American Indian cultures and studied in Germany for more than 50 years. It is the most thoroughly studied herb for treating symptoms of menopause, and research has found it fairly effective against hot flashes, mood changes and vaginal dryness, said Dr. Varro E. Tyler, professor emeritus of pharmacognosy at Purdue University. It may be the safest too. No studies have found any known phytoestrogens in the herb.</p>
        <p>''We don't know how it works -- it may have unknown phytoestrogens or it may work in some other way to reduce hot flashes,'' said Dr. Fredi Kronenberg, director of the Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.</p>
        <p>''I think the jury is still out whether this is O.K. for women with breast cancer or not,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Moreover, black cohosh, like other supplements, is being sold in higher and higher doses in the United States, encouraging women to consume more than what has been used in traditional cultures. Capsules today contain as much as 250 milligrams; in Germany, where herbal remedies are regulated, the recommended dose is 40. And in Germany, women are advised not to take it for more than six months, because there are no long-term studies.</p>
        <p>Women are taking a number of other phytoestrogens, like dong quai, red clover and flaxseed to relieve hot flashes, but there is little research on their effectiveness and safety.</p>
        <p>Dong quai has been used in combination with other herbs in traditional Chinese medicine to treat hot flashes, but many Americans are taking it alone, though one controlled study found it ineffective on its own. Red clover, a potent phytoestrogen, has not been used to treat menopause symptoms in traditional cultures, so little is known about its safety and effectiveness. Flaxseeds are even less studied.</p>
        <p>Those women hoping to lower their risk of heart disease by taking phytoestrogens may want to reconsider the strategy. Two recent studies challenge the long-held belief that taking estrogen protects against heart disease. One study found that  undergoing hormone replacement therapy with estrogen and progestin (a form of the hormone progesterone) for four years failed to lower the risk of heart attacks in women who already had heart disease. A second study that measured the arteries of women with heart disease found that taking hormones did not slow the buildup of cholesterol in their arteries.</p>
        <p>Women who are taking high doses of these phytoestrogens also need to consider their risks for endometrial cancer, a cancer of the uterine lining. More than two decades ago, a form of progesterone was added to the estrogen in hormone replacement therapy, because taking estrogen alone was found to increase the risk of this cancer.</p>
        <p>So should women taking phytoestrogens also be taking progesterone? ''We just don't know,'' said Dr. Kronenberg.</p>
        <p>Some women use creams derived from plants like wild yams, which some have thought acted like progesterone, to try to counter the risk. But in fact, wild yams have been found neither to relieve symptoms of menopause nor prevent endometrial cancer.</p>
        <p>''We call it the yam scam,'' said Dr. Tyler. Wild yams can be converted to progesterone in the laboratory, but not so in the body.</p>
        <p>Taking vitamin E is another approach to alleviating hot flashes. Studies have found some minor benefits when women take high doses -- about 800 International Units, known as I.U.'s. (A recent report from the Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences, warned that higher does of Vitamin E could be harmful.)</p>
        <p>And many women have turned to the all-in-one menopausal pills, which seem to contain low doses of every supplement and herb that has ever been used in the same sentence with the word ''woman.''</p>
        <p>''They're putting subtherapeutic doses of everything in these capsules, but we don't know if subtherapeutic A plus subtherapeutic B equals an effect, or if it's useless because it's not enough of anything,'' Dr. Kronenberg said.</p>
        <p>Postmenopausal women who are worried about their risk of heart disease and osteoporosis can lower their risks through lifestyle and diet. To minimize bone loss, postmenopausal women are advised to do weight-bearing exercise and take calcium and vitamin D supplements.  To lower risk of heart disease, women should exercise, not smoke, keep weight in the normal range and eat a healthy diet.</p>
