        <p>The Baron Capital Group, a New York mutual fund that is the largest outside shareholder of Sotheby's, filed a notice with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday  saying that it continues to believe that electing the son of the former chairman and some of his friends to the board would present a conflict of interest.</p>
        <p>A. Alfred Taubman, the real estate developer who is Sotheby's largest shareholder, resigned in February amid allegations of price-fixing at the company. Mr. Taubman, who retains voting control of the company and its board through stock ownership, wanted his son Robert to take his place on the board.</p>
        <p>Ronald Baron, chairman and chief executive of Baron Capital, first voiced his objections in April just before the company's annual meeting. It was postponed as Mr. Baron pushed Sotheby's board to distance itself from its former chairman. Yesterday, however, Sotheby's announced that the meeting had been rescheduled. It will occur on Aug. 3 at its York Avenue headquarters.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's plans to expand its board to 14 members from 10 at the annual meeting. Mr. Taubman's ownership of 63 percent of the Class B shares gives him the power to elect 10 directors, while Baron's ownership of 55 percent of the Class A stock carries enough votes to elect the other four.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's said yesterday that on behalf of the Class A shareholders, it had nominated four people: George Blumenthal, chairman and founder of NTL Inc., a provider of business and residential telecommunications services in Europe; Steven Dodge, chairman, president and chief executive of the American Tower Corporation, an owner and operator of broadcast and communications towers throughout the United States; Henry Jarecki, chairman of the Falconwood Corporation, an investment banking company; and Brian Posner, co-founder and managing partner of Hygrove Partners, an investment management company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baron filed a notice yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission in which he said that he ''remains dissatisfied with the independence of certain Class B directors.'' Besides Robert Taubman, the Class B directors include Jeffrey Miro, one of Mr. Taubman's lawyers, and Max Fisher, a business associate who is one of Mr. Taubman's closest friends.</p>
