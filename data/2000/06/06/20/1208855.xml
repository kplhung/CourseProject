        <p>Plunging deeply into the world of pocket-sized personal computing, I.B.M. will introduce today a version of its tiny Microdrive hard drive with a storage capacity of a billion bytes of information.</p>
        <p>The new drive, which is the size of a book of matches, is a milestone in the evolution of magnetic storage, I.B.M. executives said, because it surpasses the same one-gigabyte barrier the company's original refrigerator-sized 3380 hard drive surmounted in the 1980's.</p>

        <p>Plunging deeply into the world of pocket-sized personal computing, I.B.M. will introduce today a version of its tiny Microdrive hard drive with a storage capacity of a billion bytes of information.</p>
        <p>The new drive, which is the size of a book of matches, is a milestone in the evolution of magnetic storage, I.B.M. executives said, because it surpasses the same one-gigabyte barrier the company's original refrigerator-sized 3380 hard drive surmounted in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>The smaller size and accelerating density of magnetic storage systems are one of the remarkable stories of Silicon Valley. Disk storage is now increasing at a rate faster than the legendary Moore's Law improvement rate of the semiconductor industry.</p>
        <p>Moore's Law is the observation that the number of transistors that can be squeezed onto a silicon chip doubles roughly every 18 months.</p>
        <p>When the first 340-megabyte Microdrive was introduced a year ago, it had a storage density of 5.04 billion bits a square inch. The current drive, which will ship commercially in September, has increased that density to 15.2 billion bits a square inch. The higher density means the tiny new drive is within 10 percent of the most advanced I.B.M. storage products now on the market, said John Osterhout, the marketing director for I.B.M.'s storage business.</p>
        <p>The company said that it expected about one-third of the market for the new drives to be as storage devices for digital cameras. A one-gigabyte drive, which fits in the same storage slot as a flash memory card, could hold up to 1,000 high-resolution photographs, a thousand 200-page novels, or nearly 10 hours of high-quality digital audio music, the company said.</p>
        <p>The company said that another third of the market would come as backup and data-transfer media for notebook and desktop computers. But in the future the company is most interested in an array of new markets based on hand-held computing devices like personal digital assistants and advanced digital cellular phones.</p>
        <p>Shares of I.B.M. rose $6.375 yesterday, to $120.125.</p>
        <p>To make its disk drives more attractive for the coming market in wearable computers, I.B.M. said it had increased the shock resistance of the newest generation Microdrive, which will sell for $499, to the ability to withstand a 1500-G shock. That is equivalent to a drop from a normal office desk onto a medium-thickness carpet, Mr. Osterhout said.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. has added tiny rubber bumpers to the corners of its newest drives to add to their reliability.</p>
        <p>One company that has already built a version of a tiny personal computer based around the Microdrive is Tiqit Computers, a Palo Alto, Calif., company started by Vaughan Pratt, a Stanford computer scientist.</p>
        <p>The company makes a palm-sized computer that it advertises as the world's smallest system that can run operating systems like Windows 95, Windows NT and Linux. The tiny computer, which currently has a 486-class processor manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices, is 5 cubic inches and weighs 3.3 ounces. The Tiqit Matchbox PC is priced at $1,495.</p>
