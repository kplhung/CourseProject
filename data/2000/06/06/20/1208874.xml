        <p>In one of the broadest recent attacks on employment practices in the telecommunications industry, more than 300 current and former employees of Nextel Communications Inc., a fast-growing wireless communications carrier, intend to file complaints of racial and sexual discrimination at the company, the employees' lawyers said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The lawyers said that they intend to file 25 complaints today with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against Nextel on behalf of workers in Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio and Tennessee. Later this week, the lawyers intend to file 25 additional complaints representing employees in states including Alabama, California, Florida and Virginia.</p>
        <p>The lawyers intend to file 50 additional complaints each week until all 302 complaints have been submitted.</p>
        <p>Nextel, based in Reston, Va., is one of the fastest-growing wireless communications providers in the nation. Financed largely by Motorola Inc. and Craig O. McCaw, the cellular telephone pioneer, Nextel now serves more than 5.5 million subscribers.</p>
        <p>As they file the complaints with the employment commission, the workers' lawyers intend to ask the commission's permission to file lawsuits against the company in federal court under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The lawyers, who say they have worked with the Nextel workers for nine months, said they intended to seek class-action status for the lawsuit and said they intended to seek millions of dollars in damages. The lawyers also said they intended to ask that Nextel, which has a market value of $51 billion, be required to make a multibillion-dollar commitment to sensitivity training and diversity in hiring and promotion.</p>
        <p>''At this point we have not received any official complaints, and when we do receive any such official complaint we will certainly investigate and respond appropriately,'' Randall C. Harris, Nextel's senior vice president for human resources, said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''Until such time that we receive such official complaint there is no other response that would be warranted.''</p>
        <p>Copies of the 25 complaints that are to be filed today were provided to The New York Times yesterday by the workers' law firm, Leeds Morelli &amp; Brown, based in Manhattan. The law firm also provided a list of 302 current and former Nextel employees that the firm said intended to file complaints. Jeffrey K. Brown, a partner at the firm, said yesterday that he was willing to provide copies of the complaints to Nextel on request before the complaints were filed.</p>
        <p>''Nextel is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world and they are trying to promote an image of diversity when the facts are that within the corridors of Nextel, minority employees are harassed and mistreated solely on the basis of their race,'' Mr. Brown said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said that his firm contacted Nextel in March. In April, he provided the company with details of some workers' complaints and also met with Nextel lawyers in Virginia.</p>
        <p>''It's been very slow,'' Mr. Brown said. ''In my opinion they did not take this seriously, nor do they believe thay have a problem on hand.''</p>
        <p>Of the 25 complaints to be filed today, 24 claim racial discrimination and 6 claim sexual discrimination.</p>
        <p>Most of the employees set to file complaints are black. According to the complaints, they were routinely treated unfairly and many said they were passed over for raises or promotions, sometimes in favor of less-experienced or less-capable white workers. Some minority workers said they were made to do more than other employees of similar experience.</p>
        <p>In some of the complaints, the workers said they were made to feel uncomfortable by derogatory comments made by supervisors or fellow workers. In his complaint, one black worker said that when he arrived for a job in Atlanta, he received harassing calls from other Nextel employees in which he was repeatedly called a racial epithet. The same employee said that he was punished professionally for not responding positively to the sexual overtures of a white female supervisor and also overheard comments that implied that his employment was sufficient to fill a racial quota.</p>
        <p>In his complaint, an employee in Colorado said that a white ''team leader'' suggested that he call himself ''darky'' when his office had a ''theme day.'' A Hispanic worker in Colorado said he was called ''thug'' in addition to more pointed epithets. A black salesman in Tennessee said  that his manager said, ''Blacks and women have no business in the workplace,'' and denied a request for a transfer to a more affluent area because ''they don't like black people there.''</p>
        <p>Filing with the employment commission is a necessary first step in most workplace racial and sexual harassment proceedings. The commission rarely takes cases to court itself; last year, it received 77,444 complaints and filed 465 suits against employers. But after filing a complaint, a worker can petition the commission for permission to sue independently.</p>
        <p>In earlier decades, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company faced accusations of racial discrimination. But the telecommunications industry generally has not faced such broad discrimination lawsuits as those leveled against Coca-Cola.</p>
