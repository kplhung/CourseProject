        <p>In the 10th inning of a tie game with the Arizona Diamondbacks this month, two Chicago Cubs outfielders brushed against each other while trying to catch a fly ball with two outs. The ball fell to the ground and the Diamondbacks went on to score two runs. The official scorer charged center fielder Damon Buford with an error but later changed the ruling and assigned the error to the right fielder: Sammy Sosa.</p>

        <p>In the 10th inning of a tie game with the Arizona Diamondbacks this month, two Chicago Cubs outfielders brushed against each other while trying to catch a fly ball with two outs. The ball fell to the ground and the Diamondbacks went on to score two runs. The official scorer charged center fielder Damon Buford with an error but later changed the ruling and assigned the error to the right fielder: Sammy Sosa.</p>
        <p>After the game, after the Cubs had rallied for three runs and a 4-3 victory, the right fielder asked a member of the Cubs' front-office staff to talk to Manager Don Baylor about the ruling. If Baylor felt it was Buford's error, Sosa thought, maybe he could get the official scorer to change his call back to Buford. The manager, though, believed the right ruling had been made because Buford had called for the ball.</p>
        <p>The next day, Sosa, in effect, declared war on Baylor, telling reporters that the manager had not treated him ''the way I'm supposed to be treated.'' Baylor, he added, ''has got no class.''</p>
        <p>Sosa did not tell the reporters how he had wanted Baylor to get involved in the error call. His unusually sharp comments were attributed to statements Baylor had previously made about Sosa's deteriorating defense, among other facets of his game, that Baylor saw as coming up short.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the schism between the new manager and his superstar had been created and would add fuel to the Sosa situation that has exploded on the North Side of Chicago.</p>
        <p>The betting around baseball is that Sosa's name will be added to the list of glamour players who have been traded since the end of last season, a group that includes Ken Griffey Jr., Juan Gonzalez and Shawn Green. If so, it will be one of the more intriguing developments of recent seasons.</p>
        <p>Sosa is the No. 1 player in a city where he wants to stay, certainly one of the most popular in Chicago's checkered baseball history. He is a premier slugger, having hit 129 home runs the previous two seasons.</p>
        <p>But other factors are at work, and not just Sosa's clash with Baylor. The Cubs' real star anyway is Wrigley Field, a baseball anomaly that the team may feel will fill up even without Sosa. Also, the Tribune Company, the team's owner, would not want to pay upward of $15 million a year to keep Sosa.</p>
        <p>In that way, Sosa will join a growing list of superstars who are being traded before they can become free agents. In the other instances, the players were traded a year before they could become free agents because their teams concluded that they could not sign them or did not want to pay what it would cost to keep them.</p>
        <p>Griffey went from Seattle to Cincinnati, Gonzalez from Texas to Detroit, Green from Toronto to Los Angeles. Mike Hampton went from Houston to the Mets, Carl Everett from Houston to Boston and Jim Edmonds from Anaheim to St. Louis. These players, in effect, were premature free agents.</p>
        <p>Sosa, who because of his scintillating home run race with Mark McGwire in 1998 has perhaps grown even bigger than Griffey in stature, would be in that position this winter, but he may be even more premature than last winter's group.</p>
        <p>Just as his trade value is probably at its highest now, so is his ability to get a monster contract. The combination of value to the Cubs and value to Sosa is the reason this entire situation has blossomed.</p>
        <p>''I would say there are three different things that could happen,'' Andy MacPhail, the Cubs' president, said the other day. ''Reach agreement on a contract extension. Trade him. Not do anything since we're fortunate to have the player signed through 2001. I can't assign a probability to any one of those.''</p>
        <p>No one outside the Cubs has expressed the opinion that they will sign Sosa to a contract extension. The Tribune Company is one of the most hard-line owners in Major League Baseball, ranks 13th among the 30 clubs with a $60.5 million payroll this season and has shown no inclination to spend in the lofty stratosphere where salaries of elite players is headed, $15 million to $20 million a year.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, there is the sense in and out of Chicago that the Cubs don't have to spend top dollar to try to win because the Wrigley Field experience attracts fans, win or lose. The Cubs, who have not won a World Series since 1908 or played in one since 1945, have long been known as the most lovable losers in baseball.</p>
        <p>The prevailing view among baseball officials is that the Cubs will trade Sosa sometime before the July 31 deadline for making trades without needing waivers.</p>
        <p>''You don't let it go this far if you're not going to make a deal,'' one veteran official said. ''They've let it go on too long. Their responses have been vague. If you're going to keep a guy, you don't do this. I think Sammy wants out. I didn't think so a week ago; I think that today.''</p>
        <p>Yet MacPhail and General Manager Ed Lynch have not acknowledged their intentions to trade Sosa.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't make that assumption,'' MacPhail said. ''It's not something you can generate a lot of excitement from the chair I'm sitting in. But you have a responsibility that if something is going to make you better, you have to review it. But it's not a foregone conclusion from my point of view.''</p>
        <p>This is Sosa's ninth season with the Cubs. As he has said, he has become an icon in Chicago. Because he loves the city and its people and the whole Wrigley experience, he would prefer to be with the Cubs the rest of his career. Not, however, without an appropriate contract.</p>
        <p>Adam Katz, who with Tom Reich represents Sosa, has met with MacPhail but said that he made no demands and that he doesn't know what the Cubs will do.</p>
        <p>''We've discussed our desire to have them decide what they want to do,'' Katz said. ''We all agree it's time to decide. If they want to sign Sammy and keep him, then my bet is they could pull that off quickly. If they want to trade him, we'll be cooperative. My desire is to be collaborative and cooperative. I don't want to press them. I think it's still possible for both sides to get what they want. Whether that's together or apart, I don't know.''</p>
        <p>The possibility that the Cubs will trade Sosa has become the premier story of the season. Newspapers and radio and television air time in Chicago, New York and Boston have been filled with Sosa stories. Will he or won't he, and where?</p>
        <p>The Cubs have fueled the speculation by sending scouts to scrutinize major and minor league players of the teams they think are most seriously interested. The Yankees and the Red Sox are the two clubs with the hottest interest, officials of other clubs said. The Mets' interest, some say, has been overrated. The Diamondbacks, they also say, have some interest, though not as much at this point as the Yankees and Boston.</p>
        <p>The Yankees expect to hear from the Cubs by the end of this week on what players the Cubs would want for Sosa.</p>
        <p>From Sosa's standpoint, he has the collective bargaining right to veto a trade, which means the team that makes a trade with the Cubs has to be prepared to sign Sosa to a new contract or face his veto. Under baseball rules, the Cubs would make a contingency trade with a team, then give that team 72 hours in which to negotiate with Sosa's agents.</p>
        <p>Besides a torrent of speculative news media reports, the Sosa situation has generated a rush of analyses and columns urging the Yankees not to trade for the outfielder on the grounds that he wouldn't fit in with the low-key, star-free environment that is their clubhouse.</p>
        <p>One criticism of Sosa has been that he has fallen in love with his image as a megastar and has changed in the last two years. Katz said the assessment is nonsense, but others point to specific examples.</p>
        <p>Sosa's entourage, for one. After emerging from the 1998 season as a world-class hero, Sosa gathered a group of about 10 to 12 people around him who were steady visitors to the clubhouse last season. Baylor has curtailed the entourage this season, perhaps another reason Sosa has soured on him.</p>
        <p>Then there was the visiting parking list at Pacific Bell Park when the Cubs played in San Francisco last month. Baylor, as manager, was on the list with one other member of the team: Sosa. MacPhail, the club's president, was on the trip but not on the parking list.</p>
        <p>But it is the disclosure of stories like these along with the suggestion that Sosa has become a one-dimensional player that prompts the Sosa camp to believe the Cubs have orchestrated a campaign to reduce the player in stature in the fans' eyes.</p>
        <p>If the Wrigley regulars come to think less of Sosa, the thinking goes, they will be less bothered if and when he is traded.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the fans and a handful of eager teams wait to find out if he will be traded.</p>
