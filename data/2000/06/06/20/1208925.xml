        <p>Nearly a million low-income parents have lost Medicaid coverage and have probably become uninsured since Congress and the states began overhauling the nation's welfare programs in 1996, a consumer group said in a new study today.</p>
        <p>The group, Families USA, said the number of low-income parents enrolled in Medicaid in 15 states had declined by 945,880, or 27 percent -- to 2,557,673 in December 1999, from 3,503,553 in January 1996.</p>
        <p>Those states are home to 70 percent of the uninsured adults who are under the age of 65 and have incomes less than twice the poverty level, or under $28,300 for a family of three.</p>
        <p>When it passed a landmark welfare law in 1996, Congress tried to guarantee continuation of Medicaid coverage for people losing cash assistance. But many states did not carry out the requirements of the law, and until recently federal officials said they were unaware of any serious problems.</p>
        <p>Under federal law, people leaving welfare are automatically entitled to health insurance under Medicaid for six months to a year, but states have not always provided this coverage.</p>
        <p>Families USA did not trace individual families who left welfare, but other studies have found that adults in such families typically take low-paying jobs that do not offer health benefits. Even if parents are offered insurance by employers, they are often unable to pay the premiums.</p>
        <p>Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, said: ''Our study shows that hundreds of thousands of low-wage working parents were cast adrift without health insurance when they did the right thing and found jobs. Most parents moving from welfare to work are in jobs that provide no health coverage, but they are losing their Medicaid lifeline.''</p>
        <p>The study said that Medicaid enrollment of parents had dropped by 155,846, or 19 percent, in California; by 123,630, or 25 percent, in New York; by 95,854, or 42 percent, in Ohio; and by 106,012, or 46 percent, in Texas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pollack said that New York and Ohio had liberalized eligibility standards for Medicaid in the last year so more parents would qualify.</p>
        <p>Economists said the number of people on welfare and Medicaid might be expected to decline in a booming economy, which has reduced the unemployment rate to the lowest level in three decades.</p>
        <p>But in an interview, Mr. Pollack said: ''If Medicaid enrollment declines while the number of uninsured grows, there is obviously a problem. Reductions in Medicaid enrollment are, in fact, fueling an increase in the number of people who are uninsured.''</p>
        <p>Melissa T. Skolfield, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said: ''The report by Families USA shows that there is a lot of state-to-state variation. States can and should do more to expand Medicaid coverage for people leaving welfare.''</p>
        <p>Until recently, federal officials did not acknowledge that the 1996 welfare law was contributing to an increase in the uninsured. In May 1999,  Ms. Skolfield said it was ''too early to know for sure if there is a cause-and-effect relationship.''</p>
        <p>Researchers say hundreds of thousands of children also lost Medicaid when their families lost welfare benefits. But the decline in children's insurance coverage has been offset, to some extent, by the creation of federal and state health programs specifically for children.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pollack said most states imposed strict limits on the income that a parent could earn and still qualify for Medicaid. In 32 states, he said, parents who work full time at the minimum wage of $5.15 an hour are considered to have too much income to qualify for Medicaid.</p>
        <p>''In Louisiana, Virginia and Texas,'' Mr. Pollack said, ''parents working at the minimum wage are disqualified from Medicaid if they work more than 12, 17 and 18 hours a week, respectively.''</p>
        <p>In April, the Clinton administration ordered states to restore Medicaid benefits to families who had been improperly deprived of such coverage. State officials say they have begun to comply.</p>
