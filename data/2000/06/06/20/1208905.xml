        <p>Michael Skakel, charged with killing 15-year-old Martha Moxley in Greenwich in 1975, is to return to state court Tuesday, where a judge will open an unusual hearing to decide whether the 39-year-old defendant should be tried as a juvenile or an adult.</p>
        <p>The hearing could last a few hours or several weeks, depending on how much evidence Judge Maureen Dennis of Superior Court decides to allow state prosecutors and Mr. Skakel's lawyer to present. But several lawyers following the case said they expected the proceeding to take about four or five days, spread out over this week and next.</p>
        <p>Many legal experts familiar with the case said they believed the judge would order Mr. Skakel's trial moved from Juvenile Court to Superior Court, where he would be tried as an adult.</p>
        <p>''My guess is that he will be transferred to an adult court,'' said William Dunlap, a professor of criminal law at Quinnipiac College in Hamden, Conn. Noting Mr. Skakel's age, he added, ''Having him tried as a juvenile seems like a farce.''</p>
        <p>At the hearing, prosecutors will present several witnesses to bolster their case against Mr. Skakel and will urge that the case be moved to adult court. Defense lawyers will move to have the charges dismissed.</p>
        <p>If convicted in Superior Court, Mr. Skakel would face 25 years to life in prison. In Juvenile Court, the sentence would be far shorter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, was charged by state prosecutors as a juvenile because he was 15 when Ms. Moxley was found bludgeoned to death under a tree in her family's yard a quarter century ago.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors believe Miss Moxley was killed with a 6-iron golf club, pieces of which were found around her body. The club had come from a set owned by the Skakel family, the authorities have said.</p>
        <p>To determine whether to move Mr. Skakel's case to an adult court, Judge Dennis must operate under the laws in place in 1975.</p>
        <p>A juvenile charged with murder now is automatically tried as an adult, but in 1975, when attempting rehabilitation was the preferred method for dealing with violent youths, such a move was rare. To try a child as an adult, a judge had to find ''reasonable cause'' to take the youth out of the juvenile court system.</p>
        <p>''She's looking at the law then,'' said one Connecticut juvenile court lawyer, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. ''It's a 1975 courtroom tomorrow, except that it's open to the press. It's unheard of. We've never had a case where we've had to go back 25 years.''</p>
        <p>Despite the greater burden the 1975 laws place on the prosecution, Professor Dunlap said, Mr. Skakel is unlikely to retain his legal status as a juvenile.</p>
        <p>''Since it was possible to try him as an adult in 1975,'' he said, ''and since it is almost automatic that he would be tried as an adult if the crime were committed today, I think he'll be moved to Superior Court.''</p>
        <p>Jonathan Benedict, the state's attorney prosecuting Mr. Skakel, is likely to present an array of witnesses, including a former Greenwich police chief and former students at a school for troubled youths that Mr. Skakel attended in the early 1980's. Mr. Benedict did not return calls seeking comment today.</p>
        <p>Mickey Sherman, Mr. Skakel's lawyer, said he believed Mr. Benedict had no physical evidence linking Mr. Skakel to Miss Moxley's murder. But based on the few clues they have in the case, prosecutors believe the girl knew her killer. Mr. Skakel lived next door to Miss Moxley.</p>
        <p>One piece of evidence they seem likely to bring out in the days ahead is an eight-page autopsy report. The report, obtained from Greenwich police records, found that the killer had battered Miss Moxley's head and neck with 13 powerful blows from a blunt object. It details how several blows carved deep crescent-shaped wounds on the upper part of her head; other wounds struck bone.</p>
        <p>The wounds detailed in the report -- by Dr. Elliot M. Gross, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy -- suggest that Miss Moxley probably died from three blows that fractured the back of her skull and penetrated her brain, said Dr. John H. Sinard, a Yale pathologist who studied the report at the request of The New York Times.</p>
        <p>While she lay prone but still alive, Miss Moxley was also stabbed completely through her neck, most likely with the golf club's shaft, the autopsy found. The autopsy did not give investigators any clues to the killer's identity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sherman said he would attack prosecution witnesses in the hope of casting the the charges against his client as too weak to warrant a Superior Court trial.</p>
        <p>''This is going to be the first opportunity that we have to, No. 1, confront and, No. 2, cross-examine these witnesses,'' Mr. Sherman said today. ''That is immeasurably important. Other than their spoken words, there's no evidence to connect Michael Skakel with that crime.''</p>
        <p>Once the hearing concludes, the judge will probably issue her decision within a few weeks, lawyers said.</p>
        <p>Judge Dennis is still considering a  request by five newspapers, including The Times, to grant public access to the case's court documents, under seal since Mr. Skakel's arrest.</p>
        <p>On March 10, she decided to grant a motion filed by the same newspapers to open the trial to the public.</p>
