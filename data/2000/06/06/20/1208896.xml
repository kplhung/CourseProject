        <p>Republican and Democratic leaders in the Legislature announced today that they had reached agreement on legislation that would allow county governments to mandate that people be notified when pesticides were going to be applied near their homes.</p>
        <p>The measure gives the five New York City boroughs and the state's 57 other counties the option of requiring commercial lawn care companies to warn the neighbors of a customer before spraying lawns and shrubs with pesticides. But spraying by individual homeowners would be exempt from the advance-notification requirement.</p>
        <p>The measure was originally sponsored by the Democrats who control the Assembly. But until today, Republican leaders of the Senate had withheld their support for it. Once the two houses pass the measure, it will go to Gov. George E. Pataki, who has not said whether he will sign it into law.</p>
        <p>The bill, which has long been supported by environmental groups that believe pesticide spraying to be a health risk, would require that notice be given to parents 48 hours before spraying at schools and day care centers.</p>
        <p>Proponents of the measure say the warnings would allow people to avoid toxic clouds by shutting windows, covering pools, removing laundry from clotheslines and keeping children and pets indoors while the spraying is taking place.</p>
        <p>But pesticide companies call the measure a burden, saying they have long used safety precautions on their own. The biggest problem with the bill, the critics say, is that it largely exempts the largest category of pesticide users from the advance-notification requirement: individual homeowners, who are untrained and frequently misuse pesticides.</p>
        <p>But Laura Haight, an environmental policy analyst with the New York Public Interest Research Group, said she knew of no other law in the nation like the one New York was considering. She said that a handful of states had registries for people wishing to be notified, but that such notification did not take place automatically.</p>
        <p>''This is a major step forward for people who want to protect themselves and their families from pesticides sprayed in their neighborhoods,'' she said. ''It took a huge effort to get the Senate to the table and make a deal.''</p>
        <p>If a county chose to adopt a notification law, lawn care companies would be required to send a postcard or notice to owners of abutting properties within 150 feet of the area to be treated at least two business days before spraying. Violators could be fined a maximum of $250. Counties could also decide to require individual homeowners to post signs on the days they used pesticides.</p>
        <p>The one provision of the bill that would be mandatory statewide involves schools and day care centers. The bill would require administrators of schools and day care centers to inform parents of any pesticide spraying.</p>
        <p>Administrators of day care centers would have to post notices describing the pesticide and equipment to be used, the name of the applicator, the symptoms of pesticide poisoning and the phone numbers for poison control centers and the regional office of the State Department of Environmental Conservation.</p>
        <p>School administrators would have a little more leeway. They would be required to ask parents if they want to be notified 48 hours before a pesticide application. In addition, the bill would require school administrators to notify parents three times a year about the pesticides used on school grounds.</p>
        <p>The agreement reached today came nearly a week after Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer released a report showing that schools around New York State vastly overuse pesticides and often fail to warn parents, students and school workers when the chemicals are applied.</p>
        <p>The report showed that more than 90 percent of schools statewide use poisons to kill insects, rodents and weeds, but that only about half notify parents or students in advance or post signs indicating that pesticides have been applied.</p>
        <p>The figures were derived from schools' own responses to a survey, and officials in the attorney general's office said the true picture was probably worse, because some schools did not reply to the survey and others probably understated their pesticide use.</p>
