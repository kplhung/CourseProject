        <p>Archbishop Edward M. Egan may have mastered Vatican politics -- at least enough to earn the most visible Catholic post in America -- but now he has to learn the equally intriguing and Machiavellian art of New York politics. First lesson: scan the audience.</p>
        <p>Near the end of his Installation Mass yesterday, the new archbishop greeted Gov. George E. Pataki, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the United States senators from New York and Connecticut but omitted the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was sitting in a front pew.</p>
        <p>A cathedral can be a tough place for an abortion-rights politician like Mrs. Clinton, and Cardinal John J. O'Connor never minced words about his opposition to the issue, so it seemed that the new archbishop, too, might have been making a political point.</p>
        <p>Not so, said Joseph Zwilling, the spokesman for the archdiocese. ''It was an oversight,'' he said. ''He tried to mention as many people as he could recall.''</p>
        <p>At least the oversight was impartial: the archbishop also did not mention Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island, who is Mrs. Clinton's opponent in the Senate race.</p>
        <p>Archbishop Egan seemed to be reading names from a list of expected guests. He greeted the ''Supreme Court justices'' because two had been expected, but only one, Justice Antonin Scalia, actually attended.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton attended the Mass in her capacity as first lady, not as a candidate, said Ilissa Muscatine, a spokeswoman for the first lady's office. ''I think that she would certainly accept his explanation,'' Ms. Muscatine said of the archbishop's oversight.</p>
        <p>It was unclear in what capacity Mrs. Clinton was operating when she remained in the cathedral for about 25 minutes after the Mass, to shake hands with potential voters.</p>
        <p>The City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, who is both a devoted Catholic and a devoted politician, said it would take time for the archbishop to adjust. ''He really has to get his sea legs,'' Mr. Vallone said, adding that comparisons to the late cardinal were unfair.</p>
        <p>''You have to understand O'Connor,'' Mr. Vallone said. ''I never met anyone like him. He recognized everybody. He knew everyone.''</p>
        <p>A NEW ARCHBISHOP: THE SCENE  Correction:  June 24, 2000, Saturday  An article on Tuesday about the installation of Archbishop Edward M. Egan of New York misstated the given name of a spokeswoman for Hillary Rodham Clinton, who explained that Mrs. Clinton had attended the ceremony in her role as first lady, not as a Senate candidate. She is Lissa Muscatine, not Ilissa.</p>
