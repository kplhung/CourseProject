        <p>Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's decision today that public school districts may not allow students to lead organized prayer before football games. The vote in the case, Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, was 6 to 3. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion and was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the dissent and was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.</p>

        <p>Prior to 1995, the Santa Fe High School student who occupied the school's elective office of student council chaplain delivered a prayer over the public address system before each varsity football game. . . .

        <p>Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's decision today that public school districts may not allow students to lead organized prayer before football games. The vote in the case, Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, was 6 to 3. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion and was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the dissent and was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.</p>
        <p>FROM THE DECISION: By Justice Stevens</p>
        <p>Prior to 1995, the Santa Fe High School student who occupied the school's elective office of student council chaplain delivered a prayer over the public address system before each varsity football game. . . . This practice, along with others, was challenged in District Court as a violation of the establishment clause of the First Amendment. While these proceedings were pending in the District Court, the school district adopted a different policy that permits, but does not require, prayer initiated and led by a student at all home games. The District Court entered an order modifying that policy to permit only nonsectarian, nonproselytizing prayer. The Court of Appeals held that, even as modified by the District Court, the football prayer policy was invalid. . . .</p>
        <p>On May 10, 1995, the District Court entered an interim order addressing a number of different issues. . . . With respect to the impending graduation, the order provided that ''nondenominational prayer'' consisting of ''an invocation and/or benediction'' could be presented by a senior student or students selected by members of the graduating class. The text of the prayer was to be determined by the students, without scrutiny or preapproval by school officials. References to particular religious figures ''such as Muhammad, Jesus, Buddha or the like'' would be permitted ''as long as the general thrust of the prayer is nonproselytizing.'' . . . In response to that portion of the order, the district adopted a series of policies over several months dealing with prayer at school functions. The policies enacted in May and July for graduation ceremonies provided the format for the August and October policies for football games. The May policy provided:</p>
        <p>''The board has chosen to permit the graduating senior class, with the advice and counsel of the senior class principal or designee, to elect by secret ballot to choose whether an invocation and benediction shall be part of the graduation exercise. If so chosen, the class shall elect by secret ballot, from a list of student volunteers, students to deliver nonsectarian, nonproselytizing invocations and benedictions for the purpose of solemnizing their graduation ceremonies.'' . . .</p>
        <p>The parties stipulated that after this policy was adopted, ''the senior class held an election to determine whether to have an invocation and benediction at the commencement [and that the] class voted, by secret ballot, to include prayer at the high school graduation.'' . . . In a second vote the class elected two seniors to deliver the invocation and benediction. . . .</p>
        <p>In July, the district enacted another policy eliminating the requirement that invocations and benedictions be ''nonsectarian and nonproselytizing,'' but also providing that if the district were to be enjoined from enforcing that policy, the May policy would automatically become effective.</p>
        <p>The August policy, which was titled ''Prayer at Football Games,'' was similar to the July policy for graduations. It also authorized two student elections, the first to determine whether ''invocations'' should be delivered, and the second to select the spokesperson to deliver them. Like the July policy, it contained two parts, an initial statement that omitted any requirement that the content of the invocation be ''nonsectarian and nonproselytizing,'' and a fallback provision that automatically added that limitation if the preferred policy should be enjoined. On Aug. 31, 1995, according to the parties' stipulation, ''the district's high school students voted to determine whether a student would deliver prayer at varsity football games. . . . The final policy (October policy) is essentially the same as the August policy, though it omits the word ''prayer'' from its title, and refers to ''messages'' and ''statements'' as well as ''invocations.'' It is the validity of that policy that is before us. . . .</p>
        <p>We granted the district's petition for certiorari, limited to the following question: ''Whether petitioner's policy permitting student-led, student-initiated prayer at football games violates the establishment clause.'' We conclude, as did the Court of Appeals, that it does.</p>
        <p>The first clause in the First Amendment to the federal Constitution provides that ''Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''  . . . In Lee v. Weisman, (1992), we held that a prayer delivered by a rabbi at a middle school graduation ceremony violated that clause. Although this case involves student prayer at a different type of school function, our analysis is properly guided by the principles that we endorsed in Lee.</p>
        <p>As we held in that case:</p>
        <p>''The principle that government may accommodate the free exercise of religion does not supersede the fundamental limitations imposed by the establishment clause. It is beyond dispute that, at a minimum, the Constitution guarantees that government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise, or otherwise act in a way which establishes a [state] religion or religious faith, or tends to do so.'' . . .</p>
        <p>Granting only one student access to the stage at a time does not, of course, necessarily preclude a finding that a school has created a limited public forum. Here, however, Santa Fe's student election system ensures that only those messages deemed ''appropriate'' under the district's policy may be delivered. . . .</p>
        <p>In Lee, the school district made the related argument that its policy of endorsing only ''civic or nonsectarian'' prayer was acceptable because it minimized the intrusion on the audience as a whole. We rejected that claim by explaining that such a majoritarian policy ''does not lessen the offense or isolation to the objectors. At best it narrows their number; at worst increases their sense of isolation and affront.'' Similarly, while Santa Fe's majoritarian election might ensure that most of the students are represented, it does nothing to protect the minority; indeed, it likely serves to intensify their offense.</p>
        <p>In addition to involving the school in the selection of the speaker, the policy, by its terms, invites and encourages religious messages. The policy itself states that the purpose of the message is ''to solemnize the event.'' A religious message is the most obvious method of solemnizing an event. Moreover, the requirements that the message ''promote good citizenship'' and ''establish the appropriate environment for competition'' further narrow the types of message deemed appropriate, suggesting that a solemn, yet nonreligious, message, such as commentary on United States foreign policy, would be prohibited. . . . Indeed, the only type of message that is expressly endorsed in the text is an ''invocation'' a term that primarily describes an appeal for divine assistance. . . .</p>
        <p>We recognize the important role that public worship plays in many communities, as well as the sincere desire to include public prayer as a part of various occasions so as to mark those occasions' significance. But such religious activity in public schools, as elsewhere, must comport with the First Amendment.</p>
        <p>The actual or perceived endorsement of the message, moreover, is established by factors beyond just the text of the policy. Once the student speaker is selected and the message composed, the invocation is then delivered to a large audience assembled as part of a regularly scheduled, school-sponsored function conducted on school property. . . .</p>
        <p>In this context the members of the listening audience must perceive the pregame message as a public expression of the views of the majority of the student body delivered with the approval of the school administration. . . .</p>
        <p>Regardless of whether one considers a sporting event an appropriate occasion for solemnity, the use of an invocation to foster such solemnity is impermissible when, in actuality, it constitutes prayer sponsored by the school. And it is unclear what type of message would be both appropriately ''solemnizing'' under the district's policy and yet nonreligious.</p>
        <p>Most striking to us is the evolution of the current policy from the long-sanctioned office of ''Student Chaplain'' to the candidly titled ''Prayer at Football Games'' regulation. This history indicates that the district intended to preserve the practice of prayer before football games. . . .</p>
        <p>The district next argues that its football policy is distinguishable from the graduation prayer in Lee because it does not coerce students to participate in religious observances. Its argument has two parts: first, that there is no impermissible government coercion because the pregame messages are the product of student choices; and second, that there is really no coercion at all because attendance at an extracurricular event, unlike a graduation ceremony, is voluntary.</p>
        <p>The reasons just discussed explaining why the alleged ''circuit-breaker'' mechanism of the dual elections and student speaker do not turn public speech into private speech also demonstrate why these mechanisms do not insulate the school from the coercive element of the final message. In fact, this aspect of the district's argument exposes anew the concerns that are created by the majoritarian election system. The parties' stipulation clearly states that the issue resolved in the first election was ''whether a student would deliver prayer at varsity football games,'' and the controversy in this case demonstrates that the views of the students are not unanimous on that issue.</p>
        <p>One of the purposes served by the establishment clause is to remove debate over this kind of issue from governmental supervision or control. We explained in Lee that the ''preservation and transmission of religious beliefs and worship is a responsibility and a choice committed to the private sphere.'' The two student elections authorized by the policy, coupled with the debates that presumably must precede each, impermissibly invade that private sphere. The election mechanism, when considered in light of the history in which the policy in question evolved, reflects a device the district put in place that determines whether religious messages will be delivered at home football games. The mechanism encourages divisiveness along religious lines in a public school setting, a result at odds with the establishment clause. . . .</p>
        <p>The district further argues that attendance at the commencement ceremonies at issue in Lee ''differs dramatically'' from attendance at high school football games, which it contends ''are of no more than passing interest to many students'' and are ''decidedly extracurricular,'' thus dissipating any coercion. Attendance at a high school football game, unlike showing up for class, is certainly not required in order to receive a diploma. Moreover, we may assume that the district is correct in arguing that the informal pressure to attend an athletic event is not as strong as a senior's desire to attend her own graduation ceremony.</p>
        <p>There are some students, however, such as cheerleaders, members of the band, and, of course, the team members themselves, for whom seasonal commitments mandate their attendance, sometimes for class credit. The district also minimizes the importance to many students of attending and participating in extracurricular activities as part of a complete educational experience.</p>
        <p>We stressed in Lee the obvious observation that ''adolescents are often susceptible to pressure from their peers towards conformity, and that the influence is strongest in matters of social convention.'' High school home football games are traditional gatherings of a school community; they bring together students and faculty as well as friends and family from years present and past to root for a common cause.</p>
        <p>Undoubtedly, the games are not important to some students, and they voluntarily choose not to attend. For many others, however, the choice between whether to attend these games or to risk facing a personally offensive religious ritual is in no practical sense an easy one. The Constitution, moreover, demands that the school may not force this difficult choice upon these students. . . .</p>
        <p>The district, nevertheless, asks us to pretend that we do not recognize what every Santa Fe High School student understands clearly, that this policy is about prayer. . . . We refuse to turn a blind eye to the context in which this policy arose, and that context quells any doubt that this policy was implemented with the purpose of endorsing school prayer.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the simple enactment of this policy, with the purpose and perception of school endorsement of student prayer, was a constitutional violation. We need not wait for the inevitable to confirm and magnify the constitutional injury.</p>
        <p>FROM THE DISSENT: By Chief Justice Rehnquist</p>
        <p>The court distorts existing precedent to conclude that the school district's student-message program is invalid on its face under the establishment clause. But even more disturbing than its holding is the tone of the court's opinion; it bristles with hostility to all things religious in public life. Neither the holding nor the tone of the opinion is faithful to the meaning of the establishment clause, when it is recalled that George Washington himself, at the request of the very Congress which passed the Bill of Rights, proclaimed a day of ''public thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favors of Almighty God.'' . . .</p>
        <p>We do not learn until late in the court's opinion that respondents in this case challenged the district's student-message program at football games before it had been put into practice. As the court explained in United States v. Salerno, the fact that a policy might ''operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid.'' While there is an exception to this principle in the First Amendment overbreadth context because of our concern that people may refrain from speech out of fear of prosecution, there is no similar justification for establishment clause cases.</p>
        <p>No speech will be ''chilled'' by the existence of a government policy that might unconstitutionally endorse religion over nonreligion. Therefore, the question is not whether the district's policy may be applied in violation of the establishment clause, but whether it inevitably will be.</p>
        <p>The court, venturing into the realm of prophesy, decides that it ''need not wait for the inevitable'' and invalidates the district's policy on its face. . . .</p>
        <p>First, the court misconstrues the nature of the ''majoritarian election'' permitted by the policy as being an election on ''prayer'' and ''religion.''  . . . The election permitted by the policy is a twofold process whereby students vote first on whether to have a student speaker before football games at all, and second, if the students vote to have such a speaker, on who that speaker will be.  . . . It is conceivable that the election could become one in which student candidates campaign on platforms that focus on whether or not they will pray if elected. It is also conceivable that the election could lead to a Christian prayer before 90 percent of the football games. If, upon implementation, the policy operated in this fashion, we would have a record before us to review whether the policy, as applied, violated the establishment clause or unduly suppressed minority viewpoints. But it is possible that the students might vote not to have a pregame speaker, in which case there would be no threat of a constitutional violation. It is also possible that the election would not focus on prayer, but on public speaking ability or social popularity. And if student campaigning did begin to focus on prayer, the school might decide to implement reasonable campaign restrictions.</p>
        <p>But the court ignores these possibilities by holding that merely granting the student body the power to elect a speaker that may choose to pray, ''regardless of the students' ultimate use of it, is not acceptable.'' The court so holds despite that any speech that may occur as a result of the election process here would be private, not government, speech. The elected student, not the government, would choose what to say. Support for the court's holding cannot be found in any of our cases. And it essentially invalidates all student elections. A newly elected student body president, or even a newly elected prom king or queen, could use opportunities for public speaking to say prayers. Under the court's view, the mere grant of power to the students to vote for such offices, in light of the fear that those elected might publicly pray, violates the establishment clause.</p>
        <p>Second, with respect to the policy's purpose, the court holds that ''the simple enactment of this policy, with the purpose and perception of school endorsement of student prayer, was a constitutional violation.'' But the policy itself has plausible secular purposes: ''To solemnize the event, to promote good sportsmanship and student safety, and to establish the appropriate environment for the competition.'' Where a governmental body ''expresses a plausible secular purpose'' for an enactment, ''courts should generally defer to that stated intent.'' The court grants no deference to and appears openly hostile toward the policy's stated purposes, and wastes no time in concluding that they are a sham. . . .</p>
        <p>The policy at issue here may be applied in an unconstitutional manner, but it will be time enough to invalidate it if that is found to be the case. I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>
