        <p>Calling it the fulfillment of a lifelong dream, a wealthy American money manager has signed on to become the first tourist in space on a trip to the Russian station Mir.</p>
        <p>The money manager, Dennis Tito, a 59-year-old California multimillionaire, said today that a trip into space would satisfy a childhood fantasy and would be worth the price, estimated to be about $20 million.</p>
        <p>''For me, it's a life's dream,'' Mr. Tito said in a telephone conference call from Moscow, where he was undergoing medical and psychological tests to determine whether he could withstand space travel.</p>
        <p>''I had this dream over 40 years ago and at that time, I didn't have a penny to my name,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Money is no longer a constraint, he said.</p>
        <p>''We have one life to live on this earth, and my commitment is to fulfill all of my dreams which are healthy and legitimate,'' Mr. Tito said. ''I am optimistic that I do have the right stuff to make this flight.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tito, who has degrees in aerospace engineering and had worked for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration before becoming an investment analyst, said he wanted to spend part of the flight conducting special photography of Earth using a system he was developing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tito founded Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica, Calif., in the 1970's to apply computer concepts to investment strategy, and the company now manages about $10 billion in assets and is best known for its Wilshire 5000 stock index.</p>
        <p>If all goes well, Mr. Tito could be visiting Mir on a 10-day trip during the first half of next year, said officials of MirCorp, an Amsterdam company that is raising money to operate the aging Russian station.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, MirCorp secured the rights to market the 130-ton space station that the cash-starved Russian government had stopped supporting.</p>
        <p>On Friday, two Russian astronauts returned after a 73-day, MirCorp-financed mission to Mir. The astronauts -- with the help of two cargo flights, also paid for by MirCorp -- repaired air leaks, replaced deteriorating batteries and revitalized the station's life support systems.</p>
        <p>''The renovated Mir has now been declared ready for commercial flights,'' said Dr. Chirinjeev Kathuria, a MirCorp director and telecommunications entrepreneur who is an investor.</p>
        <p>MirCorp has raised about $100 million to support Mir, including more than $40 million in cash. RSC Energia, the Russian company that built and operates Mir, has agreed to provide $60 million in goods and service, Dr. Kathuria said. RSC owns 60 percent of MirCorp; the remaining 40 percent is owned by American investors.</p>
        <p>MirCorp officials declined to say how much Mr. Tito would pay but acknowledged that it was close to $20 million.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kathuria said the company was talking to at least six others who had expressed interest in the trip.</p>
        <p>MirCorp's president, Jeffrey Manber, speaking from Moscow, said his company's Citizen Explorers program was proceeding cautiously in picking participants who could withstand the rigors of space.</p>
        <p>''This is not a game,'' Mr. Manber said. ''We are cutting no corners here. It is a serious business which requires serious training.''</p>
        <p>MirCorp officials said a public stock offering was expected early next year.</p>
        <p>Several potential ventures, including television programming, advertising and promotion from space, and Internet activities, also are being discussed, officials said. Plans include opening Mir to manufacturing and possibly using the station as a base for assembling and launching satellites.</p>
        <p>Mr. Manber said the company would soon establish a schedule of flights, including a timetable for Mr. Tito's trip. To keep Mir operating, he said, the company would need to send at least one unmanned supply flight in the fall.</p>
