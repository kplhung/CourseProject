      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Jazz and tango have parallel histories. Both came out of the slums and the underworld, were denounced as salacious and were then embraced as dance music. Both moved from clubs to concert halls, evolving into more ambitious forms. Both conjure romance, exhilaration and tension;  both use improvisation. Yet they are as different as Argentina and the United States. Tango has a European formality and a sense of tragedy; jazz prefers openness and a sense of humor, the underlying optimism that lets the blues transcend hard times. Still, it was inevitable that jazz and tango would meet, as they did in the jazz festival concert on Saturday night at Carnegie Hall.</p>
        <p>The concert centered on the music of Astor Piazzolla, the architect of tango nuevo, who brought the polyphony, dissonance and large-scale structures of classical music into tango. With multiple themes, his pieces move between public and private spheres, between modern urban bustle and intimate trysts; cerebral constructions give way to yearning melody. Pablo Ziegler, the longtime pianist in Mr. Piazzolla's quintet, led his own Quintet for the New Tango on Saturday, playing Piazzolla compositions and his own pieces.</p>

        <p>Jazz and tango have parallel histories. Both came out of the slums and the underworld, were denounced as salacious and were then embraced as dance music. Both moved from clubs to concert halls, evolving into more ambitious forms. Both conjure romance, exhilaration and tension;  both use improvisation. Yet they are as different as Argentina and the United States. Tango has a European formality and a sense of tragedy; jazz prefers openness and a sense of humor, the underlying optimism that lets the blues transcend hard times. Still, it was inevitable that jazz and tango would meet, as they did in the jazz festival concert on Saturday night at Carnegie Hall.</p>
        <p>The concert centered on the music of Astor Piazzolla, the architect of tango nuevo, who brought the polyphony, dissonance and large-scale structures of classical music into tango. With multiple themes, his pieces move between public and private spheres, between modern urban bustle and intimate trysts; cerebral constructions give way to yearning melody. Pablo Ziegler, the longtime pianist in Mr. Piazzolla's quintet, led his own Quintet for the New Tango on Saturday, playing Piazzolla compositions and his own pieces.</p>
        <p>He has altered Mr. Piazzolla's lineup, pushing it closer to a jazz quintet by using electric rather than acoustic guitar and drums instead of a violin. Where Mr. Piazzolla's versions of his pieces had the clenched-teeth intensity of a Bartok string quartet, Mr. Ziegler opens them up to improvisation, with his own Romantic flourishes on piano, Hector del Curto's curlicued ornaments on bandoneon (tango accordion) and Claudio Ragazzi's jazzy runs on guitar. The music becomes less stormy and profound than the Piazzolla versions, still moody but more focused on its own intricacies.</p>
        <p>Guest jazz soloists joined Mr. Ziegler's quintet, sandwiched into the arrangements with brief passages of improvisation. Gary Burton on vibraharp brought out the music's thoughtful lucidity; Joe Lovano, on tenor saxophone, found its sultriness and languor, with phrases like wisps of pillow talk. Paquito d'Rivera, playing clarinet and alto saxophone, evoked laughter and blues connections from its restless mobility.</p>
        <p>Pablo Aslan, the bassist in Mr. Ziegler's quintet, led his own New York Tango Quartet in older-style salon tangos, accompanying four dancers: Carolina Zokalski, Diego Di Falco, Corina De LaRosa and Julio Balmaceda. The quartet also accompanied the singer Julia Zenko in excerpts from Mr. Piazzolla's 1968 opera, ''Maria de Buenos Aires.'' With a throaty voice full of nostalgia and determination, she sang about the city, home of the tango, as a place suffused with suffering and dreams.</p>
