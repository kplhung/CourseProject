        <p>PLOWING THE DARK  By Richard Powers  415 pages. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $25.</p>
        <p>The two protagonists of Richard Powers's new novel, ''Plowing the Dark,'' each spend their days in empty rooms, living through their imaginations. These two characters never meet each other; their stories never converge. The first, a woman named Adie, is an artist who is helping to construct a virtual-reality chamber in Seattle in the late 1980's; the second is an American hostage in Lebanon, a man named Tai Martin, who passes his days in captivity trying to reimagine his former life.</p>
        <p>The experiences of these two characters form the armature of Mr. Powers's highly schematic novel of ideas, a static if often provocative book that reads like a series of essays with a couple of glittering fictional set pieces tossed in to grab the reader's attention.</p>
        <p>The central theme of ''Plowing'' is the human urge to recreate the world, be it through the imaginative transactions of art, the generative miracles of science or the grinding gears of memory. This rage to simulate reality comes, Mr. Powers suggests, from our desire to control our environment, somehow to subdue the random terrors of the world. It's the old utopian dream of creating a world obedient to our will, a world where ''all countries move steadily toward democratic free markets,'' where ''zealots, on the road to some mass persecution, fall down blind and rise ecumenical,'' where ''criminals come across life-changing novels in prison,'' where ''each day ends in some illustrative sunset, shattering or subtle.''</p>
        <p>The utopian undertaking in which Adie is involved concerns the construction of the Cavern, a ''second-generation, experimental, total-immersion environment modeler'' for a huge Seattle-based high-tech company that sounds a bit like Microsoft. The Cavern is a sort of postmodern version of Plato's cave: a room that will transport visitors to virtual realms where they will be bewitched and bedazzled by a magical shadow show made up of ''a few trillion bits of math.''</p>
        <p>There's a theme-park feel to the Cavern: it's part World's Fair exhibit, part Disneyland, but with a messianic gloss. Its creators see it as a stepping stone on the way to a digital future in which transistors will be implanted in the human brain and ''belief-quality graphics'' will adorn the living room walls of every middle-class home.</p>
        <p>While Adie doesn't really buy into her colleagues' faith in a high-tech future, much less understand the tools of their craft, she does see the Cavern as a wonderful plaything, a new medium in which to work her gifts as an artist. She designs one virtual realm modeled on a Rousseau painting, a jungly room with monkeys and snakes and palmy trees; another is modeled on van Gogh's painting of his room in Arles, its tilted floorboards and walls all meticulously reproduced through the alchemy of algorithms and computer code.</p>
        <p>As he did in his 1995 novel ''Galatea 2.2,'' Mr. Powers uses his interest in technology to raise a host of questions, in this case questions about the relationship between reality and illusion, science and art, truth and perception. While these questions are initially engaging, he natters on about them at tiresome length, to the point where cerebral speculation overwhelms the story of Adie and her colleagues.</p>
        <p>There is so much talk about the Cavern and how it works and what it means that Adie's nonvirtual encounters -- her affair with an old friend and fellow worker named Steve and their visit to an ailing college friend in Ohio -- begin to feel like hasty afterthoughts grafted on to a philosophical treatise. Matters are not helped by Mr. Powers's portentous references to the momentous changes taking place in the world beyond the Cavern: Tiananmen Square, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the beginnings of the Persian Gulf war.</p>
        <p>As for the second story line in ''Plowing the Dark,'' the story concerning the kidnapping and imprisonment of Tai Martin by terrorists in Lebanon, it reprises many of the themes of Adie's tale. But while Adie and her Cavern friends rely upon technology to midwife their visions, Tai has nothing but his own imagination to wallpaper the drab walls of his cell. As his weeks in captivity stretch into months, he tries to pass the time by rerunning novels like ''Great Expectations'' in his head, and trying to reconstitute his former life with mosaic shards of memory and dreams.</p>
        <p>Mr. Powers does a persuasive job of conveying the terror, loneliness and wasting boredom that Tai faces day after day: the appearance of a mouse in his grungy cell thrills him with the prospect of making a connection to another living creature; the tapping on the wall from a prisoner in another cell gives him hope that gives way to despair when the tapping abruptly stops.</p>
        <p>That Tai's story has far more emotional resonance than Adie's, however, has less to do with the traumatic nature of his adventures than with Mr. Powers's restraint in embroidering his story with the sort of lugubrious philosophizing that weighs down the other portions of this novel. Both stories illuminate the author's thesis about the powers of the human imagination, but Adie's tale, which makes up the bulk of this novel, remains a clumsy, paint-by-numbers illustration, an illustration that, oddly enough, lacks the requisite imagination to become a persuasive fiction.</p>
