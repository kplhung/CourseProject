        <p>Rafael Bermudez, a tourist from Colombia, did not have a ticket to get into St. Patrick's Cathedral for Archbishop Egan's Mass of Installation. He made up for it by snagging the best vantage point he could outside, positioning himself under the Fifth Avenue reviewing stand used by television cameras to capture the procession of clergymen into the cathedral.</p>
        <p>''I think this is spectacular -- look at all those priests,'' Mr. Bermudez, 73, said, peering out from under the stand as white-robed priests filed past the cathedral's great bronze doors. ''I don't know how many are coming, but it must be thousands. When you have this kind of procession, this just reinforces your Catholic faith.''</p>

        <p>Rafael Bermudez, a tourist from Colombia, did not have a ticket to get into St. Patrick's Cathedral for Archbishop Egan's Mass of Installation. He made up for it by snagging the best vantage point he could outside, positioning himself under the Fifth Avenue reviewing stand used by television cameras to capture the procession of clergymen into the cathedral.</p>
        <p>''I think this is spectacular -- look at all those priests,'' Mr. Bermudez, 73, said, peering out from under the stand as white-robed priests filed past the cathedral's great bronze doors. ''I don't know how many are coming, but it must be thousands. When you have this kind of procession, this just reinforces your Catholic faith.''</p>
        <p>It was not an ideal place to watch church history unfold. There were bus fumes and honking cabs and sharp elbows and stern-looking police officers. But hundreds who were not fortunate enough to be among the 4,000 invited guests inside were not too discouraged to wait outside.</p>
        <p>Many arrived early, finding choice spots behind police barricades where they could watch the pageantry that marked the beginning of the service. There they remained, straining through the din of heavy traffic to listen to the service, which was broadcast through loudspeakers affixed to the church. Others watched the two-hour service on eight televisions set up across 50th Street from the church.</p>
        <p>Some people, like Mary Nolan, a Catholic from Queens, made it a point to be outside the cathedral, because, as she said, ''I needed to be a part of it.'' Others, like Jim White, a tourist from Portland, Ore., was simply strolling on Fifth Avenue with his three grandsons when he saw the unfolding drama and began to capture it with his camcorder.</p>
        <p>Juan Mendez, 54, a cook at the Saks Fifth Avenue cafe, positioned himself in front of one of the televisions outside the cathedral as soon as he finished work at 3 p.m. ''It's a beautiful thing,'' he said. ''You have to be a Catholic to feel this in your heart. If you're not a Catholic, you can't feel it.''</p>
        <p>A few lucky souls even got to shake the archbishop's hand as he walked outside after Mass.</p>
        <p>''I actually shook his hand; I got blessed,'' said Vito Errico, 34, a Connecticut resident who was visiting New York with his wife, Anna. ''It's amazing. I feel so Catholic today.''</p>
