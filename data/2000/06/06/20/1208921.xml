        <p>A federal appeals court stepped forcefully into the Microsoft antitrust case today, dismissing a government argument that it lacked jurisdiction and setting a fast-paced schedule for reviewing Microsoft's request that the judges block a lower-court order restricting its conduct.</p>
        <p>Microsoft applauded the decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, saying, ''Obviously, we are pleased that the appeals court unanimously sided with Microsoft and rejected the government's position.''</p>
        <p>But it will probably prove to be a Pyrrhic victory. The last paragraph of the two-page order says that if the trial judge asks the Supreme Court to take the case directly, ''this briefing schedule will be automatically suspended.''</p>
        <p>That request could come as soon as Tuesday, and as a result the government also proclaimed victory. ''We are very pleased with the court's ruling that it would stay further proceedings if the district court certifies the case for direct appeal to the Supreme Court,'' said Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general are trying to send the case directly to the Supreme Court under a little-used law known as the Expediting Act. It allows the direct appeal of significant federal antitrust cases. Microsoft wants its appeal heard in the court of appeals, which has sided with the company in the past.</p>
        <p>Moving quickly last week, before the judge could send the case to the Supreme Court, Microsoft tried to outmaneuver the government by asking the appeals court to consider its request to stay the judge's order. And the appeals court showed that it was eager to take the case by declaring that the entire court, not a three-judge panel, would hear the stay request and larger appeal.</p>
        <p>In reaction, the government argued in a brief that the appeals court does not have jurisdiction, on several grounds -- arguments that the court dismissed today. The court set a schedule under which Microsoft and the government will have only until July 6 to file briefs on Microsoft's request to stay the court-ordered remedy, unless the schedule is suspended.</p>
        <p>But the court order today also indicated another victory for the government in the legal skirmishes that the two sides have fought since Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his order on June 7 breaking Microsoft in two and forcing the company to abide by a long list of restrictions while the breakup is carried out.</p>
        <p>Microsoft had argued, in an appeals court brief last week, that the Expediting Act does not apply to the states' lawsuit since it applies only to federal cases.</p>
        <p>But the Justice Department countered that since the suits were tried together, and since only single rulings and remedies were entered for the two suits, the appeals of both should be carried together to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Today the appeals court indicated that it agreed with the government. The court's order says it will suspend consideration of the appeal of the states' case, too, as soon as Judge Jackson issues the certification to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Separately, Microsoft filed with Judge Jackson a brief setting out the company's arguments against a direct appeal. High on the list of objections was the argument about the states' case, even though hours earlier the appeals court had indicated it did not accept that argument.</p>
        <p>But Microsoft also hit on the one argument that is most likely to concern the Supreme Court justices, the need to read several thousand pages of trial record in a direct appeal. Usually, the appeals court winnows that trial record for Supreme Court review so the justices may have to read only summaries.</p>
        <p>But Microsoft promised that ''the sheer number of factual and legal issues raised by Microsoft's appeals, as well as a range of important procedural issues,'' make it ''completely unsuitable for summary disposition.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft noted that addressing all of the issues to be raised in the appeal ''would require review of the 13,466-page trial transcript and the 2,695 trial exhibits that comprise the record in these cases, a time-consuming exercise the Supreme Court would not likely be anxious to undertake.''</p>
        <p>The company also tried to argue that the case was not important enough to warrant direct review, even though in a previous brief Microsoft said the remedy imposed on the company ''could have a significant adverse impact on the nation's economy.''</p>
        <p>Today Microsoft quoted the text of the Expediting Act, which said cases of ''general public importance'' to the ''administration of justice'' are eligible for direct review. The company took that language about the administration of justice literally and stated that the Microsoft appeal would not impair the government's ''ongoing enforcement responsibilities.''</p>
        <p>And to the appeals court of Appeals statement last week that the case was ''of exceptional importance,'' Microsoft said that view ''makes it more important, not less, that the case proceed through intermediate appellate review.''</p>
        <p>The Justice Department may choose to file a reply to Microsoft's brief on Tuesday. But it is also possible that Judge Jackson will simply issue the certification order on Tuesday. He has made it clear for more than two months that he is eager to do that.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court does not have to take the appeal, in which case it would be sent back to the Court of Appeals. No one knows whether the Supreme Court will decide quickly, since it is near the end of the court's term -- or wait until its next term, which begins in October.</p>
