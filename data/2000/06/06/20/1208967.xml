        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Sounds of Silencing,'' by Frank Rich (column, June 17):</p>
        <p>Censorship refers to the government's forcible suppression of speech.  But when a private citizen refuses to listen to or support the views of those with whom he disagrees, he is merely exercising his right of freedom of association. And he leaves others' freedom of expression intact.</p>
        <p>Free speech does not guarantee an audience and does not include the right to force other people to listen to what one has to say. Thus, those who campaign for withdrawing sponsorship from Dr. Laura Schlessinger, Bruce Springsteen and others are not attacking anyone's right to say what he wishes; they are simply urging people to withdraw support from what they regard as objectionable content. The greatest champion of free speech can consistently join in such campaigns.</p>

        <p>The writer is an associate professor of philosophy, University of Texas.</p>
