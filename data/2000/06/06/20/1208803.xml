        <p>Young women dashing about, say, the lacrosse field and then swilling soda to celebrate victory seems like the kind of image commonly seen in television commercials. But a new study adds a jarring note to this scene.</p>
        <p>Those girls have a much higher chance of suffering a fractured bone, especially if their soda of choice is cola, Harvard researchers say.</p>
        <p>Dr. Grace Wyshak, a professor at the School of Public Health, reports that active girls who drink cola are five times as likely to have fractures as are girls who do not drink any soda. The study appears in this month's Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, and was based on interviews of 460 9th and 10th graders.</p>
        <p>According to Professor Wyshak, the study confirmed earlier research that found a link between bone fractures in physically active people and cola.</p>
        <p>Some doctors believe that the phosphoric acid in cola drinks is to blame, because it may affect calcium metabolism and bone mass.</p>
        <p>Others cite dietary preferences, with cola replacing the milk that young people need to develop strong bones.</p>
