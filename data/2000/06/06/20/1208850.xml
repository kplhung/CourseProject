        <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art, which abruptly canceled a Coco Chanel retrospective last month, has decided on a replacement for its grand, annual exhibition: the White House fashions of Jacqueline Kennedy. The show, along with its opening night gala to benefit the Met's Costume Institute, has been pushed back from December to spring 2001, and so for the first time in 51 years the splashy fund-raiser sometimes known as ''the party of the year'' will take place not during the winter social season, but amid the spring one, on April 23.</p>
        <p>The Met backed out of a Chanel show last month after Karl Lagerfeld, the label's designer, and Met officials disagreed over how expansive Mr. Lagerfeld's role as curator would be. It had been Mr. Lagerfeld's ambition to show the work of artists like Jenny Holzer alongside the legendary suits and cocktail dresses.</p>
        <p>''Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years'' is unlikely to spark any similarly unconventional bursts of inspiration among those who assemble it. Fashion insiders said they thought the choice was a crowd-pleasing, humdrum one.</p>
        <p>The exhibition will focus on what Mrs. Kennedy referred to as her state clothes, including the fawn coat and pillbox hat she wore for President John F. Kennedy's inauguration on Jan. 20, 1961; the Givenchy coat and dress she wore on an official visit to Versailles, France; and outfits for a visit to India and Pakistan. The 80 pieces will come from the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston. The curator, Hamish Bowles, who is Vogue's European editor at large, has been spending his recent days there.</p>
        <p>The Library has 65 to 70 outfits. Nearly all will be in the exhibition, said Mr. Bowles, a collector and connoisseur of vintage couture. He will cull the additional items from the archive's stable of Mrs. Kennedy's accessories.</p>
        <p>Harold Holzer, director of communications at the Met, said it was not the sudden change of program that caused the show to be rescheduled. Nor is it the need to replace Chanel's promised $1.5 million in underwriting for the show and gala. ''Money is not the issue,'' Mr. Holzer said. ''It's when we could do it in terms of getting out a catalog concurrent with the show.'' The show will be held not in the underground Costume Institute but upstairs in the museum's Cantor Galleries.</p>
        <p>When rumors of a Kennedy show began a few weeks ago, a representative from Courreges, a favorite label of Mrs. Kennedy, called the Met to discuss possible sponsorship. So far, the call has not been answered, the representative said. Mr. Holzer said, ''The Met's first priority was cementing an agreement for the show.''</p>
        <p>Last week, the Met named the fashion historian Harold Koda as the head of its Costume Institute, replacing Richard Martin, who died last year. Mr. Koda is unable to work on the Kennedy show right away, however, because he is assembling an exhibition of Giorgio Armani's work for the Guggenheim Museum in the fall.</p>
        <p>A show devoted to Mrs. Kennedy's White House style had been discussed at the Met for some time. ''This is something the museum had been hoping to do for a good number of years,'' Mr. Holzer said. ''It is not a light bulb that went off two weeks ago.'' A similar show had been planned by the Corcoran Gallery in Washington but was scotched, a representative of the Corcoran said, when the Kennedy family said that it would prefer such an exhibition to take place at the Met, an institution with which Mrs. Kennedy enjoyed strong ties. Her daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, will be honorary chairwoman of the gala.</p>
        <p>Some in the fashion world were disappointed at the Met's decision to honor a style on which few who have ever picked up a copy of Vogue need further schooling. ''Clearly it sounds like a big commercial thing,'' said Lisa Eisner, the stylist and vintage collector. ''Don't Elvis and Marilyn sell as much as Jackie?'' she asked. ''Why don't they just do all three?''</p>
        <p>Marin Hopper, the fashion director of Elle magazine, said, ''It will be interesting to see what will be brought to a theme and style that's been very played out over the years.''</p>
        <p>But Valerie Steele, curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology said she had few issues with a show highlighting Mrs. Kennedy's look. ''I don't have a problem with the concept,'' she explained. ''Maybe it's not the most scholarly show in the world, but her fashion was covered in headlines. In fashion, we tend to focus on the influence of designers. But trendsetters have just as much impact on history.''</p>
