        <p>After four weeks of technical and often intimate testimony about the life and finances of Albert J. Pirro Jr., a jury began deliberating late this afternoon whether to convict Mr. Pirro of federal tax-fraud charges.</p>

        <p>After four weeks of technical and often intimate testimony about the life and finances of Albert J. Pirro Jr., a jury began deliberating late this afternoon whether to convict Mr. Pirro of federal tax-fraud charges.</p>
        <p>There was no verdict by day's end. In fact, the jury of eight men and four women met for only an hour, then announced that they had chosen a foreman. Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr. then granted their request to return Tuesday at 9 a.m. to the federal district courthouse here.</p>
        <p>When they do so, they will dig into a high-profile case in which Mr. Pirro, the husband of Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, and his brother and accountant, Anthony G. Pirro, are accused of improperly deducting $1.2 million in Albert Pirro's personal expenses as business expenditures. The deductions, the government has charged, resulted in a reduction of Albert Pirro's taxes by $413,000 in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Pirro has not been charged with any wrongdoing. But her name has come up frequently in testimony, and not without insinuation, as contractors who sold cars, painted murals, built cabinetry and performed other personal tasks but were paid by Albert Pirro's companies have offered a near-virtual tour of her house and a voyeuristic audit of her family's spending habits.</p>
        <p>The trial has also provided its share of twists and awkward moments. The most recent incident unfolded Thursday, when the prosecution compared Albert Pirro, a successful lawyer and Republican fund-raiser, to Richard Nixon, saying that both were ''smart people'' who ''keep very damaging information around.''</p>
        <p>Defense lawyers immediately demanded a mistrial, saying the analogy was full of innuendo about bribery and obstruction of justice.</p>
        <p>But that motion was apparently denied by Judge Parker this morning in a two-hour closed-conference meeting, because things went according to plan, if only a bit slower than anticipated. Still, by early afternoon, Judge Parker began explaining the law and parameters of the 61 counts of conspiracy and tax evasion facing the two brothers.</p>
        <p>In all, the instructions took two hours. And Judge Parker was careful to remind jurors that the evidence -- and only the evidence contained in thousands and thousands of documents and dozens of witnesses -- should be considered, and not the eloquence or personalities of the lawyers or the defendants.</p>
        <p>Throughout the day, when the jury was not present, Mr. Pirro was his usual affable self, schmoozing with reporters, friends who have attended the trial, and even Agent John Dennehy of the Internal Revenue Service, who had been the government's main witness in the case.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Pirro stayed for most of the day, and later told reporters outside that she was confident that husband would be vindicated.</p>
        <p>''They'll find justice,'' she said. ''They'll find truth.''</p>
