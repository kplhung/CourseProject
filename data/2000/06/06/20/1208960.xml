        <p>''One well-placed bomb could set back the church of the United States many, many years right now,'' one priest said to two others as they ambled out of the Palace Hotel, part of a long line of priests, bishops, Knights of Columbus and Dames of Malta.</p>

        <p>''One well-placed bomb could set back the church of the United States many, many years right now,'' one priest said to two others as they ambled out of the Palace Hotel, part of a long line of priests, bishops, Knights of Columbus and Dames of Malta.</p>
        <p>The procession stretched from St. Patrick's Cathedral across the street to the hotel plaza and up the stairs of its lobby, to a banquet room where about 1,000 priests and 100 bishops had put on their vestments, just as they had done for Cardinal O'Connor's funeral five weeks earlier.</p>
        <p>''But it's now a very happy occasion,'' said Father Frank Bassett of the Church of St. John the Evangelist in Goshen, N.Y. ''It's a new bishop, a new start, and people are here for a celebration.''</p>
        <p>This time, the heavy security of the funeral was replaced by a new sentinel: Lady Cowdiva, a shapely cow riding another cow, and clothed only in a cloak of golden hair. One of the city's temporary cow sculptures, she watched from in front of the hotel, inciting snickers among the men of the cloth.</p>
        <p>The procession lasted more than half an hour. A thurifer, who holds the censer containing burning frankincense, led what Ian Dowding said was 1,500 to 2,000 participants. Mr. Dowding said his title for the day was ''priest herder.''</p>
        <p>As the line rounded the church on the north side, it was joined by six cardinals. Two other cardinals, William Baum, the major penitentiary of Vatican City, and James Hickey, the archbishop of Washington, opted out of the procession and were waiting in the sanctuary when the marchers arrived.</p>
        <p>Archbishop Egan and Archbishop Gabriel Montalvo, the Vatican's ambassador to the United States, brought up the rear, together with an altar boy bearing the archbishop's crosier, or shepherd's crook. As they entered, the cathedral erupted in applause. Behind them, a man in a suit tugged at the great bronze door, and after a moment, it swung shut.</p>

        <p>A NEW ARCHBISHOP: THE SCENE  Correction:  June 23, 2000, Friday  An article on Tuesday about Archbishop Edward M. Egan's Mass of Installation and an article on Sunday about preparations for the ceremony both misstated the route of an outdoor procession in Manhattan. Before walking to St. Patrick's Cathedral for the Mass on Monday, more than 1,000 priests and bishops assembled at the Palace Hotel, behind the cathedral on Madison Avenue, not at the Catholic Center at 56th Street and First Avenue.</p>
