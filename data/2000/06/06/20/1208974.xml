        <p>The Indiana Pacers were not supposed to make it this difficult. Their starting point guard is slow, their top center can't rebound, they were from the second-class Eastern Conference.

        <p>Extending the vaunted Los Angeles Lakers further into the four-of-seven-game series than many thought possible, putting a scare into the team of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant until the final moments of Game 6, befuddling the best defense in the league, the Pacers proved to be valiant warriors in their second-place finish.</p>

        <p>The Indiana Pacers were not supposed to make it this difficult. Their starting point guard is slow, their top center can't rebound, they were from the second-class Eastern Conference. Compassionate observers were hoping that the Pacers would not embarrass themselves in the National Basketball Association finals.</p>
        <p>Extending the vaunted Los Angeles Lakers further into the four-of-seven-game series than many thought possible, putting a scare into the team of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant until the final moments of Game 6, befuddling the best defense in the league, the Pacers proved to be valiant warriors in their second-place finish.</p>
        <p>''What a phenomenal year,'' point guard Mark Jackson said in a sullen Pacers locker room after their 116-111 loss to the Lakers. ''Nobody felt we'd go this far. And here we are standing here talking in the middle of June.''</p>
        <p>Tonight's game marked the end of Larry Bird's tenure in Indiana. Bird, the Hall of Fame player from French Lick, Ind., has said for three years that he will retire after this season. After his players had an outstanding game, he addressed them for the final time as coach.</p>
        <p>''I just thanked them for the last three years,'' Bird said. ''They worked very hard for me, and I just told them that if they work as hard for the next coach as they did for me, they'll have an opportunity to get back here next year. After the finals experience that they've had playing in the finals, I think they know what to expect now.''</p>
        <p>The Pacers, who lost, four games to two, to the Lakers in their first appearance in the N.B.A. finals, exposed all of the champions' warts. With a perimeter-oriented, screen-and-pick offense, they shot better than 46 percent in the final four games and better than 50 percent twice. Only four teams made half their shots against the Lakers, who held opponents to a league-low 41.6 percent shooting, during the 82-game regular season.</p>
        <p>A few bounces here, a few calls there and this could have easily been a seven-game series. Game 4, in which the Pacers lost by 120-118 in overtime, could have gone either way, and tonight a questionable call on Austin Croshere with 1 minute 16 seconds remaining stole a huge opportunity from Indiana. With the Lakers clinging desperately to a 110-109 lead, Dale Davis cleanly blocked a driving shot by Glen Rice. But Croshere was called for what appeared to be a phantom foul, sending Rice to the line. Rice, a great foul shooter, hit both shots.</p>
        <p>''Tough call, tough call,'' Jackson said. ''We've got to live with it but it was a tough call. I'm glad it was on TV so when I talk about it 10 years from now, people will have seen it.''</p>
        <p>Reggie Miller, who followed Jalen Rose's team-best 29 points with 25 points, said playing for Bird was unlike any of his previous experiences.</p>
        <p>''Personally, I was like a kid in a candy store,'' Miller said. ''Larry's a living legend. He was a big-time player, and he showed that he's a big-time coach.''</p>
        <p>The team president, Donnie Walsh, hopes Bird will accept a position in the Pacers' front office. He said Bird disproved the idea that tremendous players could not become great coaches. ''I think he set the standard for ex-players,'' Walsh said. ''He was a coach of the year, an All-Star Game coach, and he took us to the finals. That's about as good as you can do, having never had any coaching experience.''</p>
        <p>When the Pacers return to Indiana, many of the fans will be wondering what their team will look like next year. Indiana has six free agents: Miller, Jackson, Rose, Croshere, Sam Perkins and Rik Smits. Rose will be highly coveted on the free-agent market, Smits and Perkins are likely to retire and the 35-year old Jackson may not be brought back. Perhaps only Miller and Croshere will remain.</p>
        <p>Jackson hopes to be back and said the Pacers, as constructed, could challenge again next year. ''You don't go from being a great team and playing for all the marbles to being chumps,'' he said. ''So there's no question that we can do it again.''</p>
        <p>Like any team that considers itself a champion, the Pacers are not pleased to have just represented themselves well. They left the Staples Center refusing to believe they were the second best team in the N.B.A.</p>
        <p>''We proved a lot of people wrong, but that was not our goal at all,'' Jackson said. ''That doesn't mean anything. We did not come here to prove that we could play with the Lakers. We felt that we were the better team.''</p>
        <p>Not better, but just as worthy of admiration.</p>
