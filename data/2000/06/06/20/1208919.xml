        <p>Clearing the way for a merger that would make Pfizer Inc. the world's biggest pharmaceutical company, the Federal Trade Commission approved its combination with the Warner-Lambert Company yesterday on condition that the companies shed businesses in four categories.</p>
        <p>''The commission's order preserves competition for several very important drugs that treat diseases suffered by millions of Americans annually,'' said Richard G. Parker, director of the agency's Bureau of Competition.</p>
        <p>The $90.2 billion deal, which was announced in early February, attracted consumer as well as government opposition, but it was widely assumed that the companies would eventually propose modifications that would meet the government's objections.</p>
        <p>''This is a defining moment for Pfizer,'' said William C. Steere Jr., chairman of the New York-based drug giant, after the commission's 5-to-0 vote. ''Combining the two fastest-growing companies in the industry creates a global leader in the discovery of health and consumer products.''</p>
        <p>In addition to well-known household products including Listerine, Ben-Gay, Sudafed, Benadryl, Schick, Cortizone and Visine, the deal brings together Warner-Lambert's Lipitor, a cholesterol drug, and Pfizer's Viagra for male impotence.</p>
        <p>The merger is not to be final, however, until after a period for public comment on the proposed consent agreement expires July 19.</p>
        <p>Public Citizen, a watchdog group, complained that the remedies accepted by the commission do little for consumers. ''There's really not a shred of evidence that the public is getting a price break out of the economies of scale,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, a physician who directs the organization's health group. ''This sounds great if you're a stockholder but not if you're a patient.''</p>
        <p>Shares of Pfizer, which had sales of $16.2 billion last year, closed yesterday at $46.9875, down $1.9063. Warner-Lambert, which is based in Morris Plains, N.J., and had $12.9 billion in sales, fell $1.25, to $129.75.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, Warner-Lambert is to end its arrangement with Forest Laboratories to co-promote the antidepressant Celexa; Pfizer will sell its head-lice treatment business to the Bayer Corporation; Warner-Lambert's assets related to the Alzheimer's drug Cognex are to be sold to the First Horizon Pharmaceutical Corporation; and Pfizer will transfer its business under development for treating solid-tumor cancers to OSI Pharmaceuticals.</p>
        <p>Pfizer is to exchange 2.75 shares of its common stock for each share of Warner-Lambert in a transaction that would be tax free. Pfizer, which said it did not expect the sales to significantly diminish its performance, put expected savings from the merger at a minimum $1.6 billion by 2002.</p>
