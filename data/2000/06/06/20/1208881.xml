        <p>For years, Unocal, the California-based international oil company, has been courting criticism by doing business in Myanmar in the face of sanctions imposed on the military leadership there by the Clinton administration and a growing list of state and local governments.</p>
        <p>So while Unocal was not mentioned in today's Supreme Court decision that struck down a Massachusetts law that prohibited companies doing business in Myanmar from receiving state government contracts, the ruling was a significant victory for the oil giant.</p>
        <p>The Myanmar government has been accused of drug trafficking and of numerous labor and human rights abuses.</p>
        <p>It has been the subject of an intense campaign by human rights advocates who have sought to force reforms on the country by putting pressure on Western corporations doing business there.</p>
        <p>Unocal, which holds a 28 percent interest in a natural gas production and pipeline project in Myanmar, is the largest American investor in the country, and has faced lawsuits and protests from human rights advocates and student groups demanding its withdrawal from the project.</p>
        <p>But the company has refused to bow to the criticism.</p>
        <p>In fact, Unocal announced a deal with the Myanmar government to expand its rights to explore and develop gas fields off the nation's coast on the same day in 1997 that the State Department issued a report condemning the killing and torture of dissidents and ethnic minorities in the country.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration has imposed sanctions on Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, banning all new investment.</p>
        <p>Unocal's natural gas project was grandfathered in under the federal sanctions, but the company is prohibited from expanding its investments there.</p>
        <p>Human right advocates had also persuaded a number of local governments, including the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, to pass  laws prohibiting contracts with companies that do business in Myanmar.</p>
        <p>Unocal was in the background of the suit that made its way to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>The case was brought against Massachusetts by a Washington lobbying group called the National Foreign Trade Council. Unocal is one of the group's 550 members, and is represented on the group's 70-member board.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the trade council said the lawsuit was intended to attack a broader problem than simply the protests against Unocal in Myanmar.</p>
        <p>The group initiated the suit to combat the growing trend among state and local governments seeking to influence United States foreign policy through local sanctions.</p>
        <p>Myanmar just happened to be the best test case because a state, in addition to cities and towns, had imposed sanctions against it, said Daniel O'Flaherty, vice president of the foreign trade council. He said that about a half-dozen countries are facing similar locally generated sanctions.</p>
        <p>He acknowledged that Myanmar has ''an unlovely government'' that added to the public relations problems of the suit.</p>
        <p>''Did we think about the P.R. aspects of choosing Burma? -- of course,'' Mr. O'Flaherty said. ''But we were testing the principle of the latitude of subfederal units'' to influence foreign policy.</p>
        <p>''The lawsuit was not about Burma,'' he said. ''It was not a crusade on behalf of Unocal.''</p>
