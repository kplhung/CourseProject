        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In my career as a high school teacher of American history, I required that my students read ''The Jungle,'' the 1906 novel by Upton Sinclair, in preparation for studying the horrible working conditions of Americans in the meatpacking industry at the turn of the century.</p>
        <p>How frightening it was to read ''At a Slaughterhouse, Some Things Never Die'' (''How Race Is Lived in America,'' front page, June 16). Have working conditions really changed at all in the last 100 years, or are workers as exploited now as they were before the growth of the American labor movement?</p>

        <p>It is shameful that we do not extend the wealth of our society to all workers to ensure a decent standard of living for every family.</p>
