        <p>Two components of cancer were not addressed in ''First Battle of Cancer: Deep Denial'' (June 13).</p>
        <p>One is the belief that cancer spreads when you disturb it. We used to believe the best thing you could do for a suspicious lump was to leave it alone. That may have been true generations ago, but with medical advances, it is less true now. Often, chemotherapy or radiotherapy are given before surgery in order to best contain the cancer.</p>
        <p>A second belief, especially in older patients, is the notion that the majority of hospital admissions resulted in death, so best to stay away. Many a diagnostic work-up is postponed or sidestepped to avoid the hospital. However, virtually all diagnostic work-ups are now done on an outpatient basis, not requiring expensive or uncomfortable hospital admission. Denial is certainly a multifaceted obstacle in the battle against cancer.</p>
