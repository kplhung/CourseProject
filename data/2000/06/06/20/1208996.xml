        <p>KABAT-Elvin A. Ph.D. The Faculty and Staff of Columbia University College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons mourn the loss of our distinguished friend and colleague, Dr. Elvin Kabat. Dr. Kabat's long career with Columbia University began as an Assistant Professor of Bacteriology in 1946. An immunochemist, biochemist and educator, he served Columbia for more than half a century, becoming Higgins Professor Emeritus in 1985. One of the founders of the field of immunochemistry, Dr. Kabat received the National Medal of Science, the nation's highest award for scientific achievement, from President Bush in 1991. His accomplishments are illustrated in his vast list of publications, which total more than 400 and have been distributed throughout the world. Dr. Kabat was universally admired and venerated by generations of students, colleagues and staff. He will be greatly missed and his memory cherished. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Sally, and his sons. Thomas Q. Morris, M.D. Interim Dean for Clinical and Educational Affairs, Columbia Univ. College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons David I. Hirsh, PhD, Interim Dean for Research, Columbia University College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons.</p>
