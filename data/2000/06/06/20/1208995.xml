        <p>HOCHBERG-Leonard . It is with great sorrow that the Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Leonard Hochberg, brother of Irwin Hochberg, former chairman of the board and longtime supporter of UJA-Federation and many other Jewish causes. Our deepest sympathies go to Irwin, his wife, Rita, and the rest of the family. May all who benefited from Leonard's kindness and wisdom be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
