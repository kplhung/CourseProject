        <p>Officials in the British government and the English Football Association in charge of England's bid for the 2006 World Cup must be experiencing that sinking feeling right about now.</p>
        <p>The chronic misbehavior of English fans who traveled to the current European Championships in Belgium and the Netherlands could not only cost the English a place in the quarterfinals, but is also likely to deal a death blow to England's chance to play host to the World Cup 40 years after it won its only championship.</p>

        <p>Officials in the British government and the English Football Association in charge of England's bid for the 2006 World Cup must be experiencing that sinking feeling right about now.</p>
        <p>The chronic misbehavior of English fans who traveled to the current European Championships in Belgium and the Netherlands could not only cost the English a place in the quarterfinals, but is also likely to deal a death blow to England's chance to play host to the World Cup 40 years after it won its only championship.</p>
        <p>England plays its final first-round match today, against Romania. A victory would send England to the quarterfinals against Italy, coincidentally, in the stadium in Brussels where 39 fans, mainly Italian, died in 1985 before the European Cup final between Liverpool and Juventus. But officials of UEFA, the sport's European governing body, have threatened to expel the English team from the competition if there are any more hooligan incidents.</p>
        <p>In the midst of the tournament, attention quickly shifted to the 2006 World Cup. FIFA's executive committee will vote on where to play the tournament on July 6 in Zurich. South Africa was the favorite even before Euro 2000.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, this doesn't help the English cause,'' said Chuck Blazer, the executive secretary of the Football Confederation and one of three regional representatives from North and Central America and the Caribbean on FIFA's executive committee. ''I've heard some comments from European members who will vote, and they are indicating that they will be hard pressed to give consideration to England. Those votes could now go to Germany or elsewhere.''</p>
        <p>In contrast to the events in the Low Countries, England played host to the championships in 1996 and experienced no crowd problems. Matters seem to be exacerbated when the English travel abroad to major soccer events.</p>
        <p>''There is the perception that it would be sending the wrong message to reward this kind of behavior with a jewel like the World Cup,'' Blazer said.</p>
        <p>The British news media have long identified Blazer as one member of the executive committee who was leaning toward voting in favor of the English bid. Blazer asserts he has not made up his mind.</p>
        <p>''It's clear from what I've read and seen that it would be very difficult to vote for England,'' Blazer said.</p>
        <p>Major League Soccer</p>
        <p>Columbus striker Brian McBride, who returned to the club after three matches in the Nike U.S. Cup with the national team, fractured his right cheekbone vying for a head ball on Saturday in the Crew's 0-0 draw in Colorado. McBride, who is scheduled to have surgery today, is expected to be out four to eight weeks and could miss the start of World Cup qualifying matches.</p>
        <p>Miami's Roy Lassiter, the league's career leading scorer, has been benched by Coach Ray Hudson. Lassiter started the first 14 games for the Fusion but scored only three goals and four assists. In his previous four years in the league with D.C. United and Tampa Bay, Lassiter has scored 73 goals and 25 assists. Keep in mind that he has played with skilled midfielder distributors: Carlos Valderrama in Tampa Bay (1996) and Marco Etcheverry in Washington (1998 and 1999).</p>
        <p>Tampa Bay lost by 2-1 in Los Angeles on Saturday night in a game in which Valderrama missed a penalty kick. So far this season, the Mutiny has converted only two of five penalty kicks.</p>
        <p>After much cajoling by officials of Major League Soccer, ESPN2 last night began broadcasting M.L.S. Extra Time, a weekly highlights program at 11 p.m. Eastern time. The program will run for 13 weeks, through the end of the league's regular season.</p>
        <p>Tampa Bay's Valderrama, who leads the league with 14 assists, is the top vote-getter (15,832) in fan balloting for the All-Star Game, which will be played July 29 in Columbus, Ohio. Fans will select the starting 11 for each team (in a</p>
        <p>3-5-2 alignment). Adolfo Valencia of the MetroStars is the top vote-getter (9,546) among forwards in the East. MetroStars goalkeeper Mike Ammann is also in the lead by a wide margin. Inexplicably, Lothar Matthaus leads all midfielders with an astounding 13,317 votes. Matthaus is now in Europe playing for Germany in the European Championships and the MetroStars have been better without him. The Germans, without a victory, could be eliminated today.</p>
        <p>The suddenly proficient MetroStars are 6-1 when they score the game's first goal. ... Kansas City, a 4-1 loser in Dallas on Saturday night on three second-half goals, allowed the game's first goal for only the second time this season. After a 10-0-2 start, the Wizards have lost two of their past three games. ... After a scoreless first half, D.C. United and Chicago combined for five goals in only 15 minutes in the Fire's 3-2 victory. ... San Jose, in last place in the Western Division (4-7-4) is 4-0-2 at home and 0-7-2 on the road.</p>
        <p>United States Women</p>
        <p>Fresh off the Pacific Cup championship in Australia, the United States women's national team returns to action on Friday in the nightcap of the opening doubleheader of the inaugural Concacaf Women's Gold Cup in Hershey, Pa.</p>
        <p>The United States is scheduled to play Trinidad &amp; Tobago (ESPN, 8 p.m.) at Hersheypark Stadium, after a 5:30 p.m. match between Brazil and Costa Rica. China, Guatemala, Canada and Mexico are also in the tournament.</p>
        <p>The Americans play Costa Rica in Louisville, Ky., on Sunday (ESPN2, 4 p.m.) and then close out the first round against Brazil in Foxboro, Mass., next Tuesday (ESPN, 8 p.m.). The tournament's semifinals will be played on July 1 in Louisville and the final in Foxboro on July 3.</p>
        <p>Briana Scurry, who was expected to return in goal for the United States after missing all but one match so far this year with injuries, was forced to drop out because of lingering shin problems. Scurry had hoped to earn her 100th international cap against Trinidad. Her spot on the roster was taken by 18-year-old Jenni Branam, who will back up Siri Mullinix.</p>
        <p>Corner Kick</p>
        <p>United States Coach Bruce Arena was in Guatemala on Sunday on a scouting mission when Antigua and Barbuda became the 48th team among the 196 entered to be eliminated in qualifying for the 2002 World Cup. Arena's team will open play on July 16 in Guatemala.</p>
