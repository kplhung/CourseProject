        <p>This is a 30-second commercial that Representative Rick A. Lazio's campaign says it will begin broadcasting this week in all the major television markets around the state. Titled ''Guess What,'' it is Mr. Lazio's second campaign advertisement, and is a response to attack ads his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, began broadcasting last week.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- The Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome Agency.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Mr. Lazio, dressed in a dark blazer and a casual shirt, sits in what appears to be a study, with bookcases and a picture of his two young daughters behind him. Mr. Lazio, smiling throughout, speaks directly into the camera.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''I've been in the Senate campaign for about a month now, and guess what? Hillary Clinton has already started running attack ads designed to fool you about me. Her ads are simply untrue. I voted for a patients' bill of rights, and I oppose hate crimes. So why is she doing this? Because it's a lot easier for Mrs. Clinton to attack me than to name a single thing she has ever done for New York. So Mrs. Clinton, you can run the negative campaign about tearing people down. I'm going to run a campaign about building New York up.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Lazio's ad refers to two 15-second attack ads Mrs. Clinton began broadcasting on Friday, one focusing on health care legislation known as the patients' bill of rights and the other on the State Senate's approval of legislation stiffening penalties for crimes motivated by hatred toward ethnic and racial groups or sexual orientation. In his own ad, Mr. Lazio says he voted for a patients' bill of rights, and the ''a'' is important because the issue is a highly partisan one. On June 8, the Senate narrowly defeated a Democratic bill that would have allowed patients to sue their health maintenance organizations, a bill that had earlier been opposed by Mr. Lazio in the House. Mr. Lazio has supported Republican versions of managed care legislation that would have provided things like new tax deductions to help people pay medical bills. On hate crimes, Mr. Lazio may oppose them, but he has been less certain on legislation intended to address them. A week before the State Senate passed its legislation, he told an interviewer he opposed it. After the State Senate approved a hate crimes bill, Mr. Lazio changed his stance and said he supported it. Mr. Lazio has also used negative campaigning, and has faced criticism for attacking Mrs. Clinton in his nomination speech and on a campaign tour upstate.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Mr. Lazio could set himself up for charges of hypocrisy by bemoaning Mrs. Clinton's negative tenor while adopting one himself with the inclusion of his remark suggesting that Mrs. Clinton has not done ''a single thing'' for New York. Mr. Lazio's parsing of his stances on health care and hate crimes has already fed Democrats bent on criticizing what they consider his wavering stances. Mr. Lazio's dress-down attire and the warm setting evoke the comfort he wants people to feel about him, though some might say he appears a bit casual at a time when he is trying make a distinguished impression among voters who, according to recent polls, hardly know him.</p>
