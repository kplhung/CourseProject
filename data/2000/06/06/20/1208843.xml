        <p>Vice President Al Gore has learned from his boss. With Clintonesque strokes he has put together a retirement plan that extracts the best part of Gov. George W. Bush's proposal, leaving the governor to defend the unpopular parts, such as the likely need to cut promised Social Security benefits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush proposes to create private savings accounts by diverting part of the Social Security payroll tax. Mr. Gore is expected to announce today that he would help families set up individual retirement accounts without touching Social Security money. But his plan, unlike Mr. Bush's, would raise national saving, help low- and moderate-income families more than high-income families and pose no threat to basic Social Security benefits.</p>

        <p>Vice President Al Gore has learned from his boss. With Clintonesque strokes he has put together a retirement plan that extracts the best part of Gov. George W. Bush's proposal, leaving the governor to defend the unpopular parts, such as the likely need to cut promised Social Security benefits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush proposes to create private savings accounts by diverting part of the Social Security payroll tax. Mr. Gore is expected to announce today that he would help families set up individual retirement accounts without touching Social Security money. But his plan, unlike Mr. Bush's, would raise national saving, help low- and moderate-income families more than high-income families and pose no threat to basic Social Security benefits.</p>
        <p>The Gore plan would work like 401(k) savings plans except that the government, not employers, would provide the matching funds. A married couple making $30,000 could contribute up to $1,000 a year and receive an extra $3,000 in tax credits -- a 3-for-1 match. The tax credit would be refundable so that even a family with no income tax liability would receive the full $3,000. The federal grant phases out so that a couple making $100,000 would receive only a $1,000 credit if it made a $3,000 deposit, a 1-for-3 match. The account would not be taxed until withdrawals during retirement, though families could withdraw money earlier for catastrophic medical expenses or college tuition or to buy a first home. Early withdrawals are designed to persuade low-income families to participate.</p>
        <p>Republicans accused Mr. Gore of hypocritically proposing a concept -- investing personal retirement money in stocks -- that he labeled ''risky'' when proposed by Mr. Bush. The criticism is misplaced. Investing basic retirement money in stocks can be imprudent. But investing additional money in stocks and bonds once the family's basic Social Security retirement benefit is preserved poses nowhere near the same type of risk.</p>
        <p>The tax code already includes deductions for 401(k) and other types of retirement accounts. In general, wealthy families participate more frequently than others. Mr. Gore's proposal, because it relies on refundable credits rather than deductions and provides a larger match for the savings of low-income families, would be steeply progressive.</p>
        <p>Progressivity is key to promoting savings. The economics profession is divided on whether 401(k) and other tax-subsidized accounts actually raise savings, the lifeblood of investment and growth, or merely shift existing savings out of ordinary savings accounts into tax-favored accounts. But even William Gale of the Brookings Institution, whose research raises doubts whether existing tax breaks raise savings, predicts that Mr. Gore's plan will work. It is focused on low-income families that save very little now and will almost certainly have to save more to put money into Mr. Gore's program.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Bush's plan, Mr. Gore's would help families build wealth that they could leave for their heirs. But unlike Mr. Bush's plan, Mr. Gore would boost private wealth without putting any basic Social Security retirement benefits at risk.</p>
