        <p>Publicis S.A., which last month lost out to the WPP Group in an effort to buy Young &amp; Rubicam Inc., plans to buy Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the British agency company descended from the empire of the acquisitive Saatchi brothers, for at least $1.5 billion in stock, advertising executives close to the deal said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Saatchi &amp; Saatchi unexpectedly disclosed yesterday that its executives had been approached to begin discussions that could result in an offer for the agency company, the world's 11th largest in terms of billings and revenue. Though the terms of the proposed deal were not disclosed and the potential acquirer was not identified, shares of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi climbed 27 percent in London, giving the agency company a market value of more than $1.4 billion.</p>
        <p>Advertising executives close to the deal said that Publicis would acquire Saatchi &amp; Saatchi for $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in stock. The deal would significantly increase the Publicis presence in the United States, the world's largest advertising market.</p>
        <p>Maurice Levy, the chairman and chief executive of Publicis -- which has a worldwide ranking of eighth in billings and ninth in revenue -- scheduled a news conference in Paris for this morning on a topic he declined to discuss. Mr. Levy is expected to lead the merged company.</p>
        <p>The acquisition would be further evidence of the growing appeal of independent agency companies as the consolidation of the advertising industry that began six years ago continues at a breakneck pace.</p>
        <p>''The increasing globalization of brand marketing is accelerating due to the Web,'' said Leland Westerfield, an analyst with PaineWebber in New York. ''Saatchi &amp; Saatchi could probably operate favorably on its own, but agencies need to grow on a global basis to serve key clients.''</p>
        <p>The pending acquisition of Y.&amp; R., based in New York, by WPP, based in London, would create the world's biggest agency company in both categories. A hookup with Saatchi &amp; Saatchi as a kind of consolation prize for Publicis would create the fifth-largest agency company in billings and revenue.</p>
        <p>''WPP and Y.&amp; R. took the gloves off in terms of the size of the deals,'' said Michael J. Russell Jr., an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York. ''Now we're talking about bigger names.''</p>
        <p>''Six months ago, this would have been hard to accept,'' he added, referring to a combination of Publicis with Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. 'Now it's 'Of course.' ''</p>
        <p>Spokesmen at both agency companies declined to discuss the negotiations.</p>
        <p>''All we can say is that we received an approach that may or may not result in a merger offer,'' said Richard Walters at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in London, adding: ''I can't say any more. Watch this space.''</p>
        <p>His counterpart at Publicis, Seth Goldschlager, said he would not comment on ''market speculation.''</p>
        <p>Needless to say, there is no similar inhibition among industry analysts and deal makers, who relished discussing what might become of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.</p>
        <p>''It's one of the ones that had to go,'' said Abbott Jones, managing director at AdMedia Partners in New York, which specializes in transactions involving agencies and media companies. ''There aren't that many left.''</p>
        <p>Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Publicis are among six independent agency companies that have been consistently identified by analysts as ready to buy or be bought; the others are the Cordiant Communications Group, Grey Advertising, Havas Advertising and True North Communications.</p>
        <p>''Megaagencies are in a wonderful position to handle the business of megaclients,'' said Alan J. Gottesman, who follows advertising for West End Communications in New York.</p>
        <p>Though Publicis has already acquired several American agencies, including Fallon, Hal Riney &amp; Partners, the Evans Group and Frankel, owning Saatchi &amp; Saatchi will offer additional opportunities to work with blue-chip marketers like General Mills, Hewlett-Packard and Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>
        <p>The deal would require the blessings of giant clients of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi like Procter &amp; Gamble and Toyota, which make up more than a third of the agency company's billings, by Mr. Jones's estimate. There could be some difficulties on that front because agencies now owned by Publicis work for competitors of those companies like L'Oreal, General Motors and Renault.</p>
        <p>''The major clients dictate the marriage partner,'' Mr. Jones said. ''Look to the clients and you have the possibilities.''</p>
        <p>The deal will move forward, he added, if the merged agency company ''can handle P.&amp; G. and Toyota without getting in trouble.''</p>
        <p>Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was founded by Maurice Saatchi and his brother, Charles, and won widespread recognition for its ads that helped bring Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative Party to power in Britain. The agency grew rapidly during the 1980's with a spate of deals.</p>
        <p>The debt from those deals, poorly received plans to expand beyond advertising and the global recession all combined to wound Saatchi &amp; Saatchi deeply during the early and mid- 1990's. That enabled two American agency companies, the Interpublic Group of Companies and the Omnicom Group, to race ahead by making acquisitions of their own.</p>
        <p>''Interpublic and Omnicom have had 10 years of practice in getting it right,'' Mr. Gottesman at West End Communications said.</p>
        <p>Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's recovery from its missteps was hampered by a bitter dispute that emerged between the Saatchi brothers and the agency company's board, which led to their departure at the end of 1994. As they formed their own agency, M&amp;C Saatchi, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was renamed Cordiant P.L.C.</p>
        <p>Three years later, Cordiant was ''demerged'' to form two separate agency companies, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Bates Worldwide, later renamed the Cordiant Communications Group. Cordiant Communications shares also climbed yesterday in London, rising 12.3 percent.</p>
        <p>The Saatchi &amp; Saatchi disclosure ''identifies the value of Cordiant'' to investors, said Andy Boland, investor relations director at Cordiant Communications in London, as the number of independent agency companies of their size keeps dwindling. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Cordiant Communications each own 50 percent of Zenith Media, a worldwide media services and research agency.</p>
        <p>Saatchi &amp; Saatchi has recently been selling interests in units outside its core agency like Siegel &amp; Gale, a corporate identity consulting company now known as Siegelgale.com; and Cliff Freeman &amp; Partners, a creatively focused shop in New York. The trade publication PR Week reported last month that the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi public relations agency, Rowland Worldwide, would be sold to Edelman Public Relations Worldwide in New York.</p>
        <p>The 27 percent increase yesterday in the price of shares of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was arked the largest single gain since it began trading separately from Cordiant in December 1997. In trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, the American depository shares of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi climbed $7.6875, or 30.3 percent, to $33.0625.</p>
