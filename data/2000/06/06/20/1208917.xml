        <p>As black clergy and political leaders in Yonkers prepared to protest the firing of the city's first black schools superintendent, others yesterday debated whether the dispute that had led to his firing had to do with race or simply with money.</p>
        <p>The city's school board fired the superintendent, Andre J. Hornsby, on Friday, at the height of his months-long battle with Mayor John Spencer over whether the city should remain under a court-ordered desegregation program.</p>
        <p>Led by the minister of the Messiah Baptist Church, some black residents vowed to risk arrest by demonstrating outside City Hall tomorrow.</p>
        <p>The mayor, some critics said, was trying to appeal to white voters by effectively ignoring a school system with a minority population that had increased to about 75 percent from 35 percent over the last 16 years.</p>
        <p>''Andre Hornsby was brought in because he was an African-American educator who the mayor thought would be his front person to return to neighborhood schools,'' said Michael Sussman, a lawyer for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The N.A.A.C.P. is contending in a court appeal that the schools are still suffering from the effects of segregation.</p>
        <p>''He was a black face,'' Mr. Sussman said, ''and he could front the end of this case because how could anybody oppose what the first black superintendent had done? But now they see Andre Hornsby isn't going to pipe down and play their tune, so they fired him.''</p>
        <p>The school board fired Dr. Hornsby in a 5-to-3 vote and appointed a former city official and high school principal who is black, Joseph Farmer, as interim superintendent. Darryl George, a Baptist minister, told his congregation on Sunday that the city was merely trying to appease black residents by appointing a black man to the position.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hornsby was fired after months of making public statements that the schools were still racially segregated, a position directly opposite the mayor's.</p>
        <p>A year ago, a federal court ruled that there was not enough evidence to show that discrimination was behind a gap in test scores between black and white students. As a result, the state cut $47 million that it had been required to pay for programs ordered by a 1986 court ruling in which Yonkers was found to have segregated minority children to poorer schools.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hornsby, who arrived in Yonkers in 1998, wanted to appeal the decision so the schools could get money from the state and the city, which the court also ruled was responsible for ending the segregation.</p>
        <p>The mayor was eager to rid the city of the federal control and the stigma of the desegregation order. At his urging, and against Dr. Hornsby's recommendation, the school board voted not to appeal the case. Its lawyers had prepared a report outlining vestiges of segregation in the city's schools, but the board declined to submit that report to the court. The report was then leaked to the N.A.A.C.P., which used it to argue its appeal.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hornsby had derided the mayor publicly in recent months, saying Mr. Spencer did not support the schools. That open combativeness, and not racism, others said, led to his dismissal.</p>
        <p>''This was certainly not a fight about race,'' said Raymond P. Fitzpatrick Jr., a lawyer who represents the city. ''There are apparently legitimate differences between the superintendent and the board about how to manage the school system. The city continues to believe it's time for federal court intervention to end.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fitzpatrick said the city planned to continue the programs put in place under the desegregation order. Michael M. Weibrecht, a school board member, said the most important task facing the board, even before finding a new superintendent, was coming up with a workable budget.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hornsby, both men said, had shown that he could not work cooperatively with the board and the mayor on that task. In addition, he had lost the support of the teachers' union during a protracted strike this year. The teachers objected to Dr. Hornsby's plan to impose a schedule made up of 90-minute blocks, instead of the traditional 45-minute periods.</p>
