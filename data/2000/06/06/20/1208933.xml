        <p>The Seagram Company, the spirits and entertainment company that includes such legendary names as Absolut vodka, Universal Studios and Polygram Records, is expected to announce today that it has agreed to be acquired for about $34 billion in stock by Vivendi S.A., a French water utility that is transforming itself into a telecommunications and entertainment giant.</p>

        <p>The Seagram Company, the spirits and entertainment company that includes such legendary names as Absolut vodka, Universal Studios and Polygram Records, is expected to announce today that it has agreed to be acquired for about $34 billion in stock by Vivendi S.A., a French water utility that is transforming itself into a telecommunications and entertainment giant.</p>
        <p>The sale would amount to one of the largest media deals ever and would end the Bronfman family's control over Seagram, which Samuel Bronfman took over in 1928. It has remained one of the nation's most powerful liquor companies even as Edgar Bronfman Jr., a grandson of Samuel Bronfman, began remaking the company into a media player in 1995, by first acquiring MCA, parent of Universal Pictures, which produced such American icons as ''E.T.'' and ''The Sting.''</p>
        <p>One of the nation's six major film studios, Universal also owns a television production company, theme parks and a music business. In 1998, Mr. Bronfman expanded Seagram's holdings by buying Polygram, making Seagram the nation's largest record company in terms of sales. That purchase reflected Mr. Bronfman's conviction that music was a growth business.</p>
        <p>The new company will be called Vivendi Universal and be based in Paris. Mr. Bronfman will become vice chairman, with the music and Internet businesses reporting to him. Vivendi executives do not see the liquor business as part of the company's future and plan to sell all of it, or at least a stake in it.</p>
        <p>Vivendi hopes to leverage Seagram's library of films and music by distributing it over its mobile telephone network in France, as well as through its ambitious pan-European Internet portal, called Vizzavi, and its pay television company, Canal Plus; Vivendi owns 49 percent of Canal and now plans to buy it outright.</p>
        <p>The proposed deal is a bet by both Vivendi and Seagram that combining popular content with a powerful distribution system, especially the next generation of wireless Internet services in Europe, can create a company worth more combined than the value of its parts.</p>
        <p>Boards of Vivendi and Canal Plus confirmed the deal yesterday; a Seagram spokeswoman declined to comment, but several people close to the Seagram board said that it, too, had approved the deal.</p>
        <p>There were, however, some skeptics yesterday who felt that Vivendi was unlikely to cull great benefits from merging. One analyst who requested anonymity said that while Canal Plus was getting use of the Universal Pictures film library to fill its programming needs and Vivendi believed it could download music digitally via cell phones, ''maybe you are accelerating that synergy, but I think it is a small niche.''</p>
        <p>The merger, which also needs approval from the European Union, is the latest in a series of aggressive media mergers that have seen the entertainment world consolidate into a handful of major entities. The first wave, which began in the 1980's, included mergers of movie and television production with companies that could distribute their programs on hardware or cable or TV -- Sony and Columbia; Time and Warner; Viacom and Paramount, and then CBS; and the Walt Disney Company and Capital Cities/ABC. Seagram's purchase of MCA was unusual because Seagram was not a media company, though it believed it brought international marketing expertise to MCA.</p>
        <p>But despite the high degree of publicity surrounding most media deals, it has generally taken far longer for the stock of merged companies to benefit than the initial frenzied corporate sales pitch would have indicated. For example, Time Warner's stock lagged the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index for years after its 1989 merger until it suddenly took off two years ago. Stock in Walt Disney still trails the S.&amp; P. 500 more than four years after it bought ABC. Viacom's stock, too, has often trailed the index since 1994, though it has outperformed the index recently and its stock has benefited from the CBS deal. Most recently, Seagram bought Polygram, a major record company. But Seagram, too, had underperformed the market until the recent takeover announcement.</p>
        <p>If it has been tough to realize any immediate benefits from combining, it may be in part because ''the merged companies have not focused so much on cost savings as potential revenue growth to be gained from combining the entities,'' said David Londoner, a media analyst at ABN Amro.</p>
        <p>In the second wave of deals, including AOL's pending purchase of Time-Warner, technology companies have begun seeking to own ''content'' providers like major film companies.</p>
        <p>Vivendi's deal fits more directly in that category. Somewhat like Seagram under the control of Mr. Bronfman, Vivendi has been transformed under the leadership of Jean-Marie Messier, the French company's chairman, into a holding company of sorts with a hodgepodge of old-  and new-economy businesses.</p>
        <p>While Vivendi very much remains a water distribution, waste management and construction company -- more than half of its $40 billion in revenue come from those divisions -- Mr. Messier has been steadily building an impressive stable of telecommunication and entertainment properties. Vivendi now owns a 24.5 percent stake in the satellite television business British Sky Broadcasting, controlled by the News Corporation. It owns 59 percent of Cegetel, which operates SFR, the second-largest wireless telephone network in France. Mr. Messier, 43, also acquired Havas, the publishing and advertising company and last year increased Vivendi's stake in Canal Plus by 15 percentage points, to 49 percent.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Mr. Messier's most important deal to date was a negotiating move in February to create an Internet portal with Vodafone Airtouch, the world's largest wireless telephone operator. That deal sealed the fate of Vodafone's record $183 billion hostile bid for Mannesmann and gave Mr. Messier an important ally in expanding his wireless operations, which so far remain mostly in France.</p>
        <p>Initially the combined companies would have revenue of $65 billion, though the sale of the liquor business and Vivendi's water business, which includes U.S. Filter, would reduce the company to a purer media business.</p>
        <p>The sale, for $72.76 a share, is a 44 percent premium over Seagram's stock price before news of the deal began to circulate last Tuesday. But Vivendi stock, which has soared over the last year, began falling from its high of $136 in March and has continued to fall since news of the deal, closing yesterday at $92.25. The terms of the deal will vary somewhat, depending on how Vivendi's stock continues to perform.</p>
        <p>Over the last seven days, rumors of the takeover pushed Seagram stock to $63.75 from $50.625, a 26.4 percent gain, increasing the family's stake by $1.4 billion, to about $6.8 billion.</p>
        <p>Vivendi has certain advantages compared with the players in some of the earlier deals. The sale is for stock, so that it does not have to take on additional debt. And a sale of the liquor interests, which could generate more than $7 billion according to several analysts, including Ed Hatch of SG Cowen, would wipe out Seagram's existing debt.</p>
        <p>Vivendi's hopes of using Seagram's huge music operations to provide content for its new wireless Internet business have been questioned, partly because of doubts about the record industry's ability to maintain control over the revenue from distribution of music. There is fear that consumers can use the Internet to circumvent traditional distribution, and get their music free.</p>
        <p>Mr. Messier is betting that the industry will find a new revenue model for selling music over the Internet and will start an industry-wide secure distribution effort.</p>
        <p>Mr. Messier's ambition to put Seagram's entertainment companies under the Vivendi umbrella is part of his effort to deliver content over his various media outlets and most importantly over his wireless network and through Vizzavi. In Europe, where mobile telephones and wireless access devices have penetrated the market much more than in the United States, Mr. Messier is betting that the next generation of mobile devices will not only act as telephones or personal organizers, but also effectively work as portable music players and televisions.</p>
        <p>There was mixed guessing yesterday in Hollywood about Mr. Bronfman's role, with some saying that Mr. Bronfman would be left to run the record business because he had done a good job with Seagram's music operation and Mr. Messier had little interest in that area. Others speculated that Mr. Bronfman's tenure was only a matter of time, because he was unlikely to enjoy working for anyone and that a sticking point in initial talks had been Mr. Messier's unwillingness to assure him a major operating role.</p>
        <p>What worries analysts is that Vivendi stock has more than tripled since the beginning of 1998 until March 10, when it peaked at $136.50. As one industry executive, who insisted on anonymity, put it: ''For Vivendi, it is simply doing a deal with its inflated stock. That is, unless the stock continues to fall.''</p>
        <p>As part of the deal, Vivendi will buy the remaining 51 percent of Canal Plus that it does not already own for more than $12 billion, according to executives close to the talks. Vivendi will pay Canal Plus shareholders two of its own shares for each share of Canal Plus, the executives said.</p>
        <p>To satisfy a French law that restricts any one company from owning more than 49 percent of a French television broadcaster, Vivendi is expected to spin off the Canal Plus French broadcasting unit into a separate company.</p>
