        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>A ROLE FOR BRADLEY -- Democratic Party officials say Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley, his onetime rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, have worked out matters to the point that Mr. Bradley can expect a prominent speaking role at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. Asked over the weekend if Mr. Bradley would get a ''prime time'' role, the convention manager, Terry McAuliffe, a close Gore ally, told CNN, ''I think he will.'' Mr. McAuliffe also said President Clinton would have a prominent speaking role at the convention, most likely on opening night. But ultimately, Mr. McAuliffe said, ''this whole convention is about Al Gore, his vision for the future, what he is going to do as president.'' Convention planners also expect Hillary Rodham Clinton to address the convention.</p>

        <p>CLINTON IN TEXAS -- President Clinton ventured onto Gov. George W. Bush's Texas turf yesterday for the third time this year to raise money for Democratic candidates. Stopping in Houston and Austin, Mr. Clinton raised $1 million to help elect Democrats to the Senate and encourage Hispanic voters to turn out on Election Day. Mr. Clinton argued that there are sharp differences between the governor and Vice President Al Gore, who he said had the better plan to keep the national economy growing. The president also took Senate Republicans to task for stalling confirmation of some of his judicial nominees. He cited the Senate's failure to vote on Enrique Moreno, who was nominated for the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. ''From humble beginnings in El Paso, he established, first of all, an utterly brilliant academic career,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''I might add, more brilliant than that of virtually everyone who'd be voting on his confirmation.''</p>

        <p>GORE ON GAS PRICES -- As gasoline prices in the Midwest escalate, so does the concern of Vice President Al Gore, who, as part of the Clinton administration, could be held politically accountable. He suggested yesterday that the big oil companies might be fixing prices. ''The big oil companies' profits have gone up 500 percent in the first part of this year, just the time when these prices are going sky high in the Midwest,'' Mr. Gore said in an interview with ABC News. ''I think that justifies a much broader investigation into possible collusion, price gouging and antitrust violations.'' Later in the day, he focused on the economy. At a fund-raising dinner in Washington for the Democratic National Committee, Mr. Gore said the nation's economic turnaround had been brought about by Clinton policies. Fifty-five people paid $10,000 each to join him and Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, who had endorsed Mr. Gore's rival, former Senator Bill Bradley, in the primaries. Mr. Kerrey called Mr. Gore ''the most qualified person in my lifetime'' to be running for president.</p>
